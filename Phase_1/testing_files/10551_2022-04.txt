command 3 out and had a clear margin at the wire. AWESOME ADRIAN settled towards the back, closed the gap after the 14th to track the leader through
the stretch but could not gain further ground on that rival. GOODOLDTIMES (IRE) was well placed and always in range, was right there two fences from
home the flattened out. POCKET TALK (IRE) led the way from the start, started to give way about a half mile from home, then tired through the stretch run.
STAND DOWN (IRE) trailed throughout. . ROYAL RUSE, was in contention when he fell at the second last walked off.
