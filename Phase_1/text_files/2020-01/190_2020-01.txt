Footnotes
DOLL assumed a forward position, prompted the issue primarily from the three path, steadily increased her presence during the run around the bend,
challenged in earnest four wide at the three-sixteenths pole, wrested away the advantage by the beginning of the last eighth, drifted out slightly afterwards
from left side stick work but held sway. MIDNIGHT BANKER gunned to the top, vied with the winner while racing in the two path, was put to a drive spinning
into the lane, saw the top over during the ensuing furlong, stayed on well enough to save second. ALPHADORA pursued the pace two to three wide on the
turn, fanned out into the five path from upper to midstretch, flashed some late foot, missed out on the place. ENOUGH LOVE tracked the front runners from
just off the inside route, went into the lane under some encouragement, lacked a solid closing punch. FUNDERELLA travelled two to three wide on the turn,
angled into the four path entering the stretch, made no impact. PENDOLINO three wide departing the backstretch, was about as wide coming into the lane,
never made her presence felt. BELIEF CURE took the inside route for the opening half, was moved out four wide into the lane, had no offering.

Footnotes
LA NEGRITA broke out at the start brushing the off side stall, raced four wide in aim of the front down the backstretch, advanced tucking to the two path into
the turn to issue a challenge near the three-eighths, took over narrow command at that station, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and an off sided stick and drifted out through the length of the stretch despite it to the finish to the center of the
course coming under threat because of it, but was able to hold on by a neck to prevail. MY SWEET KAT established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn coming under pressure to the outside by the aforementioned foe and was headed for
the front three furlongs from home, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting out
slightly running on and steadily gaining as the leader took the scenic route, but was ultimately repelled at the end. WICKED HAPPY chased along the inside
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and kept on under a drive through the stretch to be along clear for the show honors.
KIT KAT KATIE broke out at the start bumping ROMA CARPE in tandem with WICKED KHEISHA and pinching that rival back, chased just off the inside
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position. KEMBA chased inside early on before tipping three
wide through the turn put to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals in the drive. WICKED
KHEISHA broke in at the start bumping ROMA CARPE in concert with KIT KAT KATIE and pinching back that rival, chased five to six paths off the inside
down the backstretch and through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued five to six wide for home and made no impact.
ANNOULA four wide in pursuit under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide for home, tired in the stretch. ROMA CARPE got bumped between
foes who each broke her way and was pinched back at the start, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through
the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. MUSICAL THUNDER timed the opening of the gate with a slight
lunge and was away to a sharp start, led early on and showed brief speed three to four wide down the backstretch and into the turn, came under coaxing
three furlongs out backing away, went five wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
CAMORRA established the top in short order, cut over towards the inside, showed the way spaced at a slight distance from off the rail, rider holding
something in reserve, was still doing so even with all the others under drives themselves late on the bend, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was given
her cue, responded and scampered away. MA MEATLOAF fell back on the backstretch after breaking in line with the top one, was in the two path stalking
that opponent on the turn, got put to a drive for the drive home, wound up in the three path at the head of the stretch, proved no match. COOL AS YOU
LIKE took up the chase from the three path on the turn, was set down at the five-sixteenths pole, swung out towards path five entering into the stretch, went
on to secure the show. TIZ A KITTEN underwent a ground-saving journey, managed to stay somewhat within striking distance on the turn while being ridden
along, stepped into the lane and had no rally. MOVIE SCORE four wide entering the turn, was sent out into the six path exiting it, trailed throughout while
racing as the widest of all.

TAN AND TIGHT broke in at the start bumping QUASAR in tandem with WE ARE FAMILY, came under hustling and raced four wide in aim of the front,
advanced four wide through the turn issuing a challenge through the latter portion of the bend coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and taking over
command before continuing four wide at that station and into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive through to the finish. JASMINESQUE took the overland
route six paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch, offered
up a mild kick to close in belatedly and secure the place honors. RAPIDO GATTA brushed the near side stall at the start and came under hustling to range
up and take command shortly after the break, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from LAQUEZZA to the outside and WE ARE
FAMILY along the inside, shook off the inner foe into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, got headed for the front near the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. LAQUEZZA coaxed from the gate, prompted the
aforementioned foe from the outside in the three path, got placed to coaxing taking narrow command at the five-sixteenths between foes, yielded the front
and swung three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. LOVELY LUCKY chased five wide under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. QUASAR bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, chased two to three
wide under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. WE ARE FAMILY broke out at the start bumping QUASAR in
concert with TAN AND TIGHT, raced forwardly placed along the inside prompting the leader down the backstretch, got shaken off a bit into the turn and
chased along the rail through the turn under coaxing from midway, angled four wide for home and tired.

DIRECT ORDER took up residence in midpack after an apparent clean getaway, sat parked out four to five wide on the turn, the widest of all, got cued up
swinging slightly wider into the stretch, closed in with good energy, struck the front in the general area of the sixteenth pole and edged away. WIN WITH
PRIDE was just off the inside arguing for the top while matched up with CALIFORNIA NIGHT, got set down at the quarter pole, regained the advantage only
to have the winner burst upon the scene from the outside, relinquished approximately a sixteenth down the road, held on well to salvage second.
CALIFORNIA NIGHT sparred with WIN WITH PRIDE while being two to three wide, was put to a ride turning into the stretch, had the lead snatched away,
battled onward, weakened late into the show slot. COLTANDMISSISSIPPI away last after breaking to the outside awkwardly with his initial step, was over
on the rail soon afterwards, slipped to the outside at the five-sixteenths pole, angled into the path three for the drive and was fed its cue, narrowed in
displaying some willingness, steadied when pinched at the eighth pole, altered course onto the inside route, failed to muster up its earlier interest, then
continued to be asked, but on the milder side in the last sixteenth, en route for the final significant slice of the pot. MAD MUNNYS four wide both on the turn
and in upper stretch, gave way. THOUSAND PERCENT worked out a tuck into the two path at the half mile pole, chased the pace from midpack, shifted out
six wide once in the stretch, lacked the needed response. BITUMEN travelled three to four wide on the turn, fanned out into path seven from upper to
midlane, came up empty. HARDCORE FOLKLORE pursued the pace towards the two path on the turn, was asked to pick it up by the five-sixteenths pole,
angled five wide into the lane, had no rally.

JENNEMILY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, remained patiently handled in behind the front until set down
angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining outside and was up in the late stages inching away to the finish to prevail. FIGURE
IT OUT six paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased three to four wide through the turn advancing under her own power to take command near the
quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, edged away to the eighth pole, dug in under a drive and was caught in the late going while
clear for the place honors. PRIVATE BEACH hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the
two path half a mile from home, came under increasing pressure to the outside and was placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded command and
went two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. TEAM WIN four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the inside at the
half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, angled out to the five or six path near the eighth pole and
offered up a mild bid. TRIAL AND ERROR took the overland route chasing eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn coming under a drive at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and came up empty. GRACETOWN seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and faltered.

to the outside near the top of the backstretch once NONSENSICAL went off winging it, most likely in an attempt to bottom out the field, departed the
backstretch from the two path, picked up interest after the pilot resorted to some hand urging on the second bend, struck the front a short distance from the
quarter pole, ventured onward for another sixteenth before finally being given her cue, responded, digging in gamely to fend off the second place finisher.
LUCKY MOVE sat strung three wide on both turns, closed the gap springing from the three-eighths pole, turned into the lane and after settling in was set
down, got hooked up a spirited tussle with the winner, vied with vigour to the wire but was staved off. ANOTHER BROAD reserved two wide until the end of
the second bend, was asked for run for the drive home, got outfinished. ENTROPIA (ARG) saved ground until the quarter pole, had no response after
angling three wide into the stretch. NONSENSICAL tucked into the two path heading for the conclusion of the homestretch, shadowed the winner from the
outside on the first turn, stepped onto the backstretch, picked up speed without being asked and went on assume control, moved inward, opening up a
comfortable lead all the while, faced some pressure after three-quarters had been reeled off, got overhauled leaving the five-sixteenths pole, fell back while
being ridden for the opening half of the stretch run, then was allowed to fade away being protected afterwards.

Footnotes
GLENN LIKES GIN six to seven paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch from mid pack, tucked three wide through the turn, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, shied in under an off sided stick after being straightened away finding himself in the four path
and was corrected, shied in to the two path a furlong out once more briefly under an off sided stick, rallied gaining ground inside that station and was tipped
out from in behind TAPIZEARANCE a sixteenth from home before splitting that foe and another late to get up in the last jumps and prevail on the wire.
UNRELENTING FORCE six paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked four to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, continued four to five wide for home, dug in under a drive in contention from the head of the stretch through to the finish and was up for
the place honors in the final jumps. TAPIZEARANCE bobbled at the break and was bumped by DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT due to pressure outside from MR.
TAG, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, took over command
at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat fending off the aforementioned foe until collared by the top one, then got outfinished late for the place honors
while clear for the show. VALID QUEST coaxed from the gate, dueled from the five path in hand with DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT to his inside down the
backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and shook off his main pace rival swinging three to four wide for
home confronted by a pair, dug in between those rivals and yielded the front three-sixteenths from home, weakened in the late stages. MR. FIDGET five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. POLITICAL eight paths off the inside down the backstretch early on, tucked to the five path at the five-eighths, came
under coaxing tucked three to four wide at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MR. TAG broke in at the start
bumping LIAMS MAJESTY into DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT and in turn TAPIZEARANCE, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. LIAMS MAJESTY shied in slightly and was
bumped at the start by MR. TAG and in turn bumped DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT into TAPIZEARANCE losing the near side iron as a result and jostling briefly
with MR. TAG soon after the start, chased four wide from near the rear coming under prolonged coaxing five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path into
the turn, went four to five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT bumped between foes at the start, ranged up
to duel in hand three then two wide with VALID QUEST to his outside, began to get shaken off near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch and
folded in the drive while not persevered with to the finish.
