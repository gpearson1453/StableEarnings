Footnotes
ALWAYS broke a step slow, racing in the back, moved up four wide around the second turn, made a wide rally and finished strong. D TWO pressed the
pace, racing three wide down the backside, took the lead at the head of the home stretch, but proved no match for the winner late. J P'S PRIDE (IRE) was
an early factor, racing five wide around the first turn, took the advantage, while saving ground around the final turn and was outfinished by the top two.
QUICKSILVER raced within striking distance, steadied entering the final turn, blocked, weaved through traffic, made a mild gain, but was no factor. BIG
CANE lacked early speed, drifted out around the first turn, moved up, but was no threat. SUCH sprinted to the front and was finished early. DREWZANO
raced in the middle of the field, came around the second turn four wide and faded. FLAT OUT LOVE raced near the back in the beginning, moved up to
challenged near the leaders and faded.

Footnotes
WEST BANK BABY raced on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, dueling with JADE DORO, put him away and held off a late charging GREEN
MONSTER. GREEN MONSTER pressed the pace, close throughout, rallied down the stretch and needed more ground. JADE D'ORO challenged for the
lead, dueled throughout and was outfinished by the top two. QUEEN OF CARNIVAL lacked early speed, moved up and finished evenly. JUDY'S PRIZE vied
for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, weakened and was no threat late. YOUR MY SUNSHINE raced near the middle of the pack and
lacked a bid. LUCKY QUEEN lacked early speed, raced five wide around the first turn and was never a factor. TWILIGHT GLOW raced within striking
distance and dropped back. CLASSY BIRDETTE broke poorly and was never close.

outfinished for the win, but proved best of rest. HALEYS HEIST bumped at the start, racing within contention, made a late bid and proved third best.
STRONG BEAUTY raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. NANCY'S RESCUE raced evenly near the back, showed late
interest, but was no threat. ITSNOTMYJOB raced on the front end in the beginning, weakened and dropped back after turning for home. MINERTIME
hesitated, then hopped at the start and was never close. WHERES MOM bumped, stumbled at the start and was never a threat.

MICK'S STAR challenged for the lead from the onset, while saving ground, dueled down the final stretch and prevailed for the win. NOMO RON raced within
striking distance, came around the second turn four wide, rallied down the lane and was outfinished for the win. SPEEDY FELLAR vied for the early lead,
racing with MICK'S STAR, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished by the top two. BISTRAYA lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but was
no real threat. DOUBLE STAR raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. GRAND LUWEGEE pressed the pace, raced three wide around
the final turn and weakened. FLYING HONEYPOT raced in the back of the pack in the beginning, passed tired ones and was never close. GOLD BUYER
raced near the back and showed little. RECOUNT raced within contention and stopped.

Footnotes
A THOUSAND REASONS broke sharp, sprinted clear, led throughout and was never challenged. KARATE HOTTIE raced near the back at the beginning,
made a steady gain, coming around the turn on the outside, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SHES OUR FASTEST brushed at the
start, racing near the back, made a steady gain and got up for the show position. SHAHARAZAD brushed at the start, raced in the back of the pack, showed
late interest, but was no factor. LUNAR APPROACH void of early speed and passed tired ones. THE AURELIA FACTOR pressed the early pace, forwardly
placed until late, faded down the home stretch. DRIP BREW raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and was finished early.
I'MNOTSHYI'LLBUY raced within striking distance, dropped back and was no threat late. UNBRIDLED CLASS raced in the middle of the field in the
beginning, quickly dropped back and was outrun.
