Footnotes
WISE TO LISTEN settled toward the rear early inside, moved swiftly sweeping past horses on the far outside around the far turn, outdueled EIGHT AIN'T
ENOUGH through upper stretch and drew off under a mild drive. EIGHT AIN'T ENOUGH tracked the pacesetters in the clear up the backstretch, lodged a
bid three wide coming to the quarter-pole, could not match strides inside WISE TO LISTEN turning for home and ran on clearly second best. DUELLIST
raced between horses in the second flight to the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly for the show. CASTILLETE saved ground in the
middle of the field around the turns, and lacked the needed late response. BRAHE trailed for six furlongs, and made no impact passing tired horses. ONE
MORE DRINK broke through the gate prior to the start, contested the pace inside ALLABOUTTHEBEACH to the far turn, could not cope with the top two
finishers into the stretch and retreated. ALLABOUTTHEBEACH broke a step slow, rushed up three wide to contest the pace going to the first turn, and was
finished after six furlongs. SUGARTOWN KID was three wide on the turns in the second flight, and lugged in while tiring in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MR ATILA broke on top then conceded position to RAY'SWARRIOR, remained forwardly placed and tracked foe through early stages, advanced closer and
raced in striking distance at the quarter pole, prompted to get by RAY'SWARRIOR turning for home, vied for the lead with a furlong left to run then shook
free under pressure and finished clear. DESERT GENERAL was ridden along out of the gate and raced in range five to four wide through the backstretch,
was under a drive midway through the turn, kept under steady pressure and raced five wide into the lane, kept along with response and got up late for place.
RAY'SWARRIOR advanced to the lead shortly after the start, set the pace and continued on top with MR ATILA looming up near the quarter pole, fought
back when challenged by aforementioned foe upper stretch but was no match nearing the final sixteenth then got edged late for place. BLACK PEPPER
hustled up out of the gate but lacked early kick, raced near the rear leaving the backstretch then roused five wide around the turn and gained position,
continued a bid racing wide entering the lane then chased on evenly. TRAPPEZOID hustled along in steady pursuit while not too far off the early pace, failed
to keep pace and weakened around the turn then offered no late run. AREYOUTALKINGTOME was off a step slow at the start and took the inside position
to save ground, continued in the back and urged for response near inside around the turn but failed to move on. KYLE pushed along and showed response
in early stages then faded around the turn.

Footnotes
HARD COUNT took control after the start, rated along unchallenged to the stretch, got one left-handed reminder through the furlong grounds and was in
hand to the finish. BARBIE'S KING was outrun early inside, advanced with a four-wide move around the far turn, and was up outside WINNING FACTOR for
the place. WINNING FACTOR was four wide entering the backstretch, chased after the winner to the stretch, and was nipped for the runner-up spot.
NOBLE NEBRASKAN raced three wide into the far turn, and made little headway. FILM FAN became unsettled tossing his head under restraint on the first
turn, and faded steadily after a half-mile. TREASURE RUN got shuffled back inside SIESTA MOON going into the far turn, then checked while bouncing off
the rail and into that same rival trying to get through near the five-sixteenths, and dropped well back. SIESTA MOON was forwardly placed four wide into the
first turn, bumped with TREASURE RUN near the five-sixteenths, and dropped well back. Run-up unavailable.

Footnotes
MOTIVATED SELLER hustled up away from the gate while vying for the lead with SENORA ROMA, continued to match strides along the inside still
unleashed moving around the turn, shook free in hand entering top stretch then shook the reins and shown the whip, stayed sharp in response despite
setting a swift pace and finished going under a strong hand ride. SENORA ROMA roused forward out of the gate and vied for the early lead racing outside
of MOTIVATED SELLER, continued to battle and raced clear over the next pursuer entering the turn, prompted and coaxed along nearing the quarter pole,
could not maintain equal terms with the winner at the head of the lane, stayed on with response under strong left handed pressure, drifted out wider and
held place. TONAL VISION was reserved in the back along the outside in opening quarter, hustled up around the turn then raced wide under strong left
handed pressure in upper stretch, finished with interest and gained on place. PAID UP raced off the pace and saved ground through early stages, angled off
the inside late backstretch, hustled along around the turn, kept under pressure three to four wide entering top stretch then shifted to the inside, briefly gained
share then flattened and lost position. GILDED LADY raced under steady urging while positioned off the top trio, stayed in pursuit around the turn then kept
under a drive five wide entering the lane and offered no late rally. SHE THROWS HEAT lacked early kick and raced three to four wide near the rear, stayed
under pressure five to six wide in the lane and failed to move into contention. GREY JAZMINE showed response in opening stages then dropped back and
failed to regain a contending position. TOKEN broke on top then raced in steady pursuit for quick top pair while positioned clear over the next pursuer,
continued a steady bid around the turn then tired in the drive. SISTERMISCHIEF raced off the pace and two wide leaving the backstretch, dropped to last
after the opening quarter, moved into the lane four wide and failed to factor.

BY THE SEY SHORE tracked the pace inside for three furlongs, came through between horses to challenge outside CAT LADY STEPH in upper stretch,
dueled with that one through the final furlong and proved narrowly best. CAT LADY STEPH set the pace inside, dug in when BY THE SEY SHORE came
alongside, and battled gamely to the finish. WONDER IN got bumped by SUMMER BEACH at the start, chased outside CAT LADY STEPH to the stretch,
and weakened through the late stages while clear for the show. SUMMER BEACH broke in at the start shutting off DAMIANO and bumping WONDER IN,
was urged three wide into the turn, and could not threaten in an even effort. HIGH RIDER was outsprinted inside. KID FORESTER had the two-path into the
turn and could not reach contention. DAMIANO steadied as SUMMER BEACH came over in front of him at the start, and was outrun three wide.

Footnotes
SPICE IS NICE gained a contending position out of the gate then settled inside of the flight that sat off the pacesetter, picked up the tempo entering the turn,
moved up the inside of STRIKE MAGIC at the three eighths pole then cleared on top mid-way through the turn, shook the reins and widened advantage
turning for home, tapped on the shoulder once near the marker, stayed sharp in response under a strong hand ride and drew off impressively. JEWELED
PRINCESS was allowed to settle in early stages and moved to the inside to save ground, prompted and gain position along the inside around the turn,
switched out a couple paths at the head of the lane, was no match for the dominating winner but continued a solid bid for second best. ETANA backend got
bumped just after the start, remained unhurried and raced off the pace down the backstretch, raced in two path and coaxed around the turn, gained position
then kept on two wide and gained show. RUNAWAY MOM was reserved and raced in the back down the backstretch, continued well off the early pace
entering the turn, prompted and moved into stretch run four wide then quickly angled in a couple paths and improved position. CONGRATSROSY raced four
deep in the flight that sat behind the early pacesetter, hustled up for response and raced in striking range for the lead midway through the turn, chased on
upper stretch then gave way. LOADED raced between foes and tracked the leader three to four wide down the backstretch, prompted and gained close
contention midway through the turn then failed to sustain bid and weakened in the lane. TONED UP bumped with foe at the start, raced widest and off the
pace down the backstretch, came under a ride around the turn then moved into stretch run five wide and failed to move into contention. STRIKE MAGIC
sped to the lead at the start and set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, got headed for the lead by the winner past the three eighths pole then
had nothing left in reserve and retreated. CHAMPAGNE TRAIN raced between foes and tracked the pacesetter then came up empty and dropped back near
the three eighths pole.

BOLD PAYNTER settled in the second flight saving ground early, advanced along the inside after six furlongs, slipped through on the rail to overtake
SMELL OF ROSES with a furlong remaining, lost the advantage to JUSTCALLMENORMAN in deep stretch, then battled back gamely to get the decision.
JUSTCALLMENORMAN stayed in range two wide to the far turn, rallied to a short lead outside BOLD PAYNTER a sixteenth out, but was outgamed to the
wire. MACHIAVELLI advanced angling four wide off the far turn, loomed a threat outside through the furlong grounds but flattened out late. SIR SEAMUS
pursued the pacesetter for six furlongs, lodged a mild bid between horses in upper stretch, but was outkicked. SOLAR had the two-path most of the initial six
furlongs, moved out for the drive and improved position while not a threat. SALTKING saved ground outrun for six furlongs, moved out to the far outside
through the lane and gained only mildly. SMELL OF ROSES set a sharp pace slightly removed from the rail, and was overrun from both sides approaching
the eighth-pole. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY chased after the leaders three wide to the far turn, and gave way. I STAND CORRECTED raced two wide
early, and retreated in the three-path before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
WE MISS SUSIE broke out which tightened things up at the start for a pair of rivals, was ridden along and raced in range through early stages, prompted
entering the turn and vied three deep near the five sixteenths pole, battle back with FUJAIRAH turning for home then shook free at head of the lane,
widened advantage while drifting out then secured victory in late stages and finished geared down. FUJAIRAH sped to the lead and continued on top along
the inside through the backstretch, vied for the lead inside a duo mid-way around the turn, could not match strides with winner top stretch but continued a
steady bid and finished clearly second best. KIMURA was forwardly positioned in opening stages then dropped back near the half mile marker, raced five
wide under firm pressure in stretch run and advanced to gain a share. PRINCESS ULELE was forced to check when WE MISS SUSIE broke out at the start
and raced near then in the back, showed response under a drive along the rail around the turn, advanced position up the inside in upper stretch then
flattened in late stages. AUNT NADINE steadied at the start and raced in the back then angled to the inside and quickly moved up closer while a bit keen
and steadied slightly near the half mile marker, remained in steady pursuit off the top trio around the turn, pushed on three to four wide in stretch run and
had no late kick. MANDAMUS was forwardly placed just off the leader through early stages, let out a notch and advanced two wide to challenge Fujairah for
the lead, took on the added challenge of the winner just after and vied between foes midway through the turn, could not move on for the lead at the quarter
pole then steadily faded.

NEW YORK'S FINEST dueled inside KRSTO SKY for three furlongs, spurted clear after straightening away for the drive, and drew off under pressure.
KRSTO SKYE contested the pace outside to the top of the lane, could not match strides from there, but ran on clearly best of the others. NO WAY NEVER
(IRE) saved ground throughout, could not gain through the stretch but held for the show. BLUE CHIP PROSPECT chased three wide to the turn, and lacked
the needed late response. SLEEPING GIANT bumped with SALAMBO at the start, steadied between NO WAY NEVER and BLUE CHIP PROSPECT losing
considerable position on the turn, and could not recover. MISTER MAESTRO was outrun three wide. SALAMBO bumped with SLEEPING GIANT and
checked at the start, went wrong in upper stretch and was pulled up, and had to be euthanized.

Footnotes
UNHOLY ALLIANCE gained a contending position out of the gate and settled nicely racing a path outside of BELLA CIAO, tracked the top two leaders
through early stages then let out a notch three wide moving around the turn, advanced to take over the lead from GRAY OWL at the furlong marker, stayed
sharp in response while confidently handled and finished ridden out. BOUJIE GIRL was forwardly placed and tracked the leader racing in striking range,
launched a two wide bid for command around the turn, could not reach the lead but remained in steady pursuit under a drive into the lane, switched out a
path wider near the furlong marker, sustained a steady bid and gained place. BELLA CIAO settled nicely along the inside and tracked the top two leaders,
prompted two wide around the turn then shifted out wider for the drive, kept on with response under steady pressure and prevailed for a share. GRAY OWL
took the lead at the start and continued on top with BOUJIE GIRL not far behind, held firm and kept foes at bay around the turn then got collared by
UNHOLY ALLIANCE near the furlong marker and steadily weakened. FEEDBACK stumbled at the start and dropped to last, moved by a rival and allowed to
settle in early stages never too far off the early pace, angled inside to save ground late backstretch then tipped out and hustled up midway through the turn,
was under a drive five wide top stretch and never got in gear. HELPING LISA D raced in the back and settled off the early pace, hustled up along the
outside around the turn then roused six wide top stretch but failed to kick on.

Footnotes
TRICKY MAGICIAN hugged the rail under a stout hold early, continued inside around the far turn just off the leaders, slipped through on the rail to challenge
VEGAS KITTEN turning for home, and drove clear through the final furlong. VEGAS KITTEN broke to the lead, rated along showing the way slightly off the
inside, dueled outside TRICKY MAGICIAN through the furlong grounds, yielded in deep stretch but remained clear of the rest. VOLUBILE saved ground on
the turns, moved out in the stretch and rallied mildly. BYE BYE MAN broke slowly, raced well back two wide on the turns, and improved on the rail without
menacing. PREACHER POWER prompted the pace outside, bid three wide on the far turn, and weakened through the drive. MYSTICAL MOON tugged
along in traffic around the first turn, remained hard to handle under restraint up the backstretch, shifted out four wide approaching the stretch and was empty
when roused. BURN THE BOATS raced three to four wide throughout, and lacked a solid response. WAR FEATHER was stacked five wide coming off the
first turn, dropped back to trail through the middle stages and made no impact. POSITIVE PHIL pressed the pace between horses, and tired after six
furlongs.
