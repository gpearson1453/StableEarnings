Footnotes
SHUGS CHARLIE pressed the pace of SAYWARD while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin with a furlong
to run and drew off with complete authority. LATENITE SLEWZY raced unhurried early, advanced six-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in
the drive but finished well to gain the place. EMILY WHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished willingly in
the drive. CHARY RIDE was off a step slow, settled off the leaders from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. JEDI
JENNIE raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. SAYWARD set a pressured pace from off the rail for a half and
weakened. GOOD FOR NOW lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further mid-stretch and was not a factor. RED CLOUD
EXPRESS chased the leaders from the inside, weakened after the opening quarter and was eased through the lane. DIXIE JEN showed no early speed,
dropped far back and was eased.

Footnotes
REBEL LEADER was away in good order then hustled along to open a clear margin before going a quarter, raced off the rail while setting the pace,
responded when challenged into the lane and narrowly held. MISTY B CANYON settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in
with a furlong to run and was gaining late to just missed. TWENTYFOUR K CAT chased the leaders while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive and
finished willingly. JAZZONFRIDAY was off a step slow, raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, reached the winner into the lane
and gave way through the final furlong. BABY LETS ROCK raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch
and finished evenly late. DOUBLE STORM chased the leaders from the inside and gradually gave way. SNUGGLES N HUGS chased the leaders from
between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. CARRY ON DIXIE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. LITTLE LORETTA showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

FETED pressed the early pace, went three wide into the turn, met the bid of SUPPER ACCORD in early stretch, shook clear from that rival, opened up and
held for the win. CLASSIC GENT was unhurried early, circled eight wide into the second turn, was gaining late and finished second best. SUPER ACCORD
raced in mid pack early, went four wide into the second turn, made a bid on the winner, couldn't sustain and flattened out. MINER'S NOTION was void of
any early speed, went five wide into the second turn, angled in and offered no late rally. I AM READY AGAIN was outrun early, went six wide into the
second turn and never fired. NETELA was allowed to settle early, went seven wide into the second turn and was empty late. REAL HEAT set a pressured
early pace, raced off the rail into the home turn and weakened. VICTORY LANE stalked the early pace, raced along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
THE GREAT DOME stalked the pace of S. O. S. SCHILLER while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and quickly drew off.
MOSTLY CLOUDY settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. LAST BEST WEST was bumped at
the start then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to gain on the winner
late. RUNAWAY REGENT raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and lacked the needed late
response. COMMANCHERO SPRING lagged early, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with
some late run. YES ITSA STAR was bumped at the break, lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace.
MY OLE BUD was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. S. O. S. SCHILLER sprinted clear before going a
quarter and weakened through the final furlong. QUAD broke sharply to press the pace from the inside and weakened after going three-eighths. KING
