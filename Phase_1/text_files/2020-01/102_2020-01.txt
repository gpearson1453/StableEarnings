the win. JOHNNYSJOURNEY pressed the pace, dueled for the lead until late, couldn't keep up with the top two. SPEEDACTUS stumbled at the start, racing
near the back, showed late interest, but was no factor. AND YET ANOTHER raced in the middle of the pack, came around the first turn four wide, made a
bid and hung. VICTORY BIND pressed the early pace, saved ground and faded. KING BAYOU went to the front, moved to the inside and tired. THIRTYSIX

Footnotes
CHARMIN DIXIE broke poorly, racing in the back, moved up near the middle of the pack, made a stretch bid, took the lead deep in the lane and held on for
the win. A J'S GRAND raced within striking distance, came around both turns on the outside, rallied down the stretch and needed more ground. CUCKOO
KENIA sprinted to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, led throughout and was outfinished by the top two. MISS WEKATI challenged for the early lead,
forwardly placed throughout and lacked a finish. D'WILDCAT INDIAN lacked early speed, racing near the back, moved up and finished evenly. SEE
WHAT'S WHAT was an early factor, racing behind CUCKOO KENIA and MISS WEKATI, forwardly placed until turning for home, fading down the home
stretch. MEMORY MAGIC vied near the front end in the early part, dropped back and raced evenly late. GRACE OF DAVID raced near the middle of the
field and was finished early. PITCHER void of early speed and showed little. SEATTLE BREW trailed the field and was outrun.

WILDABOUT AUDREY shuffled back at the start, racing in the rear, came around both turns on the outside, dueled down the stretch with
SHE'SAHOLYROLLER and prevailed for the win. SHE'SAHOLYROLLER challenged for the lead, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane and
was outfinished. LOUISIANA SPECIAL went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, was outfinished by the top two, but held on for third. RUN NOW
ESTELLA raced within contention, made a late bid and couldn't get by LOUISIANA SPECIAL for show. LONE STAR DIVA raced within striking distance,
weakened and finished evenly. STORIED TRIP raced near the back, drifted out around the first turn, steadied and was never a threat. ZOLA raced in the
back of the pack and showed little. MADELYN'S MOMENT void of early speed and was outrun. MATT'S PRIDE was an early factor and retreated.

the final turn five wide, rallied down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. CHARLIE GULCH vied for the early lead, dueling with
JACK'S KISS, forwardly placed and lacked a late kick. MCLEAN steadied early, getting in tight quarters, racing from the back, moved up six wide around the
final turn, drifted out entering the stretch, made a mild bid, but was no factor. HEZANOTHERCORREDOR raced near the back in the beginning, came
around the first turn five wide, made a bid and weakened. AMBASSADOR HOUSE broke in, raced in the middle of the field and finished evenly on the rail.
MR. E EDWARDS pinched back at the start, quickly moved up and pressed the pace, before dropping back. D J'S FINALE raced within contention and
quickly retreated to the rear. GEAUX DUBAI raced within striking distance, was finished early and dropped to the rear.
