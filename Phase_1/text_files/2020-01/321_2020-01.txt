clear from that rivals and edged clear for the win. EXOTIC BEAUTY was unhurried early, advanced six wide into the second turn, was closing late and
finished second best. SWEETNORTHERN ROSE was taken back early, circled seven wide through the second turn, was gaining late and needed more
ground. SCHUYLER WARRIOR set a clear early pace, raced off the rail, angled out in early stretch and faded. PROUD CAT stalked the early pace from the
inside, angled out and was empty late. SKINNIE LOVE was allowed to settle early, went three wide into the second turn and flattened out. OUR SWEET
LEGACY was reserved off the pace, went five wide into the second turn and offered no late rally. HUNKA BULL stumbled at the start, lost the rider and was

Footnotes
HERZEN broke sharply to press the pace from between foes, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied with ROLL ON CURLIN into the
sixteenth marker and quickly drew off. ROLL ON CURLIN settled off the leaders early, offered a bid nearing the three-eighths marker, vied with the winner
but could not match strides with that rival through the final sixteenth. DYRDEK was off slow, raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the turn,
angled in with a furlong to run and finished with good interest. MT. TAYLOR raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out
into the stretch and lacked the needed late response. CEBOLLA was off a step slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. INDY MOON was forwardly placed from off the rail and gradually weakened. GRAND PRAIRIE showed brief speed and weakened. OIL COLONY set
a pressured pace from off the rail for three furlongs and weakened. SAZERAC REMEDY was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the turn and did not
reach contention.
