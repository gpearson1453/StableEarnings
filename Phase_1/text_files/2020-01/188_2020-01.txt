Footnotes
RYDERROO bore out on the turn, closed once straightened, got up late and drew clear. YUMA THURMAN set the pace with a clear lead, led to deep
stretch, was outclosed and all out for place. LIEUTENANT MARGIE chased the pace, was carried out on the turn, finished well, was gaining ground and got
up for show. FELDY was carried out on the turn, closed once straightened and gained late. FLYIN ARTIE was steadied at the start, raced inside, checked
into the turn, angled out, bid to loom a threat and hung late. PANSHIR stumbled at the start to be off slowly and trailed the field under mild urging. Following
a stewards' inquiry, RYDERROO was disqualified and placed fourth for causing interference on the turn.

Footnotes
CHECK AND RAISE was unhurried early, raced inside, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide, closed willingly and got up in the final strides. BIG
IMPRESSION bumped at the start, raced mid pack outside, rallied around the turn, bid willingly and was outnodded to just miss. LOGAN'S LEOPARD
stalked the pace, assumed command three across on the turn, drew off for a long lead, led to the final strides and yielded despite steady left handed urging.
SWEET IDI saved ground while never far off the pace, slipped through along the rail on the turn, offered a mild bid only and hung. DOMENICO raced in the
back, went seven wide entering the stretch and improved position. VIRGHAZI broke slowly and bumped at the start and lacked a bid in a wide trip.
SNALLYGASTER dueled to the second turn, tired and stopped. STORMIN G A dueled to the second turn, tired, stopped, was eased late and walked off.

THIN LINE broke awkwardly, set a pressured pace and held on gamely. SAMURAI JACK pressed the pace, bid between horses on the turn to challenge,
went willingly to the wire, couldn't gain on the winner and settled for place. TOTALITY raced close to the pace outside, challenged three across on the turn
and didn't have enough late despite strong urging. WELLDIDYOUGETIT raced mid pack in an even effort and did not threaten. IRON BELL improved
position in an even effort. POSTMAN failed to contend, was eased late and walked off. THE GREAT LEBOWSKI passed a tiring rival. FORTUNE OF WAR
(GB) bobbled a bit at the start, held a good position inside to the turn, tired and stopped.

KEYSON set the pace, drew off on the turn and held well under urging. MYSTIC REALITY angled out at the top of the stretch, closed steadily and was
gaining late. TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO bumped at the start, bid, hung and held for show. BLOW MY MIND broke slowly, raced in the back, closed inside
and didn't have enough late. DAKATI went eight wide entering the stretch, failed to rally and did not threaten. BOILER PLATE bumped at the start, went
nine wide at the top of the stretch, lacked a bid and was not a threat. HERE COMES BARNEY pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.

NOBLE EGYPTIAN set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended his lead to win handily. SALTINI was unhurried early, saved ground, advanced between
horses along the backstretch, bid seven wide, closed under mild urging and was no match for the winner. PARKING PERMIT was void of early speed,
angled out on the second turn, went eleven wide at the top of the stretch and was along for show while no threat to the top two. ADORNED stalked the pace
while racing inside, had nothing left for the drive and faded through the stretch. CENTRAL PARK showed speed to the second turn and flattened out.
MIDNIGHT REVERIE raced in close outside, went eight wide at the top of the stretch, had nothing left and gave way. CATS SURFIN was outrun.

SUMMERLAND pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled for the lead, inched clear near the sixteenth pole and held under steady
urging. TEE EM EYE lagged early, raced outside, went seven wide at the top of the stretch and finished well to get up for place. FOGGIA set a pressured
pace, responded when challenged to duel, faltered near the sixteenth pole and was all out for show. DREAMY GAL was never far off the pace, went five
wide at the top of the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FIFTYSHADESOGRAYCE pressed the pace while racing between horses to the turn, stopped
and was not urged late. BULLICIOUS pressed the pace while racing inside, stopped into the turn and was not urged thereafter.

Footnotes
YANKEE PRIDE set the pace, drew off leaving the turn and held safely under mild urging. PEACH TIME was unhurried early, advanced to the far turn,
angled in, closed along the rail and got up for second while no threat to the top two. TANAGER saved ground, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide and
finished well to earn show. TO HONORANDCHERISH raced close to the pace, bid and came up empty. IS IT GOLD chased the pace while racing inside,
tired on the turn and gave way. SHIMMERING DREAM came in at the start, raced close to the pace, went five wide leaving the turn, tired and gave way.
OCEAN DREAM broke slowly and was pinched back at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. INTERNATIONAL DIVA (IRE) broke out, raced in
the back and was not a factor.
