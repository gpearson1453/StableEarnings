and held for show. MI BOUCHON raced mid pack outside, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. THE GREY SAINT lunged at the start and was

GATTAIA set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended her lead while ridden out. CONSTANT CRAVING raced close to the pace inside, shifted out for
the drive, had the rider lose his whip, lacked a rally and was no match for the winner. DONTTELLMYHUSBAND advanced to the second turn, bid inside,
hung and held safely for show. SOPHIE T raced mid pack in a wide trip and did not threaten. SHOELESS JACKSON showed speed to the second turn,
flattened out and dropped back. SHARP MIND was off slowly and stumbled at the start, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. CHARMING JILLY B broke
out, was checked on the first turn, saved ground and failed to contend.

TRAFFICISKILLINGME set a pressured pace past the eighth pole, inched clear and just lasted. MY MIA MYAH saved ground to the second turn, angled
out, bid five wide, closed steadily, was gaining late and got up for place. TIRUNESH pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, fell back
a bit past the eighth pole, continued willingly to the wire and was caught for second. WILLING TO BURN raced mid pack outside, had nothing left for the
drive and faded. LADY ELSA raced close to the pace, went six wide leaving the turn, tired and gave way. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR broke slowly and trailed
the field. Hand timed.

TANNERS PRIDE went seven wide entering the stretch, closed willingly, got up late and won going away. MR. LOVEJOY set a pressured pace, drew off
leaving the turn for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. LODE THE GOLD raced inside, angled out on the turn, swung ten wide leaving the
turn, closed well and got up for show. CIRCUS RIDE bumped at the start, pressed the pace while racing outside, fell back on the turn and hung in the lane.
MITCH AND JOHN E came out after the start, bumped and was steadied, went widest in the drive and offered a mild bid to narrow the gap. HOT RODIN
was not a factor. SIX NINETY ONE bumped at the start and again soon thereafter, showed speed to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
RATE FOR ME was never far off the pace, rallied on the turn, assumed command in the upper stretch, inched away and held well in an uneven course.
CHOCOLATEICECREAM raced mid pack, advanced to the turn, bid five wide, angled out for the drive, closed steadily and was gaining ground. BUCKYS
PICK was never far back, went five wide leaving the turn, lacked the needed late response and settled for show. MR. SHOOK raced three across to the
backstretch, vied to the turn, drew clear, weakened and faded from contention. THETRAILERGUY raced between horses to the backstretch, vied to the
second turn, tired and faded. PLAYOFF BOUND raced outside in an even effort. HALLIE'S HERO was not a threat. STORMY SAILOR broke slowly and
failed to contend. OUT OF PATIENCE vied inside, was through after a half, stopped and was not urged late. PACIORETTY was through early, stopped and
not urged late.
