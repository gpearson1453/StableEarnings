Footnotes
UNKISS ME pressured the pace three wide while dueling at mostly even terms, then dug in determinedly to inch ahead through later yards. GINGER IN
DISGUISE broke in to make contact with Mandarina then set a pressured pace, dueled with the advantage in the three path of the turn and dug in gamely
through deep stretch before yielding; grudgingly. ZIRCON ZLOTY pressured the pace two deep while between horses and raced close into the turn, but,
dropped back midway through the turn, angled to the three path entering the stretch and finished evenly. DOCUMENTED gave chase and rounded the turn
off the rail then flattened stride later yards. MRS POOCHIE pressured the early pace inside, but checked from tight quarters at the rail in the vicinity of the
five sixteenths pole and faded through the turn. DAISY'S STORM gave chase, raced in the four path of the turn and showed little in the lane. MANDARINA
was bumped at the break, gave chase outside and raced wide on the turn.

Footnotes
EDDY DIRT stalked the pace then bid approaching the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms two deep rounding the far turn then dug in under
determined handling to inch ahead of Banishment, and was able to hold off STEP OUT DANCING, who raced four wide the opening turn then settled off the
pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, dug in through the lane to take second the final yards and was gaining on the
winner. BANISHMENT rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure past the three eighths pole, dueled at even terms nearest the rail on the far turn
and remained a factor to deep stretch before flattening stride. OUR CHARITABLE saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the
rail on the far turn and finished evenly. JACKY'S MAN raced well off the early pace while saving ground, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three path and finished evenly. JUST A LIL LUKEY settled off the pace then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn in the three path but flattened stride into the lane. MY HALO gave way after a half mile.

ELLIE'S LIL MAN saved ground off the pace then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail then dug in through the lane to get
up under the wire. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail,
was steadily encouraged through the lane, though, nipped at the wire. OWEN'S WAY saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little more. CASTLE BOUND saved ground off the pace, bid only mildly through the backstretch then rounded
the far turn at the rail. JAXBRADENRISHI stalked the pace three wide, gave chase from the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.
ACCESS TO DENIS settled back about the three path and never factored. HE'S SPECIAL stalked the pace two deep, faded readily down the backstretch
and was not asked further.

TEL AVIV drew clear past the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure midway on the turn and was steadily handled through the lane.
WIGGLE IT JIGGLEIT gave chase to take second in the four path toward the head of the lane and was gaining late on the winner. GLOTONASA steadied at
the start and raced well back, started a bid in the four path leaving the turn and was along for third mid-stretch. RUMERS ARE TRUE chased the pace
inside but raced boxed at the rail most of the turn, recovered stride leaving the turn, though, showed little more. ONE DAY MORE chased the pace and
raced at the rail rounding the turn then weakened. I AM ON MY WAY gave chase then weakened in the five and six paths of the turn. CHEROKEE FIRE
gave chase through the backstretch, faded on the turn and was pulled up later yards.

Footnotes
SUDDEN BREEZE saved ground the first turn then bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path, angled to the outside past the
eighth pole and closed steadily to get up later yards. THE BETTER ONE settled back about the three path the first turn then raced outside into the
backstretch, started a bid approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn six wide, lugged in while taking a brief slim lead later yards but was outfinished
approaching the wire. CANDYFORACAUSE settled off the pace about the three path the first turn then eased outward entering the backstretch, bid nearing
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn five wide, lugged in under a right hand drive then steadied nearing the wire. TAMAQUA stalked the pace two
deep while between horses, challenged leaving the three eighths pole, dueled with the edge off the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch and
flattened out later yards. OCASIONALY CLASSY saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was
shut off later yards. BOLD VALOR stalked the early pace three wide, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn but was
shut off in the upper stretch and couldn't recover stride. ZEHAVI rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, ceded the nod
past the five sixteenths then remained close at the rail through the far turn before weakening. As a result of a stewards inquiry, Candyforacause was
disqualified to sixth place for causing interference through the stretch.

Footnotes
IM A TRICKY ONE saved ground well off the pace the opening turn then bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved and rounded the far turn
about the four path then dug in to even terms mid-stretch and took the nod under the wire. COURTLY KITTY settled off the pace in the four path the first
turn then started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in range of the lead in the three path of the far turn, dueled to even terms mid-stretch but
missed the nod under the wire. SWEET TWEET stalked the pace from the three and four paths then closed to the lead approaching the quarter pole,
contested the advantage at the rail rounding the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but was headed later yards and flattened
stride nearing the wire. HOLIDAY MAGICIAN broke a step slow then settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened stride the final sixteenth. HANALEI SUNSET stalked the pace toward the inside, picked up the chase
past the three eighths pole but flattened stride at the rail rounding the far turn. BRASS MAGNOLIA raced well off the pace in the four path the first turn then
toward the outside into the backstretch, came through the far turn in the five path and showed little more. FLYING PHILLIP'S took the lead nearing the three
quarter pole and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, gave up the nod toward the quarter then faded at the rail
rounding the far turn. EARNED THE SHOT rounded the opening turn in the five and six paths, raced outside into the backstretch and never factored.
CANDY CASTLE stalked the early pace from the three path, picked up the chase at the three eighths pole but faded past the five sixteenths. PIKI PIKI GIRL
was never a factor.
