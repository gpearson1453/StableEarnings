Footnotes
GAVINS LITTLE SIS settled on the outside, was urged along while three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then drifted in a bit
before being corrected by the rider, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed well to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady
handling. HERO OF GOLD settled off the pace, was taken in hand briefly outside the half-mile pole, advanced leaving the backstretch, chased three then
four wide on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken while able to get the place. STEALING SUNSHINE dropped
back against the rail early, settled towards the rear, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to get up for the show.
MARQUEE MOMENT broke out at the start, showed good speed from the outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was headed in upper stretch,
fought on well into the final sixteenth then weakened and was caught for the show. ANGEL'S CUT broke a half-step slow then bumped with a foe, was taken
up while keen behind horses midway down the backstretch, leveled out again near the half-mile pole, checked behind horses into the turn, came under
urging while saving ground on that bend, chased along the rail under a drive into the final furlong, had a tight but available opening along the rail but couldn't
muster enough energy to go through and weakened. CAN'T COUNT THAT moved up on the outside, advanced leaving the backstretch, engaged the leader
in the three path on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. SWINGING BRIDGE broke a step slow then bumped with a rival, settled
at the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path on the turn and was no factor. CANT HIDE MY CRAZY showed speed then tracked the pace,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, was urged along while two then three wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
CABO'S RUMOR settled toward the rear racing off the inside, advanced two to three wide between rivals past the five-sixteenths pole, shifted five wide
leaving the turn under a full drive with aim on the leaders, took over just past the furlong marker and kicked clear while kept to task. PHAT AND FAST
switched outside rivals trailing the field, was coaxed along up the backstretch and moved up outside foes four wide into the turn, came out of that bend six
deep, followed the winner home to be second best. BOLD ZARB was forwardly-placed chasing inside but off the rail early, continued inside a rival behind
the leading pair but in the two path on the turn coming three wide out of that bend and having lost some ground on the top pair but kept on in the late stages
to capture show honors. BOSTON REPO pressed the pace from outside, applied further pressure heading into the turn going four then three wide on that
bend, put to urging and bid nearing the furlong marker but could not sustain the effort thereafter. ADRENALINE set the pace early racing well removed from
the rail, faced increasing outside pressure into the turn going in the three path into that bend before looking back and shifting in one path midway on that
bend, was in contention to upper stretch then gave way. I B REVOLUTIONERY stalked outside a rival, went approximately three wide through the turn
coming four wide past the quarter pole and losing ground, came up empty thereafter. JALEN HURTS had brief speed chasing inside, dropped back still on
or just off the rail and inside foes into the turn, came out for the stretch run and lugged in while fading.

GUITAR TRIBUTE was brushed lightly at the break, encouraged along racing inside a rival but off the rail up the backstretch, raced in the two path on the
turn then moved out another path turning for home, lugged out under a left-handed whip in upper stretch then shifted in a path in mid- to-late stretch, was
under an all-out drive and surged late to get up near the wire. BRITTS A CLOSER settled in the clear mid-pack up the backstretch, advanced two to three
wide between foes late on the turn coming out four wide into upper stretch, was carried out a bit in mid-stretch taking the lead at that juncture, led late but
was just nailed. ONE MORE JUMP tracked the leader from inside early, switched outside that rival past the three-eighths going about two to three wide on
the turn and making a bid in upper stretch, drifted out a bit in mid-stretch then weakened late. ROUX GA ROUX sped clear dictating terms racing in the two
path into the turn, shifted in a bit early on that bend, was challenged in upper stretch and steadily weakened. LILRASCALMAN broke inwardly lightly
brushing a rival, raced inside a foe on or just off the rail into and through much of the turn, advanced a bid leaving that bend shifting four wide into upper
stretch but ran evenly thereafter. CURIOUS CASE was very reluctant to load and fractious behind the gate, urged along outside a rival early, went three to
four wide through the turn coming five wide past the quarter pole, came up empty in the stretch. COACH O'SHEA broke a bit awkwardly, was
forwardly-positioned chasing the leaders from outside into the turn, went five to six wide on that bend while steadily dropping back and faded. TENSAS
GOLD was reluctant to load, raced inside but just off the rail leaving the turn and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
COBRA CASABLANCA showed good speed from the outside, angled in while going to the front, moved clear outside the seven-sixteenths, dictated terms
along the rail on the turn, was challenged by SWEET PRAYERS while in the two path into the stretch, shook off that foe outside the furlong marker,
switched back to her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. SAVVY ALLY settled towards the front, raced inside to the two
path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, drifted out under a left-handed whip inside the three-sixteenths, was switched to a right-handed whip near
the eighth-pole, chased the winner in the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. STELLAR AGENT settled in the back half of the field, raced inside
to the two path on the turn, angled out outside the furlong marker, angled further out outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good energy for the show.
SISTER NOVA settled on the outside, was urged along while five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
UNFADING BEAUTY bumped with a rival at the start, raced well back in the field, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SAINT
KENNEDY raced near the back of the field, went around the turn in the two path, turned into the stretch under a drive and was no factor. SWEET PRAYERS
showed speed then chased the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, made a bid in the three path into the stretch, lost touch with the winner outside the
furlong marker and tired. ALTERED DREAM moved in while settling off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
failed to rally. MALIBU DAWN bumped with foes on both sides at the start and was off a bit slow, settled at the rear of the field, went three to four wide on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. UNDERESTIMATE bumped with a rival at the start,
settled near the middle of the field, raced towards the inside on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and came up empty. BONNET raced towards the
front of the field, was urged three to four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated. INSANE MACLEAN settled off the pace, dropped

Footnotes
KNIGHT'S CROSS settled mid-pack just off the leaders racing along the inside, came out a path late on the first turn, tracked in behind rivals from off the rail
up the backstretch, tipped out early on the far turn coming four wide by the five-sixteenths and was thereupon encouraged along, passed outside rivals into
upper stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and with moment and steady handling edged clear. ORO DE TEJANO was caught five then four wide racing
outside rivals through the first turn, settled mid-pack still outside foes up the backstretch before making a swift move four deep into the far turn, took a
narrow lead by the three-eighths and shifted in a path then a further path midway and late on that bend while quickly drawing clear, was challenged and
overtaken a sixteenth out but clearly second best. AFLEET ROGER was taken back and shifted in heading into the first turn going two wide into that bend
then shifting in to the rail midway settling last but one for the run up the backstretch, began to advance coming two wide into the far turn then shifting out
three then four deep early on that bend to pass outside rivals, came back in a path or two turning for home and having improved position, angled out near
mid-stretch but could not kick on. DREAM HALO exchanged a light bump at the break, pressed the pace outside a foe three then two wide on the first turn,
continued in contention into the far turn going mostly two wide on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. ESKENDEREYAS DREAM was outpaced early
racing inside, switched off the rail leaving the first turn, continued to trail up the backstretch racing well removed from the rail and given some
encouragement, went in the two to three path on the far turn swinging four wide into the stretch and passed rivals. JACKFRUIT raced three wide between
foes into the first turn then lost position dropping back and shifting in a path on that bend, continued to drop back and was urged along two to three wide on
the far turn coming out a further path leaving that bend, failed to rally. NICE OF ME was forwardly-placed but caught about four wide into the first turn,
tracked the leaders outside then between foes up the backstretch, went three wide on the far turn, dropped back and came up empty. FREDONIAN
exchanged a light bump at the start, set the pace racing off the rail inside rivals into the first turn, continued to face pressure up the backstretch, was nearer
the rail into the far turn but overtaken entering that bend, dropped back and faded.
