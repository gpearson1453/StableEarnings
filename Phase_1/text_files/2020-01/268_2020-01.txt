Footnotes
FLYING CURLIN broke out at the start and was corrected, raced forwardly placed just off the inside early on, tucked inside half a mile from home and lost
position through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, rallied tipping out a path a furlong from home, collared
the leader nearing the sixteenth marker and inched clear to the finish kept to task. FAST BREAK broke out at the start brushing SPICE ROAD, raced four
wide down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked to the two path into the turn and advanced along the inside of the leader, came under coaxing nearing
the quarter pole and took over command spinning just off the inside for home, got roused straightened away, dug in under a drive and was collared a
sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors. SPICE ROAD brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking outwards, chased five then four
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cornered five wide into upper stretch and kept on for the show honors. DANCERS FOR TOKEN bumped after
the start by STEP TO THE BANK, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn advancing into contention under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent to just inside the eighth pole, weakened in the late
stages. STEP TO THE BANK established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got headed
for the front and went three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. TRI SAINT LORENZO three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. CONQUISTADOR tossed his head and got away a length slow, then got forced to
steady off the heels of rivals when losing his lane and conceded an additional two lengths, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn, got placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LETMETAKETHISCALL off to a sharp beginning, cemented itself to the top in short order, cut over towards the inside, eventually settling in path two, was
rated along on an open lead, went into the stretch, was in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths pole before getting asked for more, responded, drifted out a few
paths in the last eighth but remained comfortably in the clear. MIGHT BE pursued the winner from the three path, came under a drive spinning into the lane,
gained a little on the errant top one late en route to place honors. TIMELY TRADITION tracked LETMETAKETHISCALL from along the inside route, saw the
pilot resort to stronger handling approaching the end of the bend, chipped away at the deficit in the final furlong, missed out on second. FIRST FOREVER
was caught leaning with its initial step, got going and took up the chase from the two path, was worked into path five from upper to midstretch, made no
headway. OFFLEE IRISH rode the rail until the quarter pole, fanned out into path five after entering the stretch, lacked the needed response. WORLD RIOT
underwent a two wide trip into the lane, never made her presence felt. MAZMANIA three wide onto the turn, was sent out into path four exiting it, gave way.

Footnotes
WINNING DRIVE bumped at the start by MALIBU ACTION, chased two to three wide from near the rear, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths
and advanced through the turn into contention nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, came
in under an off sided stick and a near side rein to the rail just inside the eighth pole just safely clear of a pair of rivals and edged away to the finish to prevail.
BRIMSTONE just off the inside in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained on hold in behind rivals until able to cut the
corner inside the leader into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in under a drive and paused briefly as the top one came inwards directly in
front inside the eighth pole, altered out a path at the sixteenth marker and ran on to secure the place honors coming out late to the finish.
TOOHOTTOEVENSPEAK five to six wide in pursuit, advanced through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths when latching on WINNING
DRIVE from the outside, spun five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. BLINDED VISION showed the way in hand
from the two path under some pressure from MALIBU ACTION to the outside, tucked closer to the inside through the turn, came under increasing pressure
now from a pair and got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home under assault from a flanking quintet, succumbed the front
straightened away, then weakened in the late stages. MALIBU ACTION hustled from the gate, prompted the pace three then two wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. MASSEY HALL prompted the pace four then three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, went four wide for home and folded. FIFTY EIGHT O G chased five then four wide coming under brief light coaxing near the three-eighths,

Footnotes
APPLETINI put to some light hand urging springing from the gate established the top in short order, cut over towards the inside route, showed the way on a
loosely-contested lead, drew out during the setting of the second split even with the tempo not having picked up, got turned loose entering the stretch, saw
the runner up chop away at the deficit in a steadfast manner, held on well enough late to preserve the decision. PRINCESS IN CHARGE stalked the
pacesetter from the two path, fell back during the run around the bend, came under a drive approaching the quarter pole, tipped into the three path at the
head of the stretch, closed in on the one to catch, came up short. APPRECIATE underwent a two wide pursuit on the turn, swung into the lane getting
roused, got outfinished. ORBILICIOUS cut over to the inside after the start, had no rally off the ground-saving journey that followed. DAZZLING SPEED
three wide entering the turn, shifted out four wide exiting it, backed away. ROSES FROM BEN took up residence at the back of the pack after the start,
travelled three wide on the turn, was worked into path five from upper to midlane, made no headway.

QUICK ENTRY vied two to three wide inside a pair down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun
just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive under threat from a quartet, got headed by a pair a sixteenth from home, dug in and came again gamely to
split those foes and get up just before the finish. DESERT LIGHTS broke in at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying into contention a furlong out, ran on fighting on to the
finish to be heads apart for command a sixteenth out and was along to secure the place honors on the wire. ELIOS MILOS five then four wide in pursuit
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking
narrow and brief command under a drive a sixteenth out, then ran on while in hand through the final seventy yards to be along for the show honors. CALL
THE CAT broke out a step bumping ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA then got bumped by that rival due to pressure outside from AIR ON FIRE, chased along the
inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position to procure the last major share. AIR ON FIRE broke
in at the start bumping ROCKIN JOE into ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA and in turn CALL THE CAT, chased five then four wide, remained patiently handled until
set down spinning five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. FLEET WARRIOR vied between foes from the four path down the
backstretch and then the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the
late stages. ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA got bumped at the start by CALL THE CAT who broke out a step, then got bumped by ROCKIN JOE due to pressure
from AIR ON FIRE and in turn returned the favor bumping CALL THE CAT, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. ROCKIN JO got bumped at the start by AIR ON FIRE and in turn bumped ARI'S NAUGHTY LUCA into
CALL THE CAT, chased just off the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, cornered just off the inside for home and tired. FLAT RATE vied from the five
path down the backstretch outside a pair before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, went four wide into
upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PIEDI BIANCHI broke in line with FAIR REGIS, was allowed to drop back into a stalking role, kept watch on the front runners towards the three path on the
bend, got cued up for the drive home, tipped one path wider after losing the third one to FAIR REGIS at the furlong grounds, began to chip away at the
deficit, struck the front in the final seventy yards and edged away. HONEY I'M GOOD shook off light contact with BRIDEWOOD CAT to assume the front
end, got spotted at a slight distance from off the rail, showed the way, feeling pressure from the aforementioned rival, was called upon for more as the half
was being rattled off, staved off the challenger only to have fresher ones arrive on the scene, relinquished well inside the sixteenth marker, then dug in
gamely to preserve the place. FAIR REGIS shifted closer to the rail by the conclusion of the backstretch, drafted behind the second place finisher during the
run around the bend, waited for options coming up to the quarter pole, stepped into the lane, picked it up and out-raced the winner for path three, narrowed
in, fell short of snagging away second. BRIDLEWOOD CAT went on to prompt HONEY I'M GOOD two to three wide after making light contact with that
opponent in the shadow of the starting gate, got roused spinning into the stretch, weakened in the last eighth after being rebuffed. TANYA'S GEM departed
the backstretch approximately four wide, came up empty when asked to pick it midway on the turn, moved into the lane and backed away. POSSE NEEDED
remained stationed along the rail after the field had been sent off and running, was sighted being hand urged on the turn, stepped into the lane and lacked a
response.

drive in command and inched away to the finish kept to task. PANTHERA ONCA dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to her outside,

secure the place honors. MISS MARISSA three to four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
kept on for the show honors. WIGGLE AND JIGGLE three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled three to four wide at
the head of the stretch and weakened. WICKED AMBER five then four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, went two to three wide into

three wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch
and tired. BAY JEWEL broke a beat slow, then lost her lane to the aforementioned foe, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,

Footnotes
HUDSON OVERPASS got hooked up a tussle with GRATTO SWING right from the get-go, took part in it primarily from the two path, vanquished the
nemesis approaching the end of the bend, arrived at the three-sixteenths pole and was given his cue, by now in the three path, just as the second place
finisher was bearing down hard to the outside, saw a duel between them get ignited, shifted over to the rail a sixteenth later, with IMPLIED VOLATILITY
following suit by altering course closer to the inside himself, dug in gamely to fend off the challenger. IMPLIED VOLATILITY away without apparent mishap,
secured a prominent position, kept watch from the three path on the fighting front runners a short distance up ahead on the turn, flashed interest after the
half had been completed, angled four wide into the lane being roused, narrowed in, enough so as to hitch up to the winner with a furlong to go, battled
onward with willingness, moved inward a couple of paths a sixteenth down the road, keeping the mount as close as possible to the top one, forged on but
wound up denied. TALESPIN took up the chase three wide on the turn, got sent out into the six path from upper to midstretch, becoming the widest of all,
mustered up a mild response to grab the show. GRATTO SWING cut over to the inside after the start, vied for the top against the winner all the way to the
quarter pole, stepped into the lane and backed away readily. BLESSED HONOUR took the inside route for over a half, got steered out five wide after
spinning into the stretch, gave way. PIRELLI TOWER got maneuvered over to the middle of the strip after pulling on the bit during the opening phases,
stepped onto the turn from the four path, was then re-directed inward, getting to the rail in time to cut the corner into the lane, had no offering.
