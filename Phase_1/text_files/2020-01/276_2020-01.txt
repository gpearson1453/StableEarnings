Footnotes
ADHERETOME outbroke trouble, set the pace along the inside in hand, continued to show the way into the lane by a narrow margin, long drive, dug in late
to prevail in game fashion. CHERISHED prompted the winner from the two path from the outset, continued to apply pressure turning for home and the
length of the stretch, could not get by, narrowly held the place. LADY GUSTO in a bit tight at the start, in the second flight while saving all the ground,
continued inside, rail bid late, also did not have enough for the winner late, narrowly missed the place. GINNY B in tight at the start, in the second group
while off the inside, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing kick. SHE'S A DIME raced in the second bunch while outside, four wide through the turn,
also came up empty for the drive. WARM BEAUTY saved ground to no avail. ALL FACT lacked a kick while racing three wide. SHES GOT ME GOING
made little impact while racing in the two path. SWISS DOT in tight at the start, outrun.

Footnotes
BETWEEN THE HEDGES with the pace from the start, cleared into the far turn, drew out through the drive while being kept to task. MESANGE lacked early
foot, between horses into the turn, angled out four wide turning for home, rallied on the outside to be clear for the place, n omatch for the winner. DROP
DEAD GORGEOUS settled off the pace and the inside, three wide when moving closer in the turn, lacked a further advance, saved show. UNSWEET TEA
bobbled at the start, raced back, dropped to the inside turn, improved position while not a serious threat. STARVANA forwardly placed, between rivals in the
turn, came up empty when called on for the drive. WITHYOURPERMISSION with the early pace inside, steadied slightly along the rail inside the winner
along the rail, in some traffic late in the bend, faded. MIXTAPE failed to menace while racing three wide. FOXY BOX saved ground while not a factor. TELL
ME BOO BOO was finished early while moving off the inside.

Footnotes
KIM DANDY back early, moved up to the main group inside, continued to save ground through most of the turn, angled out four wide turning for home,
challenged outside the first flight past the furlong marker and kicked clear. COUNCIL RULES forwardly placed from the start, vied three wide through the
turn and into the stretch, continued to challenge midstretch, could no match strides with the winner late, proved second best. CAN'T TOUCH ME prompted
the issue early outside, four wide through the bend, weakened a bit in the drive, saved the show. RANSOMED set or forced the pace along the inside, also

Footnotes
BALADERA void of speed, moved off the inside late in the first turn, three wide into the far bend, circled five wide to the fore turning for home, kicked clear
the final sixteenth. ROAD TEST shuffled back at the start to also race near the back, four wide when improving through the final turn. COWGIRL CALLIE
settled well back off the pace and the inside, remained in hand in the run up the backstretch, four wide into the lane, finished up clear of the others while not
posing a threat to the top two. GRATS ROAD went one paced throughout while racing off the inside. SOARING LIL SASS asked to clear soon after the
start, angled toward the inside when clear, set the pace, began to give way when headed in the final turn. H. M. S. PINAFORE forwardly placed and three
wide in the first turn, advanced and challenged turning for home, had little left the final furlong. MOONLIGHT TRAIN settled off the pace toward the inside,
steadied in some tight quarter far turn, failed to respond in the drive. ICY DAWN flashed brief speed and backed up after a half. LADY CLEOPATRA four
wide when within striking distance in the first turn, gave way. SYRAH lacked speed, four wide in the final turn, stopped in the drive,.

Footnotes
PERFECT HAPPINESS forward and inside, took over late backstretch, drew off through the lane, ridden out. BEACH TIME within striking distance early,
worked way toward the inside turn, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. CATECHISM bobbled slightly start, raced four wide through the
turn when off the pace, staged a mild rally to finish up best of the rest. AUSTIN'S GAL turned in an even effort while racing three wide. ADHWAA raced in
mid pack off the inside, improved slightly while not a serious threat. CLOUDBUSTER void of speed, raced three wide through the turn, displayed some mild,
belated interest. BELLA MISCHIEF went one paced off the inside in lacking a late kick. BUBBLE LINE never menaced. IT'S ALL CASH sluggish in the early
going, angled in turn, always outrun. CARPE AMORINA broke sharp, set the early pace just off the inside, stopped. KISS MO stumbled at the start, moved
up early, began a steady fade before a half.

Footnotes
WELLS BAYOU with pace from start inside, disposed off the other speed turning for home, drew off steadily down the stretch under firm handling.
SOMETHING NATURAL forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground, slipped through behind the winner into the stretch, proved no match
for that one in the drive, clearly second best. LIFE ON THE ROAD in tight early, rank, checked up early, raced back, closer 5w into the lane, could do little
with the top two in the drive, best rest. SELF TAUGHT dueled up front outside the winner, weakened in the drive. BIG MAN BOB off the pace while well
wide first turn, continued outside the be four wide through the second bend, lacked za. PLAY THE WILDCARD forwardly placed while racing three wide, had
little left for the drive. JERSEY CAT TALE off a step slow, got out to be very wide in the first turn, picked off some tiring rivals from well back.
SHACKLEFORD'S JOY in some traffic and mid pack early, steadied onto the backstretch, failed to muster a rally. VIOLATOR stalked the pace five wide in
the first turn, gave way for the drive, jogged in. T C'S IMAGE stopped, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
DESTINY WAY forwardly placed out in the strip, challenged four wide into the turn, vied three wide out, kicked steadily clear in the drive. GRAHAMSTAN
void of speed, made a good gain four out to five wide in the turn, continued willingly to the finish to be up for the place. THE DEVIL'S DADDY settled in mid
pack for a half, set down for the drive while in the two path, outkicked for the place. ROCK CITY ROCKET within striking distance, moved closer in the turn,
chased the winner into the lane, flattened out to lose a couple of positions late. ARKANSAS RED lacked speed, improved position without posing a serious
threat. HESLUCK in mid pack early, fell back in the turn, improved a bit in the drive while also never dangerous. KURTS RAIDER flashed brief speed and
backed up in the turn. R V T THUNDER ROAD off a step slow, remained always back. BACK ROAD OUTLAW lacked early foot, failed to menace. MY
SUGAR TOWN was never involved. OFFICER DONELL broke on top, dueled early off the inside and stopped. MARCO'S DREAM pressed the issue early
from the outside, briefly dueled inside the winner through the turn and also stopped.
