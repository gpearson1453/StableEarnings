set the pace in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner inside the
three-sixteenths, fought on until the near the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to her inside lead at that point and was outfinished while well clear for the place.
CASUAL PLEASURE moved up on the outside, made a bid under urging while three wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened while
able to get the show. DECADENT DIAMOND tracked the pace, was taken up some leaving the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the
turn, was taken up slightly while off heels outside the quarter-pole, spun into the stretch in the two path and came up empty. SHESAROCKSTARTOO broke
out and bumped with a rival, was rated off the pace, moved from three to five wide under urging on the turn, chased into upper stretch and tired.

and failed to rally. MI LIA broke a bit slow then bobbled, raced well back in the field, went three wide early on the turn then dropped to the rail and failed to
threaten. ADINA broke a step slow, drifted out significantly at the rear midway down the backstretch, went five wide early on the turn, was carried six then
seven wide near then seven-sixteenths, dropped back to the six path into the stretch and was no factor. G'S MINE bumped hard with a rival at the start then
was taken up, settled off the pace, was urged along while three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond.
MADAM QUEEN raced off the pace under some urging, was taken up leaving the backstretch, moved from the inside to the two path on the turn and never

Footnotes
BOBBY'S WICKED ONE brushed with HOG CREEK HUSTLE at the start, dropped in while displaying brilliant speed, powered clear while skimming the rail,
turned into upper stretch under his own power, had the jockey take a confident peek behind him inside the furlong marker and drew off without being asked
to win handily. HOG CREEK HUSTLE brushed with BOBBY'S WICKED ONE at the start, was carried in by that foe early, settled in second position,
rounded the turn in the two path, was roused at the five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed whip just after turning into the stretch and lacked the needed
response while just able to get the place. DO SHARE broke out at the start, settled at the rear under some urging, came under stronger encouragement in
the two path on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then came under the whip and failed to rally.

Footnotes
HENDY WOODS exchanged a light bump at the start then shifted in racing along the rail just off the leaders into the first turn, was content to track up the
backstretch position relatively unchanged, came out a path on the far turn to pass a tiring horse then swung four deep leaving that bend, drifted in a bit in
upper stretch, exchanged some contact in late-stretch and surged past to prevail. SKYE SNOW tucked in racing mid-pack into the first turn, saved ground
along the rail through that bend, moved out heading up the backstretch and advanced between foes early on the far turn before shifting back in, came out
nearing mid-stretch for room, exchanged a light bump with the aforementioned then repeated bumps with FINE ONE WON in late stretch while making a bid
between. FINE ONE WON set the pace in the clear racing inside, was still clear into upper stretch when set down for the drive having come out just a tad,
was bumped several times while weakening late. HAPPY THOUGHT exchanged a bump at the start, settled in the back half early racing just off the rail,
edged closer into upper stretch moving out four wide near the three-sixtenths pole, lacked the needed late kick. AUDREY'S TIME was reserved inside at the
back of the field, saved ground through the first turn, came out a path and was in a bit tight between rivals late on the far turn, cleared outside foes in upper
stretch and angled out about six deep near the furlong marker and showed some late effort. KILBARRY LADY was carried five wide into the first turn,
coaxed forward leaving the first turn to stalk the leader three deep up the backstretch, put to urging leaving the far turn but weakened in the lane. TELLER
TO SING was bumped lightly at the break, caught between rivals at the back in the early going, went three wide and was in a bit tight between foes late on
the far turn, shifted in a bit in the stretch and failed to threaten. TAKE CHARGE PATTI made repeated contact inside and out at the start, steadied just
slightly entering the first turn going three wide on that bend in the back half of the field, made up a little ground into the far turn still three wide on that bend,
swung six wide for the stretch run but had no rally in the drive. PLEASANT MO exchanged repeated bumps at the start, was caught three wide at the back
in the early going, continued three then four wide on the far turn swinging five deep into the stretch, angled out two further paths in upper stretch and made
no bid. ALL IN HARMONY stumbled and bumped with the inside rival at the start, chased mid-pack three wide into the first turn and up the backstretch, was
empty in the stretch. NIKKIS KITTEN exchanged a light bump at the start, was getting out into the first turn going in the four path into that bend before
shifting in a path, tracked just off the leaders a few paths off the fence, was in position nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the stretch. FIONA
POWER stalked the pacesetter from about the two path, began to lose ground up the backstretch, shifted in and faded.

BLACKBERRY WINE bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, was well rated while setting the pace off the
inside, raced in the two path on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead in upper stretch, fought back gamely in the final furlong,
regained the lead inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under vigorous urging. DIGITAL was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the
rail early on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, gained in the two path entering the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, led into
the final sixteenth but was outfinished while clear for the place. CHESTERTOWN went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was coaxed
along midway down the backstretch, came under stronger encouragement while two then three wide on the far turn, swerved five wide into the stretch then
drifted in near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. RACE DRIVER broke out then was corrected by the rider,
went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while three wide on the far turn, chased four wide into the stretch and tired.
HEALING went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear of the field, was urged along while inside on the far turn and failed to threaten. STRIKE
APPEAL went four wide on the first turn, settled last but one, was urged along in the two path early on the far turn then moved to four wide and failed to
respond.PER RULING#23873 FROM THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION BLACKBERRY WINE WAS DQD DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST

TWO EMMYS was quickly clear setting the pace from about the two path, dictated terms up the backstretch, dug in under steady handling to hold sway.
LIMNERY tracked the aforementioned inside, chased that one home but could make no headway and was second best. KULIK BEAR tucked in to the two
path racing just off the leaders into the first turn, continued stalking in behind, came out a bit turning for home, finished with good late energy to get show
honors. UNCAPPED stalked the winner three wide in the early going, continued three deep and in range into upper stretch then weakened while needing
more late. SHARP PROSPECT was within range outside rivals three wide in the early going, maintained striking distance to upper stretch then flattened out.
ONAROCK raced inside mid-division early, continued to save ground near but just off the inside on the far turn, came out a bit for the stretch run but failed
to produce a rally. PEACE OF EKATI angled in early, saved ground racing toward the rear, advanced inside foes on the far turn and continued to improve in
the lane. CLEAR VISION was forwardly-placed between foes three wide in the early going, continued off the leaders mid-pack up the backstretch, went two
to three wide on the far turn, came out a bit for the drive but leveled off in the lane and made no sustained bid. ATTORNEY TIM shifted in two to three wide
on the first turn racing toward the back, continued a few paths removed from the rail and was never near enough to threaten. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL went
outside foes three wide in the early going, continued outside three to four wide on the far turn and failed to rally. ANTARCTIC was getting out five deep into
the first turn, took up the chase outside foes with good forward position going three to four wide on the far turn, then weakened in the stretch. MORE THAN
A. P. was rank while fighting the rider's restraint heading to the first turn in behind rivals, saved ground on that bend continuing toward the back half of the
field and inside up the backstretch, moved out a bit for the drive but produced no rally. JAILHOUSE KITTEN was unhurried at the back saving ground
through the first turn, came out a couple paths for the far turn and failed to produce a bid. IOYA AGAIN moved in about two wide into the first turn racing
outside a rival well back, continued four to five wide on the far turn and failed to threaten.

two path on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed fast to get the lead at the
furlong marker then drew clear under strong urging. TRUE FRIEND broke out then was hustled, stalked the pace on the outside, inched closer while three to
four wide on the turn, was asked at the top of the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner while under a drive into the
final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. MISTY DAY was fractious behind the gate then in the gate, came away well, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, spun into the two path entering the stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, dropped back
into the final furlong and weakened while just able to get the show. LUMINAIRE raced just off the pace, dropped back under urging while four then five wide
on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under the whip, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and came up empty. READYFORMYCLOSEUP stumbled
at the start, settled off the pace, was asked leaving the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. LEGAL LIMIT pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and tired. MALIBU

SHAKE SOME ACTION was reluctant to load, broke outwardly but well enough to gain forward position stalking three wide just off the leading group into the
first turn, was encouraged along a little bit going four wide on the far turn, left that bend five deep and within striking distance, moved to the front a furlong
from home and edged clear. AUBURN HILLS was forced in and bumped with a rival at the break then steadied, was keen to go on early fighting rider's
restraint and a bit rank shifting in heading into the first turn, continued two wide just off the leaders into the backstretch, advanced three wide on the far turn
making a bid, was in contention into upper stretch but simply outkicked. DECLARED settled between foes two to three wide in the early going racing
mid-pack, bided his time into the far turn going three then four wide on that bend and asked for run past the five-sixteenths, kept on in the stretch to improve.
SPANISH KINGDOM was forced in a bit and came in of his own after the break, moved forward stalking three wide off the leader, lost some ground three to
four wide on the far turn, came out and appeared to bobble near the quarter pole and ran on evenly thereafter. DIVULGENCE came in just a bit after the
break, set the pace in the clear racing in the two path, was collared late on the far turn, fought to upper stretch then yielded. DEANOS CAPE was under a
hold early racing inside just off the leaders, lost ground into and on the far turn, came out a path or so turning for home, offered no late bid while in behind
runners late. KOKO STAR broke a step slowly and steadied at the start, was well back outside a foe two to three wide early having shifted in from the
outside draw, settled into stride and began to advance outside runners heading to the far turn, went three to four wide on that bend, angled six deep into
upper stretch and ran on. LOKOYA ROAD was just a bit unprepared at the start and a step slow, tucked in and raced inside in the back half to the stretch,
angled out in mid-stretch and improved position. URBANITE tucked in to the two path clear of other runners into the first turn, raced inside foes before
edging clear of those near the five-sixteenths then came out a path, shifted seven deep turning for home and failed tor ally. SKOL CHANT was bumped at
the break, a bit keen to go on inside early, steadied just slightly into the first turn, edged a bit closer up the backstretch going between runners on the far
turn, could not sustain the effort and faded in the stretch. CURLINGTON was forced three to four wide on the first turn racing outside runners mid-pack,
edged a bid closer four to five wide on the far turn, dropped back and faded in the lane. BIGDADDY'SFLYINGHI raced outside foes three wide in the early
going, had to steady on heels past the five-sixteenths and made no bid thereafter. COACH BAHE was forced in and exchanged bumps after the break,
steadied at that juncture and dropped back along the inside, came out and went three wide on the far turn but made no bids.

shook clear inside the furlong marker, extended the advantage under the whip into the final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride while much the
best. EARNER showed speed then was taken in hand when CHRYSTAL SPHERE crossed in front, tracked that foe on the outside, made a bid in the three
path on the turn, took a brief lead just inside the quarter-pole, quickly lost the advantage to the winner, vied with that foe into the final furlong and proved no
match while well clear for the place. CHRYSTAL SPHERE came outward at the start, dropped in while going to the front, set the pace in the two path,
dropped to the inside midway through the turn, lost the lead just inside the quarter-pole, dropped back into the final furlong then switched out and tired while
able to get the show. LUCKY CURLIN came outward at the start and was off a step slow, settled on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, went
five wide on the turn, advanced six wide into the stretch but had nothing left. MAN OF HONOR broke in and hit the gate then was hustled, showed speed on
the inside, was taken up multiple times as CHRYSTAL SPHERE crossed in front from the nine-sixteenths to the half-mile pole, chased inside on the turn,

Footnotes
QUEBEC set the pace just off the rail, went clear on the first turn to dictate terms up the backstretch, shifted nearer the rail on the far turn, continued clear
into upper stretch where put to a drive, was fully extended late and just lasted. DON'T TELL MARGE shifted in and was reserved in the early going racing in
the back half, began to advance inside foes but just off the rail on the far turn, came out three to four wide in upper stretch for room, took aim and rallied but
just missed. STAVE also shifted in heading to the first turn but was more forwardly positioned tracking inside, began to edge closer under encouragement
heading into upper stretch, came out in mid-stretch, bid between runners late but needed more. MAKEALITLEMISCHIEF was forwardly-placed stalking the
winner two to three wide in the early going, continued easily from outside up the backstretch losing some ground on that rival, edged a bit closer into upper
stretch having gone three deep on the second bend but lacked the needed late kick. AREA settled last but one outside a rival into the first turn, eased back
and shifted in leaving that bend, saved ground on the far turn, angled out near the furlong marker and gained mildly. LA SIGNARE (FR) broke outwardly and
a step slowly, trailed along the inside early, switched out and advanced two to three wide on the far turn angling six wide into upper stretch then ran on.
SMART EMMA was getting out a bit lightly brushing an outside rival into the first turn, went three to four wide on that bend just off the leaders, asked for run
four deep outside the five-sixteenths pole but came up empty for the drive. DIVINE QUEEN bobbled just slightly at the stat, was forced out a bit and lightly
brushed four wide into the first turn then eased back and shifted in a bit going two to three wide on that first bend. AVIE'S MINESHAFT went outside foes
mid-pack but caught three wide through the first turn, continued three to four wide on the far turn and was empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
FINITE went around the first turn in the four path, was rated just off the pace on the outside, stalked three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid while
asked at the quarter-pole, took over before the three-sixteenths, fought gamely with two foes into the final furlong then the runner-up in the final sixteenth
and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. URSULA went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, set the pace through sensible fractions, vied
inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought back gamely inside of the winner and
just missed while narrowly able to get the place. TEMPERS RISING went around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back of the field, was roused
while three then four wide on the far turn, came five to six wide into the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth, gained on the top two late and just missed
while able to get the show. PORTRAIT went four wide while under tight restraint on the first turn then was reserved off the pace, advanced four to five wide
on the far turn, made a bid into the stretch, battled outside of the top two into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. HIS GLORY broke out and brushed
with a foe, went three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, went two to three wide on the far turn, made a bid between horses at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired. PASS THE PLATE broke awkwardly and was last away, went three wide on the first
turn, settled off the pace, went four then five wide on the far turn, was roused in the process, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response. SHE CAN'T SING went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, drafted three wide on the far turn, was asked while shifting
four wide coming to the quarter-pole, came under a drive in upper stretch and also lacked the needed response. MAGA SUITE brushed with a foe at the
start, was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail early on the far turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths and came up empty.
