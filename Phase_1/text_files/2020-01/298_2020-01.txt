SPITTIN HAVOC pressed the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide, closed once straightened, got up past the eighth pole and drew
off. DIMERA set a pressured pace past the eighth pole, was outclosed and no match late. BABY GROOT raced in the back, bid inside, lacked a rally and
was along for show, finishing best of the rest. NIZAMDCARCHY stumbled at the start while getting away well, challenged for the lead on the turn, bore out,
fell back and weakened in the drive. THAT DOG WILL HUNT pressed the pace while racing between horses, was checked entering the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
ROLLS ROYCE DEAL saved ground, closed along the rail, was in tight and got up near the sixteenth pole and inched away. JOHN PAUL'S BET raced
between horses to the turn, dueled throughout, came in near the sixteenth pole and was outfinished in a good effort. RUNN'N REBEL raced close to the
pace, angled out and rallied on the turn, closed steadily and gained late. HOWDY KINGKOWBOY dueled for the lead, was impeded and steadied near the
sixteenth pole and dropped back. BLUE JEANS N BEER was never far back and lacked the needed late response. UNINVITED was void of early speed,
went nine wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. BLOWIN SMOKE was outrun in an even effort. THE ROCK ROLLS was hustled along to press
the pace to the turn and gave way. Following a stewards' inquiry, JOHN PAUL'S BET was disqualified and placed fourth for causing interference in late
stretch.

Footnotes
WARRENSDIRTYDANCER raced close to the pace, got through along the rail on the turn, dueled for the lead and drew clear late in a driving finish. Y O L O
CAT dueled to mid stretch, was unable to sustain his bid and held for place. PERFECT SURPRISE pressed the pace while racing outside, challenged four
wide on the turn, fell back entering the stretch, continued willingly to the wire, couldn't gain ground and settled for show. SYNNIN was unhurried early, saved
ground, closed mid track and improved position. AQUAMARINE pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back and finished evenly. WINE N DIVINE raced in
the middle of the pack, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a rally. MISSING GROOM was void of early speed and improved position in a steady effort.
VIRGIL T showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back, bid along the rail on the turn and came up empty. SOLAR HEAT raced in the back, swung
wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. BECOME AN INSIDER was outrun in an even effort. SUM CANDY dueled to the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
TRAPALANDA broke awkwardly, moved up inside to set a pressured pace and drew off past the eighth pole under urging. HARD TO COME HOME was
never far back, bid inside on the turn to loom a threat, hung late and held for place. LOUD N PROUD pressed the pace three across, fell back on the turn,
went evenly late and just lasted for show. BLANK IT lagged early, went widest in the drive, closed well and was outnodded for third. THE COMMON MAN
pressed the pace while racing between horses, dropped back on the turn and finished evenly. REDROCK TRAIL raced outside, swung wide leaving the turn
and lacked a bid. KODIAK KING raced inside, lacked a response and did not threaten. BRICKHOUSE was not a factor.

on the turn and finished well. COZY BAR set a pressured pace, drew clear entering the stretch and faltered late to lose position. KALAKALA pressed the
pace, bid between horses on the turn and weakened in the drive. DESERT BLACK lacked a bid in an outside trip. PRINCE OF PARIS raced in close, bid
five wide on the turn, swung wide and gave way. DARRENATOR was not a factor. DREAM ON FOR SPEED bumped and was crowded at the start, was not
a factor and not urged late.

Footnotes
BROZILIAN (BRZ) was unhurried early, saved ground, rallied around turn, bid five wide and wore down his rivals to get up late. MONUMENTAL SEVEN
was roused on the turn, shifted out, assumed command entering the stretch, drew clear, led to deep stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. ME was
unhurried early, saved ground, bid inside and earned show while no threat to the top two. TOO AWESOME sprinted clear to set the pace to the second turn,
tired and faded through the stretch. IRISH CHARLIE was outrun in an even effort. OUR MONEY CAT settled off the pace, advanced to the second turn, had
nothing left for the drive and dropped back. TRAFFIC STOP was not a factor.
