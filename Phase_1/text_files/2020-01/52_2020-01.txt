Footnotes
WHEN JESUS WALKED hesitated at the break and was away about four lengths last, trailed to the second turn, swung out four wide, rallied when set down
for the drive and closed steadily to be along in time. HOLD ME CLOSE stalked the pace to the second turn, bid three wide to get to terms into the stretch,
dueled to deep stretch but could not stall the winner. INCLUDE EDDY never far back to the half, bid two then three wide to the stretch, tried to rally between
rivals in mid stretch but was denied room, again tried to split foes nearing the sixteenth marker but again had the hole close, had to check both times and
finished evenly. SECRET MANIA attended the pace from the rail to the stretch, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. CALL ME STYLE was outrun to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn, had to circle rivals four then five wide to the stretch then lacked a closing response. CUPID'S VICTORY had good
speed, dueled outside SECRET MANIA for six furlongs then tired.

ZIPPY GROOM was chasing to the turn, raced three wide while closing to the stretch, pushed to the front in mid stretch then held under steady urging.
INTIMIDATE hopped in the air at the break and lost about four lengths, trailed to the turn, swung out four wide for the drive and closed steadily but too late
in a good effort. FAST SALE was outsprinted to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch then could not offer the needed late response. FLY FIRST CLASS
attended the pace outside of TANKER, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. SMOKED TOO MANY was also chasing the leaders, raced three wide to
the stretch but came up empty in the drive. MESA JONES had no speed and saved ground to no avail. TANKER hustled to duel for the lead from the rail to
the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and gave out.

push clear to the line. DOCTRINAIRE stalked the pace to the second turn, bid three then four wide to the stretch, shot clear to mid stretch but was no match
for the winner. A. P. PHAROAH had no speed, settled to the half, bid three wide on the second turn, loomed a factor to mid stretch but lost his punch late
and finished evenly. MULHOLLAND HIGHWAY (IRE) had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch but lacked a closing response.
THATSABADBOY attended the pace inside to the second turn, checked in tight quarters at the five sixteenths, shifted out into the stretch but also did not
rally. AMERICAN FARMER was tracking the pace to the second turn, bid two then three wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. SUCCESSFUL
COMMAND contested the pace outside a rival, was being overtaken on the second turn then clipped AMERICAN FARMER'S heels, bobbled and weakened
in the drive. PENMAN (IRE) settled mid pack to the second turn then saved ground but weakened in the drive. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the
trouble between SUCCESSFUL COMMAND and AMERICAN FARMER on the second turn but failed to alter the results.
