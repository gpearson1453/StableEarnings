Footnotes
OWIN wasn't far back outside early, moved to vie on the turn in the three path outside the early leader and was just up after a stiff drive. FIREINTHEPULPIT
went in the air at the break, was hustled to a clear lead soon after, stayed out from the rail around the turn, responded when challenged but was just
outfinished in a game effort. THE LAST YANNUZZI angled in early on the backstretch while not far back, stayed along the rail around the turn but lacked the
needed closing response. PECOS BILL bumped with SR.'S THRILL leaving the gate, was slow early, was carried wide on the turn then made up ground
late between horses. SR.'S THRILL bumped with PECOS BILL leaving the gate, bore out into that one on the turn and continued evenly through the lane.
PAINTED CLOWN broke in the air then bobbled leaving the gate, steadied early on the backstretch, took to the outside, raced the four path around the turn
then tired. OFFENDER ducked in sharply leaving the gate, came out into the four path on the turn and tired.

Footnotes
DOUBLE CROSSED settled far off the pace in the three path, waited behind horses passing the quarter pole, angled in turning for home and commenced a
rail rally, then drove to the lead passing the sixteenth pole with a good finish. JEALOUS HEART dueled along the inside of GIRL GONE ASTRAY down the
backstretch, was restrained to allow that foe to clear off into the turn, tipped to the three to four path turning for home, bid for the lead and reached in
approaching the furlong pole, but was bested by an oncharging inner rival at the sixteenth pole. GIRL GONE ASTRAY dueled for the lead while in the three
path early on, cleared her inner foe at the five sixteenths pole, but was headed by that foe's rebid approaching the eighth pole and gave way. TIZ
PROMISING RVF rushed the gate right before it opened, then hesitated and came out two lengths behind the field, trailed the field by a distance in the three
path around the turn, then shifted to the six path turning for home and passed tired rivals. SIX PACK GAL chased the dueling leaders in the four path, but
weakened turning for home. MERROW hopped and took a bump in the start, stayed in the three path in midpack, then lacked a rally in upper stretch.
KEWANNE raced in the four to five path in midpack around the turn, and failed to get involved. ELI'S FORTUNE vied along the inside, but failed to keep
pace passing the seven sixteenths pole and faltered around the turn. ALPHARDINI broke outwards and bumped a rival at the start, saved ground in
midpack, but weakened while drifting to the three path at the quarter pole.

RUN AWAY pressed outside the early leader, moved two wide to the front early on the turn, drew out entering the stretch and held under steady urging.
HAY SEEKER edged to a clear lead inside the winner just before a quarter, stayed close to the rail around the turn, and couldn't stay with the winner in the
lane. BIG HOUSE wasn't far back outside early, fell back in the three path between horses on the turn then gained mildly outside through the lane. TO THE
HILT broke in the air, lagged early, circled into the stretch and made up ground too late. GORGEOUS CHARLI had his head turned to the inside as the
doors opened, hit the gate as he threw his head to the outside, broke slowly, made a strong four wide run on the turn then had nothing left for the drive.
NINTH SYMPHONY was slow early, raced two wide into the stretch then made up ground between horses. THERE HE GOES tired inside. PLAINS
WARRIOR bore out on the turn, stopped and was eased up late.

Footnotes
DISCO DEJA VU broke outwards, trailed the field in the four path while still in range of the leaders, swung to the seven path turning for home, commenced a
rally and drove past her rivals to reach the lead at the sixteenth pole, then drew off through the late stages. FAST INTENTIONS raced close to the pace
while five wide and outside of rivals, cruised forward to bid for the lead passing the five sixteenths pole, swept past her inner foes turning for home, drew
clear and shifted inwards, but was bested by DISCO DEJA VU's charging rally at the sixteenth pole. SUNDAY IN L B C stalked the leading duelers from
along the inside, was under a tight hold through the turn, shifted off the fence and into R CHERRY's path at the quarter pole causing that rival to steady,
waited behind the leaders in upper stretch, darted to the four path for clear racing room at the furlong pole, and offered a mild rally. GOLDEN CHANCE
dueled two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with FAST INTENTIONS turning for home, dug in for place in upper stretch, but weakened
passing the furlong marker. FILLY FROM PHILLY dueled along the inside of multiple rivals, but lost the lead turning for home, dug in for place in upper
stretch, but weakened at the furlong pole. R CHERRY was close to the pace two wide, steadied in tight quarters as her inner foe shifted off the fence, then
lacked a rerally through the lane. SOUR MASH bumped an inner rival solidly at the start, prompted the pace four wide and between horses, but weakened
turning for home. STORMY SPELL was reluctant to load, then bumped an outer rival solidly at the start, dueled three wide between horses, but weakened
approaching the quarter pole.

GREAT AGAIN settled outside, was hustled closer outside in the three path on the turn, took over in early stretch and edged clear through the final yards.
RIO ABAJO edged clear from inside horses before a quarter, stayed out from the inside around the turn and gave way grudgingly. MEGA MILLIONS came
out leaving the gate, bumped with GOLDEN SPUN LAD, advanced inside, gave his best along the rail into the stretch then weakened. POCOPSON
STATION was slow early, raced well out into the track around the turn and gained mildly outside. ROLLING PALISADES was slow early, raced the two path
around the turn then bore out under left hand whip through the lane. GOLDEN SPUN LAD was fractious in the gate, came in, hit the inside gate door then
bumped with MEGA MILLONS leaving the gate and was eased up late while outrun. IM FOREVERYOUNG was close up between horses early, moved to
vie between horses in the three path on the turn then stopped in the lane.

FLATTERING RUBY dueled outside of BARITY'S GIRL early on before clearing away from that foe at the five sixteenths pole, widened her advantage at will
through upper stretch, and was ridden out to the wire under a vigorous hand ride. CHARITY STRIPE saved ground from midpack, advanced along the rail
turning for home to achieve place at the furlong pole, but was no match for the winner. GIZMO'S DESTINY trailed early on after a decent break, saved
ground around the bend, then passed outer tired foes in the two path through the lane. SPECIAL RISK hopped at the start, advanced to midpack five wide
and outside of rivals passing the half mile pole, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and passed tired rivals. PARANOIA chased the loose duelers from
the three path while under a drive to keep pace, achieved a bid for place at the furlong pole, but was outfinished by multiple foes for minor rewards. LITTLE
CHERIE faded from midpack around the turn in the two path, and never factored. BANTY'S GIRL dueled inside of the eventual winner early one, but failed
to keep pace with that rival passing the five sixteenths pole, and weakened while drifting to the three path turning for home. LIVIN A DREAM raced far off
the pace four wide, swung to the eight to nine path turning for home, and never got invovled. MILE END was outrun throughout while under a drive between
horses in the three path.

Footnotes
FLASH DRIVE moved to a clear lead before going a furlong, stayed out from the rail around the turn and was under steady urging through the lane. TALLY
MO broke slowly, bumped with FIRE DOWN BELOW while advancing between horses in the chute, gained striking position in the two path before a quarter
but couldn't gain through the lane. MEET CUTE was slow to settle, raced two wide between horses around the turn then made up ground late. OBROTHER
ITSYLVIA lagged early, steadied in tight quarters while trying to rally nearing the stretch, got clear into the lane and gained too late. FIRE DOWN BELOW
bumped with TALLY MO in the chute, advanced inside early, came out from the rail entering the stretch but lacked a closing. KICK KICK HUSTLE wasn't far
back in the three path into the turn, swung wide into the stretch and tired. WATER POLO raced three wide between horses around the turn and failed to
matter. IMPACTFUL raced wide around the turn, stopped in the lane and as eased up.

Footnotes
START CASHIN set the pace while staying in the three path, drifted to the four path at the quarter pole where he met an inside bid from KITTEN STREET,
dueled with that foe through the lane while hanging on his left lead, but drew clear again in the late stages to seal the deal. CAMGO hopped at the start and
was off two lengths behind the field, made up ground in the five path through the turn and sustained hisr advanced through the late stages, but was too late.
KITTEN STREET chased along the inside, made a bid for the lead through a large rail opening turning for home, then dueled for the lead along the inside
through the stretch before giving way in the late stages. MISTER HUMOR prompted the pace from the four path, was floated to the five path as the leader
drifted outwards, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch before getting edged for minor rewards in the late stages. TUFF DUFF stalked in the
three path while, was given a large hole for running room as the leader drifted out at the quarter pole, but lacked the ability to kick through that hole in upper
stretch, and weakened. INSIDER failed to get involved while in the four to six path. MANAHAWKIN trailed along the inside before shifting to the seven path
in upper stretch to pass tired rivals. STREET OFFICER came out at the start, pressed the pace from between horses early on in the four path, but
weakened at the five sixteenths pole. SMOOTH TALK was coaxed to keep pace in midpack in the two path at the half mile pole, but failed to do so and
weakened turning for home before hanging on his left lead through the lane.
