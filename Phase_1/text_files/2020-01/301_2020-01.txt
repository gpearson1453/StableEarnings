Footnotes
DOUBLETURBO raced within striking distance, moved up, four wide around the turn, pulled away down the stretch and proved much the best. PRIMAL
DESTINY raced within contention, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. DERBY DOG vied for the early advantage,
forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. MY FATHER'S EYES bumped at the start, racing in the back, came around the turn five wide,
made a wide rally and finished strong. LUVMEWHENIMGONE raced near the back in the early going, made a mild bid, but was no factor. PAPA'S ISAAC
bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid and hung late. SCOTTY G stumbled and broke in at the start, raced in the back and was
never a threat. REECE'S PRIORITY dueled on the front end and dropped back. RISKEY TRICKEY was an early factor, retreated and was no threat late.
PRETTY SPECIAL void of early speed and showed little.

the turn on the outside, made a late bid and finished willingly. LAST NITE OUT raced within contention, saved ground around the final turn, made a late rail
bid and was outfinished for second. ATLANTIC RULER void of early speed, made a steady gain, but was no factor. JOHNNYSJOURNEY pressed the early
pace, raced close until late, weakened. AND YET ANOTHER lacked early speed, raced four wide around the first turn, made a mild bid and faded. A LITTLE

Footnotes
MEDIAMAKER void of early speed, moved up wide around the final turn, made a rally, four wide and got up in time. SMOOTH CURRENT unhurried in the
early part, racing evenly near the back, made a rally down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. TEN SILVER PINS raced in the middle of the field,
moved up on the rail entering the final turn, took the advantage, drove clear and hung late. FLASHING ANGELBABY lacked early speed, made a late gain
and missed third. BITSY'S CARLOS pressed the early pace, raced three wide around the final turn and weakened. HERMANO T K was an early factor,
raced off the rail around the final turn, faded and finished evenly. PRE HEAT raced within striking distance, came around the first turn four wide and was
finished early. THIRTYEIGHTCALIBER raced in the back and was never close. PAPA'S BIG BOY dueled for the early advantage and dropped back.
CAJUN CASH flashed early speed and stopped.

Footnotes
AGIRLNAMEDSYD unhurried in the early going, moved up around the final turn, rallied down the lane and got up in time. CITY GONE COUNTRY went to
the front, drove clear, saved ground, dueled down the stretch with PADDY O'BELLE, while brushing with her and couldn't hold off AGIRLNAMEDSYD for the
win. PADDY O'BELLE challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, brushed with CITY GONE COUNTRY down the lane and was outfinished
by the top two. ANGEL CAT void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a late gain, but was no factor. U THOUGHT U
GOT ME raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. ROLL ON BABY raced within striking distance and faded. OH MY GOSH BECKY pressed the
early pace and was finished early.
