Footnotes
ROBIN HOOD came away in good order then rated back to last leaving the chute, edged up three deep into the far turn, shifted six wide making headway
into the lane, kept on grinding under right handed rousing through the final sixteenth, wore down SASSY KING and got up. SASSY KING tracked outside a
rival nearing the five eighths pole, moved further out and advanced five wide into the stretch, edged up between foes then took command nearing the eighth
pole, drifted in a bit despite efforts with the left stick, briefly went clear with a sixteenth to go, kept on gamely but just could not resist the winner. MARDEN
prompted the pace outside FLIP, move alongside past the three eighths, dueled on a narrow lead while floated to the four path in upper stretch, kept up the
battle past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. FLIP took command leaving the chute, set the pace towards the inside, was urged along to hold position
past the three eighths, was guided three wide dueling into the lane, straightened to continue the fight to mid stretch then faded. CLOSER LOOK , up close
up while saving ground leaving the five eighths pole,, dropped back some leaving the three eighths, swung out and came up empty.

AWESOME AT RIEDES , in the clear and in range heading to the turn, moved up four wide past the three sixteenths while under left handed pressure,
came out a bit near the sixteenth marker, kept on under steady hand pressure while on his left lead and got up outside rivals in the final jumps. SAVE ME
PAULA , off the pace while saving ground, kept momentum when getting through along the rail leaving mid stretch, made a game bid inside a host of rivals
in deep stretch and got the place. PATAZ spied a contested early pace while three wide, moved to engage VICTORY GIVEN past the five sixteenths,
dueled outside that one entering the lane, gained a narrow advantage past the furlong grounds, was taken on from both sides late and continued with effort
to the line. RIGGED ELECTION , three wide gathering steam mid turn, took closer order near mid stretch, shifted and kept trying between rivals. VICTORY
GIVEN disputed the pace outside PLAYGROUND and held a short lead past the half mile marker, was joined from his outside mid way on the turn, came off
the rail soon into the lane, remained a forward presence fighting it out past the eighth pole then gave way stubbornly between foes. MUCHO MACHO
DANNY , bumped and forced out several paths at the break, regrouped and settled back off the pace while off the inside, came five to six wide for the drive
and closed steadily. IRISHTOWN bore out at the break and bothered MUCHO MACHO DANNY, corrected and was taken to rate, edged up off the rail past
the five sixteenths, awaited room into the lane, angled out, lacked room near the sixteenth marker then altered out late. PLAYGROUND dueled early along
the rail, chased the leaders two wide into the stretch then faded.

Footnotes
BELMONT RIDE , eased out to the four path leaving the turn, advanced between horses and was up at the wire. SHADOW BOXER , nicely rated back
entering the turn, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, gained the lead in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. BARON OF BLUEGRASS
circled the turn, drifted to the six path turning for home and rallied outside. TICKER TAPE PARADE circled the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch,
loomed in mid stretch and flattened out. LACROSTIX prompted the pace two wide around the turn, bid for the lead entering the stretch and weakened late.
ALL CLEAR lacked speed, failed to menace and passed tired horses late. TAPITONTHESIDE hugged the inner rail on the far turn and failed to rally.
PATRIOTIC QUEST weakened. BELMONTE raced in the two path on the turn while outrun. HARGUS sped to the early lead, angled in mid way down the
backstretch, set a pressured pace along the rail, faltered in mid stretch and was eased late.

OCEANOGRAPHER prompted the pace while saving some ground, bid under a ride and to the inside of BIG CITY BLUES mid turn, gained a short lead
dueling into the stretch, wandered outward in the final furlong but stayed willingly and held down the place. A TRUE GENTLEMAN was steadied soon after
the break, settled off the inside, commenced a run mid turn, angled about seven wide and closed steadily through the final three sixteenths. SIR DOUGLAS
, unhurried early while outside rivals, angled wider and moved up six wide past the three sixteenths, chased then flattened out. KIERLAND lagged off the
pace and off the inside, came six wide for the drive, had belated action but did not pose a threat. BIG CITY BLUES took over early, set the pace off the rail,
was joined from his inside mid turn, dueled into the stretch, stayed on to about mid stretch then faded. MAKE THE RULES eased back a bit near the five
eighths marker, raced well back around the turn, saved ground into and through the lane but failed to menace. KING OF ALL MEDIA rushed up towards the
rail near the three quarter pole, dropped back mid turn, angled out and failed to recover. SUPER BUDDY pursued four wide to upper stretch and weakened.
FRENCH'S QUEST , off the pace, angled five to six wide and failed to threaten. IWISHIWASPECIAL stalked three wide, angled out into the lane and gave
way.

Footnotes
MAE SAI PRINCESS saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch, gained the lead inside MARY'S JEWEL in mid stretch and
drove clear. MARY'S JEWEL set the pace near the rail around the turn, moved to the two path turning for home and was out finished. HEAVENLY HATTIE
lacked speed, swung to the far outside in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. GO AMANDA circled the turn, was four deep entering the stretch and
weakened. SHOTDOWNINFLAMES prompted the pace outside MARY'S JEWEL and gave way. DATA PRINCESS dropped back.

Footnotes
LION LORD set a pressured pace towards the inside, moved away under coaxing heading to the half mile marker, opened up under solid hand
encouragement in mid stretch then cruised home the final seventy yards while switching to his left lead. AWESOME D J dropped off the early pace, saved
ground into the lane, remained there through the drive, kept on willingly and nabbed the place in the final jump. THURMAN MERMAN forced the pace
outside the winner, had that one get away after a half mile, gave willing pursuit past the furlong grounds but just could not last for second. JACK STRAIGHT
angled out early, chased a contested pace while three wide, shifted out a bit wider for the drive but came up empty. FLY E DUBAI , off the pace, raced three
to four wide in upper stretch but failed to rally.
