Footnotes
BAYLEAF dueled outside for the lead, took over nearing the quarter pole, responded when roused and drew clear under urging. TARALLUCCI chased
outside in the early stages, moved up four wide on the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch and came up second best. DON'TTOUCHMYSTUFF tracked
along the inside, chased between rivals passing the quarter pole and raced evenly in the stretch. GOLD RUSH KIZZIE chased outside, lacked a rally and
weakened. WROTE TO A DIVA raced off the pace inside and did not factor. DRIVER'S LICENSE dueled inside for command, chased the winner and faded.
MOVE IT MISSY raced two wide off the pace and was outrun.

Footnotes
ALLIUM didn't break sharply then was steered to the rail, dueled for the early lead then was eased back on the final turn, rallied widest into stretch, took the
lead leaving furlong grounds. SUPPORT OUR CAUSE dueled between foes and then was left with the rail after a half, angled out and split rivals in early
stretch, loomed, held on gamely. TALKING POINT was a bit rank racing into first turn, rallied three wide on the far turn, challenged near stretch, took the
lead briefly and weakened slightly. LEGENDARY JACK raced wide throughout, dropped back entering the stretch but continued willingly to the wire.
BRADSHAW, three wide early, was left with the rail on final turn, remained a factor to the sixteenth pole, faded and then was eased up a few strides from
the finish and it probably cost him fourth place monies. PROUDMIAMICITIZEN, in a bit tight racing into the first turn, raced wide and tired. DE PUNTA A
PUNTA saved ground and showed little.

Footnotes
INCITE dueled three wide, shook loose leaving the turn, drifted out a bit, was straightened away and was fully extended to deep stretch. HIBACHI, between
rivals early, then was left with the rail, drifted out through stretch and was no match for winner. INACEPTABLE split rivals on the turn and passed faders.
WAR OF THE NORTH came out and bumped PIGGYBANK leaving the gate, was three and two wide early, drifted out and tired. PIGGYBANK, bumped
leaving the gate, raced two wide early, moved out and gave way. ELITE MISSION raced wide and failed to be a serious threat. SOMETHING PENTO broke
slowly, saved ground and showed little. SMART PROSPECT swung out wide and failed to menace. GAUCHO, very wide, was never a threat. VROOM
VROOM VRIO was also very wide and no factor. PROTA, well placed between foes, gave way leaving the turn. HAY LAD, inside prompting the pace, was
finished early.

GRAVES ISLAND got position inside after another lengthy gate load, steadied briefly near five eighths pole, took the lead leaving far turn, opened a long
lead with a furlong to run and continued to widen, winning with speed to spare. GRIT'N'GRIND wide while outrun, gained place. DEVINE DENTAL set the
early pace in three path, allowed winner to rally inside to take the lead and then faded through the stretch. DROSSELMAGIC steadied between foes leaving
the chute, gave way after a half. THESE BLUES stumbled badly leaving the gate losing all chance. CLEAR PROSPERITY, four wide and just off the pace,
stopped.

JAMES, dug in gamely and edged away for the win, driving. RUN FOR JAMES set the pace, showed the way into the far turn, dueled between rivals
passing the quarter pole, was brushed at the top of the lane, dug in gamely in the stretch drive and held on for second. V. I. P. CODE stalked close up two
wide, bid three wide midway on the far turn, was outkicked, then rallied late outside and just missed for second. QUALITY ASSET raced four wide early,
settled off the pace, between rivals, chased the leaders on the far turn and finished evenly. REFUSEING raced off the pace, went four wide on the far turn
and lacked a rally. SPRING EMPEROR raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. NILEATOR was fractious in the gate, chased between rivals,

STAR SIGN inside second flight, fell back in traffic on the far turn, moved out entering the stretch, closed strongly under pressure and won going away.
FLAT OUT FLYING, outrun early saving ground, swung out racing into stretch and finished full of run. WILL'S PIONEER, who needed a shoe repair in the
paddock, angled to rail after an alert start, set the pace inside, drew off suddenly near stretch and cruised past the furlong pole with a clear lead, began to
shorten stride in deep stretch and faded. CAUSE OF ACTION, between second flight, lacked a rally. ZOOMER, very wide and just off pace, came up empty.
ACED, reluctant to load, was three wide in second flight then tired. POST TIME WAS DELAYED SIX MINUTES.
