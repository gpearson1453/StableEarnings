Footnotes
RORAIMA DOS took command at once, moved two wide to a clear lead into the turn, remained out from the rail into the stretch and held under urging.
ALLISON K bobbled while breaking slowly, lagged early, made a run along the rail into the stretch then steadily bore out under left hand whip. SHACKLE
ME GOOD wasn't far back along the rail into the turn, fell back, began to bore out approaching the stretch and tired. WOLFBLADE advanced early between
rivals, raced three wide around the turn then stopped in the lane. JERILYN ROCKS raced four wide with the pace into the turn then faded. NANO LINK was
sent early between rivals to press outside the winner, fell back quickly entering the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
STONE SCULPTOR broke outwards but prompted the pace three wide, shifted two wide and bid for the lead into the turn, built a clear lead while in hand
approaching the five sixteenths pole, widened his advantage in upper stretch under driving pressure, and was geared down approaching the wire. O K
GAME ON split foes and commenced a three to four wide rally into the turn, was floated to the five path at the quarter pole, then sustained his rally through
deep stretch, but was no match for the winner and proved second best. MATA HARRY saved ground from midpack, but was timid to split foes in the two
path at the quarter pole, failed to kick through the same hole in upper stretch, then split those rivals in the late stages for show. FOLES stalked along the
inside, saved ground around the turn, but lacked a kick in upper stretch to threaten, and got outfinished for show. SPOT OF GOLD raced close to the pace
setters in the two path, drifted to the four path approaching the quarter pole, then weakened in the final furlong. SYMBOL AZTECA raced two wide between
horses while far off the pace into the turn, came into the lane in the three path, and never made an impact. TORDITOS HEIST set the pace along the inside
of STONE SCULPTOR down the backstretch, but failed to keep pace with that rival into the turn, the drifted to the three path at the quarter pole and
weakened between horses. SHARK CITY hopped inwards, brushed the gate, and was hand to handle while rank at the start, but was quickly angled outside
of the field, then was outrun while in the five path around the bend and never got involved.

BALHARBOUR MISS took turns on the front end while saving ground, moved clear into the final sixteenth then held. MISS PINK wasn't far back early, was
hustled along the rail on the turn, swung out entering the stretch then closed a gap outside the winner in the final yards. AXE CAPITAL made the early pace,
continued to alternate on the front end while two wide outside the winner and faded late as the rider stood up well before the finish. LIGHT MY PATH raced
two wide between rivals into the turn, swung out entering the stretch, angled to the rail soon after and finished willingly. CIAO LUNA improved position in the
two path on the turn, swung out entering the stretch and continued evenly to the end. STROLL ACTION was slow to settle, raced wide into the turn, circled
into the stretch and gained mildly outside. OUR HONEY BELLE was outrun inside. MISS LAMBORGHINI was hustled outside early, raced the three path
around the turn, ran out wide into the lane and tired. KITTY'S RIGHT was outrun. BARN DUTY broke slowly, was hustled inside early, came out from the rail

Footnotes
HE'S ZIPPIN ON BY pressed the leader from off of his flank, bid for the lead in hand at the seven sixteenths pole simultaneous with multiple outer foes,
outpaced them into the turn and took over passing the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch and held sway under driving pressure. HOLLYWOOD
HANDSOME stalked along the inside into the backstretch before shifting off the rail passing the five furlong pole, made a three wide bid for the lead while
between horses at the seven sixteenths pole, but failed to keep pace with those foes at the three furlong pole, was put to a drive around the bend and kept
on between horses in upper stretch to prove second best. SNOOP stayed in the three to four path around the first turn before, made a four wide bid for the
lead outside of rivals at the seven sixteenths pole, sustained his bid around the turn, but failed to match strides with the eventual winner at the quarter pole,
flattened out in upper stretch, and weakened. PENDRELL MOON saved ground around the first turn, but was put to a drive to gain ground into the far turn,
shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and offered a mild response while drifting a bit outwards. FLASHY BARON was slow into stride and trailed the field
by a distance down the backstretch, was put to a drive into the far turn and offered some late interest in the six path in deep stretch to pass a tired rival.
OVERLEVERAGED set the pace down the backstretch, but was headed by the eventual winner into the far turn, held position to the quarter pole, but
weakened and stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
RANDOM THOUGHTS bumped with TWO RED CENTS leaving the gate, was unhurried early while racing well out from the rail, rallied wide into the stretch,
vied from the outside into the final sixteenth and drove clear late. FOREST PARK wasn't far back in the three path, was urged closer around the final turn,
loomed boldly on the front between horses in midstretch but couldn't stay with the winner. CARGO SHIP was sent to the front soon after the break, angled
in to the two path entering the first turn, remained in command into midstretch then faltered while drifting. CRAZY IDEA was slow early while racing the three
path, swung wide into the stretch and lacked a strong late response. INDIGESTION steadied along the rail for most of the first turn while inside the early
leader, fell back before a half then continued evenly. TWO RED CENTS bumped with the winner leaving the gate, moved to press outside the early leader in
the three path, remained prominent into the final furlong then tired. JOINER steadied briefly nearing the first turn and was finished early.

Footnotes
TEAK established a clear lead early on, rated while in hand around the turn, widened his advantage easily when let out a notch turning for home, then was
put to a drive passing the furlong pole and kept to task while drawing off to the wire. START MEEE saved ground around the turn to bid for place in upper
stretch, edged that position away from an outer foe at the sixteenth pole, but never threatened the leader. MARTINKELLY was close to the leader inside of a
trio of rivals early on, forged place at the five sixteenths pole and vacated the rail, drifted to the three to four path turning for home, but got outfinished for
place by an inner foe in the final furlong. PHARAOH'S CITY trailed the field down the backstretch, shifted to the three path into the turn, and rallied belatedly
past tired horses through the stretch. EASTPORT raced far off the pace, stayed in the two path around the bend, then passed tired foes along the inside
through the lane without making an impact. CACTUS JACK raced in range of the leader four wide outside of a trio of rivals, but weakened passing the
quarter pole and was eased through the late stages. CREATE A WINDSTORM was in range of the leader in two path between horses early on, but failed to
keep pace with those rivals at the seven sixteenths pole, and subsequently weakened. REX'S LEGACY was close to the leader three wide and between
horses early on, but weakened at the five sixteenths pole before being guided outside of the field turning for home to be eased through the lane.

ZITARROSA showed speed outside, moved to vie outside the early leader in the three path before a half then drew clear through the final yards.
WOLFINBARGER hit the inside door leaving the gate, came in, bumped THE RED SHIELD, angled to the rail while not far back on the backstretch, angled
to the outside in early stretch and finished gamely. LOCO LOBO took command at once, stayed out from the rail around the turn and gave way late. BIG
DAVE broke in the air, was unhurried inside, began a run into the stretch then came out between horses in late stretch. MAGICIAN'SCALENDAR wasn't far
back between horses early, advanced two wide on the turn then flattened out. CAPTAIN THUNDER bobbled leaving the gate, lagged inside into the stretch
then made up ground too late. THE RED SHIELD was bumped leaving the gate, was slow to settle in the two path then found best stride too late.

Footnotes
RAG TOP had a slow start due to the assistant starter accounting for two horses in the gate, saved ground while rating far off the pace, commenced her
advance between horses passing the five furlong pole, split foes to loom behind the leaders around the far turn, then split those rivals in upper stretch and
drew off at will. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE saved ground from midpack, shifted to the three path turning for home, quickened approaching the furlong pole,
and rallied to achieve place inside the sixteenth pole. GLAMOROUS THUNDER held a slight advantage over an inner foe into the far turn, drifted to the
three path turning for home allowing for running room for the eventual winner, was no match as that rival blew past in upper stretch, then dug in for place but
lost it in the final sixteenth. DISCREET TATTOO vied along the inside, but was no match for the eventual winner in upper stretch before weakening in the
final furlong. FLASHY SIREN trailed early on, saved ground around the turns, but to no avail. GOLIGHTLY stalked in the two path before edging closer in
the three path into the far turn, but weakened when floated to the four path at the quarter pole, then hung on her left lead through the lane. QUEEN
STINKER stayed in the four path around the first turn, then failed to factor while taking the far turn in the six path,and was eased through the lane. BLEU
MOON TYPHOON weakened in the four path while midpack into the far turn and was through the lane. LUNAR STAR stalked in the three to four path, but
weakened into the far turn and was eased through the lane. MOXIE MOMENTUM was caught five wide around the first turn, but weakened passing the half
mile pole to trail the field into the far turn, and was eased through the lane.
