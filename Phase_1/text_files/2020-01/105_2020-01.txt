DISC JOCKEY bumped with NORTHBROOK at the start, moved to contention four wide midway on the turn, took over approaching the quarter-pole and
drew clear, and was kept to steady pressure. PERFECT REVENGE was outrun for six furlongs, swung four wide into the lane and rallied outside to best the
others. NEVERSTOPDREAMING vied for command three wide early, could not cope with DISC JOCKEY after six furlongs and weakened through the lane.
K W CAPTAIN HOOK stayed in range three wide early, and lacked a closing bid. PLATO stumbled sharply at the start, rushed up along the rail to vie for
command entering the main track, and weakened through the turn. BEYOND GONE contested the pace between horses up the backstretch, and gave way
soon after going a half-mile. NORTHBROOK bumped with DISC JOCKEY at the start, and was finished early inside.

KINGMEISTER settled nicely while forwardly position behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, let out a notch and edged up to put a head in front near
the three eighths pole, widened advantage on top then stayed on with good response three to four wide under firm handling and held late. TELEPHONE
TALKER shifted out in opening stages and settled off the early speed, picked up the pace along the outside around the far turn, was put to a drive five wide
entering top stretch, rallied up to take the position behind the late leader, continued to gain on KINGMEISTER but ran out of time. TONS OF GOLD was
unhurried and raced five wide off the early pace, stayed outside and picked up the tempo moving around the turn, was set down driving at the head of the
lane, continued a steady wide bid and secured share. SUMMER KID got bumped between at the start, raced in range down the backstretch, prompted four
wide and loomed up midway through the turn, continued a bid racing behind the leader with a furlong left to run then gave way in the final sixteenth.
BOURBON WISDOM raced two wide off the early pace, prompted entering the turn then shifted out turning for home, kept under steady urging and gained
position but needed more for late impact. AFRICAN HERITAGE raced in tracking mode off the top two leaders down the backstretch, advanced position and
raced in striking distance midway through the turn, flattened out leaving the turn then offered no late rally. SEE THE PYRAMIDS bumped at the start, angled
in from the outside position and raced in the back two to three wide leaving the backstretch, was set down wide in stretch run and lacked a needed rally.
EMINENT DOMAIN was allowed to settle in opening stages and dropped inside to save ground, remained near the rear, saved ground around the turn ad
failed to move on. POINT DRIVEN broke out and bumped with foe at the start, raced near midpack through early stages, roused for more near three eighths
pole but failed to advance position then faded in the lane. AWESOME PARTY got pushed in a path and bumped at the start, raced off the pace and offered
no rally when called upon in the turn. CIGAR BOX got bumped at the start but was away quickly and established a clear lead out of the chute, continued on
top down the backstretch, got headed by the eventual winner near the three eighths pole and retreated.

Footnotes
VIOLENT CITY dueled inside TAPI FROST for a half-mile, shook clear into the stretch, widened through the furlong grounds struck once left-handed and
was ridden out to the finish. PALM SPRINGS broke a step slow and was hustled up on the rail, had to be eased back lacking clearance behind VIOLENT
CITY shortly before completing a quarter-mile, lost ground struggling to keep pace despite urging on the turn, then came back on late in the two-path to best
the others. TAPI FROST dueled for the lead outside VIOLENT CITY for nearly a half-mile, could not stay with that one into the lane, and weakened late to
give up the place. TOUCHPOINT was well situated off the battling leaders into the turn, could not quicken as needed three wide approaching the lane, and
faded. ALFATEI raced three wide and posed no threat. NILES CHANNEL was no factor four wide on the turn. CHILL HAZE made no impact three wide.
RIVER STONES hit the left side of the gate and was off slowest, and showed little. EPIC WEST was finished early inside.

Footnotes
WICKED SOLUTION moved closer to the inside after the start, settled nicely in early stages and rated just off the second flight, waited for race room
entering the far turn, continued to lack a clear path at the quarter pole, waited patiently then coaxed two wide leaving the turn, kicked in at head of the lane
and ran down LA RUSIA in late stages. LA RUSIA sped to the lead at the start, set the pace down the backstretch with TEACHER DRAMA not far behind,
stayed inside and held firm still unleashed moving around the final turn, was put to a drive upper stretch, kept on with good response but could not hold off
the late challenge from the winner. LOVELY BROWN raced between foes and stalked down the backstretch, launched a bid for command at the quarter
pole, continued a steady four to five wide bid in stretch run and stayed on with response for show. TEACHER DRAMA was forwardly placed in the first turn,
remained up close and prompted the pace down the backstretch, coaxed two wide around the far turn, remained in steady pursuit upper stretch then
flattened in late stages. MIDNIGHT GEM raced outside of a pair of rivals in the flight off the top two leaders through early stages, prompted three to four
wide moving through the final turn, raced five wide under pressure upper stretch and lacked late kick. LADY NOGUEZ settled in early stages while not too
far off the early pace, hustled up four wide at the quarter pole, stayed under steady pressure upper stretch then came in a couple paths and offered no late
rally. LA VENEZOLANA (VEN) raced in the back and saved ground down the backstretch, shifted out and raced under firm handling turning for home and
failed to kick on. LEMONCITA popped open the gate but did not get away, raced in continued and tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch,
failed to advance position when called upon then steadied while fading out of the turn.

CARACARO pressed the pace outside SIR KAHN, took over near the five-sixteenths, and drew off steadily under pressure. SPA CITY separated from the
second flight after a half-mile, was put to a drive rallying in the three-path just inside DON BOURBON late on the turn, brushed with that rival outside the
sixteenth-pole and edged away for the place. DON BOURBON broke in bumping LUXURY SUITE at the start, rallied in tandem outside SPA CITY four wide
on the turn, brushed with that one late and weakened a bit. UNRIGHTEOUS improved position moving off the inside through the middle stages, but made
no late headway. MILITARIST gave chase early inside, but dropped back after a half-mile. SIR KAHN set a pressured pace hounded by the eventual
winner, was no match soon after completing five furlongs, and faltered through the drive. CLIFTON PARK had the two-path on the turn, and dropped far
back after a half. HOLY MUCHACHO hit the left side of the gate and was off slowly, and was outrun inside. BATTALION was finished early. LUXURY
SUITE got bumped by DON BOURBON at the start, raced three wide and retired early.

Footnotes
NY TRAFFIC cleared on top and angled to the inside just after the start, secured inside position and set a pressured pace with GENGHIS not far behind,
repelled bids from challenger's and took a clearer advantage around the turn, was put to a drive at head of the lane, responded sharply and finished going
away. MASTERDAY got bumped just out of the gate, was forwardly placed around the first turn and tracked the pace along the inside down the backstretch,
switched out a path and launched a bid moving through the final turn, was no match for the winner but continued a steady bid and just lasted for place.
SOUNION broke in and bumped with foe at the start, raced in close contention and stalked the top two leaders positioned three wide down the backstretch,
picked up the pace along the outside around the turn, sustained bid in stretch run and captured show. TIZ RYE TIME raced inside and settled off the early
leaders, hustled up leaving the backstretch then was put to a drive along the rail around the far turn, switched out wider for the stretch run, stayed on with
response and got edged out late for share. MOON OVER MIAMI raced six wide entering the first turn, stayed outside and rated off the early pace, raced
seven wide under pressure at head of the lane and lacked the needed response for late impact. GANGLY raced five wide entering the first turn, was allowed
to settle and raced in the back near the inside to the far turn, moved into top stretch eight wide and lacked a needed rally. GENGHIS was forwardly placed in
opening stages and prompted the pace down the backstretch, launched a bid for command upon entering the far turn, failed to reach the winner then
steadily weakened. LURE HIM IN got bumped between foes just out of the gate, settled nicely while rated off the early pace, hustled along to pick up the
tempo past the half mile marker, failed to advance around the far turn then offered no late rally.

Footnotes
MAGIC STAR was unhurried early two wide, sat chilly edging just a bit closer to the front flight after six furlongs, angled five wide off the far turn getting her
cue, and rallied steadily on the far outside to be along in time while switching leads repeatedly. MUNCHKIN MONEY saved ground trailing for six furlongs,
moved off the rail to the two-path nearing the stretch, split horses rallying a sixteenth out and finished gamely inside the winner. ANDINA DEL SUR went
along in the second flight early, was stacked four wide advancing into the far turn, fought her way to a short lead outside rivals through the furlong grounds
but was outkicked to the wire. SWEET BYE AND BYE stayed close early, challenged for command between horses three wide near the quarter-pole, and
fought on to deep stretch before giving way. MAROUBRA (FR) prompted the pace outside PIECE BY PEACE, faded turning for home and was not pressed
late. PIECE BY PEACE set the pace through an even clip for six furlongs, and faltered on the fence leaving the far turn. MALKIA saved ground in range to
the far turn, took a bad step in upper stretch, pulled up in distress just past the finish line and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TUSK followed close behind the battling leaders in the two-path, split horses readily going up to engage GIDU from outside past the quarter-pole, took
control through upper stretch and drew off decisively. GIDU (IRE) pressed GEMONTEER inside under an early hold, disposed of that one around the far
turn but was quickly set upon by TUSK, could not hold that one off turning for home but ran on with good courage to hold second. MARAUD saved ground
to the far turn, swung three wide to loom a threat into the stretch, neglected to change leads and flattened out late. A THREAD OF BLUE tracked the
leaders three wide through a sharp six furlongs, and had no punch through the lane. EXULTING was three wide between horses on the first turn, inched
closer to the leaders after six furlongs, came four wide off the far turn and lacked a solid response. EMPIRE OF WAR hit the left side of the gate coming out,
trailed inside to the far turn, and could not reach contention. SAND DANCER raced four wide much of the way, and made no impact. BIG AGENDA was two
wide early, faded through the far turn in the three-path, and had nothing late. GEMONTEER was hard-used hanging up fast fractions just outside GIDU, and
tired from those early efforts.

Footnotes
SARATOGA COLONEL gained a contending position out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, settled nicely and rated off the clear top trio in
early stages, picked up the pace entering the far turn, prompted two path near the quarter pole and gained position, set sights on KEEP IT UP at the head of
the lane, was set down under strong left handed pressure, seized command past the furlong marker, dug in under strong handling and just lasted over late
gaining PAWNBROKER. PAWNBROKER settled out of the gate and dropped inside to save ground around the first turn, remained settled and saved
ground off the strung out field, switched out a path and raced two wide leaving the backstretch, gained position then shifted out wider for the drive, was
sharp in response under steady pressure, was getting to the winner late but ran out of time. BLUESKY KITTEN raced four wide entering the first turn, was
unhurried and raced three to four wide off the early pace, dropped inside and was under a drive along the rail around the far turn, gained position then
shifted out four to five wide in stretch run, produced a mild kick and nipped foe to take show. KEEP IT UP got bumped steps out of the gate but was away
quickly from the center position, cleared on top and crossed over the inside, continued with a clear advantage down the backstretch and entering stretch
run, appeared tired past upper stretch, got collared for the lead by winner past the furlong marker, continued to weaken and got nipped for show. KING
LEONARDO rated off the clear top trio through early stages, picked up the pace and raced three wide at the three eighths pole, remained in pursuit into
stretch run, raced in two path at the furlong marker then lacked the needed response for late impact. DOCTOR D J was unhurried and raced near the rear
while saving ground to the far turn, prompted to pick up the pace then shifted out five wide for the drive and passed tiring foes. ICONIC raced in the back
and left the backstretch racing two wide, hustled up and raced wide into stretch run and lacked a needed rally. GRAYDAR'S RESOLVE got bumped just out
of the gate, settled along the inside and saved ground down the backstretch, coaxed two wide entering the far turn but failed to kick on. HONEY DONT
stalked the clear leader while clear over the next pursuer, could not advance position around the final turn then dropped back in the lane. FIVES WILD raced
two wide off the early pace and failed to move on when called upon in the final turn. BLAKEY raced off the top pair in early stages then retreated after the
half.
