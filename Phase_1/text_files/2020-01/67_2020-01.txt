Footnotes
SPLIT MY BRITCHES stalked close up bidding three deep in upper stretch rallying up gamely at the wire. SOMETHING SACRED sent hard was worked on
a narrow lead coming under a drive on the turn extending from the inside down the lane being out gamed at the end. KID TEJANO went evenly through the
turn coming five wide down the lane bidding belatedly at the end. BELTON AVE slow early came six wide in upper stretch showing some late interest.
MASTER SLAM pressed the pace through the turn then wore down on the inside the final eighth. THE GOSPEL OF MARK hustled along pressed in on the
turn to upper stretch weakening late. FAMILY JET was always outrun.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE LOVE gave a quick three deep move on the far turn drawing off down the lane as much the best. PORT MARIA stalked the pace being shuffled
back on the far turn, angling five wide in upper stretch coming on to save place. SECRET TRICK tracked the pace giving chase to upper stretch racing
evenly there needing more. SURE SHE'S GRAND away alertly set the pace through the far turn ceding in upper stretch weakening there on the inside.
SPRING CITY GAL slow early played no factor. WICKED LOVE stalked close up through the far turn then wilted in upper stretch. KENNEDIE SKY was
never involved.

DENNY M set a pressured pace saving ground to upper stretch finding more along the rail to kick clear late. IT'S A MANS WORLD pressed the pace to
upper stretch being dispatched by the winner inside the eighth pole holding on weary for place in the two path. DA DUDE slow early came four wide into
upper stretch finding best stride after the fact. CANDY'S REVENGE gave hard hard pursuit to upper stretch drifting in a bit while weakening late. TAPSHOT
hesitated breaking late, trailing through the turn circled six wide in upper stretch giving belated response. SONNYS CIGAR played no factor. SMART
DRUNK was never involved. JUST CHESTER a step slow in mid pack tired the final eighth. SYL THE TOMCAT raced evenly through the turn then gave
way in upper stretch.
