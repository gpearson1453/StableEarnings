Footnotes
SWEET HOME DIXIE settled off the pace and outside rivals, edged up leaving the half mile marker and took measure of a three pronged pace battle,
progressed under asking and bid four deep approaching the stretch, took over soon into the lane, spurted away under stout encouragement in mid stretch
then continued to widen while steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards. CHEVY TO THE LEVY prompted the pace three wide outside a pair of
foes, disputed the issue between runners into the lane, failed to match strides past the three sixteenths but kept on trying and managed to save the place.
BALTIMORE BEAUTY , off the pace while between runners, angled four wide for the drive and had a belated run. FIDUCIARY VALUES angled in early and
tracked the leaders, bid inside foes near the half mile marker, dueled around the turn and into the lane then came up empty in the final furlong.
YESTERDAYSPLAN , off the early pace while saving ground, was under pressure around the turn, angled five wide but lacked a bid. YES MZ ADAH took a
short lead leaving the chute and raced two wide, sparred between rivals around the turn, shifted out giving chase past the quarter pole then weakened late.

NOBLE WAY , perched off the early duel, bid three wide in hand outside GREAT GO GO mid turn, responded when set down soon into the lane and eagerly
opened up under a drive. GOODLUCKJOHNATHAN settled in the clear early on, came under pressure three wide mid turn, shifted five wide into the lane
and continued on willingly to be along for the place. CASPER SLEW angled in early and dropped off the pace, saved ground mid turn, came out for the
drive, made a mild run between foes near the sixteenth marker and gained the show. GREAT GO GO dueled two wide on a short lead, was hooked by the
winner leaving the five sixteenths, shifted out nearing mid stretch and faded. MYSTIC TIMES dueled to the inside of GREAT GO GO, eased back off the
leaders mid turn, angled out and gave way. HOMER J failed to keep pace.

LONG POINT BEACH set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, was challenged in upper stretch then dug in tenaciously to narrowly
prevail. DANCER'S MELODY stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, bid for the lead in upper stretch and finished gamely to just miss. JARA chased
the pace in the two path around the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and passed a tired rival late. WONDER CITY , two wide on the turn, swung to the
four leaving the bend, had aim on the lead in mid stretch then weakened in the drive. BROAD STORM was outrun. LUCKY TRINITY raced along the inner
rail most of the trip and weakened.

SILVER SIDES , brushed at the break, edged up between rivals nearing the turn, eased out and moved menacingly to take aim on the leader approaching
the quarter pole, assumed command in mid stretch and pulled away under steady left handed encouragement. ONE ODD STORY dueled outside a rival
then went clear leaving the three eighths marker, raced two to three wide into the lane, was confronted past the three sixteenths, faded but had enough left
to save the place. HONORABLE PROFIT , taken to rate four wide early, came under pressure mid turn but lacked a solid response. EXPECT TALK chased
off the inside and came up empty. PERSONAL SERVER , brushed at the break, saved ground while well back early, eased out around the turn, swung well
wide for the drive and had a slight response. BROADWAY TROUPER saved ground and failed to meance. SIPIN ON BOARD , towards the inside, failed to
threaten. BEAUTIFUL ESTRELLA disputed the early pace to the inside of ONE ODD STORY, chased from the three eighths to the quarter pole then
faltered. BUDDHA KAI , three to four wide, dropped back.

Footnotes
FACTOR IT IN saved ground around the turn, eased out a bit for the stretch drive, led late and drove clear. CERULEAN SPRINGS lacked speed, angled to
the six path in mid stretch, raced on his left lead and rallied. SMOKIN NITRO , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened late.
CONFESSOR lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. CHARGIN STORM , three wide on the
turn, was fanned to the six path in mid stretch, raced on his left lead and flattened out. SOUND OFF saved ground on the turn and was not a factor.
SARATOGA BOB , steadied at the break, was outrun, angled to the eight path in mid stretch and passed tired foes. MARCO ISLAND , three wide on the
turn, gave way. WORKIN ON A DREAM , a forward factor in the two path on the turn, raced on his left lead in the stretch and gave way. SHOWALTER
chased the pace outside SMOKIN NITRO, drifted wide leaving the turn and faltered.
