MUCHO PROSPECT delayed the start while reluctant to load, was always within striking distance, closed determinedly four wide through the stretch and
was along in time. GIANT BOO BOO unhurried early, closed fast five wide through the stretch and got up for second. ARAZI LIKE MOVE allowed to settle,
finished with good courage three wide. HIDDEN ARTIFACT stalked the pace into the turn, inched closer three wide then leveled off. YO BERBS never far
back, loomed boldly along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. ROSKILDE away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide until deep stretch then
weakened. MADEYE was no factor. YALLHAVEANICEDAY close up early swung wide and lost ground. ALMIGHTY STORM pressed the pace along the
inside into the stretch then flattened out.

Footnotes
ON FIRE sprinted to a daylight lead soon after the start, set all the pace while getting rapid fractions unchallenged and won as much the best under strong
right handed urging. SUPER BEAU unhurried early, rallied determinedly through the stretch and got up for second. COTTONWOOD CANYON allowed to
settle, offered a bid four wide entering the stretch and just missed hanging on for second. WHITE GLADIATOR slow early, swung wide and passed tiring
rivals through deep stretch. ORE PASS was no factor. DONATION was no threat. GIZMO JONES well placed, failed to respond. Z J WINS reared at the
start and was never close. CONGRUITY chased the winner for six furlongs then stopped.

set the pace along the inside until mid stretch then weakened. SEEKING A JEWEL went evenly. LIL COUNTRY GRAD failed to menace. MY PEGGY LOU
failed to respond. HYDRA'S HOPE was outrun. MY LITTLE LILY hopped at the start and was no threat. HIGH CUPPER no factor.

urging. COME ON CALLIE never far back, advanced steadily three wide and got up for second. GLORIOUS FREEDOM with the second flight, finished with
good courage five wide and just missed second. SHEFLEW found her best stride late six wide. SILKY TASSELS trailed into the stretch, swung wide, and
closed a gap late. GOLD ZEPHYR chased the winner three wide and faded in the final stages. CELEBRATEME was no factor. ETHEL EILEEN stalked the
pace from the inside and faded in the final furlong. WAKEETA pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and weakened late. MAMA LELA had speed into
the turn then weakened. ALERT KITTEN was outrun. PURDY BIRDIE had brief speed.
