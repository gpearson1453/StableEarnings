eighths, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, wandered outward a bit and gave way grudgingly. ZIG , sluggish from the gate, was under a ride early, got
fanned six wide into the stretch, straightened and made a mild run. HICKORY MADE , racing without front shoes, sped to the front and made the early pace
in the two path, vied outside SONG OF THE NIGHT entering the turn, gave chased once that one went clear, kept on willingly to about the sixteenth marker
then faded. SOLEA rated inside early on, angled four wide nearing the lane but lacked a solid run. LUCY'S JOURNEY flashed speed three deep, chased

Footnotes
ARTFUL SPLATTER set a pressured pace towards the inside and under rating, shook clear without much effort approaching the stretch, swerved outward
from left handed asking leaving the furlong grounds, was corrected with right handed encouragement and lasted. ANNA'S BANDIT , between rivals early,
raced in range and under coaxing mid turn, gathered momentum while under strong handling past the three sixteenths, altered in under a ride when
ARTFUL SPLATTER swerved leaving mid stretch and finished valiantly to bridge the gap. ENCHANTED GHOST stalked the leaders while three to four
wide, moved up some past the three eighths, was floated out about six wide entering the lane, straightened to advance past mid stretch and kept on
willingly. NO MO LADY angled in early, edged up nearing the three quarter pole, chased around the turn and gave way. LIMITED VIEW prompted the pace
well off the rail, bid to apply more pressure past the half mile marker, wandered outward nearing the lane and tired. There was a stewards' inquiry into the
stretch run as well as objections by the rider and trainer of ANNA'S BANDIT against the winner alleging interference in the stretch, No action was taken.

ALWAYSMINING measured the leader three wide and under a light hold, responded when put to firmer asking soon into the lane, gained command leaving
the three sixteenths, shook clear under left handed rousing past the furlong grounds, drifted in towards the rail and held firm. JOHN JONES stumbled badly
at the break, quickly regrouped and moved up inside to stalk the pace, angled out to be four to five wide soon into the stretch and finished up gamely to cut
back into the margin. CLUBMAN settled in the clear nearing the five eighths, moved up a bit past the three eighths, dropped in towards the rail entering the
lane, eased back out in the final sixteenth and closed steadily. BUSTOFF was nudged clear early, set the pace just off the inside, was under a ride holding
the lead into the lane, dug in when confronted past the quarter pole battled inside the winner past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. BONUS
POINTS , unhurried early, angled out leaving the far turn, moved up four wide past the three eights, angled wider into the lane gave hard chase past the
three sixteenths then went evenly. PRETTY GOOD YEAR lagged off the pace, raced three wide into the stretch but lacked a response.

early, gave chase between foes mid turn, angled out some into the lane and came on willingly through the final sixteenth. ARCH CAT broke a step slow,

Footnotes
BOBBY G tracked the leaders while four wide, bid outside BENINTENDI mid turn, dueled with that one from the head of the lane, forged to a slim lead in
deep stretch and prevailed. BENINTENDI led early under a snug hold then rated back off BEYOND THE VICTORY leaving the three quarter pole, prompted
three wide in hand, moved back to command after a half mile, met the outside challenge of the winner mid turn, dueled on a short advantage to the
sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. OVER SENSUAL saved ground in range early on, was lightly steadied off heels near the five sixteenths, eased
out past mid stretch and kept on willingly. ABSOLVED , between rivals stalking the early pace, was under coaxing to hold position around the turn, shifted in
past the quarter pole and faded. CROUCHELLI , sluggish from the gate, made a wide run into the lane, chased and faded. BEYOND THE VICTORY pulled
his way forward and took command to the inside of BENINTENDI leaving the three quarter pole, set a rated pace, lost the lead after a half, pursued past the
three eighths then gave way.

Footnotes
BUCKED TOOTH accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and was kept to his businees in the drive. ALLTHEWRONGREASONS , bumped
and squeezed back leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and rallied on his left lead. INDIAN GHOST lacked speed, circled horses on the
turn, remained on his left lead in the stretch and rallied. MR. CHESAPEAKECITY well placed in the two path between horses on the turn, lacked the
necessary late effort. ALPHASTEST chased the pace around the turn and gave way. BALTIMORE BLUES bumped with ALLTHEWRONGEASONS leaving
the starting gate, was a forward factor along the rail down the backstretch and gave way. AWESOME BUZZ was not a factor. MEETMEATTHEWIRE was
checked in tight quarters along the rail leaving the backstretch. ONCE MORE EH was outrun.
