Footnotes
MISS SKI was never far away from the leaders, bid inside to mid turn then shifted off the rail for room into the stretch, rallied when set down for the drive
and closed determinedly to best SHAKE IT CALI late. SHAKE IT CALI The latter chased the pace two then three wide to the stretch, rallied to the front in
mid stretch but drifted out, was corrected but could not stall the winner. TORQUAY had no speed, saved ground to the stretch and finished steadily without
threatening
the
top
two.
TRAFFIC
STOPPER
attended
the
pace
two
wide
to
the
stretch,
got
outkicked

and
weakened.
LILPRINCESSPEGASUS chased the leaders early, got outrun on the turn and failed to offer a closing response. MOTHER SUPREME had no speed and
was never a factor. CLUBHOUSE SODA hustled to contest the pace from the rail to the stretch then was tiring, went wrong in mid stretch, was pulled up by
the rider and vanned off. Race timed electronically.

Footnotes
JENPIRESTRIKESBACK chased the leader to the turn, followed that one inside into the stretch, shifted out, rallied and closed steadily to prevail. ACADIA
FLEET set the pace from the rail to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stall the winner but had enough of a cushion to save the place. HIT
IT TWICE was outrun to the turn, bid three wide to the stretch and finished willingly but too late for second. REAL GOOD DEAL also was chasing the pace
early, was forced out to the five path on the turn and came up empty in the drive. BIANCAS MANDATE stalked the pace to the turn, was four wide then had
to take up at the five sixteenths while crowded between rivals and did not recover. PRIEST LAKE pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, got oukicked to
mid stretch and tired. MORNING DOVE also was prompting ACADIA FLEET, drifted out nearing the five sixteenths and crowded BIANCAS MANDATE then
was corrected but gave way.

Footnotes
URBAN DIVA was hustled to attend the pace two wide to the second turn, pushed away to the stretch then held under steady urging. FANTASY GOLF GAL
was settled to the half, bid two wide on the second turn then outfinished the others without threatening the winner. SILVER SCRIPT got outsprinted to the
backstretch, settled to the second turn then saved ground to the stretch but lacked the needed late response. ANGELIN THE HARBOR had no speed,
settled to the second turn then was fanned four wide to the stretch but also failed to rally in the drive. I C FIRE was unhurried to the second turn then saved
ground to no avail. MELLOW OUT lagged for six furlongs and was not a factor. TAHOE BLUE was sent for speed, dueled inside the winner for five furlongs
then tired and stopped in the stretch.

JOYOUS tracked the favorite to the turn, was fanned four wide to the stretch, rallied when set down and wore down THREE KARYOTS to prevail. SITTIN
AND THINKIN chased the pace from the rail to the stretch then finished willingly inside to get second. THREE KARYOTS set the pace while two wide to the
stretch, responded to mid stretch then was tiring and could not save the place. HOPSCOTCHY was hard to place off heels early, raced two wide on the turn
then closed with a stout run late. HI SKOOL SWEETHART was outsprinted to the turn, saved ground to the stretch then lacked the needed late response.
FAIRLY LUCKY was sent for speed and pressed the pace while three wide to the stretch but tired in the final furlong. PRORIKA got outsprinted to the turn,
was fanned four wide to the stretch and also did not rally. APPHIA was in traffic and checked in the early stages, trailed to the stretch and was never a
factor. SARAZONA TWO stalked the pace three wide to the stretch then gave out.
