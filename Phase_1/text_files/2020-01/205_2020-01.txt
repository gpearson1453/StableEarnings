second and was nipped by a hair width. MOONLIGHT MYSTIQUE had no speed, trailed to the second turn then saved ground but was never a threat.

I'M A ROCKETTE was a bit awkward from the gate, trailed to the turn, was two wide then eased out in upper stretch, rallied when set down, caught NO
COVER CHARGE leaving mid stretch and was under steady hand urging to the line. NO COVER CHARGE stalked the pace to the turn, raced two wide to
the stretch, rallied to briefly have the lead in mid stretch but was quickly overtaken by the winner and had to settle for the place. SAY YES SALLY zipped to
the front, set the pace from the rail to the stretch but weakened through the drive. BEAUTIFUL THUNDER was outsprinted to the turn, got pushed out to the
four path to the stretch and lacked a closing response. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN tracked the leader three wide to the stretch then got outrun to mid stretch
and tired.

REV REE broke alertly, set the pace from the rail to the stretch then responded when set down and held determinedly. MISS JOHNNIE hesitated and broke
a bit slow, settled to the second turn, raced two wide between rivals to the stretch then eased out and closed willingly. CHANTE pressed the winner two
wide for six furlongs, responded when set down for the drive but hung in the late stages. IT'S BIG AINE trailed to the second turn, raced three wide then
swung out widest for the drive but lacked the needed late response. PRINCESS RIO tracked the pace to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch but
came up empty in the drive.

MIRROR IMAGE was allowed to settle to the turn, raced two wide to the stretch, responded when set down for the drive and closed steadily to win going
away. MR. DIPLOMAT had no speed, raced two wide to the stretch, shifted out and finished willingly for second without threatening the winner. PRIKATI
pressed the leader three wide to the stretch, got outkicked to mid stretch then finished evenly. HILL CROOME stalked the pace outside of PRIKATI, was
pushed out four wide to the stretch then was also outrun by the favorite to mid stretch and did not rally. FLYNN broke a step slow then hurried up inside
rivals to assume command, dueled from the rail to the stretch, was clear to mid stretch but tired and lost position quickly. OOPPER WALLAH had no speed
and saved ground without being a serious threat.
