Footnotes
SCARLET BOW, forwardly placed outside rivals in the opening stages stalking the pacesetter, pressed that rival racing into the far turn to upper stretch,
shifted inwards once gaining a clear advantage in late stages and made the balance of the pace under energetic handling. SPEEDING STARLET tracked
off the first flight racing a bit off rail in the opening half, saved ground into the far turn, angled three wide in upper stretch and finished with interest to prevail
for the place honors. SHINY SURPRISE, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin for a half, dueled for command into the far
turn, couldn't contain the winner's bid, then altered course outside that foe in the closing stages. PANDA settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the
backstretch and gained some position between foes late. FLASHY PATCH tracked off the first flight three deep to the backstretch, continued outside a rival
through the far turn, was fanned four wide into the lane and steadily faded. PATRIOTIC ENDEAVOR angled to the rail tracking off the second flight to the
backstretch and faded after a half. MADISON BLUES was brief factor between foes prompting, then tracking between rivals but retreated early.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
RICHIES GREAT GIRL broke slowly, tracked the leaders along the inside while pulling her way into contention nearing the turn, briefly awaited an opening
nearing upper stretch, shifted out advancing in close quarters to split rivals entering the lane, quickly took over and steadily widened her margin to the end
under hand urging. LA BELLE DE COURSE, urged to the lead from the outset while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a narow margin to upper
stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. ROSALDA settled last in early stages, angled to the inside, saved ground to the lane and
gained some position in the closing stages. KISSMEONEMORETIME switched outside the pacesetter attending that rival's pace in the opening stages,
prompted that foe through the turn to upper stretch and gave way entering the lane. FLUGEL BINDER tracked off the first flight outside rivals and faded
early.

Footnotes
DIVA DANA broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin to the turn, turned back a rival's challenge racing into upper stretch and
held sway to the end under firm right handed encouragement. BREWEDTOBEPERFECT tracked off the second flight racing off the inside under light rating
in the opening stages, steadily gained striking distance between foes racing into the turn, moved to challenge the pacesetter leaving the quarter mile marker
but proved no match while best of the others. TESSIE'S RED SOX, restless in the gate, angled to the inside in the opening stages tracking just off the
pacesetter, saved ground to upper stretch and weakened late while edging rivals for a share. UPPER CHARLIZE DS tracked just off the second flight four
wide racing to the turn, angled inwards nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance between foes but lacked the needed final response. I'M A
ROCKSTAR switched outside foes early tracking the pacesetter three deep to the turn, continued in that path to upper stretch and faded late. RONNIE was
settled outside foes early, angled to the inside nearing the turn but failed to gain contention. LA GUATEMALTECA, fractious in the gate prior to the start,
broke slowly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SNICKER KICKER came through close quarters at the break to track off the first flight between foes, was prompted to advance three deep entering the turn
to gain terms with the pacesetter, wrested the advantage from that foe in upper stretch and went clear under energetic handling. FLYING BANKROLL was
roused from the break to gain the lead while shifting off the inside, set the pace through the turn to upper stretch but proved no match in the closing stages.
ODESSA GOLD broke outwards brushing the gate while off a step slowly, was bumped by LEVEL SEVENTEEN, then angled to the inside while collecting
himself, saved ground through the turn gaining position, then shifted outside a tiring rival to prevail for a share between foes. COOL RIVER DS was settled
last early, angled to the inside after the opening three sixteenths, gained some momentum shifting off the inside nearing upper stretch, then altered nearer
to the inside racing into the stretch to gain some position in an even effort. WARRIOR SPIRIT made brief pursuit of the leaders racing five wide, then four
wide into the turn and soon faded. BLAME BISHOP, urged inside the pacesetter prompting that foe's pace racing to the turn, gave way into upper stretch.
STERLING JUDGE proved no factor. LEVEL SEVENTEEN broke inwards bumping ODESSA'S GOLD, was righted to track the leaders between foes racing
to the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
GRAY OWL was prompted to gain a forward placing while angling to the rail in the opening stages attending the pace, responded when urged to advance
inside foes midway through the turn, gained a clear advantage racing into upper stretch and steadily widened the margin under firm hand urging. CAUGHT
UP IN YOU, popped open her stall door just before the start, was settled along the inside racing to the turn, shifted off the inside gaining momentum nearing
upper stretch, angled out sharply to race five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to secure the place honors in the closing stages.
SUPER TWENTY FIVE was rated in the opening stages tracking just off the first flight racing in the three path to the turn, shifted out four wide entering the
bend while being prompted to advance but lacked the needed final response. STARSHIP REINA joined the first flight four wide in the opening stages,
shifted inwards pressing the pace three wide between foes on the turn and gave way into upper stretch. CRASHING CONNIE ducked outwards a bit at the
start while breaking slowly, switched out to settled outside a rival in the last flight, was fanned wide racing into upper stretch and had no late response. J'S
INDIAN CHARM, urged between rivals disputing the pace from the outset, gave way midway through the turn while shifting to the inside. MERMAID OF
HONOR, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes, was urged to press the issue to gain a narrow advantage nearing the turn, dueled between
foes on the bend and gave way abruptly into upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHIDOSHI was rated along the inside stalking just off the leaders racing to the far turn, shifted out three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage
entering the lane and went clear under firm handling and some right handed pressure. TACTICAL QUALITY tracked just off the second flight outside a rival
racing to the far turn, was prompted to split foes three deep nearing midstretch to bid inside the winner but proved only second best. MAN UPSTAIRS
tracked just off the eventual winner along the inside under light rating, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out to split foes just off the inside racing into
upper stretch but couldn't match terms with the top pair while edging a rival for a share. ZACAPA RUN hit the gate while ducking outwards at the start, was
quickly righted to gain a forward placing three deep attending the pace, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch, then drifted through the closing
stages while losing momentum. MR WRENCH IT threw his head at the start, was settled outside a rival in the last flight racing to the backstretch, angled out
five wide entering the lane and gained some position while making no real impression. DUKE OF MONROE, forwardly placed between foes attending a
rival's pace, pressed the issue on the far turn to gain a brief lead nearing upper stretch but emptied out abruptly once headed by the winner. MR
CHOCOLATE CHIP, reserved while angling to the inside in the opening stages, failed to seriously menace. JEDI TEMPLE, urged to the lead along the rail,
set the pace on a narrow margin racing to the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
SMOKY BLUES, bumped at the start, switched outside foes early to race four deep as part of the second flight, made a sharp move in that path when
prompted to advance nearing the midway point of the turn, circled foes to gain the advantage racing into upper stretch and went clear under some left
handed pressure. SENT FROM HEAVEN angled inwards to track between foes in second flight, was held up avoiding tight quarters near the half mile
marker, continued just off the leaders through the turn, was prompted to advance when presented an opening in upper stretch, then was taken in hand
nearing the furlong marker when caught in close quarters, but was roused from between foes in the closing stages to secure the place honors. MR. KISSES
broke slowly losing position to the field, was guided outside foes while being hustled to regain contention four wide through the backstretch, continued three
deep on the turn tracking just off the first flight, couldn't match terms with the top pair but finished with interest to prevail for a share. OX TROT angled
inwards prompting a rival's pace in the opening stages, pressed the pace between foes through the turn to upper stretch, drifted nearing midstretch
momentarily impeding SENT FROM HEAVEN and proved empty in the closing stages. BACK PAGE sprinted to the lead while angling over to the rail in the
opening quarter, dueled for command inside foes to upper stretch and gave way. I'M A COOL MAN angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing
to the turn, briefly awaited an opening, shifted inside foes in the stretch and had no closing bid. J B QUICK settled off the second flight early, swung out six
wide racing into upper stretch but proved no threat. AMERICAN LUXURY broke outwards bumping the eventual winner. was collected to track off the
second flight near the inside but faded early.

into the far turn to close the gap on the pacesetter, wrested the advantage from that foe nearing upper stretch and went clear under firm left handed
encouragement. ECONOMIC POLICY was rated off the leaders while angling to the inside in the opening stages, continued under patient handling
conceding some position racing into the backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes after a half, steadily advanced on the leaders while shifting out
four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap while always second best. CARAMELITO was settled last racing to the first turn,
switched outside foes to race five wide into the backstretch, was prompted to advance with an early move to gain a position just off the leaders racing into
the far turn, shifted out three deep nearing the lane to bid between foes but quickly flattened out. HEY SACH, pulling against restraint racing three deep to
the first turn, moved clear while angling to the inside leaving the first turn, sprinted into the far turn, couldn't contain the winner's bid and came up empty in
the drive. TIZ ENVY, urged to gain a forward placing along the rail racing to the first turn, tracked the pacesetter along the inside to the backstretch and
steadily faded after a half. INDY RIDE, pulling between foes in the first flight racing to the first turn, shifted in nearing the backstretch to track the pacesetter
from just out of striking distance along the inside to the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. BIJEMINI SLEW angled inwards to track off the second
flight under some reserve but had no closing response. FLUG, a step slow into stride, switched out four wide nearing the backstretch to make some brief
