while inside on the turn, made a bid in upper stretch but was no menace while being second best in the end. DUST A FLYING chased the early pace while
two wide into the turn, made a bid then faltered in the drive. AIRLINE DRIVE unhurried early then rallied four wide on the turn, was gaining ground but was
no menace in the end. DO I MAKE YA SING saved ground on the turn then made a bid but faltered in the drive. NO MAS TEQUILA dwelt at the start and
was far back, was hustled along then raced four wide on the turn then flattened out in late stretch. SWEET TOMATOE PIE chased the early pace while two
wide into the turn then failed to menace. MOMMY WITT raced three wide on the turn and was no threat. SUPER LION GIRL was unhurried early and was
no threat. BRAVE NEW WORLD was inside then steadied off heels just after the quarter pole and lacked a rally in the stretch. A steward's inquiry was held
