Footnotes
MY WIFE IS BOSS sett a pressured pace inside of MORA VALLEY, asserted a clear lead in upper stretch, and drew off under urging in the final furlong
while drifting out slightly. MIKAYLA ATTACK settled near the rear inside foes early, dropped to the rail near the three eighths and rallied inside of MY JILLY,
angled two wide into upper stretch, and finished best of the rest between horses. MORA VALLEY was reluctant to load, pressed outside of MY WIFE IS
BOSS, proved no match for that foe in upper stretch, chased on but was narrowly outfinished for place. MY JILLY tracked the leading pair, was driven
between horses through the turn and into the lane, and made mild late improvement three wide. MISS IZZY settled at the rear inside of SAINT ALEXIUS
early, raced at the rear in the four to five path around the turn, was driven into the lane and passed tiring horses. TOMASITA chased two wide early, raced
three wide between horses on the turn and into the lane, and came up empty. SAINT ALEXIUS raced two wide in the rear flight early, was sent to join the
outside of the chasing flight past the five eighths, raced four wide on the turn and into the lane, but had no response when driven.

Footnotes
ROMEO O ROMEO cleared to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, stayed on the lead as BECAUSE IT'S TIME loomed to his outside in upper
stretch, and edged clear late. BECAUSE IT'S TIME tracked the pace outside of PETEIZUM, came in on that foe past the half mile mark causing him to
steady slightly, tracked ROMEO O ROMEO in the three path on the turn, loomed to the leader's outside in upper stretch, could not match his stride late, but
dug in gamely for place. AMAROQ chased midpack down the backstretch, was pushed along two to three wide on the turn, rallied four wide under a drive in
the lane, and missed the place three wide. PETEIZUM tracked the pace inside of BECAUSE IT'S TIME, steadied slightly past the half mile mark when
BECAUSE IT'S TIME came in, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the turn, rallied three wide in the lane but was outfinished between horses.
HAWK'S IMAGE settled in the rear flight inside of FRENCH MINDED early, was pushed along while saving ground on the turn, was boxed in upper stretch
behind ROMEO O ROMEO and inside of BECAUSE IT'S TIME, and weakened in the final sixteenth. A J'S POSSE chased two wide early, flattened to the
rear flight between horses approaching the turn, was driven in the five path on the turn, and had no rally under a continued drive in the lane. FRENCH
MINDED settled at the rear, raced in the six path on the turn, made no bid and was not persevered with in the late stages. THE RIDER OF PETEIZUM
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF BECAUSE IT'S TIME ALLEGING INTERFERENCE PAST THE HALF MILE MARK. UPON REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
WEILAND tracked the pace early, engaged outside of HE IS RHUTHLESS to press the pace two wide from the half mile mark, continued to press the pace
two wide through the turn and into the lane, seized the lead at the furlong mark and drove clear. MEADOWLEE'S AFLEET chased two wide down the
backstretch, was pushed along between horses on the turn, was driven three wide into the lane, kept on while no match for WEILAND, and narrowly held
the place. YOUNG CORBETT settled near the rear, raced in the four path on the turn, was driven into upper stretch, angled to the far outside near the
furlong pole, found his best past the sixteenth mark, made a belated outside rally and narrowly missed the place. HE IS RHUTHLESS cleared to the early
lead, set the pace while pressured by WEILAND past the half mile mark, continued on a pressured pace through the turn and into the lane, was headed with
a furlong to go and weakened inside. STRIKE QUIET chased three wide early, was pushed along while still three wide on the turn, continued in range to
midstretch and flattened out in the final furlong. FLYINGBYU chased inside foes down the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, and proved empty in
the lane. SPEARED settled at the rear, raced in the six path on the turn, and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
TIO CHUY set the pace, opened up in the two path on the turn, and kept on clear in the lane despite drifting out. JOHNNY CHADDA tracked inside of
TSALI, saved ground through the turn, angled off the inside near the three sixteenths, chased TIO CHUY under a drive but could not reel him in.
STANDFORTHEANTHEM chased three wide down the backstretch, lost ground past the nine sixteenths, was hard urged in the three path near the rear on
the turn, took closer order inside horses late but missed the place. LAST SPRING chased inside of RED PRINCE down the backstretch, switched out three
wide near the three eighths, was driven three wide into the lane, and chased on mildly. PRUDENT HERO soon trailed well off the rail, dropped to the inside
and began to rally while saving ground on the turn, and passed tiring horses under a drive along the inside in the lane. TSALI tracked the pace two wide
down the backstretch, continued in range between horses on the turn, and came up empty under a drive two to three wide down the lane. RED PRINCE
chased between horses early, weakened in the six path on the turn and continued to fade in the lane.

Footnotes
BELLA CHELITA broke inward and grazed the gate, shifted to the far outside down the backstretch, made a sharp outside move past the seven sixteenths,
engaged the leading flight three wide, continued three wide in the leading flight into the lane, disputed the pace outside of ISABELLE'S JOY from the three
sixteenths to the eighth pole, and drove clear in the final furlong. ISABELLE'S JOY tracked the early pace three wide, pressed outside of LAPIS STORM
around the turn and into the lane, disputed the pace inside of BELLA CHELITA from the three sixteenths to the furlong mark, proved no match for that foe
late but kept on a clear second best. STORMY EMPIRE raced at the inside of the tracking flight down the backstretch, saved ground behind the leading line
around the turn, came into the lane under a drive behind the leading flight, kept on mildly two wide and got into third position near the sixteenth pole. LAPIS
STORM was sent to set the pace, made the running while saving ground around the turn while prompted by ISABELLE'S JOY and BELLA CHELITA to her
outside, was urged to keep the lead into the lane as those foes continued to loom, was headed near the three sixteenths and weakened inside.
SUPERSTAR DIVA settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, and made a mild belated gain while drifting out under a drive in the lane. ANNIE
TIME GIRL chased between horses early, flattened two wide into the turn, raced outside of SUPERSTAR DIVA in the rear flight around the bend, and
continued to fade in the lane.

POWER SONG cleared to the lead, opened up down the backstretch, carried a clear advantage in the two to three path through the far turn, remained well
clear as JIMMY AT LAST attempted to rally in upper stretch, and drew off while kept to the task until the final fifty yards. JIMMY AT LAST was herded
inward by MISTER CHARMING in the opening strides, raced a bit keen inside horses through the clubhouse turn, tracked well off the leader inside of
MISTER CHARMING down the backstretch, continued at the inside of the tracking flight through the far turn, was driven in upper stretch to make a run on
POWER SONG, could not reel him in but chased on a clear second best. FLATSTER settled near the rear, switched two wide near the half mile mark,
chased in the three path toward the rear around the far turn, came into the lane at the inside of the rear flight, rallied inside of foes under a drive and proved
best of the rest. NEGRONI UP settled at the rear, trailed while saving ground through the first turn, continued at the rear down the backstretch, was angled
out into the five path for the run through the far turn, swung three wide into the lane, rallied mildly in upper stretch but could make no further headway in the
final furlong. CANARY ISLANDS raced between horses in the chasing flight through the first turn, continued midfield inside of BOOKIE'S BLUES down the
backstretch, was pushed along for a mild rally while saving ground through the far turn, continued under urging inside into the lane, but weakened from
midstretch. BOOKIE'S BLUES raced three wide in the chasing flight through the first turn, continued to chase outside CANARY ISLANDS down the
backstretch, was pushed along three wide for a bid past the half mile mark, improved to race three wide in the tracking flight through the far turn, but came
up empty in upper stretch. MISTER CHARMING stumbled at the break and herded JIMMY AT LAST inward in the opening strides, tracked well off the
leader through the first turn, continued to track outside of JIMMY AT LAST down the backstretch, began to fade between horses from the three eighths and
was outpaced in the lane.

Footnotes
PAMIR chased well behind the leading trio, was pushed along past the half mile mark, rallied in the two path on the far turn, came up inside of
LETTHEBIGSHOT ROLL near the five sixteenths, swung three wide into the lane in tandem with that foe, sustained his rally, took the lead outside of
ZANFORCE past the furlong mark and drove clear. LETTHEBIGSHOT ROLL broke outward, tracked well behind the leading pair, continued off the leaders
in the three path on the far turn, was driven past the five sixteenths, swung four wide into the stretch in tandem with PAMIR to his inside, continued to rally
but proved no match for PAMIR inside the final furlong, and kept on second best. FORGOT TO FORGET chased inside of ALPHA BOY and BLANKET OF
ICE through the clubhouse turn, continued inside BAHNKE and MALIGATOR near the rear down the backstretch, rallied under a drive while saving ground
through the far turn and into the lane, could not reel in the top two but got up for the show late inside of ZANFORCE. The latter set the pace, was pressured
by NOT CHOPPED LIVER down the backstretch and through the far turn, shook briefly clear in upper stretch as NOT CHOPPED LIVER weakened, was
headed past the furlong pole and flattened out. MALIGATOR settled near the rear, continued three wide near the rear down the backstretch, improved three
wide around the far turn and into the lane, and kept on without being able to make more headway late. NOT CHOPPED LIVER stalked off the pacesetter
through the clubhouse turn, pressed outside him down the backstretch and into the far turn, and flattened between horses in upper stretch. BLANKET OF
ICE chased three wide, was pushed along three wide into the far turn, chased in the four path around the far turn but lacked the needed rally in the lane.
ALPHA BOY chased between horses but weakened from the seven sixteenths. BAHNKE settled toward the rear, continued between horses near the rear
down the backstretch and into the far turn, went to a drive in the five path on the far turn and came up empty. OGEE'S EKATI settled at the rear, trailed in
the five to six path on the far turn, and had no response when asked.

SLICK SILVER cleared inside of GETTYSBURG into the first turn, pulled while setting the pace, confronted a bid from GETTYSBURG to his outside into the
far turn, shook him off from the three eighths, carried a clear lead into the lane, and held while all out late. BRUDER BOB chased well behind the leading
trio, was pushed along in the four path past the seven sixteenths, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, swung three wide under a drive into the lane,
rallied three and then two wide, and narrowly missed. FIRST MASAMUNE was anxious in the gate, settled near the rear, took closer order in the three path
on the far turn, swung to the far outside in upper stretch, sustained his bid under a drive, and got up three wide for the show. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER
chased the leading pair into the first turn, tracked the pace inside of GETTYSBURG down the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn behind SLICK
SILVER and GETTYSBURG, was driven in upper stretch but could not keep pace with SLICK SILVER, chased on, but lost the show in the final jump.
RIVER CACTUS settled toward the rear, continued at the rear of the main group two wide down the backstretch, was driven in the four to five path around
the far turn, chased on three and then two wide down the lane but was narrowly outfinished between horses for the show. GETTYSBURG showed early
speed but settled to track off of SLICK SILVER as that one pulled to the lead, tracked the pace two wide down the backstretch, bid outside of SLICK
SILVER into the far turn, was shaken off at the three eighths, and flattened out in the lane. FULL OF RUN chased inside foes into the clubhouse turn while
tugging early, continued toward the rear of the main pack inside of RIVER CACTUS down the backstretch, was pushed along in the two path on the far turn
but lacked the needed rally. IWILLPERSEVERE broke outward, hit the gate, soon trailed, continued well behind the field in the four path on the far turn and
mustered no bid.

ANDREAS chased four wide through the first turn, continued behind the leading line just outside of HERO OF FIRE down the backstretch, launched a bid
five wide into the far turn, encroached outside the leading pair past the three eighths, was driven into the lane three wide in the leading line, vied in upper
stretch, led near the furlong mark and edged clear in the final sixteenth. TALKING ZIP was bumped by Z U SOON in the opening strides, nonetheless took
the early lead, was pressed by Z U SOON and GIANT'S FORREST to his outside down the backstretch, continued to set the pace pressured by Z U SOON
around the far turn, vied inside of that foe and ANDREAS further outside past the three eighths, proved no match for ANDREAS from the sixteenth, but
outgamed Z U SOON for the place. Z U SOON broke in and bumped TALKING ZIP in the opening strides, stalked the pace through the clubhouse turn,
advanced to press between horses down the backstretch, continued to press outside of TALKING ZIP into the far turn, vied between horses past the three
eighths when ANDREAS joined outside the flight, proved no match for that one from the sixteenth pole and was narrowly outfinished for place. HERO OF
FIRE chased two wide between horses through the clubhouse turn, continued behind the leading line inside of ANDREAS down the backstretch, chased
under a drive in the two path on the far turn, proved no match for the leading trio in the lane but kept on gamely between horses to hold fourth.
SATURDAYS HANGOVER settled at the rear, was pushed along to rally inside of foes approaching the five eighths, improved while saving ground through
the far turn, and kept on inside horses down the lane. BEHIND ENEMY LINES chased inside foes through the clubhouse turn, continued at the rear of the
main pack down the backstretch, kept on in the two to three path around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch and chased on mildly four wide in the lane.
GIANT'S FORREST tracked the leading pair through the clubhouse turn, switched out into the backstretch to press the pace three wide, was no match for
TALKING ZIP and Z U SOON into the far turn, tracked the leading flight in the three path on the far turn, and flattened out three wide between horses in the
lane. ANDREW THE GIANT settled toward the rear, continued well behind the main pack down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn,
swung out and took mildly closer order five wide in the lane. SUZDAL settled two wide near the rear, continued in the rear group three wide past the five
eighths as SATURDAYS HANGOVER rallied inside, continued in the three to four path in the rear group on the far turn, and mustered no bid. SYRUP
chased three wide between horses through the first turn, continued four wide outside the leading line down the backstretch, came up empty past the half
mile mark, faded in the four path on the far turn and was no further factor. MAXIMUS IMAGE settled near the rear inside of SUZDAL, continued in the rear
group between horses as SATURDAYS HANGOVER rallied inside him near the five five eighths, raced toward the rear in the two to three path on the turn,
proved empty in the lane and was not persevered with late.
