came a bit off the rail in the stretch and continued willingly late. BORDER TOWN a bit slow to begin, angled in and stalked outside a rival, went three deep
on the second turn and into the stretch, bid outside in the drive and also continued on gamely late. COMMANDING CHIEF saved ground stalking the pace
throughout, bid inside in the drive and was outfinished. ON EASY STREET stalked between horses then a bit off the rail leaving the backstretch and on the

Footnotes
SHOOTIN MONEY stalked outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit in midstretch, bid outside foes under a couple cracks of the whip
and energetic handling to gain the advantage in deep stretch and gamely prevailed. BAD BEAT pulled between horses and steadied nearing the half mile
pole, stalked inside, came out leaving the turn and three deep into the stretch, took a short lead outside a foe in midstretch, drifted out some in deep stretch
and fought back to the line. MOSIENKO stalked the pace inside, came out into the stretch, bid between horses past midstretch, steadied in tight in deep
stretch and edged a rival for third. BALTIMORE BEECHO chased outside a rival then off the rail on the turn, angled in leaving the turn, came out in upper
stretch and finished with interest. JAXON'S GOLDIE sped to the early lead just off the rail, dueled outside a rival, fought back a bit off the fence in the
stretch and was outfinished late. YOU'RERIGHT AGAIN sent inside early, dueled along the rail, fought back on the turn and into the stretch and weakened
in the final furlong. Following a stewards' inquiry and a claim of foul by the rider of MOSIENKO against BAD BEAT, the latter was disqualified and placed
third for interference in late stretch. A claim of foul by the rider of MOSIENKO against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed by
the stewards, who blamed the trouble on BAD BEAT.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING FAST stalked three deep then went up four wide into the turn, bid three wide leaving the turn to gain the lead a quarter mile out, kicked clear,
drifted in from the whip in the stretch and won clear under urging and a hold late. AUDACE hopped in a bit of a slow start, chased between horses, was in
tight into the turn then steadied nearing the three eighths pole, split horses three deep into the stretch and bested the others. EL DIABLO ROJO stalked off
the rail then three deep between foes into the turn, continued off the inside, came four wide into the stretch, drifted in some in the drive and held third.
TALLEMARK chased inside, was shuffled back into the turn, came out on the bend and four wide into the stretch and was edged for the show. BERNIE'S
BIG BOY saved ground off the pace, came out some in upper stretch and lacked a further response. FANTASY GAME angled in and dueled inside, fought
back on the turn and weakened in the stretch. STIR THE POT broke in and steadied, moved up between horses then dueled outside a rival, was between
foes again leaving the turn and also weakened.
