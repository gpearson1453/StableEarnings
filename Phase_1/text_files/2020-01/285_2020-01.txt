second turn, angled out, bid five wide and got up for place while no match for the winner. IS IT GOLD saved ground, bid inside leaving the turn, had little left
for the drive and held safely for show. STAR SUNDAE pressed the pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. ACEITUNA was crowded and steadied at
the start, raced wide along the backstretch, dropped inside and lacked a bid. LAZZARELLA was through after a half. HILDA broke in, raced six wide along
the backstretch and was through after a half.

FIGHT TO GLORY set the pace, drew off on the turn and extended her lead while kept to task. OPPENHEIMER pressed the pace to the turn, fell back,
swung six wide and earned place while no threat to the winner. PONTIFICATOR pressed the pace to the turn, dropped back, went evenly late and just
lasted for show. LUV IS ALL U NEED veered out at the start, was never far back, bid inside, altered course near the eighth pole and was outnodded for
third. SHESAHEATWAVE raced close to the pace outside, went six wide entering the stretch and lacked a rally. ARTOIS SUNSET broke slowly and trailed
the field.

LIGHTS ON BROADWAY set a pressured pace to the turn, drew off entering the stretch and held safely while kept to task. ANGELS ON HIGH lagged early,
closed steadily, couldn't threaten the winner and finished second best. PRETTY RICH showed good early speed while racing inside, fell back on the turn,
bid, came up empty and held for show. ZUMBERTA challenged for the lead two across on the turn, fell back entering the stretch and gave way.
GLIMPSEDINTHEMIST bumped at the start, raced in the back in an even effort and was not a threat. KOOL QUEEN showed speed to the turn and gave
way. ANNIES TURN bumped at the start and had brief speed only. TIZ A DREAMER trailed the field.

WINNER'S DREAM was unhurried early, saved ground, rallied on the turn, bid six wide, dueled to the sixteenth pole and drew off under strong urging.
CONSTANT CRAVING pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the second turn, dueled to the sixteenth pole and faltered to finish second best.
GOLDIE'S DARLINS set the pace, responded when challenged to duel to mid stretch, faltered and just lasted for show. UH OH SEVEN raced inside,
stalked the pace while racing in hand, got through along the rail to contend, didn't have enough late and was outnodded for third. ONLINE REQUEST was
never far back in an outside trip and lacked a stretch response.

Footnotes
PRIMO TOUCH stalked the pace, rallied into the second turn, assumed command, drew clear and held in a driving finish. STRATTON stalked the pace
while racing inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out, bid five wide and finished well to earn place. CHOCOLATEICECREAM saved ground, bid along
the inside on the turn to get within striking distance, hung late and settled for show. CHRISTINE'S JACK raced mid pack, went six wide entering the stretch
and lacked the needed rally. MASKED dueled to the second turn and flattened out. OUT OF PATIENCE passed a tiring rival. BOUNDARY BAY dueled
inside to the second turn, tired and stopped.
