Footnotes
GREAT SALVATION set the pace with pressure from POINT RECEIVED to the outside, cleared that rival and inched away on the turn and into the stretch,
carried a comfortable lead through the final furlong and was ridden out to the wire. GRACIE'S GIRL angled in from the outside and stalked the pace, went
two wide around the turn, rallied between rivals late and got up for second. KATHIA forwardly placed three deep, chased outside a rival then three wide on
the turn, fought three deep off the fence in the final sixteenth and was edged for second. POINT RECEIVED broke out and bumped rival at the start,
pressed the pace from the outside, asked to keep up nearing the turn but could not match the leader, moved in to save ground on the turn, cut the corner
into the stretch and was outkicked for third. LADY MAXI stumbled at the start, saved ground chasing the pace, asked in the lane but lacked any response.
SUPER MISS B HAVEN bumped at the start, raced near the back of the field, took the turn two wide and also failed to rally. BRITE TAN bumped both sides
at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and proved no menace.

kept to task with right-handed reminders in the late stages. UNEXPECTED JOURNEY dueled from the inside, came in tight quarters enteringthe turn and
was forced to check, chased the leader to the lane and finished willingly for a clear second. ROCK N DOC stalked from the inside, angled out on the turn,
never produced a bid but held on for the show. ATTERCOP unhurried in the beginning, raced outside a rival, floated out a bit on the turn then angled to the
inside and missed the show. BRAGGART stalked off the rail, went three wide into the turn, floated out a bit around the bend then angled in nearing the
eighth pole and failed to rally.

Footnotes
HACK stalked along the inside into and around the turn, bid along the rail and gained a short lead into the stretch, battled GUTSY STREAK through the final
furlong and prevailed under urging. GUTSY STREAK sped to the front, set the pace with a narrow advantage to the turn, lugged out around the bend,
challenged HACK in the late stages but was outkicked. HOLLYWOOD SKY chased three deep into the turn, carried wide by GUTSY STREAK around the
bend and kept on willingly for the show. REIGN ON (GB) chased from the outside, went four deep into the turn then carried wide by rival lugging out,
straightened course in the lane but weakened. NOVA chased to the outside of the pacesetter, between rivals into the turn, pinched by GUTSY STREAK and
forced to check back, went two wide into the stretch, shifted inward in the lane and had little left for the final sixteenth. QUANTUM FORCE settled just off the
pace, raced outside a rival then angled out on the turn and failed to response in the final furlong. Following a Stewards' inquirey, GUTSY STREAK was
disqualified from second to fifth for lugging out and forcing NOVA to check on the turn.

Footnotes
LEEDSLIMIT set the pace from the two path to the turn, angled over to the inside and padded the lead on the turn, asked in the upper stretch and held
safely with right-handed urging. REAL QUICK tracked off the rail, three wide then outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and held the place. MR
BINGLEY lacked early speed and trailed the field, saved ground into the lane, summoned a late rally and could not get by REAL QUICK for second. YES I'M
WILD chased the leader along the inside, two wide leaving the turn, between foes in the stretch and weakened late. SCRAMBLED traveled outside of MR
BINGLEY while failing to show early speed, went two wide around the turn then came out into the stretch and never threatened. Due to a timer malfunction
the fourth race was hand-timed and no fractions were recorded.
