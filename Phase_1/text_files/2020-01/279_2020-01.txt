FORGER sprinted clear at once, raced four-wide while setting the pace, drifted out slightly through the lane and drew off with little need of urging. GO FOR
A STROLL was reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, reached a striking position but could not gain on the winner in the drive.
TYGER TENNESSEE lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly late. OFFENSIVE showed
no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. REBOUNDER chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way in
the drive. FLYING ROLLEX broke sharply to chase the winner while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half.

SOUTHERN FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. VEIL'S VENGEANCE pressed the pace
while racing four-wide, moved up to engage into the stretch, gained a slight advantage but could not resist the closers late. DIABOLICAL TIME was
forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late response. TERRAS SONG raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. MR MOO pressed the pace from between foes and gave way through the final furlong.

gave way through the final furlong. GO DANI GO showed no early speed, saved ground throughout and did not reach contention.
