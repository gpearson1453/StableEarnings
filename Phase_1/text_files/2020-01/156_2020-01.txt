Footnotes
PRINCE OF NEW YORK sat forwardly placed for the opening three-quarters, was given its cue spinning into the lane, forged to the front by midlane, then
held sway. BANK GALA stalked the pace from the two path during the run around the bend, angled five wide for the drive home, narrowed in for second.
GOLCONDA departed the pace from the two path, went six wide into the lane, flashed some late foot en route to securing the show. KID CHOCOLATE well
off the inside throughout, raced four wide on the turn, got sent out into path seven from upper to midlane, made no impact. DUTCHMEN FOREVER
assumed a prominent position after losing his footing springing from the starting gate, sparred for the top from the two path, got cued up for the drive home,
kept up its quest for another furlong before giving way. IMPLIED VOLATILITY vied for command from along the inside route for three-quarters and faltered.
DISCIPLANARIAN took up the chase three wide after stumbling at the start, commenced the stretch slightly wider, had no rally. GO WITH HONOR failed to
menace off a ground-saving journey. MASTERPRIZE travelled two wide for the opening six furlongs, was moved out four wide entering the lane, failed to
contend.

Footnotes
SADIE LADY established the front and showed the way in hand from the three path uncontested, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, went three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive and held well and clear to the finish to prevail. CAPE COD DIVA bumped at
the start and leaned on by COUNTABLE who broke inwards, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, offered up a mild bid to secure the place honors. DIRTY BIRD chased two to
three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, improved position to procure the show honors. CALINAS SONG
stumbled at the start breaking on top despite it, chased four then three wide placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went four wide for home and
weakened. COUNTABLE broke in at the start bumping and leaning on CAPE COD DIVA, chased five then four wide coaxed along from the
seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
KUMAR established control in short order, sailed along being rated on the inside route until the five-sixteenths pole, left that station having been switched
over a light hand ride after the closest pursuers had all been called upon much feverishly themselves, arrived at the three-suixteenths pole before being
called upon himself, responded to win by a comfortable margin. WALKOFF closed in steadily three wide on the turn, swung into the lane and proved no
match. HIZAAM took up the chase from the two path on the turn, got sent out six wide from upper to midlane, went on to secure the show. CREATIVE
STYLE stalked the winner three wide on the turn, was asked to pick up prior to the quarter pole, tipped one path farther off the rail into the lane, gave way.
BOZZINI strung out four wide on the turn, went into path five for the drive home, had no rally and backed away. LATER CAT prompted the winner from the
two path, going about its task from between rivals on the turn, was being roused by the five-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch and folded. VARIANT
PERCEPTION saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
CHOWDA coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide to the inside of COLORMEPAZZI, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home, dug in under a drive knocking heads through to the finish and was up in the final jumps to prevail. MICROSCOPE six paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying in the final furlong, fought on to the finish to get up for the place honors in the last strides to the wire. COLORMEPAZZI fractious in the gate prior to
the start, broke in at the break, recovered to range up and duel in hand five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding stubborn to a slim lead through to the final
strides then got overtaken by a pair while well clear for the show honors. FOREVER WICKED seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased five
wide through the turn placed to coaxing with three furlongs to run, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. BIG PACKAGE four then three wide in
pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. CRAY CRAY chased just off the inside until tucked inside
at the half mile pole, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
NICKY SCISSORS established control in short order after being brushed in the shadow of the starting gate, cut over towards the inside route, showed the
way being rated along, spaced at a slight distance off the rail, stepped into the stretch and was given her cue in the general area of the three-sixteenths
pole, responded, opening up a commanding advantage by the beginning of the final furlong, got geared down in the final seventy yards, ventured onward to
cross the finish line far in front, worth noting having accomplished it all on the wrong lead. STONEZAPPER pursued the pace three wide on the turn, proved
no match during the stretch run. MAKINGCENTS took up the chase from the two path on the turn, shifted out five wide down the stretch en route for the
show. GIRL'S WAVE prompted the winner from its outside, going about it from between rivals for a good portion of the run around the bend, spun into the
lane under brisk encouragement and backed away. HELENE JACQUELINE underwent a two wide pursuit after being brushed from both sides shortly after
the start, waited briefly behind others coming up to the quarter pole, was put to a ride spinning into the lane, flattened out. NEW YORK SUPREME made
light contact with another shortly after the field had been sent on its way, rated unkindly, appearing keen instead with the pilot steadying the mount along for
much of the opening half, mustered up a challenge with less than optimal clearance when let out a notch, as the half was being completed, was eventually
checked about a sixteenth later, never regained interest thereafter. HELMERS RUN pursued the front runners four wide on the turn, had no rally. CRYSTAL
STEPS strung out five wide on the turn, dove over to the rail late on the bend in time to cut the corner into the stretch, faltered. WAR GODDESS pinched
shortly after the start, chased the pace from just off inside on the turn, was maneuvered in the direction of the four path once in the stretch, folded.

Footnotes
CAVARADOSSI two to three wide in pursuit just off the duel, got set down angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home,
then edged away to the finish to prevail. OUR STORMIN NORMAN four wide in closest aim of the leader early on, tucked three wide advancing to duel with
that foe through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive in command, got headed a furlong
from home, ran on to secure the place honors. CAUSE FOR APPLAUSE three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three
wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. DR. DEVERA'S WAY four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CHUCKLES six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three
to four wide through the turn, came under a ride midway, went five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FOTIS chased along the inside
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN established the front
crossing to show the way in hand from the two path, had OUR STORMIN NORMAN advance into the turn and dueled with that rival to the outside coming
under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, succumbed and faltered in the drive. BEACH FRONT stumbled badly
and could not recover falling at the start and tossing the rider, recovered to his feet walking to the temporary rail before jogging off to the outside rail and
was apprehended by the outrider, then walked off under his own power. There was a Stewards' inquiry into the start focusing on BEACH FRONT before the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
JOEVIA brushed shortly after the start, chased the pace under some coaxing along the backstretch afterwards, departed it from the three path, sat perched
within striking distance of the front runners vying with each other for control, picked up interest after the half had been rattled off, got cued up challenging in
earnest spinning into the lane, fought his way to the front end during the ensuing furlong, dug in late to preserve the decision. IDENTITY POLITICS
squeezed after the field had been sent off and running, got going after an abbreviated hand ride, stepped onto the turn from the two path, saw ter pilot resort
back to some hand encouragement a few strides later, got called upon in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths pole, angled five wide into the lane, straightened
away and rallied for the place. MR. DOUGIE FRESH went at it with SEETHISQUICK after undergoing some light contact in the shadow of the starting gate,
sparred with that foe from path two, forced to do so from between rivals leaving the three-eighths pole, swung into the lane under a drive, battled onward
before weakening late. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was guided into the four path on the backstretch, patiently kept an eye on the pace combatants, got driven
into the lane, made no headway. SEETHISQUICK got engaged with MR. DOUGIE FRESH, went at it with that opponent from along the rail, saw the
pressure increase as a couple of others added themselves to the pace picture after more than halfway around the bend, was put to a drive for the drive
home, relinquished soon afterwards then steadily backed away. THE SICARII darted over to the rail coming up to the conclusion of the backstretch, stayed
put to the end of the bend, was tipped out into the two path at the head of the stretch, had no response and wound up nearly trailing throughout.

BE MAGIC forwardly placed from the start, got bumped and carried out four paths by ASSAULT AND PEPPER as that rival bolted about five paths outwards
near the seven-eighths pole, knocked heads in hand from the four path with that same rival to her inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into
the turn taking over command at the seven-sixteenths, shook off ASSAULT AND PEPPER inside that station now confronted outside by EMPRESS
LUCIANA and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, shook steadily away and swung just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to
the finish to prevail. EMPRESS LUCIANA six paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide half a mile from home, advancing
to apply pressure to the aforementioned foe to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one weakening in the final furlong but was able to preserve the place honors over a pair at the finish. LIL MORNING STAR four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, improved position to secure the show honors on the line. HOPE I
CAN broke a half a beat slow, raced eight paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and weakened in the final eighth. STUY TOWN BABY broke in at the start bumping I AM AINE, chased five
wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. SHES
EUPHORIC four wide in pursuit, came under a ride seven-sixteenths out, angled five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact. I AM AINE
bumped at the start by STUY TOWN BABY, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and floated out four
wide inside that station, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired. ASSAULT AND PEPPER away to the front from the start, suddenly bolted out
four to five paths bumping and carrying out BE MAGIC near the seven-eighths pole before being corrected, knocked heads in hand with that rival to her
inside in the three path, tucked inside half a mile from home, got headed at the seven-sixteenths and came under coaxing, faded through the turn, went
three wide for home and was eased through to the finish. BIG CYN coaxed from the gate, had the rider apply a near sided grip as his charge fought the bit
pulling to the inside, ducked in reaching the intersection of the clubhouse turn when leaving the chute and lost the rider prior to jumping the temporary rail
before coming back to the backstretch sans rider, was apprehended by outrider and walked off under her own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the
incidents on the backstretch before the result was declared official.
