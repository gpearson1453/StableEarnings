DOODLE HOPPER broke readily to gain a clear advantage, dictated the pace in the three path racing into the turn, then held sway in that path into the
stretch while being kept to firm right handed encouragement. NATIVE HAWK tracked just off the pacesetter racing to the turn while switching just outside
that rival, was roused to challenge midway through the turn to late stages but could never gain even terms. THANK YOU angled to the inside early tracking
the leaders from just out of striking distance but offered no rally.

Footnotes
BYE BYE MELVIN, fractious when momentarily dislodging his rider prior to the start, broke sharply to gain a narrow advantage, dictated the pace along the
rail to the far turn, then responded to firm right handed pressure to gamely hold the challenge of ME AND MR. C to the end. The latter brushed HIGH
HEATER at the start, was firmly rated just off the leaders while angling to the rail racing into the backstretch, switched out leaving the midway point of the far
turn while readily moving to terms with the pacesetter between foes, continued with a steady bid to late stages but proved only second best.
MUCHMORETHANTHIS tracked just off the leaders between foes in the opening half, came around a tiring foe leaving the far turn to gain some position
between foes racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. HIGH HEATER, brushed from both sides at the start, switched outside foes racing to the
backstretch, made brief progress three wide racing into the far turn to gain striking distance after six furlongs but proved empty in the drive. MATTY'S
EXPRESS, a bit restless in the gate, pulled his way along the inside, then raced a bit rank under restraint through the first turn, settled inside foes on the
backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch but quickly came up empty. BRECKENRIDGE broke inwards brushing HIGH HEATER, moved to
terms with the pacesetter racing to the first turn prompting that rival, continued to prompt that foe to the far turn but quickly emptied out.

Footnotes
FREE DANCER broke sharply, dictated the pace along the inside racing through the backstretch, shifted out a bit racing into the turn while maintaining a
narrow advantage, then kicked clear in the stretch, widening under firm encouragement. POZNAN, forwardly placed between foes tracking just off the
pacesetter, continued with a steady bid to prevail for the place honors in the closing stages. TITHED broke awkwardly while making some contact with
KEYLARGO at the start, angled to the inside while being prompted to gain striking distance nearing the turn, shifted inside the pacesetter on the bend, was
steadied slightly nearing upper stretch, then altered course outside the leader racing into the stretch and was outfinished for second. SPEAKERIT tracked
off the second flight while shifting a bit off the inside in early stages, angled out four wide racing into the stretch and finished evenly late. THREE OLIVEZ,
delayed proceedings momentarily when requiring a late rider change, broke a bit slowly, dropped well off the field and never gained contention. DOHKO
ducked out at the start, was collected to track off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn but faded early. KEYLARGO, bumped at the start, was
quickly righted to gain a forward placing three deep tracking just off the pacesetter to the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
J P'S GIA broke readily to gain a clear advantage, angled sharply to the inside dictating the pace on a comfortable margin in the opening quarter, shifted out
racing into the turn while being urged to resist the bid of LUNA AZTECA, dispatched that foe while shifting well off the rail racing into upper stretch and held
sway through the lane on widening margin under firm right handed encouragement. MADISON BLUES tracked off the second flight near the inside in the
opening quarter, angled out on the turn, then to the five path in upper stretch and finished with a steady late response to prevail for the place honors in time.
FERGIELICIOUS, urged to gain a forward placing racing three deep just off the pacesetter into the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and
weakened late. LUNA AZTECA was urged to gain a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter between foes in the opening stages, advanced to prompt
the pacesetter racing into the turn but flattened out in upper stretch. NERVE LINE broke inwards making some contact with MILBRA, was collected to track
just off the second flight, angled to the rail racing into the turn but had no closing bid. MILBRA broke awkwardly, then was bumped while throwing her head
just after the start, quickly dropped off the leaders and lacked a rally. SISTER DRAMA proved no factor.

Footnotes
JUAN PABLO was rated along the inside from just out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, saved ground into the far turn gradually advancing on
the leaders, shifted out in upper stretch to bid between foes nearing the furlong marker and edged forward of SOUPER COURAGE in time under firm right
handed pressure. The latter, reserved out of close quarters just after the start, raced between foes tracking off the second flight to the backstretch,
advanced to striking distance while angling to the inside leaving the midway point of the backstretch, was prompted to challenge inside the pacesetter when
presented an opening leaving the three furlong marker, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing past midstretch but couldn't contain the winner.
LASSITER dictated the pace on a narrow margin inside a rival, shifted a bit off the rail maintaining a narrow advantage racing through the backstretch,
resisted when challenged while racing between foes through the far turn, was fanned three deep past midstretch and couldn't match the top pair late.
LUNDQVIST, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being rated out of striking distance, shifted to the three path on the backstretch, gained some
position between foes while angling nearer the inside nearing upper stretch, then shifted out four wide late while finishing with an even effort. RELISHMENT
broke readily, angled inwards racing to the first turn to track just off the first flight, angled out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to
advance, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch and had no late response. TEMPLE CITY STAR, bumped soundly, then shuffled back at the start,
was settled last to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing into the far turn, was caught five wide through the second bend while making an effort to
gain some position, then was fanned six wide through the stretch while fading late. RATTLESNAKE RIDGE attended a rival's pace under light reserve
racing to the backstretch, was urged to press the issue three wide into the far turn and gave way early. ED'S DOG tracked the leaders three wide between
foes to the backstretch and faded early. MIAMI SMUGGLER veered out at the start bumping TEMPLE CITY STAR soundly, was collected off that foe, then
was reserved near the inside and offered no rally.

Footnotes
LIL BULL, forced out a bit at the start, was urged to regain terms with the leaders in the opening stages to join the pace four wide between foes racing into
the turn, shifted inwards a bit on the bend pressing the issue outside a rival to upper stretch, went clear while angling to the rail in late stages and just
maintained the advantage to the end under pressure. ASPEN SNOW, bumped at the start, was settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn,
steadily gained contention three wide between foes to upper stretch, found his best stride in the closing stages to challenge the winner nearing the wire,
then was vanned off the course when failing to return to be unsaddled. AWESOME ROMEO settled along the inside racing to the turn, altered course
avoiding close quarters to split foes just off the inside racing through the stretch and improved his position to the end. ERIN GO BRAUGH, urged to prompt
the pace three wide between foes into the turn while briefly striking the front, gave way into upper stretch. HAPPY GUY, forwardly placed five wide stalking
the first flight, was urged to advance in that path racing into the turn but soon emptied out. BOLTER ducked inwards at the start bumping ASPEN SNOW,
was collected to track off the first flight while angling inwards racing into the turn, was urged to advance between foes nearing upper stretch but had no rally.
DELIVERED BY AKISS, off a bit slowly, switched outside to race three wide between foes to the turn but offered no rally. SOMMER LEGACY proved no
factor. NOBLE KING was urged inside foes prompting the pace while racing well off the rail to the turn, gave way after a half. SCHILLER NAV ducked out at
the start crossing the path of the eventual winner, flashed brief pace between foes prompting the leaders to the turn but retreated early.

Footnotes
ON A SPREE angled to the rail leaving the chute tracking just off the pacesetter under light rating to the backstretch, continued to stalk that rival along the
inside into the far turn, switched out in upper stretch while being urged to challenge for command, readily took over and went clear in the closing stages
under firm hand urging and a right handed tap. DRILLOMATIC sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, edged
away to a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner. CHIEF OF JOY tracked off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground through the second bend and responded to edge a rival for a share. SINDARIUS tracked off the second flight between foes, was
prompted to gain position three deep between foes to upper stretch but had no late kick. SLEEPLESSDREAMMORE, off a bit slowly, switched outside rivals
racing to the backstretch, was caught five wide racing into the far turn, then to upper stretch and faded steadily in the closing stages. DOPO LAVORO
tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief bid three deep between foes racing through the far turn and
quickly came up empty. PARTICIPATION CUP hopped at the start while ducking in brushing GILDED DRAMA, settled last to the backstretch near the
inside, became a bit rank while under restraint switching out midway through the backstretch and proved no threat. GILDED DRAMA, brushed at the start,
was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the pacesetter outside the eventual winner to the backstretch but gave way early. PAUL CANE tracked the
leaders outside foes off the second flight, was prompted to make an early move four wide nearing the far turn while between foes and quickly came up
empty.

stretch, couldn't match the winner late but held a rival for the place honors. MISS LOTUS FLOWER settled along the inside in early stages, shifted out on
the far turn to gain position between foes into upper stretch, then angled to the rail in the closing stages while edging a rival for a share. JUANANDORA,
settled out of close quarters just after the start, was prompted to advance three deep between foes racing through the far turn to upper stretch and
continued with interest while just outkicked for a share. SWEET GELATO was hustled to the lead while angling over to the inside racing into the first turn,
set the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside the top pair to upper stretch and gave way. TRACK MAGIC stumbled at the start, settled near

handling. HANIEL tracked off the second flight along the inside under light reserve racing to the far turn, angled off the inside while being prompted to
advance racing into upper stretch, altered course nearer to the inside following the winner's path between foes nearing midstretch and continued with a

attended that rival's tempo under light reserve to the far turn, was urged to press the issue on the second bend to upper stretch but gave way between foes
nearing midstretch. MALLIE CRAMP, caught in tight quarters in the opening stages, was steadied, then shuffled a bit while dropping off the field, raced wide

off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, was urged to make a brief bid three deep between foes on the far turn but flattened out in upper
