Footnotes
DIVINE PASSAGE broke alertly, ceded the early lead to AMMARA and stalked her stablemate through moderate fractions heading to the turn, chased two
to three wide into the bend, was asked for run into the stretch and battled AMMARA nearing the furlong marker, took command and shook free into the final
sixteent, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held safely for the win at the finish. DAVID N RAYS CANDY off a step slowly leaving the start, was
hustled to be forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the modest pace while saving ground into the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed into the final
sixteenth, could not reel in the winner into deep stretch and was up in time to secure place honors. AMMARA assumed command of the early running, set a
moderate pace into the turn and dictated terms nearing the quarter pole, came under pressure from DIVINE PASSAGE in upper stretch and met her
stablemate's bid approaching the furlong pole, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and
just held for third at the wire. SUSIE CRU broke out at the start then made contact with a neighboring rival and was off a bit slowly, was allowed to settle
while not far back in the early stages, saved ground into the turn, tipped three wide for the drive, rallied in the final sixteenth and just missed for third.
SOUTHERN BLESSING tracked the early pace from the outside, chased three to four wide into the turn and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, swung
widest into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LOOKOUT PASS made contact with SUSIE CRU leaving the start and was a bit slow into stride
early on, trailed into the turn, raced two to three wide to the quarter marker and did not factor.

YODERANDO hustled away from the start, assumed early command and set a contested pace nearing the half-mile pole, showed the way into the turn, was
well handled while carving moderate fractions approaching the quarter pole, dug in into upper stretch and held a narrow lead at the furlong marker, kept to
task while holding foes at bay into the final sixteenth and lasted for the win in the final strides. ROSES R BLUE hard to load prior to the start, settled in the
second flight in the early going, saved ground into the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and chased the leaders nearing the furlong marker, rallied
into the final sixteenth, could not catch the winner in the final strides and got up for second at the wire. MATCHLESS took back off of the moderate early
pace, tracked the decent pace two to three wide into the turn, swung five wide for the drive and lost ground at the furlong marker, closed well into the final
sixteenth and just missed for second, while just getting up for third. LILA AT THE BEACH prominent leaving the start, pressed the moderate pace between
rivals heading to the half-mile pole, disputed the pace between runners into the turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, battled YODERANDO into
the stretch, chased into the final sixteenth while on her left lead and was outfinished in deep stretch. HOLLYWOOD RUMOR broke alertly, ceded the early
lead and stalked the pace three wide heading into the turn, bid three wide along the bend and vied for the lead at the quarter pole, lost position into the
stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch.

SENSATIONAL Z Z prominent away from the start, stalked FAR OVER LOADED while two to three wide approaching the quarter pole, confronted that rival
nearing the top of the lane and battled to mid-stretch, repelled FAR OVER LOADED and shook free into the final sixteenth, edged away under hand urging
in deep stretch and proved best in a good debut. FAR OVER LOADED broke alertly and established the early lead, showed good speed and carved out
decent fractions nearing the quarter marker, was confronted by SENSATIONAL Z Z into upper stretch and met that rival's bid approaching the furlong
marker, battled into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with SENSATIONAL Z Z into deep stretch and was second best. EL MAGA settled off of the
early pace, was caught a bit wide into the turn then was guided to the rail midway through the bend, angled out in upper stretch, closed willingly in the late
stages, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for third. SURF STAR took back off of the decent early pace, was guided
two wide along the turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. NIJINSKY HALO hopped at the start, lacked early speed and saved ground into the turn, was
outrun into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

moderate fractions nearing the quarter pole, repelled GOOD FOCUS into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, drew away into the final

into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, chased the winner into the final sixteenth and was a clear second best. CARDINAL TRICK broke in
at the start and was away slowly, was unhurried in the early running, saved ground into the turn and trailed nearing the quarter marker, could not impact the
top pair in the stretch drive and passed tired rivals in the late stages to secure third. MR BIG BUCKS was forwardly placed leaving the start, chased the
decent pace from between rivals and was well positioned heading into the turn, shifted to the rail and and lost ground nearing the quarter marker, was
outrun into the stretch and gave way in the late stages. SPLIT ACES chased the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and was outrun approaching

Footnotes
IRISH PRANCER broke alertly, ceded the early lead to BRONZE GIRL and stalked that runner through decent early fractions, advanced into the turn and
pressed BRONZE GIRL nearing the quarter marker, drew to even terms with that one in upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, shook free into the
final sixteenth and drew clear late under firm hand urging. LISA'S ANGEL tracked the decent early pace from the outside, mounted a three wide bid along
the turn and came within range nearing the quarter marker, chased into the stretch, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and was second best. BRONZE
GIRL broke out a bit at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, showed good early speed and set the pace approaching the half-mile marker, was
pressured into the turn by IRISH PRANCER, met that rival's bid in upper stretch and battled to the furlong pole, could not match strides with IRISH
PRANCER into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. SANGER STYLE was bumped by a neighboring rival at the
start and was away slowly, was keen in the early running and pulled on the rider nearing the half-mile marker, tracked between rivals approaching the turn
and was shuffled back a bit entering the bend, made a mild gain three wide at the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and ran evenly in the final
furlong. RIVER OF AMBITION was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace from between runners and was well positioned heading
into the turn, lost ground along the bend and chased two wide nearing the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and lacked a late response.
MIRAGE CODE tracked the decent early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and lost position at the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch
and gave way.

Footnotes
GADDING broke well, was taken in hand but floated four wide through the first turn, tucked inside under cover halfway down the backstretch while still under
a tight hold, got a ground saving trip through the far turn, was cut loose and bid from the quarter pole full of run, took command at the top of the stretch and
won clear despite drifting in and out under alternating right and left handed urging. FANCY FASCINATOR was sharp from the gate and sprinted to the lead
eagerly with the jock doing his best to try and temper the pace, set decent fractions and responded when set down for the stretch run, outfinished all but the
winner. SPARKLE SWEETLY worked to get off the rail passing the finish line for the first time, moved out to the two path then took a stalking position behind
FANCY FASCINATOR and shadowed that foe to the far turn, loomed a threat passing the quarter pole but could not go on with the top two, had some
trouble changing leads a the top of the stretch but finished well once straight, kept to task and won the head bob for third. FIREWORK allowed to settle from
the break, raced mid-pack inside with the second flight of horses down the backstretch, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, finished well under
steady handling but came out on the short end of the photo for third in a decent effort. LEMON HAZE was restless in the gate then broke poorly, was last
and went three wide through the first turn despite the rail being available, raced greenly down the backstretch but still advanced into contention out in the
four path, continued to race wide through the far turn then raced greenly in the stretch and could not improve. NAKOTA (IRE) was allowed to settle into
stride from the break and was next to last and well behind going into the first turn, was then pushed on to get closer for the run down the backstretch, lugged
out while racing on the wrong lead down the backstretch, was outrun through the far turn, continued to lug out down the stretch but managed to pass one in
the late stages. ANOTHER SUMMER showed some speed from the gate then tracked close up three wide to the far turn, was making a four wide move
then ran over a duck approaching the quarter pole, then came up empty in the stretch while having some trouble changing leads.

Footnotes
DONTIM broke out a step at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, tracked the early pace from the second flight, rushed up nearing the half-mile marker
and vied for the lead at that station, contested the decent pace with WINNING LOVER into the turn, took command at the quarter pole and shook free into
upper stretch, was kept to task while leading into the final sixteenth, was all out to hold off the runner-up in deep stretch and determinedly lasted for the win
at the wire. FORD FLYER chased the decent early pace from the second flight, was well placed approaching the turn and ran in pursuit three to four wide
nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch then rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and just missed for the win, while besting
the rest. WINNING LOVER hustled for the early lead, assumed command and set the pace approaching the half-mile marker, was engaged by DONTIM at
that station and contested decent fractions with that runner into the turn, dueled along the bend and lost ground to DONTIM at the quarter marker, chased
into the stretch and fought on into the final sixteenth, could not keep match strides with the top pair in deep stretch and held safely in the end for third.
LISA'S DOCTOR S prominent away from the start, raced close up to decent early pace while between runners, maintained a two wide path into the turn and
chased the pace while between rivals nearing the quarter marker, lost ground while running on the left lead at mid-stretch, switched leads effectively into the
final sixteenth but could not muster a late response. LET THETRUTHBETOLD was crowded at the start and broke slowly, was allowed to settle in the early
stages while not far back, chased four wide into the turn, needed more in the stretch drive and offered a mild late rally. MR. DUFF took back off of the
decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and trailed nearing the quarter pole, lacked a response in the stretch drive and did not factor. FLYING OZZI
broke awkwardly at the start and was away a bit slowly, rushed up in the early going and tracked the decent pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn
and was well placed nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and tired in the final stages.
