Footnotes
FAR FROM A STAR pressed the pace in the three path, took over leaving the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under a drive. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE
raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied outside to gain the place. TAPIT'S DIRECTION raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show.
AHORSEWITHNONAME chased the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the
needed rally. FIFTY ONE FIFTY was outrun inside. GINGERSNAP JACK played no factor while racing two wide around the turn and swinging five wide in
upper stretch. PERSONAL DRAMA broke a bit awkwardly, sped to the front the set the pace in the two path and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
CASPIAN SEA (GB) stalked in the three path, bid two wide midway around the far turn, swung from the four path into the lane, took command passing the
eighth pole, and dug in to hold off his outer stablemate late. MUNTALIQ checked and bumped an outer foe while floating out to the four path midway around
the first turn, rated inside down the backstretch, was cued from the rail midway around the far turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and
ran on for place. RED ABARRIO laid up close along the inside, tipped out to the two path under coaxing midway around the far turn, floated out to the seven
path entering the lane, and finished evenly for show. WE GOT THIS showed the way along the inside, received a right handed cue when challenged midway
around the far turn, but faded from the two path in the stretch. JOE FROM KIEV got bumped by an inner foe at the start, trailed in the three path, floated out
to the five path midway around the far turn, and made no impact. WHAT PLAN bumped with an outer foe shortly after the start, then got bumped out to the
five path midway around the first turn, chased in the three path down the backstretch but never threatened. AMAZING JETT broke out an bumped an outer
foe, then bumped with an inner foe shortly after, tracked in the three path but was empty entering the lane.

RED HOT SPARK stalked in the two path, tipped out to the three path midway around the turn, was coaxed to bid from the six path turning into the lane,
took the lead passing the eighth pole, and edged clear. VAYESTA bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the three path early, was driven
between foes in the two path around the turn, angled inside in upper stretch, and ran on for place. REVOLU showed the way in the two path, floated out to
the four path while receiving right handed cues turning into the lane, but finished evenly to be caught on both sides for show. STARSHIP DYNASTY got
pinched at the start. trailed in the two path, swung out to the six turning into the stretch, but made no impact. KHOZANKA broke in at the start, chased in the
four path, was ridden in the five path around the turn, but failed to factor from the seven path down the lane. FINAL NOTE bumped with an inner foe at the
start, rated in the four path, was driven in the six path around the turn, fanned widest out to the ten path at the top of the stretch, and never threatened.
MRS. CASH MAN prompted the pace in the three path but was empty entering the stretch. MY SWEETHEART DANI raced off the pace in the two path but
never menaced.

CRYSTAL COAST raced in range two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. LADY DOMINANCE bumped at the start, raced
off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and never threatened. BIG BAND LUZZIANN was bumped between foes at the start, pressed the
winner two wide and tired in the drive. BOSTON PRINCESS broke outwardly and slowly, raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked a closing bid.
VICTORY BADGE was pinched back at the start, raced three wide around the first turn, made a wide middle move down the backstretch but faded four wide
around the far turn.

SIN FOR A SEASON stalked in the four path, was roused midway around the turn, swung from the five path into the lane, and inched clear in the final
furlong. GIRVIN GIRL led in the three path early, was cued midway around the turn, dug in from the three path into the stretch, but was edged out in the
final furlong to place. UNRELENTLESS pressed the outer leader in the two path, was roused from the rail passing the three-eighths pole, faded from the two
path down the lane, but held show. ADIOS BABE tracked in the two path, angled out to the six path turning into the stretch, but flattened. ATALANTA
ALEXANDRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path and made no impact. JAYANA chased inside, tipped out to the seven path in
upper stretch, but never threatened. BLUEISH got rank as the gates opened and bumped with an inner foe, rated in the three path but never menaced.

EASTERN EMPRESS (GB) saved ground off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, rallied outside but
could not reel in the winner. ENDURING stalked the pace two wide in the clear, bid between foes in midstretch but was outkicked in the final furlong.
BRITISH EMPRESS set a fast pace along the rail, led to midstretch and weakened. GILDED EDGE played no factor while racing three and four wide.
