Footnotes
JET FLIGHT stalked the pace down the backstretch, rallied up the rail saving ground on the final turn, angled out in upper stretch, engaged the leader in
midstretch, drifted out brushing that one late in the lane and prevailed in a determined drive. LITTLE STEVEN set a pressured pace for the first five-eighths,
took command nearing the quarter pole when the presser failed to corner, briefly had a clear lead, responded when challenged by the winner and battled to
the wire while being brushed late in teh drive and just missed. T LAW unhurried in the early going, rallied four wide making up ground steadily on the bend
and kept-on willingly through the lane. BOURBON LIFE trailed most of the trip and showed late interest to be closing in deep stretch. ANCIENT MAN
tracked the leaders from three wide and lacked a closing kick. SILVER CHILLER pressed the pace to midway on the far turn, attempted to bolt on the final
turn, was taken in hand and eased to the wire. THE TRAINER OF LITTLE STEVEN CLAIMED FOULD FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN,
UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
FIRST LOVE sped to the lead away from the gates, set a quick pace while well in hand, responded when called upon to open a clear advantage turning for
home and drew off in hand as much best. SAMARITA stalked the pace through the turn and rallied well in the lane to be a clear second best. ALLOTROPE
went evenly and came along for the show. PROBLEMATICA prompted the pace to the top of the lane and weakened. ANGEL EXPRESS tossed her head
when the gates opened to be rank, was slammed by inside rival and knocked sideways a stride from the gate and somehow gained ground enough to be in
contact with the field at the wire. BALI BABY broke outward, bumping rival hard and being well off stride early and kept-on to close to the field in the stretch.

RED LABEL stalked the pace to midway on the turn, commenced a five wide rally to engage the leader in mid-stretch and pulled clear in a determined drive.
RIVZONAROLL bobbled at the start, sped to the lead, set a pressured pace, disposed of the presser nearing the quarter pole to be clear briefly and could
not hold off the winner late in the lane in a game effort. TIME HEIST unhurried early to be the trailer on the turn while saving ground, angled out to the six
path in upper stretch and finished with good energy to be gaining late. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY was not a threat. BOURBON TEDDY pressed the pace for
a half and gave way turning for home.

STYLE unhurried for the early going, rallied six wide circling the field, made a steady gain through the lane and surged late to be up in time. GO STORMIN
GIRL reserved of the pace, rallied four wide making a steady advance on the pacesetter, engaged that one inside the eighth pole to take the lead in deep
stretch and was caught in the final strides. TAP N TWINE set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear advantage on the turn, responded willingly
down the lane and was outkicked late. SUMMER AT THE SPA well placed into the turn, made a brief bied on the bend and flattened out. LADY ATLANTIC
failed to menace. STACK SHACK pressed the pace for a half and faded in the lane. SHEZA HOOT contended early, dropped from contention and was

Footnotes
TOSCANO stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied three wide to engage the leader in upper stretch and prevailed in the drive. RIVER RIDGE
tracked the leaders into the turn, circled five wide on the bend under constant urging, engaged the leader late in the lane, came together in deep stretch with
the winner and dug-in but missed at the wire. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET set a pressured pace throughout, responded in the lane and weakened late in the
stretch. YOUNG MISCHIEF pressed the pace fro mthe inside to upper stretch, lugged in to the rail, straightened away and gave ground late. PONTUS was
not a threat. LONE RETURN was not a factor.

Footnotes
BEEALEA unhurried early, gained ground into the final turn, circled five wide rallying strongly on the outside and pulled clear late. REMEMBER THE MAINE
set the pace from the onset, opened a clear lead down the backside, maintained the advantage to midway down the lane, dug-in gamely but could not hold
off the winner. LAND MARK DEAL tracked the leaders from the rail and lacked closing response when called upon. JEFF THE LION traailed most of the
way and passed tiring rivals in the lane. BAKENEKO stalked the pace to the far turn, made a bid in upper stretch and flattened out. DYNABLUE prompted
the pace for three-quarters and faded.

Footnotes
GOD GUNS N GUTS stalked the pacesetter to midway on the turn, rallied three wide while steadily advancing to the lead and held sway at the wire. THE
SPEEDY ONE tracked the leaders around the turn, was under steady urging nearing the quarter pole, angled out in the lane and found his best stride late to
just miss. DEFIANT MALICE reserved off the leaders through the turn, rallied belatedly in the lane to gaine the show. LATE BLACKSMITH sped off to a
clear lead and weakened coming home. BORDER PATROL raced mid-pack and lacked a response when called upon finishing evenly. POND was not a
threat. PONCHO ATTACK showed early foot and was through early. PIRATE MARMALADE had the saddle slip, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
ICE SHARD tracked the leaders down the backstretch, saved ground rallying on the final turn, cut the corner at the top of the lane and overtook the
pacesetter late in the lane under a strong inside drive. RUNWITHHEART set a pressured pace to upper stretch, responded when engaged by the winner in
the lane and dug-in gamely but was outkicked late in teh drive. DANVILLE reserved off the leaders to the far turn, rallied from three wide on the bend, drifted
well wide in upper stretch and finished willingly. AQUACAT pressed the pace for three-quarters and flattened out in the lane. DAPPER DUDE failed to
menace. SPAN was reluctant to load pre-race, contended for the first half mile and came up empty on the turn. THE WINNING NUMBERS FOR THE
PLACE PICK 8 WERE: 1/3-2/3/4/5/7/10/11/12-2/5-2/6-4/7-2/3/4/5/7/9/11/13-6/8-2/4
