Footnotes
MIDNIGHT IN ALASKA was bumped at the start, then went up to set the pace while clear, remained clear and raced in the two to three path on the turn,
then was given one right handed pop with the crop by the furlong marker and then was flagged and few times to the wire to keep a safe margin to the wire to
prove best. AEGEAN SEA stalked the winner three wide and ran on willingly to the wire to be clearly second best. SIX O'CLOCK SARAH was reserved
early, coaxed along on the turn and moved out to be four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide into the lane and had a late rally to gain the show award.
NORMANDY LIFE pulled early and was in between rivals, then advanced two wide by the quarter pole but faded late. STASSI chased the pace from the
outside, four wide on the turn and angled in nearing the quarter pole and weakened. RUSTY MY BROTHER tracked the early pace on the inside and
stopped.

leaving the turn but had no rally. INSTPARTY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the far turn but weakened. MANITOULIN ISLAND was
settled back on the inside and was not a factor. MOON POOL was five wide into the first turn, settled four wide and was never a threat.
