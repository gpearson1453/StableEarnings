BACLIFF vied between rivals down the backstretch, was in a hard drive while pressing the emerged leader throughout the turn, then found more in the late
stretch to shake clear and was up in time to prevail. SCOOTER'S HONOR battled for the lead from the inside, gained the short lead on the turn, was driving
grudgingly then was out finished by BACLIFF in the late stretch and was best for second. HIGHLANDER HONEY vied for the lead while three deep,
continued to press the pace throughout the turn, then drifted out in the late stretch while in a gamely menace and missed the place position. GOD KNOWS
WHY tucked along the inside at the back and was no threat. LOVE ME DO broke outwardly and was no factor.

leaving the bend to rally in the stretch and kept on for the place position. CRANKY SHEILA dueled with an outer rival throughout, remained in a gamely
drive down the lane then was out finished by an outer rival in the late stretch and missed the place prize. COWGIRLSLIKEBLING chased the pace from the

the turn, was in a long drive in the stretch, then was out finished by an outer foe. GOLD MEMORIES was allowed to settle while four wide then came out
four wide leaving the bend and rallied too little too late stretch. SPACE PIRATE was impeded at the start, angled inside at the back, then rallied mildy in the

FIRE VISION broke inwardly, then set the pace from the inside, was pressured by an outer foe on the turn, shook clear and drew off in the stretch to prevail
in the end. RUMPUS chased the pace while two wide, was urging steadily on the turn to move up and duel for the place position in the late stretch and was
up for the place prize. BENDELENE settled at the back early, inched up while four wide on the turn, then sparred from the outside for the place prize in the
lane and missed at the end. JAN'S TURN TO WIN chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace throughout and needed more in the end.
STRESSED was allowed to settle while two wide in the early furlongs, angled out five wide leaving the bend and came up empty in the stretch. WILLOW
MOON pressed the from the two path while in steady drive, lacked the winning to over take the pace setter on the turn and gave way in the stretch.
CHIKARA was impeded at the start then was out run.

TURN NORTH was allowed to settle at the back along the rail, continued to save ground throughout the turn, then found the best stride in the late stretch to
draw clear and prevail in the end. RIPSTER chased the pace while two wide, then came up four wide leaving the bend to bid between rivals, gain second
position and held onto the place prize in the end. SON OF A BLING trailed at the back early, came out five wide leaving the turn and was improving position
in the late stretch and was best for show. MY BUDDY MEL raced in the middle of the fields from the inside, remained at an even pace throughout the turn,
then bid in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. BANDERA BLING pursued the pace from the inside, rallied leaving the far turn then kept on
while in a mild drive down the lane to no avail in the end. HEZAKOOLKAT pressed the pace while two wide, then gained command at the quarter pole, was
in a gamely drive, then was out finished in the late stretch. FLAT OUT PERFECT was no threat. BUBBA'S RECKLESS set the pace from the inside into the
turn, was overtaken by an outer rival at the quarter pole, then gave way in the remaining furlongs.

Footnotes
COUNTY JUDGE broke outwardly and bumped foe, then raced from the inside between fields down the backstretch, bid eagerly on the far turn while two
wide then pulled away in the stretch to prove best in the end. ONE LAST BID saved ground in the early stages, gained third position on the far turn, then
lacked the winning bid in the stretch and was best for place. DINERO DE LA CASA was allowed to settle while two early, then menaced while three wide on
the far turn and continued in mild drive down the lane and was up for third place. TURQUOISE BLUE led the way into the first turn to set the pace from the
inside down backstretch, cleared the far turn then faltered in the stretch. HOLD MY BEER BRO stalked the pace from the two path while in a steady drive in
the early stages, then faded after the far turn and had nothing left in the home stretch. GET RIPPED drifted inward at the start and was no menace. BLAME
DENNIS was bumped on both sides at the start, stalked the pace while three wide early, then dropped back after the half and lacked rallying in the stretch.
