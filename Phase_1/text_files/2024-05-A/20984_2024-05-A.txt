second. GOLD N SILVER battled for the lead two wide into the turn then lacked the needed response in the stretch. MIDNIGHT MIKEY contested the early
lead along the inside and faded late. GIFT OF OAK trailed.

FIONA was bumped at the start, went up to press the pace two wide before a quarter, took over midway on the turn, was put to right handed urging in upper
stretch and maintained her advantage under strong handling. PINK PARTY PANTS prompted the pace three wide and was no match for the winner while
well clear for second. MAKES SENSE TO ME passed a tiring rival late. KRISTIN broke outward bumping the winner, set the pace along the inside until the
middle of the turn then was used up.

MONTAUK COVE broke alertly to set all the pace and maintained his advantage under mild right handed urging. MORE THAN GOOD chased the winner
two wide and finished clear for second. ROCK ON KITTEN never far back, finished with good courage two wide. APACHE failed to menace. CUMBER had
good early speed three wide, dropped back on the turn then lacked the needed response. FRONTLINER offered a mild bid along the rail through the turn
then came up empty.

OFFICIALLY YOURS chased the pace two wide into the stretch, drew on even terms for the lead near the furlong marker, brushed with the runner up in
deep stretch and proved best by a slim margin under right handed urging. EXACTITUDE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace along the
inside into the stretch, dug in gamely when joined by the winner, was brushed by that one and just missed hanging on in a game effort. HIGHLY
EXPLOSIVE trailed along the inside for a half, drifted out to the five path bumping OH GLORIOUS DAY at the top of the stretch then passed tiring rivals.
MIZ KEETA stumbled at the start, chased the pace along the inside into the stretch then faded. OH GLORIOUS DAY had good early speed three wide, was
bumped entering the stretch then gave way. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
