Footnotes
PRETORIAN GOLD chased the early leader two deep, moved up to challenge through the far turn, was four deep into the upper stretch and finished well to
prove best under strong handling. CITIZEN MACK settled off the early pace, moved up three to four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the
wire. MAT MATTERS stalked the pace, hard ridden three wide between rivals near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. BROKENHEARTED was
off slowly, raced off the early going after the poor start, lacked room near the eighth pole, shifted out a bit racing two to three deep and had not enough.
WE'RE EVEN raced mid pack early, was along the inside around the far turn, shifted out four wide through the drive and raced even with no closing bid.
TACTICAL HUMOR showed good early foot along the inside and gave way. BE THE MUSIC raced off the early pace, swung six to seven wide into the
upper stretch and never was a factor. MR MIEDO failed to sustain a bid.

and kept on and kept on gamely to the wire. FREEDOM'S START settled off the early pace, raced four wide in the stretch and rallied well for the place
position. BLAZING RED was allowed to settle early, had an inside run and no late response. MO MOSCATO tracked the early leader two deep from the
outside of rival and gave way. COUNTERFEITCURENCY stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and weakened. GOING AT IT failed to

FANCY FREE showed good early foot to set the pace early and weakened along the rail. HE AROSE stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter

LASTCHANCE ROMANCE settled off the early going, advanced from the outside through the far turn and finished well to circle the field six wide under
strong handling. FREYDIS was off slowly, raced at the back after the poor start, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and finished gamely to the wire.
PYROTECHNICS pressed the early leader two deep from the outside, led into the stretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. MOONSHINE WARRIOR
chased the pace near the inside, moved up two deep near the quarter pole while in tight quarters and had no final winning bid racing three deep in the drive.
FIREBALL EXPRESS showed good early foot along the inside and weakened through the drive. AWESOME GLO was under steady urging early two deep
and gave way. LAVINIA SPIRIT chased the pace from the inside, clipped heels near the quarter pole, jockey of Lavinia claimed objection for interference
near the quarter pole and stewards ruled no change.

MILLROSE tracked the early leader two deep from the outside, dug in from the inside of Ziffy Bug through the stretch run and finished determined to prove
best under strong handling. ZIFFY BUG stalked the pace, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole to challenge, led narrowly but was outgained late in a
game effort. ENSUING GRACE raced five wide into the first turn, moved up three wide around the far turn, drifted a bit through the stretch and was even
with no closing run on the top pair. REZQUIA was allowed to settle early, raced two to three wide in the drive and lacked a rally. LOOKING FANCY was
unhurried early, raced three to four wide in the stretch and had no response. JUMP A FOX quick to begin to set the early pace and was done early.
