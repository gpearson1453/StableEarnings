MO SMOKING saved ground setting the pace under pressure from PRINCESS TENKO, responded to left handed encouragement during the drive and
prevailed narrowly. PRINCESS TENKO pressed the pace while racing two-wide but was unable to get by the winner in a game effort. MAIDEN ROCK was
reserved off the pace while racing two-wide and finished in a mild rally. SIGNATURE STREET prompted the issue while three-wide to the stretch and
weakened. POINT OF INFINITY was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch but was not a factor. LOTTA ROSES saved ground while being
close-up for a half mile and then gave way.

Footnotes
PINK LADY LU SHA prompted R KATIEBUG from along the outside, took the lead from that one nearing the quarter, opened clear lead nearing the eighth
pole and then was all out to prevail. CALISUE was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. R
KATIEBUG saved ground setting the pressured pace, angled out nearing the eighth pole when cleared and held on fairly well for third. SALLY'S SUPRISE
was reserved off the pace racing two-wide, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer a bid and then flattened out during the drive. VISIONISTA
saved ground while being allowed to settle but lacked a rally when asked. SECRET OPERATION was unhurried early after hopping at the start, came
three-wide into the stretch but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
EUCLID AVENUE saved ground setting the pace under pressure from HAY MOON, shook that one off nearing the quarter pole then drifted out to the middle
of the track and quickly drew clear. PERFORMANCE PLUS saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and
finished in a mild rally. SKYLANE saved ground while being reserved off the early pace, slipped through to offer a bid nearing the eighth pole and then
flattened out during the drive. TEMPLE FOOL saved ground while being unhurried, moved through during the drive and improved his position. HAY MOON
prompted the pace from along the outside to near the quarter pole and weakened. MONEY AGENT was forwardly placed for five furlongs racing three-wide
and
tired.
