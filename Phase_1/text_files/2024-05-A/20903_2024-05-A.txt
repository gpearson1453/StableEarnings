Footnotes
POINT PELEE chased the pace from the outside of rivals, was three deep around the far turn and finished well to edge up under strong pressure. MAJOR
THOMAS stalked the pace early on near the inside, continued an inside run past the quarter pole, checked near the eighth pole, angled out and finished
gamely to the wire. Jockey of Major Thomas claimed objection against Point Pelee for interference through the stretch run and stewards ruled no change.
LILTONYTWOPHONES showed good early foot along the inside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. FOLE'S NOTION dropped back early on,
advanced three wide around the far turn, angled out to race from the far outside in the drive and moved up to improve position. BAZINGA D tracked the
early leader two deep and faded. RIDLEY PARK failed to respond. WARRIOR'S CAUSE raced mid pack early, raced four wide into the upper stretch and
lacked a rally. NIGHTSCAPE raced seven wide into the upper stretch, lost ground and never was a factor.

TOMMY THE TORCH tracked the early leader from the inside, shifted out three wide to challenge just past the five sixteenths pole and finished well to edge

well for the place position. INDIRECTLY trailed early on, swung wide into the upper lane and moved up to improve position. PICTOR was sent off to a clear
early lead, confronted through the far turn and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY stalked the pace, raced near the inside

Footnotes
JAKE BRAKE ALLEY set all the pace along the inside and drew off to be well clear late under strong handling. PENTATONIC tracked the early pace setters
from the outside, took aim near the three sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. BAG OF GOLD raced mid pack early, hard ridden three wide
between around the far turn, shifted out to race from the far outside in the stretch and had not enough. UTILITY chased the pace between rivals early on,
dropped in two deep near the quarter pole and was even with no late bid. SYLVIA I AM was bumped at the start, lag early on, swung wide into the upper
stretch and moved up to improve position. LUCKY DOUBLE ZERO was allowed to settle early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and had no final bid.
SHELTRFROMTHESTORM chased the pace from the inside and weakened. RUNAWAYTOTHEMOON was bumped at the start, dropped back and lacked
a bid. GOTTA HAVE HEART failed to sustain a bid. J R JONE Z was bumped at the break and never menaced.

SPLICETHEMAINBRACE chased the early pace from the outside, raced two deep around the far turn, five wide into the upper stretch to take aim and
edged up under strong handling. GENGHIS dropped back early, moved up four wide around the far turn and rallied well in the drive to get up for the place
position racing five to six wide. BRIT'S CANDYMAN pressed the early leader, took full command near the five sixteenths pole, had a clear lead nearing the
eighth pole and weakened. ROMANTIC GAMBLE void of early speed, swung wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. GRAB THE
GOLD chased the early pace three deep and weakened. YES IT'S ROO raced from the far outside in the drive and lacked a rally. GAGETOWN dropped
back to race mid pack early, had an inside run and never was a factor. CAPT. CANDY was off slowly, rushed near the rail to an early lead and faded.

FOXY JUNIOR rated off the early leader, assumed command through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under mild urging to be a handy winner.
SWAN POINT settled off the early going, moved up three wide around the far turn, kept on but was no match for the winner. MS STRONG HEART dropped
back early, raced four wide in the drive and raced along for third. KNICKERSINATWIST showed good early speed and tired readily.
