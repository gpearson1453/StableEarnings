Footnotes
CATALINA EXPRESS dueled on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and kicked clear in the lane. COASTAL RIVER raced
at the back of the pack early, continued around the turn in the four path, swung wide into the stretch to began a bid and gained ground late from there.
TESTA DURA bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the
two path and improved position in the stretch. VINDICATED TIGER dueled on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and
weakened in the stretch. MR. DEMEANOR dueled between horses through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane. Z
RACES chased the leaders early, continued around the turn in the three path and tired in the stretch. IN THE BLUE was pinched back leaving the gate,
settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path and was outkicked in the stretch.
VITTORIANO bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was not a
factor.
