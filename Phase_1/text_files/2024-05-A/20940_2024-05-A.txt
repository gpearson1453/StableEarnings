Footnotes
STYLISH SUE was quickly over to the rail to lead inside and held sway under steady handling. MENDEE pressed the early pace in the three path, bid at the
three-eighths pole but then couldn't match strides in the drive. REDO stalked the pace inside, angled five wide at the quarter pole and bid belatedly to gain
the place. CAT'S SYMPHONY stalked the pace inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole, bid inside of REDO and was outfinished for the show. MOTHER
FREEDOM was steadied early, raced well back, bid six wide on the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. ROCK LUCKY was squeezed back at the start,
raced six wide around the far turn but had no late kick. FROSTY TALE saved ground and improved position late. WHAT YOU WISHED was off awkwardly,
stalked the pace between rivals but faded on the far turn. MER SOLEIL pressed the early pace between rivals before fading on the far turn. CITY OF
GLITTER was through early. PROUD DIVI was squeezed back at the start, stalked the early pace in the four path but faded in the stretch.
