DURANGO JESS vied for the early lead near the inside and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE pressed the early
leader two deep from the outside of rival but was no match in the drive. WHERES BRAYDEN raced two wide between around the far turn and raced along
for third. EL CHUMELITO had an inside run and raced evenly. SILVERBULLITBADGER raced four wide around the far turn and never was a factor.
RUNNINGINTHERAIN urging to lay up close, bothered by loose horse into the upper stretch and faded. PROBATE stumbled at the break and unseated his
rider.

Footnotes
ATHENA'S STORM was urged three deep around the far turn and edged up late under strong handling. MANGO MOON chased the pace two deep, made a
good rail bid in the lane and narrowly rallied for the place position. WAY RITE dropped back early, surged late from the outside in the drive and closed in too
late. OLIVIAN was sent to a clear early lead and weakened in the drive. REAL ME chased the pace, came out deep stretch, Peggy B Fast claimed objection
against real Me for interference and stewards disqualified Real Me and placed him eighth. BYE BYE BROOKY raced six wide into the upper stretch and had
no response. BLUE COWGIRL raced from the far outside in the stretch and had not enoughl. PEGGY B FAST was forced to check deep stretch and never
was a factor. I WIN LIKA GIRL saved ground and never threatened.

IM STILL THIRSTY prompt the early pace from the outside of foe and finished well to edge up under strong handling. REIGN OVER ME stalked the pace,
moved up three wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. RANGER REX set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened through
the drive. RELAXED ARTIST (IRE) raced mid pack early, was four to five wide into the upper stretch and flattened out. DIXIEMAGIC broke a bit awkward,
dropped in down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and was even with no closing run. PINEY BLUFF was allowed to settle early and failed
to respond. WEALTH N HEALTH stalked the pace and faded. PRIVATE TRAX failed to sustain a bid. I AM THE JUAN lost ground and never menaced. The

WRECKING STORM vied for the early lead, raced four wide between around the far turn and just got up under all out pressure. DISTORTED GUY chased
the early pace, made a good rail bid in the drive and finished game to just miss. CODIS BREAKER chased the pace from the outside, raced five wide
around the far turn and finished willingly to the wire. I'M A DREAMER TOO was fanned seven wide into the upper lane and finished willingly to the wire.
ATTILA'S ACE had an inside run and not enough. HERMISTON raced four to five wide around the far turn and weakened. FASTTRAINTOTEXAS dueled
two deep and faded in the drive. IFFY ASSET CLASS swung wide and lacked a bid. MR. MCFEELY failed to menace.
