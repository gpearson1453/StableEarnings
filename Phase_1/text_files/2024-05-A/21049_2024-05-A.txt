BECKETT'S BEST settled off the early pace while settling off the dueling leaders, commenced his bid from along the inside entering he final turn, shifted
three wide in the drive and closed determinedly to get up in the closing strides. STANFORD NORTH away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, put away his pace rival leaving the final turn, to open a clear advantage, and just failed to last. DIVAANY broke sharply and tracked
the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the
needed closing response when called upon. STOPSHOPPINGSHELLY unhurried early while dropping well behind the rest of the field entering the
backstretch, launched her bid from along the rail from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive. EARS
TO US away well, and raced three out from the rail entering he first turn, while conceding a narrow lead to STANFORD NORTH, pressed that rival for the
lead two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and weakened in the
stretch drive.

FLYING MISS broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of E Z TONIGHT entering the backstretch, continued to battle for the lead from the
outside of that rival entering the final turn, took control midway through the turn, and held off STILETTOS ONLY late to prevail. STILETTOS ONLY settled
off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn, shifted five wide for the
drive, and closed with a rush while gaining late to prove second best. SHESBOURBONONICE away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run down the
backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive in an even effort. E Z TONIGHT
away well and vied for the lead from the inside of FLYING MISS entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the
final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival leaving the turn, and faded in the late stages. MINI MARKET stalked the early pace into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.

CURLIN ROCKS broke sharply and raced to the lead entering the first turn while racing just out from the rail, set a pressured pace in the run to the final turn
from the inside of B CHU CHU, opened up on that rival through the final turn, and drew clear while being ridden out late as much the best. B C CHU CHU
away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue from the outside of CURLIN ROCKS in the
run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival through the final turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive to prove easily second
best. ANDALEIGH settled at the back of the pack while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished one out
from the rail in the drive to garner a share. ON MY GOOD SIDE stalked the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, dropped back to trail
the field entering the final turn, and failed to respond when called upon. MR MORRIS refused to break from the gate. Following the running of this race the
stewards conducted an inquiry into the start of the race, it was deemed that all horses received a fair start, and that MR MORRIS just refused to break. No
change was made to the original order of finish.

NO PEOPLE away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of LUCY TREASURE entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the
run down the backstretch and through the final turn, drifted two wide entering the lane, before angling in in mid stretch and caused WANDALITA to clip
heels, but finished gamely to hold on to prevail. WANDALITA hopped at the start, but recovered quickly to track the dueling leaders in the run down the
backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn while awaiting room, attempted to slip through at the rail in mid stretch
but took up when in tight quarters and clipped heels, but battled gamely to hold the place. LUCY TREASURE away well and dueled for the lead from the
outside of NO PEOPLE entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was
unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the lane, but finished willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. BELLAROO broke sharply and
tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, but hung in the late going while
finishing five wide in the drive. QUALITY COMMAND stalked the leaders into the backstretch at the back of a compact field, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, but was unable to make a late impact. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry, and a jockey's claim of foul involving
an incident in mid stretch. The rider of WANDALITA lodged a claim of foul against the rider of NO PEOPLE for alleged interference. After review the claim of
foul was upheld, and NO PEOPLE was disqualified from first and placed second.

while laying in late to get up in time. CROWN COUNCIL away well and raced to the lead from the outside of GO LENT GO entering he backstretch, took a
clear advantage into the final turn, and finished determinedly from along the rail in the drive to just miss. HORATIO away alertly and stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, was no match for the top pair late, but finished three wide in the
drive to prove easily best of the rest. GO LENT GO broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering he first turn, chased the pace of
CROWN COUNCIL from along the rail in the run down the backside, saved ground through the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. HIGHLINER

FINDING WAYS away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of BUTTONWOOD TREE entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the rail entering the final turn, disposed of his pace rival leaving the turn to quickly open up a clear lead, and held an unlucky
BROKE AN BROKEN safely at bay late. BROKE AN BROKEN broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing one out from the rail
in the run down the backstretch, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, steadied sharply when BUTTONWOOD TREE took his path
away leaving the turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive. ROOKIE YEAR unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced his bid from
along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. FLORIDA GATOR settled off the early pace while
racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
BUTTONWOOD TREE away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of FINDING WAYS entering the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in
the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace rival leaving the turn, and dropped to the rail causing
BROKE AN BROKEN to steady sharply, and had little to offer late.
