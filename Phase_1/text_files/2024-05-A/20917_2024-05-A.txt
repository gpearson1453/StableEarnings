Footnotes
CHASING SHADOWS back off the pace and the rail, floated out four wide when advancing exiting the turn, lost some ground to the two leaders, set down,
closed with good resolve to be up in time. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF dueled up front while in the two path, continued to alternate through the turn and into the
stretch, edged away inside the furlong marker, could not contain the winner, remained clear of the others. DIVA TREVA dueled up front along the inside,
could not match the winner the final furlong nor contain the winner, held sway for show. ABBY THE BULL DAWG last away, void of speed toward the inside,
moved out to be three wide turning for home, improved by passing tiring rivals, slowly gaining for the show. SINGING EMMA in the second flight along the
inside, steered three wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. DOCS SEVEN went one paced inside. SHE BE SHEEHAN second group in the two path,
steady faded through the lane.

Footnotes
TEE BURNS broke sharp, cleared toward but not to the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage through the turn, not threatened through the lane
while under steady handling. RIFEY broke a step slow, lacked early foot, angled out four wide when beginning to advance late in the turn, rallied while well
out in the strip to be in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. RARE STRIPE chased the winner in the two path, remained closest to that one through
most of the stretch, had little for that one the final furlong, nipped at the wire for the place. LIGHTNING STRUCK in mid pack while outside, four wide exiting
the turn, finished with some mild interest, not enough for the place. TROPIC STORM went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. moved off
the rail a bit for the drive, continued in even fashion the final furlong. COLT FICTION in the second flight while three wide into and through the turn, came up
empty for the stretch run. LAMUTANAATTY in some traffic between horses late backstretch, dropped to the inside midway on the turn, moved closer in
upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. CIBOLO failed to menace in the two path/. AWESOME FAMILY tired while racing three wide. LOOKIN FOR
REVENGE off step slow, void of speed, carried out five wide by the runner up turning for home, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LEMONESSE in the second flight for a half three wide, crept closer to the leader entering the stretch, continued to steadily close the gap through midstretch,
engaged that rival with a sixteenth to run and wore her down under firm handling. HURRICANE FIRE took command after the start, stretched that
advantage out through the turn, continued to lead by daylight with less than a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly to the winner to be overtaken in the
final strides. WOWSERS void of early foot, continued to lag midway on the turn, five wide into the stretch, showed some late interest down the middle of the
strip to be along for the show. BARSTOOL BABE off a step slow, was outrun while saving ground turn,continued to run the rail through the lane, outkicked
late for the show. OUTWORK MOM in the second group while along the inside, came in the two path for the drive, had little left in the late going. IRISH
SPARK remained back while four wide out of the turn. ROYAL ARTS in the second group while between horses, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED TWISTER forwardly placed inside early, shuffled back late backstretch, moved out, angled four wide turning for home, bid soon after, shook
clear past the furlong marker and slowly increased that advantage under steady handling. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN in mid pack while just off the inside
early, raced two to three wide into the stretch, finished up willingly to be well clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. GOLD STRATEGY off a
step slow, moved up to race in the main group off the inside, staged a mild rally to garner the show, no match for the top pair. TIMBAVATI broke alertly, vied
up front while between horses into and through the turn, weakened through the stretch. DIXIE GIRL TO lacked speed well out in the strip, four to five wide
turn, improved position while not posing a serious threat. KITIARA with the pace up the backstretch, continued to vie while three wide through the bend,
faltered in the drive. THE GIRL IN RED set or forced the pace along the inside, gave way in upper stretch. QUEENIES WAY made little impact while racing
three wide. PAT'S GAL lacked early foot, in traffic entering the turn, remained back when clear for the drive. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE failed to menace while
racing four wide. WAR MUSIC off slow, moved up a bit then was finished before a half to trail home.

Footnotes
Q'S YOUR MAMA with the pace from the start, dueled onto and up the backstretch, shook clear far turn, maintained a daylight advantage past the furlong
marker, enough left to just last. PERCEPTIVE forwardly placed early along the inside, steered three wide when moving closer turning for home, continued to
finish with good resolve to be getting to the winner late to narrowly miss. AIR CASTLE broke a bit inward, settled off the pace and the inside, four wide and
with the second fight into the lane, finished up best of the rest without making much progress on the runner up late. DR. WOODS MIRACLE off step slow,
void of any early speed, three wide into the lane, displayed some modest late interest to improve position, between foes late. ADAMANTLY away in good
order, dueled up front inside the winner along the rail, first to blink far turn, continued to gradually weaken through the lane. I BE GONE four wide into first
turn, raced one paced in mid pack, failed to rally. LOST LOVE dropped inside, saved ground to no avail in also lacking a rally. ELUSIVE EMPRESS lacked
speed, failed to rally while racing in the two path. MISS TERRE void of speed in falling back to trail, was never a factor. BEE BRANCH stopped after a half
along the inside, finished far back.

Footnotes
ART QUEEN outrun in the early going, asked along late turn when beginning to advance, rallied from between foes past the furlong marker, steered out a
bit and continued with good energy to win going away. PETIT JEAN forwardly placed up the backstretch outside, pressed three wide through the turn, took
over in upper stretch, clear a furlong out but proved no match for the winner late. DEVIOUS DIVA in mid pack early off the inside, in some traffic early turn,
two path through the bend when clear, dropped inside for the drive, mild interest to be clear of the others. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN bit tight at the start,
raced one paced off the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn, continued evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. SPARKLY pressed the issue
up front for a half while between foes and weakened. AND CHANGE squeezed at the break to be away slowly, raced back and three wide through the turn,
improved position without posing a serious threat. LINNIE MAE away in good order, showed the way up the backstretch inside, narrower advantage through
the turn, gave way when headed entering the stretch. GLOBAL RISK remained back in failing to menace. GOGO BOBBYJO tired from her early efforts.
FABULOUS TALE broke out, remained always back. SCAMPERING MA'AM broke in to tighten up inner foe, steadily faded.

Footnotes
SPEIGHT AND MALICE in the second flight while between horses, roused into the stretch, kicked down the leader with good resolve to be in time. MONEY
RUN broke alertly, soon cleared toward the inside, extended advantage through the turn, still well clear past the furlong marker, could not contain the
winner, held sway for the place. COUNT DE MONET in tight and forced to steady just after the start, trailed for a half as a result, fanned six wide into the
stretch, displayed some belated interest down the center of the strip to better his position. PRESSURE in the flight group while inside, steered out a bit
inside the furlong ground, went eveny to the wire. SHADY EMPIRE lacked speed, saved ground turn, inside several rivals to improve into the lane, flattened
out the final furlong. DEFLATER void of speed, two path through the turn, moved toward the inside in upper stretch,improved slightly while not a serious
threat. CIRCLE BACK JACK within striking distance while widest early, six path far turn, five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. MEAN JAKEY
four wide and between horses when with the second group into the turn, three wide exiting, had little left for the run to the wire. HI YAH brushed just after
the start, moved out, five wide into the turn, also tired down the lane. UPSTRIKER three wide and between horses for a half, backed up through the stretch
as well.

Footnotes
HAULIN ICE stalked the pace while off the inside, closer three wide turning for home, bid nearing midstretch between horses, took over, held the runner up
safe late under firm handling. HUSH IT HONEY raced back off the pace and the inside, closer four wide exiting the turn, slowly closing the gap on the
winner late while well clear for the place. HERE U COME AGAIN away in good order, narrowly set the pace off the inside, continued to duel through the
turn, larger lead entering the stretch, briefly raced on equal terms inside the winner approaching midstretch then could not keep up or contain the runner up,
lasted for the show. FREEBURN in the second flight while between foes, lacked a winning response in the drive to finish up evenly. FLOWER MOUND went
one paced throughout while racing toward the inside. TAPITURE'S LADY last to leave, trailed for a half, swung out five wide into the lane, displayed a mild
amount of late interest to better position. AFFECTION lacked early foot, came three wide for the drive, improved slightly while never a potent threat. SPIN
THE BREEZE remained back while three to four wide through the turn, failed to rally. BEST CUPCAKE dueled up front inside, gave way late in the turn.
SHY SHY remained always back.

Footnotes
KANTEX outrun in the early going, crept a bit closer while in traffic far turn, stalled a bit then steered out four wide for room while being asked, came three
wide for the drive, engaged the leader with less than a furlong remaining, wore that one down to be edging clear late. BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO cleared to
the inside from the three path early in the first turn, set a lively set of fractions toward the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the stretch,
responded briefly when the winner came calling inside the furlong marker then could not keep up, remained clear for the place. SULWE lacked early foot,
continued back up the backstretch, angled five wide turning for home, lugged out when advancing inside the furlong marker, up for the show, no threat to
the top pair. MOZINGO chased the runner up throughout from along the inside, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly, lost the show late. PUNCHY
GIRL in the second flight while racing three wide much of the way, also came up empty for the stretch run. CASHMERE BABY went one paced while racing
three wide. LASSIE MY GIRL in the second flight while between horses, began to weaken after five furlongs. KABOOM BABY off step slow, four wide
through the first turn when well off the pace, three wide second bend, lacked response. COURTNEY FAY hesitated at the start, trailed most of the way and
was never a threat. RIVERCREST GIRL was always outrun.

Footnotes
LADY WOOPIG void of any early foot toward the inside, continued back the middle half mile, angled out sharply to be five then six wide into the lane, quickly
collared the leader by sweeping by, strongly. ARR PIRATETREASURE prompted the leader from the outside, took over second turn, clear into the stretch,
proved no match for the winner while holding sway for the place spot late. PNEUMA back off the pace while saving ground, continued inside and improved
into the stretch, slowly getting to the runner up while remaining along the inside. ARDEN AR settled off the pace and the inside in the three path first turn,
continued off the rail, four path second turn when moving closer, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. KAVA bumped at the break to be off slowly,
raced back, saved ground second turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. PRINCIPAL ANITA broke in, bumped KAVA, was straightened
and raced well back, three wide into the far turn, carried out six wide by the winner turning for home, improved a bit while remaining well out in the strip.
CHUCK WILLS WIDOW four wide into the first turn, continued to race forwardly up the backstretch, had little left for the stretch run. MY JULIA showed the
way into the first turn, set a pressured pace the next five furlongs, weakened when headed final turn. QUEEN WILHELMINA five wide into the first turn,
remained back, failed to rally. PRESLEYS TURN was finished after five furlongs. ARIEL M D forwardly placed for five furlongs, backed up. APRIL FLOWER
BOUND rank, checked up behind horses into the first turn, remained always back.
