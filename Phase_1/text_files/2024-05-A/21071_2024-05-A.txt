Footnotes
XY FACE vied for the lead in the two path, was nudged along around the turn, inched clear while floating out to the five path in upper stretch, and held sway.
ZAINO had a slow start, raced wellback in the four path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, and rallied on his left lead for place. YASUR
dueled with the inner eventual winner from the four path before merging into the three path entering the turn, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch,
and finished evenly for show. JAKE'S AFFECTION bumped with an inner foe at the start, was hustled in midpack from the three path but made no impact.
BLACK ECHO stalked inside but flattened in the three path down the lane. GOWOKEGOBROKE chased in the five path but faded in the stretch. NOT A
PRAYER bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path and never menaced. MR. LEFTY tracked in the two path but backed up around the
turn.

Footnotes
CHARGE OFF set a rated pace along the rail and widened under a drive. REMERTON prompted the winner two wide and was clearly second best.
ATOMICO stalked the pace three wide, lacked the needed rally but held clear of the rest. RAGMAN appeared to clip heels midway around the first turn,
raced two wide around the turns and never threatened. CASTLE BORN steadied midway around the first turn, raced three wide and was never a factor.
NOBLE HERO was keen inside early and had no response around the far turn.

AWESOME WIND set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. SIR BANANA BRIAN raced off the early pace, advanced three wide around
the turn and was second best in the lane. MISTER COOPER was off slowly, raced off the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and ran on
for the show. BERNARDO'S LEGACY bumped just after the start, raced three wide and went evenly. VINICIO steadied to avoid the fallen rider soon after
the start, saved ground and never threatened. NIPPON chased the pace from the rail and faltered in the lane. VITO'S BROTHER had only brief speed
inside. EL BAILADOR was bumped just after the start, lost the rider, galloped along with the field and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
SALS DREAM GIRL tracked in the three path, ranged up to bid in the four path midway around the far turn, dueled with the inner pacesetter into the final
furlong, bumped with that foe just after the sixteenth, and inched away in the closing stages. WORLDLY BEAUTY set the pace in the three path, was cued
in the two path midway around the far turn, dug in while dueling with an outer foe entering the stretch, drifted out slightly to bump with that foe just after the
sixteenth, and was edged out late to place. HARLAN'S LEGACY stalked in the two path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, fanned out to the
nine path at the top of the lane, and ran on while on her left lead for show. PACIFIC PRINCESS laid up close in the four path, was driven between foes in
the three path around the far turn, but finished evenly in the seven path down the lane. DON'T GET PICKLED rated in the two path but never threatened.
KRABI trailed inside, moved up along the rail passing the half, but was empty entering the stretch.

EMBRACE THE DREAM pressed the from the rail, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. FASTEST broke through the starting gate just after
a neighbor did but never escaped the grasp of the assistant starter, set the pace two wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane and was
clearly second best. ZACK'S MYSTERIO pressed the pace three wide, was no match for the top two in the lane but lasted for the show. BOY O' BOY saved
ground and failed to menace. STAR OF THE BEAST was outrun while racing two wide around the turn and swinging five wide in upper stretch. D FLASH
chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.

OLGA set a clear pace along the rail and held clear under a drive. EUPHIMA (ARG) chased the winner two wide in the clear, made some progress in upper
stretch but was no match in the final furlong while holding for the place. MAMA MARIA raced off the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in
the lane and had a mild stretch gain. MISS UCRANIA lacked speed while racing two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and was no threat.
MARTHAMAYWHOVIER was outrun inside. CORINTH played no factor while racing three wide.

wire by an outer foe to place. TALKIN TIPSY pressed in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and kept on
for show. DAVID'S ROSE bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace inside but finished evenly from the two path in the stretch. MISTICA
