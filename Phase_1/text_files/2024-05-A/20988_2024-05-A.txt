HADLEY'S MAX pressed the pace outside of the leader, bid at the three-eighths pole and was clear in the stretch under steady urging. MEDAL OF VALOR
was unrushed early, raced well back, then rallied along the rail through the stretch, almost running out of his hair. BUCKLE UP bid in the four path and
gained the show spot late. PAIGE PERFECT was clear early, was caught by the winner at the three-eighths pole and gave way through the stretch. NO
MANCHES raced evenly. MY MISTER PERFECT and BOZAANO stalked the pace outside and gave way in the stretch. CHARMING VICTORY was not a
factor, and was eased late. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

Footnotes
MY BARILEY was steadied and shuffled back early, saved ground, angled five wide at the top of the stretch and rallied, dueling to the wire. HEMP HEAVEN
bid at the three-eighths pole, bid, vied outside, then dueled late to the wire and was outfinished. LUCK OF THE DRAW stalked the pace in the three path,
bid at the half-mile pole, vied and was no match. ILLINI pressed the pace in the two path, bid at the half-mile pole, vied and was not a match. PADDY'S
HOUSE raced well back, then passed tired horses. J W RUCKUS vied inside to the eighth pole and gave way. SILENT SONATA was through early. This
race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
