Footnotes
LAWS OF MAN tracked the leader three or four wide to bid and edge clear in the far turn, was roused briefly upper stretch and drew off. HOG HEAVEN
showed the most early speed along the inside to make the pace to the far turn, shifted outside the winner into the lane and was clearly best of the others.
TAPITBOY tracked the pace from three wide and weakened. BIG AND BOLD was not a threat along the inside. LEGACYINTHEMAKING was always back.
LAST STAND was four to six wide through the first turn, bore out going up the backstretch and dropped out.

GOIN OWEN was angled out turning into the backstretch while never far back, bid four wide through the far turn and moved off under steady handling.
GAME'S KARTEL dueled on the pace outside WILLHE LOVE to the far turn then could not go with the winner in the drive while just holding the place late.
WILLHE LOVE dueled from inside GAME'S KARTEL on the pace to the far turn, continued into the lane but was outnodded for the place.
THUNDERSTORMACOMIN moved up inside while not a threat. TIZ RED TIME stalked the pace three or four wide and weakened. BUY NOW was not a
factor.

FULL SPIRIT stalked the early leaders three and four wide to bid through the far turn then showed in front turning for home and moved off under urging.
LAYAWAY angled out going up the backstretch to move three and four wide, was steadied through midstretch as a rival came out and just gained the place
late. FIRENSPICE showed speed three wide then moved in going to the far turn, went in and then out through midstretch and lost the place on the wire. I
THINK I KNOW YOU lacked a solid closing bid from four wide. CANARY NATION was not a threat. HIGHLANDER'S EDGE showed some early speed and
weakened along the inside.

SHOTCRETE dueled on the early pace inside WANTABE to edge clear nearing the lane then shied out late while holding a clear margin. MISTER LESTER
settled in reach of the early pace three or four wide and rallied in the lane but could not threaten the winner. DUTTON'S REVENGE stalked the pace three
wide, bid into the far turn and could not sustain the run. PROOF OF PURCHASE stalked the pace from four wide and weakened. WANTABE dueled on the
early pace outside the winner and weakened through the lane. DONNY'S GOT GAME saved ground and was always back.
