BUSKER ALLIE advanced on the backside surging along the inside on the far turn to draw even at the quarter pole clearing in upper stretch drawing off
under urging. WATERWORKS gained on the backside pressing to even terms at the quarter pole ceding to rival in upper stretch proving second best late.
JAMMERS REVENGE pressed early then dropped off the leaders on the backside racing evenly on the far turn then through the lane to best the others.
BANDEENA tracked the early pace fading on the far turn mustering enough to outbid a few down the lane. HUMMIN' THE FUNK slow early played no
factor. NEVER TELL PATTI pressed to lead at the half being hooked outside the quarter pole giving way the final eighth. IRON BERTIE pressed on the
early pace would fade on the far turn. UNCAPTURED FAITH was eased in upper stretch making the wire walking off after the race.

on the turn widening in upper stretch digging in late ceding to outside pressure. HERE COMES LOVIE pressed chased on the turn extending in upper
stretch finishing evenly. SHALL RETURN hustled along chased through the turn into upper stretch weakening under a drive. WAY TO FIRE pressed the
pace being passed on the turn tiring the final eighth. LAUGH IT OFF played no factor. SUPER DONNA G gave way on the turn. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK
faded on the turn. ANCIENT BROWN trailed throughout. PER RULING #43 FROM WEST VIRGINIA RACING COMMISSION, YESTERDAYSPLAN WAS
