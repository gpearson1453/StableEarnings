Footnotes
DA CANDY CANE led around the first turn, vied inside, was in tight quarters late and proved best in a long drive. LA PARADISO JORDAN moved up along
the backstretch to vie for the lead, came in late to be in tight quarters and was outfinished in a game effort. ENDLESS GRACE was reluctant to load, raced
close to the pace along the inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, bid, hung late and settled for show. CAT TALE SKY raced mid pack and improved
position in a steady effort. VA VOOM stalked the pace while racing outside, had little left for the drive and fell back. CAMS HOTROD failed to contend in an
outside trip and was not urged late. UNITED SISTER showed little and was not urged in the stretch.

MULBERRY STREET hopped at the start to be off slowly, was unhurried early, moved up on the backstretch to stalk the pace, challenged for the lead
entering the stretch and drew off. ROYALLY got away well, was never far off the pace while racing outside, rallied around the turn, bid six wide and closed
to get up for place while no threat to the winner. JACKS SPRING BREAK stalked the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, bid along the rail and
was caught for second. ONCE UPON A DREAM raced close to the pace, raced five wide along the backstretch, bid and had little left for the drive. UNITED
PATRIOT set a pressured pace, weakened in the drive and faded through the stretch. GUINESSEY pressed the pace two across, challenged for the lead on
the turn and gave way. TWITTY CITY showed speed to the second turn and tired.

NUMBER ONE DUDE raced in the second flight two across, shifted out on the turn, bid willingly, assumed command near the eighth pole, inched away and
just lasted. KALEO bumped mildly at the start, raced mid pack, rallied around the turn, closed willingly, was gaining fast late and just missed at the wire. C
W PRIZE raced in the second flight along the inside, angled out on the turn, bid between horses, was impeded and checked near the eighth pole, altered
course, came again and was gaining late. SWEET MEDICINE was unhurried early in an outside trip, was roused at the top of the lane, closed well and was
gaining ground. KWONTRO vied two across to the second turn, drew clear and was outclosed. BRIGGSEY vied inside to the second turn, fell back and was
squeezed along the rail while tiring. THAT'S SOMETHING bumped mildly at the start, was unhurried early, moved up inside to the turn, swung wide and
lacked a bid. The rider of C W PRIZE lodged an objection against the rider of NUMBER ONE DUDE for alleged interference near the eighth pole. No
change was made.

Footnotes
SHOOTIN RUN advanced inside on the turn, awaited room, got through along the rail, closed willingly and drew clear late. GOOD LIQUOR was away
alertly, pressed the pace to the turn, assumed command, drew clear and was outclosed to finish second best. O S U BUDKE bumped at the start, raced in
close between horses, was checked entering the turn, fell back, continued willingly and finished with good energy to earn show. AUNT KENDRA broke in
and bumped at the start, was never far back while racing outside, put in a steady effort and didn't have enough late. GOSPEL EXTRA set a pressured pace,
was headed on the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. TWO RIVERS broke in and bumped at the start, went widest in the drive and finished
well. LADY RASHEN bumped at the start, raced close to the pace along the inside, was checked entering the turn and dropped back. COIN PURSE stalked
the pace, challenged three across on the turn, fell back, swung wide and faded. DA LAST TEQUILA stalked the pace between horses, fell back into the turn
and went evenly thereafter. SWEET THELMA JEAN hesitated at the start, raced outside and was outrun. LITTLE MO BROWN bumped at the start, was
taken outside and failed to contend.
