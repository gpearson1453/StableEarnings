Footnotes
INDIANQUEST broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three wide coming under a drive at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying in tandem with ERIC FROM MIAMI, came in under right handed crop and traded leans with that rival inside the
final forty yards and was just up by a nostril to prevail on the wire. ERIC FROM MIAMI chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied in concert with the aforementioned foe, took command forty yards from home, came out under
a left handed crop and traded leans with that rival, then got nailed on the line. AVA'S UNCLE BILLY coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of ROCK STAR
BOY, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and fought on to the finish to preserve the show honors. ROCK
STAR BOY coaxed from the start, led early on before knocking heads with AVA'S UNCLE BILLY when three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BROWN DON'T STOP chased five then four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, offered no response. GUM ISLAND brushed the near side stall at the start getting away
near the rear of the field, chased just off the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing midway on the turn, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and trailed. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of ERIC FROM MIAMI alleging interference against INDIANQUEST in
deep stretch. After review, the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
MAGGIE T was well rated while racing in the two path behind the front runners, split rivals leaving the bend and had a long drive with ARGENTINA GIRL
through the final furlong and got up late under left handed crop urging while drifting out slightly in the final sixteenth. ARGENTINA GIRL was away alertly
and vied for the lead three wide, made a bid off the turn to gain a short advantage, then had a long drive with the winner and drifted out slightly in the final
sixteenth under right handed crop urging but was out-kicked late in a game effort. TRY IT AGAIN vied for the lead on the inside and faded in the final
furlong, bested the rest. SHOOPTHEREITIS prompted the pace four wide and weakened in the lane. SYNONYMOUS chased the early pace on the outside,
then settled and shift in entering the far turn to be three wide and tired. I FEEL THE NEED was off a step slow and had no early speed, swung out five wide
leaving the turn and was not a threat. STRANGE FRUIT tracked the early pace in between rivals, then shifted to the outside nearing the three eighths
marker and came seven wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
ROTKNEE coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed along the inside advancing to take command near the nine-sixteenths, faced some pressure from
EXCELLENT TIMING to the outside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under
a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish kept to task. SHERIFF BIANCO hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to chase the winner home while clear for the place honors.
DONEGAL SURGES coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing half a mile from home, tipped three wide at the top of the stretch,
offered up a mild bid. EXCELLENT TIMING struck the near side stall at the start but established the front regardless, showed the way four paths off the
inside early on before being engaged and then displaced from command by the eventual winner with nine-sixteenths to run, prompted that rival from the
outside four then three wide, swung four wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off, then weakened in the final furlong. THRILL OF IT chased
four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide
into upper stretch and made no headway.

GUN MAESTRO vied for the lead on the outside, made a four wide bid off the turn to shake clear, then widened the margin by the furlong marker and was
given one left handed reminer inside the sixteenth marker to remain clear to the wire to prove best. SONDSLIKSOMDINIDDO pressed the pace on the
inside and then moved up to vie for the lead on the rail, could not go with the winner while keeping on willingly to be second best. PAPI ON ICE was settled
early, saved ground on the turn, came three wide off the bend, then moved out by the furlong marker and had a mild late rally. I LOVE CARA was settled
early, three wide on the turn, came five wide off the bend and offered a belated rally but needed more. BINGOOD TO KNOWYA vied for the lead in between
rivals and weakened in the dfrive. SCOTTO raced outside early, then moved in to be three wide entering the far turn, moved to the inside on the turn and
was not a threat.

Footnotes
REALLY GOOD broke in at the start bumping DAUNT twice before being corrected off, tracked along the inside and then just off the inside from near the
rear of the field, tucked back inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to get up in the final jumps to the finish and prevail. BEUYS (IRE) along the inside through the first turn, tracked the front just off the inside from just
off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four then three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in
under threat and was caught in the final strides to the wire. MONDEGO (GB) coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through
moderate splits under some pressure from DAUNT to the outside, had that rival get active into the far turn and matched strides coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch headed for the front, dug in under a drive running on to preserve the place honors on the wire when just
besting his main pace rival. DAUNT got bumped at the start by REALLY GOOD, who broke inwards, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside two
to three wide, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking narrow command, got displaced by BEUYS near
the eighth pole, ran on under a drive to the finish getting outfinished in the late stages. AGENT CREED coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the
inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch, made no late headway. BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES chased two
to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch, and trailed throughout.

BOURBON CALLING stalked the pace vfrom the outside, made a four wide bid when ready nearing the quarter pole, then took over leaving the turn and
drew away in the final furlong to prove much the best. SIX PERCENT chased the pace from between rivals, two wide on the turn, then finished willingly to
gain the place award while no match to the winner. BOLD VICTORY chased the early pace five wide, then settled four wide on the turn, came seven wide
off the turn and improved position finishing with best stride late. GUT FEELING chased the early pace from the outside, made a five wide bid by the quarter
pole but flattened out the final furlong. HIGH HEAT set a pressured pace early on the inside, then shook clear till being headed nearing the quarter pole and
then weakened the final furlong. HOLDTHEFLIGHT pressed the early pace three wide, then tracked the pace from between rivals on the turn and weakened
in the drive. WILD BANKER was bumped at the break, then rushed up the inside and tired.

clear under a drive kept to task. JACKSON HEIGHTS got bumped at the start and forced to steady out when his lane was taken over by AULA due to
pressure from BOYS CODE and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside at the tail of the field early on,
came under coaxing tucked inside at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and kicked on belatedly to show good courage to secure the place
honors. SAINT GAUDENS coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, offered up a bid spinning five wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and flattened out in the late stages while clear for the show honors. BOYS CODE broke out at the start bumping
AULA into JACKSON HEIGHTS forcing that foe to steady, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then five to six wide through the turn coaxed
along from midway, swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to the finish. AULA got bumped at the start by BOYS CODE and in
turn bumped the front of JACKSON HEIGHTS before taking over that rival's lane forcing him to steady off his heels, raced just off the inside forwardly
placed early on before taking over command inside six furlongs to run, showed the way into the far turn tucking to the inside, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths under threat, cut the corner having yielded command and weakened to the finish. BATTLEOFLEXINGTON chased five wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, tipped six wide into upper stretch, tired. MESSI THE MAGICIAN showed the way early on before being displaced by AULA on the
front, raced four then three wide in close aim, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
MARCO T. was well rated along the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and came four wide off the turn to make a bid, was clear by the sixteenth marker
and drew away to prove best under a drive. PRIVATE PROPERTY (IRE) settled early and angled in nearing the far turn and was two wide on the turn,
swung out six wide leaving the turn and finished well. GROWTH RATE was settled on the inside, then clipped heels with PRIVATE PROPERTY and
bobbled nearing the three eights marker, then got back into stride while still on the inside, moved out in the lane and rallied well late. OCEAN MERMAID
(GB) set a pressured pace on the inside, then shook clear leaving the turn but weakened in the final sixteenth. PARADE RING (IRE) pressed the pace and
made a two wide bid on the turn to go on even terms nearing the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. IZZY SWEET GIRL (IRE) stalked the early pace
three wide, then tracked the leaders two wide and then on the inside by the quarter pole but faded in gthe drive. AWATEA was off a step slow, then moved
up in the three path, then had to alter course to the outside by the seven sixteenths, came six wide off the turn and had no rally. BELLIQUEUX was off a
step slow, settled in the back and lacked a serious rally. CLASSIC CARA was reserved early and failed to menace. BEWILDERED stalked the pace four
wide and came five wide off the turn, then moved in by the furlong marker and tired. AZTECA STARDUST was reserved early and had no response.
