Footnotes
BEST SELLER dictated terms in the two path via an uncontested advantage, was let out turning for home as an outer foe gave chase, dug in to resist that
rival's challenge in the final furlong and held firm. WINDY BAY laid close up along the inside backing off to stalk around the first turn, took aim outside of the
leader around the far turn, chased that one while lacking progress in upper stretch, yet sustained her grinding charge to bid in the final furlong, but was kept
at bay. DIVINELY BOLT broke a step slow and was last away, raced off of the pace along the inside, improved two wide around the far turn, drifted out to
the six path pursuing the top pair in upper stretch and was best of the rest. LADY MERCEDES pursued from midpack tucking from the two path to the rail
around the first turn, chased the top pair around the far turn and failed to menace. CANT KEEP ME DOWN raced towards the rear in the two path and made
little impact. ALAMO broke outwardly, stalked the leader from the three path, but weakened approaching the far turn.

Footnotes
GREAT RICHIE M tracked in the four path before advancing to bid at the three furlong pole, forged a narrow advantage from the leader tucking to the three
path turning for home, shifted out to meet an outer challenge in midstretch and repelled that bidder in the final furlong. SIR GREYLIND stalked the leader
from the three path, got outmoved by an outer bidder nearing the three furlong pole, chased the top pair from the four path turning for home, took aim
outside of them in upper stretch, attempted a bid at the furlong grounds but was turned away in the late stages. B FIFTY TWO broke a beat slow, raced off
of the pace in the four to three path, then ran on willingly to gain show late. FOR SOME REASON showed the way in the two path, met an outer challenge
into the turn before getting headed by that one with five sixteenths to go, fought on through upper stretch but gave way at the furlong grounds. BAYTOWN
BRUISER brushed an outer rival at the start, then saved ground off of the pace to no avail. MIDNIGHT STORMY hopped slightly and bobbled briefly upon
leaving the gates, raced at the rear in the five to four path and made little impact. BADLANDS RULER broke a step slow and took contact from an inner rival
at the start, chased forwardly along the inside, sustained pursuit from midpack in the four path around the turn, drifted to the six path entering the lane and
tired.

Footnotes
AUSTIN CRUISE stalked along the inside, surpassed an inner faltering rival while taking aim inside of the leader entering upper stretch, bid in the final
furlong, edged past at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. THE TONER vied for the lead with an inner rival and in the three path into the turn, led turning for
home, cleared entering the lane, but was caught by an inner bidder with a sixteenth to go. MO HAIR SAM stalked three to two wide into the turn, pursued
three wide entering the lane and chased the top pair home willingly. SERGEANT CAPPS raced forwardly two wide, got subtly shuffled into the turn before
chasing from the three path around the bend, then stayed on for a minor share. SACKETT broke out and bumped a rival at the start, lacked early speed
despite rider's urging, took the turn in the two path, shfited to the four path in upper stretch and moved up between horses late. REB hopped at the start and
broke multiple lengths slow, raced well back three wide, shifted to the six path in upper stretch and improved position. FINANCIAL WHIZ raced off of the
pace in the four to five path and and failed to menace. SWEET FANTASY broke outwardly while off slow, recovered to track in the four path into the turn,
but lugged inwardly behind the leaders in upper stretch and readily weakened. TAB WALKER made little impact two wide. AMERICAN CITY shied from a
strong use of a right handed crop soon after the start, raced at the rear along the inside, was outrun then altered course late. REPEATINGOFCOURSE was
bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside and tired. BAYTOWN SUNDANCE was hustled to vie along the inside, got
headed by an outer counterpart turning for home, gave way while shying greenly from rider's restraint to avoid contacting the inner rail entering the lane and
caved.

Footnotes
PIN UP BETTY pursued from midpack in the two to three path, tracked before ranging up three wide around the far turn, bid and gained an advantage
entering the lane in the four path then drove clear. RACONTEUSE stalked in the three to two path and behind the leaders around the first turn, came under
rousing while getting out moved by an outer bidder around the far turn, got floated to the four path as the leader kicked clear in upper stretch, then ran on to
reach place in the final sixteenth. MOONLIGHT GAMBLER settled well back along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before swinging to the six
path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly to edge show late. RESTLESS DREAMER prompted outside of the leader and from the four to three path into
the backstretch, vied in the two path around the far turn, but was no match for an outer bidder entering the lane, faded and relinquished minor placings late.
BLAME THE GELATO stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path and between horses entering upper stretch, but only managed to chase before
yielding. HIDDEN PRESENCE lacked speed two wide, took closer order before pursuing three wide around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the
lane and failed to menace between horses. DIANTHUS was eased back between horses passing the wire for the first time, laid off of the pace in the three
path, failed to sustain position down the backstretch, raced at the rear turning for home and failed to factor. SICILIAN PRINCESS led from an outer presser
down the backstretch, vied with that one around the far turn, then weakened inside of a pair of rivals entering upper stretch. CAPO DONNA saved ground
off of the pace and tired. HAMPTON YARD was keen between horses while at the rear in the two path early on, then got outrun.

Footnotes
ABADIN showed the way inside of a prompting rival, dug in sparring with that one through the final furlong and held firm. TIGER'S LEGACY prompted
outside of the eventual winner, dueled with that one through the final furlong but was kept at bay. ASMODEUS stalked forwardly in the three to four path,
and ran on to be best of the rest. BRAZEN BOY exchanged bumps with an outer rival at the start, recovered to stalk along the inside, pursued from the two
to three path around the turn, but lacked a bid and gave way. EPIC BATTLE traded bumps with an inner rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace and
improved inside of rivals. ICEATUDE lacked speed in the four to five path and moved up mildly. OVERBORE chased from midpack in the three path, shifted
to the five path in upper stretch and tired. ONE RED CENT was outrun throughout.

LIPS SAY BLISS pressed outside of the leader, vied in the three path around the far turn, then drew off under a drive. HAROLD'S CLOUD stalked along the
inside, pursued from the pocket a path off the inside around the far turn, tipped to the three path entering the lane, bid for place in pursuit of the clearing
leader in upper stretch, dueled for that position and prevailed. MONTEVALLO showed the way inside of a pressing foe into the backstretch, vied with that
one around the far turn, proved no match entering upper stretch, dueled for place with an outer bidder through midstretch but was bested late. WINSTON
WOLF tracked three wide, was roused in range in the four path around the far turn, but only managed to chase while hanging on his left lead and lacked a
bid. PANDO tugged keenly in midpack two wide and between horses into and around the first turn, chased from the two path around the far turn and failed
to menace. KNOX laid off of the pace three to four wide and failed to factor. TAGLIATELLE broke a step slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted
off of the rail around the far turn before swinging to the five path entering the lane, but made little impact. LAUGHINALLTHEWAY broke a beat slow, trailed
along the inside before shifting out to the six path entering the backstretch, then trailed in the two path around the far turn and got outrun. BOBWHITE
BOBBY settled off of the pace four wide, came under a drive in the three path into the far turn and tired.

CHASING THE CROWN tracked in the three path, ranged up three deep to bid in hand entering the lane, gained an advantage entering upper stretch and
drove clear at the furlong grounds. CAMP HOPE stalked two wide, bid along with an outer rival nearing the lane, vied with that one before getting outkicked
entering the final furlong and was second best. JOHNY'S FIREBALL settled well back along the inside, took the far turn in the three path before shifting to
the five path in upper stretch, then stayed on willingly to edge show late. SANTORINI showed the way along the inside, met a pair of outer bids nearing the
lane, got headed entering it and faded in midstretch. EVAN HARLAN tracked along the inside, chased in the two path around the far turn, tipped further out
in upper stretch and lacked a bid. EL KABONG laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, checked when an inner rival shifted across
his path with nine sixteenths to go, brushed with an inner rival two wide around the far turn, moved between horses nearing the lane then lacked a rally
among foes. BAY STREET MONEY settled off of the pace two wide, brushed with an outer rival while tucking to the inside around the far turn, but only
managed to chase in upper stretch before yielding. FORT WASHINGTON bobbled a the start and was slow into stride, trailed in the two path and never got
involved. DUBYUHNELL saved ground off of the pace and faded turning for home. NATIVE THUNDER tugged between horses early on, checked pursuing
from midpack in the two path around the first turn, shfited out four wide with nine sixteenths to go, chased around the far turn, but weakened while drifting
out entering the lane.

Footnotes
READY FOR TROUBLE laid off of the pace in the three path, awaited racing room behind foes entering the lane, tipped four wide in upper stretch and
rallied to drive past the leader late. HIGH FASHION KATE led two wide before clearing to the inside entering the turn, shook free of an outer presser
entering upper stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth. SPIRITUAL LADY tracked along the inside, awaited racing room in the two to three path around
the turn, split foes three wide entering the lane to take aim on the leader in upper stretch, but was outkicked for place at the sixteenth pole and held show.
KRICKLE broke out while off sharply, prompted inside of the leader while under strong restraint, was wrangled back to stalk along the inside approaching
the turn, but only managed to chase through the lane and lacked a bid. BETTE DAVIS broke a step slow and brushed with an inner foe at the start, laid off
of the pace along the inside, shifted to the two path entering the lane, then the three path in midstretch and improved position. MILA JUNES stalked three to
two wide into the turn, chased between horses in upper stretch and yielded. WINDY WALK brushed with an outer foe while off a beat slow, trailed in the four
to six path and made little impact. QUEEN'S NOTICE tracked in the four to five path and weakened.
