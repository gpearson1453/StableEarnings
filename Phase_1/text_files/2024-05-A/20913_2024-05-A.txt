rallied up the rail to take the lead nearing the eighth pole, and dug in to hold off an outer foe. BILLY THE GREEK got bumped at the start by inner foe into
an outer foe, rated in the two path, was cued approaching the far turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. BAYTOWN
PARFAIT showed the way in the two path, was roused into the far turn, lost the lead from the three path in upper stretch, but dug in to hold show.
LIKEBELIVINGNMAGIC broke out and bumped an outer foe, prompted the pace in the four path, bid two wide around the far turn, swung from the four path
into the stretch, but faded late. HOT N LUCKY tracked in the four path, was coaxed from the two path midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path
at the top of the stretch, and flattened. LASSO raced wellback in the three path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, but failed to menace.

AWESOME TRAIN saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed outside and drew off through the final sixteenth. CAJUN FOOL
pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and was clearly second best late. KALIMAN set the pace in
the two path, weakened in the lane but kept on well enough to hold the show. TEAM TRAVIS chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. UZZIAH was
outrun inside. UNSPOKEN REQUEST was hustled along four wide but steadily faded.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTES ROAD prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path passing the quarter, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane, and
inched ahead of the inner pacesetter through the final furlong. RAPID TULA showed the way in the three path, was cued while off the rail passing the
quarter, tipped back out to the three path entering the stretch, and ran on but was edged out through the final furlong by an outer foe to place.
UNCAPTURED DOVE stalked inside, was ridden along the rail around the turn, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. MISS
BIA rated in the three path, received a right handed cue in the two path passing the quarter, but finished evenly. CASTLE BORN trailed in the two path and
did not factor from the four path down the lane. BABY BLOCKS tracked in the two path, angled out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but flattened.
BROWN EYED BEAUTY chased in the four path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the stretch, but failed to menace.

THE HONEYMAN settled off the pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide between foes around the far turn, angled five wide to split rivals near
the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. T B TWELVE ALWAYS stalked
the pace two wide, bid between foes in midstretch and kept on to be second best late. HEATHCLIFF raced in range three wide, bid three wide nearing the
quarter pole, vied between foes in the lane and was outfinished late. KARAOKE raced off the pace three and four wide and had a mild rally. MIRACLE TRIP
set the pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened. DESIGNATED HITTER broke outwardly and soundly bumped KHOPESH, trailed inside, advanced
five and six wide around the far turn and flattened out in the final furlong. NOBLE STAR pressed the pace two wide and tired in the lane. KHOPESH was
bumped hard at the start, saved ground off the pace and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
SUDOKU TERRY trailed in the two path, steadied between foes going into the turn, came under right handed encouragement in the five path midway
around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the lane, rallied outside of foes while tipping inwards, and got up in the final strides. STAR
PERFORMANCE laid up close in the four path, bid in the three path midway around the turn, took the lead passing the quarter, swung out to the six path at
the top of the stretch, but drifted in, and was caught late by an outer foe to place. BLUE TOPAZ stalked in the two path, was cued midway around the turn,
tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, angled inwards to avoid the drifting outer leader, and kept on for show. STARLIT SOFI got bumped at the
start by an outer foe, raced off the pace in the three path, was driven in the four path around the turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and
stayed on. HAPPY BEACH bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path but flattened from the rail in the stretch. CAIRNHILL bumped with
an outer foe at the start, rated inside, but steadied going into the turn, and made no impact. LIGHTNING DUST bumped an inner foe at the start, set the
pace in the two path, but lost the lead passing the quarter, and yielded. INFINIOUS tracked in the five path but was empty entering the stretch.
