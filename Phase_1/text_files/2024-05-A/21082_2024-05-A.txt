Footnotes
FINAL BOSS cleared and crossed over quickly, pressured from outside around the first turn, inched clear on the backstretch, pressured again by GROGU
into the far turn, put that rival away on the far turn, asked right handed in upper stretch, met a pair of bids with a furlong left to run and edged clear once
more in a game effort. MOONLIT SONATA stalked the pace from the fence, waited behind the leader on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch and
launched a bid between rivals, could not find the needed late kick to overtake the winner but stayed on to hold second. EL REY REY unhurried in the
beginning and moved inside, came off the rail a bit leaving the clubhouse turn, trailed two wide leaving the backstretch, shifted out and was on the move
three deep around the far turn, bid three deep at the eighth pole, lacked late punch and got edged for second. JACK KEROUAC settled off the pace and
moved inside, shifted to the two path on the clubhouse turn and moved closer, chased out of range into the far turn, roused in the two path but lacked room
behind a trio of rivals approaching the stretch, angled out into the clear and had little left for the drive. GROGU stalked outside a rival then tugged the rider
forward and applied pressure to the leader from outside, lost touch with the pacesetter on the backstretch, reengaged into the far turn, lost touch around that
bend and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
TIMTY chased three wide into the turn, bid two wide around the bend, took over three wide into the stretch, put away inner rival at the eighth pole, grew a bit
weary late but managed to hold on. IVAN THE GREAT broke well, chased off the inside, went two wide into the turn, drifted out around the bend, continued
give chase while racing greenly in the drive, surged late from outside and missed. SOI NGERN took control from inside, pressured by the winner around the
bend, lost command while in the two path entering the stretch, could not keep touch with TIMTY with a furlong remaining, churned on late and saved third.
EL ONDEADO hustled early, chased off the rail, dove down to the rail early on the turn, saved ground to the stretch, remained on the fence in the lane, kept
on through the late stages and missed third. SIR BLACK SHADOW was off a bit slow to begin and lacked early speed, trailed on the inside then a bit off the
rail into the lane and was never a factor.

Footnotes
FLAVIUS settled in the two path, drew closer while tipping three wide on the far turn, confronted the top pair from outside at the eighth pole and proved best
in the final sixteenth. MARKS HIP took control early outside a rival then cleared into the backstretch, moved over to the rail, challenged by SO I'M TOLD into
the stretch, maintained a short lead into the final furlong then fought inside a pair of rivals with a sixteenth remaining and yielded grudgingly. SO I'M TOLD
raced up close from inside then drifted out a bit around the clubhouse turn and was taken in hand ceding control to MARKS HIP, was closest in pursuit up
the backstretch, chased on the rail then shifted out to the two path, drew alongside the leader entering the stretch, fought between rivals in the furlong
grounds and faltered late. SILARDI stalked three wide early, moved into the two path on the backstretch, chased between rivals at the quarter pole and
flattened in the late stages. MYNUMEROUNO (AUS) pulled and was a bit rank from inside early, came off the rail a bit around the clubhouse turn, saved
ground through the second bend and weakened.

Footnotes
TAPALO sped clear and showed the way in the early going, led two to three wide around the turn, drifted out at the top of the stretch, continued to drift a bit
more while increasing the lead and was ridden out to the wire. BALL DON'T LIE stalked TAPALO up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, moved
out to the four path and came under a ride, asked right handed at the quarter pole, angled in and chased two wide entering the stretch, could not make any
headway on the winner in the final furlong but was clearly second best. TESSUTO chased in hand early and was taken out widest, went four then five wide
on the turn before angling down to the three path around the bend, could not summon the needed rally and edged HEART HEADED for the show honors.
HEART HEADED broke a step slow, stalked from inside, lost ground around the bend, churned on from the fence in the drive but could not get by
TESSUTO for third.

PROOF HE RIDES took control early with DISKO TRIBUTE to the outside, headed by that rival leaving the turn, battled down the lane and gamely
prevailed. DISKO TRIBUTE prompted the pace from outside, dueled into and down the lane, battled to the wire but could not get by. GIVE ME THE LUTE
brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, stalked from inside in hand, saved ground to the stretch, chased within striking distance through the lane but
could not summon the needed late kick. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) stalked the pace off the rail, went two to three wide around the bend and finished
evenly late. GRAZED broke a step slow from outside and dropped back to last, steered down to the inside, angled out into the stretch, kept trying through
the lane but needed to find more late.

RAISING SILVER stalked four deep up the backstretch, chased three wide into the lane, bid between rivals late and got his nose down to win a narrow
photo. MOONLIGHT TRYST lagged behind early wide up the backstretch, went five wide into the turn, started to move while steered down to the three path,
tipped back out in upper stretch, rallied four deep and got edged by RAISING SILVER at the wire. EPIONE pressed the pace from outside early, lost touch
the leader around the turn, chased two wide into the lane, came again late and missed in a blanket finish. BETTY PACK set the tone early with EPIONE to
the outside, shook free around the turn, led clear into deep stretch and got run down by a trio of rivals. ANZA SKY chased three deep between rivals up the
backstretch, started to weaken while moving into the two path around the turn and weakened in the drive.

INDY'S STAR raced keenly in hand along the inside chasing the leader, tipped two wide on the far turn, had to steady briefly when running up on heels at
the quarter pole, tipped out into the clear, bid three deep in upper stretch and proved best in the final sixteenth. DREAM PRINCESS raced in range from the
two path, stalked three deep leaving the backstretch, took aim two wide into the lane, challenged in upper stretch, took over shortly after but got outkicked
by the winner in deep stretch. DOLLY MAY (IRE) tucked inside at the back, trailed to the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane, angled out midstretch and
finished willingly for third. ZEYARAAT settled inside, went between foes into the far turn, got shuffled back to last around the bend, chased two wide into the
stretch and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. WORTHY OF MAGIC off alertly then took a stalking position from inside, eased over the to
the two path on the clubhouse turn, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, took over with three furlongs remaining, cleared around the far turn, tested by outer
rivals in upper stretch and weakened in the last sixteenth. FREEDOM LASS fractious in the gate, traveled two wide near the back, chased three then four
deep on the far turn and could not rally. ICE QUEEN went up to take control then crossed to the inside once clear, showed the way up the backstretch, lost
command at the three-eighths pole, chased the new leader around the turn and weakened in the furlong grounds. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY stalked from the
three path early on, four deep leaving the backstretch, chased three deep into the lane and weakened.

MAN O ROSE closest in pursuit off the rail early on, reeled in the pacesetter on the turn and drew alongside entering the stretch, took over and cleared in
upper stretch and was kept busy to the line. LOVESICK BLUES chased two wide to the stretch, finished well in the final furlong but could not reach the
winner. PRINCIPE CARLO chased outside rivals off the pace, rounded the bend four wide, kept on through the lane and gained third. GOOD WITH
PEOPLE chased out of range off the rail, navigated the turn three wide, tipped out into the stretch and could not produce a bid. KINGDOM HEART sped
clear from inside and set the pace in hand up the backstretch, lightly coaxed around the bend then asked right handed when confronted by MAN O ROSE
approaching the stretch, offered little resistance and relinquished the lead, then weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SPECIAL CLUB sat off the pace and moved inside, tipped out leaving the turn, asked left handed in upper stretch, rallied to the front midstretch and won
going away. KEEP IT COMING traveled along the inside at the back, advanced through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and rallied for second.
CAPITAL OUTLAY dueled for the lead from inside, battled to midstretch, could not kick on with the winner in deep stretch and held third. WESTERN GRIT
dueled outside CAPITAL OUTLAY for the lead to midstretch and weakened late. DON'T HIT ME BASH stalked off the inside, asked right handed three wide
leaving the turn, switched to the left hand in upper stretch and weakened. FINNERS GOLDNSENSE stalked the top pair from inside, worked on around the
turn and weakened down the lane. STEPHORTLESS traveled outside a rival at the back, got blocked behind a rival at the quarter pole, shifted to the inside
and failed to menace. ONLY ALLEGED chased between rivals out of range, bumped with CHISPA ROJA into the turn, remained two wide around the bend
and lacked the needed response. CHISPA ROJA chased three deep off the pace, got bumped and forced wide by ONLY ALLEGED into the turn, had the
rider lose his iron briefly, regained his footing around the bend and was not persevered with in the stretch.
