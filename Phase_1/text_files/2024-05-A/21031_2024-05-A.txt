Footnotes
STYLISH STYLE tracked the embattled top trio in early stages, let out a notch with three furlongs left to run, advanced to clear the lead near the quarter
pole, came two wide into upper stretch and pulled away. HANKS GIRL vied inside for the early, led the way by a slight margin entering the turn, got
overtaken by the winner late on the turn, sustained bid and finished clearly second best. NATUSIA sat just off the early pace, saved ground on the turn, cut
the corner entering upper stretch and ran on to secure show. CLASSIC CASH came away awkwardly at the start, raced in the back and saved ground
around the turn, hustled along the inside through the lane and lacked the needed response for impact. WICKED HOT FOOT was forwardly placed through
the backstretch, began to weaken late on the turn and continued to tire in the drive. MY HEART'S ON FIRE vied two wide for the early lead, could not keep
up the pace past the quarter pole and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
GRAPHENE CASSOCK tracked the pace through the early going, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, dug in at the head of the lane, took the lead a
furlong out and just lasted under strong encouragement. IMPRESSOR raced off the early pace, went two to three wide around the turn, raced behind a wall
of pursuers in upper stretch, got clear a furlong out and was getting to the winner late. BARBERSHOP sat off the top two flights, hustled up four wide around
the turn, swung five wide into the lane and sustained a solid bid for a share. VYING EDGE dueled for the lead up the backstretch, fought back in upper
stretch, got collared at the eighth pole and gave way. LIBERTY'S HAULER rated off the top two flights, was ridden along the rail around the turn, tipped out
at the head of the lane and failed to respond when called upon. BORDINOS was forwardly placed on the inside, waited for a clear path around the turn,
shifted two wide at the head of the lane and failed to move on. EXPLOSIVE PRIDE dueled for the early lead, fought back around the turn then gave way in
the lane. CONSTITUTION DAY raced off the pace, swung five wide into upper stretch and never menaced.

SUCCESSION was off a step slow at the start and settled off the early pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide and given cue in upper
stretch, rallied willingly and swept by with ease. GOLD TAPPER pressed the early pace, vied two wide around the turn, continued to battle down the lane,
got a head in front late then got overtaken by the winner. BIG PINES SANDY settled through early stages, hustled up three wide around the turn and
sustained bid through the lane. TOSKA'S RULER set a pressured pace through the backstretch, continued to duel around the turn, dug in gamely holding a
slight edged then came up tired near the sixteenth pole. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND raced off the early pace, swung three wide into the lane and lacked a
needed rally. C R INSTA GATOR was forwardly placed through the backstretch then weakened around the turn. LAWLESS JOHN raced in close contention
in the early going then steadily retreated.

DIAMOND RIM reared in the air at the start and spotted the field several lengths, steadily moved up into closer contention through the backstretch, let out a
notch leaving the backstretch, quickly moved up to take the lead mid-way around the turn, spun out three wide entering the lane, straightened two wide and
finished well clear. DEVIL'S TOWER tracked the pace through the backstretch, made a move two wo three wide around the turn, set down for the drive
three wide and cleared second best. DOCTOR OSCAR dueled for the lead through the opening quarter, continued to battle entering the turn, got collared by
the eventual winner at the five sixteenths pole but stayed on and lasted for a share. SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR was well reserved through early stages,
swung five wide into upper stretch and gained late. CONCEPT tracked the pace up the backstretch then weakened around the turn. BIG LUKE raced in
range in the opening quarter, failed to advance under urging around the turn and weakened in the lane. TIME MACHINE dueled inside through the
backstretch and faded around the turn. HASTINGS SUNRISE chased in range in the opening quarter, came up empty near the quarter pole and dropped
back.

Footnotes
ACELA EXPRESS tracked the pace two wide through the backstretch, edged up closer late on the turn, given cue three wide at the head of the lane, roused
forward to put a head in front with a furlong left to run then kicked clear. GLAMOROUS LIFE was well reserved racing in the back through the backstretch
and around the turn, swung four wide into the u8pper stretch, shifted five to sixx wide for a clear path and surged late to capture second. BREW CASA was
never too far back in early stages, made a four to five wide bid late on the turn, shifted in a couple paths down the lane, sustained bid and got caught late for
place. AUNT NADINE tracked the duel in the early going, rode the rail around the turn, shifted out and launched a three wide bid in upper stretch, moved
into contention and just missed show. IVY ABAD GIRL dueled for the lead from the onset, led the way by a slim margin around the turn, fought back when
challenged at the head of the lane, remained in strong contention past the furlong marker then came up tired late. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN vied inside of
IVY ABAD GIRL, remained in striking distance around the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then weakened. GIRLS IN CHARGE tracked the early
leaders, hustled up three wide in range around the turn then came up empty in the lane.
