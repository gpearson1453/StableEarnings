Footnotes
CITY SHACK stalked the early speed from outside, commenced her bid three wide on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch, gradually lugged in inside the
last eighth and shook free of REDHEADEDSTRANGER inside the final sixteenth. REDHEADEDSTRANGER vied for the lead from inside to upper stretch
then began to slowly yield. IMAGE OF CURLIN raced in contention from outside from the beginning, lacked a stretch rally but caught the tiring GRACEFUL
SCARLETT for third. GRACEFUL SCARLETT broke on top, was soon sharing the lead just outside REDHEADEDSTRANGER, edged ahead upper stretch,
was challenged from both sides at the top of the lane then gradually wore down. DIXIE RAG chased from off the rail and was never a factor. TOUR DE'
PORT was a contender from inside the first two furlongs, her rider lost his crop and she faded on the bend.

Footnotes
BASEBALL POLITICS shared the lead from inside, moved ahead when allowed leaving the turn, floated out some entering the stretch then opened up
under urging. MKAR THE FAST advanced three wide on the bend, drifted out briefly upper stretch, was corrected, drifted out again as he battled for second
with a sixteenth left, was corrected again and narrowly lasted for the place. SEMINOLE BEACH in contention early outside the pacesetters, did not keep up
just off the rail on the turn, came again from inside upper stretch, fought for the place, did not have enough late but proved easily best of the others.
AHEADOFTHEGAME broke somewhat awkwardly, chased from inside, floated out for the stretch run and lacked a significant response. YOU'RE IN
COREY hesitated at the break, chased from between rivals, was widest taking the turn, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the lane and had little
to offer. CRANKSHAFT displayed early speed outside BASEBALL POLITICS then began to fade before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
ANUNKA hustled along early, shared the lead between rivals, stayed two wide through the turn, drew clear when asked upper stretch and proved much the
best ridden out. EIGHT MAY vied for the lead outside horses from the beginning, came three wide into the lane, was no match for ANUNKA but was
unchallenged for second. KNUCKLE broke well but soon dropped back from outside, lost ground, four to six wide through the turn, lodged a mild bid into the
stretch, took over third with a furlong to go then could only pull clear for the show late. DURANGO CHROME in contention early between rivals, did not keep
up three wide on the bend but passed between tired ones in the stretch. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN progressed from inside on the turn, fanned outside EIGHT
MAY entering the lane and leveled off. LORD ZEKE `was a brief factor just off the inside, angled outside MARK'S BUDD JACIN at the top of the stretch and
faded. NEAP TIDE raced in the second flight on the backstretch but began to yield three wide on the bend. ARTIE AND JESSIE was hustled along to
dispute the pace from inside but began to tire after three furlongs.

RUNNINGFORCASH rated from inside, angled out through the bend as he commenced his bid, rallied outside XPRESSIR, gained the lead with a sixteenth
left then drew off through the waning yards. XPRESSIR was sent to vie for the lead from inside, moved clear on the turn, floated out entering the lane, was
no match for RUNNINGFORCASH deep stretch but was unchallenged for the place. GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS prominent from just off the inside, fanned
out some into the lane, altered inside XPRESSIR for a clear path upper stretch, began to wear down in the late going but lasted for third. PAYNT BY
LETTERS chased from outside, angled in on the turn, lodged a mild bid upper stretch, altered outside GRANDDADDYLONGLEGS at the sixteenth marker
and narrowly missed the show. MAPACHE G hesitated at the break, angled in on the bend, fanned out to path three for the drive, also lodged a mild bid and
altered out as PAYNT BY LETTERS came out at the sixteenth pole. BLUE NORTHER displayed brief speed then began to fade while widest on the turn.

Footnotes
MYSTIC POWER without early speed between horses, saved ground taking the turn, surged along the rail in the lane, moved clear inside the final sixteenth,
bore out in the waning yards but held on. SOLOMON VANDY settled well off the inside, lost ground as he picked up his pace widest through the bend,
rallied through the lane but was too late. WICKED GUS unruly in the gate before the start, was bumped at the start, progressed from inside on the turn,
swung out leaving the bend and found best stride too late from between horses. DIAMONDONICE bumped just after the break, soon shared the lead
outside SHEBA'S PAL, moved clear on the turn and stayed just off the inside, began to drift out inside the last furlong as he wore down between rivals and
was altered in to stay clear of SOLOMON VANDY in the waning yards. BRAHMS JR. prominent just off or along the rail, gradually altered out trying to gain
a clear path in the lane, squeezed through tight quarters between horses nearing the sixteenth marker and did not have enough late. SHEBA'S PAL
displayed early speed from inside, did not keep up on the turn, fanned outside DIAMONDONICE leaving the bend, lugged in some upper stretch, began to
wear down inside the furlong marker and gradually altered out trying to stay clear of the latter in the late going. GONE AGAIN raced in the second flight from
outside, came into the stretch from path four and began to yield. TACTICAL REBEL broke inward, bumping WICKED GUS, chased from inside and was
never a factor. BRUCE ATTACK fractious in the gate, was taken out briefly then reloaded into the gate, bumped with DIAMONDONICE just after the start,
raced in contention between rivals on the backstretch but gave way three wide on the bend.

ARROW STRIKE chased from inside, came off the rail some on the second turn, angled outside MAC PANDOWDY upper stretch, altered out inside the
final furlong trying to stay clear of the latter inside the last furlong, brushed with CITY OF GOD slightly, dueled for the lead between rivals the final sixteenth,
edged ahead in the waning yards and narrowly held on. CITY OF GOD raced in contention from outside, lost ground four then five wide through the second
bend, was crowded briefly inside the last eighth pole, altered out some, closed well but just missed. MAC PANDOWDY broke a bit outward, bumping
LASTFORTINOFAMILY, gradually progressed just off the inside, took a narrow advantage just inside the final furlong marker, began to drift out under
left-handed pressure, was challenged from outside with a sixteenth left and lugged in nearing the wire. SANTINO'S FANTASY hustled early to keep the
inside, moved clear on the backstretch, was challenged leaving the second turn, battled in the lane, began to wear down inside the last eighth and was
steadied behind MAC PANDOWDY in the final strides. SMILE LIKE KYLE was prominent from paths three or four for seven furlongs, began to yield while in
tight quarters just inside the eighth pole, was steadied slightly behind ARROW STRIKE then continued to give way. LASTFORTINOFAMILY bumped at the
start, showed little.

Footnotes
TENSE broke on top, was soon clear of the others, showed the way just off the rail, was challenged at the top of the lane, battled gamely and kept TINA'S
TAPIZAR at bay. TINA'S TAPIZAR exchanged several bumps with TOO MUCH TUESDAY on the backstretch as those two raced closest to TENSE,
commenced her bid two wide on the turn, dueled outside TENSE through the stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. TOO MUCH
TUESDAY altered out some midway on the backstretch to gain a clear path, bumped several times with TINA'S TAPIZAR, did not keep up from along the
rail on the bend, came again from inside through the stretch but was too late. BAR MONEY chased from inside, angled out through the turn, lost further
ground fanning five wide into the stretch, closed well but also came up short. WILDWOOD TRIPLE made a small leap from the gate, chased from just off the
inside, altered outside TINA'S TAPIZAR inside the last furlong and rallied belatedly as well. LUTION progressed along the rail on the turn, fanned out behind
TINA'S TAPIZAR into the lane, began to close the gap, altered out for a clear path with a sixteenth left and continued to make up ground in the waning
yards. WICKED SKY raced in midpack, was three then four wide taking the bend, began to fade upper stretch, altered to the outside with a furlong left and
finished evenly. BLUE EVEN SCORE three to five wide throughout, failed to menace. JEMEZ FALLS showed little in a wide trip.
