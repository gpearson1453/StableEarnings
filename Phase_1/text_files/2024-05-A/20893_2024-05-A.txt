best. TIZ INDEPENDENCE wouldn't load in the gate, stumbled at the start, raced wide down the backstretch, angled in on the turn then went evenly.
TWILIGHT VISION stalked the pace three wide and lacked the needed response. CEVICHE was through early.

no threat. BACK UP GHOST was no factor. TRAMA QUEEN pressed the pace two wide for six furlongs then stopped.
