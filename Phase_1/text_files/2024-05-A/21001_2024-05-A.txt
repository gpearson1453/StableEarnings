FLIPPING FISH never far back, surged three wide under right handed urging through deep stretch and got up in the final strides. SHADOW TRACER
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. IAN GLASS raced
inside early while always within striking distance, shifted out four wide at the top of the stretch and was steadily gaining ground late. GOING IN STYLE
sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until mid stretch then was outfinished. ROCKSTAR RO trailed into the
stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late five wide. DAVID'S GEM had inside speed for seven sixteenths of a mile then weakened.
