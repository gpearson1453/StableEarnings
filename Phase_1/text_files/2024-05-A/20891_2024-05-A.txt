IF WE GET LUCKY quickly moved clear, widened on the turn then remained safe while kept to his task. DISCO DEVIL bid three wide on the turn and just
lasted for the place while no threat to the winner. PORSUPUESTO lagged far behind then advanced wide with some late energy. REX KWON DO prompted
the pace briefly along the inside then proved empty in the stretch. ALTA FOX chased off the leaders, moved wide on the turn and flattened out.
MINXZHIPPSDONTLEYE dropped back early and was never in contention. BIG WARDEN flashed speed outside for quarter mile and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
TRUE PHENOMENON rated outside, bid on the turn, brushed with rival several times in the lane and was just up following a long drive. PUT THE CRAZY
AWAY set a clear pace for half a mile, was collared midway on the turn, came out brushing rival and just missed. TEMPEST RISING raced wide off the
pace, rallied then flattened out in the stretch. MOLLEWANTACRACKER raced far behind then passed rivals without menacing. SNOW LAKE broke slowest,
lacked speed and was never a factor. RAICHU saved ground within range early then gave way readily. FANCY WARRIOR fractious in the gate prior to the
start, flashed speed and stopped. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

RICH'S WAY had broken blinkers in the gate, was backed out and switched to replacement blinkers, then was bumped at the start, outrun early, moved up
at the quarter pole, angled out, rallied farthest outside, charged home outside rivals in deep stretch and was up in time. DREAMING OF GERRY raced off
the pace inside, came three wide into the lane, rallied between horses, dug in gamely in the final furlong and dueled to the finish. TIME TO CRUISE was
bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside, dug in gamely and dueled to the wire. LEGAL DEAL stalked
the leaders, made a strong bid nearing the quarter pole, led into the stretch, dug in gamely inside rivals and battled on to the finish. SIMOVITCH tracked
early, then moved up inside to contest the pace, vied inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. CONCEALED CARRY was bumped at the start, set the
early pace with a clear lead, then vied two wide for command, shook free on the far turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE DEMON controlled the pace, shook loose on the final turn then widened through the stretch under brisk handling. MY REDEMPTION prompted the
pace outside, proved no match for the winner but continued willingly in the stretch. MAKABIM saved ground throughout and closed well to gain the show.
MALIBU STAR saved ground behind the pacesetters, made a brief bid on the final turn then flattened. MIDNIGHT ACT was soundly bumped into the first
turn then chased wide throughout. SAINT MARCO was taken up then veered out into the first turn bumping rival, continued to bear out losing best chance.
BRETT'S WORLD prompted the pace three wide to the quarter pole and gave way.

DANCING ON MY OWN set the pace racing with a clear lead, shook free on the far turn, responded when asked, drew off and widened while being ridden
out. MOONBOOTS raced off the rail, off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn, dug in through final furlong and held second. SO FULLY SUE raced off
the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, closed mildly late on the rail and got third. FAYTASTIC stalked between rivals, chased three wide on the far
turn,
weakened
and
was
outkicked
for
the
show
spot.

TREBLE CLEF well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn, dueled and edged clear in the final furlong. JAA MODE vied three wide, shook
loose on the final turn, resisted and finished in a dead heat for the place. FLAT OUT FLYING lunged at the start, advanced near the inside and continued
gamely to finish in a dead heat for second. VICTIM OF THE NITE dueled between rivals to the three eighths pole and weakened. MODERN ERA lacked
speed, chased very wide passing fading rivals. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY moved within range three wide then weakened steadily. MY LAST MISSION reserved
off the pace inside and lacked a response. SUPREME BEING trailed for three quarters and was never in contention. DROPLINE alternated for the lead
inside to the far turn and stopped abruptly.
