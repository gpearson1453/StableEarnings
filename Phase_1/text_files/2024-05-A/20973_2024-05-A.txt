Footnotes
THE RABBI was off slow in the beginning, moved to the inside racing towards the rear, took the turn two then three wide, swung out into the lane, flew late
and inhaled the top pair late to win clear. FAST CHAZ was closest in pursuit raced off the rail then outside a rival, bid two wide on the turn, gained the lead
approaching the eighth pole, held command into deep stretch but yielded to the winner late. OMEY ISLAND sped clear to establish the front, confronted by
FAST CHAZ on the turn, relinquished the lead with a furlong remaining, fought on to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. TRIBAL chased three deep to the
stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. MARSH CREEK broke slow and inward, ran up on heels and had to take hold on the backstretch, saved
ground through the turn, tipped out but got brushed and crowded in upper stretch and could not rally after. HIGHLY DESIRABLE (IRE) broke a step slow
and in a bit, chased between rivals and lacked a rally. UNCLE MO'S GOLD hit the gate to lose a step at the start, stalked from inside under a hold,
continued along the fence around the turn and weakened. ABITMISCHIEVOUS broke a step slow, raced outside a rival near the back, navigated the turn
three then four wide and failed to respond when called upon. MYSTERIOUS HUSBAND came away slow, ran awkwardly onto the dirt crossing, trailed along
the inside to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SLEW'S JOY broke well then chased the top pair from off the rail, bid three deep on the turn then fought outside SARSHPI CHEWBACCA into the stretch,
fought with rivals on both sides into deep stretch, took a bump late and dug in to prove best. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA bumped with outer rival in the
beginning, pressed the pace from inside, inched ahead early on the turn, put away DIVINE RASCAL at the quarter pole but still had to content with SLEW'S
JOY leaving the bend, battled with that rival while drifting out, bumped the winner late and yielded grudgingly. EL DIABLO ROJO broke a couple lengths
slow, traveled along the inside leaving the backstretch then angled out quickly on the turn, spun four wide into the lane, drew alongside the top pair with a
furlong left to run but lacked the needed late punch to get by. ESTABLISHED broke out, chased four then five wide on the turn, kept trying through the lane
but needed to find more. DIVINE RASCAL bumped leaving the gate, took control early and set the pace outside a rival up the backstretch, lost the lead early
on the turn, failed to keep up approaching the quarter pole and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
ALL THAT GLORY stepped to the front and showed the way up the backstretch, set the pace along the inside into the stretch, met the bid from TEES
TOUCH (GB) at the eighth pole and held the runner-up at bay. TEES TOUCH (GB) stalked the lone leader off the rail, took aim two wide into the stretch,
drew alongside ALL THAT GLORY at the furlong marker but lacked the needed late kick to go by. CATHAL (IRE) start to climb crossing on to the dirt then
settled into stride, raced along the inside towards the rear, got shuffled back a bit early on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and got up for third. IN
SUSPENSE jumped onto the dirt, chased along the rail, roused on the turn, moved out in the lane, could not summon the needed rally and lost third.
ANGIER chased off the rail then between rivals before moving inside, shifted in at the three-eighths pole, saved ground into the stretch and could not rally.
VADER traveled outside a rival near the back, took the turn two to three wide and failed to menace. EISENHOWER chased two wide and weakened down
the lane. MENDELSSOHNS MUSIC hesitated slightly to break a hair slow, dropped back early, rounded the bend two wide, steered out at the top of the
stretch and was not a factor.

MYSTIC SPIRIT pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader midway around the far turn, took over into the stretch and maintained a short lead over
the runner-up to the wire. J DUTTON hustled to the front and moved inside, pressured by MYSTIC SPIRIT from outside, dueled past the five-sixteenths
pole, lost command into the stretch, fought back from inside through the length of the stretch, lacked the necessary late punch to regain command but was
clearly second best. PUDDIN HEAD JONES chased along the rail then moved into the two path climbing on the first turn, steered out into the clear on the
backstretch, rounded the far turn three then two wide and offered a mild rally to best the others. RHINO chased along the inside into the clubhouse turn, ran
up on heels and had to steady then pull around the first turn, coaxed along the rail into the far turn, angled out around the bend, spun four wide into the lane
and weakened. IGNATOWSKI tracked three deep early, continued three wide into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, tipped further out and failed
to respond. MUCHO SUERTE steadied two wide early on the first turn, ridden along two wide then moved inside on the far turn and weakened.

between rivals at the eighth pole and got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. LAULNE (FR) brushed the gate to lose a step at the start, stalked along
the rail into the turn, tipped two wide across the dirt, bid between foes at the eighth pole and lacked the needed final kick in the closing moments. GIRL OF
MY DREAMS took control quickly, showed the way along the rail through the turn, put to right handed urging when confronted by a trio of challengers in
upper stretch, fought into the final sixteenth and faltered late. SHAMROCKIN trailed along the rail through the turn, moved out a bit crossing surfaces,
steered out further in the lane and summoned a mild rally but was too late. ANTIFONA (FR) tracked outside a rival then bumped three deep entering the
turn, continued outside rivals around the bend, spun four wide into the lane and finished evenly in the furlong grounds. ALLURING settled off the pace,
bumped with ANTIFONA (FR) entering the turn, chased between rivals around the bend, followed within range in the stretch, angled to the inside late but
failed to produce a bid. FLATTERY allowed to settle in the early going, tucked inside for the turn, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a response when
called upon.

Footnotes
SQUALOTORO sat off the pace, went two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend, moved further out in the lane, rallied and won the
bob over HABEAS at the wire. HABEAS bumped leaving the gate, went up to duel from outside, took over three wide into the stretch, put away inner rival at
the eighth pole, then fought inside a pair of challengers while drifting out and suffered an unlucky bob on the line. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT forwardly placed
outside the top pair, bid from the four path entering the lane, got floated out by HABEAS in the final furlong and almost lost the third. EREBUS bobbled and
bumped rival leaving the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing, kept on willingly in the drive and missed third. ZE'BUL bobbled leaving the gate,
trailed two wide then along the rail, angled out with a furlong remaining and gained ground late. CROWNING GOLD stepped to the front then dueled inside
ZE'BUL, held a short lead through the turn, lost command while coming off the rail into the stretch, failed to keep up outside the eighth pole and weakened.
STOP AND A TRES chased widest up the backstretch, took the turn four then five wide and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
VITALERA (CHI) closest in pursuit from the two path, took over crossing the dirt, fought inside a pair of rivals in the furlong grounds and held gamely. JUST
NAILS traveled in mid-pack early on, took the turn three then four wide, moved out in the lane to launch a bid, came on late but ran out of time. EXCELIA
(IRE) raced in range in the early going, saved ground around the bend, tipped two wide over the dirt, moved out further in the lane, bid between rivals in
upper stretch and got denied. REAL FIRE got crowded between rivals early, chased along the rail into the turn, bumped with outer rival shortly after, moved
out into the lane, came back in and finished well. PASTICHE (GB) was off slow to begin, trailed early then raced towards the rear on the turn, tipped out in
upper stretch and finished well. LLORONA chased three wide into the turn, quickly moved into the two path early on the bend, drew closer and started to
launch a bid while drifting out on the dirt, fought three deep into the final furlong and faltered late. TIERGARTEN unhurried in the opening stages, went three
wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch, angled out then moved back in some and gained ground late. BIG SUMMER traveled near the back into the
turn, rounded the bend two then three wide, steered out across the dirt and failed to rally. JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT sat off the pace, bumped with rival early on
the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and could not rally. HAYLEY LEVADE reserved in the early going and was taken down to the inside, raced a bit off
the rail into the lane and could not make an impact. MYLITTLERUNAWAY sped clear and showed the way along the inside, lost command crossing over the
dirt and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
OLD PAL pulled early when reserved to the back and moved inside, tipped three wide entering the stretch, moved out further in the final furlong, surged late
from outside and overhauled the runner-up. CITY EXILE (GB) stalked from the two path, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, put a head in front at
the top of the stretch, put away JEWELED SHILLELAGH, fought with BARELY FUNTIONAL into deep stretch, inched ahead from that rival but could not
fend off the late charge from the winner. BARELY FUNTIONAL stalked from inside, waited behind the leader on the far turn, given his cue entering the
stretch and launched a rail bid inside the top pair, dueled with CITY EXILE (GB) in the last sixteenth but lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch.
LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) traveled near the back outside a rival, swung out into the stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. JEWELED SHILLELAGH
cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged by outer rival at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead at the
three-sixteenths pole, stayed on to the sixteenth pole and weakened late. SEA SINGER (IRE) bothered by inner rival leaving the gate, allowed to settle on
the inside, drew closer on the backstretch, moved into range on the far turn, stayed on the inside to the stretch and lacked a rally. NASHOBA'S JOY raced
at the back outside a rival, navigated the far turn two then three wide before swing out into the stretch, asked in the lane and was never a factor.
RECKLESS SPIRIT settled near the inside on the clubhouse turn, went between rivals on the backstretch, waited still between foes on the second bend,
roused in upper stretch, bothered by the winner at the sixteenth pole and was not persevered with after. BLUE DOG tracked two wide early, went three deep
into the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, bothered by inner rival at the sixteenth pole and weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH OLD PAL DID SHIFT OUT AND FORCE RECKLESS SPIRIT INTO BLUE DOG, THE
INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.
