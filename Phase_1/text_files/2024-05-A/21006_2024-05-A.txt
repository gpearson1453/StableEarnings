Footnotes
BROWN KAT speed, best stride late. JJ JESSA DYNASTY solid effort, prevailed for 2nd. SIX MOONS RISEN gamely, missed 2nd. KISS MY FOLLY steady
gain. JUSTAPERFECT MOMENT awkward start, pinched back, late bid. RIO MARADONA early try, weakened. ONE EAGLE LADY broke in, no real threat.
PILOTOS GIRL no factor. B ALL IN dropped back quickly.
