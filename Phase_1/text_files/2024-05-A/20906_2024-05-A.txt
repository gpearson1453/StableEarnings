MOONLITE GRAHAM chased the pace outside DRISKILL around the track and was up between horses. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY broke slowly, rushed up
between horses mid way down the backstretch, was wide around the turn and closed gamely while steadily drifting out through the stretch. DRISKILL sped
to the early lead, set the pace off the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. PHOENICIAN GHOST laced speed, saved ground on the turn and offered a mild
gain in the drive. SMOOTH PAPA , outside horses around the turn, was not a factor. LIMITED OFFER chased the early pace and retreated in the stretch
run.

ARIZONA LINDY accelerated to the early lead, stayed far removed from the inner rail through out and was kept to her business in the drive. TIA SUZI , well
off the inner rail throughout, chased the winner in a willing effort. INZAWAY bore out leaving the starting gate, was three wide leaving the turn and passed
tired horses. SWIVEL HIPS was never a factor. LIL EFFORT broke slowly, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was outrun. KARMA DE VILLE chased
the pace outside the winner, faltered and was eased late.

MR NAVIGATOR , patiently handled along the inner rail to the far turn, eased off the rail approaching the stretch, challenged for the lead outside FIRST
CALL turning for home, dueled through the lane and determinedly prevailed. FIRST CALL set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out a bit entering the
stretch, dueled inside the winner and just missed in a sharp effort. ARIZONA JEREMY , unhurried early, raced along the inner rail throughout, was well
positioned entering the stretch and flattened out. MR LOVE MUFFIN , three wide both turns, chased the pace to the stretch and tired. MARICOPA COUNTY
swung four wide leaving the far turn and lacked a rally. OUTOFQUEMADO chased the pace between horses down the backstretch and gave way on the far
turn.
