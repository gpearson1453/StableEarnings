Footnotes
STAY LIT allowed to settle in the early stages, raced two wide along the clubhouse turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run while not far back,
maintained a two wide path into the second turn then waited for racing room at the quarter pole, found room along the inside into upper stretch and loomed
at the furlong marker, made a sustained rally into the final sixteenth and vied for the lead into deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the final strides and
determinedly held on for the win at the finish. HELEN'S SUN broke alertly and assumed command leaving the start, showed the way into the first turn then
ceded the lead to FANTASTIC DREAM entering the backstretch run, stalked that rival through modest fractions heading to the half-mile marker, was roused
three wide into the far turn and vied for the lead into upper stretch, took a narrow advantage at the furlong marker, held a slim lead into the final sixteenth,
was outfinished in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for place honors. UPRIGHT settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn,
maintained an inside path through the backstretch run and was well placed into the far turn, chased from the inside approaching the quarter pole, vied for
the lead into the stretch while drifting into the two path, could not keep pace with the top pair into the final sixteenth and held safely at the finish for third.
FANTASTIC DREAM prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace then assumed command into the backstretch run, set modest fractions while
clear heading to the half-mile marker, showed the way into the far turn, was overtaken into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. LOVE OF THE
SPORT three wide into the first turn, settled off of the modest pace while never far back, mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, could not sustain
that run into the stretch and flattened out. BALLROOM PRINCE a bit slow away from the start, settled off of the early pace, lost action at the six furlong
marker, was pulled up and was vanned off.

TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the quick pace three deep nearing the half-mile marker, raced close up into the turn
and mounted a three wide bid at the quarter pole, battled FIVE O COCKTAIL into the stretch, shook free of that rival into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure
from the runner-up and held in a drive at the finish. PRINCESA DEL TIGRE forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the solid early pace from between
runners, took back entering the turn then got caught a bit in tight at the quarter pole, swung widest for the drive, closed willingly in the late stages, pressured
the winner in deep stretch but could not get by the winner and was clear of the rest for place honors. FIVE O COCKTAIL prominent in the early going,
pressed the quick pace between rivals heading into the turn, vied for the lead at the quarter marker and battled TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL into the lane, could
not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. ROUSING JEWEL broke a bit slowly leaving the start, rushed up and assumed early
command, set a pressured pace approaching the half-mile marker, disputed the pace into the turn, lost position at the quarter marker and faded in the
stretch drive.

Footnotes
THE FUSS took up at the start after breaking awkwardly to the outside, spotted the field a head start and was last down the backstretch but not far from the
front of the compact field, made a mid-race move three wide through the turn then tipped out four wide into the stretch, ran on well under left handed urging
despite trying to lug in for the whole of the stretch run. R HEART OF GOLD broke well was not asked for speed early but was caught four to five wide down
the backstretch, continued wide through the turn and moved into contention in hand, then came four wide into the stretch, took a short lead to mid-stretch
and finished well but could not hold off the eventual winner in the final yards. STEVE'S BIG TICKET outrun early, made some forward progress through the
turn then came in tight while two wide nearing the quarter marker, remained stuck in traffic into upper stretch, found room at the furlong marker but could not
find the needed late response and finished evenly. TOP WOLF broke well but opted to sit just behind the early speed duel, bid between runners and vied
three wide at the quarter marker, battled into the stretch, chased R HEART OF GOLD to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and
weakened. TAVERNELLE broke well and dueled through the initial furlong with THE CHIEFHASTRICKS, took over the lead passing the three furlong pole,
then was challenged by R HEART OF GOLD and THE FUSS approaching the quarter pole, gave way to those two at the top of the stretch and faded in the
stretch. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was hustled to the front from the break and dueled to through solid fractions inside of TAVERNALLE, weakened before the
quarter pole then had nothing to offer in the stretch.

WRONG DIRECTION checked in the early stages while racing behind a hard to place SIX HOT GRANDS, recovered into the first turn and stalked the pace
three wide into the backstretch run, was well placed while tracking the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, chased three wide into the far turn and
gained ground at the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and battled MONSIEUR to the furlong pole, shook free into the final sixteenth and drew clear
in deep stretch while a bit green in the late stages. MONSIEUR away in good order, ceded the early lead and stalked the pace two wide along the first turn,
raced close to the decent pace heading to the half-mile pole, roused two wide into the far turn and took a narrow lead at the quarter marker, was confronted
into the stretch by WRONG DIRECTION and met that foe's bid nearing the furlong pole, battled while racing on the left lead past mid-stretch, could not
match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. POLIS forwardly placed away from the start, assumed command into the first turn
and set the pace into the backstretch run, carved out decent fractions nearing the half-mile marker, came under pressure into the second turn and was
overtaken heading to the quarter pole, chased the leading pair into the stretch, weakened in the final stages and was clear in the end for third. CONEJO
MALO unhurried in the early stages, went two wide along the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, was steered outside of runners into
the far turn and chased three to four wide nearing the quarter marker, made contact with EL GOLOSO into upper stretch, was outrun to the furlong pole and
passed tired rivals in the final sixteenth. EL GOLOSO allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the
backstretch run while not far back, guided two to three wide into the far turn, got caught in tight leaving the quarter marker and was shuffled into upper
stretch, lost ground into the stretch and gave way in the final stages. SIX HOT GRANDS forwardly placed leaving the start, was rank and hard to place while
between horses approaching the first turn, settled into the backstretch run and tracked the decent pace heading to the half-mile marker, saved ground into
the second turn and chased to the quarter pole, drifted out a path at the top of stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and tired late.

command past mid-stretch and was kept to task into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from his stablemate and held for the win at the finish. LOOKOUT
POINT took back off of the early pace and settled two wide into the first turn, raced between rivals into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace
approaching the half-mile marker, maintained a two wide path between runners into the second turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied while widest into

path through the backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the far turn, was boxed in at the quarter marker and remained stuck in traffic into upper
stretch, shifted out past mid-stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth and got up in the final strides to secure the show. JERRY JEFF WALKER prominent away
from the start, stalked the early pace two wide into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and prompted the modest pace heading to the half-mile
pole, dueled JEDI KNIGHT into the second turn then battled for the lead into the stretch, remained within range into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in
deep stretch and just missed for third. JEDI KNIGHT sent to establish the early lead, dictated terms into the first turn and set a modest pace into the
backstretch run, was prompted by JERRY JEFF WALKER nearing the half-mile marker and dueled that rival into the second turn, battled for the lead into
upper stretch, stubbornly fought on past the furlong marker, could not hold off oncoming foes in deep stretch and weakened in the final stages. LOADED

Footnotes
TURA LURA broke well and was first into the turn with ALL HALLOWS attending just to the outside, was roused at the quarter pole and put that rival behind,
opened up a clear lead turning into the stretch and held all at bay under strong handling and intermittent urging. SHANGHAI MIST took a bump from ALL
HALLOWS after the break, then was allowed to settle in a tracking position about three wide and behind the two leaders, launched a bid approaching the
three furlong pole, chased TURA LURA down the stretch but could not reel that one in while finishing clear of the next horse. ALL HALLOWS hustled but
broke outward and bumped SHANGHAI MIST a few strides from the gate, settled into a stalking position as TURA LURA took the early lead, came under
pressure approaching the quarter pole and could not threaten down the lane but kept to task and was able to just hold third. NORTHERN ROSE was last
away from the gate, angled over to the rail before the first turn, saved ground to the far turn, started a sustained run from the nine-sixteenths pole then came
three wide into the stretch, finished willingly under strong handling, was gaining but was along too late. FEISTY ELLA was not asked for speed away from
the gate and settled well off the early pace, to the inside and near the rear to the half mile marker, stayed to the inside through the far turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and could not muster a late response. VANDALIA came away clean from the gate then tucked in behind the pacesetters going into the first turn,
settled well behind then advanced steadily down the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn was starting to make a move then had to check hard off
the heels of ALL HALLOWS after passing the three-sixteenths pole and could not recover.

Footnotes
HARBOR'S ROSE was hustled away from the start and assumed early command, set solid fractions approaching the half-mile marker, showed the way into
the turn and carved out a decent pace while well handled nearing the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead at mid-stretch, was kept to task while clear into the
final sixteenth, felt some late pressure from oncoming rivals and held safely for the win in deep stretch. DADDYS NINA rated nicely off of the solid early
pace, was well placed heading into the turn and advanced four wide at the quarter marker, chased HARBOR'S ROSE to mid-stretch, was gaining on the
winner in the final sixteenth and held well for second at the finish. SAHARA SUE rated off of the solid early pace while not far back, was guided three wide
into the turn and chased the pace approaching the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch and ran evenly nearing the furlong pole, closed willingly in
the final sixteenth and just missed for second. STANDFORGRIT came away from the start in tight and took up in the early running, trailed to the half-mile
marker and was guided two wide into the turn, was last of all at the quarter pole, shifted three to four wide into the stretch, finished well in the final sixteenth
and found her best stride too late. AMANDA ROSE prominent leaving the start, stalked the solid early pace from an inside position, was well placed into the
turn and chased HARBOR'S ROSE approaching the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. DADDY INDEED
settled off of the solid early pace, improved position two wide into the turn, came in tight into upper stretch and lost position nearing the furlong marker,
re-rallied into the final sixteenth but needed more in the late stages. DRAW NEAR chased the solid early pace three deep, maintained a three wide path into
the turn and ran in pursuit nearing the quarter pole, was outrun to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SECRET CLUB unhurried in the early going, went three wide along the first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, maintained a three wide
path into the far turn, circled six wide into the stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, rallied strongly into the final sixteenth, took command in deep
stretch and held for a determined win. EGOMANIA settled in mid-pack in the early stages and raced two wide into the first turn, well placed through the
backstretch run while between rivals, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and continued to advance into the
stretch, rallied into the final sixteenth, was gaining in deep stretch and ran out of time at the finish, while holding well in the end for second. TALBOT BAY
forwardly placed away from the start, assumed command into the first turn, pulled clear down the backstretch setting moderate fractions, took on a host of
challengers near the quarter pole, battled back and held on the the lead to mid-stretch then gave way grudgingly in deep stretch, while just holding for third
at the wire. COUSIN RICHIE was devoid of early speed and held up in the back of the field for the first half mile, pulled hard down the backstretch then was
boxed in and blocked through the whole of the far turn, tried to rally through a small opening in upper stretch, found a bit of room past the furlong marker
then encountered traffic into the final sixteenth and just missed for third in a good effort. DOO WOP DON allowed to settle in the early running, maintained a
three wide path into the first turn, improved position along the backstretch run, mounted a five wide bid approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, offered a mild late rally but needed more in the final stages. ROBIE broke well but ceded the early lead to TALBOT BAY while tracking that rival
while racing at the head of the rest of the field, went to challenge for the lead passing the quarter pole but was met with some resistance, got the lead briefly
near the furlong marker but weakened a bit in the final yards and was outfinished. DRUIDIC settled while not far back in the early running, saved ground into
the first turn, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace heading to the half-mile pole, maintained an inside path
into the far turn and chased the leaders approaching the quarter marker, responded to urging and rallied at mid-stretch, could not sustain that bid into the
final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. UNION WAVE forwardly placed in the early stages, settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into
the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run, chased two wide into the second turn and was boxed in at the quarter marker, found a bit of room
into the lane and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and weakened in deep stretch. TAMARANDO STAR was forwardly placed
leaving the start, took back and settled four wide into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace while widest through the backstretch run, was roused five
wide into the second turn and loomed nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked at mid-stretch and tired in the final sixteenth. SEA DOG forwardly placed
away from the start, tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and tracked the moderate pace
approaching the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the far turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, came in tight and was shuffled nearing the top of
the stretch, trailed to the furlong marker and could not recover in the final stages.

Footnotes
SUPERNAL broke well then bumped slightly with BOOK EM TAMO twice in the initial yards, raced on the outside of four horses contesting the early pace
while under a snug hold, was let loose with three furlongs to run, pulled even with DRIVE BY at the quarter pole, quickly opened up when set down in upper
stretch, and easily held clear to the wire. AUTISM PUZZLE broke well but backed out of the developing speed duel, made a mid-race forward move through
the turn, slipped between horses at the quarter pole, chased SUPERNAL down the stretch, was unable to catch that foe but finished well clear of the third
horse. BOLD ENCOUNTER broke best but was unable to join the early pace battle, settled well behind the forward group to the turn then made a bid three
wide to get into contention, swung four wide into the stretch but left room for AUTISM PUZZLE to slip through inside then was unable to go on with that rival
in upper stretch, stayed on into the final sixteenth and just held for third at the wire. ZEN STATE hit the gate at the start and was away a bit slowly, lacked
any speed from the break and raced far behind the field to the turn, angled over to the rail, saved ground through the turn, came five wide into the stretch
still in last, then rallied down the middle of the track and just missed for third on the wire. DRIVE BY was hard ridden from the start and took a furlong to gain
the lead, extended the lead through the turn then had no response when SUPERNAL challenged at the quarter pole and faltered in the stretch. LAST BABY
broke well, dueled briefly with DRIVE BY then let that one go on from the nine-sixteenths pole, remained close up through the turn, came under pressure
near the quarter pole then was outkicked the rest of the way. BOOK EM TAMO exchanged a couple of light bumps with ZEN STATE after the break but
otherwise broke well and was in the early pace mix, raced close up through the turn, then struggled to keep up passing the three furlong marker and had
nothing to offer in the stretch.
