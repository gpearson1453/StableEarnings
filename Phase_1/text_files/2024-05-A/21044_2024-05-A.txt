SHE'S RESILIENT dueled for the early lead from between HEART ON THE THE RUN and FLYIN BY, opened a slight lead entering the stretch and then
held on gamely during the drive to just miss. MS FLASHY HARBOR saved ground chasing the leaders, angled out to be three-wide entering the stretch and
finished in a mild rally. EYES FOR GOLD was allowed to settle early, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. FLYIN BY disputed the
pace racing three-wide into the stretch and weakened late. LEMON DROP LADY dropped back early and failed to seriously threaten. HEART ON THE RUN
dueled for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
FRUIT LUTES vied with LUCCA'S LEGACY and SECRET RIDDLES for the lead from along the inside, opened clear entering the stretch and gradually
increased his advantage. SECRET RIDDLES prompted the pace while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner but held on well for the place. SIR
LOOKING GLASS was allowed to settle early, came six-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. DERBY BOY settled in the middle of the field,
moved up while being two-wide entering the stretch and then went evenly late. CHINOOK BEND saved ground chasing the pace but lacked a rally.
SECRET ENCORE was off slow to get away behind his field, then saved ground before angling out at the eighth pole and improved his position. CRAZY
STORM raced in the middle of the field, came five-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. LUCCA'S LEGACY vied for the lead to the stretch
from between horses and tired. WE GOT SWAG was four-wide on the turn while in the middle of the field, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to
menace.
