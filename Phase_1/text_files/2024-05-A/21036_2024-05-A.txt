Footnotes
LADY XI had good inside position nestled on the rail in the second flight, began to inch closer midway through the turn and was full of run late to get up on
the outside in the final few jumps before the wire. CADFAEL took command from the onset clearing to the rail, disposed of an early challenger at the three
eighths marker, opened up mildly at the top of the lane and was ran down by the winner in deep stretch just holding for the place share. BOB AND JULES
broke outwards on the start, tracked in mid-pack in the second flight down the backside, started to rally when urged at the quarter pole, angled out five wide
reaching for more ground turning for home and had a good late rally between rivals in the last sixteenth. BLONDINA'S BOY had a bit of a sluggish start to
see the field early, caught up to the pack inside going into the turn, saved ground around the bend, angled out to the four path with run and was closing the
gap late but could not pose a threat at the wire. SO CALLED VACATION broke well, then was allowed to settle on the outside near the rear, trailed the field
outside with a half left to run, made little headway three wide around horses on the turn, shifted widest to the six path for the drive but lacked a closing kick
to play role at the finish. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER improved between runners early on, took up the chase on the frontrunner at the half, was repelled by the
pacesetter with three eighths to go and yielded between foes in the three path in the final furlong.

Footnotes
TIME TO WATCH was unopposed dictating terms on the rail in the early going, maintained a slim advantage while hounded outside into the turn, was
collared outside turning for home and dug in stubbornly through stretch drive to prevail in a photo. FIREBOLT stalked near the rear at the break, made a
sharp moved around runners four wide from the five sixteenths pole to bid for the lead outside at the top of the stretch and fought on down the lane but was
outfinished to the wire. SLOANS SKY was scrubbed on early in the race to get a tracking position on the outside in midfield, could not match strides with
others making a move through the turn and under right handed encouragement closed smartly in deep stretch to be a good third at the wire.
TATOOSONMYSOUL was off a bit slow to begin, regrouped to have a good tracking position on the rail down the backstretch, waited comfortably behind
the frontrunning winner going around the bend and finished up willingly inside to settle on the fringes. CLASSIC GLORY was unhurried to trail along the
backside, began to pick up foes mid-turn, angled out behind the leaders with an eighth remaining but could not get into contention. SAKE AND SUSHI was
checked between horses nearing the half mile marker, lost ground plus positioning running around the bend and could not get involved outside runners in
the stretch drive. QUEEN SAHARA chased the pacesetter down the back straight, closed in to prompt the pace outside on the turn and stopped quickly in
the last sixteenth.

Footnotes
JULIE'S MIST broke inwards on the start, travelled on the rail in mid-division going comfortably through the back straight, kept pace with the leaders on the
bend, shifted out for clear run at the furlong pole four wide and rallied smartly late to edge away in deep stretch. TAVALINE hounded the pace in the
beginning, chased the loose pacesetter at the half, started to reel in the leader with five sixteenths from home, briefly assumed command inside the furlong
marker but did not have enough late to hold off the closing winner. I HAVE AN IDEA was situated close the back of the pack between horses in the early
stages, under right handed urging began to commence a rally in mid-turn and continued with good momentum in the five path through the stretch to win the
battle for show. DYNA'S FLATTER was brushed outside at the start to see the field down the backside, improved passing runners on the rail with three
eighths left to go and finished up well with runners on either side late to just miss for the third money. SILENT TRIBUTE had a slim advantage after the start,
opened up for a clear lead down the back straight, was headed on the outside at the top of the lane, battled until the sixteenth pole and tired in deep stretch.
SARAH'S DANCER stalked three deep outside foes near the rear in the beginning, came under a ride outside horses three furlongs from home losing
position, angled out widest in the six path at the top of the lane but could not close in to be a factor at the finish line.

Footnotes
BRIDGE TO NOWHERE bobbled, breaking out, brushing the outside foe at the start, smartly improved position on the rail by the half, closed the gap saving
ground around the turn, shifted just outside for the drive, quickly pounced to the lead in the final eighth and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish.
SERENADING HALL was situated three deep outside foes in midfield, had one foe beaten running throughout the turn and had a strong late rally up the
fence to make it interesting in deep stretch. PROUD SPEAKER edged clear from the pack leaving the chute to take control, opened up while in hand around
the turn, continued unopposed up front at the quarter pole, rider lost their crop entering the stretch, had no response when headed by the winner at the
furlong pole and faded late to hold for third money in the end. SOUPER COP was situated inside in the middle of the pack at the half, chased the pace being
scrubbed on around the oval and shifted out four wide at the top of the lane finishing up mildly to the wire for a minor role. SMILES FOR DAVID forced the
issue outside early on, could not maintain position by the three eighths pole and was one paced in the run to the finish line. P. S. RISING STAR stalked near
the rear in the early going, could not offer a rally on the turn and had little to show in the drive to the wire. MAKAYLA was brushed inside by the winner on
the break, tracked the front pair along the backstretch, was roused at the three furlong marker, offered no response and wilted between runners through the
turn.

Footnotes
TREBUCHET advanced inside up the backstretch, tracked through the turn saving ground, was guided out five wide at the top of the stretch with aim on the
leaders, drifted out a bit through the stretch but edged past late. HEY LUIGI was forwardly-positioned between runners early, pressed the leader into the
turn, edged closer drawing even with that one past the five-sixteenths and challenging for the lead, dueled from that point, exchanged a bump in upper
stretch, drifted out a bit, could not kick on with the winner but held the place. JACK lacked early speed despite some encouragement bringing up the rear,
saved ground on the turn, gained late inside. SING DIXIE settled into stride off the leaders two to three wide into the turn, came out six wide at the top of the
stretch for room, kicked on evenly. FASCINATION STREET was urged at the break, had forward position stalking the leading pair from outside into the turn
four deep, came out seven wide for the drive, kept on evenly. PIDIN moved to the lead inside rivals but just off the fence to force the pace, was hounded
throughout but engaged in a duel past the five-sixteenths, drifted a bit in upper stretch exchanging a light bump with that sparring partner, gave way late.
BOSTON BAY settled outside off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn swinging eight deep for the stretch run, failed to rally. ABSOLUTE
CHAIRMAN stalked from mid-pack two to three wide heading into the turn, was asked to keep pace by the five-sixteenths, had no response and retreated.

Footnotes
SILENT SKY was patiently handled behind runners on the fence in midfield down the backside, found a seam and quickly split foes three wide at the quarter
pole, had all the momentum travelling smartly to the lead in the five path in upper stretch and was full of run late to finish up much the best crossing the line.
NOW IS A BREEZE was three deep on the outside being a part of the tracking trio at the half, made an early move three wide going around foes with three
eighths left to run, assumed control in the five path turning for home, was no match for the winner late but held safe to best the rest in the end. GREAT
KATE was unhurried in the beginning trailing the pack, started to offer a rally inside midway through the bend, shifted out for a clear run in the five path at
the eighth pole and closed in to be a clear third in the end. TWO SIP SALLY had a rail trip watching the top pair in the early stages, waiting for room to move
inside at the quarter pole, and finished up evenly for a minor share when the rail opened up in upper stretch. FOXY DIVA stalked near the rear having one
foe beaten, started to go around horses when asked mid-turn going three wide, was fanned out seven wide for the stretch run and finished up mildly to the
wire. SEATTLE CAUSEWAY rated kindly between foes in the tracking group down the backstretch, settled in a good position three wide outside rivals
keeping a close eye on the top three at the quarter pole, could not keep the eventual winner inside straightening for home and could not fire down the
stretch. WELL ACTUALLY pulled the rider to the front through the backside, set the pace while challenged outside around the bend, shifted to the three path
while still in the mix for a small share at the top of the stretch but emptied on in the final sixteenth. ROSIEPOSIE hounded the pace on the outside after the
break, continued to force the issue through the turn and faltered in the four path by mid-stretch. MORAL TURPITUDE broke a step slow to begin, travelled
outside near the back four deep along the backside, could not quicken with five sixteenths left to run, trailed on the turn and could not be a presence in the
drive to the line.

Footnotes
JUNIOR HOT SHOT was away alertly to begin, settled nicely outside foes near the rear going down the backside, closed the gap while still in hand being
confidently handled at the quarter pole, was set down in the six path by mid-stretch and responded quickly to win going away in the end. YACHT BOY
chased the lone pacesetter down the back straight, closed outside throughout the turn, bid four wide turning for home, battled determinedly between horses
at the furlong marker but was outfinished in the last seventy yards. FIFTY B M G was hustled to get the lead after the start, was a little headstrong opening
up on his rivals at the half, was headed outside at the top of the stretch, fought on until the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly late. PONTIAC was void
of early speed, trailing down the back straight, could not get interested around the turn, swung out widest in the seven path driving to the line and closed in
to settle on the fringes at the wire. GUN COURT stalked on the fence in the early going, was under a snug hold behind rivals with five sixteenths left to run,
roused inside at the quarter pole, angled outside in the five path in mid-stretch and finished with intent surging between horses in the end. JO DADDY
tracked the loose leader on the rail at the half, kept tabs on the front two through the turn, battled for the show award in upper stretch but was outrun driving
to the finish line. RY PIE stalked in the third flight in the beginning, edged closer around the bend to be in the hunt five wide at the top of the lane for a piece
of the prize but gave way in the late stages of the race. CHASING BOURBON was situated in the middle of the pack with rivals on each side down the
backside, could not offer a rally when asked for more between foes in mid-turn and had no finish to offer in the stretch run.

Footnotes
NORMA NO prompted the pace down the backside, continued outside hounding the pace through the turn, seized control with two furlongs to go, opened
up on the chasing rivals with an eight remaining and held on by a diminishing margin for the wire at the wire. TWISTING PISTONS was bumped inside on
the start to have only one beaten down the backstretch, began to pick up runners on the rail three eighths out, shifted outside three wide at the quarter pole
going past horses smartly and was closing in with every stride down the stretch and just missed for the win with that very impressive effort. GATHER was on
the rail watching the engaged pair up front along the backside, waited to make a move behind the leaders at the quarter pole, shifted out for clear run three
wide between horses at the top of the stretch and won the minor battle to be a distant third at the finish. CALM COOL was in the second tier tracking the
contesting duo outside with a half remaining, inched closer three wide at the quarter pole to be in the thick of things by upper stretch but could not find more
late and stalled in the final furlong. ANNIA CORNIFICIA F was situated in mid-pack inside rivals in the early going, could not progress thru the field running
on the turn and weaved between tiring rivals passing some midway down the lane. TACHYON SPEED broke out, then inwards on the break, stalked in the
third flight inside down the backstretch, had no impression going around the oval and could not be a factor in the stretch run. LADIES RUM dueled inside
down the backstretch, poked her head in front with three furlongs to go, gave way on the inside to the winner at the quarter pole and yielded on the fence in
the final furlong. OLIVIA'S MELODY had only the two poor starters beaten down the back straight, made no impact running throughout the turn and showed
little in the drive to the finish line. BRIT was steadied on the break to trail the field down the backside, lost touch with the runners on the bend and could not
play a role in the stretch run.
