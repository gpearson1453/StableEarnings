Footnotes
NEECIE MARIE settled tracked the front from afar just off the inside at the tail of the field, tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close stoutly on the outside and was just up over a dueling pair to prevail
on the wire. WHITEBEAM (GB) two to three wide through the first turn, dueled three then two wide with SPIRIT AND GLORY to her inside, got set down
spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive continuing to knock heads through the length of the stretch, took a narrow lead late and then got
nailed on the line by the top one. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) dueled inside of the aforementioned foe from the get go patiently handled until let out taking
the inside route into upper stretch, continued the head to head combat through to the finish and was nailed in concert with her main pace rival while trading
bobs to the end in the very last jump. QUARREL chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper
stretch, offered up a mild kick but was outkicked by the top trio. ASPRAY bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was unable to make an impact.

roused late on that bend, rallied through a clear rail opening in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead inside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under
good handling. IRON MAN IRA went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his inside, moved clear outside the five-eighths pole, vied near the inside
on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, shook off a foe coming to the sixteenth-pole but was overtaken late while able to get
the place. SORORITY PRANK broke a bit slow, moved up on the outside under urging, made a bid in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on
even terms for the lead, battled with the runner-up under a drive until near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while able to get the show. ROMANTIC
CHARMER was away alertly, pressed the pace on the inside, dropped off the pace while tossing his head a few times outside the five-eighths pole, drafted
inside to the two path under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, pursued the leaders while remaining on his inside lead in
the drive and lacked the needed kick. PALACE BOSS broke a step slow, was urged along towards the rear, moved from four to six wide on the turn,
remained on his inside lead into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. BIG EGO settled under some urging, moved closer with five furlongs to
run, chased four wide on the turn, bumped with a foe outside the five-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. FORGONE broke a step slow, moved out while
urged along, advanced closer near the five-eighths pole, was asked while two then three wide on the turn and tired. BREAK THE FALL brushed with a foe at
the start, moved in while settling off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was roused outside the quarter-pole and failed to threaten. JUDGE RULES

Footnotes
JOEY FRESHWATER forwardly placed from the start, settled four then three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced from the midway point on the
turn into contention when spinning four wide into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths and rallied to collar the leader inside the eighth pole, then
dug in and held on by a neck from a late threat to the outside. NINETYPRCENTMADDIE three then two wide in pursuit, received a few taps to the right
shoulder to keep to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, kicked on
belatedly to the finish and missed at the end. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA three to four wide in pursuit, got let out angled five wide into upper stretch, kept on
under a drive to the finish. STRAIGHT NO CHASER stumbled at the start conceding two lengths to the front before settling into stride and then was put in a
bit tight along the rail by DURANTE, ranged up inside to take command five furlongs from home, showed the way in hand along the inside, remained
patiently handled and cornered two to three wide into upper stretch under intensifying pressure to the outside, got roused with three-sixteenths to go, dug in
under threat a head in front a furlong out, then was collared midway to the sixteenth marker before weakening in the late stages. DURANTE struck the off
side stall at the break, advanced after the start to take brief command five and a half furlongs out before being displaced by the aforementioned foe, chased
three then two wide patiently handled until let out swinging three wide at the top of the stretch, weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
POWER ATTACK came inward while hustled from the gate, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn
in the three then two path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, brushed with the runner-up near the
eighth-pole, dueled outside of that foe in the final furlong and gamely prevailed under strong urging. BORLETTI (IRE) brushed with a foe at the start,
established a good position just off the pace, drafted inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, made a rail bid in upper stretch, dueled inside of
the winner in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the place. KANT BEAT THE ROCK settled off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole,
saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, was roused three wide into the stretch then moved further out, gained in the final furlong
and finished with good courage to get the show. DEVIL'S CAY brushed with a foe at the start, settled towards the rear, moved in late on the backstretch,
saved ground while roused on the turn and improved willingly to get the last spot in the superfecta. HOLDING THE LINE (IRE) brushed with an opponent at
the start, moved up to race just off the pace, switched out near the seven-sixteenths, came under urging while in the four then three path on the turn,
pursued the top two in the stretch and was out-kicked. SCREW LOOSE settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and gained late but missed the supefecta. WARRIOR RICHARD jostled with a rival while carried in early then was taken in hand, angled in
while reserved off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn and failed to threaten. STREET SWAGG settled off the pace, was urged three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and also failed to rally. P MONEY was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the
three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. SHOWDOWN KING jostled with a foe while carried in early
then was taken in hand, settled off the pace, went three wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
ANTIQUARIAN got bumped at the start by DETERMINISTIC, who broke inwards and brushed with THE WINE STEWARD, raced three wide just off the top
pair through the first turn before settling four paths off the rail down the backstretch, remained four wide through the far turn and was placed to coaxing with
seven-sixteenths to run, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the top pair a furlong out, seized command just inside the sixteenth marker
and inched away to the finish to prevail. THE WINE STEWARD got brushed at the start by the aforementioned foe, raced two wide through the opening
bend and then three wide in closest aim of the leader accompanying him from the outside while applying light pressure through his presence down the
backstretch, advanced inside the half mile pole to get on near even terms midway on the turn and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, took over command three-sixteenths from home, dug in briefly between foes before emerging in tandem with ANTIQUARIAN, got
collared just inside the sixteenth pole and fought on to the finish. PROTECTIVE settled tracking the front just off the inside from just off the pace, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, was in behind the leader when approaching the eighth pole and tipped out two
paths for clearance and then ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors. UNIQUE INSIGHT bobbled at the break and came under hustling to
show the way in hand just off the inside under some prompting and the watchful eye of THE WINE STEWARD to the outside, had that rival advance into the
far turn and came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths remaining and
weakened in the late stages. DETERMINISTIC broke in at the start bumping ANTIQUARIAN into THE WINE STEWARD, chased two then three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. NATIVE LAND four then three wide
through the first turn, chased three to four wide coming under encouragement with three-eighths to go, angled five to six wide at the head of the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
RUNNINGWSCISSORS was taken under a tight hold early, went two to three wide on the first turn, raced outside under strong restraint early on the
backstretch, tucked in behind horses with six furlongs to run, went around the far turn in the two path, shifted four wide while roused at the quarter-pole,
rallied to make a bid inside the furlong marker then took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole and moved clear under good handling. BELOUNI (FR) was
eased back nearing the first turn, went four wide while tugging hard on the bit on that bend, was rated off the pace, traveled three wide on the far turn, rallied
to make a bid in upper stretch, drifted in while taking the lead outside the furlong marker, led until outside the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while just
able to hold the place. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE was hustled from the gate, raced in the two path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, saved
ground on the far turn, moved out while asked in upper stretch, chased into the final sixteenth and just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
BODE'S MAKER rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was roused three wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and finished
with late energy to just miss the trifecta. DANCIN IN DA'NILE saved ground on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, went around the far turn in the
two path, was roused four wide into the stretch and improved position without seriously threatening. MAGICAL WAYS settled on the inside, was asked near
the quarter-pole, moved off the inside around the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS went three wide on the first turn,
settled towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the four path, was roused five wide at the quarter-pole and lacked the needed response. CONMAN went to
the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and tired.
AMERICAN LAW raced in the three path on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and came up empty.

BROOKLYN DANTZ was urged along off the pace, moved up between horses to make a bid outside the five-eighths pole, vied in the two path under urging
early on the turn, dropped to the rail later on the bend, dueled with a foe into the final furlong, disposed of that rival into the final sixteenth and prevailed
under steady urging. RAININGATTHEBEACH broke a step slow, moved out then settled on the outside, dropped in outside the half-mile pole, went four
then five wide on the turn, pursued the leading duo in the stretch and willingly earned the place. LUCKY AND GORGEOUS was forwardly placed on the
outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied outside while dropping from the five path to the three path on the turn, dueled with the winner until near the
sixteenth-pole then was outfinished while well clear for the show. SENDERA was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of foes, dropped
back while inside on the turn and tired. THE SPLENDID ONE tracked the pace, made a bid late on the backstretch, dropped from the four path to the two
path on the turn and came up empty. ONCE AN EAGLE angled in towards the rear, was urged along at the back, saved ground on the turn and faltered.
