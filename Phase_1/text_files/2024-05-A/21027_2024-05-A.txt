Footnotes
IRISH WIZARD rated the early pace, came under pressure from the three eighths pole and contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, dug in
under steady stretch encouragement and held on well. BIG JOE B became fractious in the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in
from the head of the lane to take second the final strides. STREAKALIGHTNIN gave chase, raced close two deep while between horses on the turn and
was nipped from second the final strides. UNCLE PRESS veered in and made contact with Cedar Runs Fiber leaving the gate then gave chase, raced close
three wide on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. BID ON BLUE was bumped leaving the gate, angled out to give chase, raced
in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. CEDAR RUNS FIBER was bumped inward and into Bid On Blue leaving the gate then gave chase,
but weakened off the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
XCELLENT START steadied early then saved ground on the first turn, eased out and closed toward contention leaving the half mile pole, challenged at the
five sixteenths, took the lead two deep while between horses approaching the quarter pole, kept the edge off the rail on the far turn and was steadily
handled through the lane. SPUNMAN raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
steadily improved, raced close in the three path on the far turn but relented the final furlong. NICO LUCKY saved ground on the first turn, gave chase
leaving the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. HUMPTY GRUMPTY had the lead early but was met into the first turn
and stalked from that point, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened stride. HOT FUDGE SONDE
raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened in the lane.
BILLYKUS closed to the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was caught nearing the
quarter and faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
STRONG LIL KOKORO settled inside, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod nearing the quarter, drew clear midway on the far turn and
held on under steady handling. SIMPLY JACK rounded the first turn in the four path then saved ground afterward, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and
steadily improved, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn, steadied mid-stretch but came back in an even finish.
LASTWALKTOFREEDOM stalked off the rail then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod at the three eighths, but was met approaching
the quarter pole, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. AIR MEDAL raced well back saving early ground, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. EISELE settled back in the three and four paths and could only improve his
position. JAZZ WITH DENIS took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, was met nearing the three
eighths and gave way past the five sixteenths. LEG UP raced in the five path the first turn, left the second turn outside and showed little response. OCEAN
STORM raced off the early pace about the three path then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT REGRET gave chase inside, raced at the rail through the turn, took the lead passing the eighth pole and was steadily handled to widen later
yards. SISTER'S DUTY gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail, dug in through the stretch and held on for second. AMERICAN BOUND chased through
the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. TRUE HEIRESS raced erratically early on then gave
chase, rounded the turn about the six path and finished evenly. CASTLE LIGHTS was hustled to the front at the half mile pole then rated the pace, came
under pressure toward the quarter pole, was caught inside the eighth pole and weakened in the lane. SUPER WILDCAT lunged from the gate then gave
chase and rounded the turn about the seven path. MYGIDGETMARIE chased, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened. REINE SECRET saved
ground.
