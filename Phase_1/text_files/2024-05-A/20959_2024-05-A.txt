TABLOID MATERIAL was away alertly from the outside to clear to the rail by the five eighths marker for an unchallenged lead, dictated the pace
unthreatened running around the oval and drew away from all rivals when set down by mid-stretch for the victory. SISTER COUSIN tracked the leader in
this compact field outside rivals in the early going, took up the chase around the bend but could not reel in the winner who had everything her own way on
the front and fought on late to save for the place share at the wire. DIFFERENT DRUM settled on the fence tracking the pacesetter along the backside, was
nestled just behind the frontrunning winner throughout the turn and dueled for the place share just missing on the rail in the end. GRADEVOLE was
unhurried seeing the field on the rail down the backstraight, angled off the fence when roused for run in the three path at the quarter pole but could not get
involved on the outside driving to the finish line.

FAST AND READY broke sharply for the lead getting to the inside, gave way momentarily up top at the nine sixteenths pole, edged away for the outside
pace rival by the quarter pole, opened up at the top of the lane and comfortably came home for the win. TRUE SHOT sat all alone in the third flight in the
beginning, began to pick up horses three wide around foes at the quarter pole and bested the rest but was a distant second at the finish line. CANADIAN
AVRO drifted outwards on the start, prompted the pace shifting to the outside with five furlongs to go, had a slim advantage in mid-backstretch, hounded the
winner outside throughout the turn, could not find more at the quarter pole and faded late to lose the place money in deep stretch. SOUPER ICONIC broke
inwards on the start, had a tracking position on the outside in the early stages, was roused at the three eighths marker making little headway and was one
pace to the wire to settle on the fringes. SCAT FACTOR was void of early speed trailing outside of horses down the backside, could not reach contention
running around the oval and passed a stopping runner through the stretch drive. GARGAS was in tight on the break, tracked the top two on the inside down
the backstretch, came under a ride at the three furlong marker but could not keep pace with the engaged front pair and wilted inside at the top of the lane.
STUD MUFFIN was squeezed at the start, clipped inside rival heels while trying to maintain position leaving the chute, stumbled, tossing the rider and
walked off. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #1 CANADIAN AVRO AND #2 STUD MUFFIN AT THE START RESULTED IN CANADAIN AVRO BEING

NOVEL was patiently nestled on the fence tracking the contesting pair, burst between foes moving out to the two path bidding for the lead turning for home
and tenaciously fought to the wire to win the battle on the rail in a tight photo. WAR PAINTER stalked outside near the rear in the third flight, made a bold
move circling around rivals three wide with five sixteenths left to go, dueled outside nose to nose down the lane and just was outfinished losing the nod at
the wire. PRIMA broke a touch slow at the start, was under a strong hold behind runners at the half, had to wait inside in mid-turn, finally angled out from
behind horses at the furlong pole and willingly finished up to garner third money. HOME FOR A REST had a slim advantage in the early going, put away the
rival who was hounding the pace outside at the quarter pole, could not find more late to hold off the closers and tired in deep stretch for a minor role. LADY
WELLINGTON had a tracking trip outside in the second flight down the backside, shifted out to the four path outside of rivals entering the stretch but lacked
a rally to the wire. RED ELEANOR forced the issue on the outside down the backstretch through the turn, had nothing left to give for the drive and was
swallowed up with runners on either side at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN GAMBLE vied inside, shook clear coming to the seven-sixteenths, drifted out leaving the turn then continued to drift in and out a bit through the
stretch, was all out desperate late but managed to hold sway. VALLEY GIRL tracked the pace from inside, moved out four wide coming to the quarter pole,
was strongly ridden and responded to keep on well outside late but just needed more. NORTHERN RUBY broke just a half-step slowly, settled inside,
advanced on the turn moving off the fence coming to the quarter pole and a bit further still in upper stretch now in range in behind the leader, altered inside
of that one near the sixteenth pole and kept on. LOADED QUESTION settled outside, entered the turn three deep and off the leaders, angled in near the
quarter pole cutting that corner, evened out late. BAYOU BELLE was encouraged from the start, chased mostly two to three wide, went evenly and made no
bid. MAKE NO MISTAKE settled off the pace, raced mostly four to five wide and was never near enough to threaten. AWILDAS TREASURE pressed the
eventual winner from outside two to three wide, dropped back and faded. LITTLE FIRE was slow into stride from the gate, saved ground on the turn, came
out in the stretch, was not a factor. CEFALO stalked in range four to six wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
PIERRE was three deep outside keeping a close eye on the leaders in the early going, loomed three wide with two furlongs to go outside foes, seized
command by the eighth pole and held off the surging runner up narrowly at the wire. GILT EDGE had one foe beaten down the back straight, moved smartly
outside three wide to the leaders at the quarter pole, swung out with momentum five wide posing the main threat at the top of the lane and was closing in
with every stride but came up just short at the finish line with that solid effort. HIGHLAND BLUE was under a good hold tracking the pacesetter between
horses down the backside, dueled with rivals on each side at the quarter pole, could not go on with the top pair at the furlong marker and had enough left
late to hold on saving third money by a narrow margin. AMERICAN DECISION had an inside stalking position near the rear, kept pace with rivals
maintaining position around the bend, moved outside in the four path driving to the wire and surged late almost getting the show money in the end. BEE ME
was brushed inside on the start, settled inside behind the leaders down the backside, waited for room watching the embattled trio with five sixteenths to go,
found a clear path at the top of the lane and finished up mildly to be involved in the three way photo between runners. POPWEISER was brushed inside on
the break, recovered to emerge up top at the half, was clinging onto the lead at the quarter pole and gave way weakening on the fence by mid-stretch.
APEX was unhurried trailing down the backside, shifted just outside but could not get interested running around the bend and could not be a presence in the
stretch running.

Footnotes
SOCIETY'S KAT patiently tracked the top pair down the backside, moved three wide at the quarters gaining on the leaders, took control turning for home
and was going away smartly at the finish. BEDAZZLE ME was allowed to settle on the fence near the rear, was asked for more nicely picking up runners
just outside mid-turn, swung out to the four path at the top of the lane and determinedly chased the winner home. LIVIN ON LUV was on the rail in the
second flight tracking the contesting pair, was encouraged right handed at the quarter pole found a seam in the three path with a furlong to go and ran on
willingly to be third crossing the line. WEEHAWKEN broke out to begin, settled between foes near the rear in the beginning, saved ground seeing the field
on the turn, swung out to the five path gaining on runners and finished up with intent to be on the fringes. SWINGING MANDY stalked outside in the third
flight early on, made a brief rally outside three wide at the three eighths marker, could not sustain the run and stalled in the six path by mid-stretch. OLIVIA
ROSE hounded the pace inside down the back straight, dueled on the rail setting the pace throughout the turn and gave way on the fence in the final eighth.
ANAM CARA had one foe beaten three deep outside horses in the beginning, was roused to go three wide with three eighths from the wire, offered a mild
rally until the quarter pole, was fanned seven wide for the drive and had little finish down the lane. HOT CARGO had a slim lead outside down the
backstretch, was pressed inside battling up top around the bend and could not find more turning for home and retreated with runners on either side at the
furlong pole.

Footnotes
QUEEN MACHA stalked outside horses three deep down the backside, inched closer three wide around foes through the turn, was confidently handled
continuing to circle five wide getting the lead at the top of the lane and was kept to the task to hold off the closers at the finish line. VERI GIZMO co-trailed
inside down the back straight, saved ground while closing the gap around the bend, slipped through on the fence turning for home, split rivals at the furlong
marker and surged in deep stretch for the runners up share at the wire. HAY HAY PAULA co-trailed on the outside in the beginning, made a good run
behind the eventual winner five wide at the quarter pole and finished up well just missing the battle for second money. MI CORAZON was situated on the
inside stalking in the third flight along the backside, was nudged in the two path with a quarter left to go, swung out five wide off a tiring early leader in mid
stretch and came on running when clear in the late stages. TIVALI was tracking just behind the contesting pair into the turn, was scrubbed on at the quarter
pole to be in the mix four wide straightening out for the drive and was one paced with a furlong remaining. SOUPER SINCLAIR tracked the pacesetter who
broke sharply down the backstretch, moved in to battle for the lead at the three furlong marker, edged clear briefly at the quarter pole and wilted between
foes in mid-stretch. MICHELE M. got a flyer to quickly be on top out of the gate, was headed on the outside by the three furlong marker, chased the leader
at the quarter pole and stopped in the final sixteenth inside.

Footnotes
PLAY THE MUSIC settled off the pace, raced two to three wide coming past the quarter pole about mid-pack, moved out a path in upper stretch for room
between foes and quickly shot clear then held under steady handling. PEACOCK LASS settled off the leaders, saved ground inside through the turn, came
out in upper stretch for room and having found it kicked on well but too late while clearly best of the rest. DOLCE SOPRESA settled off the pace outside
nearly mid-pack, went four to five wide on the turn, was guided out eight to nine deep at the top of the stretch, kicked on well. BABY NO WORRIES settled
well back of the leaders early racing outside, fanned eleven wide turning into upper stretch and gained mildly late. BLIND SPOT was bumped into a rival at
the start, settled just off the leaders, made a rapid sweeping move fanning from four to seven wide turning for home, loomed a threat just at the leader in
upper stretch but could not sustain the effort and evened out while drifting in late. JOKES UP was bumped at the start then steadied, settled off the pace just
off the inside, shifted seven wide leaving the turn, ran on mildly to improve position. AWESOME TREAT appeared to brush the gate and was consequently
away a step slowly, switched out off the inside and advanced to mid-pack up the backstretch racing two to three wide into the turn, lost some position
turning for home, kept on in the stretch to improve position late. ACCOMPLISHED GIRL bumped a rival at the start but was well-positioned heading up the
backstretch, stalked three wide into the turn, was given encouragement past the five-sixteenths, floated out a path leaving that bend, faded in the stretch.
SPEED TRAP bumped with the outside rival at the start then was bumped the by inside foe and had to steady at that point when in tight, settled at the back
racing off the inside, passed tired foes. TIME FOR AN ANGEL bumped the outer rival at the start, stalked mid-pack three to four wide, came out a bit in
upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. SUNDAY SHOES was bumped into a rival at the start, was close up stalking four wide early, floated six wide
coming out of the turn, faded in the stretch. THE ARCADIAN WAY sped clear and shifted in to set the pace near but off the rail, drifted out a bit leaving the
turn, was overtaken at that point, faltered and faded. CANADIANSWEETHEART chased from inside, was in a bit tight having difficulty cornering leaving the
turn at the top of the stretch, failed to rally. TRADING BAY exchanged a bump at the start, was up close heading to the turn stalking from outside foes five
wide, floated seven deep leaving the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
MRS. GREEN was outside settling near the rear, shifted to the rail at the seven sixteenths saving ground around the bend, closed strongly up the fence at
the quarter pole, surged to the lead on the rail by the furlong marker and cruised home for the score. PLEASURE'S GOLD had an ideal trip sitting all alone
watching the trio battling up front, waited with nowhere to go behind the leaders in upper stretch, followed the winner who got the jump, up the rail at the
eighth pole and ran on to be second best on this day. TITO'S CALLING trailed on the inside in the early going, was roused catching up to the field three
wide by mid-turn, swung out widest in the five path at the top of the stretch and under left handed urging got up in the final strides for third money. OWEN'S
TOUR GUIDE was hustled on the rail leaving the chute to contest the pace inside, battled head to head with two outside runners going around the turn,
fought on just off the fence turning for home up front, could not quicken in deep stretch with others and just missed holding for show.
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES was away alertly for the lead, then dueled three wide on the outside down the back straight, continued three wide forcing the issue
around the bend, had a chance while still in the hunt four wide straightening for home but tired in the late stages. TOERIS prompted the pace with rivals on
each side down the backstretch and through the turn, was still fighting on three wide at the top of the lane but could not offer a late kick and gave way late.

Footnotes
STOLEN was shuffled a touch running on the rail at the half mile marker, recover to improve position to settle in spot on the rail going into the turn, angled
out moving to the leaders three wide at the quarter pole and drew off in the lane for an impressive score. ROOKIE COURT was under a snug hold tracking
the top two after the break, started a run on the fence by the quarter pole and had a good rail rally at the furlong marker to best the rest but was a distant
second behind a dominant winner. KRYPTO GAINS travelled in the third flight outside in the beginning, was roused at the quarter pole to be in the hunt for a
share turning for home and ran on well late to settle for third money. HOT OMELET was hustled from the outside to clear to the lead getting to the rail, was
still loose up top running through the turn, was collared outside by the winner at the eighth pole and faded late for a minor role. MY ASSISTANT chased the
pacesetter in the backstretch through the turn and evened out with rivals on each side in the three path at the furlong marker. SPEEDY JOHNY was pinched
at the break to trail early on, advanced on the fence with five sixteenths to go picking up runners but could not threaten running down the lane. FEW
REGRETS settled near the back of the pack four deep outside horses, offered a mild rally four wide in mid-turn and had little to show in the drive to the wire.
ORIGINAL ME travelled in midfield between foes down the backside, could not quicken with others throughout the turn and could no be a factor in the
stretch running. MIZZ GEMMA stalked between foes near the rear, lost ground and position around the oval and lacked a finishing rally in the lane.
