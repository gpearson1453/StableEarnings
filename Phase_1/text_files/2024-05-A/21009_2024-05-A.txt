Footnotes
FOXY SISTA took an immediate lead and rated the pace, kept the advantage over Bull's Legacy when challenged toward the three eighths pole, was
prompted into the far turn then steadily handled to hold off the stretch challenge of JUMPIN JACK BRASS, who was rated close inside on the opening turn,
picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then eased out and challenged toward mid-stretch, but hung the final
sixteenth. YES TO LOVE rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in
the lane. BULL'S LEGACY stalked the early pace from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded in the three path on the far turn.
FRENCHIES GOLD saved ground. LUCKY BOP saved ground into the first turn, moved to the outside entering the backstretch and gave chase toward the
seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path.

turn near the rail and was only intermittently handled in the stretch. HARDLY EVER BETTER had a brief early lead then gave chase, raced off the rail on the
turn and finished well to close the gap. ESTRELLA FUGAZ gave chase toward the inside, entered the turn near the rail, eased out leaving the turn and ran
evenly in the lane. JUST A FLIRT gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path then lugged in through the lane. BEAR'S ESTATE gave chase, raced in

True Buckpassing, cleared that one leaving the eighth pole and held on well with steady handling. SMART WINDSOR was bumped outward and into Count

flank of the winner. PRINCESS OF GOLD gave early chase toward mid track, rounded the turn in the five path, left the turn outside and finished well to take
third under the wire. TRUE BUCKPASSING came away with a brief early lead then pressured the pace, contested at near even terms two deep on the turn

passed some rivals in an even finish. COUNT THE FLOWERS was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed
little in the lane. K'S LANEE was bumped sharply outward and into Smart Windsor leaving the gate then gave chase, but faded at the rail on the turn.

JUDGEMENT DAY stalked off the rail the opening turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead toward the five sixteenths, raced clear
at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. DORADO stalked from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail
on the far turn, but ultimately, had to settle for second best. MAKIN' GOLD rated the pace inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and
was caught approaching the five sixteenths pole, dropped back at the rail into the far turn and flattened stride. TREASURER settled in the four path the
opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened in the lane. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE
exchanged contact with GRUMPY'S BUDDY leaving the gate then saved ground while racing well back, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. The latter exchanged contact with Kaylee's Spitfire leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the
three path, left the turn outside and showed little response. SCARE DEM raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn toward the outside and never
factored. KARMA BUS saved ground just off the pace, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG SMILE took a quick lead while angling to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, extended his lead into the
far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. RAINBOW DAY saved ground off the pace, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn near
the rail and settled for second best. LOST WEEKEND saved ground on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn then
flattened in the lane. HERE COMES RUSTY settled in the three path the opening turn, gave chase past the half mile pole, raced in the three path on the far
turn and weakened in the stretch. LIGHTNING LAD saved ground into the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the
far turn about the five path, left the turn widest and showed little more. GOLDEN ADAGE settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. ZAP MAN raced off the pace about the three path on the first turn then
faded past the seven sixteenths pole. AIR KENNEY stalked from the five path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the
six path on the far turn. GLENHOLME came away awkwardly, rounded the first turn about the five path then faded through the backstretch.
