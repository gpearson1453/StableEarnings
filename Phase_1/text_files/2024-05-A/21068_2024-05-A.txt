Footnotes
GIFT GORGEOUS tracked the pace early on outside the early leader, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid three wide in the stretch, was under a
long drive down the lane and prevailed in the final stages. DEFAULT stalked the pace early on near the rail, was in the two path into the lane, made a bid
down the lane under a long drive but did not have enough in the late stages. NO CONSEQUENCES raced back early on near the rail, shifted into the three
path entering the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. BEAUTIFUL MANDATE broke through the gate in the pre-start, chased the pace early on, was
in the four path into the lane while shuffled back and came again late in the stretch from the inside. LA PICASITA set the pace early on, was on the inside
into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive. INSPECTOR PENNY was never a factor. JOIA RARA chased the pace early on, was in the five path into
the lane and empty down the lane.

HE'S GOT THIS bobbled at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, pursued behind the leaders while well in hand around the far turn, tipped four wide
to take aim entering the lane, bid and gained an advantage at the furlong grounds then edged ahead. YONO broke outwardly into open space, tracked from
the three path, bid three deep at the three furlong pole, vied two wide leading narrowly into the lane, but was bested by an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds, fought on and secured place. BIRD KING bumped the gate and broke slow, lagged in the three path, cut the gap in the four path around the far
turn, got carried out to the seven path by an injured rival entering the lane, then rallied willingly to gain show late. DOCTOR NASH stalked outside of the
pace setter, bid along with an outer rival at the three furlong pole, dueled with that one entering the lane, but yielded to that one and a wider bidder at the
furlong grounds and lost show in the final sixteenth. OUTLIER showed the way along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders leaving the three
furlong pole, gave way nearing the lane and faded. THE REDS pursued from off of the pace in the three to four path, advanced into striking range entering
the far turn, but suffered an injury entering the lane, got pulled up in midstretch and was taken off the track in an equine ambulance.

IMPLICATED tracked in the three path, bid three deep around the far turn, cleared entering the lane and drew off under a drive. HURRY UP HANNAH broke
a step slow, settled off of the pace two wide after getting briefly keen around the first turn, came under urging in the three path turning for home before
tipping four wide entering the lane, then ran on in pursuit of the clear leader to prove second best. RO TOWN stalked in the two path, bid outside of the
leader along with an outer rival turning for home, failed to keep pace with that one nearing the lane, got outkicked by a wider rival for place in upper stretch
and safely held show late. BALI BELLE broke slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted out to the four path while at the rear entering midstretch and stayed on
to reach fourth late. BREEZE EASY (GB) tossed her head leaving the gate, tugged clear in the three path into the first turn, tucked to the inside into the far
turn before meeting a pair of outer challenges, got headed by those rivals at the five sixteenths pole and weakened. BLING raced off of the pace along the
inside, got keen into the first turn, tracked behind the leaders from the two path around the far turn, shifted three wide and between horses entering the lane

YES TO CHAMPAGNE showed the way along the inside, dictated terms in hand with a subtly clear margin around the turn, drew off under a drive in upper
stretch and was put to wraps late. AMY Z stalked three wide, got floated to the four path at the three furlong pole, before tucking back to the three path
turning for home, but was no match for the clear leader and held place. CLASSIC MYSTERY broke in a tangle and was off slow, trailed the short field in the
two path, moved out to the four path leaving the three furlong pole, gained show from inner rivals entering the lane but was fended off for place thereafter.
CHARM OF THE SONG raced forwardly two wide and between horses, floated to the three path in to the turn, but yielded in tight quarters among foes
nearing the five sixteenths pole. GOURMET leaned back just before the gate sprung, then lost balance with his hind end upon breaking many lengths slow,
rushed forward to track along the inside, tipped to the two path at the three furlong pole, but faded nearing the lane.

GAME WARDEN broke a step slow at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, shifted four wide at the nine sixteenths pole, progressed along with an
outer rival to bid at the half mile pole, but bumped an inner rival and got outmoved by his outer counterpart at the station, sustained pursuit from the three
path around the far turn, shfited outside of the leaders and to the five path in upper stretch, launched a grinding rally and drove past the leaders at the
sixteenth pole. ROUTE RUNNER stalked two wide, bumped an outer rival while getting outmoved by a wider bidder at the half mile pole, stalked the new
leader from the two to three path around the far turn, ranged up to bid entering upper stretch, vied as an outer rival joined the fray in midstretch, but got
outkicked by that one at the sixteenth pole and secured place. GAME KEEPER laid off of the pace in the four path, floated to the five path at the nine
sixteenths pole, progressed in the aftermath to offer an early bid for the lead at the half mile pole, gained an advantage before tucking to the two path
around the far turn, met an outer challenge in upper stretch, dug in and battled through midstretch, but was bested by a wider bidder at the sixteenth pole
and yielded place. RUNNINGFORJOY broke outwardly, raced at the rear in the two to three path around the first turn, shifted out and gained in the five to
four path into the far turn, sustained progress to take aim on the leaders in upper stretch, but flattened out while getting outkicked by an outer rival in
midstretch and chased through the final furlong. HAWKS CREEK laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn and moved
up without menacing. B SUDD showed the way along the inside early on, but was headed by an early bidder leaving the half mile pole, stalked the new
leader around the far turn, but chased entering the lane and faded. WESLAN broke a beat slow, tracked along the inside, pursued from further back in the
two path around the far turn and made little impact. BALANTYNE tracked three deep, but was bumped between rivals and pinched back from crowded
quarters at the half mile pole and faltered.

Footnotes
TAPIT SHOES stuttered a step leaving the gate, tracked along the inside, tipped three wide at the half mile pole, bid three deep turning for home, bumped
an inner rival forging an advantage entering the lane, bumped that one again shaking free into the final furlong and held sway from pursuers on either side.
APOLLO RISING laid off of the pace two wide, got floated to the four path at the half mile pole, pursued from the three path around the far turn, tipped to the
six path to take aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, but was fended off through the final furlong and prevailed over an inner co-chaser for place.
CAROOM raced at the rear two wide, pursued between horses into the far turn, surpassed an inner rival and tucked to the inside around that bend, but was
shuffled back behind a tiring foe entering the lane, managed to slip through in upper stretch, offered a rail charge to take aim inside of the leader in the final
furlong, but needed more and missed place. BERRETTINI vied two wide before clearing off into the first turn, led in the two path inside of a pair of bidders at
the three furlong pole, but yielded to those rivals at the quarter pole and faded between horses. DISSOLVED prompted along the inside before stalking his
outer counterpart around the first turn, rebid outside of that one along with an outer rival at the three furlong pole, took contact from his outer counterpart
while getting headed entering the lane, was bumped again by that one at the furlong grounds and yielded. EL AHIJADO saved ground off of the pace and
faded.
