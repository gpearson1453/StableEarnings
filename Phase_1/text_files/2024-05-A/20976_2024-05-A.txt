Footnotes
THEDA'S BOY started slow and allowed a trio of horses to dictate the pace for approximately two miles. With three quarters to run he was put under urging
picking off rivals to take command. One late effort from OLD STYLE HUMOR fell flat. OLD STYLE HUMOR (IRE) ran the most even race of the field. Sitting
behind pacesetter POST WAR, he allowed him to control the early going. Made a move with three quarters left and was greeted by the winner alongside
who captured the lead. Made one last effort which didn't materialize. GLENCORRIB SKY (IRE) started the early going behind them all and edged closer
over time; made its move to join top two but was no match. DE GREY GUY (IRE) began in the middle of the pack and stayed there throughout. Attempt to
gain shot; failed late. PRIDE OF ERIN (IRE) raced last at every point of call. POST WAR was the principal pacesetter from the get and enjoyed a clear lead
and looked strong; With less than a mile to go, POST WAR unseated his rider over a fence. Walked off. ISLAND NATION (IRE) Pulled up midway through
the contest; walked off.

Footnotes
FAST VISION (FR) Stalked the pacesetter in early going, about halfway in made a move to the lead which was held for a short period of time until they
turned from home and he drew clear of them all. HARD GAME took the early lead until challenged by ultimate winner. With about a mile left he contested
that lead, and took over. Turning for home it was clear he was outmatched by winner. HEY TEACHER (GB) allowed the field to dictate terms and didn't
catch one horse until late. Was never a factor. SOROLLA showed very little. DRUID'S ALTAR (IRE) began the race in the middle of foes then fell; walked
off.

Footnotes
FASHION LINE sat behind HUYANA for the whole race until the last three quarters when asked to run gradually moved closer to the leader then took over
that top spot. Once he had, they weren't going to catch him. HUYANA went straight to the front and led the way for most until midway through and winner
was challenged by ELUSIVE EXCLUSIVE and the trio raced as a tandem for a furlong until he put him away. ELUSIVE EXCLUSIVE (IRE) made one move
to the challengers and seemed in the mix, then stopped.
