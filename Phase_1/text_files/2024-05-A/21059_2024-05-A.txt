Footnotes
SHE'S NOT A JOKE was away in good order then tracked the leader up the backstretch, edged up to engage ANDREA DIANE with three furlongs left to
run, dueled two wide into the lane, dug in gamely under strong encouragement and edged away deep stretch. ANDREA DIANE sped to the lead soon after
the start, took on the challenge of SHE'S NOT A JOKE three furlongs from home, dueled inside around the turn, battled back gamely into the lane then
yielded in final stages. MISS CLASSIFIED chased the embattled pair into the turn, came three wide into the stretch run and kept on for a share. FLATHEAD
FINALE hustled along in pursuit of the top pair, saved ground around the turn, continued on the rail through the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
BURN JAKEY BURN sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held clear still unleashed around the turn, saved ground turning for home, responded
under a brisk hand ride, widened to a commanding lead and kept to task under a mild drive. DA RINGO hustled along in pursuit of the early leader, chased
two wide around the turn, sustained a two wide bid down the lane and captured place. I'M AN OAK chased the pacesetter into the turn, spun out four wide
entering upper stretch, stayed on with response and just missed place. GABRIEL'S LEGEND was forwardly placed from the onset and raced just behind the
early leader, continued a bid for the eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive. SUPER RENZO lacked speed and raced in the back, saved
ground around the turn and never menaced.

DAWSON'S STORM tracked in range up the backstretch, let out a notch and quickly advanced to engage TEE OFF TIME for the lead mid-way around the
turn, took command turning for home and continued well clear under steady encouragement. TEE OFF TIME vied for the early lead, held a slim advantage
mid-turn then got headed by the eventual winner, saved ground entering the head of the lane and had to settle for second best. MC COUGAR raced off the
early pace, hustled up four wide around the turn, sustained a two to three wide bid down the lane and secured a share. STROLLER BOY lacked speed and
raced in the back, saved ground then tipped two wide at the head of the lane, ran on with interest and gained position. KILLIAN chased off the top flight late
on the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn and lacked a needed rally. JUPITER MISSION raced in range through the backstretch,
weakened around the turn and failed to regain through the lane. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP was forwardly placed from the onset, continued in close range
around the turn then gave way. NAVE vied for the early, failed to keep pace around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
ALLO ENRY set aa pressured pace through early stages, continued to battle for command leaving the backstretch, edged ahead to a slim lead late on the
turn, hustled along into the lane, responded gamely and pulled away. AMERICAIN JOEY was forwardly placed on the first turn and continued in close
contention through the backstretch, ranged up in striking distance three furlongs from home, could not move on with the eventual winner late on the turn,
sustained a steady bid through the lane and held place. GALACTIC EMPIRE was allowed to settle in the back through the early going, moved up closer four
wide mid-way around the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and just missed place. ONE TIME GEM raced near mid-range, urged two wide around the
far turn, shifted out wider for the drive and had a mild improve. CHISHOLM TRAIL saved ground while rated off the early pace, tipped two wide at the head
of the lane and lacked a needed rally. SUBURBAN PRINCE dueled inside of rival around the first turn, continued to battle through the backstretch, remained
up close around the far turn then gave way. GINGER RULES moved up in range mid-way through the backstretch then steadily weakened. FAKE
SOLUTION chased the pace between foes in a compact flight and came up empty in the lane.

PAPA JOJO rated near midpack through early stages, edged closer late on the turn, given cue four to five wide at the head of the lane, dug in willingly under
a drive and drew clear. FLEETWOOD SMACK dueled for the lead from the onset, continued to battle through the turn, shook free and edged ahead turning
for home, got overtaken by the winner near the eighth pole and stayed on for second best. ROCKIN BOOTS raced midpack in the early going, ridden two
wide around the turn, shifted three wide and given cue in upper stretch and sustained bid to secure a share. STUMPY'S LOVE SONG was unhurried,
hustled along five wide into upper stretch and had a mild improve. EDGY LOVER rated just off midpack, was ridden along three wide around the turn and
had a mild improve in the lane. NICE ONE JULIO raced in range through early stagers, rode the rail while poised to strike around the turn, given cue and
roused forward in upper stretch but failed to sustain bid and gave way. OXFORD OUTING tracked the top pair through early stages, launched a three wide
bid around the turn then weakened in the lane. LETS ROCK N STROLL raced off the early pace, came tow wide into the lane and failed to move on.
KICKIN' CHARLIE dueled two wide from the onset, battled back through the turn then came up tired past upper stretch.

Footnotes
MO'S MOJO sat back off midpack through early stages, picked up the pace around the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, steadily edged up close,
shifted out wider, dug in gamely and surged clear. HULEN briefly vied for the lead then edged back and remained forwardly placed off the top pair, crept up
three wide near the quarter pole, took over a slim lead, dug in gamely in the final furlong then got denied when winner surged by late. COLONEL KLINK
settled in good position near midpack, began to edge up closer along the outside late on the turn, given cue four wide entering the upper stretch, responded,
roused forward into striking distance then yielded late. MILTON STREET chased inside through early stages, came two wide around the turn, briefly drifted
out near the eighth pole, came back in under right handed pressure and had a mild improve. MAHOMES raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the
lane and passed tiring foes. HERITAGE PARK raced in range, edged up closer four wide going by the quarter pole, continued in contention in upper stretch
then gave way in the final furlong. BRILLIANT COLORS raced off the pace, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SHIP BOSS dueled for the
lead from the onset, continued to battle through the turn, got collared turning for home and faded in the lane. ALL OVER OLIVER chased in early contention
along the inside then weakened around the turn. WILLET KINDA NIGHT vied for the lead in opening stages, matched strides through the stretch then came
up empty late on the turn.
