MISSCZECH pressed the pace down the backside from between rivals, took a brief lead into the turn, dueled on hte bend for the lead, took command upper
stretch from four wide, drifted in to the three path down the lane causing the runner-up to take up at the eighth pole and kept on in a drive to prevail by a
diminishing head at the wire. FORCE TO REKN WITH chased the leaders through the turn, rallied at the head of the lane from three wide, was taken up at
the eighth pole as the leader drifted in, angled out to the clear and surged late to just miss. PRETTY ARIA hutled up the rail to set the early pace in a three
way duel, lost position on the turn, re-rallied down the lane from the rail andwas outkicked late in the drive. MINE ME trailed most of the way and showed
late in terest in the stretch with a mild bid from eighth wide. U DID IT prompted the pace in a three wide duel down the backside, took the lead briefly on the
turn, drifted out turning for home and tired in the lane failing to respond when called upon. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THE TRAINER
OF FORCE TO REKN WITH CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THE
WINNER AND PLACED HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
TORIADOR broke alertly to quickly take command from the gate,set the pace to upper stretch, responded when challenged by the runner-up, battled to the
wire and prevailed in a determined drive. ASYOUBELIEVE prompted the pace while saving ground through the turn, cut the corner turning for home, rallied
up the fence to duel with the winner through the lane and was denied at the wire in a game effort. GLAVA tracked the leaders to the turn, made a four wide
bid on the bend, brushed inside rival, loomed up at the quarter pole and finsihed evenly unable to sustain the rally. DECOY trailed to the head of the stretch
and made up ground through the lane. SILENT RUNNER tracked the leaders from between rivals on the turn, was bumped on the bend by the rallying
outside rival and faded coming home. QUINTO SOL was not a threat.

LIL ZAPPER broke alertly to quickly take a clear lead, maintained that advantage to upper stretch, drifted out down the lane and kept-on in a drive to repel
all challenges. WRONG SPOT unhurried for the first three-eighths, circled the pack from five wide to mount a belated rally in the stretch gaining on the
winner late. MENDELJOHN (IRE) stalked the pacesetter to upper stretch, rallied three wide down the lane, altered course angling in off heels in mid-stretch
and kept on to just miss the place. MONEY MUNCHER tracked the leaders throughout and lacked a closing rally. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH contended tom
idway on the turn from two wide and weakened turning for home. CARRERA CABALLO was not a factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND
THE RIDER OF MENDELJOHN CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN BY THE WINNER, UPON A LENGTHY REVIEW THE
STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

COMMON KNOWLEDGE stalked the pace in a clear pocket through the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and found best stride late to be going away
in deep stretch. JULIUS THE GREAT prompted the pace from two wide to the top of the lane, engaged the pacesetter midway down the lane to take a brief
lead and was outkicked by the winner late. FAST EH sprinted clear early to set the pace, responded when challenged in upper stretch and weakened late in
the drive. CARSON'S LEGACY was unhurried in the early going while racing wide in the clear down the backside, continued wide on the turn and rallied in
the eight path down the lane to be gaining late. BACKSTREET BOBBY chased the leaders through the turn and lacked a closing rally. SMARTY RIVER
PANTS failed to menace. SCHOCHOH was not a threat.
