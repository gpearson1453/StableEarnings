Footnotes
INSATIABLE EVA dueled for the lead along the rail past the quarter pole, was shaken up a bit in early stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best under a hand ride. NOT OVER YET battled with the winner two wide to the quarter pole then was no match while well clear for second. CAP
IS BACK trailed into the stretch then had a mild late rally two wide. DO NOT PASS veered in at the start and was no threat. MARVELING hopped at the
start, settled with the second flight along the inside and gave way in the stretch.

GILES unhurried for five furlongs, closed willingly four wide into the stretch, made the lead near the furlong marker and drew off under confident handling.
HAD RIGHT never far back, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner. KLAATU set the pace around the clubhouse turn,
was headed before a half, dueled along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE hopped at the start, advanced steadily
four wide to gain a slight lead before a half, dueled two wide into the stretch then came up empty. GEH SCHNELL was no factor. RUBINSTEIN chased the
early pace and was through after a half.

AFERDITA always within striking distance, rallied four wide into the turn to make the lead at the five sixteenths marker, set the balance of the pace and drew
off under left handed urging to win as much the best. CONSTITUTIONALIST never far back, had a mild rally in the six path into the stretch and finished
clear second. PRINCESS HALIME vied for the lead along the inside and went evenly. BOOGIE BOOGEE failed to menace. TRITONE GAL pressed the
pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. BAREBACK FUN was hustled to the front soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the rail into the
turn then was used up.

stretch then drew off under right handed urging to win as much the best. MY BROTHER CAM away alertly, set a pressured pace two wide to the top of the
stretch then was no match for the winner while just hanging on for second. ICE BLAST stalked the early pace three wide, dropped back on the far turn then
came on again late three wide and just missed getting up for second. GRAN ANDREWS press the pace along the rail into the stretch, altered course to the
four path nearing the sixteenth pole then faded. AULD LANGE SYNE was no threat.
