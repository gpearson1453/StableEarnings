Footnotes
RUNAWAY JOKE raced forwardly three deep, took light contact from an inner rival nearing the half mile pole, stalked the clear leader from the two path
around the turn, bid entering the lane and drew off under strong hand urging. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN broke out and bumped a rival at the start, raced
forwardly along the inside, brushed an outer foe in pursuit of the clearing leader approaching the half mile pole, got a bit keen into the turn, chased from the
two path recovering stride around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch and stayed on to claim place in the final sixteenth. AIR FORCE
CRUISING leaned into an outer rival at the start, sped clear down the backstretch, dictated terms around the turn, met an outer challenge entering the lane,
but proved no match for that one in upper stretch, yielded and lost place late. WHOLEHEARTEDLY was off slow and shied from an inner rival at the start,
raced towards the rear three wide and between horses into the turn, was briefly held up behind a rival before tucking two wide turning for home, then moved
up while hanging on his left lead. MUNYHUNGRY broke slowly, lacked speed two wide and between horses, moved to the inside turning for home and
failed to menace. BEEZER was unsettled in the starting gate, broke well but was quickly outsprinted by inner rivals in the opening stages, raced well back
four wide into the turn and made little impact. SCAT DANZ transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer rival before being bumped by his outer
counterpart once again shortly after, raced at the rear along the inside, checked in tight along the fence at the three furlong pole and was outrun thereafter.
WILD WEST JUSTICE was bumped by an inner rival at the start before shouldering that foe early on, raced forwardly in the tow path, but was brushed by
an inner foe into an outer rival while subtly put to tight quarters between them nearing the half mile pole, chased from the three to four path around the turn
then weakened between horses in upper stretch. GUILTY AFFAIR was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace under urging in the three
path around the turn and tired.

LATE NITE LIZZIE stalked two to three wide, offered a bold bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, assumed command in the four path in upper stretch
and drew off under a drive. ESME vied outside of a rival and in the four to three path down the backstretch, led narrowly in the two path around the turn, but
proved no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch and safely managed place. SHE'S MAGIC stalked along the inside, shifted out to the three path
entering the lane, but only managed to chase the top pair thereafter and lasted for show late. I GOTTA BOLT trailed in the three to four path around the turn,
floated to the six path in upper stretch, then ran on mildly to miss show at the wire. BLUE GUITAR vied along the inside, but yielded to a pair of outer rivals
entering the lane and faded.

Footnotes
KATHYNMARISSA pursued from midpack in the two path, tracked between horses into the far turn, was roused turning for home to bid outside of the top
pair entering the lane, gained an advantage in midstretch, flopped back to her left lead leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. LAST CALL showed the
way along the inside, but was bested by a outer bidder in midstretch and narrowly saved place. BOSS LADY BAILEY saved ground at the rear, split foes in
teh four path to launch a rally in midstretch and offered a late kick to miss place at the wire. JOHANNY stalked along the inside, bided time from the pocket
around the far turn before getting outmoved by an outer rival nearing the lane, awaited for the pace setter to vacate the rail while committing to an inside
charge in upper stretch, audibled when that hole did not materialize and altered course three wide at the furlong grounds, but lacked the needed kick to offer
a bid. CATMINT stalked three wide, got outmoved and floated four wide by an inner foe entering the lane, then gave way. BAG LADY pressed two wide and
weakened between horses in upper stretch. JE SUIS RAPIDE laid off of the pace in the three path around the turns and was outrun.

Footnotes
GREEK HEIRESS raced at the rear along the inside coming under firm restraint behind foes at the nine sixteenths pole, steadied before shifting to the three
path into the turn, gained inside of rivals moving to teh six path entering the lane, then rallied widest to bid at the sixteenth pole, vied late and prevailed. YO
PUEDO prompted along the inside, stalked approaching the turn, awaited racing room momentarily before slipping through inside of the early-pace setter
appraohing midstretch, bid inside of rivals in the final furlong, vied late but missed. DE' ANS EIGHTY was bumped and floated outwardly by an inner rival at
the start, stalked in the five to three path into the turn, bid in upper stretch, led approaching the furlong grounds, but met challenges on either side in the final
furlong and was outfinished between horses. SISTER KISSES pursued from midpack along the inside, then in the two path around the turn, shifted to the
four path and between horses in upper stretch, then chased the leading trio through the final sixteenth. OUTOFNOTHINGATALL broke out and bumped a
rival at the start, forged forward between horses to set the pace in the four path, moved down to the two path approaching the turn, led before getting
headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch, then weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. PROTOMAGIC pursued from midpack in the six path,
took closer order to track in the four path around the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and faded. RED HOT JEANIE pursued from midpack in the
three to four path and between horses around the turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and tired. WILD ACCLAIM laid off of the pace in the seven to
five path into the turn, fanned back to the seven path entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
VERACRUZIN tracked in the three path, bid outside of the leader turning for home, forged a narrow advantage in upper stretch, dueled with his inner game
counterpart through the final furlong and clung to his advantage. MACAW vied four to three wide, inched closer tucking to the two path at the three furlong
pole, met an outer challenge turning for home, got headed by that one in upper stretch, yet fought on doggedly thereafter but gamely missed. CHULLIGAN
pursued from midpack in the two path, shfited out to the four path with three furlongs to go, advanced to gain show turning for home, then chased the
embattled leading pair home to prove best of the rest. PHENOMENAL DREAM was off a beat slow and brushed with an outer rival at the start, trailed in the
four path, advanced around the turn before fanning to the five path entering the lane, but leveled off and held fourth late. PENROD stumbled upon leaving
the gates, raced off of the pace along the inside, moved to the three path entering the turn, encountered traffic entering the lane in the four path, altered to
the six path in upper stretch and moved up. BIG VELVET prompted three wide and between horses early on, failed to sustain position and chased his
counterparts with nine sixteenths to go, pursued from the three path around the turn and failed to factor. BAJAN BOY broke a step slow, lacked speed in the
two path, trailed turning for home then surpassed tired rivals. MAINTAIN vied along the inside, chased outer rivals entering the turn, checked in tight rail
quarters at the three furlong pole, shifted to the two path shortly after and tired. FRIO RIVER laid off of the pace in the three to two path, moved between
horses turning for home, then chased along the rail and tired. KALL KARL brushed with an inner foe at the start, vied two wide and between horses, but
failed to keep pace with an outer rival into the turn and weakened along the inside leaving the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
GILDED CRAKEN exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the start before steadying out of crowded quarters between horses shortly after, saved ground
well back around the turn, shifted outside of the leading trio while slowly closing in in midstretch, then sustained grinding progress to edge past the leader in
the shadow of the wire. DAZZLEMESILVER stalked three wide, got floated four wide inching closer nearing the lane, bid along with an inner rival in upper
stretch, led into the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer challenger late. SHOW TIME stalked along the inside, tipped two wide nearing the lane, bid
along with an outer foe in upper stretch, but failed to keep pace with that one in the final furlong and got outkicked for place in the final sixteenth.
FLIPARINO trailed in the three path, swung to the seven path into upper stretch and ran on willingly. CANAVALL showed the way around the turn, but was
headed by a pair of outer bidders in upper stretch and gave way. WESTERN GHENT traded bumps with an inner rival before steadying out of tight quarters
early on, tracked forwardly two wide and between horses, shfited four wide and outside of rivals at the three furlong pole, but floated to the six path entering
the lane and tired. CRUISIN AND BOOZIN laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but drifted inwardly hanging on his left lead
and made little impact. ARTWELL pressed two wide, but weakened three wide and between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
ROCK'N A HALO settled well back two to three wide, bumped an inner rival tucking two wide around the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, then
rallied outside of rivals to reel in the new leader in the late stages. ARMY OFFICER tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, shifted to the
five path in upper stretch, offered slow progress to bid at the sixteenth pole, forged an advantage while flopping back to his left lead, but was caught by an
outer bidder approaching the wire. ST. ARMANDS KEY tracked two wide, crept closer three wide turning for home before bidding in the four path entering
the lane, led in upper stretch before changing to his right lead nearing the furlong grounds, but was bested by an outer pair in the late stages.
FUNNYFLAME stalked along the inside, remained pocketed around the far turn, then only offered a rail chase through the lane. EL MATADOR pursued
three wide, then chased evenly between horses. ZVEREV saved ground at the rear, took mild contact from an outer rival around teh far turn, shfited out to
the three path entering midstretch, but was blocked entering teh final sixteenth before slipping through traffic. FORTUNE SELLER pressed two wide, vied
around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch and yielded between horses. GORILLA TREK rated off of the pace three to four wide
around the first turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane and lacked a rally. TIFAREEH laid off of the pace along the inside, then in the two path around
the far turn and failed to factor. BOLT AT MIDNIGHT laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, retreated to trail into the far turn, then surpassed
tired rivals. NGANNOU showed the way along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn and faltered between horses in upper stretch.
CEEPEEGEE stalked three deep and faded between horses around the far turn.

CURLIN'S GESTURE popped open the stall doors pre-race, stalked along the inside, slipped up a vacated rail to bid in upper stretch and drew off. AIR IT
OUT stalked three deep, bid four wide entering the lane, but was outkicked by a rail bidder in upper stretch and secured place in the final furlong. PANCAKE
HOUSE tracked in the three path and between horses, awaited racing room behind foes turning for home, remained blocked through upper stretch, inched
forward between horses in the final furlong to attempt a bid for place, but was kept at bay. PEEK pressed two wide and between horses, bid three deep and
among foes entering the lane, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in upper stretch and yielded. TRUMPTASTIC laid off of the pace in the two path,
shfited to the four path around the turn before fanning to the six path entering the lane, and ran on mildly between horses. MANDALORIAN broke a step
slow and was bumped and bothered by rivals at the start, pursued from off of the pace in teh four to five path, fanned to the even path entering the lane and
stayed on willingly. PURSUIT OF POWER pursued from midpack four wide, entered the lane in the five path and gave way. ROUSSETTE broke out and
bothered rivals at the start, lacked speed two wide, shifted to the three to four path in upper stretch and failed to menace. BEBEDOURO showed the way
along the inside, vacated the rail entering the lane and weakened between horses hanging on his left lead. BRIO pursued from the two path and tired.
WAYLON was bumped and bothered by an inner rival and hindered an outer foe at the start, lagged behind around the turn and was outrun.

and remained clear of show. WARRIOR JOHNY tracked the leading trio form the four path, stalked in striking range three deep around the far turn, but was
outkicked by an inner rival while chasing in upper stretch, then lasted for show late. CLASSIC CATCH trailed in the two path, moved out of last in the three
path around the far turn, swung to the five path entering the lane, stayed on outside of rivals and missed reaching show. GASOLINE took contact from an
inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, pursued from the three to four path around the far turn, stayed on along with an outer rival late and
needed more to id for show. CONFIDENCE GAME prompted three to two wide, but faded between horses turning for home. HAYES STRIKE broke a beat
slow and bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and tired around the far turn.

Footnotes
TWIRLING QUEEN exchanged bumps with an outer rival at the start, raced close up inside of the leading pair before stalking approaching the turn, took aim
outside of them and from the four path in upper stretch, bid and forged an advantage passing the furlong grounds, drove clear and held late. TOUPIE traded
bumps with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the two path, shfited out to the five path passing the three sixteenths pole, changed to his right lead in
midstretch, sustained slow progress in pursuit of the clear leader in the final sixteenth but needed more. CLOUDWALKER settled off of the pace in the two
path, rallied in the four path and between horses entering the final furlong, attempted an inside bid for place but was denied. NICE AS PIE was slow into
stride, lacked speed in the two to three path, swung to the six path into upper stretch and stayed on willingly. BIG TROUBLE pursued from midpack along
the inside, chased before being able to vacate the rail in the final furlong, but lacked a bid. PIPIT saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide in
midstretch and moved up. NIKI NINE DOORS was bumped by an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path, entered the lane five wide
and failed to factor. HOT BEACH showed the way inside of a sternly pressing foe, disposed of that one in upper stretch, but was caught at the furlong
grounds and weakened. TIPSY RUNNER trailed in the two path, shfited out in upper stretch and made little impact. FIBBER veered outwardly at the start,
lacked speed in the three to five path and was outrun. IMABOUTAGO (IRE) bounced off an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, prompted three to two
wide into the turn, but yielded between horses and caved. TIPSY TAMMY was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced forwardly in the three path,
entered the lane in the four path and faltered between horses.
