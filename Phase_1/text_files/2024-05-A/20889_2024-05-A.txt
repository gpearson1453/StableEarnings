Footnotes
TAP IRON FIST unhurried early to be the trailer along the fence, worked his way to the outside while picking up ground on the final turn, circled nine wide
turning for home and closed fast to be up in time. ZOSIAS SHIP rated in mid-pack for the first half, split rivals while making a steady advance on the turn
and finished willingly to be second best. ASPEN LINK set the pace on a clear well rated lead to upper stretch and could not hold on late in the lane. STEEL
GUITAR reserved off the pace down the backeside, rallied five wide in the turn to loom in upper stretch and finished evenly. STARTINI settled through the
first turn well off the leaders, rallied up the backstretch from four wide to be prominent turning for home and failed to sustain the bid in the lane.
CUSTOMERUNHAPPY stalked the pacesetterfrom the fence for five-eighhts and flattened out. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE fracked the pace down the
backside and filed to menace lacking a response when called upon. MY SUGAR FIX chased the leaders early and faded. CRIMSON GLORY was fanned
wide on the first turn and came up empty after half a mile.

AVENDORE unhurried early to trail, raced wide down the backside, rallied six wide on the final turn and steadily advanced to prevail late in the drive. THAT
IS AWESOME broke alertly to quickly take a clear lead, set the pace to mid-stretch and was out-finished late in the lane in a good effort. FREEFORM broke
outward from the gate brushing rival, moved up to prompt the pace throughout, narrowed the margin on the leader in the turn but could not get passed in the
lane finishing evenly. LILY'S CREED broke inward crowding rival at the start, tracked the leaders from the fence through the far turn and weakened in the
lane. SANTANGELO went evenly lacking a rally. INDY LOVER crowded at the start, raced mid-pack down the backside and laced a response when called
upon on the turn. LIKE FINE WINE was not a factor.

CALIBRACHOAMATTERS set the pace from the gate, repelled the challenge of the presser on the turn and drew clear unthreatened in the lane. CUSTOM
CADILLAC tracked the pace through the turn, rallied from five wide turning for home and finished well to gain the place. MINOR DISCREPANCY broke
outward crowding rivals from the gate, straightened away to race mid-pack along the fence through the turn saving ground and rallied well up the rail to just
miss the place. GRACIOUS KAT broke inward leaving the gate, was reserved off the pace and passed weaker rivals in the lane. LOUDERMILK in tight
quarters leaving the gate, raced up to press the pace mounting a bid on the turn and weakened turning for home. HEZA ROYAL CAT crowded at the start,
raced near the rear of the field early and was never a threat.

Footnotes
STEPHANIE'S MARIA settled off the pace in hand early, made a steady advance on the turn to be rallying eight wide at the top of the lane and surged in
deep stretch to be up in time. GETOUTOFDAWAY reserved to race in mid-pack, rallied from two wide turning for home, worked thru traffic diving to the rail
midway down the lane and finsihed willingly to close well up the fence. USAIN D'ORO tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied in upper stretch to briefly
take the lead midway down the lane and was out-finished late in the drive. MOION stalked the pace from the rail through the turn, angled out turning for
home to loom in mid-stretch and finished evenly. BROADWAY STAR rated in mid-pack to the head of the lane and showed mild late interest to be gaining.
OUR GAL LAYLA prompted the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened in the drive. POT'S PAYCHECK wellp laced tracking the leaders from four wide
and flattened out turning for home. BABY JANE slow early to be near the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. R T'S CAJUN LADY set the
pace on a clear lead to the quarter pole and gave way. FRANCESNFRIENDS was not a threat. COAL DANCER stumbled badly to hin knees leaving the
gate and lost all chance from there. KAT'S PRINCESS chased the pace from the rail and faded on the turn.

Footnotes
GOLD MERRITT sped to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a clear advantage and drew away in the lane unchallenged. MUCHO MARVIN rated off the
early pace, circled five wide on the turn to rally on the outside and prevailed in a three way duel for the place. SLITHER stalked the leader from the fence to
the top of the lane, bore out while dueling in the lane, was taken down to the rail off his rival and came on again to gain the show and just miss the place.
WHY JOEY WHY prompted the pace through the turn, battled from between rivals down the lane while in tight quarters and kept on to the wire. SCHNELL
went evenly on the rail posing no threat. DRIVE FOR FUN failed to menace. ADIEU LE CHAT was outrun.

Footnotes
CAJUN CYCLONE set an early pressured pace, opened a clear advantage turning for home and held well through the lane. HUDSON'S DAY slow early to
trail, circled six wide heading for home and closed with a belated rush to be gaining late in the lane. PUT IT BACK DAVE pressed the pace from the fence
through the turn and kept on down the lane lacking a late bid. HIT THE BULLSEYE bumped at the start, raced up from four wide to chase the pace through
the turn and failed to sustain his bid down the stretch. KAH NIGH unhurried early to be near the rear of the pack and made a mild bid in the lane without
impact. I NITA WARRIOR went evenly as a non-threat. AUTUMN ROB flashed speed and gradually faded coming home. BABY'S LAST DANCE was not a
factor.

SONYA KNOWS BETTER reserved off the early pace to be in the rear half of the field, rallied five wide under a long drive and finished well to take control in
deep stretch. HOUSE BOURBON sped to the lead down the lane the first time, opened a clear advantage on a well rationed pace, maintained that lead until
depp stretch when outkicked by the winner late. TONTERIA rated off the pace in the early going, made an early move into the far turn to be prominent
turning for home and finished evenly while just holding the show. MY PAL SWEET tracked the pace through the turn, rallied down the stretch while angling
in for the drive and just missed the show money. SEEHOSS stalked the leaders to the final turn, rallied on the bend to loom at the head of the lane and
weakened down the stretch. SINGLE SHOT slow early to trail the field and passed tiring rivals coming home. JAYS HOLIDAY shuffled at the start to be at
the back of the pack leaving the gate, raced at the rear until the quarter pole and made up late ground without impact. BET AGAIN tracked the leaders
through the turn and faded in the stretch unable to mount a closing bid. RISING KOTO STAR contended early to be fanned wide in the first turn and kept on
evenly failing to menace. MONITOR MILLS prompted the pace for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
TALK OF THE TOWN reserved off the pace to race mid-pack along the fence, made a steady advance from midway on the turn, angled out for the drive in
mid-stretch and wore his rivals down late in the lane. HAY DIDDLE DIDDLE set a pressured pace throughout, battled on gamely through the stretch to
shake free and was caught late in a good effort. BOONE LAND EXPRESS stalked the leaders through the turn, made a bold bid between rivals in upper
stretch and failed to get by the pacesetter. MY UNCLE BILLY tracked the leaders and could only mount a mild rally in the lane. ROCKY BOY unhurried to be
near the rear of the field and showed some late interest through the stretch. CHASING CHAYSE chased the leaders from three wide to the top of the lane
and faded coming home. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS was not a threat. A FOOL FOR CARLOS husteled up the inside away from the gate, steadied entering
the main track, rushed up the inside again to press the pace to the turn, gave way on the bend and was eased to the wire. TAYSOM dwelt at the start giving
the field fifty plus lengths, galloped to the wire and walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START REGARDING TAYSOM, UPON
REVIEW IT WAS DETERMINED HE HAD A FAIR START.
