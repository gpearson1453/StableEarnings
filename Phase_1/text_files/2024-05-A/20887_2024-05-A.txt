ANSWER THE CALL stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, vied in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds and held sway. MITOLE'S
LEGACY tracked along the inside, chased around the turn, ran on two wide to gain place at the sixteenth pole and slowly closed in on the leader late.
SINGSATIONAL pursued two to three wide and among foes around the turn, tipped four wide entering the lane and sustained a mild chase to reel in a tired
rival for show at the wire. BALLADRY took contact from an inner rival at the start, led from an outer prompter into the turn, held as a wider bidder joined the
fray nearing the lane, but was bested by that one entering midstretch, faded and lost show at the wire. JANUARY JUBILEE bumped an outer rival leaving
the gates, pursued four wide and outside of rivals, inched closer under urging around the turn, but floated to the six path entering upper stretch and gave
way. ANAJULIAFOREVER prompted two wide, then between horses around the turn, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
JOHNNY COME LATELY came out shortly after the start, set the pace as an outer rival prompted around the turn, shifted to the three path entering the
lane, inched ahead in upper stretch and held from his persistent outer counterpart. CHARLIE TOLU prompted the pace outside of the eventual winner,
sparred nearing the lane, got floated to the four path entering it, failed to sustain level terms in upper stretch, yet kept on well through the late stages but
was denied. SING SING was slow to stride leaving the gates, trailed two wide, raliled to bid for show along with an inner foe at the sixteenth pole and
prevailed. PREDECESSOR bumped his outer stablemate before brushing an inner rival and being put to a bit of tight quarters between them at the start,
laid off of the pace in the two path, sustained a rail chase to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, but got outfinished. INDIGO WIND prompted inside of the top
pair before checking back entering the turn, chased around the bend, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and yielded. B GRAYSON
was brushed by an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, steadied nearing the lane and made little impact. COMPLEX MUSIC was
bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked two to three wide, got floated to the six path entering upper stretch and tired. CUPID'S THUNDER raced off of
the pace in the four to six path and failed to menace. MISCHIEF HUMOR chased from midpack four wide, then weakened between horses.

Footnotes
TIVERTON stalked along the inside, slipped through to offer a rail bid in midstretch, sparred with an outer rival through the final furlong and prevailed.
QUIET RUSH stalked from the three path, then between horses down the backstretch, was roused in pursuit of the top pair around the far turn, took aim
drifting to the five path entering upper stretch, bid at the three sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner bidder through the final furlong but was denied.
AVAILABILITY vied for the lead with an outer rival, shifted to the two path entering the lane, yielded between bidders leaving the furlong grounds and held
show. CURLINS INCHARGE turned his head inwardly just before the gates sprung and broke a bit slow, trailed along the inside, then in the two path around
the far turn, and willingly moved up inside rivals. ZAPTASTIC raced off of the pace in the three path under a firm hold around the first turn, tugged in the four
path and outside of rivals entering the backstretch, chased widest around the far turn and gave way. MASTER OF THE NITE vied with an inner rival while
tucking from the four to two path around the first turn, sparred around the far turn before getting floated to the three path entering the lane, but hung on his
left lead and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. SPUNS SON raced off of the pace while in the bit along the inside around the first turn,
steadied behind rivals nearing the backstretch, retreated to trail with eleven sixteenths to go and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
CHITWOOD set the pace in the two path as an outer foe applied pressure, then held well and inched away through the lane. FLASH OF GENIUS pressed
the eventual winner from the three path, but was kept at bay through the lane while pulling well clear of the rest. FORGE IN FIRE trailed along the inside
then willingly moved up between horses. PERLIANO was bumped between horses and put to tight quarters among foes at the start, chased from midpack in
the five path and lacked a bid. LAZARUS bumped an inner rival at the start, raced fowardly along the inside, chased around the turn and gave way.
CAMPTON was bumped between horses and steadied out of crowded quarters at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path and made little impact.
SUPERCOOL bumped an outer rival at the start, chased along the inside and tired in the two path around the turn.

Footnotes
GREY STREAK scooted through between horses early on to show the way along the inside, led from an outer presser around both turns, drove clear in
upper stretch and held sway. COOL QUARTET stalked close up along the inside, pursued behind the leaders with run from the two path around the far turn,
tipped to the four path and between horses in upper stretch, then ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole before narrowing the gap on the leader.
ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT prompted outside of the eventual winner, failed to keep pace with that one after getting floated to the three path entering the lane,
lost place while yielding at the sixteenth pole and held show. FERRYBOAT stalked three wide, pursued under urging around the far turn, got floated to the
five path by an inner rival in upper stretch and yielded. ATKINS pursued while keen two wide around the first turn, chased four wide around the far turn,
fanned to the six path into upper stretch and lacked a bid. BOITANO lacked speed two wide and made little impact. CLASSIC KING was outrun along the
inside.

Footnotes
PENDULUM settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, altered course four wide while picking up stride in the final furlong, then surged late to
reel in the leader at the wire. BEDAZZLE 'EM set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch before shifting a path out, held sway through
midstretch, but was nailed by an outer on-charging bidder at the wire. CARNANE (IRE) took contact from an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide,
required urging to sustain pressure along with an outer foe around the far turn, chased the clearing leader through upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead
among foes at the furlong grounds, then kept on willingly to prevail for show. TONALITE stalked along the inside, chased up the rail and missed show.
EMBARK laid off of the pace three wide, was roused to gain four wide around the far turn, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch and lacked a bid. LEO
TORO stalked three deep, pressed within striking range around the far turn, but only managed to chase the clear leader through midstretch, lacked a bid
and yielded between foes late. KISS ME AGAIN hopped into an inner rival at the start, settled well back two wide, took the far turn in the four path before
floating to the five path into upper stretch and moved up. BOLT'S BROAD steadied among foes early on, then made little impact from the two path. CANDY
CRAZE hopped slightly at the start, pulled forward between horses whlie keen moving through the lane for the first time, tracked two wide and between
horses, took the far turn in the three path and weakened between horses. SARANAC LAKE trailed along the inside and never got involved.
PHILANTHROPY saved ground off of the pace and gave way.

MYSTIC PLEASURE broke outwardly, prompted outside of the leader, vied in the three path around the turn, led into the lane, inched clear in the final
furlong and held well. STUNNINGLY stalked two wide and between horses, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch, then chased the leader well but
needed more. ROSWELL stalked along the inside, then ran on two wide and between horses into the final furlong, but was denied place by an outer rival.
MIGHTY MADISON set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed entering the lane, fought on through midstretch but yielded with a sixteenth to go. TAKE
SHAPE pursued from the three path and failed to factor. KLIMT'S MUSE broke a step slow, tracked in the four path and faded.

NEXT stalked two wide, assumed command from the pace setter nearing the three furlong pole, and drew off handily. DAI VERNON saved ground well
back, brushed with rivals while splitting foes through a narrow seam in upper stretch, then edged place leaving the furlong grounds. MASQUEPARADE laid
off of the pace three to two wide, crept closer four wide around the final turn, bid for place in upper stretch but was outkicked by an inner rival for that
position at the furlong grounds. RED RUN transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, chased the clearing leader
from the four to three path around the final bend, brushed with an inner rival while bidding for place among foes in upper stretch, but yielded between horses
at the furlong grounds. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY set the pace, built a clear margin traveling through the lane for the first time, but was collared by an outer
bidder into the far turn, proved no match shortly after and gave way. MASTER GAME trailed two wide then surpassed tired rivals. O P FIRECRACKER took
contact from an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, came under urging in the two path around the final turn, but faded nearing the
lane. DONEGAL FOREVER lunged out and bumped a rival at the start, then steadied behind the leaders while keen into the first turn, settled to track along
the inside, but faded in the three path and between foes around the final turn.

wire. SILENT HEART prompted two wide and between horses into the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, held place
into deep stretch but got nailed at the wire. MANSA MUSA (IRE) brushed an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, but was bothered by an inner rival and
steadied in the five path in upper stretch, ran on willingly thereafter and missed show. SKETCH (IRE) raced at the rear three wide, swung out to the nine
path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. BEAR RIVER took contact from an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the five to seven path, bumped

Footnotes
FAN THE FIRE vied three deep, led in upper stretch, dueled and held. GOD OF WINE vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, sparred with his widest
counterpart through the lane and was bested grudgingly. TIZZY INDY trailed in the two path into the turn, rallied three wide and between horses after
looking to tip wider in upper stretch and sustained progress to miss place. QUARRYMEN laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shfited out to
the five path entering the lane and rallied. DUAL MONARCHY tracked in the four path, took aim entering upper stretch, but lacked a bid and yielded
between foes late. REDHILL saved ground off of the pace to no avail. HIGH HEADED was brushed by an outer rival early on, pursued form midpack in the
four to five path and between horses and failed to factor. WRITEITONTHEICE made little impact being hung in the six to seven path. GAMETIME
GLADIATOR was brushed between horses early on, pursued from the five to six path and faded. SAINT ROCCO vied two wide and between horses, then
faded in upper stretch. NOT LISTENING was bumped by an outer rival and put to crowded quarters among foes at the start, raced forwardly along the
inside, but faded between horses nearing the lane. SUMMER IN AIKEN brushed an inner rival early on, raced off of the pace in the five path and faded in
the three path and between horses around the turn.
