CAPTAIN'S BEST bore in at the start, bumping a foe, dueled outside of a rival, bid on the far turn, drew off and then geared down late. BIGLEY HUGE
stalked the pace in the three path, then had no late bid. SE VALIENTE stalked the pace in the two path before fading in the stretch. A ROD STYLE stalked
the pace in the four path, was steadied at the quarter pole, then faded. COWBOY JUSTICE was bumped, squeezed back and then hopped at the start, bid
in the four path on the far turn and improved position. YOSHIDA'S IMPACT was not a factor. SHOWDOWN JUSTICE dueled inside to the far turn and gave
way. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.

NIGHT KISS hit the gate, angled five wide at the three-eighths pole, rallied and was clear late under mild urging. KEEN ICE SIGHT was off awkwardly,
stalked the pace in the four path, bid late but couldn't hold off the winner. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE broke outward, led in the three path but gave way late.
LOONA LUV pressed the early pace inside, was steadied at the half-mile pole and lacked a late bid. WILD TAPIT was unrushed early and improved position
late outside. DEEP DISH stalked the pace inside before fading in the stretch. FUTURE FLAY bobbled the start, pressed the early pace in the two path
before steadying near the half-mile pole. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE was bumped at the start.

Footnotes
AIR MARSHAL pressed the early pace between foes, settled, rallied late in the five path and was in time under mild urging. RODEO ZONE stalked the early
pace in the four path, bid at the half-mile pole, was clear in the stretch but was caught. MONUMENTALJUSTICE was unrushed early between rivals, then
rallied late in the six path. GIRVIN CITY LIMITS raced inside, brushed a foe at the eighth pole, then had no late bid. LOONY raced in the four path, was
brushed at the eighth pole and had no bid. CHISEL was unrushed early and improved position late outside. FUNTASTIC VOW dueled outside of a rival, bid
at the half-mile pole to be clear but gave way in the stretch. OUT WORK'M bore out at the start and raced evenly. GRACIE'S BOY ROY was bumped at the
start. COWBOY CHURCH saved ground to no avail.
