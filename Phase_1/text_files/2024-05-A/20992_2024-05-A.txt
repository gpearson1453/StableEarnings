O ROMEO broke in front, set all the pace, repelled a bid from TOYI nearing the quarter pole and drew clear late under confident handling. DESTINO with
the second flight inside, had a mild late rally and finished second best. EL BANDIDO trailed into the stretch and found his best stride late three wide. TOYI
chased the winner into the turn, offered a mild bid approaching the quarter pole, kept on into the stretch and came up empty late. THE RED MAN hopped at
the start and failed to menace.

RAINBOW'S PRIDE trailed through the turn, circled his field three wide through upper stretch to make the lead inside the furlong marker then finished full of
run under mild left handed urging to win going away. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY gained a narrow lead at the half mile marker, shook clear on the turn, set the
pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. AURA OF GOLD lacked room behind the top pair at the half mile pole, waited through the turn,
shifted out to the seven path then passed tiring rivals. POKER PARTNER battled for the early lead along the inside, chased the pace through the turn and
weakened late. BUEHLER'S DAY OFF stalked the early pace three wide and was through after a half.
