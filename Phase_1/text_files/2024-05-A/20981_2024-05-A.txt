Footnotes
CHIEF CHEETAH settled off the early going, advanced three wide around the far turn, made a good outside rally through the stretch and just got up under
all out pressure. JUST BATTLE chased the early pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole, was clear inside the eighth pole and just missed in a
game effort. FABLED RULER was unhurried early, raced four wide near the quarter pole, raced from the far outside in the stretch run and rallied gamely to
the wire. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO showed good early foot from the inside and weakened. ALL TOGETHER dropped back to race mid pack, was four deep
near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. ONE MORE BABY was allowed to settle early, saved ground and never was a factor.
THUNDERTAKESDALEAD pressed the early leader from the outside and tired readily.

slowly, lag early on, advanced through the far turn and improved position while racing from the outside. STHEPANIE PRINCESS set a pressured early pace
along the inside and weakened. SMART IZZY shuffled at the start, raced three wide near the quarter pole and never threatened. STEAL ME OVER failed to
