KARA AND COLLEEN led between rivals, was clear past the half-mile pole and drew off, then held sway under mild urging. A DOLLAR A DAY pressed the
early pace inside, settled, then rallied along the rail at the quarter pole and proved second best. COLORMECAIRO bore out at the start, pressed the pace in
the three path, gave way after running a half mile but saved the show spot. WICKED BEAUTIFUL and CAUSE IMA ROSE stalked the pace before fading.
LONE RIDGE raced well back and lacked a late bid. This race had a timing discrepancy or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at
the most accurate time.

RUN RUN RABBIT was bumped at the start, stalked the pace in the two path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled, was clear at the eighth pole, then lasted
under steady urging. STUPENDOUS stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, lacked room and steadied, angled three wide at the eighth pole and
rallied. LILY'S HOME sprinted clear but couldn't last. CATTY CRUISE was off awkwardly and was jostled at the start, raced inside, angled to the four path at
the three-eighths pole, bid, then had no closing move. DEE DEE B stalked the pace in the three path but had no late bid. This race had a timing discrepancy
or malfunction and was re-timed using video technology to arrive at the most accurate time.
