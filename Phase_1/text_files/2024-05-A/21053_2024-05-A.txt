Footnotes
GOLDEN COLE charged up along the inside to lead the way into the turn, then drew clear in the early stretch and held on while in a strong drive to prevail in
the end. TENSAS BOLT chased the pace while two wide, then rallied gamely leaving the turn, gained second position but did not have enough to catch the
the cleared leader. FAST MEDICINE chased the pace from the inside into the turn, then lugged in and out in the early stretch, then kept on for the show
position while in a mild rally. BLINGSTER was fractious and reluctant prior to the start, then was unhurried early, rallied in the upper stretch and came up
empty. SOUPED UP WILDCAT was away quickly, then stalked the emerging leader while two wide, was in hard drive on the turn, was used up and tired in
the late stretch. GO LAUREN GO urged from the inside towards the back of the field and failed to fire in the end.

Footnotes
JACKMAN'S RIDE drifted out after the start, then set the pace from the inside, was under pressure by an outer rival leaving the turn, shook clear and held
sway down the lane. ATRAS was nicely rated outside of rivals and while three wide, then dug in gamely at the top of the stretch to gain second position but
could not catch the leader in the end. AVAILABLE STAR was allowed to settle along the inside, then split rivals at the top of the stretch and found the best
stride to close well for the show prize. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) was impeded at the start, was unhurried early before urging steadily on the turn, rallied in
the stretch and was closing well in the end. TEAM LEADER broke outwardly and brushed rival, then was bumped by the same rival shortly after, raced mid
pack from the inside, rallied on the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. BRUCELEA was allowed to settle while two wide, then came out six to seven
wide leaving the bend, bid in the stretch and came up empty. BRAHMS BOY chased the pace while two wide at an even pace throughout, bid in the upper
stretch but did not spark in the end. STRAIGHT LUCK pressed the pace while in a steady drive into the turn, attempted to gain the lead while in a strong bid
at the quarter pole, couldn't over power the pace setter and gave way in the stretch. SATURDAY'S GOLD was bumped by an outer shortly after the start,
then chased the pace from the inside, was in a strong drive throughout the turn before giving way in the stretch. MY GOLDEN M was brushed at the start,
then drifted inward and bumped inner rival, raced in the middle of the pack while two wide and lacked rallying in the stretch.

MISCHIEF ANGEL went shoulder to shoulder with an outer rival down the backstretch and into the turn, shifted gears at the top of the stretch and pulled
away confidently to prove best. ART QUEEN sparred lightly with an inner rival throughout the backstretch and into the turn, was in a long drive then was out
kicked in the early stretch and was second best in the end. JUST ADORABLE stalked the dueling leaders from the inside while holding third position
throughout and needed more in the end. LEPRECHAUN CHARM veered outwardly, then chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, bid mildly in
the late stretch and came up empty. CAPETOWN CANDY raced from the inside, then came out to the two path to bid mildly on the turn and was no threat.
MIRACLE SHOES settled at the back and failed to rally.

SAY CHEEZ LOUISE laid off the pace while two wide down the backstretch, remained nicely rated throughout the far turn, then dug in gamely in deep
stretch and was up at the wire to prevail. CANDY OAK set the pace from the inside into the first turn, was in a long drive leaving the far turn and almost
lasted to the wire but was caught by SAY CHEEZ LOUISE for a photo finish ending. MARQUETTE WARRIOR was unhurried early, then saved ground
down the backstretch, swung six wide leaving the far turn and closed belatedly and was up for the show prize. TEXAS MOON was allowed to settle along
the rail early, remained well reserved on the far turn, then rallied in the stretch to close well in the end. CONTOUR moved up along the inside to race mid
pack down the backstretch, then angled outward to bid in the upper stretch, brushed foe and kept on down the lane. AIROSILVER AWAY tracked the pace
from the inside while maintaining second position with another rival throughout, rallied in the late stretch then was out finished by rivals from both sides.
KRIK TAK raced mid pack while three wide, was in a mild drive throughout the far turn, was brushed by an inner rival at the top stretch and gave way in the
final sixteenth. CHAINSAW CITY was allowed to settle while two wide towards the back, then came out five wide leaving the far bend to bid mildly in the
stretch and was no threat. GET READY GAL broke outwardly, then chased the pace two deep mid pack, urged eagerly on the far turn and lacked

AZUNIA pursued the pace closely along the inside, then gained command at the quarter pole and drew off in the stretch under a mild hand urge to prove
best. TWO HANDS FULL settled back to chase the pace from the inside, was in a strong drive throughout the turn, then rallied at the top of the stretch and
remained in a gamely drive till the end. JULIARD HONOR stalked the pace while three wide and in third position, then menaced leaving the turn and needed
more in the end and maintained the show prize. CARPE HORSESHOE was unhurried early, then bid leaving the bend while coming out four wide but it was
too little too late. CANDY TAP was allowed to settle along the inside, bid in the late stretch and was no threat. CONFLICTING TALES was away alertly to
set the pace while two wide into the turn, then was overtaken by an inner rival at the quarter pole then continued to give way in the late stretch.

pace from the inside down the backstretch, then moved up from the three path on the far turn to rally in the upper stretch, could not retain bid and gave way
in the end. GOOD SWIMMER broke outwardly, was between rivals in the early furlongs at the back, saved ground down the backstretch from the inside,
then bid on the far turn to rally mildly in the home stretch but it was to no avail in the end. TED settled back early and was no threat in the end. GOLD

Footnotes
SUMMER IN MALIBU chased the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, then menaced in the late stretch to take over the lead in the final yards and held
on determinedly to the wire. BANDERA AZTECA stalked the pace from the inside, then came out to the three path leaving the bend to gain command at the
eighth pole, then was out finished in the final yards and was best for the place prize. COUSIN LARRY saved ground while racing well behind the field down
the backstretch, then bid on the turn, angled out to the five path and closed well for the show prize. BALSA set the pace from the inside, cleared the turn
while being pursued by eager rivals, then was overpowered mid stretch and gave way in the end. LARRY'S LEGEND stalked the pace white two wide, was
in steady drive throughout the turn, then menaced at the top of the stretch and did not fire in the lane. BOUGIE JOE pursued the pace while racing from the
three path closely behind the leader, then bid on the turn while losing some ground and did not spark in the stretch. BLING MOUNTAIN was out run and
made no impact in the end.

Footnotes
SOLECITA raced between the two fields of rivals from the inside, then moved up on the turn while three wide to duel with an inner rival at the top of the
stretch then kicked clear in the final yards to prevail while in a strong drive. HIGH CALIBER CATCH hit the gate at the start while breaking outwardly, then
raced while three wide in the second field of rivals, rallied leaving the turn while improving position in the late stretch and was closing in on the leader but it
was not enough. SARAH P chased the pace while two wide in the early furlongs, then inched up on the turn to vie between rivals, gain command briefly at
the top of the stretch, then dueled with an outer rival and was outkicked in the final yards and missed the place prize. ANNA MARIE veered inwardly and
bumped rival, then raced from the two path while leading the back pack of rivals down the backstretch, then bid mildly from the inside on the turn and kept
on down the lane while in a mild drive. WESTERN SKY broke inwardly, then moved up do duel with an outer rival down the backstretch, could not retain
stride on the turn and gave way in the stretch while urging eagerly. THREAD OF GOLD drifted outwardly at the start, then chased the pace from the inside,
settled back on the turn, re bid in the upper stretch and failed to respond in the end. TWILIGHT STORM was bumped hard at the start, tucked along the
inside and failed to rally in the end. GHURAIR IS JIM raced while four wide in the back field of rivals, then bid from the inside while in a hard drive, drifted
out in the late stretch and stopped. RUBY SOHO led the way from the inside early, then dueled with an outer rival briefly before taking command again at
the three eighths pole, was challenged once again by outer rivals at the quarter pole, was hard used and tired in the stretch. SHERRYS RIDGE lugged in at
the start, then settled along the inside and was no factor.
