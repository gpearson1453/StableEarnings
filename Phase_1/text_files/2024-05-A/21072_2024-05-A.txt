Footnotes
ICE AXE was blocked leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the far
bend still in the two path, dueled in the lane and kicked clear. ANNA AFTER MIDNITE raced in the two path early, led the field a bit rankly up the
backstretch, saved ground around the second turn and dueled in the lane but was caught late. MY TENNIS SHOES bumped with the horses to either side
leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the three path and
finished evenly. LAUREATE bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch,
continued to save ground around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. GRAY MIKE veered in at the start, raced at the back of the pack
through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two and three path and never threatened. RAISERICHIESRANSOM stumbled leaving the gate
and bumped with the horse to her outside, saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and tired
in the lane. CHERRY ORCHARD raced in the four path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch,
came around the far turn still in the four path and faded from there.

Footnotes
DIAMONDS JOY saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and dueled to the wire to just
hold the win. OFF THE LAM saved ground early, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and
gained ground late to just miss. HATTIE BLOOM raced in the two path around the first bend, chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the far bend
from the three path and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss. CROSSANNA saved ground early, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, swung
out to the six path coming around the second bend, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. ELODINE hopped up leaving the gate,
raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the five path and improved position in the lane.
REALISTIC GOAL raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, navigated the far turn
from the four path and finished evenly. I DID THE MATH raced in the middle of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came
around the far turn still in the two path and showed no kick. PACIFIC VIEW raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the pace setter on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and weakened in the stretch. VOSTRA raced in the four path around the first bend, settled off
the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the four path and made no bid. MISS MADALINE raced in the four
path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, saved ground around the far bend and was empty from there. ABSOLUTE
MIRACLE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and
faded in the lane. COLLIE WRAYS KITTY raced at the back of the pack in the four path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two
path and was never a factor.
