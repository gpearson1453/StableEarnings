Footnotes
PURE FORCE prompted the pace to the outside of EVAN ON EARTH into the turn, came to level terms midway through the turn, took over nearing the
furlong marker and drew clear. TOP GUN ROCKET settled off of the inside, advanced between foes on the turn, split horses inside the furlong marker and
kicked on willingly. CULPRIT was away alertly, angled in leaving the chute bumping HOUSE UNITED on the crossover, tracked three deep, came four wide
and loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened in the final yards. LOU'S LEGACY was put in tight leaving the chute, was bumped and steadied
losing position, leveled into stride readily, came under a ride leaving the turn, angled out and was making up ground. HOUSE UNITED was bumped and
checked when CULPRIT came in leaving the chute, settled at the tail of the field, mounted a belated improvement but lost his best chance early. EVAN ON
EARTH set the pressured pace along the inside, was headed nearing the furlong marker and gave way. MANFREDI saved ground to little avail. TITLE
CONTENDER was hustled along five wide through the turn and dropped out.

into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. VICTORIOUS brushed the gate at the start, tracked the pace early on, raced in the two path along the
turn, was in the three path entering the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. ZAWISH raced back early on, raced along the rail through the turn while

Footnotes
MINDFRAME showed the way uncontested in the two path around the first turn, remained in a leisurely gallop as an outer rival applied pressure around the
far turn, kicked away from that one when let out entering upper stretch, widened under vigorous hand urging through midstretch and was geared down in the
final sixteenth. CORNISHMAN broke well following a mild tussle with the assistant starter just before the gates sprung, brushed an inner foe soon at the
start, tracked along the inside came under coaxing in pursuit around the far turn, then stayed on to edge place from an outer rival late while not threatening
the leader. HIGGINS BOAT bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked outside of the leader, applied pressure around the far turn, but proved no match for
that one in upper stretch and lost place to an inner bidder late. ANTHEM KING was bumped by an outer rival and took back at the start, trailed in the four
path, then two wide around the far turn and ran on willingly. CARTUCHO took light contact from an outer rival before checking back inside of foes early on,
raced off of the pace along the inside, then three path around the far turn before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, then improved mildly late.
ELEPHANTS EAR laid off of the pace two wide, took closer order to chase forwardly between horses around the far turn, shifted to the four path in upper
stretch and yielded between horses. MENA tracked in the four to three path, then got floated to the six path while tiring entering upper stretch.
INVIGORATED stuttered a step leaving the gates, lacked speed in the three path, failed to respond to urging along the inside around the far turn and never
got involved.

Footnotes
STRONG QUALITY set the pressured pace along the inside, opened clear after a half, widened on the turn, dug in to meet the challenge of KUPUNA inside
the sixteenth marker and held stubbornly. KUPUNA settled between rivals, worked into striking distance through the turn, angled out entering the stretch to
continue the advance, kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap. FIVE STAR GENERAL was away in good order, prompted the pace to the outside of
STRONG QUALITLY to the stretch, weakened slightly during the drive but stayed on to preserve the show spot. DENINGTON lagged far back, came under
a ride with three furlongs to run, got through entering the stretch, swung to the far outside, finished well but was left with too much to do. BEST ACTOR was
unhurried between horses, came under a ride on the turn, came four wide and finished with a mild improvement. OSCAR ECLIPSE was forwardly placed
four wide through the turn and flattened. COLLABORATE settled saving ground, shifted out entering the lane and finished with a belated improvement. U. S.
ARMY contended five wide for a half and dropped out. NOT NORMAL attended the pace towards the inside through the turn and retreated. STRAVA was
allowed to settle, looped into the stretch six wide but lacked a response.

Footnotes
COGBURN prompted three deep, forged an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) bumped an outer rival at the start,
tracked along the inside around the turn, offered a rail charge to edge place from an outer foe at the sixteenth pole and held place late. MISCHIEF MAGIC
(IRE) broke a beat slow and was bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed two wide before tucking to the inside into the turn, rallied in upper
stretch before tipping three wide at the furlong grounds, then sustained progress to reach show late. COPPOLA broke out and brushed a rival at the start,
led inside of a pair of prompters into the turn, got headed by his widest counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, gave way and lost show in the closing
stages. MO STASH prompted two wide and between horses, but yielded in upper stretch and gave way hanging on his left lead. EAMONN pursued from
midpack four deep, tucked three wide putting an inner rival to tight quarters into the turn, spun to the six path into upper stretch and stayed on mildly.
MOTORIOUS (GB) was brushed by an inner rival into crowded quarters and steadied at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between horses,
checked in tight quarters among foes into the turn, shfited from the four path to the seven path at the three sixteenths pole and failed to threaten. FRONT
RUN THE FED saved ground at the rear and moved up. MISTER MMMMM brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked behind the leading trio and from
the three path, chased them in the four path in upper stretch but yielded between horses. BIG INVASION brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced off of
the pace in the four path, swung out to the nine path in upper stretch and failed to factor. BAD BEAT BRIAN pursued from midpack three wide and between
horses, steadied when pinched back entering the turn, shifted to the six path into upper stretch and made little impact. AXTHELM broke a step slow, raced
at the rear two wide and got outrun. ARREST ME RED lacked speed hung in the five to eight path and never got involved. CANDY MAN ROCKET chased
from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CHILI FLAG (FR) settled well back along the inside, then two wide around the far turn before swinging six wide entering the lane, rallied widest to bid
outside of a pair of inner stable-mates leaving the furlong grounds, wrestled a narrow advantage approaching the final sixteenth, sparred with COPPICE
(IRE) through the late stages and held. COPPICE (GB) was away awkwardly and slow to stride, laid far back two wide before saving ground around the far
turn, awaited racing room behind rivals nearing the lane, found clear sailing and rally to bid two wide and inside of a pair of stable-mates leaving the furlong
grounds, battled with a single outer counterpart through the closing stages but was denied. DELAHAYE bobbled slightly leaving the gates, saved ground off
of the pace, shifted to the four path entering upper stretch, rallied to bid along with rivals on both sides exiting midstretch, but was bested by those
stable-mates and settled for show. MISSION OF JOY rated two wide, pursued in the three to four path around the far turn before fanning five wide entering
the lane, but was outkicked between horses while flopping back to her left lead at the furlong grounds and chased the leading trio home. WALKATHON
stalked the clear leader from the two path, vied outside of that one around the far turn, led entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, but was caught by
a trio of bidders leaving the furlong grounds and faltered. ASCENDANCY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, chased turning for
home, tipped to the three path in upper stretch and yielded. CAIRO CONSORT was bumped between horses before being squeezed back soon after the
start, trailed along the inside, then moved up between horses in midstretch. EVVIE JETS tracked from midpack two wide, took the far turn in the two to three
path, got outmoved while put to tight quarters between horses entering the lane and faded. AG BULLET set a clear pace along the inside early on, got
headed by an outer bidder entering the lane and stopped. NOT SO CLOSE stuttered a step at the start, stalked three wide, chased two wide around the far
turn and weakened between horses entering the lane.

SEIZE THE GREY vied between rivals early, settled off of the pace on the backstretch, bid between horses leaving the turn, exchanged bumps with WHO
DEY near the three-sixteenths pole, tacked inward to find room, split rivals, reeled in VLANOS inside the furlong marker and gamely edged clear. NASH
tracked five wide, moved up to engage the leader leaving the turn, loomed large entering the stretch, kept on well but was unable to resist the winner.
VLAHOS disputed the pace three wide, forged a clear lead and angled in leaving the turn, fought on gamely but grudgingly gave way in the final yards.
WHO DEY settled between horses, took closer order through the turn, tipped out five wide, swapped bumps with SEIZE THE GREY with three-sixteenths to
run, shifted out to be clear, continued on willingly but wasn't quite good enough. TOP CONOR broke out and soundly bumped FROSTY INDULGENCE at
the start, was hustled along five wide, ranged into striking distance leaving the turn, was bumped again when WHO DEY came out near the three-sixteenths
pole, churned on but failed to make headway. CARBONE was hustled along in mid pack, angled out entering the stretch, kept on fairly well but failed to
threaten. BEELINE was forwardly placed along the inside, tipped out entering the stretch, but went evenly between horses. GUANARE was unhurried,
settled saving ground, angled out and advanced between horses. NORTHERN FLAME was unhurried, wheeled out eight wide into the stretch, but passed
only the tiring ones. OTTO THE CONQUEROR prompted the pace along the inside to the stretch and tired. GETTYSBURG ADDRESS was allowed to
settle, circled eight wide into the stretch but was never a factor. FROSTY INDULGENCE was bumped hard at the start and never recovered.

PROGRAM TRADING (GB) bobbled and brushed an inner rival while breaking on towards the front, stalked along the inside while pocketed around both
turns, took aim two wide and between horses while brushing an inner rival in upper stretch, bid inside of the new leader passing the furlong grounds, took a
brush from that one passing the sixteenth pole, dueled through the late stages and narrowly prevailed. NAVAL POWER (GB) stalked two wide, bid along
with an outer rival entering the lane, led narrowly in upper stretch, repelled his outer counterpart's bid while meeting an inner challenge at the furlong
grounds, flopped back to his left lead shortly after, brushed that foe before changing back to his right lead in the final sixteenth, sparred gamely to the wire
but was narrowly bested. WEBSLINGER brushed the outer stall door upon leaving the gate and was off a step slow, trailed in the two path, shifted to the
four path at the five furlong pole, offered a four wide blitz around the far turn to sweep past foes turning for home and offer a bid for the lead outside of the
top pair entering the lane, vied through upper stretch, but flattened out while getting turned away leaving the furlong ground, yielded to the top pair before
meeting an inner challenge for show in the final sixteenth, and saved that position via a head-bob. INTEGRATION pursued from midpack along the inside,
shifted to the two to three path while rallying in midstretch, sustained his progress to bid for show inside of WEBSLINGER in the final sixteenth, but narrowly
missed. FAR BRIDGE broke a beat slow and took light contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, entered the lane in the five
path before tipping wider in upper stretch, then ran on mildly while hanging on his left lead. SIEGE OF BOSTON was a bit reluctant to be the final contender
to load, lacked speed three wide, took the far turn in the three to four path and between horses, took a brush from his outer rival entering the lane, then
lacked a bid between horses. I'M VERY BUSY was a bit fractious in the starting gate necessitating backing out for a brief veterinarian exam pre-race, lacked
speed along the inside, took the far turn in the four to five path, brushed an inner rival entering the lane, then lacked a rally and yielded between horses.
ANGLOPHILE pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, chased in the three path in upper stretch and faded. NEVER SURPRISED established
a clear advantage early on, enjoyed a loose lead down the backstretch, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders at the head of the lane, took light contact
from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole and caved. CELLIST was put to tight quarters early on and checked back with seven and a half furlongs to
go, tracked three wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

MYSTIK DAN tracked the leaders in rail skimming fashion, slipped through to make a bold bid nearing the quarter pole, came to level terms entering the
stretch, shook clear approaching the furlong marker, dug in doggedly and was fully extended to prevail by the slimmest of margins. SIERRA LEONE settled
in hand, tucked in along the rail, shifted out a bit on the backstretch, took closer order between rivals through the second turn, worked his way out eight wide
entering the stretch, exchanged bumps with FOREVER YOUNG (JPN) from the three-sixteenths pole to the furlong grounds, fought on tenaciously under
stern left handed urging but was denied. FOREVER YOUNG (JPN) lunged at the start and was away slow, was caught in traffic into the first turn and
steadied near the fifteen-sixteenths pole, leveled into stride and moved out five wide, mounted a long drive a half mile out, moved up swiftly through the
second turn, came seven wide into the stretch, swapped bumps repeatedly with SIERRA LEONE through the upper stretch, battled on stubbornly between
rivals thereafter but was narrowly bested. CATCHING FREEDOM settled off of the inside, tucked in on the second turn, followed the winner into the lane
along the inside, continued on well and was making up ground. T O PASSWORD (JPN) broke a step slow, checked in traffic into the first turn, settled off the
inside into the backstretch, came under a ride nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, looped seven wide through the second turn and into the stretch, had the
jockey lose the crop near the furlong marker and continued on well under a fierce hand ride. RESILIENCE settled in pursuit from midpack three wide,
ranged up with a bold six wide gain turning for home to bid along with inner rivals entering the lane but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart in
upper stretch, got outkicked for place between rivals in midstretch and yielded. STRONGHOLD stalked behind the leaders and from the three path around
the first turn, came under rousing within striking range in the four path turning for home, bid along with rivals on both sides entering the lane, but failed to
keep pace with his inner counterpart while getting brushed and floated inwardly by an outer rival in upper stretch and gave way. HONOR MARIE was jostled
hard early between rivals, settled toward the inside, was caught in traffic and steadied into the first turn, leveled into stride while saving ground, moved up on
the second turn, veered out sharply inside the three-sixteenths and boxed on willingly. ENDLESSLY leaned outwardly at the start, was allowed to settle at
the rear along the inside, improved in the three to four path and between horses around the far turn before swinging ten wide into the lane, then moved up
willingly without reaching contention. DORNOCH settled saving ground, was shuffled back in traffic inside the half mile marker, came again between foes,
was bumped and checked hard off heels near the quarter pole, angled out into the stretch but came up empty in the drive. TRACK PHANTOM showed the
way inside of a pair of prompting foes, remained hounded inside of rivals one path off the rail around the far turn but was headed by challengers on either
side entering the lane and folded. WEST SARATOGA raced forwardly two wide and between horses, chased from the two to three path around the far turn,
was bumped and jostled by an inner rival to the four to five path entering the lane, was brushed again by an inner foe in upper stretch and gave way.
DOMESTIC PRODUCT broke a step slow before being bumped and pinched between horses at the start, tugged while off of the pace four wide into the first
turn, got brushed and put into tight quarters between foes while getting outmoved by a wider rival around the far turn, shifted to the nine path into the lane
and passed tired ones. EPIC RIDE stalked outside of the leading trio, came under a drive in the five path and between horses around the far turn but
retreated entering the lane then shied from an inner foe and brushed an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole and faded. FIERCENESS hopped at the
start, prompted the pace three deep, vied in the four path around the far turn, but was surpassed by an outer pair and an inner bidder entering the lane and
folded between horses. SOCIETY MAN raced off of the pace four wide, then faded between horses around the far turn. JUST STEEL was bumped hard
early, was quickly into stride and contested the pace between horses, faltered midway through the second turn and faded. GRAND MO THE FIRST brushed
an inner rival at the start, steadied among foes passing the wire for the first time, laid well back in the three path, came under urging in the four path
approaching the five furlong pole then gave way in the six path around the far turn. CATALYTIC contended along the inside to the second turn and dropped
out. JUST A TOUCH was bumped early, settled between horses, moved into contention on the second turn, was bumped in traffic near the five-sixteenths
pole and came up empty thereafter.
