ELLIE VICTORINA chased the pace outside LUNITA, challenged that one in mid stretch and drove clear late. LUNITA sprinted to the early lead, moved to
the inner rail leaving the backstretch, set the pace to mid stretch and weakened in the drive. FAINOR'S FILETS , in hand along the rail behind LUNITA
leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail n the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. A GIRL NAMED JAC hesitated
when acting up at the start, advanced three deep on the turn, weakened and remained on her left lead in the stretch. There was a stewards' inquiry
concerning the start but no action was taken.

COMMANDING GENERAL was acting up a bit as the gates sprung and was away last, regrouped and stalked four wide, came under a ride leaving the five
sixteenths, closed in under left handed encouragement and engaged the leader nearing mid stretch, wrested command soon after, spurted clear then held
firm while geared down late. GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) prompted the pace two to three wide, shifted in with aim near the eighth pole then continued with good
energy while second best. PSYCHEDELIC SHACK took over at once, set the pace towards the inside and under some rating, maintained command under
coaxing while two wide into the lane, failed to contain the winner leaving the furlong grounds and weakened late. SMITTEN ENOUGH , three wide between
runners forcing the early pace, dropped in towards the rail mid turn, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faded.

RAD PAISLEY bobbled slightly at the break, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail on the turn and steadily pulled away through the stretch under
brisk urging. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , three wide chasing the winner around the turn, rallied mildly. CAPTAIN CARDO raced in the two path between horses
around the turn, remained between rivals through the stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and closed. MORNING THOUGHTS lacked speed, stayed
in the three path around the turn, floated out in upper stretch and failed to rally between horses. ARISTOCRATIC chased the winner around the turn and
weakened in the stretch drive. AEQUOR trailed for a half mile, left the turn five deep, drifted wider and lacked a serious rally. SMOOTH RICO , off a step
slow, rushed up inside horses down the backstretch remained in contention to the stretch and gave way.

GREAT DAYS AHEAD , sluggish from the gate, lagged off the rail into the turn, responded leaving the three eighths and quickly gained three to four wide to
have aim into the stretch, took over from TOP BOSS with a furlong to go and drew clear under a drive. TOP BOSS cleared without much asking, set the
pace two wide into the lane, dug in when confronted soon after, battled inside the winner heading to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly.
GABRIEL'S WING stalked outside a rival, was under a ride three wide into the lane and kept on with effort to the wire. PUTIN ONLINE bobbled at the break,
recovered and raced off the pace while saving ground, swung out in upper stretch but came up empty. ISLAND D'LITE prompted the pace while saving
ground, failed to kick on when asked in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
GRAND OPENING broke alertly to make the early lead, saved ground around the turn, responded to the whip in mid stretch, pulled away and was allowed
to coast home late. HUB prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch, gave way and switched to his left lead approaching the sixteenth pole. BLUE
KINGDOM , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, began to get out leaving the turn, drifted to the five path in upper stretch and gave way.
HAIZUM , three deep on the turn, lacked a rally. STREET SWAGGER bumped with DATS MY PHARAOH at the start, raced in the two path around the turn
and was not a factor. CHACHACHING raced along the inner rail on the turn and weakened. DATS MY PHARAOH bumped with STREET SWAGGER at the
start, trailed and was eased.

Footnotes
UPSWELL stumbled outward at the break then stumbled soon after, regrouped and settled off of a contested pace while three wide, gathered momentum
past the three eighths, angled five wide into the lane, responded when put to firm asks, closed rapidly outside foes, took command inside the sixteenth pole
and drew clear. HATEFUL moved up to engage the leader near the half then dueled two wide between foes, shook clear under a drive nearing mid stretch,
kept on to about the sixteenth marker, failed to contain the winner's charge but continued with good effort to be well clear of the rest.
SWEETERTHANWHISKEY , four deep when moving to contention, exchanged a bump with LITTLE JOSIE WALES near the half, dropped in a path and
sparred three deep around the turn, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded late. POLICE WOMAN settled off the pace, raced about three wide in
upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. BLUE TRILLION broke outward, corrected and cleared early towards the inside, was joined by outer rivals nearing the
half mile pole, dueled, was in a bit close entering the lane, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and weakened. DETERMINED BLUE saved ground
and came up empty. LITTLE JOSIE WALES rushed up between rivals soon after the break, vied three wide between horses then bumped with an outer foe
nearing the turn, steadied when shuffled back near the three eighths, regroup to pursue three to four wide and faded.

Footnotes
MOSLER TIME saved ground the first turn, rated behind horses down the backstretch, bumped with ENERGY EFFICIENT when taken outside the leaders
approaching the far turn, gained a three wide lead mid way on the turn, drifted out some in the drive and held sway under energetic urging. JARDANI lacked
speed, circled the far turn three wide, angled to the inner rail in upper stretch and rallied. ENERGY EFFICIENT , caught in tight quarters approaching the
first turn, raced outside rivals down the backstretch, bumped and was forced four wide leaving the backstretch, chased the winner and weakened.
TEMPESTIVO , never a factor, was steadied in tight quarters near the three eighths pole. RUNNING RIVER disputed the pace outside BLAME THE TUX
and gave way on the far turn. BLAME THE TUX dueled near the inner rail and gave way on the far turn. WE DONT NEED ROADS weakened along the
inner rail and was eased in the stretch run.

Footnotes
I CAN DO IT settled in the clear and off of a contested pace, moved up four wide into the lane, angled out, leveled off under pressure, bid outside foes to
take over inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear. WHATSYOURBIGIDEA rated close up, edged up three wide into the lane, shifted out, closed between
runners to gain a slim lead a sixteenth out, could not quite match strides with the winner leaving the sixteenth pole but continued on well to the wire.
GOLDRUSH HOTTIE grabbed command early, set the pace towards the inner rail, dueled from the five sixteenths to about mid stretch then faded late.
VISBY tracked outside, moved to apply more pressure mid turn, dueled and gained a short lead in upper stretch, could not contain outer rivals leaving the
sixteenth pole and weakened. NAVANI broke poorly, raced off the pace and off the inside, swung out in the lane and had belated interest. TINA TINA TINA
failed to menace. LANETTA saved ground stalking the pace, gave way in upper stretch and was being eased late.
