Footnotes
JUBASLILBALLERINA took a quick lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, widened a bit
at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. CHANGE THE WORLD stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dueled through the stretch for second. HESSICA raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. JUBA'S PARADE was unprepared for the
start and broke in the air, closed to contention in the four path on the opening turn and picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path then flattened in the stretch. LUCKY BLONDE settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then
weakened on the far turn. THE SKY IS FALLING rounded the opening turn about the three path, left the turn outside and showed little response. NO
DENYING DENIS saved ground.

Footnotes
STROLLINGINTHEWIND was bumped leaving the gate then stalked off the rail the first turn, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took
the lead approaching the quarter, raced clear midway on the far turn and held well under steady stretch handling. PINNACLE REEF rated a slim lead inside,
was pressured by Twilight Years leaving the half mile pole and kept the advantage over that one through the backstretch, but was met toward the quarter
pole, remained a factor near the rail on the turn but ultimately, had to settle for second. NEVERFOLD settled in the four path the opening turn, left the turn
outside and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third the final strides. TWILIGHT
YEARS stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the half mile pole but dropped back toward the quarter and flattened in the three path on the far turn.
OCEAN STORM bobbled outward and made contact with Strollinginthewind leaving the gate then closed toward contention and stalked from the four path
the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three and four paths on the far turn and flattened in the lane. MEETMARYSMAN saved
ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and showed little in the lane. DOCTOR PARDO rounded the first turn in the five path,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path on the far turn. JACKSON MAN was not a factor.

HAPPY CHAMP settled in the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved four wide on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and
got up the final yards. MASAI MAN stalked two deep then challenged at the three eighths pole, took the nod approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear
nearing the head of the lane and dug in leaving the far turn, but was caught while flattening stride the final yards. CAPE LOOKOUT saved ground well back
from early contention, started his bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out entering the stretch and finished well to
clear third the final yards. ROYAL THUNDER rated the pace inside, was met and dueled leaving the three eighths pole, remained close at the rail on the far
turn but dropped back approaching the head of the lane and flattened mid-stretch. SETTLEMENT DATE raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened mid-stretch. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA saved ground, picked up the chase from the
three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. FEARNOUGHT rounded the first turn about the four path and showed little response through
the backstretch. MISTER WINSTON rounded the opening turn about the three path then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
LITTLE BABY GIRL saved ground just off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took over three wide approaching the head of the lane,
raced clear past the eighth pole and held well with steady handling. AVALANCHE IS COMIN was reluctant to load and settled back about the three path the
first turn, started her bid leaving the three eighths pole, closed to the heels of Wac Is Fast approaching the head of the lane, but dug in at the rail leaving the
eighth pole and finished well to take second later yards. MALTESE ROSE was bumped leaving the gate then stalked two deep, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn but was bumped at the eighth pole and flattened stride. WAC IS FAST rated the pace inside, came
under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and was met at the rail toward the head of the lane, drifted a path outward and made contact with Maltese
Rose at the eighth pole and weakened. CAST YOUR NET veered outward and made contact with Sugar Momma leaving the gate, rounded the first turn off
the rail and picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three and four paths on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn and weakened.
DEE DEE SIX stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded in the five path on the far turn. JOLENES
ECLIPTICAL was bumped outward and into Maltese Rose leaving the gate and her rider lost his irons as a result, was taken to the outside, recovered the
irons into the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. SUGAR MOMMA was bumped outward and into Jolenes Ecliptical leaving the gate and
saved ground.

to get up the final yards. MAD SWANN gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in to take second the final strides. JUBA'S PUNCH veered
outward leaving the gate then gave chase, raced at a close disadvantage in the three path on the turn, dueled to the lead nearing mid-stretch but was
caught in the final yards. CRAFTY WINDSOR CAT rated a slim lead, was pressured leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the
turn but was met nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened. WINDSOR'S MEMORY gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the

Footnotes
GOLD FIBER was bumped outward and into Missionary leaving the gate then pressured the pace, contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the turn,
dueled to the front past the eighth pole and edged clear the final yards. COLT ROCK veered out and made contact with Gold Fiber leaving the gate then
rated close through the backstretch, raced boxed at the rail on the turn, angled three wide leaving the turn and dug in to take second the final strides. PINK
DINGHY came in and had his heels clipped on the chute then gave chase, raced close three wide on the turn, drifted entering the stretch but dug in to
recover third under the wire. REMYS GUNSMOKE took a quick lead while tapering to the inside and set a pressured pace, contested the edge at the rail on
the turn, dueled at even terms through the upper stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. MISSIONARY was reluctant to load and became fractious in the
gate, was bumped outward and into LASTWALKTOFREEDOM on the chute then gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn then
flattened mid-stretch. The latter came in on the chute and was immediately bumped outward and into DE'S CASTLE, and never factored. DE'S CASTLE
was forced outward on the chute, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened in the lane. FROGGY THE
GREMLIN was shut off and clipped the heels of Pink Dinghy on the chute then moved to the outside and ran wide on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a
claim of foul against the riders of Pink Dinghy and Remys Gunsmoke for interference soon after the start, lodged by the rider of Froggy The Gremlin, but
determined the former two mentioned were not at fault.

SARGENT KOBE rated well off the pace on the opening turn, started his bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved, raced at the rail on
the far turn, angled three wide leaving the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. ROCKET APPEAL stalked two deep on the first
turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, took the nod toward the quarter pole and kept the edge two
deep on the far turn, but was met mid-stretch and relented later yards. MISSIONSNINETYNINE jumped a shadow leaving the three quarter pole then rated
a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from that point, ceded the nod toward the quarter pole,
remained a factor at the rail on the far turn but flattened stride mid-stretch. MACHEN'S RIDGE settled off the rail the first turn then eased out into the
backstretch, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, drifted leaving the turn and showed little more.
WINDSOR'S TRACKER saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane.
RUN TO DAYLIGHT steadied off the heels of Missionsninetynine leaving the three quarter pole then rated close inside, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path on the far turn. MASTER THIS showed little response. HAPPY YEARS stalked three wide on the first turn then
faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
W V LAD hesitated at the start and was shut off at the break then settled into stride, started his bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and steadily improved,
circled the field in the five path on the turn and dug in from the head of the lane to get up the final yards. BIG BOY OVI became fractious in the paddock,
veered in leaving the gate then gave chase, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, dueled clear midway on the turn and was steadily encouraged leaving
the turn, but gave up the lead in the final yards. A FAIR NOTION was bumped at the break then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and came
along to take third late. SEATTLE PRINCE veered outward and made sharp contact with Cano's Baby then gave chase, checked at the rail past the five
sixteenths pole and showed little in the lane. TUP'S TO TAKE took the lead while angling to the inside and set a pressured pace, was met nearing the
quarter pole, dropped back midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. SAN SEBASTIAN was bumped then pinched back at the start, gave chase
outside, rounded the turn about the six path and passed some rivals in the lane. CANO'S BABY was bumped soundly then pinched back at the break, gave
chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and weakened in the lane. MAJESTY'S COWBOY stumbled then checked
sharply leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and weakened. DEVILS WAR CRY chased toward the
inside then gave way at the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Seattle Prince for interference leaving the gate,
lodged by the riders of both, Cano's Baby and San Sebastian, and as a result, Seattle Prince was disqualified to seventh place.
