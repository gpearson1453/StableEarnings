Footnotes
IMA KEEN ICE was crowded a bit at the start and broke a half-step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages and saved ground into the first turn,
improved position into the backstretch run and was well placed while saving ground nearing the half-mile marker, continued to advance into the far turn, was
roused at the quarter marker, split rivals and mounted a two wide bid into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, responded past mid-stretch and took
command into the final sixteenth, was kept to task in deep stretch and drove clear at the finish. HANG ON prominent away from the start, assumed
command into the first turn, ceded the lead to PEGGY THE COLONEL heading into the backstretch run and stalked that rival through decent fractions
nearing the half-mile, was roused two to three wide into the far turn, vied for the lead at the quarter then took command into the stretch, drew to a clear lead
at the furlong marker, was overtaken by IMA KEEN ICE into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and was second best.
MISS PERU allowed to settle while never far back in the early going, was guided two to three wide into the far turn and trailed approaching the quarter
marker, could not impact the top pair in the stretch drive and ran on in the late stages to be clear for third. LADY PROUD broke alertly, took back off of the
early pace and tracked three wide into the first turn, well placed through the backstretch run, mounted a three to four wide bid nearing the quarter marker,
ran evenly while within aim into the stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. PEGGY THE COLONEL raced close up to the early
pace, made a two wide move along the first turn and assumed command into the backstretch run, drew to a clear lead nearing the half-mile marker and set
decent fractions into the far turn, came under pressure at the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, could not
muster a response into the final sixteenth and tired.

Footnotes
BROTHER O' BRIEN took up slightly before the first turn, came off the rail to race three wide down the backstretch, sat behind the pace but never far away,
launched a bid from the nine-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch with only REEF CITY to beat but was lugging in, battled that one the length of the
stretch, took a hard bump inside the furlong pole but kept to task and pulled away slightly close to the wire. REEF CITY hustled from the break and gradually
worked over to join MOTIVATING FORCE going into the first turn, went together with that one around the bend then took over the pacesetting duties and
pulled clear a bit heading down the backstretch, was pushed by CANTILEVER and MOTIVATING FORCE to quicken the pace, held both at bay to the
quarter pole then had to deal with BROTHER O'BRIEN making a move on the outside, pulled away with that one in upper stretch and dueled to the wire,
veered in and bumped just past the eighth pole, kept on gamely but was outfinished in the final yards with a large gap back to the rest. MISCHIEF'S
THIRSTY broke a beat slowly then was at the back of the pack going into the first turn, raced five wide in the clear down the backstretch, was kept to task
and outlasted the rest for third. CANTILEVER took up sharply going into the first turn, was still able to get a tracking position just behind the dueling leaders,
moved together with MOTIVATING FORCE to put pressure on REEF CITY, but neither were able to get past that one, came under a hard ride from the
quarter pole to the finish and was passed in deep stretch. CALLUM lacked any speed and was near the back of the pack early, continued to trail through the
turn, kept on grinding away and was able to pass one in the stretch. MOTIVATING FORCE broke well from the inside and was able to seize the rail position
going into the clubhouse turn, led the field through that turn then ceded the lead to REEF CITY turning on to the backstretch, tracked to the half mile pole
then went to put more more pressure on that rival with CANTILEVER also moving in tandem to the outside, came under a ride approaching the quarter pole
and stopped in the final furlong. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE BUMPING INCIDENT NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE BETWEEN #6 REEF
CITY AND #4 BROTHER O'BRIEN. THE STEWARDS RULED THAT #6 REEF CITY INITIATED THE CONTACT AND DID NOT COST #4 BROTHER
O'BRIEN A BETTER PLACING THEREFORE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH WAS WARRANTED.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET raced close up in the early stages, stalked the solid pace from the second flight approaching the turn, angled three wide at the quarter
marker and loomed into upper stretch, was roused nearing the furlong marker and took a narrow lead at mid-stretch, battled then shook free into the final
sixteenth, was kept to task into deep stretch and edged away late. MARS ON FIRE allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into turn and
advanced at the quarter pole, shifted two wide for the drive and was full of run nearing the furlong marker, split rivals past mid-stretch, was outkicked by
IMPERIAL HORNET and was second best. COWBOY KISSES broke alertly and showed good speed away from the start, engaged with COWBOY
CHARLIE in the early going and contested solid fractions with that rival heading into the turn, pressed the pace two wide nearing the quarter marker and
took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was confronted by IMPERIAL HORNET nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the top two into the final
stages and was clear in the end for third. AMANOFMYSTATURE tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, was guided two wide into the turn and
gained ground at the quarter marker, maintained that two wide path into the lane and continued his bid at mid-stretch, could not sustain his run into the final
sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. EDDIE CROSSWIRE allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the turn and trailed approaching
the quarter marker, drifted out into upper stretch and carried out CHIEF JACKSON at the three-sixteenths, angled out for the drive and offered a mild late
response. COWBOY CHARLIE hustled away from the start, engaged with COWBOY KISSES in the early going and disputed quick fractions with that rival
heading into the turn, dueled to the quarter marker while inside of COWBOY KISSES, vied for the lead into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker,
was outrun into the final sixteenth and gave way. CHIEF JACKSON lacked early speed, was guided three wide into the turn, carried out five to six wide into
upper stretch and did not factor. SENSEMAKER forwardly placed away from the start, chased the solid early pace from the second flight, was guided three
wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
CRY ME A RUNNER broke outward at the start and bothered BOURBON GLAZE, was allowed to settle into stride then pulled the rider towards the leaders,
forcing the rider to have to steady repeatedly between the half and three eighths poles, tipped out three wide, was set down at the top of the stretch, made
steady gains under strong handling and intermittent urging, took over the lead with a sixteenth to go and won clear. MAJESTIC GIG broke sharply but was
content to let the pace scenario play out in the early stages, started an extended bid from the half mile pole, went three wide through the turn, pulled nearly
even with BLURSDAY at the top of the stretch, battled that stubborn foe to deep stretch, briefly took the lead but was passed late by the winner.
BLURSDAY was hustled out of the gate, brushed with BOB'S VAI, seized the early lead with BOB'S VAI pressing the issue to the inside, put that one away
after three furlongs then immediately took on a new challenge from MAJESTIC GIG, dueled that one to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly in the final
furlong. LITTLE LILIANA broke in at the start and bothered BOURBON GLAZE, steadied, then raced near the back in the early going, moved four wide into
contention after passing the half mile, pole, bid three wide around the turn, loomed a threat passing the quarter pole, finished well but could not make an
impact. BOURBON GLAZE got squeezed at the start and had to steady, then was hard ridden to regain contact with the field, made a mild gain on the turn
but could not sustain the bid and was no factor down the stretch. BOB'S VAI broke out at the start and brushed with BLURSDAY then was pushed to get
forward position, was able to secure the rail and press BLURSDAY through solid early fractions, started to weaken approaching the three furlong pole and
was unable to keep up late.

Footnotes
GET KRAKEN allowed to settle while never far back in the early running, was guided to the two path into the first turn and was well placed into the
backstretch run, tracked the modest pace nearing the half-mile, raced between rivals into the second turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, was
caught a bit in tight nearing the top of the stretch and angled three to four wide for the drive, loomed at mid-stretch, took command into the final sixteenth
and drove clear. BRAVO RAGAZZO prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, advanced two wide into the far turn and pressed the pace nearing the quarter marker, battled into the stretch and vied for the
lead between rivals nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in deep stretch to secure the
place honors. SARK broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set the pace into the first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run,
carved out moderate fractions nearing the half-mile marker, was pressured into the second turn by BRAVO RAGAZZO and battled that rival into the stretch,
lost the lead past mid-stretch and stubbornly stayed on into the final sixteenth, yielded in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just holding for
third. FAR TO LONG was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the early pace while saving ground into the first turn, was well placed along the
backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the second turn, came in tight at the quarter marker then steadied while stuck in traffic entering the stretch,
found room nearing the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and just missed for third.
GOODBYE DAL allowed to settle in the early stages, raced four wide into the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and was well
placed while widest at the half-mile, mounted a five wide bid at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch drive and flattened out.
DUNGARVAN OAK was forwardly placed leaving the start, raced close up to the early pace and tracked three wide along the first turn, well placed through
the backstretch run, mounted a three to four wide bid approaching the quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch and weakened in the final stages. I AM
AMADEO allowed to settle in the early stages, was guided three wide along the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far
turn and did not factor in the stretch. GOLD CANDY hesitated at the start and was away slowly, lacked early speed and trailed through the backstretch run,
lost contact with the rest into the second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
KRISTIN LEE not asked for speed early, settled well behind the pace duel, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, got within striking range at the quarter
pole , swung three wide into the stretch, wore down the leaders and edged clear under intermittent urging in the final yards. ARCTIC BREEZE was allowed
to settle, tracked well behind the pace early then started to advance from the half mile pole, saved ground through the turn, was thwarted when trying to get
out a path in the stretch then altered course to the inside, finished up well under steady handling but could not catch the winner. BROADWAY TIGER was
hustled away from the gate and joined TOUR QUEEN through quick early fractions, was unable to keep pace when that foe quickened heading into the turn,
re-bid from the quarter pole, engaged in a four way battle down the stretch but was outkicked in the end. TOUR QUEEN broke well, dueled outside of
BROADWAY TIGER through the initial furlong then put some distance on the field passing the seven-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch with a short lead
but was overtaken from all sides in mid-stretch and outfinished. EMBRACEABLE YOU was last away, dropped far behind early, chased the solid pace
through the turn, swung widest for the stretch drive and gained ground at the furlong marker, needed more in the late stages and finished evenly.

SEA OF LIBERTY away from the gate in good order, raced close up to the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace through
the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn, was taken off of the rail and asked for run two to
three wide nearing the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and took command heading to the furlong pole, was set down at mid-stretch and met the
bid of WELLSWORT into the final sixteenth, dueled the game runner-up to deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. WELLSWORT (IRE)
allowed to settle away from the start, was guided two wide into the clubhouse turn and was unhurried through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far
turn and was roused at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and was full of run nearing the furlong pole, vied for the lead at
mid-stretch and battled SEA OF LIBERTY into the final sixteenth, dueled the determined winner to deep stretch, was gamely bested in the final strides and
just held for second at the finish. ORIGINAL was prominent leaving the start, rated nicely off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was
unhurried through the backstretch run and saved ground nearing the half-mile, roused two to three wide into the far turn, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and rallied at the furlong pole, responded to urging into the final sixteenth and closed fast into deep stretch, surged in the final strides and just
missed for the win and place, while holding safely in the end for the show honors. IMPLICITLY was allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into
the first turn, was reserved through the backstretch run and was guided two wide into the second turn, angled widest for the stretch drive and advanced at
the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth but could not reel in the leaders in deep stretch. J T'S WATCH was crowded a bit leaving the start
and was away from the gate a step slowly, was unhurried in the early going and saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail along the backstretch
run, saved all of the ground into the far turn and improved position at the quarter marker, rallied at mid-stretch, needed more into the final sixteenth and
found his best stride late. STRAIT OF GEORGIA hustled away from the start, vied for the early lead then ceded the front to MACHO CHROME, stalked the
decent pace into the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile marker, chased four to five wide into the second turn and advanced at
the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not muster the needed response in the final sixteenth. MACHO CHROME broke a step slowly
leaving the start, rushed up in the early going and assumed command into the first turn, set a decent early pace and carved out solid fractions approaching
the half-mile, showed the way into the second turn and held a clear lead at the quarter pole, came under pressure into upper stretch and battled to the
furlong marker, was overtaken past mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was allowed to settle, raced two to three wide
along the first turn, unhurried through the backstretch run, was guided outside of rivals and raced five wide nearing the quarter marker, offered a mild
response in the stretch drive but did not factor. ITS THIEVERY was prominent away from the start, vied for the early lead and stalked the pace into the first
turn, chased MACHO CHROME through solid fractions nearing the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit while three to four wide and between rivals nearing the
quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and tired in the final stages. LOAFERS BOY allowed to settle in the early running, went three wide into the first turn
and was unhurried through the backstretch run, lost position into the second turn and raced four wide approaching the quarter marker, could not find a
response in the stretch drive and was outrun.

Footnotes
MELANIE'S TIGER veered out at the start and forced CLEVER CLOVER into the adjacent path, then lagged well behind the field for the first quarter mile,
made a mid-race move through the far turn circling field, swung seven wide into the stretch and produced a bold rally to be up in time despite drifting out a
bit. NAFTIS got squeezed a bit at the start, recovered and tracked as the inside horse of the three chasing the pacesetter, was set down with three furlongs
to run and responded, pulling even with the leader at the top of the stretch, going clear approaching the furlong grounds then was caught and passed in the
final yards. HALO RANDO raced mid-pack four wide down the backstretch, started to advance from the half-mile pole and continued wide through the turn,
swung out to the six path for the stretch run and finished well under steady handling to gain third, well clear of the next horse. VALIANT SON raced on the
outside of a trio chasing the early leader, struggled to keep up when the pace quickened near the three furlong pole, got stuck behind horses in upper
stretch and lost momentum, got clear late but could not find the needed late response. REGAL REDWOOD raced between horses chasing the early leader,
was put into a drive from the five-sixteenths pole, came into the stretch three wide, loomed a threat but could not find the needed response and finished
evenly. CLEVER CLOVER broke out slightly but made light contact with NAFTIS, tracked from close range inside, became boxed in through the turn, had
trouble finding clear run in the stretch but was unable to quicken when needed in deep stretch. EIGHT CLAP broke in at the start and made contact with
NAFTIS, was outrun early then raced near the back of the pack down the backstretch, came under a ride before three furlongs were run, advanced into the
stretch but could not sustain that run in the late stages and did not factor. GOOD LOVIN rocketed out of the gate and went clear early, held sway to the
quarter pole, fought back briefly when beset by challengers at the quarter pole then tired in the stretch.
