ATTILA'S BOY set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely under mild urging. EL RAYADO raced close to the pace along the inside,
lacked a late response and held for placce. JMARK got away well, pressed the pace to the turn, fell back and went evenly late. EL OCHO broke out, was
never far back while racing outside and failed to threaten in an even effort. BOLD MONEY raced close to the pace between horses and gave way leaving
the turn.

WHAT A MEMORY set a pressured pace, responded when challenged and drew off. JASMINE BABY raced close to the pace, angled in on the turn to
challenge for the lead, fell back and was no match late. DOM PROUD broke out, was unhurried early, swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid
to get up near the wire for show. HEMATITE stalked the pace, dropped back into the second turn, weakened and was caught for third. SIMPERING SMILE
broke out, was never far back, lacked a stretch response and did not threaten. LUCKY AND DARING broke out and was not a factor. MARKED BY
MISCHIEF pressed the pace, challenged on the turn and stopped.

LATIGO ELLIS set a pressured pace, drew clear entering the stretch and just lasted. LAUGHING STORM rallied around the turn, closed willingly, was
gaining fast late and got up for place. STACKERS pressed the pace, fell back leaving the turn, continued willingly to the wire and narrowed the gap. AX 'S
SHORE raced close to the pace, advanced on the turn, bid and came up empty. GRIFTER improved position in an even effort. HOLLYWOOD TIZ lagged
while racing outside, failed to rally and did not threaten. ROMP N ROLL moved up to press the pace to the second turn and stopped. CHARLIE DYNASTY
was not a factor. AWESOME COMPANY raced close to the pace along the inside and stopped into the second turn.

Footnotes
LAS TRES MARIPOSAS was pushed out at the start while away alertly, set the pace, drew off into the turn for a clear lead and held safely while kept to
task. OUR ISLAND GIRL moved up off the rail, rallied on the turn, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. HEAR ME ROAR pressed the pace early,
fell back, finished evenly and held safely for show. RAGTIME RYTHM was pushed out at the start and lacked a bid in an outside trip. RAISE OUR FLAG
improved position in an even effort. SEE YOU AT THE TOP trailed and passed tiring rivals. TOTHEMOONANDBACK was never far back, raced inside,
backed up into the turn, angled out and stopped. RUN LIKE KATE veered out at the start and had brief speed only in a dull effort.
