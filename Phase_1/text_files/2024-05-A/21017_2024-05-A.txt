Footnotes
PHOEBEINWONDERLAND got bumped at the start by RICHARD AVE, then came in after the start bumping VAMONOS VAMONOS, chased just off the
inside in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive to rally inside
the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the wire. OUT ON BAIL coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away to the eighth pole and shied to the rail under a right handed crop, dug in
under threat through the final sixteenth and was caught in the final strides. SOONTOBEKING got bumped at the start by MAN FROM MALTA due to
pressure from VAMONOS VAMONOS, chased just off the inside, then got out into the turn a path three wide brushing VAMONOS VAMONOS as RICHARD
AVE tucked in front of that rival and forced that foe to check, got steadied himself to correct course and headed back to the two path under coaxing, spun
two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and rallied willingly to secure the show honors. VAMONOS VAMONOS lunged at the break coming
inwards
and
bumping
MAN
FROM
MALTA
into
SOONTOBEKING,
and
pinching
that
middle
foe
back
minorly,
then
got
bumped
by
PHOEBEINWONDERLAND, who came inwards after the start, chased three wide and was forced to check off the heels of RICHARD AVE when that foe
tucked in front just as SOONTOBEKING got out to his inside, lost three lengths of ground before recovering under coaxing, strode green and climbed facing
kickback through the latter portion of the turn and went six wide into upper stretch, then showed good courage to improve position to the finish. MAN FROM
MALTA got bumped at the start by VAMONOS VAMONOS, who broke inwards, and was pinched back lightly bumping the hind end of SOONTOBEKING,
chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. RICHARD AVE broke in at
the start bumping PHOEBEINWONDERLAND, chased four wide early and then tucked three wide directly in front of VAMONOS VAMONOS forcing that
rival to check off his heels near the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ALEAH ALEAH broke alertly then was hustled, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. DARK DEVIL moved in while coaxed along
then was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, came out into upper stretch, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong and willingly
earned the place. MR. PAPAGIORGIO was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch and improved
late to just miss the place while narrowly up for the show. BETTA GO GO GO tracked the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was
asked inside the five-sixteenths pole, spun five wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick
then just missed the trifecta. LCGOLUCKY dropped well behind while void of speed, raced inside early on the turn, floated three then five wide nearing the
three-eighths pole, dropped to the four path later on that bend, moved further in into upper stretch and trailed.

SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command
just outside the sixteenth pole, then edged away to the finish. JOEY THE FISH chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths,
went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. MERAVIGLIOSO vied from the four path with a pair of rivals in the early
stages before chasing SISTER LINDA in closest aim three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and
kept on to preserve the show honors. SISTER LINDA coaxed from the gate, vied inside a pair of rivals early on before emerging with sole command five and
a half furlongs out, continued along the inside through the turn and into upper stretch under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, dug in under a drive and was
caught a sixteenth from home, then weakened in the late stages. GRINGOTTS chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch, offered no response. JOLLY MISS JILL chased five then four wide down the backstretch until tucked to the three path
nine-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide at the head of the stretch and weakened in the drive. FREDDYMO
FACTOR vied from the three path between foes in the early stages, lost action with five and a half furlongs to go and was placed immediately to a protective
hold and guided to the outside before being well handled and pulled up just past the nine-sixteenths and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
OCEAN GATEWAY was last of the three to commence, moved up to get the lead inside the seven-eighths pole, shook clear with a half-mile to run, went
around the turn in the three then four path, cruised into upper stretch in the five path then was asked a bit near the three-sixteenths, drew off under a
hand-ride into the final furlong and proved much the best while kept to the task. TOWHEAD held the lead early then lost the advantage to the winner,
prompted that foe from that point, dropped back near the half-mile pole under urging, departed the backstretch in the two path, angled four wide early on the
turn, moved to the five path later on that bend, came under the crop inside the five-sixteenths pole, dropped to the three path into upper stretch and safely
secured the place. AMANDA'S FOLLY was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped from the three path to the rail on the turn, turned
into the stretch in the two path while under the crop and came up empty.

Footnotes
FINAL DENILE got steadied at the start when FREE FOLK broke outwards bumping BOOM BOOM THUNDER directly in his path, chased along the inside
from the tail of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and darted out five to six wide into upper stretch, brushing CLANCY FANCY
straightened away, rallied to collar the leader a furlong from home, then edged away to the finish to prevail. Z DANCER hustled from the gate, showed the
way from the two path narrowly under pressure from a pair of rivals to the outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and was caught at the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the place honors. CLANCY FANCY tipped out shortly after the start and
chased five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch and was brushed by FINAL DENILE straightened
away, improved position to procure the show honors. BOOM BOOM THUNDER a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got bumped at the start by FREE
FOLK, who broke outwards and took over the lane of FINAL DENILE forcing that foe to steady off his heels while making contact with BOSUN, prompted
the leader from the outside four wide, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
BOSUN got bumped and steadied at the start by BOOM BOOM THUNDER due to pressure from FREE FOLK, chased six then five wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. FREE FOLK broke out at the start bumping BOOM BOOM THUNDER into
the path of FINAL DENILE, forcing that foe to steady and as well into BOSUN, prompted the pace three wide between foes coming under coaxing three
furlongs from home, faded and swung four to five wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
FACTUALLY CORRECT showed speed on the inside of a foe, dropped back near the five-eighths pole then switched out, chased outside from that juncture,
went around the turn in the three path, gained to make a bid in upper stretch, took the lead into the final furlong and drew clear under steady urging. LOOMS
BOLDLY was hustled to the front then moved clear with five furlongs to run, was urged while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage to the winner into the final furlong and proved no match but just held the place. LET IT RIDE chased the pace on the outside then four wide on
the turn, drifted out outside the furlong marker and just missed the place while up for the show. RUN CURTIS RUN was urged along off the pace, chased
inside on the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, remained on his inside lead while pursuing the leader along the rail in the drive, moved out late and
weakened. LIFE CHANGER angled in while urged along off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch, shied in and
out from the crop while remaining on his inside lead in the drive and improved to just miss the superfecta. EMERALD FOREST was urged along at the rear
on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch then dropped in, drifted inward in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and failed to
threaten. PAROS was urged along off the pace, raced into strong kickback late on the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, swung five wide into
the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SOHANA was bumped hard at the start, contested the pace on the outside, moved clear near the half-mile pole, extended the advantage in the two path on
the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, came under the crop inside the three-sixteenths pole and held under steady urging. TOUGH LOVE TORRES
broke out and bumped hard with a foe while last away, was urged along near the back, moved closer with five furlongs to run, chased four wide on the turn,
pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and willingly earned the place. FIVE TO TWO was urged along at the rear on the outside, went four wide on
the turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved to garner the show. THIRTEEN RED FLAGS bumped with a rival after the start, settled while climbing
some, angled from the two path to the five path on the turn and lacked the needed response. WALK WITH ME was hustled from the gate then bumped with
an opponent, contested the pace, dropped back nearing the half-mile pole, chased inside on the turn and tired. MEL'S BABY SISTER pressed the pace
between horses, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went around the turn in the three path and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked
off.

Footnotes
VIN SANTO coaxed from the gate, chased three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced through the latter
portion of the turn and took over command just outside the quarter pole, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under challenge
from flanking rivals, repelled the outside rival in the final seventy yards and gamely fended off the runner up by a bob of the head on the wire. ARCO
AUGUSTA broke out at the start bumping KID KREESA into WISECRACKER in tandem with pressure outside from the breaking inwards IRIE MAN, chased
three wide and remained patiently handled through the turn off the heels of SWEET TONE nearing the quarter pole, attempted to tip out and was forced to
steady off the heels of that rival and WISECRACKER at the quarter pole, altered in and gained brief clearance spinning three wide before SWEET TONE
cornered directly in front and was forced to steady once more just outside the three-sixteenths marker before altering to the two path, rallied to issue a
challenge a furlong from home, dug in head to head with good courage after being stopped twice and lost the nod at the finish. IRIE MAN broke in at the
start bumping WISECRACKER into KID KREESA in concert with ARCO AUGUSTA, who broke outwards from along the inside of that pair pinching them
back between, chased five wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final
eighth, dug in running on to the end but was repelled in the late stages. SWEET TONE chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung four then three wide into upper stretch forcing ARCO AUGUSTA to steady in behind just outside the three-sixteenths pole, then
weakened through to the finish. TRIPLE WORD SCORE coaxed from the gate, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. WISECRACKER got bumped between foes at the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. WO HOP chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside
route into upper stretch, tired. KID KREESA got bumped between foes at the start, established the front shortly after the break and showed the way in hand
just off the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths under pressure, yielded the front outside the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper
stretch, then faltered in the drive.
