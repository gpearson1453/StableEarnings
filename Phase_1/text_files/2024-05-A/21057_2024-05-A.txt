Footnotes
EYE ON THE CANDY quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside and held well to remain clear under strong handling. ENTRUST tracked the early
leader two deep from the outside of rival, ridden along just off the inside around the far turn, took aim near the three sixteenths pole but couldn't get by to
finish second best. MILANO settled off the early pace to race near the back of the pack, raced near the inside approaching the quarter pole angled out into
the upper stretch to race from the outside in the drive and moved up to improve position. OROCOVIX stalked the pace from the inside down the backstretch,
continued its inside run while being urged near the rail through the far turn and weakened through the drive. WONDER WATER dropped back early, saved
ground around the far turn into the lane and never threatened. HACHURE raced in tight quarters soon after the start, stalked the pace from the outside of
rivals and tired readily.

Footnotes
KAPADOKYA bore in when racing erratically soon after the break, vied for the early lead near the inside and prevailed late under all out pressure. FROSTY
MAYA chased from the inside early on, angled out through the far turn, surged between late and missed in a game effort. SUN STREAMING raced off the
early pace, swung wide into the upper stretch and closed in gamely to the wire. BUNNY HOP raced in a bit tight soon after the break, dropped back early,
raced three deep nearing the eighth pole, angled out nearing the eighth pole and finished gamely with a belated rally. Jockey of Bunny Hop claimed
objection against the winner for interference soon after the start and stewards ruled no change. KAPATUDE off slowly and forced out by SEAP soon after
the break, urged three wide through the far turn and raced even with no closing run. SEAP broke to the outside, pressed the early leader from the outside
and faded. AFTERNEATH was urged near the early on through the far turn and faded.

UNCAPTURED STORM settled off the early going, advanced through the far turn racing near the rail, tipped out four wide through the upper stretch, shifted
back in two deep late and surged up under strong handling. NAKED AND FAMOUS stalked the pace from the outside, challenged three deep near the
quarter pole, led just inside the sixteenth pole and missed in a game effort. YOU MUST CHILL rated early on under a firm hold, moved up four wide around
the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. MOSE PERFECT prompt the early leader from the outside and faded in the drive. DUST DEVIL unhurried early
on, raced two deep around the far turn, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. GROUP HUG void of early speed, raced
three deep near the quarter pole and lacked a bid while racing from the far outside in the stretch. UNCLE IRISH set a pressured early pace near the rail and
faded in the drive.

SUMMERSTATEOFMIND stalked the top dueling pair, raced three deep around the far turn, took aim five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished
strongly to edge clear under strong pressure. BOX OF ROCKETS dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and kept on gamely to the wire.
SKYLAR'S BROTHER was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, raced two to three wide through the stretch drive and moved up to
improve position. HOLONUI dueled near the rail and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. MOONFLYER dropped back early off the pace setters, raced
five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had final winning bid. GREAT GOOGLYMOOGLY hustled along, raced three wide between near the quarter
pole and had no response. VIBRANT FORCE chased the pace from the outside and tired readily in the drive.

KING'S RIVER broke in at the start, rate back early, moved up four wide through the far turn and finished well to edge up strong handling.
BANDITSGOLDENCHILD was bumped at start, raced mid pack early, moved up three wide between rivals near the quarter pole, drifted through the stretch
to race wide and kept on gamely to the wire. DIVINE CHILD dropped back off the early pace, angled out to race widest through the stretch, raced from the
outside of a drifting Banditsgoldenchild and rallied willingly to the wire. Jockey of Divine Child claimed objection against the runner up for interference
through the stretch and stewards ruled no change. RESTLESS vied for the early lead between rivals and faltered the final eighth of a mile. SISYPHUS raced
mid pack early, had an inside run around the far turn through the stretch and no final winning bid. BRUDER pressed the early pace three deep from the
outside of foes and weakened late. MEDAGOOCH raced two wide around the far turn, was four deep near the three sixteenths ole and never threatened.
BURNINGUPTHEDOUGH pressed near the rail and faded. EL DIVINO NINO was bumped soundly at the start, fanned wide into the upper stretch and

filed and Recognize Me was disqualified and placed second. GINGER GIRL tracked the early pace setter from the inside, eased out into the upper stretch to
take aim, forced out deep stretch, altered course and shifted in late in a game effort. MEMENTO MI raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the lane
and closed in mildly. PRINCESSOFTHENORTH rated back under a firm hold into the first turn, appeared to jump shadows early into the backstretch, edge
