COLLECTED SPECIAL hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, took the inside route into
upper stretch and got set down straightened away, dug in under threat from a pair of rivals, drifted out under a left handed crop herding both slightly inside
the final sixteenth and held stubbornly to the wire. STORMQUIST got brushed at the start by IN A MINUTE who broke outwards and in turn bumped his barn
mate REMEMBER THE NAME, chased three then two wide, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick while herded very
slightly late and was across the finish to share in the place and show honors while fended off by the top one. IRIDESCENT chased five then four wide down
the backstretch before tucking three then two wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive running on to the finish, got herded slightly inside the sixteenth pole, was repelled by the winner while dead heating for the place and
show honors on the line. IN A MINUTE broke out at the start bumping STORMQUIST into REMEMBER THE NAME, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. REMEMBER THE NAME got bumped between foes at the
start due to pressure mostly from IN A MINUTE, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
KHALI MAGIC went to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dictated terms in the two path on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths pole,
extended the advantage in upper stretch, was put to the crop outside the furlong marker and proved much the best under steady urging. CINDERELLA'S
CAUSE stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match
while clear for the place. RACING COLORS settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while along for
the show. SARATOGA KISSES was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn and came up empty. HARLAN'S BOND settled on
the outside, was urged four wide on the turn and failed to respond. AMITY ISLAND was urged along at the back on the outside, dropped from the three path
to the rail on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
EVERYONELOVESLINDA chased along the inside patiently handled, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, rallied to
take command a furlong out, edged away to the finish kept to task. MY FLICKER chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. I'M BUZZY saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch before continuing outwards to be seven paths off the rail a furlong from home, then
kicked on belatedly to the finish. MOSIENKO chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, stayed on one paced through to the finish. FRAU DIABLO coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front a furlong from home and weakened in the late going.
STARSHIP DEFIANT three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, weakened in
the late stages.

Footnotes
BEST BET displayed early speed, moved in while going clear, extended the advantage in the two path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole,
responded well when put to the crop in upper stretch, remained well clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. MAGIA NERA settled just off
the pace, dropped back some near the five-eighths pole, was roused leaving the backstretch, moved from three to five wide on the turn, rallied outside in the
final furlong and closed with good energy but was too late while clear for the place. PINEAPPLE MAN tracked the pace, was urged along late on the
backstretch, chased in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick while able to safely secure the show.
MO REWARDS settled off the pace, was urged four to five wide early on the turn, dropped to the three then two path late on the bend and failed to threaten.
HARVARD was well placed just off the pace, chased while dropping from the two path to the rail on the turn and tired. SKI COUNTRY was urged along
while up close on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn and came up empty. BIG SAVE settled under some restraint, was roused while saving
ground on the turn and was no factor. NINETEEN OYSTERS was hustled from the gate, moved up to race just off the pace, dropped back with five furlongs
to run, fell to the rear of the field while moving from the two path to the five path on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
COOLCALM COLLECTED coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, swung three wide into upper stretch, got
roused at the three-sixteenths and went clear under a light drive, then got geared down through the final sixteenth to the finish. RIVER TAY (IRE) got
bumped at the start by LINARITE, who broke inwards, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the place honors while never threatening the top
one. WILL BE FAMOUS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened while along for the
show honors. ROJA LIGERA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, tired. DEVILLY stumbled at
the start and conceded a length or two to the front before settling under brief coaxing, chased two to three wide coming under urging at the
seven-sixteenths, briefly tucked to the rail midway before tipping back two to three wide into upper stretch and tired in the drive. LINARITE broke in at the
start bumping RIVER TAY, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no
impact. MAGGIE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
BIG NIGHT OUT disputed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, moved clear under urging outside the quarter-pole, spun five wide into
upper stretch, drew off into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. GUILE settled off the pace,
was urged three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and improved to just get the place. DANGEROUS DRIVER disputed the pace
down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe in the two path while asked on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and weakened then lost the place
while clear for the show. CONNIVING contested the early pace, was eased back outside the five-eighths then tracked the leading duo from the outside,
chased in the four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. DON VINO VICI was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn,
came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PUJOL angled in outside the three-quarter pole, settled under some urging, went around
the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out and failed to rally. NOBLE ONE brushed the outside of the gate then
was grabbed with a tug of the left-rein and was last away, moved in while urged along, dropped from the four path to the two path on the turn and was no
factor. PICCATA PRINCE showed early speed, moved in near the eleven-sixteenths pole, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, spun
off the rail into the stretch and had nothing left. BE THERE settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, moved from four to six wide
on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

leader through the final furlong fighting on gamely but ultimately missed at the end. ON THE HILL bobbled at the break, chased six then five wide coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick and just latched on the top pair as they hit the finish.

in under threat from a pair of rivals and was collared a sixteenth from home, then got shaken off in the late stages. ROCK THE WEEKEND a bit fractious in

swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong, closed with a rush to get the lead at the sixteenth-pole, battled with the runner-up to the
finish and prevailed under strong handling. KAIRYU (IRE) bumped with rivals at the start, moved up under urging then was taken in hand behind a foe near
the five-eighths pole, raced inside early on the turn, paused behind AMIDST WAVES when that foe took an awkward step near the three-eighths pole then
moved to the two path, waited while lacking room behind horses from the quarter-pole into upper stretch, altered out then was roused while finding room
inside the three-sixteenths, rallied between horses into the final furlong, closed well to make a bid into the final sixteenth but missed while able to get the
place. AMIDST WAVES moved in while well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, took an awkward step near the three-eighths pole and
paused, was roused once straightened for the drive, rallied to make a bid outside the furlong marker, dueled with a rival into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished while able to get the show. INDEPENDENCEAVENUE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, took the lead in upper
stretch, dueled with a foe into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked then just missed the show. KODIAC WINTERGREEN (IRE) made light contact with a
foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. MARCO T.
broke a bit awkwardly, angled in while urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor.

needed response. CARESS was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn and weakened. ARTEMIS SOUND was
urged along near the back on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TIGER BELLE (IRE) was
