broke sharp from the gates, dueling for the lead through the turn and held on for show. SWAYING LASSIE got away alertly, dueling for the lead along the
rail, but gave way in late stretch. NOLA BELLE showed no early speed racing along the inside and had no late run. CASH UP was mid pack early on, racing
three wide, then dropped to the inside through the turn and flattened out. Following the running of the race, the jockey of SWAYING LASSIE, claimed foul
against the jockey of FAUZETA'S FLAME. The claim was disallowed.

GOLDEN MERGER got off slow from the gate, saving ground, and making a steady gain along the inside to get up for a driving finish in the late stretch.
COLOR ME GONE pressed the pace early, racing from the two path, made the lead in the turn, but was outfinished late, just missing. RIG RIDER trailed the
field early, clocking the leaders, then swung outside in the second turn and closed to get up for third. BLACK EYED BANDIT stalked the pace, three wide
early, but only offered an even effort down the lane. RYDERS UP made the lead early, but faded in the second turn. BOOMER WHO was mid pack early on
and dropped back down the backstretch.

grabbing third. MIZZEN MILLIONS dueled for the lead early on, racing along the inside and flattened out in the stretch drive. HALEY WHO was mid pack

JAKE ON DAKAN broke sharp from the gates, then pressed the pace down the backstretch, making his bid after straitening up down the lane, and drawing
clear for the win. HERE COMES BRAYLON showed no speed early on and racing five to six wide throughout, then closing willingly to get up for second.
ANGEL'S SHADOWS was mid field early along the inside, then angled out on the turn and rallied to get up for show. OWEN'S CANDY BOY got hustled to
the lead out of the gate early, racing along the inside but faltered in late stretch. MO MAMBO was mid field racing in the three path and offered a mild bid
down the lane. MAFIA was near the back early on, racing five wide and offered a mild rally from mid track to no avail. THUSLY INSPIRED broke well, but
dropped back steadily thereafter with no late run. ALWAYS FIRING was near the front racing on the rail, made a mild bid at the three eighths pole but gave
way in late stretch. MYTEBQUIK chased the leaders from between horses but faded in the turn. HAZHONI trailed the field racing wide throughout and was
no factor.

BLUEGRASS RYDER chased the pace early on, then angled out at the half, steadily gaining on the leaders and closing with a rush to win easily down the
lane. FINALLY AN EDDIE dueled for the lead early, racing in the three path but was no match for the winner and held on to place. LET EM RIP dueled for
the lead, two wide but gave way at the three sixteenths pole to hold on for show. JR'S CONFIDENCE trailed the field early on, then offered a mild bid in late
stretch, but too little to late. READY TO STORM pressed the pace from the inside early on, but never fired in the stretch drive. LIGHTED VESSEL was near
the leaders into the first turn, but faded steadily at the half. DECORATION DAY refused to race and did not leave the gate, therefore, did not finish and was
walked off.
