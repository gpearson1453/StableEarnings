Footnotes
DREWY broke alertly, ceded the lead leaving the start and stalked the decent early pace outside of the leading pair, loomed three wide nearing the quarter
marker, chased the stubborn LUNA LINDA into the stretch, wore that one down in the final sixteenth and lasted for the win over the oncoming runner-up.
SIGNORA VITTORIA took back off of the decent early pace, improved position three to four wide along the turn, responded to urging past mid-stretch and
rallied into the final sixteenth, pressured DREWY in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and was up in time to secure second. LUNA
LINDA showed good speed away from the start and contested the decent early pace, dueled MAGGIE'S FAYE into the turn then took command at the
quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and was set down while traveling on the left lead, fought on stubbornly into the final sixteenth, gave way
grudgingly in deep stretch and was a clear third. CARLSBADGAL tracked the decent early pace from between rivals, chased two wide into the turn, angled
three wide nearing the quarter marker and was well placed nearing the top of the lane, was outrun while a bit green in the stretch and could not muster a
late response. TOM'S TREASURE raced close up to the decent early pace, got caught in tight while a bit rank nearing the half-mile marker and was shuffled
back at that station, dropped back and chased from the inside along the turn, raced in tight while caught in traffic nearing the top of the lane, found room at
mid-stretch but could not summon a late rally. CONNECT THE DROPS allowed to settle away from the start while not far back, raced four to five wide into
the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and did not factor. MAGGIE'S FAYE hard sent away from the
start, rushed up and contested the decent early pace with LUNA LINDA, dueled inside of that rival entering the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker,
could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BLAZE OF DREAMS broke well and raced three wide with the leaders to the turn, went to challenge for the lead near the quarter pole, pushed ahead
passing the three sixteenths pole and won clear under steady handling. MY BUCKET LIST broke well but was caught four wide down the backstretch, raced
up close for the initial furlong then was taken in hand and dropped off the pace before the half mile marker, re-bid from the five-sixteenths marker and rallied
well down the stretch to gain the place. ARTEMUS GORDON was hustled away from the gate to get forward position, pressed HAVAKASH READY through
solid early fractions, got the best of that rival in upper stretch, finished willingly but could not match the top two in the final furlong. HAVAKASH READY was
hard to load, broke best and went to the front, was pressed from the inside by ARTEMUS GORDON, held that foe at bay to upper stretch, then weakened a
bit, gave way and finished evenly.

Footnotes
WE CAN allowed to settle in the early stages, was guided two wide along the first turn, tracked the decent pace while never far back through the backstretch
run, saved ground into the second turn and loomed nearing the quarter marker, made a quick move to take command in upper stretch, kicked clear at the
furlong marker, kept to task into the final sixteenth and pulled away in the late stages for a convincing win. SMOOTH SALUTE allowed to settle away from
the start, raced three then two wide and between rivals into the first turn, reserved through the backstretch run, saved ground into the far turn and made a
mild gain at the quarter marker, mounted an inside bid into the stretch, could not make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and ran on in deep
stretch to secure place honors. ACCLIDER unhurried leaving the start, got caught four wide into the first turn, settled three wide into the backstretch run and
was content to trail nearing the half-mile marker, roused five wide into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final sixteenth and held for third at
the finish. DEO prominent leaving the chute, tracked the decent early pace from the inside, was well placed nearing the second turn and chased OH GREAT
three wide approaching the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. OH GREAT (IRE) broke alertly, assumed
command leaving the chute and drew to a clear lead heading into the first turn, made the pace while carving decent fractions along the backstretch run,
dictated terms while clear into the far turn, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased WE CAN to the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. HYDRO
FROST allowed to settle in the early running, raced four wide into the first turn, tracked the decent pace while widest through the backstretch run, mounted a
four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ELEGANT SWAY was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the moderate early pace three wide nearing the half-mile marker, gained ground three
wide into the turn and loomed approaching the top of the lane, vied for the lead heading to the furlong marker and took command at mid-stretch, kicked to a
clear lead into the final sixteenth and held sway in the late stages. ICONIC SKY was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the early pace from between
rivals, came in tight and checked approaching the half-mile marker, was shuffled back and tracked two wide into the turn, waited for racing room at the
quarter marker, found room into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, bid between rivals into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep
stretch and got up in the final strides to secure second in a blanket finish for the minor awards. THE GREAT HAYNES prominent away from the start, rated
just off of the moderate early pace and stalked two to three wide into the turn, came in tight and was boxed in nearing the quarter marker, tipped out into the
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while just getting up for third. TESSA (GB) raced
close up to the moderate early pace while four to five wide, advanced nearing the half-mile marker and pressed the pace two to three wide into the turn, vied
for the lead at the quarter marker then met the bid of ELEGANT SWAY into upper stretch, battled that rival past the furlong marker, could not keep pace into
the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was tagged for the minor awards. SWIFT NONNI showed good early speed, assumed command and set a
pressured pace heading to the half-mile marker, contested the moderate pace into the turn, came under pressure in upper stretch and battled to the furlong
marker, could not find a response into the final sixteenth and faded in the late stages. CODE RIBBON took back off of the moderate early pace, was guided
three to four wide into the turn and gained ground at the quarter marker, swung widest into the stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and finished
evenly in the final stages.

Footnotes
TOWN PERFORMER broke outward at the start, causing a minor chain reaction to the outside runners, tracked in third while racing three wide, continued
that path through the turn, was set down at the top of the stretch, finished strong under a vigorous hand ride and got up in the last jump.
EVENEREVENWORSE was quickest away, set a fast pace but had something left for the stretch run, finished well under strong handling, was fully
extended to the wire and just missed. SHARONA'S WILD BOY was floated outward after the break but otherwise broke well but was outrun early, settled
near the back then angled over to the inside when clear, got a nice ground saving run thorough the turn building to a strong rally up the rail, finished willingly
but came up a bit short. HIGHLAND GHOST broke well but ceded the lead to EVENEREVENWORSE, stayed close while chasing that rival through the turn,
moved to challenge passing the quarter pole, finished with good energy but was outkicked in a blanket finish. LOOKIN TO EXCEL was off a little awkwardly
trying to avoid HIGHLAND GHOST at the break, made steady forward progress down the backstretch and through the turn, was making a bid inside then
altered course to the two path in mid-stretch then had to steady in the final yards to lose all chance. DEBS TIZ was forced outward at the break to avoid
TOWN PERFORMER, settled mid-pack when unable to keep up with the hot early pace, lost some ground on the turn when several kicked away, was put
into a drive and was slow to respond but did kick in deep stretch but was too late. HONEYMOONZ OVER was off a step slow then forced outward and
squeezed a bit to avoid horses on the inside after the break, trailed the field early, raced four wide down the backstretch and through the turn and lacked a
late kick.

Footnotes
MOBOU was forwardly placed leaving the start, raced close up to the early pace and went three wide along the first turn, was well placed into the
backstretch run and tracked the pace while widest nearing the half-mile pole, was roused four wide into the far turn and loomed into upper stretch, battled
for the lead into the lane, responded to urging past mid-stretch and dueled ANITANEWMERCEDES into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch
and lasted in the final strides for a determined win. MOGOLLON RIM broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried in the early going and
saved ground into the first turn, was content to trail through the backstretch run, gained ground two wide nearing the quarter marker, angled five wide into
upper stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, rallied while widest into the final sixteenth, closed with a rush in deep stretch and missed for the win,
while getting up in time to secure second. ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly and was prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace three wide
into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, advanced into the far turn and pressured TRIBAL NATION while three wide
nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead between rivals into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, took a short lead nearing the sixteenth-pole,
drifted in under left handed encouragement into the final sixteenth, fought gamely in deep stretch and was bested for the win and place in the final strides,
while just holding for show honors at the finish. AMERICAN FARMER was allowed to settle and raced two wide into the first turn, gained ground along the
backstretch and tracked the decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, chased two to three wide into the second turn then came in tight nearing the quarter
marker, continued to race in traffic into the stretch, altered course in the final sixteenth and was gaining in deep stretch but ran out of time. TRIBAL NATION
hard sent leaving the start, assumed early command and showed the way into the first turn while off of the rail, set decent fractions through the backstretch
run, came under pressure into the second turn and led to the quarter pole, met the bid of oncoming rivals into the stretch, stubbornly battled into the final
sixteenth, was crowded and checked in deep stretch and weakened in the final stages. ARMA D'ORO settled leaving the start while not far back, saved
ground into the first turn, was well placed into the backstretch run and improved position nearing the half-mile, saved all of the ground into the far turn,
chased the leaders to the quarter marker, maintained an inside position into the stretch and could not muster the needed response in the late stages.

Footnotes
TOUCH OF ZEN settled in the second flight leaving the start, maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run and was content to track the decent pace
nearing the half-mile marker, was roused four wide into the second turn and loomed into upper stretch, closed determinedly past mid-stretch, wore down the
runner-up in the final stages and edged away to prevail at the finish. CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked from the inside
heading into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the
second turn and took command at the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into upper stretch, felt pressure from TOUCH OF ZEN past the furlong marker and
met that rival's bid into the final sixteenth, could not hold off the winner in deep stretch and was second best. LAURA'S KIDOUGH allowed to settle in the
early stages, saved ground into the first turn and maintained an inside position through the backstretch run, was guided two wide into the far turn and gained
ground at the quarter marker, came in tight at the top of the stretch and checked off of heels at the three-sixteenths, mounted a bit while in traffic nearing the
furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and held well in the end for third. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) took back off of the early pace, was a bit
rank into the first turn and settled two wide into the backstretch run, was unhurried to the half-mile marker and saved ground into the second turn, was full of
run into the stretch then raced in tight at the furlong marker, found room into the final sixteenth, was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for third at the
wire. MACLEAN'S RHYME was off a step slowly leaving the start, recovered and tracked the early pace from the second flight, was well positioned into the
backstretch run and tracked the decent fractions approaching the half-mile, chased two wide into the second turn and advanced at the quarter pole while a
bit in tight, found room into the stretch and continued his bid at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep
stretch. COUNT ASHER hustled away from the start, was prominent in the early stages and stalked the pace three wide into the first turn, attended to the
decent pace through the backstretch run, was well placed into the far turn and chased three wide nearing the quarter pole, was outkicked at mid-stretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF allowed to settle leaving the start, raced three wide into the first turn, was unhurried through the
backstretch run and was content to trail nearing the half-mile pole, went two wide into the second turn, gained ground in the stretch drive and offered a mild
late rally. ACERO took back off of the early pace, went two to three wide along the first turn, settled through the backstretch run then advanced two to three
wide along the far turn, swung widest for the stretch drive, could not sustain his run into the final furlong and did not factor in the late stages. DANZ TILL
TEN fractious in the starting gate, rushed up in the early stages and assumed command, set the pace into the first turn, carved out decent fractions while
making the pace along the backstretch run, came under pressure into the far turn and was overtaken nearing the quarter pole, tired in the stretch drive and
was not persevered with through the late stages.

Footnotes
PARTY WITH PADDY came away well, angled over towards the inside before the half mile marker putting a couple in tight quarters behind, dueled outside
of G G GILLEY to the quarter pole then shook free, opened up and easily held off a late bid from NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK to win in a solid effort.
NIGHTBIRDE IT'S OK was a little slow to get going but moved into contention before the turn, went three wide through the turn following the path of PARTY
WITH PADDY, came into the stretch with only that rival to beat, dove to an opening to the inside for clear run, finished up strong under steady handling but
was second best while well clear of the next horse. G G GILLEY rushed up after the break to join PARTY WITH PADDY on the lead, dueled with that rival to
the quarter pole, was unable to go on with the top pair but stayed on into the final sixteenth and just held for third at the wire. HOT GOBLIN broke alertly but
veered out into the path of RIOLO, was up with the leaders through the initial furlong then backed off to a tracking position, checked slightly at the half mile
marker then again approaching the five-sixteenths pole while boxed in, got clear in upper stretch then finished up well under strong handling and intermittent
urging to just miss out a minor award. BERTACCHI was slow into stride and dropped far back early, advanced some before the turn then launched a brief,
mild rally in the three path from the seven sixteenths pole, swung five to six wide into the stretch and finished well enough to improve a couple of places.
UNBRIDLED RHYTHM broke in at the break and knocked TRIANGLE into RIOLO, was outrun in the early going, chased three wide to the turn, went into a
stiff drive from with three furlongs to run, loomed a threat approaching the stretch then flattened out. TRIANGLE broke awkwardly then was pinballed while
trying to straighten out, rushed up eagerly into contention,then had to be throttled back a couple of times by the rider to avoid running up heels, dropped
back a bit heading into the turn then came back on when put into a stiff drive from the three furlong pole, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in and was
unable to improve. RIOLO was hard to load, then at the break veered sharply to the outside and was bumped by TRIAGLE as part of a chain reaction from
the adjacent stalls, dropped to the back of the field and chased to the far turn while searching for a clear path, stayed to the inside through the turn and was
put into a drive from the seven sixteenths but was unable to improve while drifting out down the stretch.
