Footnotes
MAMAN JOON (IRE) trailed the field while saving ground, commenced her bid entering the far turn, circled the field on the turn, came six wide into the lane,
closed strongly outside, kicked clear under urging and was in hand the final yards. HIGH STICK pulled while tracked along the inside, waited for room on the
far turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied inside and narrowly earned the place award. LADY MADONNA raced off the rail, off the pace, bid four wide at
the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch run and just missed for second. GRAY VIXEN was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace inside, rode the rail
into the stretch and rallied mildly inside. DEA MATRONA (FR) stalked two wide, bid three wide at the quarter pole and was outkicked. LOST MY SOCK
raced off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane, angled out and closed belatedly outside. THE CLASSY ONE steadied in tight leaving the chute,
raced off the pace, between rivals on the far turn and lacked a rally. POSTINO'S PROPHECY set the pace on the inside, dueled into the stretch and tired.
JUDGEMENT TIME stalked close up two wide, bid on the far turn and faded.
