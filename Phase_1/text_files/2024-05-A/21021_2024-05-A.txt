Footnotes
CHARGE THE CASTLE broke a step slow and brushed with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path around the turn shifted to the
four path in upper stretch, rallied while hanging on his left lead and reel in the leader in the final sixteenth and drove clear. BROTHER RICE hopped slightly
at the start, set a clear pace around the turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, held sway from chasers through midstretch but was caught by an outer
rallying-rival in the final sixteenth then held place. THANKS FRANK stalked along the inside, tipped to the two path turning for home, chased the clear
leader through midstretch, but was outkicked for place by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, kept on in hopes of reclaiming that position from a tiring rival,
but was denied. EQUATE tracked from the four path into the turn, sustained pursuit tucking to the three path turning for home, but only managed to chase in
upper stretch, lacked a bid and held fourth. MOONOVERMONTGOMERY saved ground while under urging off of the pace around the turn, split foes to
advance two wide in upper stretch and ran on mildly. LEAD FOOT lacked speed three wide, then stayed on between horses while taking contact from an
outer rival at the furlong grounds and missed a minor share. ERASMUS brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path, shfited
to the five path in upper stretch, drifted about hanging on his left lead and bumped an inner rival at the furlong grounds, then tired. ONE SHARP TIZ pursued
from the four path, floated to the six path in upper stretch, faded and was found to have bled. PERSCRIPTURE made little impact two wide. CAMPBELL
COVERS lacked speed four wide and never got involved. CENTRIFUGAL FORCE raced forwardly in the three to two path and between horses into the
turn, but weakened leaving the three furlong pole. GIMME LOVE broke many lengths slow and showed little.

Footnotes
AORAKI broke a step slow, pursued four wide before tucking to the three path entering the turn, tracked around the bend before tipping back to the four
path to take aim outside of the top pair entering the lane, bid while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, forged an advantage leaning inwardly entering
midstretch and inched clear. FLAMING GLORY vied two wide and between horses into the turn, clung to an advantage from her outer counterpart while
remaining a path off of the rail turning for home, disposed of that one as a wider bidder menaced in upper stretch, got bested by that one reaching the
furlong grounds, then narrowly saved place from an outer challenger at the wire. TIFFANY nudged the inner stall door upon leaving the gate, raced
forwardly along the inside, checked behind a rival nearing the five sixteenths pole, shfited out to the four path entering the lane and ran on well to miss
reaching place. DAISY DUKE raced off of the pace in the three path and in a bit tight among foes into the turn, got floated out to the five path entering the
lane, then to the six path while chasing in midstretch, yet stayed on well late to secure a minor share. GRACE ON GRACE vied inside of a pair of foes into
the turn, but chased turning for home and yielded. MACLEAN'S LULLABY steadied among foes early on, pursued from the two path, shifted out to the four
to five path to be between horses at the furlong grounds, then improved without threatening. BAYTOWN CLEOPATRA prompted three deep into the turn,
sustained vying position outside of the leader and in the the three path around the turn, but weakened while getting outkicked by an outer bidder in upper
stretch. BAYTOWN SHINJUKU broke a step slow, trialed in the three path and made little impact. STARLIGHT BELLA dropped her head just before the
gates sprung and broke multiple lengths slow, raced off of the pace in the four to six path and tired.

SOARING BIRD stalked along the inside, took aim between the top pair and from the three path entering the lane, progressed to bid inside of the leader at
the furlong grounds, edged ahead and held sway. FIGURETI (CHI) broke out and bumped foes at the start, tracked in the four path, got floated to the five
path entering the lane, took aim chasing the leaders into midstretch, yet ran on to close in with a sixteenth to go, edged place late and needed more to catch
the leader. SIR OLLIE stalked outside of the leader before pressing from the three path around the turn, wrestled a narrow advantage entering the lane in
the four path, but was headed by an inner bidder passing the furlong grounds and yielded place to an outer rival late. FITZPATRICK broke inwardly and
bumped rivals at the start, pursued from the five path before floating to the six path entering the lane, and chased willingly. THE QUEENS JULES set a
pressured pace along the inside around the turn, got headed entering the lane then gave way through the final furlong. HERD IMMUNITY was slammed
between horses and pinched back at the start, trailed along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane and surpassed a tiring rival without
threatening. VOODOO ZIP bobbled and got rank once bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, pursued from the three path before tucking
inwardly turning for home, and faded.

Footnotes
SHARPER GAL stalked three deep into the turn, ranged up in hand to the clear leader in upper stretch, swept past nearing the furlong grounds and drew off
under little urging. MORNING MIRACLE was bumped by an outer rival at the start, got floated inwardly by that one and forced to steady with eleven
sixteenths to go, chased from midpack three wide around the turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, then stayed on willingly to claim place in the
final sixteenth. NO MAP NEEDED raced at the rear along the inside around the turn, advanced moving to the four path entering the lane, shifted in and rally
to gain show late. SONG BRIDGE raced off of the pace in the four to five path and ran on mildly. WHISKEY WILD broke in and bumped a rival at the start,
set the pace inside of a pressing foe into the turn, drew clear of that one leaving the three furlong pole, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge
reaching midstretch and faltered. DICE ARM lacked speed in the two to three path, fanned out to the six path entering the lane and failed to factor. XTRA
EXTRAORDINARY chased along the inside and faded around the turn. BRIGHT LADY DAY rushed forward to prompt outside of the leader approaching the
bend, then weakened with three furlongs to go. UOME pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, cut the corner turning for home and tired.
ELLIOTT MOON lacked speed in the four path and showed little.

Footnotes
KATTATH prompted three deep, cleared entering the lane and edged away under a drive. GLOBAL SENSATION laid off of the pace in the three to two path
into the turn, shifted back out to the three path while progressing in upper stretch, stayed on between horses to claim place leaving the furlong grounds and
fended off an outer rival. MOBSTER GUN tracked from the two path, shfited out to the four path entering the lane, bid for place along with an inner rival
leaving the furlongs grounds, but was fended off through the late stages. KAHALA brushed with an outer rival early on, vied two wide and between horses,
yielded to his outer counterpart entering the lane, lost place to an outer pair leaving the furlong grounds and gave way. ALL WEST pursued from off of the
pace in the four to five path and failed to menace. GREENER PASTURES vied for the inside of a pair of rivals around the turn, but yielded entering the lane
and weakened hanging on his left lead. FLAGS UP raced at the rear three wide and failed to factor between horses. CANDY FOR CARMEL was brushed
and put to tight quarters among foes early on, then saved ground off of the pace to no avail. IMPROBABLE STORY stalked two wide, chased in the three
path around the turn and weakened entering the lane in the four path.

Footnotes
HURRY HURRY stalked three wide, bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, leaned inwardly forging an advantage in upper stretch, then drove clear
entering the final sixteenth. SINGLE DOT YAHT settled off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride in the four path around the far turn, tipped to take
aim outside of the leaders in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to edge place at the sixteenth pole and held from an inner bidder. NEXT LEVEL was
bumped by an inner rival and pinched back between horses early on, rated at the rear in the four to three path, cut the corner inching closer entering the
lane, tipped three wide in midstretch, stayed on between horses to offer an inside bid for place in the late stages but was kept at bay. MIDNIGHT RAID
pressed two wide, bid along with an outer rival entering the lane, got headed and floated inwardly inwardly by that one in upper stretch, then yielded in the
final furlong. KITTY HAWK bobbled slightly while breaking on top, showed the way along the inside, but was headed by an outer pair in upper stretch and
weakened. KISSALOT shifted out and brushed a foe early on, pursued from midpack under snug restraint along the inside, but weakened around the far
turn and was eased through the lane.

WHISKEY DECISION pursued from midpack three to four wide, ranged up turning for home to bid outside of the leading trio entering the lane and kicked
away readily. RAGTIME LADY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, awaited racing room behind foes around the far turn, swung five wide
entering upper stretch and rallied to reach place in the closing stages. GRECIAN GODDESS bumped with an outer rival upon leaving the gate, pursued
from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted three wide with five furlongs to go to track the leaders approaching the far turn, inched closer to bid
three wide around that bend, vied as an outer rival joined the fray entering the lane, but proved no match for that one in upper stretch, yielded and lost place
late. GOLD LIGHTNING transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe at the start, settled off of the pace three to four wide, then ran on evenly.
BELLA HAZE hopped slightly and bumped with an inner rival at the start, showed the way moving to the inside around the first turn, got headed while inside
of a pair of rivals turning for home, yielded to a trio of foes entering the lane and faded. CAIRO STREET stalked two wide, bid along with an outer rival
around the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. BELLA CRUELLA broke in and brushed a rival at the start, was forced to brush another
inner rival while shifting down early on, stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. LADY HELENA was bumped by an outer rival at the
start, trailed along the inside and made little impact. SMILING ELLIE steadied early on when put to cramped rail quarters by outer rivals early on, then saved
ground off of the pace to no avail. FANCY LOOKER was brushed by outer rivals and steadied in tight along the inside early on, pursued keenly from
midpack along the inside, chased two wide and between horses around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
MAC DADDY TOO laid off of the pace two wide, shfited to the five path into the turn before fanning to the six path in upper stretch, yet sustained grinding
progress outside of rivals in the final furlong and edged past the leaders late. LUNAR MODULE stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair in
upper stretch, sustained slow progress to bid at the sixteenth pole, but missed to an outer rival. TILTED TOWERS prompted two wide, vied in the three path
in upper stretch, exchanged brushes with the early leader in the final furlong and got outkicked by an outer pair late. PURE PANIC showed the way inside of
a prompting foe, sparred with that one after shifting off the inside entering upper stretch, exchanged brushes and was bested by wider challengers late.
BEYOND BEST bumped with an inner rival at the start, lagged behind into the turn, picked up stride in the four path in upper stretch and offered a belated
surge among foes in the closing stages. TIMELESS BOUNTY raced forwardly in the three path and between horses, took aim in the five path in upper
stretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side leaving the furlong grounds and lacked a bid. EFFICIENCY bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked
speed two wide, awaited racing room turning for home, then stayed on mildly among foes. LIKE A SALTSHAKER laid off o the pace along the inside and
chased up the rail. SOLIDIFY was hung in the six to seven path while well back and made little impact. HOCUS raced forwardly in the four path but
weakened between horses with five sixteenths to go.
