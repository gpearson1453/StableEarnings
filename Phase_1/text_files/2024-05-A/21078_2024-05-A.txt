BETSY IS THE CODE was crowded and forced to steady after the break, circling out to upper stretch would fire in the closing yards to get up in time. MY
GIRL GABBY pressed the pace wresting a short lead in upper stretch digging in late missing between horses. SMOOKIE broke sharply to the early lead
being hooked on the turn ceding grudgingly in upper stretch battling on to the end from the rail. AWESOME INCENTIVE raced evenly failing to contend.
THIS ONE CAN RUN crowded rival at the break staying back throughout.

MAUREENLOVESFRANK away alertly set the pace being pressed on the far turn digging in down the lane drifting toward the rail late. ALICIA'S WAY
stalked the pace pressing in bid on the far turn chasing three deep down the lane getting up for place. CAGUA advanced on the backside saving ground to
vie down the stretch being put in tight along the rail in the closing yards. POLYESTER BRIDE tracked evenly to upper stretch racing three path there
finishing in close quarters between horses the final yards. MAMBO KITTEN stalked the pace pressing three deep on the far turn weakening four wide down
the lane. HONEY BOURBON played no factor. SHAOLIN folded up early being eased in upper stretch making the wire walking off after the race. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF POLYESTER BRIDE AGAINST THE RIDER OF ALICIA WAY FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS
DENIED BY THE STEWARDS.
