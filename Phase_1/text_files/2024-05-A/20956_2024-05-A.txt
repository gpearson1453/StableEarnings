Footnotes
IF YOU WANT IT was unhurried early, rallied into the turn, swung wide entering the stretch, dueled for the lead and prevailed in an all out effort. GOLDEN
GOPHER was never far back, rallied around the turn, was carried out entering the stretch, closed steadily and was gaining late. HURRICAIN HUNTER was
rated along the inside while never far off the pace, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed willingly and got up for show. TALES OF MAKENNA broke
out, raced in close, rallied four wide into the turn to challenge, dueled for the lead and didn't have enough late. BANGIE GO challenged for the lead along
the backstretch, drew clear briefly, responded when challenged to duel and hung late to lose position. RIVETING SPIRIT was unhurried early, went widest
in the drive and offered a mild bid to improve position. LUNAR UNIT led around the first turn, vied to the second turn, tired and gave way.

MAESTOSO vied three across to the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held well. RANGER JOE settled off the pace, angled out for the drive and
finished well. SANDMAN'S LEGACY was crowded and bumped at the start, lagged early, found his best stride late and got up for show. SPORT COAT
raced in the back in an outside trip and improved position in an steady effort. IMA RASCAL raced mid pack, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked the
needed late response. TWO MORE SHOTS failed to threaten in an even effort. GOTHAM'S FINALE came out at the start, vied between horses and leveled
off in the drive. ROGUE FORCE was crowded and bumped at the start and outrun. EFFORT vied inside to the turn, dropped back and gave way.

Footnotes
JESSICA BLAH BLAH set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. NOT NOW I'M BIZZIE stalked the pace, lacked
the needed late response and was no match for the winner. UPTOWN RHAPSODY was slow early, closed steadily and got up for show. DORITA'S HAPPY
was never far back, lacked a rally and failed to menace. HAUGHTY KITTY showed speed to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. SANTALUZ
DREAM bobbled at the start and passed tiring rivals in an even effort. FLATTER ME ZEN was crowded and steadied after the start, taken wide and showed
little. ROYAL DANIELLE led early, showed speed to the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
JACKS OUTLAW was rated while racing along the inside, angled out on the second turn, assumed command at the top of the stretch, inched clear and held
safely. ARREST rallied around the turn, bid willingly to threaten, didn't have enough late and finished second best. FLY NIGHTLY was unhurried early, bid
along the rail on the second turn, shifted out, closed steadily and got up for show while no threat to the top two. LEGALLY REDDY improved position in an
even effort. NASHVILLE SKYLINE pressed the pace while racing two across, challenged on the turn, flattened out and dropped back.. PAID IN FULL was
through after a half. VITALE was not a factor. WESTWARD LOOK set a pressured pace to the second turn, tired and gave way. ROSENQUIST raced in the
second flight, tired into the second turn and stopped.

Footnotes
I'M NOBLE pressed the pace, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up late. I AM FREAKY FAST raced close to the pace, fell back on the second
turn, swung wide entering the stretch, found his best stride late and was gaining ground. YOU'REINTHEARMYNOW was hustled along to set the pace,
responded when challenged to duel and was outfinished in a game effort. DE LA LUNA was unhurried early, swung wide leaving the turn, finished well and
was gaining late. SECRET POTION rallied into the second turn to loom a threat, came up empty and fell back. STREET HUMOR stalked the pace along the
inside, bid off the rail to contend and faltered near the sixteenth pole. SIPPIN WHISKEY was outrun in an even effort. GENERAL CROOK broke awkwardly,
raced in close, was through after a half and dropped back steadily. BAYOU CHROME showed little.

Footnotes
KENNEBEC was never far back, closed steadily and wore down his rivals to get up near the wire. HOUSE OF LORDS was never far back, bid inside
leaving the turn to duel for the lead, inched clear late and was caught at the wire to just miss. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR dueled to mid stretch, fell back, continued
willingly to the wire and held for show. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT set a pressured pace, responded to duel and was unable to sustain his bid.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT improved position in an steady effort. BIG BUZZ was not a factor. HAPI HAPI contended early, tired and gave way. BEL
RAGAZZO was outrun.
