Footnotes
ROCKET SANDERS took command after the start, showed the way through the first turn in the two path, rated in the run up the backstretch and into the far
turn while remaining off the rail, responded when challenged into the lane, drifted out steadily, enough left to last for part of the win. BLESSED VISION
closest to the leader outside that one, called on for some run far turn, inched closer on the outside turning for home, extended stretch duel while being
floated out by ROCKET SANDERS, just up at the wire to gain the nod and earn the dead heat. MR. BUTCH off a step slow, lacked early foot just off the
inside, angled out sharply turning for home, closest to the top two upper stretch, steered in as those two were coming out, failed to manage any late gain on
that pair, well clear of the others. CRABTREE within striking distance while racing four wide through both turns, lacked a closing response. OUTLAW RUN
in some traffic in the first turn, steadied late in that bend from between horses, moved a bit closer after a half, went flat through the lane. BRADFORD in mid
pack and inside, inched up the rail only to lack room with four furlongs remaining, proceeded evenly to the wire. MANDATORY MISSION forwardly placed
along the inside, steadily faded after a half. DOUBLECHECK stumbled at the start, raced four wide in the turn, retreated, jogged in. DAY JO off slow,
stopped in the second turn, also jogged across.

Footnotes
TRUE PRINCESS pressed the leader from the outside in the three path, engaged that one into the stretch, put a head in front approaching the furlong
marker, edged clear then held the runner up safe late. TOFFEE within striking distance, came three wide for the drive, slowly getting to the winner in the late
going. QUIERO DINERO in mid pack while saving some ground turn, steered out in the two path the drive, up late for the show, no threat to the top two.
PLEASINGLY broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path and in hand, briefly offered some resistance to the winner when that one
came calling turning for home, began to weaken when headed by that one at midstretch, continued to weaken, caught late for the show spot. SUBWAY
SUSIE in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. SASSY LASS when one paced throughout while racing three
wide. MOLLY OF STRATFORD in the second flight along the inside, had little for the drive. WHAT'S TO DO in tight at the break to be off a step slow, four to
five wide through the turn, lacked a closing rally. CUPID'S MUSIC off a step slow, remained back. UNSTABLE PRINCESS void of speed, four to five wide
through the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
CHROME'S ECHO broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, continued to set the pace up the backstretch while just off
the inside, larger lead into the stretch, remained clear to the wire in holding the runner up safe under steady handling. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT pressed the
winner in the three path, fell back off that one turning for home, roused, trying to get back to that same rival late while narrowly holding the nod for the place.
BIG ANDY MORT off a step slow, raced back and toward the inside early, moved out backstretch, advanced four to five wide turning for home, finished
willingly to miss the place. PEARCY ROAD settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the final turn, not enough late for the place with some mild
interest. SECRET STRATEGY off a step slow, trailed well back, three wide into the stretch, improved position with some mild interest through traffic.
SUNDAY SPIRIT forwardly placed outside, four wide through the turns, lacked a closing kick through the lane. GREAT BARRIER failed to menace while
racing off the inside. GOD'S COUNTRY in the second flight while three wide early, moved inside second turn, came up empty for the stretch run. GENTLE
BEN forwardly placed early along the inside, steadily retreated. MANSOURA in mid pack and inside early, moved off the rail, in traffic late in the final turn,
backed up in the drive. GET AWAY WITH IT fractious in the gate, was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MUSICMANSANDY pressed the issue while racing three wide, took over turning for home, kicked well clear under steady handling. HEATED ARGUMENT
behind the pace while racing three wide, advanced to be closest to the winner past the furlong marker, no match for that one, clearly second best. PETULA
behind the first fight off the rail. TOO PRETTY took over after the start, dueled with the winner inside that one late in the turn, began to weaken in upper
stretch, chased the winner past the furlong marker, weakened in the final furlong. RUN FEARLESS lacked early foot, saved ground in the turn, improved
position. LADY ASTRID lacked speed, came five wide into the lane, lacked a serious rally. DELTA MOON in the second flight outside, four wide through the
turn, lacked a closing kick. DOUGHTY went one paced while three wide. MOCHA KISS raced back off the pace and the inside, swung five wide into the
lane, lacked a closing response. SHE'S STORMING was finished early. MAGNOLIA MAE prompted the pace for a half along the inside, gave way.
SHUTUP PLEASE last away, trailed.

Footnotes
BATON ROUGE moved up inside after the start to set the pace, drew out steadily after a half under a steady hand ride past the furlong marker, geared
down late to win ridden. MOUNT CRAIG void of speed, three to four wide in the second turn, rallied to be clear for the place, no match for the winner.
COACH JIMI D carried out six wide into the first turn, raced back up the backstretch, checked into the far turn in traffic, recovered and came three wide for
the drive, no threat to the top two, narrowly saved the show. RONALDINHO carried seven wide into the first turn, angled in a bit to save some ground,
advanced into contention three wide with a middle move, chased winner 2nd turn, weakened a bit in the drive to be outkicked for the show. P R CALL ME
MAYBE lacked away, lacked speed while saving ground, began to advance far turn, waited briefly along the rail late in final turn, slipped through, improved
slightly then flattened out a bit late. RIDE FOR SUL lacked speed, was racing back when steadied three furlongs out, three wide into the lane, improved
upper then flattened out. CHARBON carried five wide into the first turn, within striking distance, tired after five furlongs. RYNO WRECKER broke alertly,
forwardly placed for five furlongs, gave way. MEMPHIS PHAROAH got out into the first turn, pressed the winner early, stopped, finished far back.

Footnotes
WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) moved out, pressed the leader two to three wide through the turn, challenged between horses into the lane, edged clear late
under steady handling. TOP GUNNER forwardly placed three wide, ranged up to challenge four wide into the lane, raced on equal terms with the winner
outside that one past the furlong marker, outkicked by that same rival late while holding sway for the place. I'M WIDE AWAKE broke sharp, set the pace
toward the inside, vied past the furlong marker, also was outfinished in the late going. CITY OF CLOUDS behind the pace just off the inside, came in the two
path through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. PALACE KITTEN fell back to trail after the start, dropped inside far turn, improved into the lane,
flattened out in the drive. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS back off the pace and the inside, swung five wide turning for home, lacked a closing kick. ROB THE RICH
back off the pace and the inside, floated out six wide into the lane, also came up empty for the stretch run. BOOGIE BODE off a step slow, was finished
early.

Footnotes
HENRO back off the pace, four wide out of the turn when challenging, kicked clear. PLAUSIBLE DENILE void of early foot, also was four wide out of the
turn, rallied while remaining out in the strip to be clear for the place. STORMS HOME lacked speed inside, moved out into the two path midway on the turn,
rallied inside the runner up through upper stretch, could not match that one the final furlong, finished up best of the rest. RISK IT in the second flight off the
inside, three wide late in the turn, lacked a closing punch. STRATO moved out, pressed the leader off the inside into the turn, took over, weakened when
headed the final furlong. KONTEEKEE went one paced throughout along the inside. CONGRATS ON FIFTY broke on top, was clear early, held advantage
through the turn, gave way when headed entering the stretch. EXCITABLE BOY forwardly placed for a half in the three path, weakened in the drive.
INTERLOCK EMPIRE off a step slow, remained always back. FLYING HOUDINI faded while four to five wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
DIMATIC in the second flight off the inside, between foes far turn, inched closer under confident handling to challenge three wide into the stretch, held sway
down the lane under steady handling. GIVE ME A REASON chased the leader off the inside, moved closer and challenged midway on the final turn, dueled
briefly then vied between horses upper stretch to the furlong marker, could not match the winner late, proved stubborn in holding the place. AWESOME
ROAD settled off the pace along the inside, moved closer in the second turn, set down for the drive, outkicked late for the place. EL DINERO lacked speed
while three wide early, moved to the inside, advanced, two path into the lane, continued to improve upper stretch, flattened out to lose the show late. I'M
YOUR MAN off a step slow, trailed early, moved out, four wide in the second turn, improved position with some belated interest. WILLY D'S settled in mid
pack early three wide, two path second turn, lacked a closing response. BIG TO DO moved up to be clear after the start, showed the way up the
backstretch, responded when the runner up challenged midway on the second turn into the lane, weakened in the drive. PAPPY'S REVENGE off a step
slow, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive. COUNT DRACULA four wide when within striking distance in the first turn, three wide through the second
when beginning to tire, continued to weakened through the lane. GOLDEN PLATE was never a factor while racing off the inside.

AUTO GLIDE unhurried inside, began to move far turn, moved out to the two path around a tiring rival midway on the final turn, dropped back to the inside
for the drive, rallied up the rail to be in time. RECKER POINT broke alertly, set the pace toward the inside, larger advantage into far turn, responded when
challenged soon after dueled, could not contain the winner while proving game for the place. DANCE SOME MO forwardly placed while three wide,
advanced on the runner up in the far turn, dueled with that one through upper stretch and past the furlong marker, outfinshed by that same rival for the
place, clear of the others. ST ANDREWS within striking distance while racing three wide, continued in contention turning for home, went evenly to the wire in
lacking a closing response. INEXORABLE off a step slow, raced four wide in the first turn, remained outside and was four wide again late in the second
bend, also went one paced through the lane in lacking a closing response. CALRISSIAN went one paced throughout while in the two path. TRIGGER
HAPPY settled in mid pack while just off the inside through the first turn, three wide through the second bend, had little left for the stretch drive. C F V
BULLET unruly in the post parade and prior to the start, unprepared then broke in the air to spot the field several lengths, raced back, 4w into the lane,
passed tiring rivals while never a threat. HEIR TO GREATNESS off a step slow, remained back. PHANTOM RIDE hesitated at the break, moved up to race
in mid pack before a half, backed up through the stretch. SOUTHERN SUNSET pressed the runner early, continued forwardly for five furlongs then stopped
second turn, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
FROSTED DEPARTURE broke in good order, showed the way into and through the first turn inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to set the
pace far turn, drew out steadily through the lane while kept to pressure. STRONG TIDE tracked the winner from along the inside, moved out a bit for the
drive, closed the gap on NAUTICAL STAR late to finish on equal terms with that one. NAUTICAL STAR forwardly placed while off the inside, prompted the
winner in the two path, continued to pursue that one through the final turn, could do little with that same rival through the stretch, fully extended to last for
part of the place. BEN FRANKLIN void of speed while four wide into the first turn, angled in, dropped to the rail for the second turn, displayed some mild
interest up the inside to improve position, no real threat. SILVER PROSPECTOR off a step slow, raced forwardly and three wide for six furlongs, came up
empty for the drive. AIN'T LIFE GRAND three to four wide first turn, continued outside, four wide through the second bend while within striking distance,
tired through the lane. LAW PROFESSOR made little impact while racing toward the inside.

furlongs, vied between horses through the third turn, came three wide for the drive, long drive, proved game to narrowly miss. RUNGIUS in a bit tight just
after the start, moved up to join the first group three wide before a half, continued to vie on the outside, four wide into the lane, equal terms with the top two
past the furlong marker, bested late, remained well clear for the show. MYSTERY MO forwardly placed along the inside, asked along late in the final bend,
went evenly through the stretch, lacked a closing kick in finishing up evenly. BIG PAPER void of speed toward the inside, moved out a bit for the second
turn, four to five wide in the final bend, staged a mild rally to continue and improve position, no real threat. CANADIAN PHAROAH settled in mid pack while
off the inside, went one paced throughout in lacking a rally. POLTERER took command soon after the start, set most all of the pace inside, vied final turn,
faltered when headed entering the stretch. ROYAL ACT saved ground to no avail. WHAT A COUNTRY fell back, lagged for ten furlongs, three wide into the
stretch, passed tiring horses while never a threat. EL MIC TIESUN in tight just after the start, steadied, raced well back in the three path through all three
turns, remained well back. FETCHS BRAHM off a step slow, was never close. QUICK BUCK mid pack early, gave way, well back. MAKE NOISE in the
second flight for two of three turns, stopped, well beaten.
