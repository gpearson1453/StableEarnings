HOPPING HENRY veered out and made contact with Adios Cool Arrows leaving the gate then took over and rated a slim lead, contested the edge two deep
through the turn, drifted through the upper stretch but dueled clear mid-stretch and drew off later yards. JUBA BOUND pressured the pace inside and
contested near even terms at the rail on the turn, dropped back mid-stretch but held on for second. TRIPLE BAD was bumped leaving the gate then gave
chase outside, rounded the turn about the five path then lugged in through the lane and was gaining on the runner-up. TIMMY chased inside, rounded the
turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. ADIOS COOL ARROWS was bumped outward and into Triple Bad then gave chase, rounded the turn off the
rail and flattened in the lane. OZONE gave chase then faded in the three path on the turn. SMOKIN SMITTY gave chase and raced off the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
MY HANDSOME MAN raced off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, started his bid past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path, dug in determinedly to take the lead in later yards and raced clear under the wire. JUDY'S ARMY settled off the rail on the first turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and dueled to a slim lead two deep midway on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but reluctantly ceded later
yards. TREJO saved ground on the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the four path, then flattened mid-stretch. AGAIN
WE MEET broke awkwardly and in and made contact with Cajun Joe then saved ground well off the pace, bid past the three eighths pole and improved
position about the four path on the far turn. THANK YA PETE raced with the early pace inside then closed to the lead approaching the three eighths pole,
was urged clear toward the quarter but gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. Z MYSTIQUE drifted to the four path
into the first turn, left the turn outside and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, but faded widest on the far turn. CAJUN JOE rated a slim lead two
deep, was met nearing the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn.

HAPPY CLOUDS stalked two deep on the first turn, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested at a close disadvantage through the far
turn, drew to even terms entering the stretch, took the nod a sixteenth away and inched ahead nearing the wire. LIGHTNIN RUNNER took an immediate
lead and rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Happy Clouds past the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was
met entering the stretch and dug in gamely, but grudgingly ceded the final sixteenth. MOONLIT SHADOW stalked inside, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn inside then flattened in the lane. DECO STRONG saved ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near
the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. AZZURRA rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response

Footnotes
AUBURN MILL took an immediate lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, kept the edge over Spritzer leaving the three eighths pole, came under
pressure passing the five sixteenths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over GOLDEN APPEAL in
later yards. The latter broke a bit awkwardly, raced in the five path the first turn then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, drew to near even terms
three wide on the far turn, cleared second toward mid-stretch but hung in later yards. POLAR WIND rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and finished well to take third the final strides. TAPIO rated close on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. SPRITZER stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three
eighths pole and dueled to even terms two deep while between horses on the far turn, but dropped back entering the stretch and flattened stride. MARK DID
IT raced in the three path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and weakened in the lane. RAISE A
SPEIGHTS showed little response. MUD BUG saved early ground and never factored.
