JAVA'S LUCKY LADY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, bid on the turn, dueled then edged off in the stretch. BOSSY KATE chased outside the
pacesetters then made gradual gain in the stretch. TREASURE PEACE hustled to clear advantage down the backstretch, was collared on the turn then
tired. MISSUPTOWNTOODELOU dropped far behind then offered mild rally along the inside. EMMA'S ABI lacked speed outside and failed to respond. MY
BROWN EYED GIRL dropped back in the two path and weakened steadily. YELOMA saved ground off the pace and gave way readily.

CLASSY MISS quickly took control, widened when ready after half a mile, continued to dominate and was ridden out. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE raced in
closest pursuit of the pacesetter, proved no match but held on for the place. MADAME ROUGE saved ground in the clear along the inside, angled out in the
stretch with a mild bid. MISS LOYALTY lagged far behind inside and was never a factor. CARLY HUSTLE chased outside under rating and was never in
contention. CANOOCHEE broke awkwardly and trailed throughout.

MAJESTIC LION was pinched back a bit after the start, outrun early, saved ground, advanced quickly on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch run,
charged to the front passing the furlong marker and pulled away under urging. RUSH CENTER set the pace racing with a clear early lead, showed the way
on the far turn, dueled in upper stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong and held for second. LEVEL UP tracked on the inside, then chased inside, rallied
between rivals entering the stretch, dug in and was outkicked for the place spot. DANCE A DINI stalked two wide, then chased, came four wide into the lane
and rallied mildly outside. WHITEWALKER stalked three wide, moved up into contention at the half mile marker, rallied outside entering the stretch, then
weakened. THE GATEKEEPER bobbled at the break, raced off the pace and did not factor. PARTY NEWS was outrun.

EXIT RIGHT controlled the pace inside, was threatened nearing midstretch then gamely held off that challenge in final stages. KINGSVILLE saved ground
close up, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat and made a gradual late gain. ROAN MOUNTAIN offered a menacing three wide bid after half a mile,
angled inside in the stretch and finished willingly. ZOOMER prompted stablemate for half a mile then faded on the final turn.

Footnotes
SPEIGHTSTER RED stalked two wide, moved up on the backside, bid two wide, dueled with VINE JET on the far turn, led into the stretch and drew clear
under urging. ANGELUS WARRIOR tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied outside for second. VINE
JET set the pace on the inside, was pressed on the backside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, weakened and held for third. YES SIR COLONEL
trailed the field, moved up five wide at the quarter pole, closed belatedly outside and got up for fourth. RERALLY stalked three wide, chased three wide on
the turn and had no rally. OLYMPIC ROMP raced off the pace inside and had no rally. IT'S GAME TIME raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten.
PETULANT DELIGHT pressed the pace early on, then chased three wide and gave way.
