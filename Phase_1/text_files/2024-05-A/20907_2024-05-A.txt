HYPNOCURRENCY just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a sixteenth out, inched away to the finish kept to task. ARMY OF THOUGHTS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the
inside through moderate splits, got set down angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under lone threat and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to
preserve the place honors. KEEP IT SEXY chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide for home and kicked on belatedly to the finish. LOVE LIKE CRAZY chased along the inside and pulled a bit keen down along
the rail with nine-sixteenths to run, tipped out three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, kept
on to the wire but was outfinished in the late going. SHASI chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn
coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. TWO REDHEADS three wide in pursuit down the backstretch,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and tipped out four to five wide through the turn, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired.
SHAYMYNAME chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the inside into the turn, came under coaxing just past the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
DAME CINCO pressed the pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn to gain a short lead leaving the three sixteenths, then was kept to crop
pressure and held off a stubborn ROMAN GRACE to prevail late. ROMAN GRACE broke out a tad and was a half a beat off slowly, then quickly moved up
the inside to set a pressured pace, then was in the two path on the turn while being still pressured by the winner, dueled off the turn and came three to four
wide into the lane, then fought on gamely to wire. KITTEN'S APPEAL was allowed to settle early, moved to the inside and saved ground on the turn, lacked
the needed stretch bid while clearly besting the rest. ADELIESE'S SMILE chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide off the
bend and was empty in the drive. TIMELY CONQUEST broke open the gate prior to the start, then chased the early pace and was four wide on the turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
ROYALTY INTEREST (FR) coaxed from the gate, established the front and loped along on the lead in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the far turn
taking away the cover of MCKULICK, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat
from a pair and held stubbornly and gamely to prevail. STAR FORTRESS (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside from the tail of the field, tipped to the two
path down the backstretch before heading back inside through the far and final turn, angled five wide into upper stretch roused for the drive, offered up a
good finish closing stoutly late and just missed at the finish. LA MEHANA (FR) tracked the front two to three wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and closed well through to the finish and was between foes late inside the final sixteenth and missed at
the end. MCKULICK (GB) raced forwardly placed two to three wide in closest aim of the leader and using her cover most of the way until that stable mate
tucked inside into the final turn, raced now in the clear and remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, kept on one
paced through to the finish and was outfinished in the final furlong. PARNAC (FR) tracked the pace along the inside, was patiently handled until let out
taking the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the final eighth.

STATUS SEEKER vied for the lead on the inside, made a bid on the turn to shake clear, then widened the margin off the bend and remained clear to the
wire to prove best under crop urging. SIX PACK SENORITA was well placed early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and came three wide to
make a bid but needed more late while being second best. ROMAN GODDESS tracked the pace and was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide off
the bend and offered a mild late rally. DAZZY vied for the lead three wide, then fell back leaving the five sixteenths and was two wide off the turn and
weakened. MUCHO MAMA MIA was settled back on the inside and was not a threat. JAY'S LOVE was settled back early, two wide on the turn and offered
no response. ST. BENEDICTS PREP stumbled at the start and lost the rider, walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING THE
START, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THERE WAS NO CHANGE AND THE RACE MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
CABLE READY brushed the near side stall at the start, settled tracking the pace along the inside in aim of the front, steadily dropped back in position to mid
pack, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole at the tail of the field, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied along the rail issuing a challenge a
sixteenth from home and was up over a rival in the last jumps to score. SONIC SPEED coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn
before tipping five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to take brief and narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker, then lost the bob and was nailed in
the final strides. LAUREL VALLEY raced forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn before dueling VETERANS BEACH down the backstretch
and through the far turn when four then three wide and outside his main pace rival, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive shaking off that
challenge confronted by a flanking duo and came inwards to look CABLE READY in the eye and forced SHINSUN to be taken in hand when collared just
inside the sixteenth pole and ran on to preserve the show honors. LEFTEMBEHIND three wide through the first turn, raced six paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
bid. WHISTLER'S HONOR just off the inside through the first turn, chased four the two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. SHINSUN coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside through the first turn before tipping to the
three path down the backstretch, tucked back inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home,
dug in under a drive making headway until forced to pause and steady a sixteenth out as LAUREL VALLEY came inwards, then finished in hand to the wire.
VETERANS BEACH established the front and showed the way tucking inside into the first turn, got joined by LAUREL VALLEY and dueled inside that rival
from the two path before heading back inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside at the head of the
stretch, got shaken off inside the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages and was in a bit tight a sixteenth out while backing away.

Footnotes
MESSIER vied for the early lead two wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to shake clear by the quarter pole, then widened the margin by the furlong
maker, and held POST TIME off late to prove best. POST TIME was reserved early on the inside, advanced midway on the turn and came two wide off the
turn, then angled out for racing room by the furlong marker and closed the gap late. CHARGE IT stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid by
the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive while staying on to clearly best the rest. WINIT tracked the pace three wide early, then was three to four wide
on the turn but faded in the drive. DR ARDITO was bumped slightly at the start, settled back early, saved ground on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the
turn but had no rally. WHITTINGTON PARK was settled early on the outside, then was wide on the turn and never threatened. ADERO vied for the lead on
the inside and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
UNION TRAIL established the front shortly after the start and showed the way crossing from the two path to the rail into the first turn, settled into a
comfortable rhythm in hand along the inside down the backstretch, remained on hold into the far turn before coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the finish. MASTER FREUD forwardly placed from the start, led briefly before easing
off to track the leader in closest aim from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch, ran on under a
drive chasing the winner home willingly to secure the place honors by a head over a late closing pair. MY LIFE STORY broke a half a beat slow, raced along
the inside and then just off the inside through the first turn before tipping three wide down the backstretch, tipped four wide through the far turn coming
under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and offered up a mild kick to close in tandem with DAKOTA COUNTRY and was just up
for the show honors on the line. DAKOTA COUNTRY broke a beat slow, chased just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths
to run, spun three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just miss for the show honors. ENGLISH CASTLE spun four wide into the first turn
before racing three wide through that bend, chased three wide and advanced before coming under urging with five-sixteenths remaining, cornered four wide
into upper stretch and was prominent to the furlong grounds, then weakened in the late stages. TONY O saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to the finish while offering no response.
OUTTAWATERBURY a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, got coaxed from the start and tracked the pace along the inside, came under a ride with
five-sixteenths remaining, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. NEPTUNE BEACH along the inside through the first turn, chased
three to four wide thereafter coming under coaxing five-sixteenths out, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. A LISTER spun five
wide into the first turn and tucked four then three wide through that bend, chased five to six wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the overland route five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. LAST DRINK chased along the inside coming
under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, tired.
