Footnotes
LOVE MY JIMMY was away quickly to lead the way from the inside, cleared the turn and lasted to the wire while drifting out late to prove best. POMEROY
HAZE pursued the pace while two wide, was urging eagerly on the the turn to be all out charge in the stretch then steadied in the final furlong and was
second best. PUDDING raced at the back of the pack while three wide, then bid from the inside leaving the turn but it was too little too late. CARBON
STRYKER chased the leader briefly from the inside then flattened out after the turn and needed rally. There was INQUIRY in regards to interference in the
late stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
PURE MALICE dueled for the lead from the inside, then vied briefly with two more rivals heading into the turn, disposed of said rivals, then continued to spar
with CAJUN WARRIOR at the top of the stretch before shaking clear and was kept to task till the end. AMERICAN ICON was nicely rated while three wide,
bid on the turn to rally in the late stretch and was up for the place position. CINCO MAJESTIC saved ground in the early furlongs, then came out three wide
leaving the bend to close willingly down the lane just missing the place prize. CAJUN WARRIOR dueled from the two path, was challenged by outer rivals
headed into the turn, then pulled away and continued to duel with PURE MALICE in the early stretch then gave way in the final yards.
DARYLSKLIMTOMANIAC pressed the pace while two wide, then settled back and was in a mild drive throughout the turn and into the stretch and lacked
rallying in the final yards. LUCKY APPEAL inched up while four wide to battle with inner rivals on the turn, was in a gamely rally, could not retain stride and
gave way in stretch. CASINO MO settled at the back of the field and was no threat. LEMON MERINGUE moved steadily down the backstretch while three
wide and attempted to over power the dueling leaders while in a hard drive heading into the turn, lacked the dominating bid and flattened out in the
remaining furlongs.

Footnotes
MATH MYSTERY tracked the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was in a steady hand ride throughout the turn, then closed fast down the line while
passing rivals and was up in the final strides. MISS DISTINCTIVE veered outwardly at the start, then tracked the pace while two wide, bid from the four path
on the turn, shifted inward, brushed rival, then continued to duel with the same rival in the early stretch then was surpassed by an outer rival in the end.
YOLANDA WHO chased the pace while three wide, was nicely rated before coming out four to five wide leaving the turn and closed well for the show prize.
TOOTIE chased the pace from the inside, was moving up on the turn to take over the lead at the quarterpole, was brushed at the top of the stretch, then
dueled from the inside before being out finished in the end. YVONNE'S MISS chased the pace while two wide, then swung six to seven wide leaving the
turn to rally mildly in the stretch and came up empty. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE pulled away from the pack to duel from the two path down the backstretch,
then gave way after the turn. POET LAUREATE was impeded at the start, then emerged to duel with an outer rival down the backstretch, gained command
briefly at the three eighths pole, then was overpowered on the turn and lost momentum. CARRY ON broke inwardly, was unhurried early and no threat.
GANGSTER RAP was no menace. ROSES ARE GRAY settled along the inside and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MAN showed the way into the first turn, was pressured by outer rivals in the early backstretch, continued to maintain the lead on the far turn
then drew clear in the late stretch while in a strong drive to prove best in the end. MINE THAT STAR tracked the pace from the inside in the early stages,
was in hard drive throughout the far turn, gained second position at the top of the stretch and was closing in on the leader in the end. ETHICAL
JUDGEMENT was unhurried early, saved ground down the backstretch and into the far turn, then rallied in the stretch and was only best for the show prize.
IT MAKES SENSE pressed the pace from the two path while in steady drive, then rallied gamely on the far turn in attempt to gain the lead, lacked the
winning bid and gave way in the home stretch. RUNWAY MAGIC tracked the pace while two wide down the backstretch, then bid on the far turn, came out
four wide and did not fire in the stretch. SILENCE D'ORO moved eagerly around the first turn while three wide to vie with inner rivals in the early
backstretch, was thru after the half and faded in the remaining furlongs.

continued to saved ground from the inside on the far turn, then rallied in the late stretch and was up for the show position. SHARP LORENZO led the way
from the inside to set the pace down the backstretch, was in a long drive leaving the far turn, then faltered in the stretch while steadying in the final yards.
NO TROUBLE chased the pace from the inside, settled back mid backstretch, continued to race at a moderate pace, then rallied at the top of the stretch,
was impeded by a drifting rival and stopped. LAST ATTACK chased the pace while two wide, then shifted out to the three path in the late backstretch to bid
on the far turn and came up flat in the stretch. SPONGE BATH stalked the pace while two wide, was in tight at the three eighths pole, steadied then gave

PRIZELESS stalked the pace from the inside while in a steady drive, took over at the quarter pole then drew off in the lane to prove best overall.
LANGUAGE BARRIER was well rated while four wide and outside of rivals, then rallied leaving the bend and closed well for the place position. LITTLE
AVENGER tracked the pace at an even pace throughout then menaced in the stretch and was able to get up for the show prize. SAINT PIO stalked the
pace from the two path then rallied in the stretch just missing the show prize in the end. MONET'S DEVIL was unhurried early, then rallied mildy in the
stretch to no avail in the end. SR. BI BI tucked along the inside and was no threat. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET led the way from the inside, was overtaken on
the turn then gave way in the lane. FLASHY BOY GOES stalked the lead briefly while three, then faded on the turn and lacked late bid. HARRY broke
awkwardly at the start and failed to contend.

eighth pole and held on to the end while in a strong drive. RECKLESS RED stalked the pace while two wide, then settled back on the turn, re bid in the
upper stretch to gain second position but could not catch the leader in time. CREDIT RATING raced at the back of the field while three wide, then came out
five wide leaving the turn and kept on down the lane and was up for the show prize. AMERICAN FOREST raced mid pack while three wide, then menaced
from the inside in the stretch and just missed the show prize in the end. BLINGO emerged to duel with an outer rival into the turn, inched clear of that one,
then dueled with another from the inside into the early stretch, was depleted and gave way in the end. HELLO HELLO MISTER led the pack while four wide
before dueling with an inner rival into the turn, could not retain stride and continued to press the pace then gave way in the late stretch. LUCKY PROMISE
moved up steadily to race mid pack while four wide, then bid leaving the bend and came up evenly in the stretch. HYPERION NORTH broke inwardly and
was no menace. SUMMER HELP was impeded at the start and was no threat. DOC'S BOLERO settled mid pack along the inside, urged eagerly on the turn
and did not spark in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLUE BOON tracked the pace from the inside while in a steady drive, then dug in gamely leaving the far turn and swept by the dueling rivals in the late
stretch and was up in time to prevail. OPTIMUS KAT sparred with MUFFIN NUTS throughout the first mile, was a long drive in the home stretch then was
surpassed by an BLUE BOON in the final furlong. MUFFIN NUTS dueled with OPTIMUS KAT throughout then was out finished by BLUE BOON in the final
yards and missed the place prize. GO SPEED RACER GO saved ground in the early furlongs, then moved up steadily while four wide on the far turn, and
closed willingly in the home stretch. MINT was bumped at the start, then was reserved at the pack of the pack, rallied from the inside leaving the far turn and
closed well despite prior circumstances. SPECIAL MOMENT was allowed to settle while two wide in the early furlongs, then rallied on the far turn and came
up flat in the stretch. HARD LOVE chased the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive on the far turn, bid in the upper stretch and needed more in the
end. VARNISHED drifted inwardly at the start and bumped rival and was no threat. COLOR FAST chased the pace while three to four wide down the
backstretch, was in a moderate pace throughout the far turn then lacked rallying in the stretch. EASTER SNAP pulled up in the early backstretch and was
vanned off.
