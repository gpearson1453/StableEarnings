Footnotes
STRIVE FOR STRIDE rated off the pace about the three path on the first turn, left the turn outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five
path on the far turn, was carried wider leaving the turn but dug in to reach even terms mid-stretch and dueled clear toward the wire. COLONIAL ROAD
saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, rounded the far turn near the rail and dueled to a slim lead past
the eighth pole, but was met mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. UNDERBOSS rated a slim lead off the rail, pulled clear leaving the three
eighths pole and entered the far turn off the rail, but bore out approaching the head of the lane and weakened. I'MLIVINGTHEDREAM raced off the rail the
opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then weakened toward mid-stretch.
MANHATTAN IMAGE had a brief early lead then raced with the pace in the three and four paths, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but faded in the
three path on the far turn. LORD ROCKINGHAM stalked inside on the first turn then faded readily through the backstretch.

Footnotes
CLEARLY VISIBLE rated the pace inside, was given rein entering the far turn and finished mostly of her own initiative. PRACTICALLY THERE angled to the
inside early on, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and settled for second best. TIMEISGOLDEN raced off
the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn two deep and ran evenly in the lane. JAMESTOWN ROAD stalked
inside on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole.
CALYPSO GHOST stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened in the lane. CASTLE
OF CAYLEE showed little response through the backstretch. SOMMER VELVET raced close in the four path the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole but weakened into the far turn.

SOUL CATCHER was reluctant to load then settled in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn about the four path, dug in for the lead past the eighth pole and inched clear later yards. CAFFEINENNICOTINE stalked off the rail, dueled to the front
at the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, was met past the eighth pole and relented later yards. MR. DUMBLEDORE saved ground well off
the early pace, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and dueled for
third. GIACOMO CASANOVA settled off the rail the opening turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and was
outfinished in the stretch duel for third. BORN TO SIN moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure and dueled from the three eighths pole,
raced close at the rail on the far turn but dropped back leaving the turn, flattened stride in the lane, pulled up lame on the clubhouse turn and was vanned
off. HURRICANE ALERT saved early ground and showed little response through the backstretch. DESTIN'S RAINBOW saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened into the far turn. DEFIANT GIANT settled back in the four path on the first turn and never factored.
COURT TUDOR raced in the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

in the six path on the far turn, took the lead passing the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and extended the advantage later yards. SAYYESTOTHELADY

the stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN settled in the three path the first turn, raced outside into the backstretch and
picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, remained close in the four path on the far turn but flattened stride mid-stretch. AIM'S JUBILEE rounded
the first turn in the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn, left the turn outside and weakened.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA CODE settled inside entering the first turn, started her bid leaving the nine sixteenths pole, closed to the heels of Lady Cinco De Mayo at the
rail approaching the eighth pole, angled three wide leaving the pole, dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear nearing the wire. LIAM'S KISS rounded
the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dueled
to a brief slim lead mid-stretch but was outfinished later yards. LADY CINCO DE MAYO took a quick lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came
under pressure nearing the quarter pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn and dueled at even terms through the upper stretch, but relented the
final sixteenth. LINDA'S TAJ stalked from the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, angled to the
four path leaving the turn but had little left. PAMZ PALACE raced well back in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out leaving the turn but showed little further. DASHING LASS raced in the five path the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the six path on the far turn. RIA FORMOSA saved ground.
