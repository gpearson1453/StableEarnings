Footnotes
CAJUN CATALINA led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. THAT'S MY MAMA raced off the
pace on the outside early, navigated the bend from the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. CANKTON'S COWGIRL
pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and chased on in the lane. ARMS APRIORITY chased the leaders
on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and kept on from there. DAISY DE ORO raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued
around the bend in the four path and finished evenly. BRIELLE EVANGELINE raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
bend and never threatened. ADEN'S RANSOM stalked the leader between horses through the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and
faded in the stretch. TARGET VISION tracked the leader on the outside early, continued around the turn in the four path and tired from there. RUN
NATALIE RUN trailed the field throughout, came around the turn in the three path, swung wide into the lane and was empty from there.

TOMMY SIX FINGERS chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. GRAN CHICO
hopped up leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack early, came around the bend in the four path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and
gained ground late. MEASURE OF FAITH raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn, began a
bid entering the stretch and gained ground late from there. POUND OUT A DEAL dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, continued to battle while
saving ground around the turn and gave way late. MACKAY BOY tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three
path and chased on to the wire. SENOR VEGAS raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and
finished evenly. COZY GEM raced off the pace on the inside through the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and passed tiring horses in the
stretch. INGLIS stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and faded in the lane. MY STORY raced off the
pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no bid. GUMBALL dueled on the outside early, continued to battle from the
