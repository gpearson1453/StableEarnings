TAKE CHARGE BABY moved three wide to challenge into the far turn, went clear then was roused briefly midstretch to win convincingly. THE BIGGER
BEAR stalked the pace from along the inside, could not go with the winner but was clearly best of the others. DIAMONDSFORAYBRIE dropped off the early
pace three wide, rallied four wide in the far turn and gained the show late. LADY MAZATLAN failed to mount a threatening bid while two or three wide. GO
LILLY GO showed the most speed to make the early pace about the two path and had little left nearing the lane. GOLDIES CLAIM followed the pace four
wide and weakened. EYE EYE BIRDIE was four and five wide in the first turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
MYSTERIOUS TALE dueled for the lead inside UNBOWED while out from the rail, moved to the three path into the lane and held that rival safe to the wire.
UNBOWED forced the pace outside the winner throughout and could not get by. WILD FIREMAKER was in reach of the top pair but lacked a final closing
bid. SISAWAY NOW was along the inside and could not threaten late. NIGHT TERROR lacked a rally three wide. STAR OF STARS was not a threat.
GIPSY CHIEF (GB) was not a factor.

four wide to bid into the far turn but could not get to the winner in the drive. WOKE JOKE moved in going to the far turn and made a mild late rally.
CARBONEL stalked the pace three wide, moved five wide into the lane and made a belated run. ALL LEGS prompted the pace inside the winner while out
from the rail and weakened in the drive. DRIVING stalked the pace from four wide and faded in the far turn. AUNT CARI failed to mount a bid four wide.

DOLLY DIMPLE stalked the pace three and four wide, bid into the lane and was slowly edging clear late. LOVENSEEK made the pace on a short lead about
the two path, resisted the winner into the lane but could not handle that one late. DILLON ROCKS dropped back outside, rallied five wide in the far turn and
was slowly closing late to gain the show. REVIVAL tracked the leader three wide and lacked a final closing run. MASTERPIECE DAY steadied along the rail
into the first turn, remained inside while with the lead group, was boxed inside rivals into the far turn and awaited room then went evenly in the lane.
LIBERTARIAN stalked the pace three or four wide and lacked a final closing run. WEBCAM weakened from three wide. R T'S IRON MAN was always back.

Footnotes
TENNESSEE MOON showed the most early speed to gain position about the two or three path, made all the running on a daylight lead, was roused into the
lane and held the margin under mild urging the remainder. ANGEL'S MELODY tracked the winner's pace from three wide and could not cut the margin while
clearly best of the others. P R ODDS SETTER with a rivals at the start, stalked the leaders in good position three wide but had no closing run. SING
CHARMER SING saved ground to the far turn, angled four wide into the lane and moved up but could not threaten. RIGHT OF REFUSAL tucked inside
going to the first turn, remained in reach but could not produce the needed late run. VIRTUALLY failed to mount a bid three wide. TRACK SMART stalked
the pace from along the inside and weakened. HOTASAPISTOL was bumped between rivals and squeezed back at the start and failed to threaten four
wide. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK stalked the pace from four wide and weakened. FOOLISH INTENT was bumped at the start and failed to threaten three wide.

Footnotes
WRATH tracked the pace four wide to bid into the far turn, edged clear and held safe under steady handling. OPTIMAL tracked the pace two or three wide
and could not get to the winner in the lane. DOGE OF VENICE saved ground and made a mild late bid. TOMBI was five wide into the lane to improve
position but just missed the show. PREACHER stalked the pace four wide and lacked a final closing bid. ROYAL CONSORT showed speed along the inside
and weakened. SEA FORCE was five and six wide in the first turn and never threatened. TIGER THE MAN was always back. LARCH was always back,
pulled up into the stretch and walked off. FAR FROM FINAL was far back, pulled up in the far turn and was vanned off.
