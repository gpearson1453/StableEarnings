Footnotes
SUNYANI battled for the lead with horses on each side down the backstretch, started to edge away from the early pace rivals at the three furlong pole,
opened up clearly by the quarter pole and had enough in reserve to hold safe at the wire. MIGHTY PELE was three deep outside prompting the pace along
the backside, chased the winner outside throughout the turn and continued to run on determinedly to best the rest at the finish. BILL NEEDLE was unhurried
to trail in the early going, began to pick up runners moving five wide outside foes at the quarter pole, was fanned out eight wide turning for home and
continued a good sustained run to get up for third money. CHUNKY MONKEY travelled between foes in mid-pack, continued to keep up through the turn,
was in the hunt in the five path for a piece of the prize at the top of the stretch and finished up evenly to settle on the fringes. BET N WIN was situated on
the fence stalking near the back, saved ground making little improvement on the turn and passed tired runners in the stretch. DANCIN' DEPUTY dueled for
the lead in the early going on the rail, gave way up top on the fence at the three furlong marker, kept pace with foes around the bend to be in the mix for a
small share straightening out, could not go on and faltered at the furlong marker. NOVA FOLHA tracked the front threesome while four deep outside rivals
down the backstretch, made a mild run going around four wide at the three eighths marker, shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane and had no run
to offer to the wire. READY ON THE LINE was reined back of the contesting trio down the backside, could not make any headway between runners through
the turn, swung seven wide at the top of the lane and emptied out on the drive.

Footnotes
ZONING ORDER travelled in midfield on the rail, had to be throttled down when stuck behind a tiring runner at the three eighths pole, finally had clear
running room shifting outside off the weakening rival at the quarter pole, was full of run inside down the stretch and was drawing away at the finish for the
score. CASTLETON was away alertly but broke out slightly on the start to lead early on, then was relegated to chase the frontrunner outside at the half,
continued to keep tabs on the pacesetter throughout the turn and courageously battled to the wire to get up for the runners up share. DESIGN DIVA tracked
on the outside four deep on the backside, ran four wide through the turn losing positions, re-rallied smartly in upper stretch and closed in under left handed
encouragement to nail third place at the wire. SMOKEN CHLOE settled in mid-pack between runners in the early stages, was scrubbed on starting to close
the gap on the leaders at the three furlong marker, battled down the lane while not switching leads to the wire and just missed getting show money in a
photo. MOET MONET emerged with a clear lead at the half inside, opened up while in hand around the oval, had a good lead at the top of the stretch,
began to get weary clinging onto the lead at the furlong pole and tired in deep stretch. WILD QUEENIE was void of early speed co-trailing on the inside in
the beginning, began to pick up runners at the quarter pole but could no be a factor in the running down the lane. GHOSTLY PERFECTION was brushed
inside on the break, co-trailed outside down the backstretch, offered a mild run five wide outside at the quarter pole and made little presence running to the
finish line. ALMONTE PRINCESS was part of the tracking foursome between runners in the two path down the back straight, was in tight mild checking out
of the pack inside the half mile marker, had a brief spurt four wide between foes at the quarter pole and weakened in the drive to the finish. FREED BY
MAGIC was in a good spot nestled on the rail watching the front pair, backed away on the fence through the field around the turn, was not persevered with
in through lane and galloped to the wire.

SPIRIT BEAR tracked the pacesetter down the backside, started to reel in the frontrunner by the quarter pole, took control outside with a furlong to run and
was kept to the task to the wire holding safe by a diminishing margin in the end. MIRAMICHI was under a snug hold in midfield, nearing the three furlong
marker was steadied behind horses, burst between foes in mid-turn, loomed four wide at the top of the lane but could not reel in the winner late. TAPROOM
had one beaten in the early stages, was unhurried seeing the field into the turn, started to rally three wide at the quarter pole, swung out widest with
momentum in the seven path turning for home and closed belatedly to be a non threatening third. SILENT PASSION was loose on the lead down the back
straight, continued unopposed up top around the bend, was collared outside by the winner with an eighth left to run, faded late but held on for a minor share
in the end. SOUL JOURNEY settled on the outside of runners in mid-pack, made little impression going four wide through the turn and finished up with
intent passing tired runners. PERSEVERATE tossed her head slightly on the break to trail, lacked running room at the three furlong pole, had clear running
room inside at the top of the lane but had no finish to give. PRINCESS O DENMARK stalked on the rail in the beginning, shifted outside off the rail by the
half, made a brief run with three eighths to go, could not find more in the stretch and stopped in the final furlong. VIRGINIA'S LEGACY chased the pace in
the early going, could not keep up with rivals on the turn and had nothing to show running on the fence in the stretch.

Footnotes
ECHO WITH LAUGHTER quickly moved to the lead, set the pace near the rail, spurted clear in upper stretch. JAMIESTA bumped with a rival at the start,
raced at the back outside runners, entered the turn four wide moving between, shifted out six wide by the end of that bend, kept on in the stretch to secure
the place while no threat to the winner. HIGHLAND SOCIETY was forwardly-positioned between runners then continued the pursuit solo racing three wide
on the turn, could not kick on with the top one and lost place late. KIDDIE HOLIDAY was in just a hair tight in the early going, shifted inside a foe at that
point and advanced inside early on the turn, moved out three wide coming to the quarter pole advancing between foes, kept on in the lane. GRAINGER
COUNTY got away alertly, ceded the lead content to stalk from outside and up close, went five wide on the turn, ran on evenly. KID FORESTER switched
out early racing off the inside and advancing between foes about two wide heading into the turn, fanned out four deep later on that bend in behind the
leaders and in range but evened out thereafter. SOLAR was off the pace five wide through the turn moving out a path or two for the drive, kept on
one-paced. BOXER BRIEF tucked in behind foes toward the back while outpaced early, raced three to four wide on the turn, failed to rally. KING ALFREDO
bumped with a foe at the break, moved forward early tracking inside, faded. MALIBU SECRET chased briefly four wide, was eased through the stretch,
crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT ARKLE settled nicely outside tracking the front duo down the backside, made a smart turn of foot three wide outside on the turn, moved to the
lead in the four path by mid-stretch and drew off when set down late. THREE SONNY SIDEUP was nestled on the rail in the middle of the pack, settled
inside on hold behind a runner going around the turn, finally shifted outside off that foe in the four path at the furlong pole and surged late to be the runner
up. JAY BIRD kept a close eye on the early pacesetter while tracking outside, chased the pace through the turn and stubbornly fought on between foes to
held for third money in the end. HARDWARE GAP tossed his head on the break spotting the field at the start, began to extend his stride passing foes
outside by mid-turn and continued the rally to the wire to be involved at the finish for a minor share. MIGHT BEE SPEEDY had a good position tracking on
the rail behind the top pair in the early stages, waited on the rail throughout the turn, had clear running room at the top of the lane, could not fire and was
one paced to the line. MO TOURIST ran between horses stalking near the rear down the back straight, was roused shifting out three wide at the quarter
pole but could not get into contention driving to the finish line. FOUR K FORCE was in tight soon after the break, made an early move three wide around
horses at the seven sixteenths marker, could not keep going in upper stretch and stalled in the final furlong. SILENT FORTUNE took command shortly after
the start, continued to dictate terms up front around the turn, was collared outside by the winner at the eighth pole and stopped quickly in the last sixteenth.
SUPER HEADLINE stalked near the rear three deep down the backside, could not accelerate with rivals throughout the turn and made little impression in
the stretch running.

Footnotes
PROMISING was bumped at the break, forwardly-placed between runners just off the leader, bid between foes coming to the quarter pole, dueled inside the
outside rival from that point to the sixteenth pole then edged clear. MAKE MAGIC was very reluctant to load, got away well with some coaxing and stalked
the pace from outside, bid three to four wide in tandem with the eventual winner nearing the quarter pole, dueled outside that foe to the sixteenth pole then
yielded grudgingly. CATCH THE DRIFT settled off the pace and racing in the four path on the turn, swung out seven wide for the drive, was gaining late but
missed place. PRINCESS JADE stalked from outside mid-pack going three to four wide on the turn and ran on evenly. SHAKSHUKA settled off the pace
and off the inside, came out further in the stretch and kicked on with mild late interest. WORSHIP broke outwardly bumping a rival, settled racing mid-pack
into the turn, went two to three wide between foes on that bend, ran on in the stretch. ECSTASY chased from inside, came out off the fence about the
quarter pole, ran on but needed more. PEGGY failed to threaten racing near but off the rail. HALEY'S HONOR moved clear soon after the start, set the pace
inside, faltered and faded. CALADIUM was outpaced and not a factor.

Footnotes
CRUMLIN LAD had a good position patiently waiting on the rail behind the engaged twosome, angled off the fence three wide with three furlongs to go
reeling in the leaders, pounced outside at the top of the stretch and kept on holding rivals at bay at the wire. FOREST BUZZ was in the tracking group
outside foes three deep, rallied four wide at the quarter pole, loomed the only threat straightening for home but was no match for the winner who had
something left late. WIN D'ORO was squeezed at the start, trailing the field, began to rally between runners at the quarter pole and found his best stride in
the stretch closing well to be third after the compromised beginning. NO MORE OPTIONS had rivals on either side tracking in the early going, made no
progress going around the turn, was asked right handed when behind foes at the top of the lane and mildly finished up to settle on the fringes. IT'S A FLUKE
prompted the pace outside down the backstretch, forced the pace outside the frontrunner on the turn, briefly poked his head in front turning for home and
yielded in the final few strides losing some positions late. MIGHTY SEA stalked outside foes near the rear, travelled three wide outside horses on the turn,
swung out for the drive widest in the six path but failed to menace to the wire. GOOD RAPPORT broke out to begin, stalked near the rear in the early
stages, saved ground but could not make any headway throughout the turn and could not be a factor in the run down the stretch. HE'S FULLY LOADED
broke outwards on the start, took this field down the backside, continued up front on the rail while hounded outside around the turn and was swallowed up
by the field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
CANDY OVERLOAD was allowed to settle into stride mid-pack, made a rapid advance inside rivals coming to the five-sixteenths, was guided out four wide
at the top of the stretch seeking room, split foes to bid nearing the eighth pole, dueled inside a rival before edging away from that one to prevail. FLAG OF
HONOUR (AUS) settled mid-division, advanced outside four then five wide midway on the turn, bid outside the eventual winner near the furlong grounds
with a real threat but was outfinished and only second best. IRONSTONE settled off the pace, saved some ground on the turn, rallied inside foes in
mid-stretch and was best of the rest. JAZZ HANDS was encouraged from the start and soon made the lead and moved clear, set the pace just off the rail,
came out a bit leaving the turn when challenged, was overtaken by mid-stretch and kept on evenly thereafter. ARMSTRONG was up close stalking the
pacesetter from outside, traveled three to four wide on the turn while dropping back off the leaders but kept on in the stretch. SKY'S NOT FALLING settled
off the pace racing between foes at the back, went three to four wide on the turn, needed more. ROCKCREST was in just a hair tight early, shifted in to track
the pace inside, moved out on the turn coming alongside the leader three wide at the quarter pole, floated five wide into upper stretch, flattened out. BIZ BIZ
BUZZ settled outside off the pace four to five wide through the turn, swung seven deep into upper stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
SOUPER CLASSY took control inside from the onset, opened up comfortably through the turn and had some in reserve to hold off the closing rivals in deep
stretch under a well rationed front end score. FOUR ACES HIGH had one foe beaten down the backstretch, began to pass runners travelling inside at the
quarter pole, rallied on the fence turning for home but could not gain on the winner who had some thing left. SOUPER SUCCESS had rivals on either side
tracking the front two in the beginning, closed the gap on the leaders gaining on the fence at the quarter pole to have a shot in the three path straightening
for the drive but needed more late running only evenly in deep stretch. SPITE STORE chased the frontrunning winner down the backside through the turn,
continued to battle on while in the thick of things three wide at the top of the lane and willingly finished up for a small share. READY FOR A FIGHT was
situated in the four path between horses tracking in the early stages, improved position smartly going into the bend, had a chance five wide for a share at
the top of the stretch but lacked a bid to pose a threat late. DOWNY BOY tracked outside five deep down the back straight, ran four wide around horses
keeping pace on the turn, swung out six wide for the drive but had little finish to offer to the wire. SILENT MIRACLE travelled on the rail in mid-pack, was
steadied sharply on the fence at the three furlong marker and could not recover to be a factor down the lane. LENNY K was void of early speed to trail down
the backside, could not gain on the turn and showed little throughout.

Footnotes
COLONEL MUSTARD settled in midfield between foes early, crept closer at the half getting better position into the turn, patiently sat measuring the leaders
on the turn, moved in when nudged on four wide at the top of the stretch and dueled to the sixteenth pole before edging away for the win. MUSICAL SPELL
reared at the break spotting the field, waited on the rail in last when the field bunched up at the quarter pole looking for running room, found a seam in the
five path with an eighth to go and burst between foes late to be the runner up with that gritty performance. WHERE IS ESSA was content to track the loose
pacesetter down the backstretch, began to edge closer two furlongs out, briefly had the lead turning for home but faded late saving for third money in the
end. AGILE DANCER stalked inside down the back straight, could not maintain position and was shuffled back some between foes on the turn looking for
running room, found a seam five wide at the top of the stretch and finished up mildly to the line. VALLEY VICTORY was hustled on the fence to get better
inside position in the backside, waited at the quarter pole with the field bunching up, had a clear lane in the two path turning for home but lacked a rally in
deep stretch. TOWN'S WARRIOR bobbled when entering the backstretch to stalk near the rear, was scrubbed on four wide at the quarter pole but was
making little gain and finished up with some run to pass weary foes to the wire. DREAM ON BABY travelled midfield outside of horses, offered a brief run
four wide at the quarter pole to be in with a chance for share at the top of the lane but gave way in the final eighth. SMART SKY stalked four deep outside
foes near the rear in the early going, tried to swoop around runners going six wide through the bend, angled out widest in the seven path turning for home
but was empty for the drive to the wire. SPIRIT OF SEATTLE broke alertly to take the field down the backstretch, was collared outside at the quarter poll
and retreated on the fence in the drive to the finish line.
