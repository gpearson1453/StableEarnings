Footnotes
SWAGGY GEORGE was hustled to a clear lead and soon had the inside, was then allowed to relax, challenged nearing the end of two furlongs, moved
ahead when let out some on the turn, put to urging in the lane, drifted out under left-handed pressure nearing the sixteenth marker, corrected and proved
much the best. BAM BAM CAM advanced from outside to threaten three wide on the bend, was no match for the winner when set down for the drive but
went unchallenged for second. MADE TO FIT raced in contention three or four wide for a half mile, lacked a serious stretch bid but held his show position.
JOEY B void of speed, though urged along, chased from inside, angled outside AFRICAN WARRIOR upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. FRONTANA was a step slow at the break, chased from just off the inside, angled out widest at the top of the lane and failed to have a
significant response. AFRICAN WARRIOR displayed brief speed just outside SWAGGY GEORGE then began to yield after three furlongs.

PALAGO soon shared the lead from outside, angled in beside BAILESTON LASSIE on the bend, battled that one in the lane, moved clear inside the last
eighth and maintained control. WITCHING rated from outside, advanced four wide on the turn, rallied to gain second inside the final furlong then could only
make up minor ground on the leader in the waning yards. BAILESTON LASSIE disputed the pace inside rivals, had the rail on the bend, fought in the stretch
but began to wear down inside the last furlong. NEXT TIME YOU WIN in contention early from inside, angled out for room leaving the turn, moved out five
wide at the top of the stretch and showed a willingness to run late. ABBMAR displayed early speed between horses, was three wide through the bend then
gradually weakened for the drive. HIDDEN FIGURE was boxed in through the turn and upper stretch then gave way the final sixteenth.

THINK BLUE was sent to vie for the early lead outside BETHY, moved clear two wide on the bend, floated out some for the stretch run and held sway under
steady urging. BETHY reluctant to load, disputed the pace between rivals on the backstretch, gained the rail on the turn, also floated out some into the lane
and began to level off inside the final furlong. DOROTA was checked behind THINK BLUE after travelling the first eighth, advanced three wide on the bend,
fanned outside the latter entering the lane, gradually drifted out, was straightened with a furlong left and made up minor ground on the top pair. SWEET
NELLIE prominent from inside, did not keep up while just off the rail on the turn, angled out to path four upper stretch and finished evenly. JULIAISON in
contention early, yielded along the rail through the turn and had no late bid. ORNERY ANGEL was a factor from outside on the backstretch, did not stay
close three wide on the bend, fanned out widest into the lane, gradually angled out as DOROTA came out upper stretch then angled in inside the last eighth
as she continued to fade.

ANGEL EXPRESS was quickly clear of the others, saved ground, under urging through the lane and kept MISS TENA MARIE at bay. MISS TENA MARIE
settled at the back, picked up her pace along the rail on the bend, swung out leaving the turn, lost ground fanning five wide entering the stretch, was all out,
came up short but proved clearly second best. BACKSTAGE BAMBI chased from just off the inside, angled out four wide through the turn, took over third
upper stretch then could only move clear for her position late. HER NAME WAS LOLA saved ground, waited for room on the bend, got through along the rail
into the stretch, moved clear for second but flattened out in the late going. HIGHTAILING IT hesitated then broke outward, advanced from outside, was
three wide leaving the turn then gave way for the stretch run. STARSOVERPARADISE forwardly placed between rivals, was two wide through the bend
then quickly retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
BUREAU in contention early, came off the rail midway on the backstretch, advanced two wide on the turn, split rivals four wide entering the lane, rallied to
gain the lead inside the last sixteenth and edged ahead late. GOLD SMOKE chased from inside, gradually angled out through the bend, came into the
stretch behind BUREAU, angled outside CHEEKERS with a furlong to go, rallied belatedly but caught LOOKIN FOR BALA for second. LOOKIN FOR BALA
soon shared the lead from inside, moved clear on the turn, lengthened command upper stretch but began to wear down inside the last eighth.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS soon trailed while running widest, lost considerable ground floating out to path seven into the stretch, made a strong move
outside rivals but was too late. CHEEKERS broke outward, was corrected and prominent from outside, progressed three wide on the bend, swung out to
path five entering the lane, edged ahead for second but leveled off in the late going. VIOLENZA D'ORO moved to the inside midway on the backstretch,
dropped back along the rail on the turn, regained a striking position with a furlong left but could not sustain his bid. ONE PUTT RICHIE disputed the pace
between horses, did not stay with LOOKIN FOR BALA on the turn and flattened out in the lane. FEVER NATION displayed early speed outside rivals,
stayed with ONE PUTT RICHIE through the bend then also flattened out for the drive.

Footnotes
FULL MAGAZINE moved to the inside with a half mile to go, waited for a wider opening along the rail on the turn, got through from inside at the quarter pole,
dueled in the lane, edged ahead inside the last eighth and held on under steady handling. DANZA TAXI was hustled along to set a pressured pace off the
rail but inside rivals, was challenged from outside on the bend, challenged, as well, from inside leaving the turn, floated out some entering the stretch, fought
gamely but had to settle for second best. SCHMOOZIN bumped just after the break, was settled outside, picked up his pace four wide on the turn, altered
out some to avoid ST. LOUIE LOUIE nearing the sixteenth marker and edged ahead for third in the waning yards. ST. LOUIE LOUIE bore in at the start,
bumping SHANGHAI POINT, pressed DANZA TAXI from just outside, went for the lead on the turn, began to wear down in the stretch, drifted out briefly
approaching the sixteenth pole and continued to slowly yield. LONESOME DREAM bumped SCHMOOZIN just after the start, chased from behind ST.
LOUIE LOUIE and gave way through the lane. SHANGHAI POINT also bumped at the break, raced in contention from inside on the backstretch, was just off
the rail taking the turn then also faded for the drive.

Footnotes
BLUE NEITH settled early, progressed two wide on the bend, fanned five wide into the lane, rallied to gain the advantage inside the final sixteenth and was
drawing off in the waning yards. CAT TALE BREEZE vied for the lead just outside HALLIE'S RAINBOW, did not stay with that one leaving the turn, came
again to edge ahead from between horses inside the last furlong, did not have enough to hold back BLUE NEITH deep stretch but was clearly second best.
SUNDAY SPEIGHT bore in at the start, raced in contention from just off the inside, retreated upper stretch, altered out four wide for a clear path with a
sixteenth left and caught HALLIE'S RAINBOW for third. HALLIE'S RAINBOW shared the lead from inside, moved clear leaving the turn, floated out some
entering the stretch and began to wear down inside the last furlong. LORI ATTACK pressed the pace from outside, came four wide into the lane and began
to yield. MISS MIA forced inward at the break, came into contention along the rail on the bend but flattened out the final eighth. SANGFROID was just off the
inside on the turn, angled out four wide upper stretch and had no late bid. CAMDEN'S BEAUTY forwardly placed while widest on the backstretch, faded
three wide on the bend.
