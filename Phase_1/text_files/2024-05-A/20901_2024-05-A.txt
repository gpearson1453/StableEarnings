Footnotes
VALIANT KISS stalked a three-way duel from the rail, came through inside of those foes turning for home, took the lead in upper stretch and edged ahead
under a drive. KIP THE DISTANCE dueled inside of two foes, drifted out turning for home, was collared in upper stretch but kept trying and held the place.
GRETA was reluctant to load, broke inwardly and slowly, raced greenly inside early, angled four wide early on the turn and rallied outside. POPSTYLE
bumped at the start, pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the stretch. CHINA BLUE failed to menace while racing three wide. MARABINA bumped
at the start, dueled between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired.

Footnotes
NIGHT JUMPER tracked in the five path, ranged up to bid under rousing from the three path midway around the far turn, took the lead passing the quarter,
inched clear in upper stretch, switched back to his left lead and began to shorten stride late, but held on. DANIEL SUN stalked in the four path, was cued
from the three path passing the three-eighths, swung from the five path into the lane, and ran on for place. KINGFISH STEVENS showed the way in the
three path, tipped to the rail under coaxing going into the far turn, lost the lead passing the quarter, but finished evenly down the lane to hold show. UNCLE
CURLY chased in the three path, was coaxed along the inside into the far turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, but made no impact. SIR TERRE
trailed in the two path early and never threatened. MOMZA raced off the pace in the four path but never menaced from the six path down the lane.

SUPER SPIN showed the way along the inside, floated out to the three path and received a right handed cue passing the three-eighths, was challenged by
an outer foe passing the quarter, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, dug in, and held off an inner foe thru the final furlong. EMILY'S ON FIRE
was prompted along from up close in the three path, driven along the rail around the turn, and ran on from the three path in the stretch fer place. WEST
BANK chased in the five path, ranged up under a ride to bid in the four path passing the quarter, but got carried out to the seven path at the top of the lane,
and finished evenly for show. DID I DAZZLE YOU slowly broke in at the start, tracked inside but made no impact on her left lead from the four path in the
stretch. LACE CURTAIN tracked in the two path, floated out to the five path around the turn, but never threatened in the eight path down the lane. TOO
HOT TO STOP raced off the pace in the six path but never menaced.

Footnotes
FORT CHARLES stalked the pace three wide, took over nearing the three-eighths pole, drew clear in the two path soon after and held firm under
right-handed urging. SIXTEEN CIGARETTES rated off the pace four wide, rallied outside and was clearly second best. HAY HAY HARRY pressed the pace
two wide between foes, could not match strides with the winner from the three-eighths marker but kept on for the show. CHACHARERO raced off the pace
three wide, angled widest in upper stretch and was no threat. MIDNIGHT ONYX set the pace along the rail, was collared nearing the three-eighths pole,
angled out in upper stretch and weakened. ANTILLEAN saved ground and failed to menace. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA chased the pace four wide and was
through after a half. SHIPWRECK was outrun inside. BALTIC MULE pulled up down the backstretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LADY O'BRIEN was keen to prompt the pace in the four path down the backstretch, bid in the three path passing the quarter, swung out to the five path at
the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. GOSSIPER tracked in the two path, came under a ride from the two path going into the far turn,
floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. MOBAY PRINCESS showed the way in the two path, was roused along the inside
midway around the far turn, fought on from the two path in upper stretch, but drifted out to the four path while losing the lead passing the eighth pole, and
evened out for show. TAKE YOUR POINT laid up close in the five path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, floated out to the eight path at the
top of the stretch, but was one paced. REINA MAR rated in the three path, was coaxed between foes into the far turn, but did not threaten. VERINA had a
slow start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LIVE HIGH LIVE LOW set the pace in the three path, was coaxed from the rail into the far turn, tipped back out to the three path at the top of the lane,
bumped with an outer foe twice while digging in going by the eighth pole, and inched clear late. SPEED CONTROL rated in the four path, was coaxed from
the five path into the far turn, swung from the seven path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. ICE THE KICKER prompted the pace in the four path,
bid in the three path midway around the far turn, was roused from the four path into the stretch, and kept on but bumped twice with the inner eventual winner
just after the eighth pole, and evened out late to show. EL CHATO stalked along the rail, was cued in the two path midway around the far turn, angled out
sharply and bumped an outer foe after the quarter, then tipped inside entering the stretch, and finished evenly. OLD FLAG (IRE) bumped between foes at
the start, chased in the four path, was ridden into the far turn, got bumped out to the six path by an inner foe turning into the lane, but hung on his left lead
and flattened. SILENT AND VIOLENT bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the four path, was driven in the six path around the far turn, fanned out
to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. POLIGLOTA raced off the pace in the three path but never threatened. BECAUSE THE
NIGHT bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was coaxed along in the four path around the far turn, but got bumped and had to
check after the quarter, then yielded.
