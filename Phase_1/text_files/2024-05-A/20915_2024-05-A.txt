DANCE FOR GREEN set the pace along the inner rail, opened up mid way on the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home and pulled away while kept to his
business. OPEN THE BOOKS saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail entering the stretch, altered course to the inside of PERSPICACIOUS BOY near
the eighth pole and rallied. BOLD HONOR , three deep around the turn, flattened out. PERSPICACIOUS BOY , fractious in the starting gate, hugged the
inner rail while chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and weakened. STORMY FIRE was outrun. HAP'S VICTORY showed speed
outside the winner and faltered entering the stretch.

PINOTSLILGIRL , away alertly, rated forwardly while saving ground, took closer order soon into the lane, altered out near the three sixteenths, moved up
outside PRINCESS PALMER soon after, wrested command leaving the eighth pole, switched over to her left lead after clearing then held firm while kept
alert. MELIPONINI BEE , bumped and squeezed back at the break, regrouped and settled outside a rival leaving the far turn, angled six wide into the lane
then closed gamely outside runners through the final furlong to gain the place. YOOOU KNOW , in range about two wide, eased out for the drive, advanced
between runners inside the furlong grounds, churned on but was out kicked for the place. PRINCESS PALMER broke outward and bumped a rival,
corrected and sped clear, set a rated pace around the turn, responded when asked two wide in upper stretch, yielded to the winner leaving mid stretch and
weakened late. GIRLS HOUSE , four wide outside foes, took closer order past the three eighths, chased between runners leaving mid stretch then finished
evenly. TAK E LADY , bumped at the start, edged up into the turn and prompted the pace outside PRINCESS PALMER, failed to kick on past the furlong
grounds and weakened. LA TACHE drifted in at the break and made contact with the runner up, was taken to rated off the pace while saving ground,
continued inside in the drive and had belated action. FASHIONISTA , towards the inside, came up empty. MISS FOXANN , brushed at the break, raced
between runners early while not far back, steadied back off foes entering the turn, angled out to give wide pursuit then faded.

Footnotes
MYSISTERNANCY broke outward then was corrected and cruised clear leaving the chute, dictated the pace around the turn, entered the lane around three
wide, responded to firm encouragement and held sway. LUCKY LORRAINE stalked the winner three wide, shifted out wider while under a ride into the lane,
straightened away and closed willingly to bridge the gap. SWEET HEIDELBERG bobbled at the break, recovered and led early, ceded to the winner while
wrangled back leaving the chute and heading to the three quarter pole, moved out and stalked off the inside, was getting out nearing the lane and came up
empty. GOLD TIME VIXEN , off the rail, failed to respond. KEEN CONTENDER , sluggish from the gate, lagged well back, was under a ride mid turn, came
three wide into the stretch but failed to generate a run.

FAITH AND LIBERTY broke alertly, angled in mid way down the backstretch, set the pace slightly off the rail and was under urging in the drive. SIPPIN'
TIME raced in the four path between horses leaving the backstretch, was outside foes turning for home and rallied. SKIP THRU DA FIRE , five deep leaving
the backstretch, remained wide on the turn and failed to menace. ANY FOOLS GOLD showed speed along the inner rail, eased off the rail turning for home,
chased the winner and weakened. CONFLUENCE LASSIE stayed along the inner rail most of the race and was not a factor. PUT A ROCK ON IT raced in
the three path on the turn and was no factor. TIA MAYIN , outrun, stayed near the inner rail most of the trip. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS , caught in traffic between
horses leaving the backstretch, drifted wide turning for home and was eased late.

Footnotes
WORKIN ON A DREAM , eagerly to the front, was joined from his outside heading to the three quarter pole and vied in hand, pulled his way clear leaving
the half mile marker, opened up past the three eighths, was under a drive in mid stretch then continued to widen while steadily hand ridden the final seventy
yards. ALBERTANO bore out at the break bumping a rival, corrected and edged up outside rivals in the opening quarter mile, circled four wide with pursuit
into the lane, kept on grinding to earn the place. PORCH SWING moved up between foes leaving the chute and engaged the winner from his outside, vied
on a slim advantage past the five eighths, could not match strides leaving the far turn, stayed on to chase three wide into the stretch, raced between runners
nearing mid stretch and kept on with effort. HANALEI'S HOUDINI settled outside rivals early then dropped in advancing towards the five eighths, moved up
between runners mid turn, secured the inside for the drive but came up empty in late stretch. ROCKY DICE , bumped at the break, regrouped and settled off
the pace, saved ground in the lane and passed faders. IRISH RIVIERA , bumped and pinched back at the break, was urged off the rail mid turn and lacked
a rally. SPECTRIER edged up leaving the chute and tracked the leaders from the inside, was under a hearty ride mid turn, failed to kick on and retreated
through the lane. KRUG , three deep with the early pace, gave chase between runners past the three eighths and gave way. DISPUTED NOTION settled off
the pace, gained towards the inner rail leaving the half mile marker, swung five wide into the stretch, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and
weakened.

Footnotes
IMAGINETHEODDS prompted the pace outside KAKE'S TAP DANCER, took the lead near the five eighths pole, opened up in the stretch and dug in
tenaciously to last. ACTIVE , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, was well placed turning for home and closed late outside the
winner. DARK POOL , between horses leaving the backstretch, was three wide leaving the far turn, rallied outside and brushed with KAKE'S TAP DANCER
in deep stretch. KAKE'S TAP DANCER showed speed along the inner, briefly steadied entering the far turn, angled out in the stretch and brushed with
DARK POOL late. QUEEN OF THE DANCE stalked the pace racing along the inner rail down the backstretch, was held up a bit leaving the far turn,
remained inside horses turning for home, swung out in mid stretch and failed to rally. COMPASS RISES lacked speed and was no factor. COACH CALEY
(IRE) advanced four deep on the far turn then weakened in the drive. ARROGATES DREAM hugged the inner rail on the far turn and was not a factor.
LOVE SAGA swung to the five path in upper stretch and came up empty. INTRO trailed.

Footnotes
KILO ROAD took over early towards the inner rail and handled pressure from two outer rivals, spurted clear under rating leaving the far turn, responded
when set down entering the lane, opened up under stout asking in mid stretch, drifted out a bit, corrected and was throttled down through the final seventy
yards. SPIRIT AND TRUTH broke inward, straightened and edged up while saving ground nearing the half, sat patiently mid turn, eased out for room near
the quarter pole, straightened away to give game chase but was no match for the winner. LADY LEMONCELLO rated outside a rival while within range near
the three eighths, angled out then circled five wide into the lane, made a run in mid stretch then flattened out late. GETTOTHSTORYIMDONE was sent up
between rivals to entertain the early pace, chased three wide past the five sixteenths and into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded.
MISS AMAZING broke slowly, recovered and moved up outside a foe into the turn, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, swung well wide but
needed more. MATTIE , off the slowly, was rated towards the inner rail, moved up some mid turn, stayed inside for the drive but came up empty. LEGEND
OF LIGHT , three deep contesting the early pace, forced the issue four wide past the five sixteenths, lacked a kick entering the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
OUR STRONG VOWS saved ground around the turn stalking the pace in hand, eased out to the three path in mid stretch, closed outside DULCE KIARA
and was up approaching the finish. DULCE KIARA bumped with BOUND BY DESTINY at the start, prompted the pace in hand around the turn and in upper
stretch, gained the lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. SISTER SUPREAM set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way the final
furlong. BOUND BY DESTINY bumped with DULCE KIARA leaving the starting gate, chased the early pace, was shuffled back entering the turn then
showed a late move. ISABELLA'S GLORY was no factor. PRINCESS JAVONCIA , well placed in the two path on the turn, gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAVENDISH , four wide to contention, prompted the pace in hand and to the outside of RETURN FIRE, drew alongside into the far turn, dueled under some
rating past the three eighths, moved clear when asked into the lane, wandered outward past the three sixteenths, corrected with right handed asks, drifted
out late but was clearly best under a drive. GENERAL J R settled well back while saving ground, commenced a run past the five sixteenths, eased out into
the lane, kept on grinding and nabbed the place to the inside of RUDY RUDY RUDY. RUDY RUDY RUDY , well placed inside, eased out when moving up
into the stretch, drifted a bit, corrected and kept on gamely. COMMON PROSPERITY , three to four wide, circled under a ride into the stretch, raced on his
left lead, failed to respond and faded in the final furlong. CORONATION TIME broke a step slow, angled in around the first turn, moved up behind rivals
leaving the five eighths, came under a ride past the three eighths and weakened. RETURN FIRE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, met an
outside bid from the winner after a half, dueled under a ride past the three eighths, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. SELASSIE , urged off
the inside, faltered.
