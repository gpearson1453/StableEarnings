Footnotes
UNCLE WATER FLOW well placed behind the dueling leaders, bid to the front in the stretch and drew clear while being shown the whip. WHISKEY PRIZE
alternated for the lead along the rail, collared again and continued gamely. MAJOR CAM vied outside, led briefly on the final turn then proved empty in the
stretch. SMARTEN UP lagged far behind then offered some late energy wide. IMAGINE THIS dropped back in the two path then passed rivals without
menacing. HE'S ON FIRE offered brief bid inside on the final turn then faltered. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT saved ground off the leaders and gave way
readily. FOOD FOODIE lacked speed and was never in contention. LONG LIVE NOW chased wide, lost contact with his field and was eased late. PER
RULING #ECM2024-164 FROM HIWU, UNCLE WATER FLOW WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

FAST BOB dropped back outside, advanced very wide on the turn and into stretch, offered a late surge and was just up. MY DEVILS CHILD rallied four
wide into the stretch, led to the final yards and was nailed. BAAFEED prompted the pace outside, battled throughout but was outfinished. SOUPER FLY
OVER outrun early, advanced inside, loomed a stretch threat but flattened out. DIVINE MIRACLE lacked speed, saved ground throughout with a mild rally.
AHSAD set a pressured pace inside, vied to the stretch, steadied briefly tiring at the top of the stretch. SMART AND FAST flashed speed in the opening
quarter then stopped abruptly. BIG JOHN lagged far behind and trailed throughout. The stewards posted an inquiry into the top of the stretch and the rider of
AHSAD claimed foul against the third and fourth finishers but the result was allowed to stand.
