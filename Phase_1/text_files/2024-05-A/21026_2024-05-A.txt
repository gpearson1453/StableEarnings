PISCO away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing covered up at the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn
while awaiting room, split rivals three wide entering he lane, assumed command in deep stretch and inched clear to prove best. BAKBURNER broke sharply
and dueled for the lead from the outside of HARTLEY MANOR entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of her stablemate in
the run down the backstretch, assumed command leaving the turn, but was unable to fend off PISCO in deep stretch while holding on for the place. OUR
BLOKE stalked the leaders while trailing the compact field into the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted four
wide entering the lane, and closed with late interest. FRASER LANDING tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
rallied three wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the lane. HARTLEY MANOR away alertly and vied for the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BAKBURNER in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded in the
stretch drive.

TEXAS MOONSHINE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch,
turned back a bid by ROLLIE'S SPIRIT, and drew clear in the lane as much the best. ROLLIE'S SPIRIT away well and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, pressed the pacesetter two wide entering the final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival entering the
lane, but battled gamely to hold the place. CHAMPIOSA tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied smartly
along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to just miss the place. THERE GOES MY HERO away alertly and stalked the leader
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon.
CRYPTO MUNNY settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, continued to save ground entering the final
turn, but lacked the needed response when called upon.

Footnotes
JERSEYS IMAGE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BACK SHACK in the
run down the backside and through the final turn, took control entering the lane and quickly drew clear. BAK TO LIBERTY stalked the contested pace while
saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to get up
for the place. BACK SHACK was unprepared at the start, rushed up to force the issue two wide entering the backstretch, continued to press the pacesetter
two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. DON W settled off the early pace while racing three out from the rail,
advanced from the outside midway down the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon. BARBERRY BANDIT away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied along the inside
through the final turn, and finished evenly in the stretch drive. GROOVIN' IS BAK away well and stalked the early pace while racing three wide entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. Following the running of this race the stewards conducted an inquiry into
the start. After review it was determined that BACK SHACK did not receive a fair start, and ordered a full refund on this horse, and deemed that BACK
SHACK raced for purse money only.

SOMTHING ELUSIVE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter from along the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly through the final turn while
continuing to save ground, slipped through at the rail entering the lane to assume command, and held KNOPFLER safely at bay late. KNOPFLER away well
and stalked the early pace while racing two wide entering the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed best of all late to get
up for the place. QUAGMIRE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide through the final
turn, and finished evenly in the lane to garner a share. LEFT THE BAR raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, raced one out from the rail through the turn, but was outfinished late. MORETHANSOULTITLE tracked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while finishing five wide in the
drive. DEALERS HAND settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backstretch, continued to save ground through the final
turn, but failed to make a late impact. RING OF KERRY unhurried early while trailing the field in the run down the backstretch, saved ground through the
final turn, and finished with late interest while unable to mount a serious late bid.

AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
opened a clear lead in the run to the final turn, and held GOOD BYE PUTIN safely at bay late to prevail. GOOD BYE PUTIN lagged well off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail entering he backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside entering the final turn while awaiting racing room, slipped
through at the rail leaving the turn, and closed determinedly to just miss. FRANKIE MACHINE broke sharply and stalked the pacesetter in the run down the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, mounted a three wide bid entering the final turn, and closed willingly two out from the rail in the lane in an
even effort. DYNAMITER tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished one
out from the rail in the drive. BARNEY GOOGLE unhurried early while dropping back to trail in the run to the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack
in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with late interest from along the inside in the drive. JUVEE TOO away well
and stalked the early pacesetter while racing three out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but needed more late.
VANCOUVER'S HUNTER settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn,
and was never a factor.
