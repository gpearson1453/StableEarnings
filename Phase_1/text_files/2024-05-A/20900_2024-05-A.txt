Footnotes
WHITE ICE unhurried for the early going to be near the rear of the field, commenced a rally entering the final turn to steadily advance through the field
engaging the leaders turning for home and pulled clear midway down the lane holding sway at the wire. REGATTA BAY reserved off the pace for the first
five-eighths and mounted a strong belated rally down the stretch to be second best. CONTRABAND EARLY stalked the pace down the backside, rallied on
the turn to take the lead nearing the quarter pole and was outkciked in the stretch. MISTERHOLYROLLER slow early to be at the back of the field, made a
middle move to loom boldly turning for home and flattened out in the lane. ONE MORE SLEEP tracked the leaders from a striking position to be well placed
at the head of the lane and weakened coming home. RED ROCK SOLUTION went evenly without impact. CATCH ME T pressed the pace early on and
faded approacing the final turn. B D ENVISIONIST broke slowly and was never a threat. STYLING HOOK sped to the lead under pressure for a half mile
and gave way.

HARPES HILL set a pressured pace to upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up losing the lead in mid-stretch and came on again in a determined drive.
MATZOH BALL broke alertly, settled into a pressing position through the turn, rallied to engage the leader in upper stretch, briefly took the lead in the lane
and was out-finished in deep stretch while clearly second best in a good effort. FLAT OUT RUNNER tracked the leaders in the turn and finished willingly to
be along for the show. FREE FROM GUILT showed speed early and faded on the turn. JOSEPH H was not a factor.

MAHOMEBRED took command shortly away from the gate, set a comfortable pace while well in hand, opened up midway on the turn and finished willingly
holding the runner-up safe at the wire. ORDER UP stalked the pacesetter through the turn, rallied six wide at the top of the lane, loomed midway down the
stretch but could not get passed the winner. SKIPPA tracked the leader from striking distance to the head of the stretch and rallied mildly to gain the show.
HEZA SEXY ZONG reserved off the pace after breaking well and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. HUFFS TAZ A BOO trailed most of the way and was
never a threat. ARKANSAS ZONG prompted the pace to midway on the turn and weakened coming home.

DONEGAL FACTOR took command into the first turn, opened a clear, well rated lead down the backside, responded when called upon turning for home
and was never threatened as much best and geared down nearing the wire. DON'T BOX ME IN stalked the pacesetter throughout, could not gain ground on
that one and kept on well to be second best. TOUCHDOWN JOE chased the top pair to no avail lacking a closing rally. MR. TIN MAN dropped back to the
rear of the field approaching the far turn and finished as a non-factor.

Footnotes
CHARLI MICHAEL vied for the lead from the two path, set the pace to his liking, stayed in front through out and finished as an uncontested wire to wire
winner. BONUS APPRECIATION raced from off of the pace in the four path, was allowed to settle, tracked off of the pace for the first half, was given the cue
at the half mile pole and responded well closing along the out side, found his best stride late in the stretch and cleared every one except for the winner, he
could not run Charli Michael down but was second best today. BARAHIN vied for the lead, stalked the leader, maintained a forwardly placed position in the
two path through out, was caught late by a fast closing rival and had to settle for third place. MCLEAN stalked the pace setter from the inside, continued to
track in that position, then faded late. LOUD MOUTH showed little. CALLINGINTHENIGHT mid pack, no impact. BIRTHDAY PARTY never involved.
TAPPIN FORA DANCE trailed through out.

Footnotes
TITANIUM DEAL broke alertly, was taken in hand to be well off the pace, made a steady advance on the turn, rallied from seven wide in upper stretch to
engage the leader inside the eighth pole and wore that one down to prevail in deep stretch. PENNYS DEAL pressed the pace from the gate to the quarter
pole, assumed command turning for home, responded when challenged by the winner, dueled through the lane and was out-finished in deep stretch in a
game effort. NAVARRIAN tracked the leaders to be well placed at the head of the stretch and mounted a mild non-threatening bid to gain the show.
TAUREAN slow early to be the trailer and mounted a good belated closing rally in the lane. FRAN'S STAR raced mid-pack from four wide throughout failing
to mount a closing bid. RUNNER RUNNER raced near the back of the pack and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. DADDY'S FINEST set a pressured pace
from the rail to the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. GUS'S DREAM WORLD chased the leaders for a half mile and flattened out. HABANERO TOM
reserved off the pace along the fence saving ground to no avail and tired through the stretch run.

ENTITLEMENT reserved off the pace at the back of the main pack, commenced a six wide rally midway on the turn to circle the field, quickly took command
turning for home, opening a clear lead in upper stretch and held well down the lane. TOMMIE G reserved off the pace racing two wide behind the front flight,
split rivals at the top of the stretch and closed well while unable to gain on the winner but finishing well clear of the rest. PIP SQUEEK prompted the pace
through the turn to be well placed turning for home and lacked a closing bid. SIKARA SIKARA trackked the leaders from five wide through the turn and
failed to respond when called upon for the drive. WORLD OF HURT slow early to be well out the back of the field through the turn and passed tiring rivals in
the lane. DOLLY'S GUITAR stalked the leaders to the quarter pole and flattened out down the lane. SUMMERTIME BANDIT sped to the lead setting a
pressured quick pace and gave way coming home.

Footnotes
IMPERATOR FURIOSA sped to the lead shortly from the gate, opened a wide advantage on the turn and held on through the lane while tiring. LINDA FAYE
unhurried for the early going to trail the main body of the field, saved ground cutting the corner turning for home, angled out in upper stretch and was gaining
belatedly. COSTA LADY tracked the pacesetter to the turn, rallied up the fence on the bend and finished evenly down the stretch. LAST PENALTY rated in
mid-pack throughout and lacked a closing rally when called upon. GRACE'S VISION chased the pace from three wide through the turn and flattened out
coming home. ABBEY CAKES hustled to keep pace down the backstretch and faded midway on the turn. SPICY BROADWAY hesitated at the start, slowly
galloped out of stalls, showed no interest, galloped home and walked off.
