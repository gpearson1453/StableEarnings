Footnotes
PARK PLACE set the pace near the inner rail, turned back a challenge in mid stretch and drew off. WIN NO JOKE chased the pace, challenged for the lead
outside the winner in mid stretch and flattened out. BOX N BEN , bumped at the start, checked in tight quarters along the rail entering the turn, remained
along the rail on the turn and in the stretch and rallied. SINCERITO , bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and lacked a rally.
WEMBY , four deep around the turn, was not a factor. HAMPDEN LANE raced inside horses on the turn and gave way entering the stretch. DUCKPINS
bumped BOX N BEN when drifting out leaving the starting gate and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
DUELA DENT gained a slim lead early and dueled to the inside of GLAMOROUS while under rating, remained in a battle with that one into the stretch,
shook clear under stout right handed asks in mid stretch, widened a bit nearing the sixteenth pole then was fully extended to prevail. ENKINDLE , away well,
dropped in and pulled her way forward to track the dueling leaders, saw those two get away a bit leaving the far turn, was under a hearty ride to hold
position into the stretch, remained inside for the drive and came back on in game fashion. JOB'S NOT FINISHED , forwardly placed, steadied off heels
nearing the half, regrouped to stalk three wide outside ENKNDLE past the five sixteenths, shifted further out in upper stretch and closed willingly.
GLAMOROUS , away alertly, engaged the winner from her outside early on, stayed latched on to that one around the turn and into the lane, failed to match
strides near mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MINIME hopped then ducked in at the break, corrected and saved ground, remained towards the inside
through the lane and churned on. HOT DANCE rated off the early pace while outside a rival, angled five wide under a ride into the lane but failed to
generate a serious run. MUSIC ON THE ROCKS , in range three wide early on, dropped back and angled in around the turn then came up empty through
the stretch run. SWEET HONEY BEE , a bit sluggish from the gate, lagged back, raced three wide mid turn and failed to respond.

far turn four wide and rallied late. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , angled in early, stayed along the inner rail on both turns, altered course to the four path approaching the
eighth pole, rallied mildly and switched to his left lead late. URBAN MYTH , swung out leaving the first turn, advanced in the three path on the far turn and
gave way through the stretch. INVECTIVE chased the pace outside the winner, faltered in upper stretch and was eased.

around the far turn, dueled four wide outside rivals in upper stretch, gained a slim lead battling outside FORMAL AFFAIR in mid stretch, shook clear in deep
stretch and was fully extended to prevail. RAINY SKIES edged up to the inside of foes to contest the pace into the first turn, rated off FORMAL AFFAIR after
that one cleared, saved ground stalking through the backstretch run, swung out four wide leaving the far turn, gave hard chase of the dueling trio while five
wide into the lane, finished up gamely and gained the place late. FORMAL AFFAIR , bumped early then was eager when clearing near the seven eighths,
dropped in to set the pace, was joined by a pair of outer rivals leaving the far turn, dueled to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. IN THE DANCE , four
wide through the backstretch, raced three wide into the lane then offered a mild kick. MINXZLUCKYSTARFYRE was steadied around the first turn, saved
ground under a ride leaving the far turn, stayed towards the inside in the drive and churned on. CAP COM , bumped with a rival heading to the first turn,
eased out and moved up to stalk, bid two wide and between runners into the far turn, fought on past the three sixteenths then weakened.

Footnotes
K KAKE POP sprinted to the early lead, stayed along the inner rail setting a pressured pace to upper stretch then drew off under energetic urging. LEGEND
OF LIGHT prompted the pace outside the winner, was no match for that one in the drive and held the place while switching to her left lead near the sixteenth
pole. T C NEIGH chased the pace, was three wide leaving the turn and weakened. QUALITY WEEKEND , four wide turning for home, failed to be a factor
and lugged in near the eighth pole. CHALICE bobbled at the break, saved ground on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and retreated. GANBATTE ,
no factor, raced along the inner rail on the turn. SALLY GIRL bore out at the start and was outrun.

Footnotes
CUT FROM CLASS sped clear early, rated kindly while towards the inner rail, responded to coaxing and kept oncoming rivals at bay leaving the five
sixteenths, spurted away under a stout drive past mid stretch, drifted out late and held firm. GOLDEN CHARM rated outside a rival early on, angled out
advancing past the half, chased outside BROOKLYN GAL into the lane, wandered out leaving mid stretch, corrected with right handed rousing and saved
the place. BROOKLYN GIRL , four wide the first turn, stalked three wide outside VODKATINI past the five eighths, took aim leaving the three eighths, failed
to quicken the with top pair soon into the lane, altered out for the final furlong and came back on. COVER THE SPREAD settled off the pace while saving
some ground, angled out near the far turn but failed to rally. VODKATINI stalked two wide and to the inside of BROOKLYN GIRL, failed to go on under
pressure while saving ground past the three eighths and tired.

Footnotes
NEXT GIRL lacked speed, advanced four deep on the far turn, secured command in upper stretch, was under urging in the drive and eagerly pulled away.
OH MRS. MAISEL , bumped and forced out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace, advanced in the three patch on the far turn, challenged for the lead
inside the winner turning for home and weakened. CATCH THE KITTEN bumped OH MRS. MAISEL when bearing out at the start, raced inside horses,
finished willingly and altered course late. SOLVING PROGRESS showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. TWO MINUTE LICK was
never a factor. NAMI had speed outside SOLVIING PROGRESS, faltered and was eased. OREO ANGEL , reluctant to load into the starting gate, broke
awkwardly, lost ground both turns and weakened.
