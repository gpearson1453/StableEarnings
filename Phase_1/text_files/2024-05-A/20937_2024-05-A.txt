RACING RIVER broke sharply and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace while racing out from the rail in the run
down the backstretch, got the better of his pace rival leaving the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled at the back of
a compact field while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, advanced from between rival midway down the backside, rallied smartly from
along the rail through the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. READY HERO stalked the early pace while racing two
out from the rail in the run down the backside, raced in a tracking position in the run to the final turn, rallied two out from the rail entering the turn, but lacked
the needed closing response when called upon. COBRA JET away well and forced the issue entering the backstretch from the outside of RACING RIVER,
continued to chase that rival into the final turn, struggled to keep tabs on that foe leaving the turn, and was outfinished late. COUNTRY COWBOY away
alertly and tracked the leaders into the first turn while racing just out from the rail, held a striking position in the run down the backside, but began to weaken
approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

WICKED NIGHT away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a contested pace from the inside of SLOOP JOHN B in the
run down the backside, proved too much for his pace rival entering the turn, and drew clear in the late going. PRINCE CAIRO bumped repeatedly in the
opening strides, before steadying off heels passing the wire the first time, held a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, saved ground while
commencing his bid through the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove second best. LOGICAL AL settled at the back of the pack while
racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, mounted a three wide bid entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the
drive to get up for a share. SLOOP JOHN B away alertly and pressed the pace from the outside of WICKED NIGHT in the run down the backstretch,
struggled to keep pace with that rival leaving the final turn, and faded in the late stages. ACCORDINGLY was fractious prior to the start, but broke sharply
and tracked the leaders into the first turn while racing just out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backside while racing two out from
the rail, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's
claim of foul. The rider of PRINCE CAIRO lodged a claim of foul against the rider if WICKED NIGHT for alleged interference in the run to the first turn. After
review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish.

HOAX away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch, maintained her

the place. LICORICE broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing to the outside of HOAX, forced the issue two wide in the run to the
final turn, was unable to match strides with that rival through the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. EBONY EYES unhurried early

B C CHRISTIE away well and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but faded in the late

Footnotes
ARIKARA away alertly and vied for the lead from the inside of BAKZONE entering the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, took control in the run
to the final turn, widened her advantage through the turn and was never seriously challenged late while under confident handling. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY
steadied briefly from between rivals in the run to the first turn, stalked the leaders three wide entering the backstretch, began to advance midway to the final
turn, rallied two out from the rail through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive to hold the place. AMANDA settled well off the contested early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, mounted a two wide bid entering he final turn, and finished willingly two wide in the drive to get up
for a share. ICE BREAKER broke sharply, but was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid one out from the
rail entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive. TEXAS HUMOR settled off the early pace while racing three wide entering backstretch, rallied
two out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive. WALKINTHEWALK unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the
backstretch, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. BAKZONE dueled three wide for the lead from the
outside of ARIKARA in the run down the backside, was unable to keep pace with that rival approaching the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.
STAR FINALITY away well and tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, but faded over the final furlong.
