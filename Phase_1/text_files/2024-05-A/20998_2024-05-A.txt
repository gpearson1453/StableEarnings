Footnotes
DEE'S LEGS rated along off the top pair, made a three wide bid to take command near the quarter pole and drew off through the drive to be clear under
steady handling. RENATI tracked the early leader, challenged just off the inside near the three eighths pole to narrowly take the lead but was no match for
the winner in the drive. BAD BRAD showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside and weakened off the top pair through the drive. TIZNOW TOM
void of early speed, lost ground to race far back and never threaten. BOLIE was pulled up near the half mile pole and had to be vanned off.

Footnotes
FOREIGN TOURIST tracked the early leader, dueled two deep from the outside of Rust's Sunrise, dug in three to four deep through the stretch drive and
prevailed under all out pressure. RUSTY'S SUNRISE quick to begin to set the early pace, dueled through the far turn near the rail, dug in late while
continuing its inside run and kept on gamely to the wire. Jockey of Rust's Sunrise claimed objection for interference against the winner through the stretch
run and stewards ruled no change. DOMINA rated along between rivals down the backstretch, loomed three wide near the quarter pole, raced from the
outside of rivals in the stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. SUENA dropped back early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and had no late
response. LA LOMBRIZ stalked three to four wide from the outside and stopped. JONESBOROHURRICANE rated along the inside and was done early.
