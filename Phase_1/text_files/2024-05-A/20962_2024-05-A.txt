Footnotes
GETAWAY CHARM prominent away from the start, stalked the early pace along the first turn, went up and contested the moderate pace into the
backstretch run, dueled TIGERIZE into the second turn and took a slim lead while two to three wide at the quarter marker, shook free of TIGERIZE nearing
the furlong pole, was kept to task under steady urging into the final sixteenth and drew clear in deep stretch. TIGERIZE broke out some at the start and
bothered a neighboring rival, assumed early command and dictated terms into the first turn, was joined by GETAWAY CHARM into the backstretch run and
set a contested pace nearing the half-mile marker, dueled GETAWAY CHARM into the far turn, lost ground to that rival into the stretch, could not match
strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. HARBOR DEAREST forwardly placed in the early running, tracked the pace three wide
into the first turn and was a bit keen into the backstretch run, settled and tracked the modest pace outside of an inner rival approaching the half-mile marker,
chased two wide into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and stayed on in the late stages to secure third. NO BEACHES bobbled at the start and was off
a bit slowly, was allowed to settle in the early running, saved ground into the far turn, ran a bit erratically through the lane and could not muster a late
response. BLUE BREEZE tracked the modest pace from the inside, saved ground while well placed through the backstretch run, maintained an inside path
into the second turn, chased into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PRETTY THIRSTY broke alertly, ceded the early lead to BACALAR and stalked that rival through solid fractions nearing the half-mile marker, went up and
pressed BACALAR into the turn and battled that rival into the stretch, took a narrow advantage at the furlong marker and dug in while keeping foes at bay
into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and held in the final strides to prove best. A ROUSING BABE forwardly placed away from the
start, tracked the solid early pace from between runners, waited behind rivals nearing the quarter marker and angled three wide into upper stretch, chased
the leading pair to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and pressured the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and held
safely at the finish for second. MO TOWN GAL rated off of the solid early pace, went two wide into the turn and advanced at the quarter marker, continued
her bid into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong pole, raced in tight and lacked room nearing the sixteenth-marker, found room too late and bested
BACALAR for show honors. BACALAR broke a step slowly, rushed up in the early stages and set the pace heading to the half-mile marker, carved out solid
fractions into the turn and was pressed to the quarter pole by PRETTY THIRSTY, battled that rival into the stretch, stubbornly fought on past the furlong
marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth, weakened late and was nailed for third at the finish. MORNING ADDICTION chased the solid early
pace from the outside, gained ground three to four wide into the turn, lost position into the stretch and could not find the needed late response. TRULY
FABULOUS was asked to rate in the early stages and settled off of the solid early pace, saved ground into the turn and was outrun to the quarter pole,
lacked a response in the stretch drive and did not factor.

Footnotes
AFFECTIONTO AUTISM away in good order, took back off of the decent early pace and tracked from the outside approaching the half-mile marker, gained
ground five wide along the turn and was roused into the stretch, loomed at the furlong marker and took command past mid-stretch, held a slim lead into the
final sixteenth, dug in into deep stretch, edged away in the final strides to prevail, was injured on the gallop out and was vanned off. DRIVER'S ED broke
alertly, showed good speed and set the early pace approaching the half-mile marker, showed the way into the turn and set decent fractions nearing the
quarter pole, came under pressure into the stretch and held foes at bay heading to the furlong grounds, was overtaken past mid-stretch and gamely battled
into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the winner in deep stretch and determinedly held for second at the wire. GROSS PROFIT close up to the decent
early pace, chased three wide into the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, continued his bid into the stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong
marker, was outkicked in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. GRAZEN SUN chased the decent early pace while outside
of rivals, was well placed into the turn and raced four wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, traveled on the left lead into the final sixteenth
and did not offer a late rally. MY DOMINATOR rated off of the decent early pace while not far back, went two wide into the turn and gained ground nearing
the quarter marker, came into tight quarters and was stuck behind rivals at the top of the stretch, was boxed in at the furlong marker, checked and altered
course into the final sixteenth and could not make an impact at the finish. GONNA GETCHA GOOD broke in a bit at the start and was off a step slowly,
rushed up in the early stages and stalked the decent pace from a two wide position, advanced into the turn and chased the pace nearing the quarter marker,
loomed into upper stretch and vied for the lead at the furlong pole, could not sustain his run into the final sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch.

SUGAR BEETS came away in good order, rated kindly inside while always traveling well, bided time to the far turn, responded when given the cue to go on
to bid for the lead near the quarter pole, took command turning into the stretch met with no resistance, opened up and drew away as the rider pleased to an
easy win. PLAYBOY STYLE was prompted away from the gate to get forward position then settled three or four wide in a tracking position, then launched a
rally with three furlongs to run while four wide on the far turn, finished up well under steady handling and gained the place while no match for the winner.
GALLANT WARREN unhurried from the break, raced near the back of the pack and five wide through the early going, got over to the inside before the far
turn then launched a rally from the seven-sixteenths pole, was not improving through the turn but cut the corner into the stretch then kept to task inside,
finished up well and gained third. POUR ON THE COLE was not asked for speed from the break then tucked over to the rail when clear, settled well behind
the field through the first half mile then went into a drive from there, built up some momentum through the far turn, came into the stretch four wide, continued
to run on under steady handling but was unable to crack the top three in a decent effort. BRONZE WARRIOR was sent from the gate and seized the early
lead, was successful in slowing down the pace and took the field to the far turn under little pressure, quickened passing the three furlong marker then was
unable to go with SUGAR BEETS when that one bid at the quarter pole, was kept to task to try to hold second but tired in the final furlong. TITOS WITH A
TWIST stalked BRONZE WARRIOR from the first turn, never putting hard pressure on that one and keeping a length or two behind, was unable to go on
when the pace quickened at the three furlong marker, then struggled to keep up, faded and was outrun the rest of the way.

MASTERY KAT allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, tracked the pace two to three wide into the first turn, raced widest into the backstretch
run and was well positioned nearing the half-mile marker, was roused three wide into the far turn, loomed into upper stretch and battled SMILE AND
PROFILE approaching the furlong marker, shook free into the final sixteenth and kicked clear under firm hand urging in deep stretch. SMILE AND PROFILE
prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead and stalked RIVER MARKET into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the backstretch run,
was roused into the second turn and took command at the quarter marker, was confronted by MASTERY KAT into upper stretch and met that bid nearing
the furlong marker, could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth and held for second at the finish. AFTER MY OWN HEART hopped at the
start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and was forwardly placed into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the
half-mile marker, chased two wide into the far turn and responded to urging into the stretch, rallied at mid-stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker,
was outkicked into the final sixteenth and missed for second, while clear in the end for third. JULIET'S KITCHEN unhurried in the early stages, was content
to trail along the backstretch run, advanced three to four wide into the far turn, continued her rally into the stretch, could not sustain her bid into the final
sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. GUIDE MY STEPS paused at the start and was away from the gate a bit slowly, settled into the first turn and
saved ground into the backstretch run, maintained an inside path into the second turn, raced a bit in tight into upper stretch and angled out for the drive, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the final stages. HELLO BABY was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run
and advanced nearing the half-mile marker, raced two wide and between rivals into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not offer a late response.
RIVER MARKET broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, sped to a clear lead into the first turn and showed the way into the backstretch
run, set decent fractions while clear nearing the half-mile pole, was overtaken by SMILE AND PROFILE nearing the quarter marker, lost position into the
stretch and tired in the final furlong.

NORTH COUNTRY displayed no early speed and dropped far behind the strung-out field early, rallied boldly through the far turn and continued the run up
the rail then steadied hard approaching the furlong marker, regrouped, surged through an opening at the sixteenth pole and went on to prevail. GALLAND
DE BESOS was inside of a trio tracking well behind the runaway leader then was the first to break away at the three furlong pole and went after the leader,
got the lead inside the furlong pole but could not hold off the winner in the final yards. ADIOS NICANOR tracked three wide to the turn, was then having to
be ridden to keep up, went four wide into the stretch, produced a nice rally down the middle of the track and just missed second. CUT ACROSS SHORTY
tracked between horses, launched a bid with three furlongs to run, finished willingly under strong handling but came up short. GOLDENSUNRISE was
quickest from the gate and opened up a clear uncontested lead, set fast fractions, passed the quarter pole still well clear of the rest then began to shorten
strides in upper stretch, soldiered on but was passed in the final furlong. TOO MUCH INFO outrun from the break, came under a ride from the three furlong
pole, swung four wide into the stretch and passed one straggler late. RAMATHORN chased the runaway leader from the start, came under heavy pressure
near the quarter pole, did not go on and tired in the stretch.

stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task while clear into the final sixteenth, dug in while under pressure in deep stretch and
determinedly lasted for the win at the wire. MOTHER'S PRAYER settled just off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, maintained an inside
position into the backstretch run and was well placed nearing the half-mile marker, saved all of the ground into the far turn, was boxed in at the quarter
marker and angled three to four wide into upper stretch, lost a bit of ground at the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, surged in deep stretch and
just missed for the win, while holding safely at the finish for second in a game runner-up effort. MR. T'S THIRSTY close up to the early pace, stalked three to
four wide into the first turn, was well positioned into the backstretch run and chased the decent pace nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a three wide bid
at the quarter pole and vied for the lead into upper stretch, was outkicked at mid-stretch, stayed on into the final sixteenth but could not make headway on
LAW ABIDING in deep stretch and was outfinished for place honors. SUPERMAZEL allowed to settle while not far back in the early stages, raced four to
five wide into the first turn and carried out KINGMEISTER approaching the three-quarters marker, tracked the decent pace through the backstretch run,
raced three to two wide into the far turn and was well placed nearing the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and could not muster a late response.
KINGMEISTER allowed to settle away from the start, was carried five to six wide along the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and
raced widest approaching the half-mile marker, mounted a four wide bid into the far turn, could not sustain that run into the stretch and flattened out in the
drive. MOHAWK KING (IRE) showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn and set decent
fractions into the backstretch run, was prompted to the half-mile marker by LAW ABIDING and dueled that runner into the second turn, lost the lead at the
quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SAWASDEE broke best and took the lead in hand, was confidently ridden despite having a host of pursuers, set down at the three-sixteenths pole,
quickened, then finished strong under steady handling, holding off a fast closing SATANTA in the final yards. SATANTA was allowed to settle into stride and
tracked well behind in the four path down the backstretch, remained in the clear, circled the field five wide, continued to run on in the stretch and just
missed. J D'S RUDE BOY outrun from the break, saved ground while launching a rally through the turn swung five wide into the stretch then became stuck
behind horses in upper stretch, tried to run through a hole approaching the furlong marker but was beaten to it, tipped out to the middle of the track and
finished well under strong handling to just get up for the show. IDIOT'S GOLD broke well but backed out of a developing speed duel, settled in a pocket
behind the pace then started to advance on the turn, was boxed in until the turn for home, squeezed through a narrow opening just before the eighth pole,
kept on but needed more. DANZING REBEL came away well and took up a stalking position just behind and to the outside of SAWASDEE, kept that
position into and through the turn, made a bid for the lead near the quarter pole but could not get by, was kept in a drive to the wire but was outfinished for a
minor award. DR. SOULFIRE was a little slow into stride then was prompted to rush up and join the early pace battle, stayed on the rail through the turn and
loomed boldly approaching the quarter pole but had nowhere to make a run, got clear turning into the stretch but did not go on when asked and was
outkicked in the late stages. OUR BOLD PRINCE broke well raced close up down the backstretch but was stuck on the outside, went three to four wide
through the turn, was third of four horses fanned out across the track at the quarter pole all looking to bid for the lead but could not go on with the rest in the
stretch and faltered in deep stretch.
