Footnotes
AURELIAN MAN moved around just before the gates opened but still came away quickest, controlled the pace from along the rail, roused approaching the
quarter pole, put to the right hand in the lane and held well. BIRTH OF COOL was closest in pursuit from the two path, took aim two wide entering the
stretch, chased willingly through the final furlong but could only gain minor ground late. BEE CATCHER rank early chasing from the rail, saved ground to the
stretch and edged NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) for the show honors. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) rank early three wide on the first turn then moved into
the two path, chased between rivals in the middle stages, continued in the two path to the stretch and got outkicked for third. LIMITED HEATWAVE ran up
on heels on the first turn, trailed along the rail, moved out in the lane and failed to menace. TOM AND JAZZY settled outside a rival in the two path prior to
the clubhouse turn, began to pull and tipped out to the three path, continued to tug the rider forward outside rivals early on the backstretch, lost ground
around the far turn and faded down the lane.

upper stretch, lightly coaxed in the final sixteenth and held safely. SO THERE SHE WAS dropped back early under coaxing, raced two wide then moved to
the rail around the bend, angled out in upper stretch and came with a late run but could not reach the winner. RUNNIN ON PROMISES chased three wide to
the stretch and lacked a rally when called upon. ANGEL FROM ABOVE closest in pursuit of NIGHT BEACON in the two path to the stretch and tired in the

Footnotes
MASTERMIND controlled the pace in hand along the rail, drew away on the far turn still confidently handled, coaxed along in upper stretch, tapped right
handed past the eighth pole and was ridden out to the wire. GRANADA FLAVOR stalked three deep around the clubhouse turn, rounded the far turn in the
two path, chased willingly down the lane but to no avail. TEMBO chased five deep into the first turn then moved into the four path, traveled three deep in the
middle stages, took the second turn three wide then came four wide into the drive and lacked a bid. STAY IN THE GAME stalked in the two path, weakened
along the rail on the far turn and had little left for the stretch run. FLINT STROLL chased four deep early then ducked down to the rail on the clubhouse turn,
trailed up the backstretch, went outside a rival into the far turn, spun five wide into the lane, drifted to the inside and never threatened.

SHE'S A JOKER pressed the pace from outside, chased the leader into the turn, re-bid at the quarter pole, put a head in front at the eighth pole and held
gamely to the wire. PINK ACE set the pace from inside under pressure, inched ahead into the turn, challenged again at the quarter pole, lost command in
upper stretch, fought back from inside and stayed on to the wire. DENDERA stalked the top pair from the rail position, saved ground to the stretch, chased
willingly through the lane and could only gain minor ground late. BLONDE BOMBSHELL stalked the leaders outside DENDERA to the stretch, stayed within
striking distance through the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick. CONTROL FUNCTION was a bit rank early then settled off the pace,
saved ground around the turn, tipped out into the stretch and summoned a mild rally. DEFICIT MAJA dropped back early, rounded the bend two wide,
moved out and could not threaten.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LOVE pressed the pace from outside, headed DES DOIGTS around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch and kicked clear in the late stages.
OUTGUNNED chased the leaders four wide into the turn, moved into the three path, came out past the quarter pole, kept on under right handed urging and
got up for second. DES DOIGTS showed the way early under pressure from MIDNIGHT LOVE to the outside, headed by that rival around the bend, lost
command in upper stretch, fought to midstretch, weakened in the final sixteenth but managed to save third. WINNING BIG trailed early off the inside under
coaxing, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the rail to save ground, moved back out in the lane and never threatened.

Footnotes
YELLOW SUN DRESS chased outside rivals, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, took over leaving the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and
remained strong to the wire. CERTITUDE (FR) got bumped leaving the gate, chased from off the pace then pulled closer from the half-mile pole to the
three-eighths pole, rounded the bend two then three wide, tipped out in the lane and edged ANG N ASH for second. ANG N ASH stalked along the inside,
tipped two wide at the quarter pole, finished determinedly through the lane but got outkicked for the place honors. CHEEKIEST antsy in the gate, broke in
and bumped CERTITUDE (FR), trailed early and moved inside, tipped out leaving the turn, angled out further in the stretch and improved position.
TOPOLINA closest in pursuit in the early going, bid from outside leaving the backstretch, got brushed by inner rival at the three-eighths pole, took over past
the five-sixteenths marker, lost command leaving the turn and weakened down the lane. ELTONSINGSANOTHER sat off the pace then moved closer
nearing the turn, rounded the bend in the three path, got moved out entering the lane, shifted back inward and weakened. PERFECT IN GRAY showed
good early foot and set the tone up the backstretch, challenged from outside approaching the turn, lost command past the five-sixteenths pole and folded.

SABRES dueled for the lead from inside, cleared CASTAGNA leaving the turn, responded when asked left handed and was kept busy to the wire. I'M STILL
IN IT stalked the top pair off the rail, took aim three wide into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch and bested the rest. CASTAGNA dueled for the lead from
outside, kept the pressure on into and around the turn, lost touch with the winner into the lane and flattened to third. DEVIL D' ORO laid off the pace, went
four wide into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend, came back out into the drive and failed to threaten. WINNING LUCK chased two wide
leaving the backstretch, moved to the rail on the turn and came up empty when called upon. TO BEVY'S off slow in the beginning, trailed wide up the
backstretch, five wide into the turn, steered down to the two path around the bend and failed to make an impact. SMOOTH AS BUTTER stalked the top pair
from the fence, started weaken while saving ground through the turn and tired down the lane.

VRONSKY FEINT stalked the top pair up the backstretch, waited for room around the bend, gained an opening entering the stretch, launched a bid from
inside in upper stretch and proved best in the final sixteenth. GRAZEN IN THE SUN set the pace inside HOTITUDE, dueled with that rival while coming off
the rail into the stretch, clung to a narrow lead with a furlong remaining and yielded grudgingly in deep stretch. HOTITUDE prompted the pace from outside,
dueled into the stretch, fought three deep in the furlong grounds and lacked the needed final kick. SHARP RIDE settled along the inside, chased two wide
into the lane and lacked further response. ISSA COURT shook her head then hopped at the start, moved into range outside rivals, chased two wide around
the turn, tipped out exiting the bend and weakened. BIG HOPES broke a bit slow, traveled outside a rival at the back, trailed on the inside into the stretch,
moved off the fence and was never a factor.
