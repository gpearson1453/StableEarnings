Footnotes
MY LITTLE PRINCE showed the way from the inside into the turn, maintained the lead while in a steady drive down the lane, drifting out in late stretch and
lasted to the wire to prevail. TEXAS TITAN moved down the backstretch while four wide, then bid in gamely in attempt to gain the lead at the quarter pole,
lacked the winning and held onto the place position in stretch. FLIP THE COIN JAN chased the pace while three wide, was urging eagerly throughout the
turn to rally in the stretch and was best for the show position. TILLIS broke outwardly and bumped rival, was allowed to settle along the rail, then circled five
wide leaving the bend to rally in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. GRAMI'S BOY lunged at the start, then raced while two wide mid pack, bid
from the inside on the turn, continued to menace between rivals in the upper stretch and came up empty in the end. CARPE EROS was bumped at the start,
then pursued the pace while two wide, was in a hard drive throughout the turn, was used up at the top of the stretch and tired in the end. TIZ ALLUPTOME
NOW was unhurried early, then bid mildly on the turn while two wide and was no threat. CALIPARI was out run and failed to rally.

Footnotes
TURN NORTH was brushed at the start, then chased the pace while three wide, inched up on the turn to edge pass the dueling pair at the top of the stretch
then drew off to prevail in the end. VINO TEXAS JESS was hindered at the start, saved ground in the early furlongs, then found the best stride in the late
stretch and was up for the place prize. COMES THE SUN drifted out and brushed rival at the start, then led the way briefly before battling with inner rivals
into the turn, continued to duel for the place position down the lane then was out finished by an outer rival and missed the place prize in the end. EXPECT
GLORY moved swiftly along the inside to vie for the lead from the inside, continued to duel with an outer rival leaving the turn, was passed up by TURN
NORTH at the top of the stretch then continued to duel for the place prize in the final yards and missed both the place and show prize in the end. TIGER
MAN MCKOOL bid between rivals down the backstretch in attempt to gain command, was in a strong drive heading into the turn, could not retain stride and
flattened out in the stretch. SUPER EKATI broke inwardly and bumped rival, then settled back at the tail of the field and was no factor. OBVIOUS
CONCLUSION lost rider shortly after the break and walked off. There was an INQUIRY in regards to the start of the race, After review, no change was
made.

Footnotes
ARINNITI (FR) tracked the pace setters from the inside in the early stages, moved up on the far turn to split rivals at the quarter pole, gained command then
drew clear in the stretch to prove best overall. MARKET PROFILE dueled from the inside momentarily before pressing the pace down the backstretch, then
vied with outer rivals on the far turn while in a gamely bid, could not catch the emerging ARINNITI in the early stretch and held onto the place position in the
end. ARMY KITTEN was reserved at the back of the field in the early furlongs, bid three wide on the far turn, steadied slightly, then shifted outward and kept
on down the lane under a mild rally and was best for show. ELMO'S SECRET was unhurried early, improved position in the late backstretch to vie with inner
rivals on the far turn, continued to rally gamely in the stretch and just missed the show prize in the end. IN OPEN COURT raced in the middle of the field
from the inside, then bid leaving the far turn while two wide, angled inward in the late stretch and continued to rally mildly but it was not enough in the end.
GIRLS GOT GAME was allowed to settle along the inside, bid from the two path on the far turn, steadied avoiding rival, then re bid in the stretch but it was
too little too late. BAYOU BEAUTY bid between rivals in attempt to lead the way into the first turn, was rank and settled back to chase the pace setters down
the backstretch, then flattened out throughout the far turn and passed a tired foe in the end. CAJUN DOLL duel briefly while two wide throughout the first
turn, then took charge down the backstretch, was challenged by rivals on both sides on the far turn was used up and weakened in the stretch.

UNION DATA led the way from the inside, felt the pressure from an outer foe on the turn, then dug in gamely to draw clear in the late stretch while in a
determined drive. CREATIVE MIRACLE was well rated while pursuing the pace while two wide, then moved on the turn to gain second position in the early
stretch, rallied gamely but could not catch the cleared leader in the end. POSEIDONS WAVE stalked the pace from the three path, then bid in gamely on the
turn in attempt to gain the lead at the quarter pole, could not overpower a determined UNION DATA and gave way in the lane. DO YOUR JOB pressed the
pace while two wide in the early yards, then settled back heading into the turn and lacked rallying in the late stretch. BOARD CERTIFIED chased the pace
from the inside at an even pace throughout and needed more in the end. BIG PAPER DADDY stalked the leader while two wide, then faded on the turn and
had no final bid in the stretch.

sway down the lane to prove best in the end. CATHOLIC SUE saved ground mid pack, then rallied in the upper stretch and was able to get up for the place
prize in the end. LAST WINE FOR ME regardless of being bumped on both sides at the start, was able to set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive
heading into the stretch while maintaining the lead then faltered in the final yards. MO'S KITTEN broke inwardly and bumped foe, then tucked along the
inside towards to back, menaced leaving the turn and came up flat in the lane. MAGICALTHINGZTODO shifted inward at the start, avoiding rival, then
trailed early, bid mildly in the late stretch and was no threat. MONTANA'S ANGEL was bumped at the start, then raced in the middle of the pack from the
inside at moderate pace, bid in the upper stretch and was no threat. INDY SPRINKLES was impeded at the start, was unhurried early, then made a mild bid
on the turn while three wide and made no impact in the end. THAT'S ABOUT IT raced in the middle of the pack while three wide, then settled back on the

sides at the top of the stretch, lugged in bumping rival then was out finished in the end. CHIEF BRADY prompted the pace while two wide, was in a hard
drive throughout the turn, then was over taken for second position at the quarter pole and flattened out in the late stretch. JOSH'S DREAM tucked along the
inside, then came out four to five wide leaving the bend and was no threat. IBERIAN RUNNER settled at the back and was no menace. There was a
STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference in the stretch. After reviewing the replay, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
BIG BERNIE broke inwardly, then set the pace from the inside, was threatened by rivals on the far turn, had more to pull away in the stretch while in a
strong drive to succeed in the end. BATTLE STRIKE was bumped at the start, then was reserved at the tail of the field in the early stages, improved position
steadily on the far turn to duel with an outer rival for the place prize and was up at the wire. NEXT REVOLT was forced inwardly at the start, then chased the
pace from the inside, was in a steady drive throughout the far turn, then bid gamely in the stretch while dueling for second position and missed the place
prize in the end. SHOTSHELL pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, continued to urged steadily throughout the far turn while stalking
the leader, then gave way in the stretch. TEJAS was allowed to settle towards the back in the early stages, then bid mildly leaving the far turn and was no
threat. PROJECTION chased the pace while two wide, then dropped back after the half and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NIGHTWIND tracked the pace from the inside in the early furlongs, remained well rated throughout the far turn, dug in gamely to battle briefly with outer
rivals, then took command at the eighth pole and held on grudgingly to claim victory in the end. CINCO RICHIE raced in the middle of the field from the
inside, then bid while three wide on the far turn, then closed well down the lane while passing rivals to be up for the place prize. TEAM GORMLEY tracked
the leader from the two path down the backstretch, then menaced leaving the far turn to vie with inner rivals at the top of the stretch then was out finished in
the end. OZZIES WINGS Y G raced mid pack from the inside, was in a hard drive leaving the far turn, then shifted inward, continued to rally gamely but
needed more in the end. KING ARTHUR RIDGE was unhurried early, then rallied in the home stretch and kept on down the lane but it was not enough in
the end. MORO MAFIA was bumped at the start, raced while four wide down the backstretch, was in a steady urge on the far turn to rally mildly in the home
stretch and came up empty. TEXAS CLUBMAN raced in the middle of the pack while three wide down the backstretch, was in a mild drive throughout the far
turn and did not fire in the home stretch. CRAZY RIDGE broke outwardly then bumped rival, set the pace from the inside, was in a long drive leaving the far
turn to battle between rivals in the early stretch, was depleted and weakened in the end. FOO FLIGHTER drifted outward heading into the first turn, then
settled at the back and failed to rally. COWTOWN FLYER bore out heading into the first turn, then settled towards the back while two wide and was no

enough. BLUSHING BELLE stalked the pace from the inside, then rallied on the turn and into the stretch and was able to get up for the show prize in the
end. RUBIANA set the pace while two wide, was in a steady drive throughout the turn, was overtaken for the lead at the top of the stretch then flattened out
in the final yards. DIAMONDS N ACES settled back to chase the pace from the inside, then made a mild bid in the stretch and was no threat. HAPPY

Footnotes
INTERSTELLAR was away well to show the way throughout while in a steady hand ride then drew off at the top of the stretch and was ridden out confidently
to the wire. EL SMOOCH stalked the leader while two wide throughout, lacked the winning bid in the final stages and held onto the place prize in the end.
BRAZIL NUT saved ground in the early stages, came out four wide leaving the far turn and was up for the show prize. GRAZEN BOY broke outwardly and
bumped rival, chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch, bid in the home stretch to no success in the end. LIVINGSTON raced between fields
from the inside, was bumped by a retreating rival at the three eighths pole, then continued to exchange bumps with the same rival throughout the far turn
and into the early stretch and kept on to no avail in the end. RU MOR STARTER chased the pace from the three path down the early backstretch, dropped
back and bumped inner rival, then bid throughout the far and into the early stretch while bumping said rival and came up empty in the end. JOHNNY
APPLESEED chased the pace from the inside, settled back on the far turn then continued to flatten out in the stretch. GRACE'S HANK failed to menace.
SEND OFF was no factor. EYE OF THE PANTHOR was bumped outward at the start and lacked the momentum to contend. There was an INQUIRY in
regards to interference in the far turn. After review, no change was made.
