Footnotes
RECONCILING FORCE pressed the pace to the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. LOTTA GUSTO
saved ground to the turn, angled out, closed well and was no match for the winner. RESTLESS RAMBLER was sent to the front to set the pace to the turn,
fell back, went evenly late and held for show. ALL IN STEW OUI was void of early speed, offered a mild late bid and improved position. GORDY'S RULES
was not a factor. CONTEJAS was never far back, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. BUMBLEBEE was outrun.

and gave way. THIRSTY ECHO vied for the lead, was checked entering the second turn and stopped. I'M A COOL CAT trailed the field.

O SHUGAH MINT set the pace, drew off on the second turn and extended her lead while ridden out. PARK IN THE DARK broke out, raced close to the
pace, bid inside, couldn't gain ground and was no match for the winner. KATZIE BABY was slow early, put in a steady effort and improved position to be
along for show. MY BELLA FOR LISA was a bit fractious in the gate, pressed the pace to the second turn and tired. TAMMY MACHO was a bit fractious in
the gate, never far off the pace and had nothing left for the drive. BURNINGDAYLIGHT raced close to the pace along the inside and flattened out. AUNT
BENNIE was slow early, raced inside and showed little. ICY REBEL failed to contend in an outside trip. YUMIKO'S CANDY was fractious in the gate,
crowded at the start and showed little. SNOOZY SUZY went five wide on the first turn, never far off the pace, tired into the second turn and stopped.

Footnotes
JON L pressed the pace, challenged into the turn, dueled for the lead, inched clear and just lasted. JUST CALL ME KEN raced close to the pace in an
outside trip, closed steadily, was gaining late and just missed at the wire. IZA DADDY was unhurried early, raced inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide,
finished well and was gaining fast late. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST was checked at the start and into the first turn, swung wide leaving the second turn and
closed well. EFFORT N RESULTS pressed the pace while racing inside, rallied into the turn to challenge, fell back and went evenly late. HESA
PROSPECTOR was sent to the front to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged to duel and faltered mid stretch. REVOLT AND RIOT pressed
the pace, was through early and gave way. MENTIROSA was not a factor.

save ground, angled out on the turn, swung wide and improved position. SPARKLE IN THE SKY showed speed to the second turn, tired and gave way.

BIG CREED set the pace, drew clear on the second turn and extended the lead under mild urging. MY GOOD GOOD BOY stalked the pace, lacked the
needed late response and was all out for place. ABETEMARCO lagged early, bid off the rail, didn't have enough left and was outfinished for second. THE
RONALD failed to menace in an even effort. BRANNIGAN raced mid pack along the inside, had nothing left for the drive and faded. ROAD OF LOVE was

Footnotes
ATTILAS TORNADO assumed command into the turn and held under pressure. INDIAN NIGHTS got through along the rail on the turn, bid willingly, didn't
have enough late and was all out for place. ZACH WHO was crowded after the start, came in, bumped mildly, pressed the pace, rallied three across on the
turn and went willingly to the wire. HENNESSY LOOKER RF veered out at the start, swung wide entering the stretch and finished well. CASH CRUZER
bumped mildly after the start and offered a mild bid mid track tlo improve position. SPEND AGAIN was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn and offered a
mild bid only. MOZART J was hustled along to set a pressured pace, fell back and weakened in the drive. NOGAL CANYON dropped inside to save ground
and failed to threaten in an even effort. FLAG THE FOOTNOTE was not a factor. MANY AMBITIONS broke in, was taken outside, swung wide leaving the
turn and lacked a bid.
