Footnotes
DOC SULLIVAN moved out to chased the early pace from the outside, then settled in on the turn in the two to three path, came off the turn four wide and
then angled in leaving the three sixteenths for racing room, closed well and moved out slightly in side the sixteenth marker to draw clear to prove best. J D
FACTOR chased the pace three wide, then was three to four wide on the turn and finished willingly to catch the pacesetter on the wire to get the place
award. PROPRIETARY TRADE broke in at the start, then went up and crossed over to set the pace, drew clear on the turn and widened the margin off the
bend, but was caught inside the sixteenth marker and lost the place award on the wire. THAT'S MONEY stalked the pace two to three wide and came three
wide off the bend but faded. SPEED RUNNER was bumped at the start, settled and moved down to the inside, saved ground on the turn and had no
response while being no threat. Race was delayed seventeen minutes due to a tractor being stalled out on the track.

Footnotes
MACANGA established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand just off the inside, shook away briefly midway down the backstretch, tucked
inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and edged clear under a drive kept to
task. OVERSUBSCRIBED (GB) broke a bit awkward getting away last, settled two to three wide in pursuit near the rear of the field, took to the two path just
outside the three-eighths and had AGRA tuck directly in front just inside that station into the far turn and was forced to check and alter course three wide in
turn forcing SURPRENANT COCCA to check and alter out in behind her, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
angled in straightened away and rallied following the winner a furlong out and showed good courage to secure the place honors in the final jumps. AGRA
just off the pace three wide past the stands, tucked to the two path through the first turn before chasing two to three wide down the backstretch, tucked to
the two path fully just inside the three-eighths impeding OVERSUBSCRIBED and forcing that rival to check and alter out in concert with SURPRENANT
COCCA in behind her, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. TINA
BALLERINA chased just off the inside through to the three-eighths, tucked inside at that station, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to
three wide into upper stretch and kept on through to the finish. SURPRENANT COCCA broke in at the start brushing BERTRILLE, tracked the front from the
tail of the field two to three wide, got checked and altered out and spun six wide when OVERSUBSCRIBED got impeded directly in front by AGRA, came
under coaxing inside that station, went five to six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BERTRILLE got brushed at the start by SURPRENANT
COCCA, who broke inwards, chased along the inside, got briefly steadied when rivals outside were impeded just inside three furlongs to run, cut the corner
into upper stretch under a drive and weakened. BERNIETAKESCHARGE three then two wide through the first turn, raced two to three wide in closest aim of
the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DONTLOOKBACKATALL stalked the early pace towards the inside under a hard hold, ranged up three wide off the bend to make a bid in hand, hit the front
at the furlong marker and shook clear under mild urging, then maintained a safe margin to the wire under a confident ride. GAL IN A RUSH was settled
early, two wide on the turn, angled out by the furlong marker for racing room, then bumped with HONEY PANTS by the sixteenth marker and rallied in
between rivals to gain the place award. HONEY PANTS tracked the early pace two wide, then was two to three wide on the turn and came four wide into the
lane, then bumped with a rival by the sixteenth marker and finished willingly. LADY MILAGRO was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, was headed by
the winner by the furlong marker and dug in but faded late. RISK FREE was allowed to settle on the inside but lacked a rally.

THANK YOU JON broke in at the start brushing MY MAN WOODY, raced forwardly placed and established the front just inside six and a half furlongs to run
and showed the way just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, tipped out four wide into upper stretch and was roused straightened away, edged
clear under a drive to prevail. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into
upper stretch, ran on to secure the place honors. DEPUTY CONNECT chased three wide from the tail of the field, came under coaxing from the half mile
pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. FLASHY ALEX chased just off the inside under a ride from midway on the turn, angled four
wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. YOUBETTERBEJOKING coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the leader, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BARGAINING POWER prompted the pace three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. OPPORTUNITY SET
coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide until tucked inside near the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and offered no rally. MY MAN WOODY got brushed at the start by THANK YOU JON, prompted the pace along the inside, came under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths and faded, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

LITTLE LINZEE vied for the lead on the outside and made a four wide bid off the bend to gain a short lead, then was kept to a long driver to prove best.
TEMPERMENTAL vied for the lead in between rivals, then fought on gamely to wire and held off BACKED BY GOLD to save the place award. BACKED BY
GOLD tracked the pace from the outside, four wide on the turn and came five wide off the bend and rallied well late. JACKSON'S DIXIE vied fort the lead on
the inside and dug in by the furlong marker but faded late. HARLAN'S BOND chased the pace and saved ground on the turn, moved out in the lane and had
a belated rally. TRUE EMPRESS was settled early, raced two to three wide on the turn, swung out sevben wide leaving the turn but had no rally. MY FIRST
LOVE chased the early pace in was in between rivals on the turn but lacked the needed bid.

BAD LARRY coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, drew off under a drive drifting out a bit while kept to task. TWELTH MAN broke in a step at the start brushing
INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER, chased four wide patiently handled until set down tipped five wide at the head of the stretch, proved no match for the top one
while running on to safely secure the place honors. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER brushed at the start by TWELTH MAN then was taken up in tight between
horses, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing midway, angled six to seven wide
into upper stretch and was along well clear and best of the rest. SINFUL DANCER coaxed from the gate, chased five then three wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. WINNING CONNECTION broke a half a beat slow when tossing his head at the start,
chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside
into upper stretch and faltered.

DONCHO was away alertly and dueled for the lead to the outside of BUCCHERINO, then made a two wide bid on the turn in hand to shake clear, then
came three wide off the bend while clear, then was roused left handed inside the furlong grounds and responded well to remain clear to the wire. MAXIMUS
MERIDIUS tracked the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and ran on well to the wire but could not get to the winner while being clearly
second best. BUCCHERINO dueled for the early lead on the inside, then could not keep up with the winner on the turn and faded in the drive while staying
on for the show award. PIRATE was reserved early, two wide on the turn and then came off the bend towards the inside, angled out nearing the furlong
marker and advanced then angled back in late to just miss the show award. BILLAL chased the early pace and was two to three wide on the turn, came five
wide off the bend and weakened. ELIMINATE was bumped and off slowly, trailed early and was three wide on the turn, came seven wide off the turn and
had no rally. IRIDESCENT was hard to settle and raced four wide on the turn and was not a threat. YO YO CANDY broke out and bumped foe at the start,
then chased the pace on the inside and weakened.
