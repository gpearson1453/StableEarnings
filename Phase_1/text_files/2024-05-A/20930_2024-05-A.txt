Footnotes
ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR was reserved off the early pace while racing three-wide, moved up to take the lead nearing the quarter pole and drew off to win
something left. ABOVE THE REST saved ground setting the pressured pace, responded when asked and while no match for the winner held on well for the
place. CASH'S CAT prompted ABOVE THE REST to near the quarter pole from along the outside and weakened. BENNY BUCKETS saved ground while
being allowed to settle but lacked a rally when called upon. STREET MINISTER hopped in the air at the start then was unhurried early, came three-wide into
the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.

AUTOCRAT was prominently placed while racing three-wide, took the lead entering the stretch and gradually drew clear. J C'S A LEGEND bobbled at the
start, then was reserved off the pace while racing four-wide on the turn and finished well for second in a steady effort. GYPSY GUN set the pace while
racing slightly off the rail, responded when headed and held on fairly well for third. SECRET SAGA was close-up early while saving ground, slipped through
entering the stretch but lacked the needed late response. HALF THROTTLE was unhurried early, rallied three-wide the final quarter and was gaining slightly
late.

MY SUNSHINE disputed the pace racing three-wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and maintained a safe advantage. SUMMER SHANDEE saved
ground chasing the early pace, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and closed strongly. ARTHUR SPOONER vied with TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT and
MY SUNSHINE for the lead from along the inside, responded when headed and held on gamely during the drive for the show. MOON TIME was forwardly
placed on the turn while four-wide, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT vied for the lead from along the inside for a half
mile and ended up in a dead-heat for fifth with LOLO PANIOLO while weakening. LOLO PANIOLO was unhurried early, came six-wide into the stretch and
ended up on even terms with TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT while failing to seriously threaten.

FAST TIMES prompted the issue while racing four-wide, took the lead entering the stretch, opened a lead nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe
advantage. DYNAMIC SECRET was close-up early racing between horses, was shuffled back nearing the three-eighths pole then came six-wide into the
stretch and closed strongly. PAKAS SECRET vied for the lead with ALIANTE racing between horses, came three-wide into the stretch and finished well for
third in a steady effort. LONG GONE SILVER was allowed to settle early, split rivals nearing the quarter pole while two-wide offering a bid entering the
stretch and then flattened out during the drive. CONNECTER disputed the pace to near the stretch while three-wide and weakened. WAITINGATTHEBAR
was off a step then unhurried, came three-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten. ALLANTE vied for the lead from along the inside and tired. IM
GUNNA bobbled at the start then raced four-wide on the turn and failed to menace.

COASTAL JAZZ was prominently placed racing along the outside, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole gained the lead nearing the eighth pole and
gradually edged clear. BOSS OF THEMOSS vied for the lead with CODE CHARLIE, responded when headed nearing the eighth pole and continued on
gamely for the place. OVERLY FAST was reserved off the early pace while saving ground, angled out nearing the eighth pole for room and finished in a mild
rally. FIREWALKER was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. CODE CHARLIE broke in the air then rushed up to
dispute the pace to the stretch and tired.

ROCKIT A DAY disputed the pace while racing three-wide, gained a slight lead nearing the quarter pole and gradually drew clear. HARBOR LASS dueled
for the lead from along the inside, was unable to stay with the winner during the drive but held on gamely for the place. DIPLOMATIC was forwardly placed
from the outset while racing four-wide but lacked the needed late response. LADY MORMONT prompted the issue from between horses and weakened
slightly late. MY MOTORHOME was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. HIDDEN TIGER was reluctant to load
then was off a step slow, saved ground and was not a factor.
