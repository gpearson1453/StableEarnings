Footnotes
BRIEF NOTE , six wide into the first turn, remained well wide prompting the pace outside the leader, responded when asked and took a short lead soon into
the lane, dueled from there, switched over to her left lead in deep stretch and held firm while kept to task. SWEET AND EZ was guided five wide entering
the first turn, held a slim lead between foes while firmly rated leaving the three quarter pole, dropped in a path or two nearing the stretch, ceded command
soon after then stayed on valiantly inside the winner. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW vied between runners into the backstretch, tracked two to three wide leaving
the far turn, swung out under a ride pursuing into the stretch and faded. EZ ALL THE WAY , with the pace inside a trio of rivals into the backstretch, was
under pressure chasing past the five sixteenths, swung well wide and faltered.

Footnotes
HERON BAY settled off the inside, edged up about four wide into the far turn, came under a ride soon after, circled rivals five wide into the lane, leveled off
under left handed asks leaving the furlong grounds, wrested command outside MARK OF VICTORY past the sixteenth marker and drew clear. MARK OF
VICTORY rated off the inside early on, dropped in towards the rail and moved up under some coaxing around the far turn, forged through to the inside of the
leader to take over into the stretch, cleared while guided off the inside, kept on to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. SENT BY ANGELS settled in
the clear, advanced towards the rail leaving the far turn, eased out to gain between runners past the five sixteenths, had aim three wide into the stretch,
chased between foes near mid stretch and flattened out. STAKEMAKER , unhurried early, gained along the rail from the quarter pole to mid stretch, loomed,
failed to kick on past the sixteenth marker and faded. CY'S SILKSTOCKING dueled to the inside of a rival, cleared leaving the far turn, raced off the rail
affording MARK OF VICTORY a path into the lane, failed to contain that one and weakened. SUMMER RUSS , away awkwardly, regrouped and pulled her
way forward into the first turn, stalked four wide, failed to go on entering the stretch and tired. DANDY DAY vied two to three wide outside CY'S
SILKSTOCKING, failed to keep pace leaving the three eighths and dropped back between foes. SUZZIE'S DARLIN , forwardly placed saving ground around
the first turn, dropped back after a half.

Footnotes
DESHAMBEAU prompted the pace four wide, took over in hand and between foes near the half, handled outside pressure while nicely rated around the final
turn, shook clear into the lane, spurted away when put to serious asking in mid stretch, switched over to his correct lead with a sixteenth to go and held firm.
KEEN HEIR settled off the inside into the backstretch, advanced wide into the far turn to be close, gave hard chase from the three eighths, entered the lane
about four wide, raced between runners leaving mid stretch, kept on with a grinding run and got up for second to the inside of TONY'S TAPIT. TONY'S
TAPIT fought restraint through the opening quarter mile, settled past the three quarter pole and prompted five wide outside foes, bid near the half, forced the
issue outside the winner to the quarter pole, stayed on to pursue past mid stretch then hung a bit and lost the place in the final yards. IMPOSSIBLE TASK ,
bumped at the break, was sent to the front and cleared into the backstretch, set the pace three wide, ceded to outer rivals past the half, remained a
presence to pursue to mid stretch then weakened. SAXON SAGA bumped with IMPOSSIBLE TASK at the start, saved ground stalking the early pace then
faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
PRESENT TIME vied inside foes before taking over and then guided to about the five path, handled outside pressure around the turn, shook clear under a
ride into the lane, wandered outward despite right handed asks and dug in tenaciously through the final sixteenth to prove best. DIPLOMATICA , between
foes early, emerged in a battle six wide outside the winner into the turn, pressed into the lane, drifted out through the final sixteenth but stayed on gamely to
cut back into the margin. MISSCZECH vied three deep early on, dropped in entering the turn and chased in the three path, edged up to the inside of top pair
near mid stretch then flattened out. OCTANE (BRZ) , off the pace, raced four wide mid turn, swung out very wide in the drive and had a belated kick.
LOVELY LOLA lagged back, saved ground into the stretch, moved up some past mid stretch but failed to sustain. INTERSTELLA , off the pace, raced
between runners nearing the stretch but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
HIGH GUNNER , five to six wide chasing the duelers mid turn, shifted out a bit wider in upper stretch, closed determinedly under repeated left handed ask
and just got up. SAVONA , four to five wide disputing the pace outside SWEET SONNY, took a short lead into the lane, went clear under a drive past mid
stretch, kept on gamely while on her left lead but just failed to fend off the winner's charge. EMILY SMILES , taken well wide while off the contested pace,
circled six wide into the stretch, shifted out very wide and closed well. COCKTAIL SLIPPERS prompted to the inside of foes early on, angled out as the
dueling leaders cleared off past the half, chased four wide into the lane, moved up some past mid stretch then flattened out. SWEET SONNY , three to four
wide vying inside SAVONA, stayed on well to mid stretch then faded. WE ALL AGREE was steadied off the heels of the leaders in the opening furlong,
dropped back while saving ground, swung out for the drive and rallied. PACIFIC ZIP , urged along off the pace and two to three wide, made a mild run into
the stretch then faded through the final sixteenth. QUEEN MYSTIC , towards the inside pursuing the leaders, faltered through the lane.

command outside runners soon into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then held sway while steadily hand ridden the final yards. JASMINE

Footnotes
INESPERADO , patiently handled while saving ground, took closer order past the five sixteenths, responded and moved through towards the rail to take
over leaving mid stretch, kept on determinedly under pressure and held sway. MEET JOE rated close up while saving ground, eased out into the lane,
challenged outside foes in mid stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. EMPEROR'S CHOICE vied two wide and to the inside of a rival, moved clear near
the five sixteenths, held a slim advantage between foes in mid stretch, ceded soon after and gave way grudgingly. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) ,
unhurried early while saving ground, continued inside into the stretch, swung out near the furlong ground and finished with good energy. PLAYOFF BOUND
drifted in a bit after the break and steadied briefly, moved up two wide past the five sixteenths, shifted out in the drive and faded. HONKY TONK HERO ,
three wide into the first turn, settled off the pace, angled to about the seven path in upper stretch but lacked a serious finish. IRISH HEATWAVE , taken to
rate early, rushed up between runners nearing the far turn, pursued past the five sixteenths, shifted out to about the four path and gave way in the final
furlong. JOKER MATT , three wide stalking the embattled leaders, altered out near the quarter pole and weakened. JOHNNY DAR , hard sent from the gate,
sped to an early lead then relinquished that to EMPEROR'S CHOICE, stayed on to force the issue three wide outside that one through the backstretch run,
failed to keep pace nearing the lane and tired.
