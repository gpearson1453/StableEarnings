Footnotes
SUNDANCE FEATURE came away in good order, dueled along the inside, shook off BELLOFTHEBLUEGRASS leaving the turn, shook clear and drew
away to score with something left. THOUGHTFUL broke slow, was unhurried into stride, advanced between rivals through the turn, came three wide, tacked
to the inside and kept on well to garner the runner up spot. SALLY O'MALLEY dueled from the outside, was unable to go on with the winner leaving the turn,
weakened further in the drive and settled for the minor award. BELLOFTHEBLUEGRASS tracked three deep, shifted out five wide with a quarter to run, but
lacked the needed response when put to pressure. ROCK HARBOR settled in hand, ranged into striking distance four wide through the turn, but flattened in
the drive. FLAWLESS QUALITY was off a step slow, settled saving ground but failed to make headway. DESPO'S DREAM was forwardly placed along the
inside through the turn and tired. NAUGHTY MISS failed to respond. DOWHATEVERITTAKES settled off of the inside and was never a factor.

Footnotes
SIDAMARA stuttered half a step leaving the gates, settled well back two to three side, gained four wide around the far turn to bid outside of the leaders
entering the lane, drove clear in midstretch while drifting multiple paths outwardly, came back in while getting back to task and held sway. SEDONA raced
towards the rear in the two path, then five path around the far turn before fanning seven wide into the lane, rallied outside of foes to reach place at the wire.
PROMISEMEANEMPIRE tracked along the inside, split rivals to bid two wide entering the lane to bid along with a wider rival, got outkicked by that one
nearing midstretch and lost place late. LITTLE JAMIE was bumped, bothered, and forced outwardly by inner rivals into the first turn, trailed in the four path,
then two path around the far turn and stayed on willingly between horses. PRETTY ANA brushed an outer rival and sparked a chain reaction of trouble for
outer rivals into the first turn, tracked forwardly two wide and between horses, retreated nearing the half mile pole, chased in the three path around the far
turn, shifted to the five path and between horses entering the lane, then ran on mildly. AMERICA'S VOW took back from between horses early on, laid off of
the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four path and failed to menace. WEIGH THE RISKS vied along the inside, led around the far turn, but
proved no match for an outer pair in upper stretch and weakened. SING A LITTLE SONG vied two wide and faded between horses turning for home.
STANDOUTSENSATION pressed three deep and weakened between horses in upper stretch. WONDER RIDE transferred contact from an inner rival ton
an outer foe entering the first turn, pursued from midpack two wide, chase along the inside around the far turn and faded. BEFRIENDED was bumped by an
inner foe into an outer rival into the first turn, pursued from midpack four wide and outside of foes, then weakened.

Footnotes
STIR CRAZY was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, took closer order through the second turn, got through entering the stretch, altered out
near the furlong marker, split rivals and took dead aim on the leader, engulfed SULTRY LASS and quickly drew away. SULTRY LASS opened clear to set
the pace removed from the inside, widened leaving the second turn, drifted out further in the drive, churned on but was no match for the winner. SCHOOL
DANCE attended the pace along the inside, got through and boxed on but settled for the minor award. INTO DISCO chased four wide, was floated out
deeper in the upper stretch, and lacked the needed late response. MAKE THE BOYS WINK contended off of the inside, came three wide, but flattened
during the drive. EMBRACE ME settled in the second flight three wide and failed to respond. PAINT ME PERFECT was jostled early, saved ground and was
never a factor. BATUCADA was close up four wide to the second turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
OVA CHARGED brushed with an inner rival soon after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, rushed to duel for the lead with an outer rival, sparred taking the bend
a path off of the fence, got headed by her outer counterpart in upper stretch, fought back to lead once again nearing midstretch, then dug in tenaciously and
fended off a pair of late challengers. SECRET MONEY pursued from midpack along the inside, smoothly took aim between the leading pair in midstretch,
offered a bid in the final furlong but was kept at bay and held place. RUN FOR THE HILLS brushed with an outer rival soon after the start, trailed along the
inside before swinging to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied widest through the final furlong, edged show late and missed place at the wire. MEDALLA
MATCH laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path entering upper stretch, ran on between horses but got outkicked by an outer rival for
show. ELM DRIVE stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path, tipped to the four path and outside of them at the three sixteenths pole, forged
show once again while chasing the leaders into the final sixteenth, but yielded that position to a pair of outer rivals in the closing stages. TONY ANN
pursued from midpack two wide, shifted to the four to five path in upper stretch, but failed to menace. STONE SILENT dueled for the lead outside of the
eventual winner and from the three path around the turn, wrestled a narrow advantage entering upper stretch, but relinquished the front back to her inner
counterpart nearing midstretch and weakened between horses approaching the final sixteenth. MISS SPEEDY laid off of the pace along the inside while a
path off of the inner rail around the turn, then failed to factor.

Footnotes
FAST AS FLIGHT leaned into an outer rival at the start before being corrected with a strong left rein, stalked comfortably along the inside and from the
pocket, smoothly tipped off the rail to take aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, sustained slow progress to drive past that one at the sixteenth
pole, flopped back to her left lead and inched clear. SPARKLE BLUE settled well back two to three wide, fanned out to the six path entering upper stretch,
rallied to bid for place along with an outer rival in the final sixteenth, and narrowly prevailed. ASPEN GROVE (IRE) was bumped by an inner rival at the start,
then put to crowded quarters among foes early on, trailed into the first turn, took the far turn in the three path before swinging seven wide into upper stretch,
rallied widest to offer a late bid for place along with an inner foe, but missed that position. HEAVENLY SUNDAY dictated terms along the inside, shook free
entering the lane, held sway from an outer pursuer through midstretch, but was caught by that one at the sixteenth pole and yielded place to an outer pair in
the closing stages. PAPILIO (IRE) pursued from midpack two to three wide and between horses, steadied when blocked behind rivals in the five path in
upper stretch, managed to split foes at the furlong grounds and ran on well. FOREVER AFTER ALL steadied when put to crowded quarters among foes as
outer rivals crossed over early on, pursued from midpack along the inside, awaited racing room saving ground turning for home, sustained a rail chase
through midstretch, vacated the inside late but needed more between horses in the closing stages. SURPRISINGLY leaned out and bumped a rival while off
a step slow, settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, encountered mild traffic shifting from the four to
six path in upper stretch and moved up. MOUFFY tracked two to three wide and between horses, briefly encountered light traffic in upper stretch, chased
between horses into the final furlong, but flattened out without reaching contention. QUEENS COMMAND (IRE) laid off of the pace three to four wide around
the first turn, took closer order before chasing from midpack four deep around the far turn, drifted five wide entering the lane and tired. JOIN THE DANCE
took contact from an inner rival at the start, tugged subtly while forwardly placed early on, applied mild pressure two wide around both turns, but yielded
when floated three wide entering upper stretch and faded between horses. CAROLINE STREET staked four to three wide around the first turn, pursued four
wide and between horses into upper stretch, but weakened when put in a bit tight in midstretch.

Footnotes
MY MANE SQUEEZE settled in hand, ranged up four wide through the turn, came to level terms entering the stretch, shook clear and held sway. IMPEL
attended the pace off of the inside, took closer order through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run, kicked on well but was unable to bridge the gap.
ASTERNIA opened clear to dictate terms towards the inside, was collared leaving the turn and gave way once headed. HALINA'S FORTE tracked three
deep, bid between rivals leaving the turn, but flattened in the drive. DO GOODER was fractious in the gate, came away a beat slow, moved up five wide
through the turn, offered a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. LADY MOSCATO was unhurried off of the inside, finished with a belated improvement, but
failed to threaten. DENIM AND PEARLS settled between horses, was put in tight when ALL THINGS GO moved up between foes, brushed with that one
slightly, recovered quickly and advanced through the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch and failed to threaten. ACCOMMODATE EVA saved
ground to little avail. TANYA SHOWERS was allowed to settle, came under a ride midway through the turn, wheeled out eight wide but lacked the needed
response. ALL THINGS GO was unhurried into stride, moved up entering the turn, was caught in tight and brushed with DEMIN AND PEARLS near the
seven-sixteenths pole, lost position and showed little thereafter. R HARPER ROSE was close up three wide for a half and dropped out.

THORPEDO ANNA brushed with an inner rival leaving the gate, led inside of a pair of prompters early on, remained in hand as WAYS AND MEANS
sustained pressure around the far turn, shook clear of that one entering upper stretch as a wider JUST F Y I took aim, yet shifted out and edged further
away in the final furlong. JUST F Y I tracked the leaders from the three path early on, moved forward to stalk outside of the top pair around the far turn,
loomed a danger taking aim entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leader home while pulling clear of the rest to prove second best.
REGULATORY RISK brushed with an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked the main group from the three path while
traveling well around the far turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane and ran on willingly. WAYS AND MEANS prompted outside of the top pair and
from the four path around the first turn, sustained vying position tucking two wide around the far turn, but gave way between the eventual top pair entering
upper stretch, then lasted for fourth. EVERLAND pursued from midpack two wide, then three wide and among foes around the far turn, then stayed on.
POWER SQUEEZE lacked speed in the four to six path around the first turn and moved up. INTO CHAMPAGNE tucked while forwardly placed into the first
turn to stalk from the inside, but chased the leaders turning for home and faded. LEMON MUFFIN broke a step slow and was floated inwardly by an outer
rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, altered to the three path around the far turn, then improved between horses late.
TARIFA broke cleanly but was a touch slow into stride and ended up towards the rear early, resented kickback and got keen behind rivals through the lane
for the first time, laid off of the pace three wide before shifting to the five path entering the backstretch, got outmoved by a wider foe with three furlongs to
go, brushed an inner rival turning for home and failed to factor. WHERE'S MY RING broke half a step slow, saved ground off of the pace, steadied behind a
faltering foe at the three furlong pole, managed to slip inside of that one through very tight rail quarters turning for home, then lacked a bid. OUR PRETTY
WOMAN brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the six path around the fist turn, chased around the far turn and weakened. GIN GIN checked
back inside of rivals early on to trail the field, took the far turn in the five path and made little impact. LESLIE'S ROSE brushed with an outer rival at the tart,
stalked in the five path and weakened between horse around the far turn. FIONA'S MAGIC broke inwardly, vied two wide and between horses, but wilted
with three furlongs to go and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
ALMOSTGONE ROCKET broke sharp, settled off of the pace in hand, launched a sweeping move four wide through the turn, took over in the upper stretch
and kicked clear. MINK'S PALACE set the pressured pace toward the inside, fought on through a prolonged drive, was unable to resist the winner but
stayed on well for the place. TWEETSTER tracked three wide, shifted out five wide entering the stretch, lacked the needed punch but toiled on for the minor
award. HARBOR SPRINGS was unhurried, settled saving ground, got through but failed to make headway. PRINCESA CELINA settled between horses,
angled out leaving the turn, but failed to make headway. CHASING SPRING broke slow and never recovered. TWIRLING GOOD TIME disputed the pace
three wide, but faltered between horses entering the stretch and dropped out. SARATOGA SECRET showed little.
