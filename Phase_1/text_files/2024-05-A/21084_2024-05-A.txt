Footnotes
FRENCH HORN broke quickly into stride from the outer post to seize control, was unopposed setting the fractions on the fence around the turn and had
more left for the drive to keep rivals at bay. KOKOMO prompted the pace inside after the break, was reined back shifting just outside entering the turn,
chased the winner off the rail through the bend and was game down the lane never giving up, to clearly best the rest at the finish line. SEDBURYS GHOST
co-trailed this compact field down the backside on the rail, was urged between runners three wide maintaining position at the three furlong marker and won
the battle for show finishing up a non threatening third in the end. WAR SIGNAL broke in a bit of a tangle to co-trail on the outside down the backstretch,
made an early move four wide by mid-turn, was in the hunt for a better share at the top of the lane and had little finish to give, settling for a minor role at the
wire.

Footnotes
I'M TENACIOUS was unhurried near the back, began to pick up runners smartly four wide at the quarter pole and closed strongly under left handed
encouragemnet to run the leaders down with seventy yards to go. AMI'S GIRL was reluctant to load at the start, had a good spot outside horses watching
the engaged foursome up front at the half, made a good move circling around foes with five sixteenths to run, loomed in the two path in upper stretch and
stayed on to the wire just holding on to the place share. SILENT PATSY was brushed inside on the start, stalked near the rear down the backside, closed
the gap on the front runners four wide at the quarter pole, shifted inwards at the top of the stretch and ran on late to just miss closing in for second money.
GET MY DRIFT broke outwards to begin, prompted the pace four wide in the early stages, moved quickly three wide to take command with three furlongs to
go, opened up though the turn, was clinging to the lead with a furlong to go and was engulfed by rivals in deep stretch to settle for a minor role. ZODIAC
BEACH was void of speed to trail down the backstretch and through the turn, swung out sharply in the four path when coming up quickly on tiring rivals into
the stretch but could not get involved down the lane. GOINGTOARUBA chased in the two path between rivals down the back straight, could not maintain
forward position with seven sixteenths from home, was checked behind tiring foes in mid-turn and could not regroup to pose a threat in the stretch running.
NADEZHDA forced the issue in the three path with runners on each side in the early going, was roused to keep up on the turn, offered little response and
retreated with two furlongs left to go. COINS UNLIMITED was hustled on the rail to take the lead mid-backstretch, gave way on the rail up front with three
eighths to go and backed through the field on the fence at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SOL DE VERANO was away alertly to have the lead on the rail, set the pace while hounded outside by runners going around the bend, put away the early
challengers by the furlong pole and stubbornly dug in late to hold off the closing foe in deep stretch. ADMIRAL NELSON broke out sharply on the start, had
a good tracking position in midfield down the backside, patiently waited on the fence behind the trio of contesting runners throughout the turn, shifted just
outside finally getting a seam in the two path with a furlong to go and under a vigorous hand ride was gaining with every stride but just missed at the finish
line. ALTA CALIBRE co-trailed on the inside in the beginning, saved ground seeing the field on the turn, angled out to the three path for the drive, shifted
inwards off tiring horses by mid-stretch and picked up the pieces finishing with intent for a solid debut effort. BEDTIME was pushed out on the start,
regrouped to chase outside down the back straight, dueled between runners around the bend but flattened out with runners on ech side with a furlong to go.
COMMANDER WORSLEY co-trailed on the outside down the backstretch, made a menacing move three wide going around horses at the three furlong
marker, bid for the lead outside in the three path straightening for home, could not sustain the run and emptied at the furlong marker.

Footnotes
CLASSIC DANCER was bumped at the start but nevertheless quickly moved clear, dictated terms near the rail in a measured pace, was roused a bit in
upper stretch as a challenger pursued, had enough in reserve to hold sway under moderate urging. MOON LANDING tracked the loose leader and eventual
winner from inside till midway on the turn, moved out two wide and was put to urging just outside the quarter pole, could make no headway on the winner
but was second best. PRINCE OF AYRSHIRE was well-placed stalking outside foes just off the leader, raced three to four wide throughout, kept on well
enough to hold show honors but was no late threat to the top pair. GOOD RAPPORT settled off the pace, advanced outside four to five wide on the turn,
kept on in the lane but couldn't get to show honors while best of the rest. SIR SAMUEL was between runners off the pace, urged along three furlongs out
racing three wide, ran on. ENCHANT ME was outpaced in the early going bringing up the rear racing wide, shifted in about the half, saved ground early on
the turn, waited just very briefly nearing the three-eighths then moved out two to three wide after, failed to menace. YORKVILLE dropped back from
between runners near the three-eighths, fanned six wide for the drive, was never a threat. WILBERFORCE bumped a rival then steadied slightly at the start,
was urged forward between runners but a bit tentative while doing so when in just a bit tight, chased from between then faded.

Footnotes
CRIMINAL INTENT broke sharp taking control on the fence down the backside, dueled inside for the lead at the three furlong marker and stubbornly fought
to the wire never giving in and inched away for the victory nearing the wire. ITS TIME TO SHINE was off a bit slow on the start, under a snug hold prompted
the pace outside, engaged outside for the lead with three eighths to go and battled head and head with the winner to the finish, just giving way in deep
stretch. BUCK'S FIZZ had one foe beaten down the backside, tracked the contesting leaders five wide outside foes around the bend, was in the thick of
things in the five path turning for home, could not threaten the front two who had a race to themselves but did win the battle for show in the stretch. MYRA'S
BOY hopped on the break spotting the pack, made a strong move swooping around rivals five wide at the quarter pole, loomed boldly widest in the six path
at the top of the lane but could not go on and stalled in the last sixteenth for a minor share. THOR'S CAUSE stalked near the rear early on, was part of the
tracking bunch in the four path between horses with three furlongs to go, continued to rally to be in the mix four wide turning for home but could only finish
up evenly in the last furlong. THEFRONTIERSMAN was in tight leaving the chute and was checked, recovered to settle on the rail in midfield at the half,
waited on the fence behind horses when the field bunched up at the quarter pole but could not make any impression in the stretch running. BEARING
DOWN settled in mid-pack outside, closed the gap while in the second flight between horses in the three path on the turn but lacked a rally in the drive to
the finish line. CAUGHT SPEEDING was reluctant to load at the start, chased between foes down the back straight, could not quicken with others at the
three eighths pole and yielded in tight surroundings at the top of the stretch.

Footnotes
PIPER'S FACTOR settled mid-pack just off the pace two to three wide, began to advance when encouraged three deep at the three-eighths, drew even
making a bid at the five-sixteenths, took command at the top of the stretch, forged clear under steady and stout urging. FIGHTER IN THE WIN sped clear &
shifted in dictating terms near the rail, was challenged coming past the three-eighths, dueled inside the eventual winner, was no match but second best.
ROSCAR settled mid-pack inside, shifted out from two to four wide while launching a move late on the far turn, could not match strides with the top pair
chasing those two home. CUPID'S CLAWS tucked in saving some ground early on the first turn bringing up the rear, was guided out, received some light
brushes late up the backstretch, moved three then four wide on the far turn, swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch and was finishing strongly but too
late. CHAMBER MUSIC broke a step slowly, was a bit erratic entering the first turn veering out at the seven-eighths and steadying at that juncture, finally
settled down soon after racing at the back inside, saved ground early on the far turn still way back, angled five wide turning into upper stretch and beginning
to improve past runners, continued to pass some in the lane. WINSTON BLUE raced mid-pack mostly outside three to four wide, swung out five to six deep
for the drive, ran on evenly and made no bid. READ ON was urged from the start, chased from inside, came up empty. FLAWLESS RULER was carried six
wide by a drifting and erratic rival entering the first turn, brushed with a rival late up the backstretch, dropped back from between runners on the far turn,
angled nine wide turning for home, failed to rally. ARASHI broke a bit inwardly but quickly recovered, moved forward stalking three wide into the first turn
just off the leader, continued well-positioned till midway on the far turn, came up empty for the stretch.

Footnotes
TOUR THE CITY was unhurried to stalk on the outside along the backside, moved in on the leaders four wide circling horses, bid for the lead five wide in
mid-stretch and edged clear late under mild urging for the impressive score. ROLLING ALONG had a good spot tracking the dueling pair three wide outside
at the half, bid for the lead outside at the top of the stretch, assumed command in the four path with a furlong remaining but was no match for the winner
nearing the finish. LEGAL CATCH pressed the pace between foes down the back straight, weakened up top on the rail at the three furlong pole to be a
chasing challenger on the turn, shifted out in the three path with a furlong to go and re-rallied late for a share of third money at the wire. JESSAMINE HILL
broke a step slow at the start, pulled the rider down the backstretch to track inside by the half mile marker, shifted out to the two path lengthening stride at
the quarter pole, was then steadied sharply on the fence behind a tiring rival at the eighth pole and ran on mildly to share the show award. MO' SPRESSO
had a slow start to begin, stalked between foes near the rear at the half, saved ground on the turn and finished up willingly down the stretch. LUCKY
ROMANCE was allowed to settle at the back with four furlongs remaining, could not get involved running around the oval and passed a tired rival in the
stretch. BOURBON NORTH had the lead under a tight hold down the backside, started to inch away up top at the three furlong marker, was collared outside
by runners at the top of the lane, drifted inwards at the furlong pole and stopped on the fence in deep stretch. COPROLITE was in the mix early on up front
running on the fence, at the half was shuffled back on the rail, lost touch travelling through the turn and was eased through the stretch

Footnotes
FABLED PRINCE was content to track the pacesetter at the half, begun to reel in the lone speed comfortably by the quarter pole and when set down drew
off convincingly in deep stretch. POSTURING travelled on the rail in mid-pack down the backside, was asked for more on the rail at the quarter pole and ran
to the finish besting the rest at the wire behind a dominant winner. WAR STRATEGY was checked in tight surroundings soon after the break to trail, started
to pick up runners outside midpoint on the turn and was full of run down the stretch to just miss out for the place share at the wire. COHERENCE stalked
outside in the early going, rallied at the quarter pole three wide closing the gap on the leaders, angled out to the six path turning for home and finished up
mildly to settle on the fringes. ROAD TO VERSAILLES took control from the onset, dictated the pace unopposed at the half, was headed outside by the
winner at the quarter pole and wilted on the fence in deep stretch. CALUSA DONNIE had one beaten down the backside, could not get interested going the
wrong way throughout the turn and passed a tiring runner in the final sixteenth. GEM QUALITY settled on the outside in mid-pack down the backside, was
roused three wide at the quarter pole to be in the hunt for a small share at the top of the lane, could not find more for the drive and stopped in the final
furlong. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 WAR STRATEGY REGARDING THE START OF THE RACE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

MAXIMUS MOMENTUS was away slowly on the break, advance smartly on the fence when asked three furlongs out, swung out with good momentum four
wide at the top of the lane and was reaching for more ground to get up just in time for the score. SEA TO AIR emerged from the foursome to get loose on
the lead entering the turn, opened up while in hand going around the oval, continued to take the field through the stretch but was caught just before the wire
by the fast closing winner. COMMANDER JOE had a good trip all alone watching the quartet up front in the early going, moved up on the inside by the three
eighths marker, loomed in the four path at the top of the lane, drifted in when asked driving to the wire in mid-stretch and settled for a non threatening but
clear third in the end. SUNSPEAR was part of the foursome battling up front in the four path outside horses in the beginning, then was taken back entering
the turn to smartly saving ground getting to the fence with five sixteenths to go and closed in on the rail turning for home but evened out the final furlong.
CHANCEL was part of the early mix in the two path with rivals on both sides, chased the loose frontrunner outside with three furlongs to go, was in tight
quarters battling for the place share at the time between horses in the two path at the eighth pole, was checked and could not recover in time to threaten.
JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE settled on the rail near the back, could not improve while under a ride going around the bend and lacked a bid running to the wire.
JUST START ME UP trailed outside down the back straight, could not close the gap on runners throughout the turn and made little presence in the stretch
drive. RELOAD BULLET was part of the early speed duel in the three path at the beginning, tracked the top pair into the first turn, was asked for more run
mid-turn, could not go on and backed away outside by the quarter pole. STEWARDS GENERAL INQUIRY AT THE FURLONG MARKER RESULTED IN
