PLEASANT EMBRACE veered in leaving the gate, recovered to duel on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and held clear to the
finish. HOPESNDREAMS bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in
the three path and chased on in the lane. GLORIOUS LADY bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, tracked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and kept on from there. AMIRATI raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the turn from the
three path and never threatened. CHIEF LADY dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and faded in the
stretch. PAPAISICE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the four path and made no bid.
