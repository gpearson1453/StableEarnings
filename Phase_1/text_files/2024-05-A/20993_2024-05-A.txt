Footnotes
BULLEIT ROCKS set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn and held under urging. PREDICTING was off a step slowly, stalked the pace, rallied on the
turn, went willingly to the wire, couldn't gain ground and finished second best. RAINBOW SMILES was never far back, put in a steady effort and was along
for show. OH MY GAWD pressed the pace along the rail, fell back on the turn and came up empty late.

LAPIS LAZULI stalked the pace along the inside, shifted out on the turn, bid willingly to challenge three across, dueled for the lead and proved best.

sixteenth pole and held safely for show. BOX SEAT was slow early, advanced inside on the turn, angled out, went widest in the drive, offered a mild bid and
failed to menace. CAPTAIN DOZER showed speed to the turn and stopped.

narrow the gap while no match for the winner. GOSPEL FABULOUS was unhurried early and trailed the field, swung wide entering the stretch to be widest
in the drive and closed well to earn show. GOTTA SEE RED broke slowly, swung wide entering the stretch and didn't have enough left in a steady effort. DO
YOU BILEVE chased the pace, was carried out entering the stretch, tired and gave way. DOUDOUDOUWANADANCE chased the pace, angled out into the

Footnotes
I'M ALIVE bumped start, pressed the pace three wide, rallied leaving the turn, closed steadily, inched clear past the eighth pole and held well. DIAMONDS
R LUCKY raced close to the pace towards the outside, rallied four wide on the turn, closed steadily and was outfinished in a good effort. LEGEND'S
JOURNEY was hustled along, vied to the turn, inched away for a short lead, was outclosed and held for show. ABES DAY broke out and bumped at the
start, was void of early speed, swung wide into the stretch and finished well. E D'ORO bid off the rail in tight quarters leaving the turn to get within range and
hung late. STORMSACOMIN broke awkwardly, lagged early, offered a mild bid only and failed to menace. TAKING ENERGY stalked the pace, fell back into
the stretch, weakened and faded. MAJESTIC FLASH vied inside to the turn and gave way. GOSPEL FOREST was not a factor.
