Footnotes
MR. SHORTY led the way while two wide, then drew clear on the turn and was ridden out to the wire to prove much the best. CAPOTE'S GLITTER saved
ground while racing towards to back, came out four wide to rally in the stretch but it was to no avail. TOOTHMAN chased the pace while two wide, gained
second position leaving the turn, could not catch the cleared leader and was out finished for the place prize in the end. LONE TREE chased the pace from
the inside at a moderate pace throughout and was no rally in the end. GIVE HIM TIME lunged at the start, was out run and passed tired foe in the end.
IMPOVERISHED pressed the pace from the inside early, then settled back on the turn and continued to fade in the final furlongs.

in the late stretch and lasted to the wire. PATRIOT HILLS bumped rival at the start, then tracked the pace from the two path down the backstretch, was in a
steady drive then was in tight on the far turn, shifted inward heading into the stretch, dug in gamely but could not catch the leader in the end. MACHO
GRANDE bumped rival at the start, was allowed to settle while two wide in the back duo, bid while four wide on the far turn to rally mildly in the stretch and
was up for third position. YOUNG POPE was allowed to settle along the inside, then bid on the far turn while three wide to menace at the top of the stretch
and came up empty in the end. BISHOP CREEK tucked along the rail while racing at the back, then bid mildly and the far turn and did not spark in the
stretch. MIND HUNTER exchanged the lead with an inner rival in the early furlongs, dropped back to second position while urging steadily on the far turn
then flattened out in the home stretch. DARK RUM chased the pace from the inside close behind the leaders in the early backstretch, then faded on the far

TIFFANY TWIST stalked the pace while two wide into the turn, then inched up to confront the leader at the quarter pole, sparred in an all out drive down the
lane and was up in time to prevail. RANEEM emerged from the pack to set the pace while two wide into the turn, then was confronted by an outer rival to
duel in the stretch and just missed victory in the end. OLIVIA G stalked the pace from inside, then lost ground on the turn, re bid in the upper stretch to gain
third position while drifting out and was best for the show prize. BLAMEITONMIDNIGHT was unhurried early, bid while three wide on the turn and did not fire
in the stretch. RECLUSIVE trailed at the back and failed to menace. GEMSTONE GAL bid for the lead from the inside, then pressed the emerging leader

Footnotes
SHELL SHOCK laid off the pace while four wide down the backstretch, inched up on the turn, dug in gamely to gain command at the eighth pole and held
sway till the end. ROZEY CHEEKS saved ground while trailing behind the field down the backstretch, swung seven wide leaving the bend and closed well
late to be up for the place prize. TEXAS RED BEL tracked the pace while two wide and in a steady drive, then rallied gamely leaving the bend, was in
contention for the lead, lacked the final spark and was out finished by outer foes in the end. BASKET CASE chased the pace from the inside, settled back
heading into the turn, then came out three wide, was bumped by an inner rival at the top of the stretch and kept on in the final yards. PUT A BOW ON IT
was off slowly, then moved up in the late backstretch while four wide, bid on the turn in the stretch and kept on while in a mild drive but it was to no avail.
WA WA WEE WA stalked the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, bid mildly in the stretch and came up empty. SIMPLE PLEASURE was allowed to
settle along the inside down the backstretch, then menaced on the turn and into the stretch and was no threat. SALTAMONTES DIVA vied briefly with outer
foes before taking command at the six, lead the way into the turn then was over powered by rivals from both sides heading into the stretch and gave way in
the end. SHINING EXAMPLE chased the pace while two wide down the backstretch and into the turn, then lugged out and bumped rival in the early stretch
and lost momentum after.

throughout the turn and into the stretch, was in strong drive throughout and hung at the wire. IOWA HAWKEYE chased the pace while two wide, then rallied
leaving the turn, gained third position while drifting inward and did not have enough to close in on the leaders and was best for show. CLASSIC RUNNER
vied between rivals down the backstretch, then settled back to third position on the turn, then was floated inwardly by drifting rival in the late stretch and was
out finished for the show prize. KEEPMOVINGFORWARD settled at the back of the field, then bid between rivals leaving the bend to rally mildly in the
stretch but it was too little too late. CAPTAINS COVE chased the pace from the inside, then bid on the turn and came up flat in the stretch and was no
threat. SAMSPLAYERSLOUNGE chased the pace while three wide at an even pace throughout and needed rally. KENTUCKY BOURBON refused to start.

Footnotes
AVALING laid off the pace while being nicely rated along the inside, then bid boldly on the the turn, came out three wide to close well in the late stretch and
was up in time to prevail. ALL AMERICAN LADY battled for the lead from the inside, gained command at the top of the turn, was in a long drive in the late
stretch then was caught when it mattered most. BLUEBONNET GIRL chased the pace while three wide, was in a steady drive throughout the bend,
menaced in the early stretch and was best for the show position. MIZZ FACTOR vied for the lead while four wide, could not take command while urging
eagerly on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. DIVERTIDA settled along the inside early, then rallied mildly leaving the turn and came up empty in the
stretch. INDY LA PRIMERA bid for the lead between rivals before settling back to chase the pace while two wide, was in tight at the three eighths marker,
dropped back and lacked responding in the final yards. BUBBLES AND BLING vied for the lead between rivals, continued to press the emerging leader
throughout the turn while two wide, could not gain command and gave way in the stretch. ALONG CAME THUNDER chased the leaders from the inside
down the backstretch, was in mild drive on the far turn, came out five wide to bid in the stretch and made no impact. TAPS MISTRESS vied for the lead
while three wide down the backstretch, was in a hard drive throughout, was used up on the turn then weakened in the stretch. TERE'SDRAMAQUEEN
settled at the back after the first few furlongs and failed to menace. LAVENDER WILL drifted inward at the start and failed to rally.

Footnotes
SHARP SPARK was allowed to settle in the back flight while three wide, then moved up to bid from the inside on the far turn, came out three wide to spar
with IN FORM in the final yards and was up at the wire to prevail. IN FORM chased the pace from the inside in the first flight of rivals, gained command at
the top of the far turn, then was challenged by SHARP SPARK from the outside, to duel gamely in the stretch and hung in the end. CISCO KID drifted out
early, then set the pace from the inside down the backstretch, was in a long drive heading into the far turn, was over taken for the lead at the five sixteenths
pole, then gave way in the stretch while maintaining the show position in the end. DARING REASON pursued the pace between rivals in the first flight, then
bid in close for the lead on the far turn, could not over take the inner rivals and gave way in the home stretch. GWYNETH'S MALIBU was allowed to settle in
the back trio while two wide, then bid on the far turn and was no threat. FLYING J RAGNAR tucked along the inside in the back flight of rivals and was no
menace. PEARSE chased the pace while three wide in the first flight of rivals, urged eagerly in attempt to keep up on the far turn, could not retain bid and
flattened out late. TEXAS REIGN was fractious in the gate, was out run and no factor.
