BISCAYNE BAY sprinted up the inside to make the lead entering the clubhouse turn, set all the pace, drifted out in front of the runner up when put to left
handed urging nearing the furlong marker and just lasted. POWER BANKER pressured the winner two wide into the stretch, was shut off near the furlong
marker causing her rider to check then came on again gamely through the final stages and just missed. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT never far back, found her
best stride late in the four path. OUT FOR FUN well placed, went evenly. CATABOUT close up through the first turn, dropped back and trailed. THE

Footnotes
MOESTER allowed to settle, closed willingly four wide under left handed urging to make the lead near mid stretch and finished full of run to win going away.
OKLAHOMA JOE never far back, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole then was no match for the winner. EXCITEMENT settled near mid pack
and found his best stride late four wide. THAT'S THE WAY bumped at the start and rallied belatedly three wide. REINVESTEDINTEREST had good early
speed along the inside and two wide then failed to respond. RELISH THE RIDE slow early, passed tiring rivals through deep stretch. MANGA MAN was no
factor. THEDAYOFTHEGREY pressed the pace along the inside into the turn, gained a slight lead briefly, remained a sharp threat past the furlong marker
then came up empty. PROSECUTOR bumped at the start, sped to the lead three wide, set the pace for nearly a half then weakened late. DANEFIELD was
no threat. MISTER MOBIL bumped at the start and was outrun. FIRST SONG pressed the early pace three wide then two wide and was through after a half.
