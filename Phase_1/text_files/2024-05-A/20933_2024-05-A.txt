Footnotes
JULYNNE moved off the rail some trying to gain a clear path soon after the break, waited from inside on the bend, got through along the rail entering the
lane, moved clear inside the last eighth and held sway. BIG SALLY broke on top then steadily angled inward, was challenged from outside on the turn then
from both sides upper stretch and gradually wore down. CANDY LOOKER vied for the early lead, was checked and altered out when BIG SALLY took her
path just past the five-furlong pole, came again to that one two wide on the bend, dueled through the stretch but did not have enough left in the late going.
GHALY POSSE prominent from outside from the beginning, began to wear down and lug in deep stretch. SHINE DOWN fractious in the gate, was
unprepared to start with the rest when the gate opened, left well behind the others, galloped around the track and finished in hand. There was a stewards'
inquiry into SHINE DOWN'S start and an objection was lodged by the rider of CANDY LOOKER claiming interference from BIG SALLY after travelling the
first eighth. After their review, SHINE DOWN was deemed unprepared to start and declared a non-starter for pari-mutuel purposes only. The stewards
disqualified BIG SALLY for interference to CANDY LOOKER and placed her third.

TROUBLE FINDS ME shared the lead outside LIFE OF SATURDAYS, was carried out some by that one into the lane then gradually opened up under
urging to be clearly best. LIFE OF SATURDAYS vied for the lead just off or along the rail, was no match for TROUBLE FINDS ME when set down for the
drive but was unchallenged for second. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE raced in contention off the inside on the backstretch, saved ground through the bend then
gradually angled out as she pulled away for the show through the stretch. BEIRUT BEAUTY well placed from inside, angled out some taking the turn then
faded for the drive. PRINCESS MANDII hesitated, broke a bit outward, was then checked behind traffic and never a factor.

Footnotes
ONE WAY HOME stalked the early speed in hand, was let out to advance two wide nearing the end of a half mile, drew clear on the second turn, was put to
urging leaving that bend, widened command under a drive then was allowed to coast the final forty yards. BOURBON DELIGHT soon took the lead from
outside, moved to the rail into the backstretch, was challenged nearing the end of a half mile, no match for ONE WAY HOME, came off the rail some into the
stretch then battled inside DRIFTING WEST for second. DRIFTING WEST progressed to contention from outside on the backstretch, was two then three
wide taking the second bend, fought BOURBON DELIGHT for second in the lane but did not have enough left in the waning yards. KEEN RESPONSE
jostled by COPPER CROSSING at the break, showed a willingness to run through the stretch and passed between tired ones. READY REDDING in
contention early three wide, saved ground taking the second turn then flattened out the final furlong. COPPER CROSSING was bumped, forced in some
then jostled between rivals, chased from well off the inside and failed to menace. LOOK AWAY broke inward, jostled with COPPER CROSSING, soon
trailed, saved ground and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BILL'S HONOR broke in stride, showed the way just off the rail then drew away as much the best through the stretch. FAST CROSS TRAFFIC prominent
behind BILL'S HONOR early, progressed just outside the latter on the bend, took over second upper stretch then could only just hold his position late.
EMPTY HOLSTER raced in contention from inside, advanced just off the rail through the turn, altered out four wide at the top of the lane for a clear path and
was closing in on FAST CROSS TRAFFIC as he drew away for the show. JACK SPRAT forwardly placed on the backstretch, lost ground four then five wide
taking the bend and had no stretch rally. MAJESTIC ATTACK was well placed along the rail for a half mile then began to yield. AFTER MY BROTHER
pressed the early pace then gave way widest on the turn.

Footnotes
DENNIS'S PRIDE moved clear of the rest after a half furlong, showed the way in hand, was let out leaving the bend, opened up under a drive in the stretch
and proved much the best while kept to task. STANCE in contention early between rivals, took the rail entering the lane, progressed in tight quarters inside
HAND OVER MY HEART and gained second nearing the sixteenth pole. BEST MAN SPEECH was soon well back and inside, picked up his pace leaving
the turn, altered out between rivals for a clear path just inside the eighth pole, closed well and gained third late. HAND OVER MY HEART prominent from
inside, was boxed in on the bend, gained a clear path just off the rail into the stretch then ran evenly the rest of the way. DOUBLE DRIBBLE pressed the
leader from just outside, floated out some into the lane, was no match for DENNIS'S PRIDE and gradually wore down deep stretch. ZEE FIRE without early
speed, was just off the inside taking the bend, fanned out some for the drive, also altered out just after entering the final furlong and showed a willingness to
run late. C C RITHMS was hustled along to prompt the pace between horses but began to yield two wide on the turn. OSCAR NOMINEE hesitated at the
break, was rushed up from outside then faded three wide on the bend.

GHAALEB'S HONOR bumped from the rear at the break, pressed I LUV THIS BAR from just outside, edged ahead from path three upper stretch and held
on under steady handling. FREE LOVE broke inward, bumping GHAALEB'S HONOR, chased from outside, lost ground five wide through the turn, was
blocked behind JOLIE RULER upper stretch, gained a clear path with a furlong to go, closed well but narrowly missed. AWESOME SUNDAY forwardly
placed between rivals, did not keep up two wide on the bend, her rider lost his crop at the top of the lane, gained a clear path three wide upper stretch and
also rallied a bit too late in the waning yards. JOLIE RULER prominent toward the outside from the beginning, was four wide on the turn, drifted out briefly
midstretch and finished evenly. CANTOO fractious in the gate, raced in contention from inside once the race began, loomed a serious threat with a furlong
to go but leveled off in the late going. I LUV THIS BAR soon had a clear lead, showed the way just off the inside but gave way between rivals for the drive.

W W HOTSHOT broke on top then was hustled clear and to the inside, roused again upper stretch, widened his lead, was kept to task and clearly the best.
W W CANDY advanced from inside on the turn, came off the rail some for a clear path upper stretch, took over second inside the final eighth but could not
close the gap on the leader. STALLONE pressed W W HOTSHOT from just outside, did not keep up as he floated out some entering the stretch, gradually
wore down the last furlong but was easily best of the others. PAPA ROCKET reached contention three wide on the turn then flattened out for the drive.
AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) was an early factor from outside but faded two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
SIRCORRI was kept close first between horses then from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, angled in some as he engaged ROAD GAME at the
top of the stretch, battled that one then shook free inside the final sixteenth. ROAD GAME shared the lead from between rivals, moved ahead two wide on
the turn, took the rail at the top of the lane and slowly wore down deep stretch. PEACOCK MAN raced in contention while toward the outside on the
backstretch, progressed between horses on the bend, fanned outside SIRCORRI into the stretch, moved clear for third then leveled off the last furlong.
MEDAL OF FACT vied for the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the turn, angled out four wide midstretch for a clear path and finished evenly.
STOSH chased from inside, altered out for racing room upper stretch, lost his path to MEDAL OF FACT, altered inside that one after entering the final
eighth and also finished evenly. CHARM THE LADIES progressed three wide on the bend, fanned out some into the lane, altered out as MEDAL OF FACT
came out midstretch, lacked a rally and moved inside the latter in the waning yards. PERFECT WAGER saved ground and only passed a couple tired rivals
late. GREAT PLAINES was hustled along to dispute the pace from outside, was three wide on the turn, then gave way from between horses after a half
mile. TIZRIK raced in the second flight between foes on the backstretch but gave way along the rail on the bend.
