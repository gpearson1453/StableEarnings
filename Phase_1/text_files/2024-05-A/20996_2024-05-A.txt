LAURI'S WISH dueled on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kicked clear in the stretch. B MINOR raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside early, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and improved position to the finish. PESO PESADO raced off the pace up
the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. CRIMSON STORM stalked the
leader on the outside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the two path and chased on in the lane. DREWMAZING chased the leader
between horses up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path and gave way in the final furlong. COPTER dueled on the inside through the
opening stages, saved ground around the turn and faded in the stretch. JOLLY TOMMY tracked the leader on the inside early, continued around the turn in
the two path and faded in the lane. JAX MAN was away from the gate slowly, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the
three path and weakened from there. CALIBRACHOA KID dueled between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and tired in the
stretch. KENTUCKY PEERLESS trailed the field throughout, continued around the turn in the two path and was not a factor.
