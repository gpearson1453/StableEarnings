Footnotes
GHOZ ON dueled between foes in the three path and drove clear in the lane. SHILOH vied in the four path and kept on outside of the winner to be clearly
second best. MAS VINO raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was up for the show on the wire. SAND WEDGE
dueled inside of the top two finishers in the two path and weakened through the stretch. LADY OAKRIDGE chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid.
WHATS UP BUTTERCUP played no factor while racing four wide. BLACK AND SILVER broke a bit awkwardly and was outrun while racing two and three
wide.

FRANK JR stalked in the three path, bid two wide midway around the far turn, took command while being coaxed from the three path into the lane, drifted
out in the final sixteenth, but held sway. SIR MENDEL bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the two path, was roused into the far turn, swung from
the four path into the stretch, and ran on for place. EVERY FOUR YEARS showed the way in the two path, was coaxed along the rail early around the far
turn, but lost the lead passing the quarter, and evened out for show. RAGS SPECIAL tracked in the four path but never threatened. WILD CHARM bumped
with an inner foe at the start and trailed throughout.

four path into the stretch, continued to draw clear in upper stretch, and held sway. TITAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, then got keen in the two
path rounding the first turn, laid up close in the three path down the backside, came under a ride passing the three-eighths, floated out to the six path at the
top of the lane, and chased on for place. KUWAIT TOWERS tracked in the two path, was ridden into the far turn, and finished evenly for show. MACASSAR
bumped between foes at the start, chased inside but made no impact from the five path in the stretch. BUILDER JAK hopped at the start, rated in the four
path but did not factor from the six path down the lane. BREATH DEEPLY had awkward start, raced wellback in the five path and never threatened. BIG
SENSE stalked in the five path but backed up early around the far turn.

DE REGRESO saved ground off early pace, made progress between foes down the backstretch, continued to gain three wide around the far turn, seized
command in midstretch and drew off under a drive. STORMCAST was hard held up close three wide, took the lead turning for home, was no match for the
winner in the final furlong but held clear of the rest. ZO LEE settled off the early pace two wide, continued in midpack while racing four wide around the far
turn and ran on to gain the show late. DAZZLING MOVE raced in range at the rail, had a clear path through the lane but weakened. WELCOME BACK
raced well back four wide around the first turn, angled to the rail down the backstretch and improved position inside in the lane. MOJAVE DESERT set the
pace inside and tired in the drive. SHOW OFF failed to menace while racing three and four wide. NEW DIAMOND played no factor while racing three wide.
DESTINY STAR was outrun while racing five wide around both turns. KARAYA pressed the pace two wide and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

FOUNDER'S DAY prompted the pace in the three path, bid under rousing passing the quarter, took command while being cued from the five path at the top
of the stretch, inched clear around the sixteenth, and held sway. GITANA bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path, was coaxed along
in the four path around the turn, and ran on from the six path down the lane for place. MOUNT SINAI tracked in the two path, was roused midway around
the turn, and finished evenly from the four path in the stretch for show. SIX FEET APART showed the way in the two path, was roused nearing the quarter,
but faded in the stretch. LOVE PARADOX bumped with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout.

KING D'ORO saved ground off the pace, angled three wide in midstretch, kicked in between foes and was up late. DEVILMENT set the pace along the rail,
dug in inside of foes in the lane, held off all pace rivals but was unable to resist the winner late. ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT pressed the pace two wide, battled
through the lane but was outfinished. SOUPER ATTENTIVE raced in range two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. YANKEE DRUMMER raced off
the pace two and three wide, angled further out in upper stretch and had a mild belated rally. OUT OF BOUNDS was off a step slow, raced off the pace two
and three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. NOBLE TIGER stalked the pace from the rail and was blocked
throughout the final furlong. LINESMAN had his head turned at the start, saved ground and never threatened.

PEOPLE FORCE laid up close in the three path, was coaxed into the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, kicked on, and drew past the inner
pacesetter late. SWAN LAKE showed the way in the two path, was cued passing the three-eighths, inched clear from the two path in upper stretch, but was
caught by an outer foe late to place. HONESTO hopped at the start, rated in the five path, was driven in the six path around the far turn, floated out to the
eight path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. UNCLE ARMANDO bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was coaxed into
the far turn, but made no impact along the inside down the lane. THE BEST DISTANCE prompted the pace along the rail but faded from the two path in the
stretch. BACKWOODS BOOGIE stalked in the four path, was driven between foes around the far turn, but flattened. HARTSBEATLIKTHUNDR chased in
the four path, was driven in the five path around the far turn, but weakened. READYSEEKGO raced wellback in the four path and never threatened from the
seven path in the stretch. BURNING MAN bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the five path and never menaced. KITTEN'S SPA raced off the

GRAND JOURNEY set the pace along the rail, drew off under solid hand urging in upper stretch and held well clear while geared down the late. ARTEMUS
BRIDGE saved ground off the pace, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. VALENTINE BUG saved ground in range, could not
gain under urging around the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole and was along for the show. DESOLATOR bumped with TIZ A PRINCE at the start,
raced two wide in midpack and lacked the needed rally. TIZ A PRINCE bumped at the start, was pulling early, chased the pace three wide and lacked a
closing bid. COACH ABERNATHY trailed in the two path, swung six wide in upper stretch and was no threat. GENTLEMAN GERRY prompted the winner
two wide and faltered in the drive.

the far turn but was one-paced through the lane. DANCING GROOM raced well back two wide, steadied near the quarter pole, swung six wide in upper
stretch and was no threat. EHSAAN trailed inside, swung widest in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. TIME SONG bumped at the start, had early speed
between foes, rated back angled in early on the first turn, raced up close inside and faded in the lane. BRAWN chased the pace two and three wide and
