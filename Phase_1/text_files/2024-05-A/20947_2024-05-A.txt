Footnotes
COMMUNICATION MEMO lacked early foot, raced in the two path through the turn, rallied through traffic stretch, up in time outside the late leader. GOOD
HEART dueled up front in the two path, shook clear of the other speed past the furlong marker, could not contain the winner in the final strides, held the
place. HOLDING PATTERN void of speed, raced four wide out of the turn when beginning to advance, rallied for the show and finished up willingly. FULL
AUTHORITY settled off the early speed and the inside, second flight in the two path turn, lacked a serious closing response. LUV TO WIN away with the
leaders, alternated up front while along the inside, first to blink in upper stretch, continued to weaken the final furlong. STARBURST with the main group in
the run up the backstretch inside, fell back through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. LORD GRANTHAM in the second flight
while racing outside, steadily faded. VERB in mid pack along the inside for a half, backed up through the stretch to trail home.

Footnotes
PINELAND off a step slow, moved up behind the leaders late backstretch, brief wait in traffic late turn in the two path, moved inside for the drive, rallied,
moved out slightly to engage the leader late, wore that one down under brisk handling. BOLD D'ORO away in good order, set a pressured pace along the
inside, shook clear when straightened for home,maintained a daylight advantage until caught late. HAILSTORM prompted the pace three wide for a half,
stalled in some traffic upper stretch, came back for the show late while not a threat to the top pair. REMARKABLE MO off a step slow, raced back and
outside, four wide through the turn, improved position slightly while also not a serious threat. CATALINA CRUSH hesitated at the break to be off slowly,
moved up to mid pack, went one paced in lacking a closing kick. MISCHIEVOUS M pressed the runner up for a half from the outside, gave way in some
traffic turning for home. GIMMEETHREESTEPS remained back in failing to threaten. HIGH RANSOM finished early, far back, jogged in well beaten.

Footnotes
FIGHT'N READY forwardly placed early along the inside, fell back the middle half while continuing outside, steered out a bit late in the final turn, three wide
bid late, up in time. GLUCKSTADT five wide through the first turn, moved closer on the outside into the far turn, dueled into the lane, gained the advantage,
could not hold the winner safe late while between horses, narrowly saved the second spot. HOLUS BOLUS broke on top, showed the way into the first turn
three wide, got to the inside backstretch, responded when the runner up challenged late in that bend, dueled, also could not contain the winner late, proved
stubborn for the place. DELUCA in mid pack along the inside early, two path far turn, dropped to the rail into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a
closing punch. HESS steadied in traffic the opening sixteenth, settled off the pace and the inside, three wide turning for home, also lacked a serious closing
response. CONTRABANDISTA off a step slow, raced back and inside, steered out to be three wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally, to improved position
a bit. HARD TO COME BY void of speed off the rail, four wide late in the final turn when still able to see them all, passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a
threat. POINT BLANK prompted the issue up front off the inside for five furlongs and began to give way. CORKED in mid pack early, four wide first turn,
tired from those efforts. REDFIELD steadily faded, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
AZTEC FIRE never back while racing outside, advanced in the three path to challenge late in the final turn, took over when straightened for home, quickly
drew out under token pressure to win ridden out. TELL 'EM I'M COMIN back off the pace toward the inside early, angled out three wide when advancing late
in the final bend, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS broke back, remained devoid of speed for six
furlongs, two path into the lane, improved through traffic to be along for the show, no match top pair. DIOMEDES broke well, set the pace along the inside,
continued to hold the advantage into the far turn, weakened when headed by the winner into the stretch, continued to give way to the wire. SNOW KING
forwardly placed while racing three wide, came up empty for the drive. YOU'RE ON MUTE void of speed inside early, swung out to be five wide turning for
home, improved position with some mild late interest. KENNEL CLUB went one paced throughout while racing three wide. PARISIAN PROMISE in hand
and forwardly placed along the inside, tired while continuing to save ground. VICTORY DASH off a step slow, was used to move up four wide in the first
turn, forced the pace up the backstretch and through the final turn, faltered final furlong. SATURDAY STARTER in mid pack and in the two path through the
first turn, began to waken in the second turn. MALINALCO hesitated at the break to be off slow, remained always back, jogged in. MO MESA stopped after
a half, far back while also jogging across the finish line.

Footnotes
GREATHEART allowed the pace to go early, made a solid move to challenge late in the final turn, extended drive outside rival, fully extended to prove best.
JEWELSTOWN prompted the pace off the inside, moved to challenge three wide second turn, put that pair of rivals away, dueled with the winner past the
furlong marker and proved stubborn to the end. NIP N TUCK in tight at the start, in some traffic near the back first turn, lagged up the backstretch, made a
good gain along the inside late in the second bend, split foes a furlong out and was up late for the show. COLOSI off a step slow, lacked speed as a result,
came three wide into the lane and improved position with some mild late interest. CHAOS REIGNS broke well from the outside, cleared toward the rail into
the first turn, vied up front just off the inside, allowed a foe the inside before a half, headed by that one, continued to vie second turn then weakened when
turning for home. DEVIL VISION hesitated at the break, four wide in the first turn when back, continued to lack speed, three to four wide second turn, lacked
a rally in the drive. THREEFIFTYSEVEN boxed in along the rail late in the first turn, moved up inside the winner to put a head in front before a half, vied
along the rail into the far turn, gave way in the drive. RISK PROFILE went one paced three wide to also lack a closing response. NAMESAKE lacked speed,
steered out around a stricken foe late first turn, continued well wide, five to six wide far turn, remained back in lacking a rally. BIZZY LEGS raced in mid pack
and outside, five wide midway on the final turn when between horses, failed to muster a rally. KOWBOYKABIN tired while four wide through most of the final
turn. WINDCRACKER shortened stride late in the first turn, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
HONEST OPINION in the second flight while racing outside, began to rally four wide late in the turn, kicked down the leader inside the furlong marker and
continued with good energy to the wire to win going away. STRING THEORY with the pace from the start, shook clear along the inside early in the turn,
continued to hold a daylight advantage through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner late, clearly second best. MY BROTHER MIKE broke back,
lacked speed off the inside, came five wide out of the turn, turned in a mild rally down the middle of the strip to be along for the show. NO MO WHINING in
mid pack off the inside, three wide late in the turn, improved position through upper stretch then flattened out late to lose the show. PREPAREDNESS back
off the pace, in some traffic entering the turn, steadied, came three wide for the drive, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. STORM CAT EYES
forwardly placed while racing three wide, weakened. PALMETTO DEVIL in the second flight early along the inside, one paced in the two path through the
turn, had little for the drive. SPEAKING LOUD forwardly placed outside, four wide far turn, tired. STATLER fractious in the gate prior to the start, was not
involved while three to four wide turn. XKUZ pressed the issue up front between foes in the early going, gave way before a half. CADILLAC COWBOY was
finished early while four wide into the turn.

Footnotes
SHACKS WAY away in good order, cleared toward the inside, dueled the middle half, shook off that foe, clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up
safe late. HARD TO FATHOM forwardly placed along the inside, in some traffic when creeping closer late in the second turn, got through along the rail,
moved out a bit and was slowly getting to the winner late. NIKOLAOU void of speed along the inside, two path into the lane, steered out, finished with good
late energy, too late. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK well back while outside, four wide through the final turn, also staged a belated rally while well out in the strip.
MARTINI BLU off step slow, moved up and raced in the second flight while racing off the inside, had little for the drive. OUT RUN'M also off a step slow, four
to five wide in the first turn when well off the pace, continued outside, three to four wide in the second bend, went evenly through the stretch. CURLY JACK
fell back to trail after the start, continued to lag into the far turn, came four wide for the drive, passed tiring rivals. HOME RUN TRICK pressed the winner
from the two path for just over six furlongs and began to give way. T BONES TRICK failed to make an impact in remaining back. MEGATAP in the main
group early off the inside, steadily faded. HERN had nothing for the drive. LIFE IS HARD steadied into the first turn, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
CHIRINGO within striking distance outside, ranged up to challenge four turning for home, drew clear under steady handling. LATE NITE RADIO lacked early
foot in the main body while three wide, continued in the three path out of the turn, finished up willingly to dead heat for the runner up spot. CLASSIFY in the
the second flight while in the two path, advanced and challenged between foes turning for home, proved no match for the winner, held gamely to garner part
of the place. GUNFLASH fell back to trail, raced in the two path through the turn, steered out a bit when rallying past the furlong marker, was going well late
through traffic. A LA CARTE back off the pace toward the inside, angled out sharply to be four wide exiting the turn, bettered position with some mild late
interest. BRESLAU broke well, in the second group while in the three path, challenged three wide and between horses entering the stretch, faltered past the
furlong marker. CATHEDRAL BEACH broke in, went one paced throughout along the inside. BOAT SONG off a step slow, lacked response off the inside.
RITHM NIC sprinted clear through a quick opening quarter, continued to lead into the turn, gave way when headed entering the start. JUILLIARD remained
back and was not a factor. MANTA REY was finished early while four wide.

PARIS STYLE (FR) unhurried for five furlongs, began to advance three wide midway on the final turn, set down in upper stretch, challenged on the outside
past the furlong marker, drove well clear. FLASHY LASS five wide into the first turn when with the lead pack, fell back in the run up the backstretch, four
wide into the far turn, advanced and challenged three wide with a quarter remaining, put that foe away in upper stretch, briefly responded when the winner
challenged soon after then could not match strides, clearly second best. C. C. HARBOR off a step slow, lagged well back toward the inside, swung five wide
into the lane, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be clear of the others. WEST SIDE GIRL void of speed three wide through the first turn,
continued back, closer when four to five wide turning for home, flattened out the final furlong. ROSE PARADE rank, forwardly placed while four wide early in
the first turn, took over from the outside before a half, worked way to the inside, weakened when headed by the runner up entering the stretch.
MAKEMEBELIEVE angled sharply to the inside first turn, forwardly placed, closer rail, in tight, took up into the far turn, fell quickly back, then passed tiring
rivals late. SISTER ELLA clear early in the two path, showed the way onto the backstretch, continued to vie, came in tight tighten up MAKEMEBELIEVE into
the far turn causing that one to take up, weakened. SEVEN NATTY PATTY pressed the pace off the inside, had little left for the drive. ENCHANTED NILE
finished after six furlongs while racing four wide. FOLLOWIONG A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN INTO THE FAR TURN, NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

SKELLY broke back, moved up to vie three wide, shook clear in the turn, maintained daylight through the lane while being kept to task. MISH off the early
pace and the inside, made a three wide move to be closest to the winner into the stretch, chased that one past the furlong marker, could do nothing more
with that rival late, clearly second best. PAYNE lacked speed, dropped to the inside to save ground through the turn, improved upper stretch, no match for
the top two, clear of the others. MAHOMEY off a step slow, four wide out of the turn, went evenly through the lane to finish up evenly. PERFECT DUDE four
wide when evenly paced through the turn, also lacked a closing rally. RUGGS flashed brief speed along the inside, faltered in the turn. EDGE TO EDGE
vied up front while inside the winner and between foes, backed up as well.

Footnotes
LOCHMOOR in mid pack just off the inside early, moved closer into the far turn, tipped out 3w to challenge turning for home, put a head in front soon after
and kicked clear under steady handling. ONE TEN STADIUM settled off the pace and the inside, began to advance far turn, floated out five wide into the
lane, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clear for the place. MAN IN THE CAN away in good order, cleared to the inside into the first turn, rated in
showing the way up the backstretch, could not match the top two in the drive, saved the show. CYBERTOWN prompted the pace from just off the inside,
challenged the leader two to three wide late in the final turn, between horses into the lane, flattened out. NAVY SEAL settled in mid pack, early inside, in the
two path in the final turn, staged a mild rally to improve position into the lane then also flattened out a bit. DINNER AT CRUMPIES four wide into the first
turn, continued in the main body while off the inside, four wide again into the far turn, went evenly through the lane. READY SHOES fell back to trail after the
start, continued back, angled four to five wide turning for home, improved position without posing a serious threat. WILLOW CREEK ROAD a bit rank early
when forwardly placed off the inside, continued forward up the backstretch, gave way entering the stretch. BLACK APPLE lacked speed while in the four
path first turn, four wide again in the second bend, came three wide for the drive, lacked a rally. CHEZ WHIZ off a step slow, five wide into the first turn, four
wide into the second bend, remained back in also lacking a closing kick. AFLEET SKY was finished early. AL'S ROMEO broke alertly, within striking
distance early, staged a steady retreat after a half.
