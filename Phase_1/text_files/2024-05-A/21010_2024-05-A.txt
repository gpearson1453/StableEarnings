REDHOTJUSTICE raced inside, rallied at the three-eighths pole, vied inside through the stretch, came out late and prevailed under mild urging. CHARMING
JAZEL was fractious in the gate, pressed early in the three path, settled, bid in the four path in early stretch and steadied late when REDHOTJUSTICE
came out. ABRA ABRA pressed the early pace and yielded late. SOLRUN raced well back and gained the fourth spot late. TWISTED GARTER led inside
and gave way on the far turn. BEYOND JUSTICE raced evenly. GARDEN SECRETS was fractious loading, was squeezed back at the start, stalked the
pace in the four path and gave way. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CHARMING JAZEL AGAINST THE
UNOFFICIAL WINNER, REDHOTJUSTICE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.
