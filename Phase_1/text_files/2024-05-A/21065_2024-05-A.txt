Footnotes
KAVALA was unhurried on the outside having one foe beaten down the back straight, made little headway throughout the turn, began to reach for more
ground under right handed urging turning for home, found another gear late bursting between horses with seventy yards from the wire and got up in the final
jump to win the photo in a well timed rally. MOONBRIGHT hounded the top two three deep outside at the beginning, tracked in the second flight outside on
the turn, moved to the leaders circling three wide at the quarter pole, fought outside for the front at the top of the stretch, edged away from the frontrunner in
deep stretch but was just nailed at the wire by the surging winner. HELLUVA HOLIDAY had a slim lead on the rail along the backside, continued setting the
pace while hounded outside going around the oval, was collared outside by another rival at the top of the lane, battled determinedly until on the fence until
deep stretch and faded to be a clear third at the wire. GOLDEN TRAIN broke in trading bumps with the inside rival at the start, regrouped to force the issue
up front between horses down the backstretch, dueled outside up top throughout the turn, could not go on with others making a move at th top of the lane
and faded in upper stretch holding for the minors. CHROME'S ANGEL settled all alone in mid-pack in the early going, tracked smartly just behind the
leaders waiting to move around the turn, shifted out for clear running room at the quarter pole four wide, could not rally and ran one paced to the finish line.
DOODLE DANDY broke outwards exchanging bumps with outside foe on the break to trail down the backside, could not get involved around the bend and
showed little in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ROBITAILLE stalked close to the back after the start, angled inside to the rail by the half, started to rally, picking up runners inside at the three eighths
marker, split foes in the three path to pose the main threat at the top of the stretch and shifted inwards to the rail in the last eighth to surge late winning on
the last jump. BASKETBALL JONES moved to challenge up front between foes by the half, bobbed heads outside for the lead on the turn, edged away from
the early pace foes at the quarter pole, was clinging onto the lead in upper stretch but was nailed at the wire by the winner in a tight photo. BANDERO was
in good position tracking the engaged trio at the start, waited to move going around the oval keeping a close eye on the leaders, loomed three wide when
roused entering the stretch and evened out in the final furlong to be a clear third. COLLABORATIVE brushed the outside foe on the break, stalked near the
back inside in the early going, saved ground through the turn, swung out widest in the five path turning for home and ran on mildly to settle on the fringes in
the end. SECRET STORM hopped at the start seeing the field down the backside, offered a mild run splitting foes at the three eighths marker, could not
sustain the run down the lane and finished up mildly through to the wire. MOMENT OF ZEN took command clearing to the rail leaving the chute, dueled
inside for the front through the turn, gave way up top on the fence by the quarter pole and wilted on the rail in upper stretch. COMPUTER HACKER was
brushed inside to begin, tracked three deep outside down the backstretch, could not go on with rivals at the half losing positions and retreated around the
bend.

Footnotes
CORNWALL was allowed to settle outside runners having on beaten down the backside, commenced his run extending his stride circling three wide by
mid-turn, closed in to the lead at the top of the lane and drew away in the late going for the score. ALWAYS A WAY was in between horses tracking the
leader, was roused for more run by the quarter pole, rallied up the rail in the stretch drive, was no match for the winner late but bested the rest with a solid
effort in the end. RED ENSIGN was in the second flight inside other rivals watching the lone pacesetter early on, came under a ride chasing the frontrunner
through the turn, battled with horses on either side while in the thick of things at the top of the lane and finished up willingly to be a non threatening third at
the wire. MEKO MAKEE was loose up front down the backstretch, dictated the pace left alone up top travelled around the bend, could not find more late and
was engulfed by runners in deep stretch. NEEDS FULFILLED was void of early speed spotting the field down the backside, continued to see the pack
around the turn and passed a weary runner in the stretch drive. HYPER AWAKENING was in the tracking flight four deep on the outside down the back
straight, was urged three wide at the three furlong pole, could not quicken with others on the turn and backed away with a quarter left to run.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA was in an ideal spot nestled on the rail sitting behind a quartet of rivals vying for the top spot throughout the turn, shifted out finding clear room
in the four path at the top of the lane and the veteran cruised on by for the score in the last sixteenth. SILENT MIRACLE took command from the onset, was
hounded outside down the backside and throughout the turn, gamely put away all the chasing rivals in upper stretch but could not hold off the winner who
had a perfect trip. C C'S KINGDOM stalked near the rear, closed in three wide not too far off the leaders trying to maintain forward position between runners
throughout the turn, was still in the mix five wide turning for home and finished up with good intent to be a solid third at the finish line. SPEEDY HANS
prompted to pace outside down the back straight, continued to hound the pacesetter in the two path with other challengers threatening on the outside
around the turn and could not fire down the lane settling for a minor role in the end. SPRING MOUNTAIN was under a hard hold with rivals on either side
tracking down the backside, lost position being shuffled back to last through the turn, shifted inside some to the rail in mid-stretch but could not be a factor to
the wire. CASANOVA KITTEN trailed the field in the early going, sensing the slow pace made an early move circling four wide while in hand around horses
with three furlongs to go, loomed in the six path widest of all runners at the top of the lane but tired in the last furlong.

Footnotes
CHROMEPLATED HEART was in mix inside early on, then was reined back to smartly track the contesting pair through the turn waiting for a seam under a
tight hold, found a clear lane in the three path making a bold move splitting rivals at the furlong pole and got up for the win in a photo at the wire. TEMPORA
stalked on the outside down the back straight, circled around horses three wide making a good move in mid-turn, loomed five wide entering the stretch, had
ahead in front with a sixteenth to go but lost the nod to the winner at the line. SWIRLING DANCER dueled outside in the early stages, forced the pace on
the turn, threaten up front four wide at the top of the lane, did not switch leads to the wire and held on to save third money. BIG GINGER emerged with a
slim advantage from the pack between runners at the half, set the pace while shadowed outside throughout the turn, continued to battle clinging onto the
lead straightening out for home but faded inside by mid-stretch for a minor role. LADY EVA was outrun early on to stalk on the fence, saved ground closing
the gap going around the bend and was one paced on the rail down the stretch. KANTBACKOFF trailed the field early on, offered a brief run three wide with
five sixteenths to go, swung out five wide at the top of the lane with a chance for a small piece of the prize but lacked a bid in the stretch run. PERFECT
PROVISION was under a snug hold tracking just behind the leaders down the backside, was roused three eighths from home, could not keep up with rivals
through the turn and was empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
COZY CURLIN KITTEN settled at the back near the inside, began to pick it up leaving the turn while being guided out, fanned seven wide into upper stretch,
took aim and stormed past and clear. ZEENA SWIFT was well-positioned stalking under a tight hold early, took closer order three wide outside the leader on
the turn, took over a narrow advantage at the top of the stretch, was no match for the winner but preserved the place. ARCTIC BLONDE stalked from
between runners mid-pack, went three then four wide on the turn, kept on evenly in the stretch. MAJESTIC APPEAL broke slowly and inwardly then was
urged forward inside rivals to make contact with the front-runners, came out off the fence past the three-sixteenths to pass a tiring rival along the fence,
drifted in once past that one in the furlong grounds, ran on. NIKITA'S GEM shifted in, tracked from inside mid-pack into and on the turn, came out four wide
in upper stretch seeking room, ran on. VILLI OLENTO settled between foes off the pace heading into the turn, shifted five to six wide leaving that bend,
needed more in the stretch. DESTIN NIGHT set the pace in the clear early racing on or just off the rail, was challenged through the turn by an outside rival,
came out a bit leaving that bend then moved back nearer the rail in upper stretch while starting to weaken, steadied when in tight at the eighth pole and
continued to fade thereafter. LANEY GRACE tossed the head at the start apparently brushing the gate lightly as well, raced outside at the rear, swung
seven wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. ROHESE stalked from outside, was done about the five-sixteenths, retreated and faded. FOLLOWING AN
INQUIRY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF DESTIN NIGHT AGAINST MAJESTIC APPEAL ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN
AND RESULTS TO STAND AS IS.

METAPHYSICAL watched the frontrunner sitting just behind under a snug hold down the backstretch through the turn, shifted out to the three path moving
smartly to the lead to seize command by the eighth pole and was kept to the task to hold safe at the wire. READY FOR SHIRL stalked near the rear with
horses on each side, bided her time looking for running room through the turn, followed the eventual winner three wide straightening out for home and was
gaining late but not enough. KIN'S CONCERTO was situated on the rail in mid-division down the backside, lost some positioning on the fence having to wait
while others were commencing a run outside on the turn, loomed on the rail starting to rally at the top of the lane but could not match strides with the top two
in deep stretch. LUNCH WITH BERNIE was unhurried trailing in the beginning, began to pick up runners three wide between foes with a quarter left to go,
shifted in then out weaving through horses down the stretch and closed in for a minor share in the end. FIRING BULLETS travelled outside runners in
midfield, moved in three wide outside horses three wide by mid-turn, angled out six wide for the drive to be in with a chance but stalled with a sixteenth left
to go. PRINCESS MAYFAIR took control from the onset comfortably getting to the rail along the backside, put away the pesky chasing rival on the turn,
braced for the challengers at the top of the stretch, but had nothing left in reserve to hold off the rivals and faded. WILDFIRE was eager under a hard hold
just outside the leader down the backside, chased the frontrunner on the turn, angled out to be in lane four straightening for home but retreated in the final
furlong. CINNAMON BITS stalked outside down the backstretch, could not get into contention travelling outside runners throughout the turn, swung out
widest in the six path turning for home but could not make any impact outside.

Footnotes
RONDURE was quite content to track the loose pacesetter along the backside, started to reel in the frontrunner by mid-turn, loomed between horses in the
four path at the top of the lane, gained command by the sixteenth pole and tenaciously prevailed in a tight finish. BORDER TOWN stalked the pace outside
in the spread out field down the backside, improved position into the turn, posed a threat outside widest in the six path for the drive to the line, rallied
strongly but was denied by the winner in a photo. SECRET RESERVE loped along unopposed leaving the chute, opened up extending the advantage
setting a soft pace by the half, maintained a slim lead in upper stretch, was collared by the winner at the furlong marker and tried to dug back in late on the
fence. SOUTH BEND stalked on the inside in the early going, saved ground on the fence around the bend, angled out five wide for the drive and
determinedly closed in late but ran out of room at the finish line. LUCKMAN galloped along seeing the field down the backstretch in the spread out pack,
made little impression around the oval and finished up closing the gap through the stretch but was never involved.

Footnotes
QUIET MADDELENA was pinched at the break, recovered quickly clearing to the lead getting the rail by the three furlong marker, continued setting the pace
on the turn and opened up when set down at the eighth pole for a dominant win. MISS BOBBIT was brushed inside at the start, improved outside along the
backstretch to track the pacesetting winner at the half and chased the winner, but to no avail on the turn and through the stretch. MI TORMENTA travelled
on the fence in midfield, was then taken a hold off when stuck behind a fading rival on the rail with two furlongs to run and finished up smartly between
horses to be a solid third crossing the finish line. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER trailed the field after the start, began to go by runners outs at the half mile marker,
found a seam in the five path turning for home, battlled for third money to the wire but had to settle on the fringes in the end. MORE SAVVY stalked on the
outside near the back of the pack, made no progress running around the turn and showed late interest passing some running to the finish line. ENGLISH
BISCUIT broke out on the start, settled in mid-pack between rivals, put in a brief run when urged between runners in the two path mid-turn, dueled for the
show award in upper stretch but faded at the furlong pole. NATASHA'S BIZNIZ chased the frontrunning winner just outside a foe on the turn, began to
weaken losing position with five sixteenth remaining and folded while six wide with an eighth left to go. SWEET FINALE chased the winner inside, tried to
keep pace on the fence while roused around the oval and yielded on the rail at the furlong marker. CALL ME BROOKE was situated in the third flight outside
four deep through the backside, offered a mild run three wide outside at the three furlong marker and could not go on in the stretch, giving way in the five
path at the top of the lane. DEVIL IN HER HEART was near the rear stalking the pace inside, had little show running throughout the turn and could not play
a role in the stretch running.
