Footnotes
PURRFECT MOON was nicely rated along the rail between the two fields of rivals, fanned out four wide leaving the bend and steadily gained ground,
passing the sparring duet in the late stretch and was up in time. TENSAS LU LU dueled with an inner rival into the turn, continued to spar grudgingly in the
deep stretch then was out finished by an outer rival and was best for the place position. CINCO GAL sparred with an outer rival into the turn and into the
early stretch, was in a long drive, then was out finished in the final yards. BEAUXS ARTES tracked the dueling leaders from the inside into the turn, was in
hard drive at the top of the stretch, could not catch the pace setters and missed the show prize in the end. JUST ADORABLE was allowed to settle while two
wide and between rivals, then rallied mildly in the late stretch and came up empty. CAPETOWN CANDY saved ground in the early furlongs came out four
wide leaving the bend and did not spark in the lane. SPOOKY SPICE was flat throughout and needed rally in the end.

Footnotes
MAGIC CASTLE led the way from the inside, maintained a steady drive leaving the bend and held on well down the lane while in a determined rally to prove
best in the end. FIRE SWORD moved up to s circled six wide leaving the bend, angled inwardly and continued to gain ground eagerly and just missed
victory in the end. MISTER K pressed the pace from the two path, was in a hard drive throughout the turn, then gave way in the late stretch and held onto
the show position. IN THE ARCH broke outwardly and bumped foe, was allowed to settle along the inside, came out five to six wide in the upper stretch and
was improving in the late stretch. TAKE ME UP BRADY stalked the pace while two wide into the turn, then rallied at the top of the stretch before giving way
in the end. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET hustled from the rear to the front to bid from the three path on the turn, attempted to steal the lead from the pace setter
at the quarter pole while in a gamely drive, was unsuccessful and lost momentum in the stretch. PLAY RULE was bumped at the start, then tucked along the
inside and raced at a moderate pace throughout and lacked rallying in the stretch.

Footnotes
SONNY BOB saved ground in the early furlongs mid field, then urged steadily while two wide on the far turn, dug in gamely in the early stretch and swept by
the dueling rivals to be up at the wire. CHASING COYOTES was squeezed at the start, then tracked the leading trio from the two path in the early stages,
was moving up swiftly on the far turn to duel with the remaining pace setter in the early stretch, then was surpassed by a rival on the outside in the final
yards and was best for second. MANIFESTED broke inwardly and bumped rival, vied from the inside in the early furlongs, was in a long drive to gain the
lead momentarily heading into the far turn, was confronted by an outer rival to duke out in the early stretch then was out finished in the end. YO SOY ROY
conserved energy in the early furlongs, was in a hard drive on the far turn to rally mildly in the late stretch but it was not enough in the end. HE'S
CHARMING broke outwardly, then vied between rivals down the early backstretch, continued to press the inner rival throughout the far turn while in a
determined bid, could not retain stride and flattened out in deep stretch. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN broke outwardly and bumped rival, then tracked the pace
from the inside at an even pace throughout and failed to rally in the stretch. MORO TRENDSETTER raced in the middle pack while two wide down the
backstretch, then bid gamely while four wide on the far turn and came up flat in the stretch. TITO was shuffled back at the start, then steadied heading into
the first turn and failed to menace. DADA BOOM RIDGE was unhurried early along the inside and passed a tired foe in the lane. DOC HENRY RIDGE
moved from the three path into the turn, to vie with inner rivals down the backstretch, was thru after the three eighths and faded in the remaining furlongs.

NEVER SWAY steadily gained ground while four wide, confronted the dueling pace setters at the quarter pole to battle it out at the top of the stretch, then
tipped away and held on well while in a strong drive to prevail. LET HER BUCK dueled with an inner rival into the turn, gained command momentarily at the
five sixteenths marker, then was met with another rival on the outside to battle in the early stretch then yielded in the final yards. NIGHT ORB dueled from
the inside into the turn, was in a hard drive while battling with outer rivals at the top of the stretch then gave way in the end. RUMPUS urged steadily from
the two path while at the back and was no menace. FIESTA BESTA bid for the lead early while four wide, then settled back along the inside on the turn and
was no threat. TAY TAY'S BABY settled along the inside and was no factor.
