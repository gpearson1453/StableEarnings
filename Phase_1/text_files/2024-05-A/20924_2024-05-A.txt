Footnotes
SPALIDAY was settled back early, raced in the two path on the far turn, was in traffic leaving the three sixteenths and angled out for racing room nearing the
furlong marker, then made a bid on the outside and drew clear under a vigorous handling with a couple right handed taps with the crop. POSITIVE CARRY
(IRE) was reserved early, advanced two wide on the far turn, moved out and made a five wide bid leaving the turn to hit the front nearing the furlong marker,
then shook clear but was caught leaving the sixteenth marker and could not match strides with the winner late while being clearly second best. JUST THE
SKY was allowed to settle early while three wide, remained three wide on the far turn and made a four wide move off the turn to vie for command but
flattened out in the final furlong while staying on for the show award. PAST TENSE was settled back early, saved ground on the far turn, came three wide
into the lane and moved out in the stretch and offered a belated rally to gain the last spot in the superfecta. GASPARILLA was allowed to settle early, was
two wide on the turn and made a two wide bid off the turn to vie for command but faded in the final furlong. THE TACO LADY was away alertly and set the
early pace, then dropped to the inside on the first turn and opened up on the backstretch, then was headed leaving the three sixteenths and weakened in

Footnotes
AUTUMN EVENING broke out at the start forcing EXPERIMENTAL to take brief hold, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced to take narrow command swinging seven wide into upper stretch, drew clear
under a drive kept to task. CAMERA five wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked three wide into the turn advancing to press the pace of PLAY GOOD PAY
GOOD, took over narrow command just inside the five-sixteenths, got headed spinning five wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping
on clear for the place honors. PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand three then two wide, came
under pressure through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, got headed for the front near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and weakened. EXPERIMENTAL a bit reluctant to load prior to the start, got steadied at the break when AUTUMN EVENING broke outwards
taking over her lane, chased four then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. PATRICIA ANN away
with the field, came under a light rating hold along the inside, hopped a few strides before jumping tracks at the crossover from the barn area to the paddock
just prior to the seven-eighths pole and lost the rider as a result, then got apprehended by outrider and was walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
GENTLEMAN JOE stalked the early pace three wide, then was two to three wide on the turn, made a bid nearing the quarter pole to go on even terms for
command, then came three wide off the turn and gained a short lead, then was clear by the furlong marker and widened the margin in the final furlong to
prove best under crop urging. MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT was off a half a step slow, then moved up the inside to set a pressured pace by the three quarter
pole, then shook clear until being headed by the quarter pole, fought on to the wire but could not match strides with the winner while clearly second best.
LORD CAPTAIN prompted the early pace two wide and faded on the turn, then bested the others for the show award while no match to the top two.
MARKET ALERT was bumped at the start, then tracked the pace on the inside and made a middle move up the inside but could not sustain that bid and
faded. CENTAVO was rated along on the outside and made a four wide move nearing the quarter pole but flattened out. GRANDPA'S KID was reserved
early and saved ground on the turn, swung out wide leaving the turn but had no rally.

MIGHTY ATLAS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch,
rallied along the inside and was just up in the final jumps to prevail. LUCENCY coaxed from the start, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader,
advanced to take command near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat to the outside from
DEBATE and was caught inside in the final strides to the finish. DEBATE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on through to the finish to be along clear for the show honors.
MEMPHIS five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. TEPEU showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing when displaced
at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

best. HEIR PORT vied for the lead on the outside and came four wide off the bend but proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award.
PREDICTED chased the early pace three wide, then got out on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and finished willingly to just miss the place award.
BUSTIN SHOUT was settled early, saved ground on the turn, came three wide off the bend and moved out in the lane and had a belated rally to gain the
last spot in the superfecta. HOT ROD RUMBLE set a pressured pace on the inside, then vied for the lead on the inside on the turn but weakened in the

Footnotes
MASTER PIECE (CHI) tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, inherited the front when OTTOMAN FLEET drifted out a furlong out, then dug in gamely and stubbornly to hold a neck advantage to the finish.
OTTOMAN FLEET (GB) bobbled at the break getting away last and coming under brief coaxing, tracked just off the inside from near the rear of the compact
field, tipped two to three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, advanced quickly swinging three wide for home and seized
command with three-sixteenths to go, drifted out two paths under a left handed crop nearing the eighth pole conceding command to the aforementioned foe,
came in to look that rival in the eye through the final sixteenth fighting on to the finish but was repelled to the wire. PIONEERING SPIRIT established the
front and showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, remained patiently handled facing little pressure until midway on the far turn as
the field in behind got busy, remained on hold until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch under threat from a pair, got collared three-sixteenths from
home and kept on to preserve the show honors. LIMITED LIABILITY saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled
out four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. OLYMPIC DREAMS forwardly placed tracking the leader from the two path in closest aim, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, tipped three to four wide into upper stretch and tired.

DANCING BUCK vied for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the bend to shake clear, then responded well to remain clear to prove best.
AMERICAN MONARCH was rated along and was between rivals on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the bend and finished well to gain the place
award. ALOGON was between rivals early, then settled and shifted out and ranged up four wide off the turn to make a bid but hung in the final sixteenth.
YES AND YES tracked the pace along the inside and lacked the needed kick in the lane. THIN WHITE DUKE was reserved early, three wide on the turn,
came wide into the lane and had a belated rally on the outside. DURANTE pressed the early pace three wide and then vied for the lead three wide on the
turn but faded in the drive. NOTHING BETTER reared up moments before the gated open and was at least ten lengths last, then saved ground on the turn
and was not a threat. OUR SHOT shut off after the start, reserved on the inside, eased out on the turn and swung out seven wide leaving the bend and had
no rally. BRING ME A CHECK pressed the pace two wide and in between rivals then weakened.

SOUL OF AN ANGEL chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a
furlong out, drew clear under a drive to prevail. RANDOMIZED established the front just after the start and showed the way in hand just off the inside
through swift splits under some prompting from GREEN UP to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, remained on hold and spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, couldn't match that foe late while running on to
preserve the place honors. SHIDABHUTI five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit, tucked three wide through the far turn and came
under coaxing near the quarter pole, went seven wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. FINGAL'S CAVE four then three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened. AIN'T BROKE chased three then two wide, got caught in behind GREEN UP
backing up just inside the five-sixteenths and paused and was shuffled back behind that rival until able to escape inside to swing three wide into upper
stretch, then tired in the stretch and then was reported to have bled. GREEN UP prompted the pace three then two wide, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, got shaken off five-sixteenths from home and retreated quickly, swung five wide for home, got eased home through to the finish and was
subsequently vanned off and reported to have bled.

BOXED WINE was settled early on the inside, saved ground on the turn and angled out off the far turn and made a bid when clear and drew away to prove
much the best under mild urging. ADDAGIRL ADDIE was bumped at the start, reserved early, three wide on the far turn and came six wide into the lane,
rallied well to get up for the place award. LU'S REDEMPTION tracked and then stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened
out in the final sixteenth, lost place award late. ALETTE D'ORO was well rated along the inside, eased out and made a two wide bid leaving the bend but
flattened out late, lost bob for the show award. MISS LAO vied for the early lead, then went on to set the pace while clear on the inside but weakened in the
final furlong. LAURANA was bumped at the break, settled two wide early, dropped to the inside on the far turn but offered no rally. PAMPLONA RED was
settled back early on the inside, two wide on the far turn and swung out six wide leaving the turn, then lugged in through the lane and had no rally. LUNA
PATINA was reserved early, saved ground on the turn but had no rally. DUBAWI WOWIE was close up early, then rated off the pace and was in between
rivals then weakened. SAVING MEMORIES was bumped at the break, outrun early and saved ground on the turn but was not a threat. SHEHANAH vied for
the early lead, then stalked the pacesetter two wide and tired. SAVANNAH DANCER chased the pace four wide and tired.
