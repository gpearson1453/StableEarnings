Footnotes
HANDSOME RED tracked the speed from the two path to the far turn, tipped out a bit late on the bend, took aim three wide approaching the stretch,
challenged from outside, dueled through the lane and dug in to best the runner-up. GHOSTLY ACT hit the gate in the beginning, raced keenly while stalking
the pacesetter from outside into the first turn then settled around the bend, bid two wide midway around the second bend, inched ahead past the quarter
pole, put away inner rival and met the bid from HANDSOME RED, battled inside that rival through the final furlong and finished gamely in defeat. LUCKY N
SMART was off a bit slow to begin, sat off the pace outside a rival, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out further and chased within striking distance at
the furlong marker but finished evenly in deep stretch. RUN BRYCE RUN raced keenly along the rail into the first turn then settled in a nice spot behind the
pacesetter in hand, tipped two wide late on the far turn, had nowhere to go when boxed in upper stretch, gained a clear path but weakened in the late
stages. DEFENSOR FORTIS cleared quickly and crossed over to the inside, showed the way along the inside to the far turn, challenged from outside near
the five-sixteenths pole, lost command late on that bend and weakened down the lane. VOLS reserved early on the inside, hugged the rail to the stretch,
angled out in the lane and lacked a rally. MAXVILLE broke a step slow, trailed two wide then along the rail, saved ground through the far turn then came off
the rail a bit and made no impact.

Footnotes
STAY ON THE FENCE pressed the pace from inside, dueled around the turn, shook free in upper stretch, kept busy into the final sixteenth and was geared
down in the final strides. BELLA VIENNA broke alertly and set the tone early outside STAY ON THE FENCE, fought head to head through the turn and into
the lane, yielded in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. HAYWOOD chased the top pair from inside, shifted to the two path on the turn, steered
out in the lane and failed to threaten. IMMELMANN stumbled leaving the gate, chased from outside, rounded the bend in the three path and weakened.

INVINCIBLE MOLLY (GB) forced in leaving the gate, settled inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled off the fence, surged late and got up at the wire.
SOHO cleared and showed the way up the back stretch, set the pace along the rail to the stretch, remained clear into deep stretch and got nailed by the
winner. ELEGANT came in at the start, stalked the lone leader from inside, was closest in pursuit through the turn, chased within striking distance down the
lane but could not summon the needed late kick. SHE IS ROMANTIC broke alertly then tracked off the rail, rounded the bend two then three wide and could
not respond when called upon. PARADISE LAKE broke out, stalked the leader outside a rival, remained two wide to the stretch and weakened down the
lane.

WE'LL DO IT LIVE bobbled to the front, dueled for the lead from outside, shook free past the three-eighths pole, put to right handed urging in the lane and
remained unchallenged to the line. SATELLITE HEART tossed her head but only lost a step at the start, chased four deep into the turn, three deep into the
stretch, kept on willingly but was unable to reach the winner. PETIT FILET chased the top pair from inside, hugged the rail through the turn, followed within
range entering the furlong grounds but faltered in deep stretch. BEAU SOLEIL threw her head leaving the gate to lose a few lengths, moved up between
rivals, got shuffled back to last on the turn, angled out and came four wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. BIG RAINBOW stalked three deep early,
rounded the bend three then two wide between rivals and weakened in the drive. PANDA PEAK dueled from inside, lost touch with the winner past the
three-eighths pole and tired in the stretch run.

SPICYBUG broke a step slow then got bumped from outside, rushed up to duel from inside, carried a short lead over TOM'S REGRET into the stretch,
maintained the advantage into the final sixteenth and drew clear late. TOM'S REGRET broke in and bumped SPICYBUG then dueled outside that rival for
command, kept the pressure on to the sixteenth pole and yielded late while holding second. ROSE MADDOX trailed early, passed rivals two wide on the
turn, moved out in the lane and put in a mild late bid. ALTERNATE ROCK stalked off the rail then moved inside, saved ground through the turn while falling
back to last, moved out in the lane and lacked further response. RECINTO ROMPERE raced up close outside the top pair, chased two wide then along the
rail and weakened.

PRECISION STRIKE hustled to the front and showed the way from inside while under pressure, cleared NAVAJO WARRIOR past the three-eighths pole,
met the bid from BATTLE CRUISER with a quarter mile remaining, dueled down the lane and dug in the last sixteenth to draw clear. BATTLE CRUISER
forwardly placed three deep, bid from outside at the quarter pole, dueled to the sixteenth and got turned away. NAVAJO WARRIOR off alertly and fought
two wide into the first turn, pressed the leader from outside up the backstretch, could not keep up past the three-eighths pole, chased a bit off the rail into
the lane, weakened in the stretch run but managed to save third. MONGOLIAN MAX broke a step slow, chased in the two path at the back, had one rival
beat three wide into the stretch, moved back in some and could not rally. KOBE W stalked four deep around the clubhouse turn, came under a ride still wide
on the second bend and weakened down the lane. MONGOLIAN GOLD broke a step slow, stalked along the inside, roused to keep up at the midway point,
dropped back to last on the far turn and faded.

SEVENTEEN BLACK settled inside, gained along the rail on the far turn, steered to the outside in upper stretch, rallied four deep and got up in the closing
moments. FERRARIANO stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, tracked from inside then gained in the two path on the second bend, moved out and
launched a bid three deep with a furlong remaining, fought gamely to the wire but got edged by the winner. SIR PISTOLERO dueled briefly from outside
then ceded command and stalked the lone leader in the two path, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, cut into the lead around the far turn, challenged
between rivals with a furlong remaining, battled to the wire but got outkicked. WHAT A DUDE dueled from inside then cleared outer rival and showed the
way along the inside, opened up a comfortable lead on the backstretch, held a diminishing lead entering the stretch, met a pair of bids near the eighth pole,
battled through deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. DERECHO DANDY bumped leaving the gate, sat off the pace outside a rival, chased three then two
wide on the far turn and could not rally. HARD MISSION hit the gate and bobbled in the beginning, unhurried and moved into the two path, rounded the far
turn four then three wide and failed to menace. QUAGMIRE MAGIC stumbled and bumped on both sides leaving the gate, steered to the inside racing at the
back, trailed into the lane and never made an impact.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA TIGER threw his head leaving the gate, chased three deep into the turn, angled six wide into the stretch, rallied from outside, dueled with
GIVER NOT A TAKER in deep stretch and won the bob on the line. GIVER NOT A TAKER settled off the inside, went three wide into the turn, angled out
and came five wide into the stretch, rallied to confront the leaders, dueled with CALIFORNIA TIGER in the final sixteenth and got outnodded at the wire.
JAMMING EDDY settled out of range on the inside, asked left handed entering the lane, moved out and bid between rivals but got outkicked by the top pair.
DISOBEY took control early from outside with ANDY CAN U HEAR ME forcing the issue, raced on even terms around the bend, inched ahead again in
upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages. ANDY CAN U HEAR ME pressed from inside, head the leader around the bend, kept the pressure on to the
sixteenth pole and weakened late. BELLY UP stalked the top pair from outside up the backstretch, driven three wide into the lane and weakened. TOM
HORN stumbled badly leaving the gate, pulled the rider along in the early going, saved ground to the stretch and was not persevered with in the last
sixteenth. SEATTLE BREAKOUT hopped at the start, chased widest up the backstretch, rounded the bend five wide, then came six wide into the stretch
and was never a factor.

from inside, controlled the pace from the rail position, pressured leaving the clubhouse turn, cleared leaving the backstretch, tested by DUVET DAY (IRE) at
the quarter pole, lost command at the top of the stretch and gave way. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) traveled outside a rival near the back early, came three wide

past the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. MILAGRE DO SOL was closest in pursuit from the two path early, moved up to apply pressure from
