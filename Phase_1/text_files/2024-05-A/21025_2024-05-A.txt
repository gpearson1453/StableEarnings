FOURWAY STOP set the pace in the two path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, and drew clear. BELLA CARMELINA tracked in the two path, was
cued into the far turn, and kept on along the inside down the stretch for place. FAR ABOVE laid up close in the four path, bid between foes going into the far
turn, but finished evenly from the three path down the lane for show. TIZ ERIN stalked in the five path, bid outside of a duo midway around the far turn, but
flattened in the stretch. LUNETTA JAK broke out and bumped an outer foe, then steadied early, trailed along the inside and never threatened. MISS
MELODRAMATIC got bumped by an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path rounding the first turn, moved up in the six path passing the half, but
backed up around the far turn.

GOLDCREST dueled at the rail for a half, continued on the left lead in the lane and drew off under a steady drive. NUMERIC dueled outside of the winner,
was no match for that foe in the lane and lasted for the place. MORENA DANCER raced off the pace two and three wide and bested the rest. TONE ELISE
broke in a tangle and was immediately far behind, saved ground and passed tiring rivals. WIN OR CELLAR had only brief speed four wide. DEVRA

SUPER FREAKY GIRL set the pace in the three path, tipped into the two path and opened up going into the turn, was roused at the top of the lane, and
drew clear. FAR AND FEW pressed in the two path, had to check going into the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and chased on for
place. ERNESTINA broke out at the start, chased in the four path and finished evenly from the six path down the lane for show. PRINCESS MISS EMIL
dropped wellback in the three path and made no impact from the five path in the stretch. QUEEN TATIANA had an awkward start, rated in the three path,
fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, and never threatened. BIANKA HEART tracked in the two path but weakened from the three path in the
stretch. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF FAR AND FEW AGAINST THE RIDER OF SUPER FREAKY GIRL FOR INTERFERENCE GOING

MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA saved ground in range, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, split rivals in upper stretch, took over near the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. LOVE RHAPSODY set a rated pace inside, led to the sixteenth pole and held well for the place. KILKENNY BELLA raced off the pace
three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, angled to the rail near the quarter pole, made progress inside in upper stretch, tipped out
leaving the eighth pole and gained the show. RECONNECTING pressed the pace two wide, bid nearing the quarter pole, drifted out turning for home and
weakened. DARLING DARLEY chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. GRATIA was hard held early and trailed inside.

TAKECAREOFBUSINESS trailed in the three path, was driven in the five path around the turn, swung out to the six path at the top of the lane, rallied, and
inched ahead of an inner foe in the final sixteenth. RHUM SAINT ESPRIT prompted the pace in the four path, bid around the turn, stuck his nose in front
passing the quarter, dug in from the five path into the stretch, but was caught by an outer foe around the sixteenth to place. ADIOS COLE tracked along the
rail, was ridden around the turn, and kept on up the inside for show. HEALS THE SOUL chased in the two path but was one paced from the three path in the
stretch. PAYNTED BLUE set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the three eighths, but faded between foes down the lane.

Footnotes
FOXTROT HARRY stalked in the four path, came under right handed urging in the three path midway around the far turn, tipped out to the five path at the
top of the lane, kicked on, and drew past an inner foe late. DUNES OF GOLD showed the way in the three path, opened up from the two path around the far
turn, was roused while back in the three path at the top of the stretch, and kept on, but was caught by an outer foe late to place. ANNOINTED rated in the
four path, was coaxed into the far turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the lane, and evened out for show. RAMESSES got bumped by an inner foe
at the start, raced off the pace in the five path but was no factor. R B'S RUNNER got bumped by an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was
driven from the rail into the far turn, but did not threaten. HE'S A WILD CHILD bumped foes on both sides at the start, then trailed throughout.
