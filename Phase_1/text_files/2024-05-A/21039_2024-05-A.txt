quarter ple, outside stretch run, mild improvement. BLEST LIFE broke a bit tardy and never menaced throughout. MS TEMPTATION through early from
inside, dropped back readily.

clear but, weakened readily in the late going. NOT LISTENING bore in start, chased pace, gave in readily in the stretch run. ROUNDER was slammed at the
start, well back to far turn, moved up late going. ROYALLY BITTER awkward start, rushed to chase, bid at the quarter pole, hung. MOON MISCHIEF speed
to the front, led to far turn from inside, gave way readily. BELL CURVE was through early with a steady decline throughout. THE RIDER OF ROUNDER
