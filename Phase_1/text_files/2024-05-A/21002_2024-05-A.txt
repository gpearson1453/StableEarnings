CATCHING HEAT three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing when taking narrow command between foes at the five-sixteenths,
swung three wide into upper stretch, got bumped by SHIRL'S DELIGHT straightened away, inched clear near the eighth pole, dug in and held on to prevail.
SAVE TIME broke in a step at the start bumping SHIRL'S DELIGHT, then bumped that rival once more, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in and miss at the end by a bob of the head. SHIRL'S DELIGHT
got bumped at the start by SAVE TIME, who broke inwards and then was bumped again by that rival, chased five paths off the inside just off the pace down
the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole heads apart for command, swung four wide into upper
stretch, came in bumping CATCHING HEAT straightened away, then kept on through to the finish to secure the show honors. JUST MUSIC coaxed from

Footnotes
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER was taken in hand when the pacesetter crossed in front early then switched out under some urging, tracked the pace on the
outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under
steady urging. CEES GET DEGREES angled in quickly while going to the front, jostled with a rival and put that foe in tight quarters near the five-eighths
pole, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while challenged on the turn, was headed near the quarter-pole, lost touch with the winner
into the final furlong and proved no match but held the place. SPUN AND WON dropped back while hustled from the gate then switched out under urging,
traveled around the turn in the two path and missed the place while clear for the show. MANDATORY was restless in the gate then off slow, spotted the
front a few lengths, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path, came out some into upper stretch and failed to respond. KUPP was
hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside of a foe, lost action while put in tight by that foe near the five-eighths pole then checked and dropped
back, saved ground on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths pole and came up empty.

four path on the turn, rallied seven wide at the quarter-pole, was carried out while gaining in upper stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the
sixteenth-pole, fought with the runner-up to the finish and got up to narrowly prevail under strong urging. REFUAH settled under some urging, moved closer
while angling from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide at the quarter-pole, was carried out some while chasing in upper stretch, gained to take the
advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, led to the final strides but was denied while clear for the place. ENDOWED was hustled from the gate while off a bit
slow, established a good position towards the front, was asked leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, steadied outside the quarter-pole,
swung five wide into the stretch, chased the vanguard into the final furlong, brushed with an opponent outside the sixteenth-pole and just got up for the
show. MAJESTIC ARC broke out then was corrected the the rider, showed speed and led early, lost the advantage inside the three-quarter pole then
stalked on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, regained the lead outside the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out under pressure in upper stretch,
continued to drift out some while overtaken inside the furlong marker and tired then lost the show. FIGHTING BACK broke awkwardly and a bit slow then
dropped back, settled under some urging, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole, entered the final furlong under a drive, raced
between foes into the final sixteenth and failed to threaten. BOBBY THE TANK showed speed then took the lead inside the three-quarter pole, vied along
the rail while asked on the turn, lost the advantage inside the three-eighths pole, dropped back into the stretch and capitulated. FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE

Footnotes
PENTAGON coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung six
wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong collaring the runner up inside the final seventy yards and dug in to prevail. ELLE
EST FORTE got brushed at the break by GRACEFUL ROSE, who broke out a step, chased just off the inside from mid pack, remained patiently handled
until let out spinning five wide into upper stretch, rallied to collar the leader just inside the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught inside the
final seventy yards while clear of the rest and second best. DIAMOND STATUS got bumped at the start by KANNON FIRE due to pressure from CRIMSON
PRINCESS, established the front after the break and showed the way crossing three then two wide into the first turn, settled in hand along the inside down
the backstretch and into the far turn and patiently awaited a challenge, got one and was roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive and was caught inside the eighth pole, kept on to preserve the show honors. SILENT MELODY tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, raced in behind the leader until tipped out a sixteenth from home one path and
weakened in the late stages. KANNON FIRE got bumped at the start by CRIMSON PRINCESS and in turn bumped DIAMOND STATUS, chased along the
inside patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late going. ANILEATE away to an awkward start, settled
just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CRIMSON
PRINCESS broke out at the start bumping KANNON FIRE into DIAMOND STATUS, tracked two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home and weakened. MISS BONNIE T following a shoe repair in the paddock, raced three wide through the first turn before tracking
from the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. GRACEFUL ROSE broke out a
step at the start brushing ELLE EST FORTE, tracked the pace along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. MISS KRISTY just off the inside at the tail of the field, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide at the top
of the stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KUCHAR coaxed from the gate, raced four wide through the first turn and then four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied in tandem with OUSTER to overthrow the
leader a sixteenth out and knocked heads to the finish and ultimately got the nod on the wire. OUSTER lunged at the break getting away last, raced along
the rail and was forced to check when TABEGUACHE placed BARESE directly in front in tight into the first turn, chased five then four paths off the inside
down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied digging in to issue a
challenge inside the final furlong showing good courage and just lost the bob on the line. TABEGUACHE established the front at the start and crossed to the
two path and briefly inside forcing both BARESE and OUSTER in behind him to check into the first turn, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked
inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and dug in under a drive under threat from a
pair, got collared a sixteenth out, fought on to the finish. SIGNATOR two to three wide through the first turn, chased five wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and kept on one paced through to the end. CURBSTONE three wide through the first turn, chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. UNBRIDLED BOMBER three to four
wide into the first turn, tucked to the two path midway, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven to eight wide
for home and offered no response. CURLIN'S WISDOM coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. BARESE got forced to check into the first turn and struck the rail forcing OUSTER to
check in behind when TABEGUACHE tucked briefly in front, chased two to three wide, came under brief coaxing at the five-sixteenths and cornered two to
three wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
LIAR'S POKER was eased back before the first turn then tucked in, went around that bend in the two path, was reserved off the pace with cover, moved
from the two path to the three path while let out on the final turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid inside the furlong
marker and got up in the final sixteenth under steady handling to prevail. MAURITIUS moved in while going to the front, rounded the first turn in the two
path, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, shook off a foe near the
furlong marker but was soon challenged by the runner-up, led to the sixteenth-pole then was headed, fought to the finish and just missed while clear for the
place. BARNSTORMING bumped with a rival just after the start while hustled, rounded the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, was
given his cue in the two then three path on the final turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled with the runner-up while remaining on his inside lead in
upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead while dropping back near the sixteenth-pole and tired while able to get the show. GOOD MEDICINE bumped with
a foe just after the start then dropped back while taken up some in tight between horses, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, saved
ground while roused on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. NOBLE HUNTSMAN was taken in hand
then dropped back while shut-off by a foe after the break, went around both turns in the two path and was no factor. COLLECT FROM IKE came outward at
the start, moved out in the early going, went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. OCTOBER BLISS went two to three wide while settling off the pace, was roused on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. ATLANTA'S ACUNA was taken in hand early, saved ground while tugging keenly on the bit going around the first turn, was rated in a
good position just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the far turn and came up empty. DUNE ROAD was fractious in the gate, bumped with a foe
just after the start then was taken up in tight quarters, went three wide on the first turn, settled at the back on the outside, traveled three wide on the far turn
and failed to respond. HALF-MILE FRACTION WAS OMITTED DUE TO SOMETHING TRIPPING THE SENSOR EARLY
