BATTALIA quickly took control, widened on the turn and lasted while tiring but remaining safe in the final furlong. CHANCE OCCURRENCE bumped into the
far turn, recovered, split rivals in the stretch and closed well. S K MOON came out near the seven sixteenths bumping rival, moved wide and went evenly
late. METANOIA bumped near the far turn, chased wide throughout and finished willingly. PETITE POMME FRITE pursued the winner outside and came up
empty in the final eighth. LADY GABRIELLE was soundly bumped off stride near the far turn and faded. ORB'S PARTY GIRL saved ground, came out
causing bumping incidents near the far turn. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident near the far turn.

PINK ROSE settled off the pacesetter, advanced on the turn, rallied outside that rival turning for home, quickly took charge, drew clear under urging and
held well for the win. BAILINTIN raced off the pace, advanced on the turn, came two wide into the lane, rallied inside and closed well for second.
DESIGNATED raced three or four wide off the pace, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. LOVE TO EAT showed
good early speed racing with a clear lead, opened up a wider margin, had no response when challeged and gave way in the stretch. MY LITTLE RED raced
off the pace inside and failed to threaten. BREEZY DANCE raced three wide off the pace and gave way.

RUNANDSCORE set a pressured pace inside, repelled a strong challenge in midstretch and gamely pulled clear in the final furlong. FERRARI KID settled
close up inside, angled out in the stretch, loomed a threat then yielded. CHECK MY SIX raced close up between rivals, moved wide into the lane and
flattened out. GAME SEVEN prompted the pace three wide to the stretch and faltered. NONEEDTOWORRY trailed far behind then caught fading rivals.
LATE CALL lacked speed and was never in contention. CARNIVORE settled just off the leaders outside then- gave way on the final turn.

ALCALA pulled early while racing close up on the inside, steadied at the half mile marker, angled out entering the turn, moved up three wide, rallied outside
of NATURE'S CANDY turning for home, took charge at the furlong marker and drew clear in hand. NATURE'S CANDY was bumped at the start, stalked
close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn, took over, then dueled with the winner into the stretch, was no match for that rival and remained clear for the
place spot. MISSY SIXTYSIX was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and rallied mildly inside for third. JODY'S RUBY vied two wide for the lead,
dueled on the turn and tired. HOP ON ME bobbled and was bumped at the start, trailed the field, raced between rivals on the turn and lacked a rally. BETSY
IS THE GAL bobbled and broke in bumping a rival at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FIRST
JOKE vied inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and gave way.

QUICK TEMPO quickly sped clear opening quarter, eagerly widened in the stretch then was geared down through the final sixteenth. QUICK RETURN
saved ground off the pace, bid outside on the turn and continued gamely for the place. B B BAD trailed far behind then offered some late energy outside.
KATE'S GOLDEN DUDE went after the winner on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. FRIAR TUCK raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter inside
early then gave way readily.

kept to the task. PIT BOSS was bumped and checked after the start, raced three wide early, four wide on the backside, chased on the far turn, came four
wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside and closed well late to get second. ARTISTIC REASON tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied
on the rail in the stretch drive and was outkicked for the place spot. DIXIE'S TWO STENTS raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far
turn and rallied mildly between foes. VISUAL ARTIST was bumped at the start and pulled early, stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened.
