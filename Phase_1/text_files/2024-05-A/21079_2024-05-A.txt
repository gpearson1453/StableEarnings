Footnotes
ASCENDANCE was bumped at the start, settled off the early pace setters racing in hand, was just off the inside approaching the eighth pole, angled out
under left handed urging and finished strongly to edge up under strong handling. GABRIEL SEVEN rated under a firm hold off the early leader, kicked clear
into the upper lane, led inside the sixteenths pole and wore down near the wire to miss in a game effort. GET LIKE MIKE was slow early on to trail,
advanced off the inside around the far turn, swung seven deep into the upper stretch and rallied strongly to the wire. KINGDOM FORCE was bumped at the
start, raced off the early pace, made a four to three wide bid through the stretch run and closed in mildly. KICK STARTNESS settled off the pace, raced four
wide around the far turn and weakened through the drive. DREAM RIVER sprinted clear from the inside and was empty in the drive.

LUTE WARM set a pressured early pace near the rail and held well to edge clear late under strong encouragement. MISCHIEF MOTION pressed two deep
from the outside of Lute Warm and kept on gamely to the wire. MY BLESSING dropped back off the early, advanced four wide around the far turn and
improved position through the drive while racing from the far outside. TALONNADE broke in, bumped with rival at the start, raced four wide around the first
turn, angled in down the backstretch, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and had no late response. DETERMINED FIRST was bumped soundly at the
start, stalked the pace near the inside, raced two wide around the far turn and faded. BOLD LOOK stalked the pace just off the inside, raced three wide
around the far turn and was empty in the drive. UNFOLDING BEAUTY raced far back and was eased up on through the stretch drive.

WORKISLIFE prompt the early pace from the outside, raced four wide around the turns and finished well to hold safe late under steady pressure.
DERBYNESS was unhurried early on, advanced towards the leaders five wide around the far turn and rallied gamely to the wire racing from outside through
the drive. AMERICAN WAR HERO pressed the early pace racing between rivals, shifted out a bit to race four wide and kept on to the wire. GOODBYE
NOTE was shuffled back at the start, rated along the inside under a firm hold, raced three deep near the quarter pole and was even with no closing run.
MAD BANKER set a pressured early pace along the inside and faded. BET THE LINE dropped back early, saved ground around the far turn through the

Footnotes
UNSWAYED coaxed along early, raced two deep around the far turn, eased out into the upper stretch to race from the outside of White Series and finished
well to edge up late under strong handling. WHITE SERIES showed good early foot along the inside to set the early pace and gave way grudgingly late to
the winner. SPERANZAS WILL chased the early pace, had an inside run and finished willingly to the wire. YANGARRA was urged along from the outside,
raced five wide around the far turn and raced even with no closing run. SUPER NEEDY raced two to three wide around the far turn and had no response.
COUSIN GIORGOS was off slowly, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a factor. WATCH OUT WORLD pressed the early leader two
deep from the outside and faded. ALL FRUITS RIPE checked sharply near the seven sixteenths pole and never threatened. IS IT FIVE was off slowly, lag
early to race far back and was eased up on through the drive.

Footnotes
RARIFIED FLAIR tracked the early pace setters from the outside three deep, asked into the upper lane and drew off to be well clear under steady handling.
MARYLAND MOON showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside but was no match for the winner through the drive. LANGLEE AVENUE
stalked the pace setters near the rail down the backstretch and weakened off the top pair through the drive. ROCKLAND EXPRESS prompt the early leader
two deep from the outside and was done early.
