Footnotes
WEST COAST HARBOR vied two wide and between horses into the turn, cleared rivals entering the lane, flopped back to her left lead with a sixteenth to go
and held sway. CHIQUITA REINA prompted three wide and between horses approaching the bend, sustained pressure turning for home, but failed to keep
pace with the leader entering the lane, sustained her chase through the final furlong and saved place from an inner bidder late. IUKA MISS laid off of the
pace in the two path, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, ran on to edge show in the final furlong, sustained progress to bid for place inside of that
position-holder nearing the wire, but missed. DIGITAL CURRENCY chased the leading quartet shifting down to the two path around the turn, shifted to the
four path and between horses entering the lane, ran on to vie for show between horses in the final furlong, but got outkicked. MS I SPEIGHT pressed four
deep into the turn, chased around the bend, lugged inwardly while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch and gradually yielded. MAYLEN raced off of the
pace along the inside and failed to menace. LADLE vied inside of the eventual winner, but gave way turning for home. PAYNT YOUR WAY broke slowly
before shying from an inner rival at the start, trailed early on, advanced five to four wide and outside of foes into the turn, but got floated to the seven path
entering the lane and emptied out. GATHER THE FACTS made little impact from the three path. TAPWRIT WARRIOR trailed in the four path around the
turn and got outrun.

Footnotes
FASTA LAVISTA BABY leaned into an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, leapt over and struck a
fallen foe nearing the lane, recovered to rally in the final furlong and drove past the leaders in the late stages. MOR HAPPY HOURS stalked along the
inside, checked tugging behind foes in the two path down the backstretch, steadied whlie getting floated to the three to four wide and between horses into
the far turn, took aim outside of the leaders in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, led briefly at the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by an outer bidder
late. NOBLE BERNADETTE stalked three wide, forged an advantage getting floated to the four path entering the far turn, had her hind heels clipped by an
inner rival while tucking three wide leaving the five sixteenths pole, vied with an inner rival through midstretch, took contact from that one while getting
headed by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, yielded yet saved show between horses. PITTORE D'ORO lacked speed in the four path before saving
ground around the far turn, shifted out to the three to four path while chasing on her left lead in midstretch, changed leads while running on in the final
sixteenth and missed show. VALERIE BLUE laid off of the pace along the inside, bumped rivals while splitting foes through very tight quarters to attempt a
two wide bid around the far turn, vied along the inside into midstretch, but bumped an outer rival at the sixteenth pole and yielded. AMERICAN MAESTRA
vied along the inside, got headed around the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. K'ANTHEIA pursued from midpack in the two to three path early on,
got hung in the five path around the far turn and tired. LADY JUNE laid off of the pace in the three path and faded wider around the far turn.
TERRITORIALITY took contact from an outer rival at the start, led two wide, then between horses down the backstretch, drifted out a touch into the far turn ,
got headed between counterparts shortly after as an inner rival attempted a bid, clipped an outer rival's hind heels and fell leaving the five sixteenths pole,
then walked off. VOSTRA broke slowly, trailed in the three path, stuck a fallen foe and lost her rider leaving the five sixteenths pole, then walked off.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, VALERIE BLUE WAS DISQUALFIED AND PLACED LAST.

LONG NECK PAULA led tucking two wide into the turn, drew off in upper stretch and was ridden out. MINTY prompted along the inside before stalking
around the turn, shifted off the inner rail whlie claiming place entering upper stretch, then chased the leader home while clear of the rest. MISS MAKENNA
broke out and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path, floated to the six path into upper stretch, ran on to vie for show with an
inner rival and prevailed. MISS ELLE bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, moved two wide and between foes
around the turn before shifting to the five path entering the lane, stayed on to vie for show with an outer rival in the final furlong but was bested. KEYANA
broke a step slow before being bumped by an inner rival and strongly jostled into an outer foe causing her rider to lose his irons, trailed and drifted out
approaching the turn as her rider regained his irons, progressed in the six to eight path around the bend and ran on willingly. LA FANTASTICA took firm
contact from rivals on both sides at the start, lacked speed two wide and between horses, took the turn in the four path, tipped inwardly in upper stretch and
moved up between horses. POUNDS IN TOWN chased forwardly in the three path and yielded. PRECISENESS bumped an inner rival at the start, rushed
forward to prompt the pace three deep around the turn, pressed turning for home, but faded in the four path in upper stretch. CALCETINES raced off of the
pace in the three to four path and between foes around the turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane and failed to factor. SLANDEROUS bumped
with an inner rival at the start, chased along the inside and faded around the turn. EMY was jostled between horses at the start, lacked speed four wide,
trailed in the five path turning for home and was outrun.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT BERTI broke a bit inwardly at the start, tugged forward two wide and between horses while just off of the leaders around the first turn, loomed a
danger pursuing in hand around the far turn, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch and drove past that one passing the sixteenth pole. ROCKY JOY
set the pace along the inside, led from a pair of outer prompters around the far turn, scooted clear in upper stretch, but was collared by an outer bidder
passing the sixteenth pole. CURLIN GUNNER laid off of the pace in the three to five path around the first turn, took closer order before tracking four wide
around the far turn, tipped to the five path in upper stretch and ran on to edge show in the late stages. CHASING KITTY stalked outside of the leading pair
and from the four path, pressed in the three path around the far turn but gave way in upper stretch. HEART OF OSCAR tracked along the inside, chased
turning for home and lacked a bid. TAPIT FOR THE WIN laid off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the five to six path and moved up late. SPOONIE
prompted the leader from the three path, vied in the two path and between horses around the far turn, but faded entering the lane. THERMOSCOPE
pursued from the four to three path and failed to menace. TORNADO ROAD chased in midpack in the three to two path and failed to factor. LUCCHESI
lacked speed three to two wide and failed to factor. MODERN DAY WARRIOR saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. SARPEDON broke slowly and
trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CASTLEWARDEN prompted outside of the leader and in the four path, vied in the two path around the turn, led in hand entering the lane as an outer rival
loomed a danger, was set down to embrace that one's bid in upper stretch, sparred gamely through the final furlong and prevailed via a head-bob. CLASSIC
LEGACY laid off of the pace four wide, was roused within striking range outside of the top pair around the turn, ranged up to bid in upper stretch, dueled
with an inner foe through the final furlong, led narrowly approaching the wire but missed via a head-bob. UNDERHILL'S TAB led inside of a vying rival into
the turn, got headed as a wider foe joined the fray entering the lane, gave way to them leaving the furlong grounds and lasted for show. SHOPPER'S
REVENGE tracked two wide and between horses, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and chased the leaders home. COLD AS HELL stalked along the
inside, chased entering the lane and faded. EARL OF DASSEL pursued three wide and between horses, but faded in the four path around the turn.

GENEROUS LOVER stalked in the four path around the turn, loomed a danger entering the lane in the five path, bid in upper stretch and drove clear.
SASSY WALKER tracked in the four path, tipped to the six path in upper stretch, ran on to edge place at the furlong grounds and was second best. IN
COLOR broke a step slow while last away, raced off of the pace two wide before tucking to the inside around the turn, shifted out while behind the leaders
entering upper stretch, tipped three wide chasing the clearing leader at the three sixteenths pole and stayed on. THREE POLKS pressed the leader from the
three path, led briefly entering the lane before proving no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch, then faded. NEUTRALIZE forged between horses early
on to set the pace along the inside, led from an outer prompter around the turn, got headed nearing the lane and gave way. CHANISA bobbled a bit at the
start, stalked two wide, got floated three wide entering the lane and tired. JUDY ELAINE steadied when briefly keen among foes leaving the chute, raced off
of the pace in the five path and tired. ITSABLINGTHING chased forwardly along the inside, scraped the inner railing and faltered passing the half mile pole
and was outrun. PER ECM2024-159 FROM HIWU, IN COLOR WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
TALL BOY pressed two wide, bid three wide in midstretch, forged an advantage hanging on his left lead in the final furlong and fended off a late outer
bidder. BARBERINI pursued from midpack two to three wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, rallied to range up outside of the leader entering the
final sixteenth, but hung and was denied. RECKONING FORCE bumped with an outer rival before brushing an inner foe at the start, settled well back two
wide, then between horses into and around the far turn, entered the lane in the five path, launched a rally splitting foes in the six path in midstretch, closed in
on the top pair approaching the wire but needed more. MIRANDA RIGHTS stalked along the inside, took aim between the top pair in upper stretch,
attempted to offer a bid at the furlong grounds, but lacked the needed punch and yielded late. DRIPPING GOLD hopped slightly at the start, put to a snug
hold behind foes along the inside early on, saved ground well back, shifted to the three path entering the lane and stayed on willingly among foes.
FREEDOM'S WAY showed the way along the inside, got headed by a pair of rivals at the furlong grounds and gave way. SIR LONDON laid off of the pace
along the inside, took the far turn in the two path, shifted from the five to seven path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. AMERICAN DIAMOND saved
ground off of the pace, took the far turn three wide, floated out six to eight wide in upper stretch and lacked a kick. HE'S GOT SWAGGER lacked speed
three to four wide, floated to the nine path in upper stretch and made little impact. RISK MANAGER took light contact from an outer rival at the start, trailed
along the inside and failed to menace. READY TO PURRFORM tracked two wide, entered the lane in the five path and between horses, and faded.
WOODCOCK FLIGHT (IRE) bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
WEST MEMORIAL chased the top pair from the four to five path, closed in entering midstretch, drove past in the final furlong, cleared and held safely.
STRUMMIN was urged along off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, rallied to reach place in the final sixteenth and narrowed the
gap on his clear stable-mate late. AKINMUSIRE raced off of the pace three wide, bore out entering the turn before recovering shortly after, then stayed on
willingly between horses and achieved show late. SHOOT IT TRUE was very fractious in the starting gate, set the pace in the two path, shook free of an
outer presser in upper stretch, but was overhauled by an outer bidder nearing the final sixteenth and weakened. TUXEDO PARK raced off of the pace along
the inside, shifted two wide entering the lane and failed to menace. MENSA prompted the leader from the three path, gave way in upper stretch and
weakened. TURNBUCKLE was off awkwardly and a few lengths slow, trailed outside of foes before being carried wider by a drifting foe entering the turn,
recovered around the bend but failed to factor. JET SWEEP JOE chased along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
O BESOS broke a bit outwardly, tracked the leading trio from the four to five path, rallied to bid outside of them in midstretch and edged clear in the final
furlong. BOURBON BASH stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, made an early bid for the lead with three furlongs to go, led into the lane
and through upper stretch, but was collared by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds and was second best. SURVEILLANCE set the pace inside of a
prompting rival, got headed by a wider bidder nearing the five sixteenths pole, fought on through upper stretch, gave way to the top pair in the final furlong
and held show. BANGO prompted outside of the leader and from the three path, got outmoved by an outer stalker around the bend, chased between horses
through upper stretch but tired with a sixteenth to go. NECKER ISLAND pursued along the inside and made little impact.

Footnotes
CARL SPACKLER (IRE) stalked outside of the top pair, ranged up to the leader and bid in upper stretch sparking a duel, sparred while brushing his inner
counterpart in the final furlong, then was all out to prevail late. TALK OF THE NATION showed the way while well in hand, dug in to brace for an outer
challenge in upper stretch, dueled into the final furlong, took a brush and flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole, then was grudgingly bested.
SMOKIN' T brushed with an inner foe at the start, tracked along the inside early on, tugged two wide and between horses down the backstretch, stalked
before tipping four wide in upper stretch, then ran on to edge show late. CHURCHTOWN brushed with an outer foe leaving the gates, stalked along the
inside, chased around the far turn, gained show in upper stretch, but only managed to chase the leaders in the final furlong before losing show approaching
the wire. SKYRO brushed with an outer foe at the start, took back from crowded quarters early on, trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the
far turn before tipping to the six path entering the lane, and stayed on to miss fourth. ACCREDIT brushed with an inner rival leaving the gates, settled off of
the pace two wide, then four to five wide around the far turn and lacked a rally between horses. STITCHED pressed two wide and faded between horses
entering upper stretch. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) saved ground off of the pace to no avail. HARLAN ESTATE tracked two to three wide and between horses,
then faded through the lane. TIVERTON (GB) broke a bit out, raced well back in the three to four path before fanning seven wide entering the lane, and
never got involved.

Footnotes
PIKE PLACE tracked in the four path, bid in upper stretch, cleared at the furlong grounds and held sway. HARLEEZY bobbled a bit at the start, pursued
from the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole but needed more to reel in the leader. LONG CROW
raced at the rear three wide, shifted to the six path into upper stretch and ran on willingly. MUCHO MOJO pressed the leader from the three path, led
entering the lane as an outer bidder loomed a danger, got bested nearing upper stretch and gave way. MY ROMEO LIMA set the pace in the two path and
faded in upper stretch. SANT' ANTIMO stalked from the two path into the turn, chased around the bend and gave way. AMERICAN HERO made little
impact two wide. MR. PETERKIN laid off of the pace along the inside and tired.
