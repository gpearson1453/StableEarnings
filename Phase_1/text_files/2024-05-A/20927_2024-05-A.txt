THRILL OF THE NITE led from the start, set the pace from the two path, held safe while being kept to the task. NIGHT FLYER stalked from outside, went
three wide on the turn and encouraged along by the quarter pole, was no match for the winner but held the place. MOHAYMEN DAY settled at the rear
inside, saved ground on the turn, began to shift out late on that bend coming four wide to the top of the stretch, ran on willingly but needed more. BOOTIFUL
ROSE was urged from the start, chased the eventual winner from inside, drew a bit nearer inside that one while in a bit tight nearing the three-sixteenths but
flattened out.

Footnotes
MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA quickly moved clear, set the pace from off the rail, held. OOPS (GB) broke just a step slowly, switched out off the inside bringing
up the rear into the turn, swung five wide leaving that bend, was in a bit tight at the top of the stretch, gained steadily once clear to secure the place but was
too late to reach the winner. ANNAMARIA stalked the eventual winner three to four wide, went evenly in the stretch. BYE BYE CHARLIE tracked in behind
up close to the leader, dropped back from the seven-sixteenths but kept on in the stretch inside. MIDNITE SCORE was encouraged along three furlongs out
racing between runners, drifted out at the top of the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. VIOLENT VIOLET was outpaced early, fanned six wide into the
stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
BON PRIX set the pace from off the rail facing inside pressure early, shook free of that rival to move clear by the five-sixteenths, held sway while being kept
to the task. AMUSING WAY pressed the eventual winner from inside from the outset, lost ground on that one and switched out while being urged along at
the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch five wide, kept on late to secure the place. ESTIFRAAD was outside foes off the leading pair racing three to four
wide, drifted in just a bit in upper stretch, ran on. NORTHERN JEWEL bumped with a foe at the start, was outpaced early racing far back into the turn,
swung out for the drive and finished well but far too late. EXAMINER chased from between foes off the leading pair, came in a bit in upper stretch, ran on.
BEHIND THE CURTAIN broke awkwardly and bumped with a rival at the start, pursued the leaders from inside foes into the turn, saved ground, steadied
slightly when in tight in upper stretch altering outside a drifting rival.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING STRIKING set the pace from outside three wide, drifted a bit in the stretch, held sway while being kept to the task. ALBERTA BERBON
bumped with a foe at the start, showed brief speed temporarily moving to the lead but was soon overtaken, continued to chase from inside before angling
out four wide coming to the quarter pole, kept on in the stretch to secure the place. HARD DIAMOND raced up close early two to three wide, needed more
late. SILENT COUNT bumped with a rival at the start and was consequently slow to gather, advanced up the backstretch into the turn racing off the inside,
continued evenly thereafter. OUR SUNSHINE lacked early speed bringing up the rear racing near the rail, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
KULSUM tracked from near the rail early, ridden along at the seven-sixteenths, shifted four to five wide turning for home, kept on late and surged for the
win. DISTORTED ROSE contended for the early lead then pressed the leader outside two to three deep, bid past the quarter pole taking the lead, led till late
but was outfinished. CRANBERRY CHILL broke a half-step slowly, switched out racing off the inside and advanced five then six deep on the turn, evened
out in the drive. DESTIN TO BE GREAT settled off the pace racing inside, saved ground through the turn, was in tight along the rail in upper stretch, found
room and ran on. SIZZLIN ROSE pursued three to four wide into the turn, steadied just slightly three furlongs out, shifted five to six deep for the drive, ran
on. KATNISS FIRE broke a step slowly, raced well back off the inside part of the track, was never a threat. BURNING UP was very fractious in the gate,
broke well enough to stalk from between runners ni the second flight racing two to three wide into the turn, tired. MY KIND OF NITE contested the pace from
inside a foe just off the rail, faltered in upper stretch after being overtaken.

early speed, saved ground inside on the turn and into upper stretch, passed some tired ones. THUNDER GOLD bumped a rival at the start, raced well back

the back five wide into the turn, fanned eight deep, was never a threat. E PAY ALL THE WAY exchanged several bumps at the start, was urged along to
chase but lacked speed racing off the rail, failed to rally.

wide for the drive, was second best. TOOL TIME exchanged a light bump at the start, had the very early lead but was soon outsprinted, switched out off the
rail entering the turn racing in the two then three path, ran on. KEEN FLATTER exchanged a light bump at the start, was outsprinted early, went four to five
wide on the turn, came out gradually througt the stretch. WAGON TRAIN chased mostly three to four wide into and on the turn, bid past the quarter pole
drawing about even but could not sustain the effort and flattened out, was vanned off. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS had a light bump at the start, was
outsprinted early, raced three to four wide on the turn off the leaders, failed to menace. H K RAPPER exchanged a light bump at the start, chased in behind,
saved ground on the turn, ran on. MOUNT ASGARD was outpaced and never a threat.
