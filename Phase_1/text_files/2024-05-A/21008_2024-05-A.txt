Footnotes
VOLKERT prompted the pace in the four path, bid passing the quarter, swung from the five path into the lane, got herded inwards while holding onto a
narrow lead and dueling with an outer foe passing the eighth pole, and dug in to inch ahead of that foe late. FROSTED FAITH rated in the four path, ranged
up to bid in the six path turning into the stretch, ran on while drifting inwards and dueled with an inner foe into the final furlong, narrowly led passing the
sixteenth, but hung late to place. CHRISTENSEN bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path, received a right handed cue in the five path
midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND set the pace in the three path,
was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, but flattened in the stretch. BEGANINGREENPOINT bumped between foes at the start, stalked inside but
faded in the stretch. SONG RUNNER bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, but steadied going into the turn, and failed to menace.

JABRAN set the pace in the two path and held clear under a mild drive. LIEUTENANT STAN broke slowly, chased the winner from the rail and was clearly
second best. MAYHEMINTHEPALACE chased the winner in the three path and finished evenly to hold the show. RACKET failed to menace while racing
three wide. IMAPEPPA played no factor while racing two wide. MAXIMO was outrun inside. HERMOSO HOMBRE made little impact while racing four wide.

Footnotes
GUAICAIPURO set an open pace in the two path, waited confidently rounding the turn, was roused from the two path into the lane, and held sway. NANDO
tracked inside, was cued along the rail turning into the stretch, and ran on to get up for place. QUEEN VALENTINA laid in range in the two path, was pushed
along around the turn, swung out to the five path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. GIURO stalked in the three path, floated out to the six path
turning into the stretch, and finished evenly on his left lead. PRAISEWORTHY bumped with an outer foe at the start, was held up in the four path, angled to
the rail going into the turn, tipped back out to the four path while being cued into the lane, but made no impact. MOR SPRING SPIRIT got rank as the gates
opened and broke slowly, trailed in the four path, waited in the two path around the turn, and made no impact. ICELANDER chased in the three path, angled
out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but did not factor. PARAKEET (IRE) was hustled in midpack from the four path but did not threaten. ALWAYS
DIALED bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the five path but never menaced.

lead, but rallied past an inner pair late. BLACK BELT BARBIE set the pace in the two path, received a right handed cue midway around the far turn, floated
out to the four path turning into the stretch, dug in to fight off an outer foe, but was caught by another outer foe late to place. BAHA SECRET tracked inside,
tipped out to the three path midway around the turn, bid passing the quarter, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on, but hung to
show. KOZEM chased in the five path but never threatened. NAUGHTY FAVORS broke out at the start, prompted the pace in the four path but yielded
around the turn.

Footnotes
COSMIC SPECULATION set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch, drifted out late and held safe. STORMY VICTORY raced off the pace two
wide, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. BORN A GAMBLER saved ground in range, tipped three wide in upper stretch and could
only gain mildly. THE DOORMAN saved ground off the early pace, went four wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly outside. UNCAPTURED BOY
prompted the winner two wide and weakened in the drive. FAST N STEADY chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. ENSIGN SKIP trailed two
wide.
