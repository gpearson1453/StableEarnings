KATHLEEN O. raced off the pace inside, then two wide, chased on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside and was going best late
for the win. OCCULT raced three wide on the first turn, moved up to press the pace, bid two wide, dueled on the far turn, gained command nearing the
quarter pole, led into the stretch, then drifted in in front of VENTI VALENTINE nearing the furlong marker bothering that rival, then drifted out at the sixteenth
marker, dug in to the finish and yielded to the winner. VENTI VALENTINE raced three wide early, then set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn,
dropped back a bit, was attempting to re rally, then was forced to check sharply when lacking room behind OOCULT nearing the eighth pole, rallied mildly
inside after that. FROSTY O TOOLE stalked outside, three wide on the backside, chased three wide on the far turn, made a bid at the quarter pole, rallied
mildly, was between rivals in the stretch run, steadied slightly at the sixteenth marker and outkicked. TRAVERSE away alertly in front of the field, then was
rated back off the pace, tracked inside, chased inside on the far turn, raced evenly in the stretch and was steadied near the sixteenth marker. After the race,
a Stewards' Inquiry was posted, along with rider's objections, VENTI VALENTINE and FROSTY O TOOLE against OCCULT, TRAVERSE against the
winner, OCCULT was disqualified and placed third.
