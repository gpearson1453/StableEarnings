SNAP DECISION stalked the pace from the start, gained ground after the fourteenth fence to draw even, assumed command at the fifteenth fence, was
challenged by VAE PATRON (FR) at the final fence and rallied for the win. VAE PATRON (FR) led at the start through 2 1/2 miles, gave way to SNAP
DECISION before the fifteenth fence, rallied to draw close to the leader at the final fence, fought gamely in the stretch to just miss. ZABEEL CHAMPION
(GB) rated through 2 1/2 miles, rallied after the fifteenth fence and passed rivals in the stretch for show. SEBASTOPOL (IRE) raced midpack, bid after the
fifteenth fence to gain lengths, jumped the final fence in fourth and held well in the stretch. NOAH AND THE ARK (IRE) was reserved through fourteen

factor.
