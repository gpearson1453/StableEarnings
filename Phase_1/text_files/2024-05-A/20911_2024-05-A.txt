Footnotes
FORT BONZ reserved in hand for the first half mile, gained ground into the final turn while saving ground along the fence, angled out five wide at the head
of the lane to engage the leader in upper stretch, battled that one to the wire and prevailed in a determined drive. FLASHING ANGELBABY stalked the pace
down the backside, challenged the pacesetter on the far turn, shook off that on turning for home, was immediately engaged by the winner, battled through
the lane gamely and was outkicked late. HANKS set the pace on a clear lead to the far turn, dueled through the turn, could not go with the top pair and kept
on down the lane to hold the show. IT'S A BIRD tracked the leaders and made a mild rally in the lane to hit the board. QUARTER RAT unhurried early,
angled nine wide at the top of the lane and closed late. HAPPY BOY ROCKET contended down the backside while racing five wide and went evenly.
SABER RUN tracked the leaders to the far turn to be well palced turning for home and lacked a response when called upon. CAJUN CONNECTION chased
the early pace from the fence and faded. MIDNIGHT CROWN was not a factor.

Footnotes
PICKIN ANA GRINNIN stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, rallied on the bend to assume command nearing the quarter pole, quickly opened a
clear advantage and kept on unthreatened down the lane. MUCHMORETHANREADY unhurried for the first half mile to be at the rear of the main body of
the field, swept up six wide on the far tun with a big move and failed to sustain the rally down the stretch. MISS DARLENE tracked the leaders throughout to
be well placed and finished evenly lacking a closing rally. LA VIKINA shied at the start to be slow early, moved up to race mid-pack down the backstretch
and went one-paced. SAENZ pressed the pace from between rivals to the far turn and flattened out. SERAPE set the pace for the first five-eighths and gave
way. CHEROKEE SUMMER was outrun.

Footnotes
UNCLE FRANK prompted the pace for the first half mile, move to engage the leader into the turn, took command turning for home, was engaged by the
runner-up in mid-stretch, battled with that one and edged away nearing the wire. BUBBA CAN DANCE rated in mid-pack to the far turn, rallied three wide in
a steady advance to challenge the leader in mid-stretch and finished willingly unable to overcome the winner. FAHAN slow early to be the distant trailer,
commenced a rally on the final bend, circled the field and closed belatedly on the far outside. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY tracked the leaders for
three-quarters and finished evenly failing to mount a closing rally. JAZZY JUSTIN set the pace under pressure for a half and gradually gave way. FIELD OF
VISION was loose pre-race from the gate, chased the pack early and dropped out as a non-factor.

Footnotes
KATIES FACTOR prompted the pace for the first three-eighths, took command on the turn, opened a clear lead turning for home and held sway through the
lane. JESS'S RAINBOW tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied four wide under a steady, grinding advance and was gaining late on the winner.
BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY stalked the pace to be in striking distance turning for home and lacked a closing kick. ROSIE SPRIT raced in mid-pack evenly
and passed weakened rival in the lane. WHO DAT GINGER sped to the early lead and was through after a half mile. BOSTON BELLE was not a threat.
ANGEL AND ME was difficult to load pre-race and was outrun from the start.

ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE pressed the pace to the head of the lane, assumed command turning for home and drew off through the lane determinedly.
TRIPPLE D RULLER stalked the pacesetters through the turn, rallied four wide at the head of the lane to threaten and kept on willingly. ORLEANS
TOURIST trailed to the quarter pole and made up ground in the stretch to be best of the rest. TACTICAL PRIORITY unhurried early to be near the back of
the field and went evenly passing weaker rivals in the stretch. EMPIRE KID set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and faded in the drive. THE BOYZ
PRIORITY chased the pace to midway on the turn and flattened out.

Footnotes
CLEARLY A TEST stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied three wide to take control at the top of the lane and prevailed in a determined drive in a
well handled ride. EMILY'S BULLET unhurried in the early going to be near the back of the pack, commenced a rally midway on the bend circling six wide to
be gaining down the lane and surged late to just miss. LIGHTOFMAINE prompted the pace to the turn, tipped out to make a two wide bid on the turn to
challenge for the lead from between horses, battled through the lane and was outfinished in deep stretch in a game effort. ISLAND GOLD reserved off the
pace, was set to a long drive on the turn and responded with a mild rally. WONDERRAND broke a step slow to be the trailer and rallied in the lane showing
late interest. GUITAR SOLO sped to the lead while well in hand, held a clear advantage for a half and folded when challenged nearing the quarter pole.
RUNNING ARGUMENT tracked the leaders from four wide and lacked a response when called upon. MY LUCKY BREAK was through after a half mile.

CHROME BABY hustled away from the gate to hold the inside position on the first turn, continued to press from the inside in the three path down the
backside, fully engaged the leader turning for home, dueled with the pacesetter to midway down the lane and asserted control late to pull away in a well
managed ride. BEHEMAH STAR broke alertly to set the pace into the first turn from four wide, continued to set a pressured pace to the top of the lane while
drifing out, battled the winner to deep stretch and was outkicked late while an evident second best. WHO TOOK THE MONEY slow early to be the trailer,
swung wide coming home and rallied on the outside to be along for the show. ALEX JOON stalked the pacesetters from five wide down the backstretch and
lacked a response when called upon on the final turn and finished evenly. MONAASIB tracked the leaders from the inside for the first half and gradually
faded. SEDUCTIVE U S A went evenly as a non-factor.

Footnotes
NONEYA settled between rivals to be reserved off the early pace, rallied four wide on the turn to be well placed turning for home, angled to the clear in
upper stretch and closed well to be up in deep stretch. CHARLIE T broke alertly to be in front, raced from two wide pressing the pacessetter through the
turn, took command at the head of the lane, responded willingly down the stretch and was unable to hold off the closing winner. BLESSED ASSURANCE
slow early to be the trailer, split rivals while rallying in upper stretch and finished well to be gaining late. BELEOUT reserved off the pace through the turn
and made a steady advance from midway on the turn to be closing ground in the stretch. NORAH G set a pressured pace from the inside to upper stretch
and kept-on down the lane while gradually weakening. FIRST I'VE SEEN unhurried for the first half and passed tiring rivals in the lane. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN
went evenly without impact. FINAL QUEST stalked the pace from five wide and faded coming home. RUE LALA raced in early contenetion from five wide
and lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
HAMMERIN AAMER unhurried for the first five-eighths to be near the rear of the field, made a six wide steady rally midway on the turn, was gaining through
the lane and found his best stride late to surge nearing the wire and be up in time. SPHEROID pressed the pace to the far turn, took the lead nearing the
quarter pole, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and was caught late in the lane. BIG POWER RED stalked the pace from three wide to upper stretch and
rallied mildly down the lane to gain the show. NATE'S ATTACK reserved off the pace for the first half mile, rallied on the turn and failed to sustain the bid
through the stretch. DEALIN' STELEN trailed most of the way and passed weakened rivals in the lane. SMOKY TOPAZ set a ppressured pace for
three-quarters and tired in the stretch. TURN ON THE MAGIC hard to load pre-race, raced in contention along the rail down the backside and faded in the
far turn.
