Footnotes
CHROME RACER stalked the pace around the first turn then pressed the pace to the top of the stretch and took command at the eighth pole and drew
clear. LADY YELLOWSTONE broke out slightly and went to the front to set the pace, was challenged through the final turn but proved second best. ALMA'S
PRINCESS settled in the middle of the pack on the inside but was no match for the top two. THAROLITE was steadied after leaving the gate then rushed up
from three wide around the first turn to be forwardly placed but was never a threat. FULL MOON BEACH raced off the pace from the two path around the
first turn then dropped back on the backstretch and was never a factor. SHEZONEZESTREET was steadied at the six furlong marker and was always back.

JUDY CALLS rushed up the rail to take the early lead and dueled for the lead to the quarter pole but was overtaken and fended off inside rival to hold the
place. OH NIKI raced near the back through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch and just missed the place. GYPSY ROSE raced four wide and was
gaining late to improve position. EUTYCHIA was always back. GOSPEL SISTER showed the early foot, then stalked the pace from three wide but lacked
the late response. STOLEN KISSES was off a step slow, saved ground to mid turn then angled out but didn't have a rally.

the stretch. WEST JET vied for the lead around the first turn then settled off the pace on the inside to the top of the stretch, angled out at the eighth pole but
was no match for the winner. DR VINNIE BOOMBATZ saved ground while settling in the middle of the pack then made a late bid in the stretch to be up for
the show. PATRIOTIC DUTY steadied going into the first turn and raced near the back around the first turn then steadily advanced from three to four wide
through the final turn, angled in at the top of the stretch and made a late rally. MINGUS went to the front to take an early lead around the first turn then raced
off the pace down the backstretch, made a mild bid on the final turn but faded in the stretch. WRISTBAND vied for the lead from three wide to the quarter
pole and retreated. PRINCE CAROLINA J raced in the middle of the pack and made a mild bid four wide bid on the final turn and flattened out. SKYFLYER
raced in the middle of the pack and failed to menace. TRAFFIC BOSS raced near the back around the first turn then was checked at the six furlong marked
and remained back. GOSPEL DANDY stalked the pace from four wide to the top of the stretch and gave way.
