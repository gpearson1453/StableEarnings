around the far turn and chased on to the wire. THE LADY BULLS EYE saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch,
navigated the second turn from the three path and finished evenly. CUPIE CUTIE hopped up leaving the gate and was away from the gate awkwardly, raced
