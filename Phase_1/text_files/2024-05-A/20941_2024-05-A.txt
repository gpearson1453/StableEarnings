Footnotes
TRAFFIC MASTER hugged the inner rail in hand patiently waiting, eased out to the three path in mid stretch, closed, led late and drove clear. MARGIE'S
FUN SON lacked speed, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied. COURT CONTENDER , a forward factor in the three path around the turn, swept
to the lead in upper stretch, opened up in mid stretch and tired in the drive. HURRYING HOME raced in the two path between horses on the turn, angled out
in upper stretch and lacked the necessary response. INSPIRED IRISH hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and faded. NICO LUCKY ,
four deep under urging on the turn, gave way. WESLEY THOMAS dueled outside INSPIRED IRISH and faltered.

Footnotes
HARD TRAVELER , patiently handled while saving ground early, eased out and edged up between foes near the half, dropped back in near the lane, snuck
through along the inside past the three sixteenths to take command, spurted clear under a drive then held sway. LONGWORTH , five wide early attending
the pace, drafted in a bit and dueled three wide outside SO SMOOTH around the turn, shifted out a bit wider into the lane and came back on in game
fashion. SIMON'S CHOICE secured the inside early and rated close up off the contested pace, slipped through towards the inner rail past the three eighths
and assumed command, went clear while guided off the inside in upper stretch, failed to contain the winner's inside bid and weakened through the final
sixteenth. TRUE ACCOUNT , six wide early while ion range, stalked four wide under a ride nearing the lane and faded. TORTOLA , well off the inside,
dropped back around the turn then came up empty in the drive. SO SMOOTH was sent up to the inside of rivals and took over leaving the chute, dropped in
to about the two path while pressured into the turn, dueled to the inside of LONGWORTH around the turn, failed to go on in upper stretch and retreated.

BISCUITWITHTHEBOSS broke sharply and had speed towards the inner rail, stayed on after being headed into the turn, dueled with RAPIDO ROSA from
the quarter pole, gained a slim advantage a sixteenth out, kept on under right handed asking and prevailed. SAFE TRUST , very reluctant to load, hustled
up outside rivals soon after the break, attended the pace three deep past the five sixteenths, finished up gamely and just missed. RAPIDO ROSA brushed at
the break, rushed up between foes and put a head in front entering the turn, battled outside the winner from the quarter pole to deep stretch and gave way
grudgingly between horses. PURE MAJESTIC hit the outer portion of her stall at the break, regrouped and chased the leading trio while saving ground,
remained inside for the drive and faded. RAVENEX broke outward brushing with a foe, corrected to and flashed speed, appeared a bit green early on and
dropped back between foes into the turn, saved ground nearing the lane but came up empty. BELMONTIS , off slowly when brushed at the start, dropped
well off the early pace, raced outside RAVENEX nearing the lane and failed to respond.

Footnotes
VON HOFF , steadied in traffic approaching the five eighths pole, circled the turn four to five deep, drifted to the eight path in upper stretch, closed while on
his left lead, led late and drew clear. BARON'S LEGACY disputed the pace outside DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE around the turn, sprinted clear in mid stretch
and gave way grudgingly. GUAPONESS , along the inner rail waiting for room around the turn, eased over to the two path in upper stretch and finished
gamely inside horses. QUINCANNON , a forward factor in the two path between horses on the turn, remained between rivals in the lane and lacked the
needed rally. THATAWAY bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, drifted out in upper stretch and failed to sustain his bid. KATIE'S
NOTION saved ground around the turn, remained inside horses in the stretch and failed to menace. THE GREAT GAZOO , steadied in tight quarters near
the five and a half furlongs pole, was not a factor. DUBLSHOTOFCOURAGE showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace to mid stretch and gave
way. OROCOVIX , three wide chasing the pace along the turn, gave way.

PASSIONED , under snug rating three wide and within range of the leaders, moved up between rivals and under a ride to threaten into the lane, dueled on a
slim lead to the inside of WORK HARD from the three sixteenths past mid stretch then edged away late under a drive. WORK HARD lost ground four wide,
moved up outside rivals and under coaxing past the five sixteenths, bid three deep into the lane, battled outside the winner then gave way grudgingly in the
final seventy yards. VILALUZ rated inside early on, eased out to move between foes, dropped back in then steadied when stalled behind the leading trio
nearing the lane, shifted out, drifted in pursuing near mid stretch then came up empty. HONOR THE CROSS hustled to a short early lead, dueled inside a
rival around the turn and into the backstretch, eased back of foes to stalk, was caught between runners leaving the far turn, dropped back near the five
sixteenths, swung out about five wide then churned on. WESTEROS vied two wide early then rated back a bit before rebidding to the inside of BERMUDA
RUN, dueled with that one into the far turn, failed to kick on near the five sixteenths and weakened. BERMUDA RUN was used four wide around the first
turn to reach contention then poke a head in front leaving the three quarter pole, dueled outside WESTEROS into the far turn, briefly shook clear, was joined
by two outer rivals near the quarter pole, stayed with effort to mid stretch then weakened.

Footnotes
STRIKER HAS DIAL sped clear early and set a rated pace off the inside, was joined from her outside leaving the half mile marker, spurted away past the
five sixteenths, opened up after being put to some firm asking in upper stretch then cruised home through the final sixteenth. SHINING SPIRIT , urged along
four wide chasing the pace, shifted out near mid stretch, continued on with effort and out kicked an inner rival for the place. LOTTIE DENO edged up leaving
the chute then angled out to stalk the winner, moved up to force the issue with a half mile remaining, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, gave hard
chase into the stretch and gave way grudgingly. ENEMYNUMBERNINE settled off the pace while saving some ground, eased out with a mild run into the
stretch, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. NO MORE KISSES saved ground in pursuit of the leaders, failed to go on nearing the lane and weakened.
BISCUIT , five wide, stayed in touch to the turn then retreated.

Footnotes
QUIT QUAY showed speed then was rated back off the leaders, saved ground into the turn, eased out then knifed between runners and joined the fray mid
turn, dueled briefly to the inside of MONTANA ROSE, shook clear into the lane, opened up under asking in mid stretch then just cruised home through the
final sixteenth. MONTANA ROSE had speed then eased back off the keen leader, stalked three wide into the turn, bid soon after, battled three wide outside
the winner heading to the stretch, failed to match strides in upper stretch but held well to be clear of the rest. EXTRA DIRTY bore out into KANEM at the
break, corrected and settled off the inside, shifted out advancing in upper stretch then came up empty. HAPPYINITIATIVE lacked speed, raced well wide in
the drive and got by faders. PAPERBACK EDITION , four wide, edged up to take aim past the three eighths, failed to kick on under asking in upper stretch
and weakened. KANEM , bumped and pinched back at the break, was outrun. DIVINE SPIRIT , hard sent inside to go clear, set the pace towards the inner
rail, was joined leaving the far turn, stayed on past the five sixteenths then began a retreat.
