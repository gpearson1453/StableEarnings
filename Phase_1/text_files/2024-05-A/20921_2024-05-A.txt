Footnotes
BODACIOUS hustled clear to take control opened up along the inside on the turn and remained well clear under steadily handling through the lane in a
sharp debut. R HEISMAN off a bit slow and inward to begin, had to take hold when lacked room early, continued to find traffic on the turn and altered out to
the three path, finished willingly down the lane but could not make any headway on the winner. KEEP DANCIN NICK chased two wide into the turn, moved
to the rail around the bend then moved back out a bit approaching the stretch, steered out in the lane and was along for the show. HOW ABOUT PAVEL
tracked two wide into the turn, got floated out to the four path then cut back down to the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. SIR NANO
chased from outside, rounded the bend three then two wide and weakened under asking. MR. MACHUPICCHU chased along the rail, drifted out past the
quarter pole, moved back inside at the top of the stretch and weakened. A VOTRE SANTE broke a step slow, hustled early chasing three deep, angled in
while trailing on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BEAUTIFUL JANET stalked in the two path then on the inside around the first turn, moved closer on the backstretch, angled out into the clear at the
five-sixteenths pole to take aim at the top pair, bid three deep into the stretch, dueled outside WARREN'S SHOWGIRL through the lane and dug in late to
prevail. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL raced up close four wide on the first turn, pressed the leader from outside in the middle stages, drew on even terms on the
far turn, took a short lead late on the bend, put away inner rival entering the stretch but now had to battle with BEAUTIFUL JANET to the outside, fought
head to head through the lane and was edged at the wire. CLASSY sped to the front two to three wide inside rivals on the clubhouse turn, showed the way
under pressure up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, chased the top pair into the lane, weakened in the drive but managed to save third. LADY
CRUISER was off slow from inside, saved ground through both turns, chased a bit off the rail into the lane and could not threaten while earning a minor
award. MISS ALLURE chased five then four wide early, took the second turn three to four wide and failed to rally. MAX'S MAXINE got crowded a bit leaving
the gate, went three wide into the first turn then had to check off heels of a rival late on the bend, trailed up the backstretch, passed a tired rival while racing
two then three wide on the far turn and was never a factor. FAST INVESTMENT prominent early three to four wide on the first turn then dropped back off
the pace, trailed four wide into the lane and failed to menace.

two path, bid three deep on the far turn, dueled down the lane and got outkicked. DON'T SWEAR DAVE rated on the fence early, bid two wide on the far
turn, led in upper stretch but also got outkicked. LOW EXPECTATIONS stalked outside a rival, drew closer on the backstretch, remained two wide on the far
turn and lacked a response. ENJOY IT STRAIT settled early saving ground along the rail, moved out a bit at the top of the stretch and flattened. TULANE

REALLY THIRSTY dueled for the lead outside O MANDY, battled into the final furlong, kicked clear midstretch and held well. HAYLEY AMBER stalked the
top pair off the inside, took aim three wide leaving the turn, then finished willingly to closed the gap on the winner while gaining second. O MANDY dueled
from inside to the eighth pole, failed to kick on with the winner in the furlong grounds and lost second. HOLLYWOOD PENNY chased between rivals early
then two wide, tipped out in upper stretch and improved position. TRULY MAGICAL came in at the start, trailed along the inside to the stretch, moved out
only to find traffic in upper stretch, gained a clear path but could not threaten. MOOREA TIME lugged in and bumped rival across the dirt, stalked four then
three deep up the backstretch, rounded the bend three then two wide and lacked the needed response. DANZIG TIL DAWN chased along the inside to the
stretch and faded down the lane.

the stretch, cleared approaching the eighth pole and was kept to task to the wire. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR stalked the top pair early, bid two wide on the far
turn, carried a short lead into the stretch, yielded to the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. SPEED GRAZY tracked the leaders three
wide into the first turn, chased along the rail then two wide on the far turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch lacked then needed late kick but churned on to
hold third. THE BIG WAM trailed on the inside early, made progress around the far turn, moved off the rail in the lane and missed third. MAN OVERBOARD

Footnotes
STOP DIGGING got crowded between rivals early, stalked outside a rival, took aim two wide entering the lane, challenged in upper stretch and proved best
in the final furlong. MIZ CLUBCALI sat off the pace three deep, came in a bit to brush PLAY MY SPEED midway around the turn, had to pause when
running into traffic late on the bend, moved off the fence in the lane, rallied but lost his path past the eighth pole, altered inward and finished well for second.
SMILING FOREVER dueled for the lead from outside then cleared leaving the backstretch, set the pace to the stretch, challenged in upper stretch, fought to
midstretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. DANZINGWITH MAXINE tracked off the rail, spun three wide into the lane and needed to find more late.
ISABEL LUDLOW trailed early and moved inside, altered out at the five-sixteenths pole and improved position. LOVELY IDAHO dueled from inside, chased
the leader into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. PLAY MY SPEED sat off the pace, chased between runners into the turn, got forced
into inner rival and checked at the five-sixteenths pole and could not recover. SHOOT FOR THE SKY lost path early then settled off the pace, moved closer
under coaxing inside a pair of rivals, got bumped and put in tight making him check at the five-sixteenths pole and was not persevered with after. THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED MIZ CLUBCALI FROM SECOND TO LAST FOR FORCING PLAY MY SPEED INTO SHOOT FOR THE SKY NEAR THE
FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE, CAUSING BOTH RIVALS TO CHECK AND COSTING THEM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
