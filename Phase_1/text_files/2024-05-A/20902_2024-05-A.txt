Footnotes
ONE CANDY CASTLE settled in the three path the opening turn, started his bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved steadily, raced in the three
path on the far turn, took the nod entering the stretch, dueled clear past the sixteenth pole and held on well. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE stalked inside, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew close at the rail on the far turn, but relented in the duel through the stretch. CURB THAT TIGER came away
awkwardly and raced off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved, raced in the three path on the far turn, angled out
entering the stretch and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole. DIRECT THE SHOW stalked from the three path, challenged toward the three
eighths pole and took the nod approaching the five sixteenths, contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn but was met entering the stretch and
flattened mid-stretch. SUGAR LIPS saved ground racing well back from early contention, gave chase approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the five path, left the turn widest and passed some rivals. ASTRAYAL raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened stride. THUNDERHOUSE rounded the opening turn in the three path, picked up the chase leaving the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. DR RENDEZVOUS was reluctant to load, raced in the five path the first
turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened in the five path on the far turn. LOVETHEBAND showed little response. STORMI
VANNA took a quick early lead and angled to the inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths, remained
a close factor into the far turn but checked in tight at the rail approaching the eighth pole and gave way.

Footnotes
JACKYSINTHECASTLE stalked inside, bid at the rail into the far turn, eased out entering the stretch and dug in to take over late yards. VAN HOOK stalked
inside on the first turn, closed to the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole and contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, dug in from the
head of the lane but was outfinished through later yards. JUST HAVE FAITH settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, left the turn outside and came along for third late yards. PRINCESS HALO was bumped lightly leaving the
gate then rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the four path on the far
turn but flattened stride in the stretch. STRONG WILLED stalked from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced close in the three
path on the far turn but weakened approaching mid-stretch. POUR ME A DRINK rounded the opening turn about the three path, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. LIL BOUGIE broke awkwardly and made light contact with Princess Halo then took the lead two deep past
the five eighths pole, was met toward the seven sixteenths and gave close chase through the backstretch but faded readily in the three path on the far turn.

Footnotes
BLAMEITONTHEFUN took the lead in the three path nearing the seven eighths pole and rated the pace, responded to the challenge of Mr Hoover leaving
the seven sixteenths pole, contested even terms nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold off the stretch challenge of PYEONG
CHANG, who settled close inside and started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to even terms in the three path midway on the far
turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. JUMPSTER settled in the four path early, left the second turn outside and bid nearing the three
eighths pole, steadily improved from that point, raced in the four path on the far turn and came along to take third mid-stretch. MR HOOVER stalked the
pace inside, challenged leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, then flattened in the lane. NEVER CHANGE saved
ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. WELLING settled off the pace about the
three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. URBAN BANDIT was never a factor. JAMMIN STILL raced about the
four path on the turns and was through after a half mile.

QUEEN JELLY BEAN stalked inside leaving the five eighths pole, challenged past the half mile pole and dueled clear toward the quarter, raced at the rail on
the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. NONESUCH GIRL stalked three wide the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn off the rail and settled for second. SYBARITE settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. SOMEBODY LOVES ME dropped well back from contention, steadily made up ground past the three
eighths pole, angled out approaching the head of the lane and improved her position in a strong finish. BAHITI saved ground early, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out approaching the head of the lane and showed little further. GOLDEN STAR took the lead
two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole and dueled from that point, but dropped back at the
quarter and weakened at the rail on the far turn. LINDA'S TAJ raced off the rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and faded past the three eighths
pole.

Footnotes
SPECIAL KAYLEE gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the four path on the turn and dug in the final furlong to take over the closing yards.
BLUSHING BIP BOP became fractious behind the gate then ducked in and hit the stall door at the break, set a pressured pace inside, contested the edge at
the rail on the turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was caught in the final yards. BIT OF BLESSINGS engaged in close chase and
factored in the three path on the turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. CEDAR'S IMAGE gave chase outside, raced in the six path on the
turn and finished well to close the gap. SWISS HORIZON gave chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened stride later yards. BOLD INDY
chased, raced in the three path on the turn, eased outward leaving the turn and showed little in the lane. OUR BREW engaged in close early chase but
faded in the three path on the turn. LOCKDOWN VANNA was taken to the outside while being kept in check and raced wide on the turn. Both Juniper Grace
and Fantasy Frost were returned to the paddock for a late change of rider, but were eventually withdrawn.
