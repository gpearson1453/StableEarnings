FORCIBLE ENTRY was off mid pack, raced along the rail and smartly saved ground, was urged at the three eights pole, challenged for the lead in the turn,
matched strides with the pace setter until the quarter pole, was given his cue and responded well drawing away from the field and winning in a convincing
manner. HE GOTS TO GO raced mid pack on the far outside, tracked along in the four path, was urged through the turn, improved position, found his best
stride late as he closed in on the leaders getting up for second. DOCE DE LA NOCHE was off in the middle of the field, raced in the two and three path,
shifted out at the quarter pole, closed well but had too much ground too make up for the win but did get up in time to score third place honors. FLASHY
LOVER was sharp out of the gate, vied for the lead, attended the early pace, was challenged through the turn by an inside attacker, battled with this foe until
the quarter pole then gave way shortly after that. HUMOR ME PLEASE was off mid pack, raced in between rivals in the four path, maintained position but
was never able to get involved. MECKES PRIORITY vied for the lead, settled into a stalking position, raced on the far outside, was in contention through out
but gave way during the stretch drive. CHIEF KIMOSABI was off a touch slow and had no impact. FREE DROP ROB vied for the lead, showed brief speed

Footnotes
TOUCHUPONASTAR took an early lead, raced on the fence, coasted along with his ears up as he made the turn, was briefly aware of another horse
entering the stretch drive, extended his stride and pulled away, putting another win in his column. COSMIC TRAIN laid off of the pace and tracked along the
rail, stayed with in reach, advanced through the turn, tried to challenge his stable mate at the top of the lane but could not get close to the eventual winner
but followed him home running second. BALLINONABUDJET tracked two lengths behind the leader in second place, maintained the same position and
pace, slipped back to finish third. BUDRO TALKING raced in the two path, moved up and stalked briefly, went wrong and broke down into a jog and
eventually pulled up in the stretch. WALKED OFF.

moved up through the turn, angled out into the eight path down the lane, hooked three other competitors and ensued in a battle to the wire for second place
where STRONG PROMISE was the victor. TDZSHININLUCKYSTAR raced off of the pace, raced in the three path and in between other rivals, moved at the
half pole, advanced down the lane, hooked three other rivals late all battling for second place, just missed settling for third. TAKE CHARGE J J stalked the
pace from the three path, raced in between rivals, improved through the turn, hooked three others and engaged in a four way battle for second place late in
the stretch and just missed running fourth. SAINT GABRIEL was off slow, raced on the rail, saved ground, advanced through the turn, made one run, gained
ground with every stride, moved up the rail into a four way battle for second, finishing a disappointing fifth, not getting beat by more than a saddle towel for
second. EL REAL DEAL vied for the lead, attended the pace and faltered in the lane. OTRA COSA flashed early speed, raced on the rail then stopped.

horses late getting up for the win. SHARP CHARLIE vied for the lead, took control and the lead, set the pace and showed the way passed the eighth pole
and almost to the wire but was caught late and settled for second place honors. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN vied for the lead, settled into a stalking position,
maintained that position through out and just missed for second finishing third. MANGUM was off a bit slow, quickly moved up into mid pack, lost ground
through the turn then cam back again down the stretch getting up for fourth. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE raced mid pack and five wide, ran an even race. BLACK
SWORD raced on the rail, was mid pack then faded. GRUNT flashed early speed then stopped. LIKE THIS mid pack four wide, never got involved. WILD
