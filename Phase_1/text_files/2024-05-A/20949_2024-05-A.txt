KEEPING IT COUNTRY prompt the early pace between rivals early, raced five deep in the stretch run and finished well to edge clear under strong handling.
CHARGE TO VICTORY stalked the pace, raced near the rail past the quarter pole, was three deep in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. LOST IN
NEWYORK set a pressured early pace along the inside and weakened through the drive. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was off slowly, raced near the rail around
the far turn through the stretch run and had not enough. PORTAL ONE settled off the early going, swung six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.
NOBLE JON was forced to check sharply in the early stages, chased three deep and faded.

NO EASY ANSWER showed good early foot to set the pace and held well under strong handling. JACK'S LILLY dropped back off the early pace, moved up
near the rail around the far turn, shifted out a path to raced just off the inside late and rallied for the place position. ASHLEE'S RING chased the early leader
two deep, raced four wide in the stretch run and kept on willingly to the wire. SIMPLE SOUVENIR dropped back early, raced five to six wide into the upper
stretch and had no response. BELLA PRIMA stalked the pace along the inside and tired readily.

ride. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN stalked the pace, raced two wide near the quarter pole and was no match for the winner in the drive. TAPORICAL was off
slowly, chased the pace three wide from the outside of rivals, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly late with no closing bid on the
top pair. NORTHWOODS tracked the pace along the inside and faded. GRUMPY BROOKSIE was off slowly, lost ground while trailing and lacked a bid.

settle early on, moved up through the far turn from the outside, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the drive. SPINNING

pace setters, had an inside run and no late response. FORLOVEOFCOUNTRY lag early on to trail, swung wide into the upper stretch and never was a
factor. TWIXTER raced five wide around the first turn, checked nearing the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the drive. PRATT failed to respond.
