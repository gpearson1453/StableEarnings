Footnotes
JULIE'S FERRARI off slowly saved ground to upper stretch firing on the rail surging clear late. SUTTON VALLEY pressed the pace shaking clear on the
turn digging in down the lane being run down from the inside late. KANTPAYTHETOLL off slowly lagged to upper stretch finding belated stride to close after
the fact on the rail. MAGIC MOUNTAIN pressed then chased to upper stretch weakening late four wide. PRETTY STORMY played no factor. CHOPPED
was never involved. CRACK THE MOON faded on the turn.
