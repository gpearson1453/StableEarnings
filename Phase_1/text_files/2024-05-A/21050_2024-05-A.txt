Footnotes
GIMME THE CANDY vied for the early lead from the three path then settled off the pace around the turn but came again with a three wide bid and cruised
past the leaders and drew off for the win. MAHONEY ROAD shared the command from the inside to the top of the stretch and was overtaken by an outside
rival but kept on to be second best. WIN OVER WYATT raced near the back while saving ground then angled out on the turn to be three or four wide in the
stretch and made the late rally to be up for show. ALIBI IKE raced in the middle of the pack but failed to menace. HAYHAYCAPTAIN JAC was off a step
slow then raced in the middle of the pack but was never a threat. ANCIENT MAN showed no early speed while racing wide throughout and passed a tiring
rival. SECESSION shared the command from the two path to the top of the stretch and faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
WEST ISLAND sprinted to the lead to set all the pace, edged away into the stretch and was kept to task in the drive. CHARLIE LIGHTNING vied for the lead
from two wide to mid turn and was no match for the winners but proved second best. FUTURE VISION raced near the back while saving ground, angled out
in upper stretch and made a bid to be along for the show. TEA WITH LEMON trailed the field to the turn then made a rail bid in mid turn and kept on to
improve position. SOVIET STANDARD rushed up to be off the pace from three wide but flattened out on the turn and retreated. NEW DICE raced near the
back from three or four wide but was never a threat. U S HONOUR NAP was hustled along four wide to be forwardly placed to mid turn then gave way.

Footnotes
BLURT went to the lead to set all the pace, was challenged down the stretch but fended off the late closers and just lasted. CARTE BLANCHE was allowed
to settled down the backstretch then made a three wide bid into the final turn and tried to run down the leader and just missed. ROCKET HOTSHOT raced
near the back around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch from three wide and made a late rally in the stretch but was too late.
FLYING SAMURAI hustled along three wide to be off the pace to the top of the stretch but lacked the late response. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE roused along
the rail to track the leaders, never made a bid and weakened in the stretch. WICKED SUPRISE saved ground through the final turn then angled out to no
avail. SON OF GRACE trailed the field and was outrun.

CORTESE raced in the middle of the pack to mid turn then started to move up and went between horses near the top of the stretch and drove past the
leaders for the win. SHACKLEFORD STRONG pressed the pace from two wide to the top of the stretch then was forced five wide in the stretch, rebid but
couldn't catch the winner and proved second best. RICHIESONAROLL was forwardly placed in the three path then forced out to six wide into the upper
stretch and made a late run to be up for the show. FAITHFUL RULER sprinted to the clear lead through the turn then floated out going into the stretch and
continued to drift out in the stretch drive but held on for the show. GO EMI stalked the pace on the inside then moved out to two wide in upper stretch but
had no late kick. HUEY ATTACK raced near the back on the backstretch then saved ground around the turn and made a bid by cutting the corner into the
stretch but was empty. BAYOU BENNY showed little.

Footnotes
PALACE MAGIC raced near the back to the turn then moved up from three wide, tipped out to six wide in the stretch and dug in for the late run to win the
nod. AUNT STELLA stalked the pace from the two path then moved between horses at the top of the stretch to draw clear but was drifting out and was
nipped at the wire. ESSENTIAL BELLA was void of early speed, then made a six wide late rally in the stretch but was not enough. MY LADY SLEW vied for
the early lead on the inside then fell back on the turn and made a rebid on the inside to improve position. COOKIN ROSES pressed the pace from the three
path to mid turn and was outfinished in the stretch. PLAY TWENTY went to the front to a pressured lead, edged away on the turn but tired in the drive.
AVASARALA rushed up the rail for the lead but was shuffled back and had to steady into the turn and remained back.
