MAXIM MOMENT advanced three wide on the turn, led at the quarter pole and edged off through the stretch driving. EMPIRE'S SCORE dropped back
early, was in tight at the top of the stretch, angled out and rallied. SHANGHAI SUPERFLY alternated for the advantage inside then came up empty in the
stretch. STAR WEAVER broke a step slowly and trailed early then rallied mildly. MONSTRODAMOUS settled close up, rallied wide on the turn then
flattened out. REFUND RIGLER flashed speed for half a mile and gave way. EXTREME FORCE showed brief speed outside then began fading on the turn.

kept to the task. KING SWANSBORO raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied for second. SCAMP
WALKER tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and rallied mildly on the rail in the lane. LESLIE CHOW was bumped at the start, settled off the
pace, off the rail, chased three wide on the far turn, lacked a bid and finished evenly. ZOPPI FISCHBEIN raced off the pace inside, moved up at the quarter
pole, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. MILAGROSO tracked the pacesetter, chased two wide on the far turn and tired. I'M NOT A BABY
was outrun. AYE was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
AMBITIOUSLY PLACED rated off the leaders, bid into the stretch, collared the leader then drew away in the final furlong. AMATERASU raced in closest
pursuit of the pacesetter, led on the final turn but proved no match for the winner. WESTERN DREAM settled off the pace inside, rallied briefly then flattened
out. LIKE A PRO trailed far behind then passed rivals without menacing. COLOR CRUSH broke a step slowly then was never in contention. MELODIA
dropped far behind early and lacked a response. COLLIN'S GREY LADY quickly moved clear for five furlongs then stopped.

stretch and was in hand the final strides. SIR PALACE PRINCE set the pace racing with a clear lead, dug in gamely in the stretch run and yielded late. MY

third. MYHEARTWILLGOON chased close up outside, made a mild bid and weakened. WHY STOP THERE chased inside and tired. JAKNAVA raced off
the pace and had no rally. FIRE ARMY raced off the pace and failed to respond.
