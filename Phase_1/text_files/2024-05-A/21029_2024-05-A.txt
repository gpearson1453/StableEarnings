SASSY LAD stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole, was clear by the furlong marker and drew out to prove best under
mild urging. TOUCHDOWN MONTAGE set the early pace moving over to the inside, then was headed leaving the turn and could not go with the winner
while staying on for the place award. SCREEN STAR chased the pace three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane and had no kick while racing
one paced, held show award. MYSTIC POINT chased the early pace and steadied slightly nearing the half mile marker, then dropped to the inside and
saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed bid. SANTO was settled early, four wide on the turn and had no rally. NICK THE CARDSHARK was settled
early, three wide on the turn but lacked a rally. FEDERAL CASE was reserved early and saved ground on the turn and had no threat. AGAINST THE ODDS
was reserved early, two wide on the turn and swung wide and never factored. The rider on number four MYSTIC POINT claimed foul against the number
one SCREEN STAR for interference around the half mile marker, after the STEWARDS reviewed the replays the OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED and the
race was made official as is.
