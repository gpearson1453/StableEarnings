Footnotes
SPEAKS FOR ITSELF broke very alertly, showed good speed under urging while outside of a foe then moved clear around the nine-sixteenths, was guided
around the turn in the two path under some extra left-rein pressure, responded well when asked nearing the quarter-pole, drew off under a strong hand ride
into the final furlong then was geared down while much the best. HOODOOLAND was bumped in the hindquarters while off a bit slow, raced in third position
under urging, went three then two wide around the turn, dropped to the rail under strong encouragement outside the quarter-pole and clearly earned the
place while no match for the winner. WORLD TRAVELER broke a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, saved ground for most of the turn, shifted three
wide near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response while best of the
rest. NO ONE'S LAUGHING broke and bumped the hindquarters of an opponent while off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, raced greenly towards the
rear, shifted from near the inside to three wide before the three-eighths then four wide later on the turn and failed to threaten. MADAME ROSE broke very
fast, showed speed on the inside of a rival then was taken back near the nine-sixteenths and switched out, chased in the three path through the turn and
faded.

Footnotes
SYNONYMOUS tracked the pace along the inside patiently handed until roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened
away, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, seized command nearing the sixteenth marker and edged away to the finish to prevail. MASABEEH
coaxed from the gate, tussled briefly with a pair before establishing sole command to show the way in hand along the inside, came under attendance from
LOVE UNLIMITED to the outside and patiently waited until let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared
nearing the sixteenth pole, ran on to safely secure the place honors. LOVE UNLIMITED forwardly placed from the start, attended the leader to the outside
from the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to preserve
the show honors. BELLESHAZZA got lightly pinched back when in tight between foes leaving the chute, tracked the pace just off the inside coming under
coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, swung three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. CANDLESTICK MAKER settled just off the inside at
the tail of the field, tipped three wide at the three-eighths placed to light coaxing, floated four wide near the midway point on the turn to circle ANCHOR
LADY and had that rival float out directly in front, clipped the back of that rival bobbling heavily while showing great athleticism by both horse and rider to
stay upright, conceded two to three lengths of ground due to that incident, swung three then two wide into upper stretch paused and was not persevered
with through to the finish. ANCHOR LADY three wide through the first turn, chased three wide just outside the top pair, came under coaxing three furlongs
from home, floated four wide near the five-sixteenths directly in front of CANDLESTICK MAKER and was clipped in behind, tipped five wide into upper
stretch and faltered while being eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
SASSY MELISSA was well spotted just off the pace, drafted behind horses in the two path around the turn, shifted three wide while asked at the
quarter-pole, made a bid between horses at the three-sixteenths then took a short lead, swapped back to her inside lead coming to the sixteenth-pole then
shook clear and proved best under strong urging. PALACE GOSSIP tracked the leading duo on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the winner until near the sixteenth-pole then was outfinished but held the
place. NO PAYNE bumped hard with a rival at the start, settled towards the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then shifted to the two path, swung six
wide into the stretch and improved position to get the show. FONTANAFREDDA settled under some urging, traveled around the turn in the two path, came
three wide into the stretch then angled further out, chased the top two in the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then lost the show. MASTEROF THE
TUNES settled on the inside of an opponent, was roused three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.
UNCLE'S GEM settled on the outside, was roused in the three path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. READY A. P. brushed with
a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail under urging while still inside that foe around the turn, dropped back into the
final furlong and tired. FLIP MY ID bumped hard with a foe at the start, contested the pace on the outside, was urged along in the two path on the turn,
dropped back nearing the furlong marker and capitulated. FROSTED BOURBON was unsettled in the stall then broke out and hit the gate, settled on the far
outside, was roused three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. OFALLTHEGINJOINTS settled towards the
back, moved in late on the backstretch, went two to three wide around the turn and was no factor. BIG TIME LADY was ridden along at the rear, raced
inside to the two path on the turn and showed little. PROPER GRAMMAR brushed with a rival at the start, settled nicely on the inside, dropped back along
the rail on the turn and faltered.

MAKE MISCHIEF contested the pace down the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, drew off under urging into the
final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. FLASHNDYNAMITE went to the front, contested the pace on the outside then in the three path
around the turn, lost touch with the winner outside the quarter-pole and proved no match while able to save a share of second. CAFE SOCIETY came out at
the start while off a bit slow then was corrected by the rider, settled on the outside, moved in around the three-quarter pole then advanced closer to the
leaders, was roused in the two path coming to the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while able to get a share of the place. DEFAULT
PROTECTION leaned in at the start and was off a step slow, moved out early then tracked the pace on the outside, was roused in the four path on the turn
and came up empty.

turn before tipping to the three path down the backstretch, tucked back inside through the far turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered
three wide into upper stretch and improved position passing tired rivals. WORTH A SHOT broke out at the start bumping KURAMATA, showed the way in
hand just off the inside until tucked inside three furlongs from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch,
yielded the front straightened away and weakened. HIGHLAND CHIEF (IRE) got pinched back at the start, then was in tight briefly leaving the chute and

Footnotes
ACT OF CONGRESS showed good speed and quickly sped clear, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when asked for her best
in upper stretch and drew off under steady urging. CROSSTALK came outward at the break, chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around
the turn and held the place while no match for the winner. ROYAL DANCER bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, raced off the pace under
urging, saved ground around the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved to just get the show. SUCCULENT bumped with a foe at the start and
was off a step slow, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and also improved position but just missed the show. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY
settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out inside the furlong marker and failed to rally.
MERGER OF EQUALS was urged along in the front half of the field, saved ground on the turn and weakened. VALENTIA ISLAND bumped with an
opponent at the start, raced at the rear, went around the turn in the three path, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. BELARUS settled off
the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, was in a bit tight late and lacked the needed response. OAK LOVES A FIGHT
bumped with a rival at the start, rounded the turn in the three path and was no factor. DARN THAT SONG smashed through the front of the gate prior to the
start then was brought back around and reloaded, had her head-turned at the start and was off a bit slow, moved up under urging, went three wide on the
turn and tired. VALLELUJAH was urged along off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. THAT'S
WHY I'M ME shied outward just after the start, settled on the outside, went four wide around the turn and failed to respond.
