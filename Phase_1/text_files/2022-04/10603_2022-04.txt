Footnotes
RHEAUME steadied among rivals exiting the dog-leg, settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide and between horses passing the three furlong
pole, launched a rally inside of foes in upper stretch, tipped outside of the clear leader at the furlong grounds to take aim while resenting being shown the
crop by flagging her tail, and sustained her charge to drive past that foe in the late stages. OUT OF SIGHT set the pace, established a loose advantage
down the backstretch, inched further away into the turn, but began to tire in midstretch, and was caught in the final sixteenth. EAU CLAIRE tracked from
midpack, chased three wide around the turn, and stayed on for a minor share. OUR JESSICA raced far back, was urged along four wide and outside of foes
around the turn, and moved up in the lane. SARATOGA CHROME broke through the starting gate pre-race, then chased the leader from the outside, but
weakened between horses in the lane. I'LL GO ALL IN chased along the inside, but faded turning for home. ALTARE was done early.

Footnotes
TO A T trailed early on, rated four wide around the turn, circled rivals five wide entering the lane with a quick blitz, led approaching the furlong grounds, and
edged clear thereafter. CHLOE ROSE stalked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the leading trio approaching the lane, found room and split
rivals three wide in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer oncharging rival in the process, and chased that foe home. STENCIL prompted the pace
two wide and between horses, led passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by outer rivals approaching the furlong grounds, and yielded. BELLA
PRINCIPESSA hopped at the start, tracked two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival straightening into the lane, and
kept on in hopes of a minor share. RED PEPPER GRILL stalked three wide, pressed around the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but weakened between
horses in upper stretch. HEY MAMA set the pace inside of a pair of pressing rivals, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

NO SALT tracked the pace, surpassed tiring inner foes while in the five path into the turn to take aim on the clear leader, ranged up to that foe while tucking
to the three path passing the three furlong pole, forged an advantage entering the lane, and drew off. JUST RIGHT laid off of the pace two wide, improved
between horses into the turn, chased the top two entering the lane, then grinded away mildly inside of VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD to reach that foe on the wire
for place. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD vied three wide, drew clear with five furlongs remaining, met NO SALT's bid passing the three furlong pole, got headed
by that foe entering the lane, gave way, and got nailed by an inner rival for place. BINGO JOHN saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
THERISASTORMBREWIN was held at the start and failed to factor. DADDY KNOWS vied between horses early on, but was done into the turn. INVEST
vied for the lead inside of pair of rivals, but was through after a half mile. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START,
THERISASTORMBREWIN WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER.

Footnotes
BOOM BOOM KABOOM laid right behind the leading pair while just a bit off of the rail, easily split those rivals in upper stretch to produce a bid at the furlong
grounds, and drove clear. KID BOURBON settled at the rear two to three wide into the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and rallied to reach
place in the closing stages. FOMO set the pace inside of a prompting foe around the turn, shook free of that rival straightening into the lane, but was bested
by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded, and lost place approaching the wire. MATTY'S MARAUDER rated at the rear along the inside, awaited
racing room in the two path turning for home, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly. KARNAK failed to factor. MIDASWELLRUN
tracked two wide, but failed to keep pace despite rider encouragement around the turn, and made little impact. MACH ONE stalked along the inside, shifted
outside of the leading trio approaching the quarter pole, but lacked a kick to produce a bid in upper stretch, and weakened between rivals. MARATHONER
pressed the leader from the outside while a path away from that rival, but failed to keep pace passing the three sixteenths pole while hanging on his left
lead, and weakened between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
CITIZEN K sat reserved while at the rear of the group in the two to three path around the turn, fanned to the seven path turning for home, brushed with an
inner rival straightening into the lane, produced a good kick in upper stretch, rallied along with an inner SCERZANDO to bid in the final sixteenth, and
prevailed. SCHERZANDO tracked from midpack two wide, split rivals while brushing with those foes in the four path entering the lane, rallied along with an
outer CITIZEN K to produce a bid for the lead in the final sixteenth, but got outfinished. HEYMACKIT'SJACK set the pace inside of a prompting rival, shook
clear of that foe approaching the furlong grounds, but was reeled in by a pair of outer rivals in the final sixteenth. YARROW settled off of the pace two wide,
swung to the six path turning for home, but was unable to split foes and checked in tight quarters entering the lane, then shifted inwardly, and moved up
between horses in the final furlong. BUILT TO LAST took the turn three wide while in midpack, shifted to the five path before brushing with an inner rival
entering the lane, then was outkicked by rivals on either side in upper stretch, and kept on. BUCKORTWO prompted the pace two wide, chased the pace
setter through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, changed over approaching the furlong grounds, but yielded at that junction. CENTRAL PRIDE
failed to sustain forward early position down the backstretch, saved ground towards the back of the pack around the turn, then failed to menace between
horses through the lane. SAFALOW'S MISSION stalked along the inside, but tired. DANCING WITH RICO stalked the leading pair from the three path, but
weakened between horses in midstretch. BISERNO showed little.

Footnotes
RAFFINITY vied between horses early on, then only inside of BOSS CARA into the turn, sustained the long duel with that rival while hanging on her left lead
through the lane, and edged away late. BOSS CARA vied for the lead three to two wide into the turn, dueled turning for home, sustained the battle while
hanging on her left lead through the lane, but was turned away in the closing stages. PREDETERMINED sat back when the gates opened and broke a step
slowly, laid at the rear along the inside, produced a rail rally through the turn, claimed show at the furlong grounds, and chased the dueling leaders home
while narrowing their margin. HANDLE THE TRUTH settled at the rear, was allowed to lag well behind the field passing the three furlong marker, shifted out
entering the lane, and was rolling in the final furlong to reach a minor placing. BELLA DOMENICA tracked three wide, moved forward to stalk the top pair
around the turn, but only managed to chase them through upper stretch before fading. SABREEN laid off of the pace inside of rivals while a bit off of the rail,
got outmoved by an inner rival turning for home before shifting to the four path, and failed to menace through the lane. LOVE THAT FACE raced close up
inside of the leading pair early on, but chased them around the turn, and tired in the stretch. THE HONORABLE RUTH tracked in midpack two wide and
between horses, but checked behind a tiring MAJESTIC SPIRIT at the half mile pole, took the turn in the four to five path, and made little impact. MAJESTIC
SPIRIT was forwardly placed down the backstretch, but folded around the turn.

Footnotes
REPO ROCKS stumbled inconsequently at the start, recovered to prompt the pace two wide into the turn, vied around the bend, led at the quarter pole,
assumed command in upper stretch, and drew off. PRINCE JAMES stalked along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, and moved up
between horses. SPUN AND WON stalked three wide, came into the lane in the five path, but lacked a kick between horses, and saved show.
FITZPATRICK laid off of the pace along the inside, gradually shifted out to the six path turning for home, and stayed on midly. COMPETITIVE SAINT was
outrun. MORE GRAYTFUL set the pace, led inside of the eventual winner around the turn, but was headed and proved no match at the quarter pole, and
stopped.

Footnotes
ITS ALL RELEVANT set the pace well in hand while feeling mild outside pressure from an outer rival around the turn, responded readily when set down in
upper stretch, edged away, and held sway through the final furlong. EASY TO BLESS stalked two wide, but only managed to chase the leader through the
lane while proving second best. RYAN'S CAT rated at the rear along the inside, picked up stride while shifting four wide approaching midstretch, and stayed
on to claim a minor share. DOUBLY BLESSED tracked three wide around the turn, bid for place entering the lane, but tired. SUPREME AURA took the turn
in the three path while at the rear, swung to the six path entering the lane, and made little impact. STRIKING SPEED broke a beat slowly, recovered to track
along the inside, but faded. DARK MONEY tracked in midpack two wide, but faded through the lane. BABY I'M PERFECT raced close up along the inside,
but sustained an injury at the five furlong pole, was pulled up into the turn, and vanned off.

Footnotes
CELINE THE QUEEN prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led at the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, and lasted from an outer rival
in the late stages. GRACEFULLY WILD tracked in the two path, shifted three wide entering the lane, rallied to claim place at the furlong grounds, and was
gaining on the clear leader while on her left lead through the late stages, but ran out of ground. MO DAMORNINGGROUCH laid in midpack in the two path
behind the main group around the turn, split rivals three wide at the furlong grounds, and stayed on while hanging on her left lead. DRAW OFF stalked along
the inside, then chased the clear leader from between horses before tiring. SHESADANCINGQUEEN broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace before
swinging six wide entering the lane, but lacked the needed punch. CHIARA tracked in the four path, came into the lane five wide, but lacked a bid and
flattened out. WINTER SIREN stalked three wide, but weakened between horsres entering the lane. WHITE HOT was sent to set the pace, vied inside of
the eventual winner around the turn, but was headed at the quarter pole and weakened. WABAUNSEE broke slowly and made little impact.
LADYSHANGHITREVOR never got involved. DINI'S DESTINY was outrun. BACKED BY GOLD acted up in the gate pre-race, and was outrun.
