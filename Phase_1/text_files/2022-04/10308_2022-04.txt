on the turn, took the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, shook clear while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, responded well while remaining on his
inside lead in the final furlong and held sway under strong urging. LUCKY BRODY settled at the rear of the field on the outside, was roused three wide at
the three-eighths, swung five wide into the stretch, gained on the outside under a drive into the final furlong and finished willingly to get the place. RUSH TO
HONOR broke a bit slow, moved up to the inside of the early leader then was taken under a snug hold and rated just off the pace, was let out late on the
backstretch, chased inside on the turn, was driven four wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner under a right-handed crop into the final furlong then
switched to a left-handed crop, lugged in some outside the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked while able to get the show. JOHNSELECTRICRIDE was
coaxed from the gate, set the pace with some company while off the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, vied inside of two foes in the two
path on the turn, lost the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. CONNECTED broke out then bumped with a rival,
prompted the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader approaching the half-mile pole, was asked in the three path while between foes on the turn,
dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened. CAGNEY settled under some urging, raced between foes in the two path early on the turn,
dropped back at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
LINNY KATE bumped at the start by SUDDEN IMPULSE, who broke inwards, raced just off the inside early on before tipping three wide near the half mile
pole as the leader drifted outwards, went four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced to latch on the leader nearing
the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling from near the eighth pole to the finish getting bumped just inside the eighth
pole as her main rival came outwards under a left handed stick, took narrow command just inside the sixteenth marker and dug in to prevail at the end.
SUDDEN IMPULSE broke in at the start bumping .LINNY KATE, established the front shortly after and showed the way in hand just off the inside, drifted

spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and came out under a left handed stick slightly to bump her main foe just inside the eighth pole, got
collared just inside the sixteenth pole and fought on to the finish well clear of the rest for the place honors. APRIL ANTICS hustled from the gate, chased

Footnotes
PATIENT CAPITAL brushed the near side stall at the start forcing the rider from the left side iron, the rider losing his balance and precariously leaning on
SMOKE AND HEAT and losing the right iron as a result, got a helpful boost from the rider of SMOKE AND HEAT and up-righted himself regaining the irons
with a few strides to settle three wide just off the top pair, tipped four to five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered five
wide into upper stretch and advanced to take command at the three-sixteenths, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in to the finish holding safe and clear to
prevail. SMOKE AND HEAT got bumped at the start by ACTUALIZE, who broke outwards, and was leaned on by the aforementioned foe's rider, offered that
jock a helping hand, then got clipped behind by SUKOON, chased briefly just off the inside before tipping four to five wide, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to close in in the late stages and secure the place honors. SUKOON got
bumped and pinched between foes at the start due to pressure from ACTUALIZE, then clipped SMOKE AND HEAT in behind and bobbled conceding an
additional four lengths before settling back into stride, raced six paths off the inside early on before tucking to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. DADS GOOD RUNNER hustled from
the gate, showed the way in hand two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home under threat, yielded the front with
three-sixteenths remaining and weakened to the finish. ACTUALIZE broke out at the start pinching back SUKOON and bumping SMOKE AND HEAT into
PATIENT CAPITAL, chased just off the inside in aim of the leader before tipping three then four wide from the half mile pole and advancing to apply
pressure on the front under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

SWEET SURPRISE showed early speed then was taken in hand, stalked the pace on the outside of the leading duo, turned up the pressure in the three
path early on the turn, took the advantage outside the five-sixteenths, was asked for her best into upper stretch, drifted out into the final furlong and proved
best under strong urging. WATERS OF MEROM was bumped hard at the start and forced solidly into another foe, moved up under urging to contest the
pace on the inside of foes, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the five-sixteenths, fought on with that foe into upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. TWEAQUED broke out then bumped lightly with a foe, settled on the
outside, made a bid in the four path on the turn, drifted out under a drive in upper stretch then was straightened by the rider, drifted out again between the
furlong marker and the sixteenth-pole then weakened but was clear for the show. KINGDOM QUEEN bumped lightly with a rival at the start then dropped
back, settled at the rear under some urging, tacked onto the back of the field with five furlongs to run, chased five wide around the turn and tired. SCENIC
VIEW was bumped solidly at the start, showed speed then was well placed just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, dropped back
three wide into the stretch and faltered. INTELLIGENCEREPORT broke in and bumped hard with a foe, showed speed then disputed the pace, was urged
along passing the five-eighths, dropped back with a half-mile to run and retreated.

BRUNATE tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the two to three path on the turn, chased the runner-up into upper stretch then made a bid,
took the lead into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. TAMBURRO'S SOX was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear
advantage, raced inside to the two path around the turn, was asked turning into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong, lost the advantage to
the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. MATTY'S MARAUDER was hustled from the start then urged along off the
pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. ACTUARY (GB)
chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while moving from the inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. BLAME IT ON BRUTUS dropped back while urged along, went four wide while inside of RUN CASPER RUN on the turn then came
five wide into the stretch, continued inside that foe in the drive and failed to rally. RUN CASPER RUN was off slow and spotted the front several lengths,
raced at the rear while ridden along, went five wide on the turn then came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MASKED MARAUDER four wide in pursuit from mid pack, advanced through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths to take command just before
spinning three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and gamely fended off the challenge to prevail
by a nostril on the wire. KEY POINT broke in brushing the near side stall and came under hustling, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong getting on near even terms inside the sixteenth marker
but was ultimately denied at the end. KID D'ORO got away to a stutter step start and came under coaxing, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tipped out two paths straightened away, then offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors. BOLD
JOURNEY broke in at the start bumping FORTY COMETS, raced five wide in close aim of the front before tucking three wide through the turn, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. TACO BEAN away well, prompted the leader from the outside four to
five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch in retreat and weakened in the drive. A LONGLONGTIMEAGO chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE coaxed from the start, showed the way along the inside under pressure from a pair,
came under coaxing from the three-eighths, got displaced from the front and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish. FORTY
COMETS got bumped at the start by BOLD JOURNEY, who broke inwards, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn, went five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. IT'S GRAVY hustled from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths and
tired.
