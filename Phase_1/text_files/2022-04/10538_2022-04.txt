BAAGY vied for the early lead towards the inside, made a bid to draw clear on the turn while in the two path, then drew off in the stretch to prove best under
left handed crop urging. KAZTHAROS vied for the early lead three wide, then tracked the winner three wide on the turn, proved to be no match for that rival
while being second best. ROBBY'S RANSOM chased the pace on the inside and weakened, held show award. T C GREELEY chased the pace four to five
wide and came up empty in the drive, missed show award. ROCKIN THE PALACE was reserved early and saved ground on the turn, swung out five wide
for the drive and had no rally. VICTORS VALIANT chased the early pace in between horses, then drifted out to be five wide by the quarter pole and
weakened.

JACK BE NIMBLE was rated along on the inside to the quarter pole, then shifted out and came four wide into the lane, closed well on the outside and drew
clear in the final sixteenth to prove best. FREEAINTFREE was sent to the front to set the pace while clear, then was collared around the sixteenth pole and
had nothing left while saving the place award. MR DUBAI was reserved early, came three wide into the lane and had a good late rally. NOT TO BLAME
tracked the early pace and made a three to four wide bid but flattened out. NOTORIOUS REY was rated three wide early, then was on the inside by the
quarter pole and lacked the needed stretch bid. VENCIL failed to menace while saving ground.

Footnotes
SUNSHINE MAX was off slowly, then chased the pace on the inside, eased out nearing the quarter pole and came four wide into the drive, closed well to
wear down rivals to get up late under a drive. HELMS DEEP dueled for the early lead on the inside, then fell back at the quarter pole, shifted and came
three wide into the drive and came again to just miss. COOS BAY dueled for the early lead three wide, made a two wide bid to take command and cross
over to the inside by the quarter pole and was still clear by the furlong marker but it proved to be not enough as was caught late. MY MAGICAL MAN was
reserved early, came three wide into the lane and had a late rally. GOTANDA was off a step slow, settled on the inside, then had a belated rally on the
inside. GEM JUAN was settled back early, came wide into the drive but had no significant gain. DREAMING OF LOVE chased the pace three wide and
swung out five wide for the drive but came up empty.

FAIRY DREAMS was rated early and dropped down to the rail by the half mile marker, then shifted out and made a four wide move on the turn, drew clear
in the furlong grounds to prove best under mild urging. SCARLET LILY tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid to gain a short advantage by the
furlong marker, but proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. LA LENA set the pace while clear and was headed by the furlong marker
and faded. MEEMOO was rated along three wide and made a three to four wide bid on the turn but was empty late. VALENTINA'S CUPID passed the tiring
rivals. FUELED UP chased the pace on the inside and weakened. PEACEMON showed brief speed and stopped.

Footnotes
BOCK prompted the early pace three wide, made a bid on the turn to draw clear, then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best, driving. ELUSIVE
JESTER was well rated early, made a three wide bid on the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. HONOR COLLECTION
chased the pace three to four wide and weakened, held show award. SUPER HOUDINI passed the tiring rivals. LEAVE 'EM LOADED set the pace from the
inside and gave way. BOSSY CAT tired.
