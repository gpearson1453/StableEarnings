HIGHEST PRAISE stalked the pace while four then three wide through the turn, bid into the lane and edged away through the final sixteenth. SHIPSHAPE
vied for the early lead while off the inside, gained a short lead into the turn, was no match for the winner through the lane but gamely held the place spot.
JENNSTONE chased the pace from the two path through the turn, vied into the lane then missed the place spot. CONCRETE CHARLIE angled four four in
late turn and into the lane then finished evenly. HART WELL was never a serious threat while near the rail throughout. HICKORY HIGH forced the early
pace then steadily faded.

clear late. AMICABLE was unhurried early while off the inside, angled into the six or seven path into the lane and finished with good energy to be second
best. COMPLEX JUSTICE vied for the lead while in the three or two path through the turn, continued in contention into the lane then gave in late.
UNBRIDLED VICTOR raced along the inside and lacked a bid. KINGOFTHERAINBOW bumped at the start, raced in mid-pack from between rivals, was still
in contention into the lane then had no bid. FASHION NUGGET raced in the two path through the turn and never was a factor. GOOD SUGAR chased the
pace from the four path through the turn and was empty. JEFF THE RUNNER was done after a half while saving ground.

GEORGE THE MAN set the pace from the outset, shook clear after straightening in the lane then stayed. MAKER'S PLEASE was along the inside early,
came off the rail in mid-turn, continued in the three path into the lane and was inching up to the wire and just lasted for the place spot. BELLA'S PRAYER
was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and rallied. ONE WAY RAY was along the inside into the lane, had aim on the
leaders with a furlong to go then weakened. MEMORY IN MOTION was in the two path through the turn and offered a mild gain. NO PROOF chased the
pace from the three or four path then weakened. SMILE LIKE KYLE chased the winner into late turn, bid into the lane then faded. VENYATTA was never a
factor while in the two path. MONEY MAN BRYLAN was done after half while near the rail. REAL RIOT trailed throughout while in the three path.

Footnotes
COMPASS POINT raced between rivals through the turn and into the lane, moved to a serious position outside the eighth pole then edged up inside the
sixteenth pole. MALIBU CLASSIC vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane, had a short lead just outside the eighth pole then finished
gamely while yielded to the winner. OVERJOY raced in the two or three path through the turn, angled into the seven path for the drive and found her best
stride late. MACHO ALEGRE saved ground through the turn and needed more inside the eighth pole. ORO AZTECA vied three wide through the turn, led
after straightening in the lane then gave way. MANUELITO was in the four to the six path through the path and into the lane and found energy too late.
FLYING SAMURAI was along the inside through the turn and never was a threat. PRINCE ACT raced in the four to the three path through the turn and tired.
MISCHIEVIOUSBUD was in a bit tight at the start, raced near the inside and never factored. INDIGO RICH was never a factor from the three path. BINGE
was four wide through the turn, continued a serious contender after straightening then was empty. REMEMBER HYMN vied for the lead into the lane then
was done.

PICKLE FEET gained the lead soon after the start, raced on a clear lead into the lane, repulsed a bid near the eighth pole and drew away. TOO BAD
JUSTICE stalked the winner from the four path into the lane, bid outside the eighth pole and could not stay with the top one while settling for second best.
JERICHO EXPRESS chased top two from the three path through the turn then lacked a closing response while best of the rest. WISHY WASHY was near
the two path into the lane, came off the rail a bid for the drive and moved up while not a threat. SPACE FORCE WON was in the four path through the turn,
came into the lane from the six path, moved in a couple of paths then drifted about late while racing greenly. COPPER HARBOR saved ground while along
the rail and tired. SHINEONBRAD two to three path through the turn and tired. T. G. PRADO was never a menace while in the two path through the turn.
WILD MAN CADEM was outrun while in the four to five path through the turn. KORDELL was outrun along the inside.

steadied early while in tight between rivals, raced in the four or five path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and moved up. BAJAN
RUM vied for the lead two wide early, was passed in late turn then faded late. IDEA MAN was never a factor while in the two path. ROUGHIN THE CITY
