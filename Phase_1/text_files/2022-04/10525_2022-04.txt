PEACEARELLA showed the way while saving ground around the first turn, continued to lead the field up the backstretch, opened up while racing in the two
path around the far turn and in upper stretch, and held a short margin to the wire while drifting out in the final furlong. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL pressed the
pace from the two path around the first turn, dropped back to chase the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path
and gained ground in late stretch. LIFE IS ETERNAL saved ground around the first turn, stalked the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, began a
bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly. V W TURBO raced in the three path around the
first turn, chased the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and faded from there. AWESOME TAP
hopped up and steadied leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack up the backstretch, came
around the far turn in the two path and was empty in the stretch. SIMPLE JUSTICE raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn, trailed on the

Footnotes
CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST lugged out and bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle from the
two path around the turn, pulled clear with a furlong to go and held off the late closers to save the win. CARDI G dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung out entering the stretch, bumping with TIMELY TRADITION in the process, took another run at the
eventual winner and gained ground to the wire, but missed. TIMELY TRADITION bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase
the leaders between horses up the backstretch, was bumped and forced to check near the quarter pole when CARDI G came into her lane, and gained
ground on the outside from there. TANYA'S GEM chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path racing around the
turn, bumped with TIMELY TRADITION entering the stretch, recovered and gained ground on the outside down the lane. ALLURE FORTUNE chased the
frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, made a mild improvement from the rail in upper stretch and flattened out from
there. THE RIDER OF CARDI G CLAIMED FOUL ON THE RIDER OF CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST, CITING INTERFERENCE COMING OFF THE TURN.
UPON REVIEW, THIS CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED. BOTH THE RIDER OF TIMELY TRADITION AND TANYA'S GEM CLAIMED FOUL ON THE RIDER OF
CARDI G, CITING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CARDI G AND PLACED HER
4TH.

NIMITZ CLASS pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path passing the three eighths pole, took over entering the
stretch and was clear to the wire. MACHO SMOKE tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, launched a bid from the three path coming around
the turn, could not stay with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. LONG TOM trailed the field in the early going, began
to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn and continued to gain ground on the outside down the lane. ECLIPTICALS ELLIOT
bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, stalked the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was
outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. DREAMERS REWARD bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders
between horses up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and faded from there. GANDI hit the gate leaving it, recovered to lead the field
on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. PAGE DOWN raced at the back of the pack
from the get go, saved ground around the turn and never fired.

Footnotes
MIA ANGELINA saved ground around the first turn, pressed the pace up the backstretch, took over the lead headed into the far turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and held her margin to the wire. ALLISON K raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack,
saved ground around the far turn and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch. GIZMO'S DESTINY raced in the three and four path around the
first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and chased the winner home, getting
caught for the place. NEARLY MISSED saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from
the two path and finished evenly between horses. INTROSPECTION raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle
of the pack, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty from there. MAGALIE saved ground around the first turn, led the way between horses
up the backstretch, gave way coming into the second turn and continued to tire from there. WICKED T trailed the field the entire way around the oval and
was never a factor.
