Footnotes
SWAGGY GEORGE was sent up the inside to set the pace, then came off the rail leaving the turn and was headed leaving the three sixteenths by
FIRSTCADENTE, came in and bumped that rival twice through the lane, prevailed late to prove best under a drive. FIRSTCADETE was well rated early,
made a inside bid leaving the turn to go on even terms for command with the pacesetter, then was bumped a couple of times through the furlong grounds,
hit the rail and was outfinished late to just miss. RILEYS DUDE stalked the pace three wide and came into the drive three wide but had no kick while
needing more. SEAZAN was settled early while four wide on the turn, came six wide into the drive and had a belated rally. URBAN WARRIOR tracked the
pace four wide and weakened in the drive. BLAKENSTEIN was rated along early, then was three to four wide on the turn and came up empty in the drive.
CUZ was settled early on the inside and lacked a rally. The STEWARDS posted an INQUIRY and the jockey on FIRSTCADETE claimed foul against
SWAGGY GEORGE for interference in the stretch, after reviewing the video replays the STEWARDS disqualified SWAGGY GEORGE from first and placed
him second.

Footnotes
EL FANTASMA stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and took over leaving the turn, drew off in the drive to prove much the
best under a drive. ZIPPER ZAPPER dueled for the early lead three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn and proved to be no match for the winner,
saved place award. POSEIDONS MYTH was settled early towards the inside, advanced on the turn two wide, angled out in the drive and finished willingly to
just miss the place award. GIOVANE'S PROMISE chased the early pace from between rivals, then shifted to the outside to be four wide by the quarter pole,
came five wide into the drive and had no kick. RIO HATO chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. BUSTER BURNS was settled three to four
wide and had no rally. BUSTER was not a factor. KAPHAVATA dueled for the early lead on the inside, then fell off the pace by the quarter pole and swung
out four wide for the druive, then stopped and was eased late, walked off.

Footnotes
STARSHIP BELMONT vied for the early lead on the inside, made a bid to shake clear on the turn and then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove
best under a drive. NEW WAYS TO DREAM was well placed while three to two wide, made a mild bid four wide by the quarter pole, then finished willingly
but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. BEASTIE GIRL was reserved early on the inside, advanced on the turn and came four wide into
the drive and had a belated rally for the show award. ANY PORT vied for the early lead three wide and weakened. REAL GOOD VYBZ was settled early,
came four wide into the drive and had no rally. DIALING VALENTINE chased the pace on the inside and weakened. LULI'S DANCER was settled early on
the inside and lacked a rally. LOVINGTIZ was outrun early and raced four wide on the backstretch and was never a factor. WINDY REIGN was through after
a half mile.

Footnotes
IT'S FATE was well rated throughout, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then continued that bid on the outside and slowly edged clear late to prove
best under a drive. CHILL HAZE was sent to the lead to set the pace while racing off the rail, then shook clear leaving the turn and drifting out, but was
caught in deep stretch, game effort. BOURBON WISDOM stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out late.
CHINOMADITO was settled three to four wide and had no rally. FUN PADDY was settled three wide and lacked a rally. WHISTLE ME HOME settled on the
inside and weakened. SHAKEM N BREAKEM failed to menace.

AFRICAN HERITAGE was well rated early on the inside, made a three wide bid to take over leaving the turn, then remained clear to prove best under a
drive. ALABAMA SLAMMER set the early pace from the inside, then was headed leaving the turn, kept on gamely to the wire but was out kicked by the
winner. MUNQAD was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the drive, needed more in the drive while
getting the nod for the show award. AZIZA was well placed along the inside but lacked the needed stretch bid, just missed show award. ST. JOE LOUIS
(GB) was checked into the first turn, then was reserved on the backstretch, came five wide into the drive and offered a belated rally. RECORDER was rated
along early, then was on the inside on the turn and had no rally. GATE CREW was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had no rally. SILENCE
failed to menace. THATZA ALPHA was not a factor. VIVA VICTORY showed little.
