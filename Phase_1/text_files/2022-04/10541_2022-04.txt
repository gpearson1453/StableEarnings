Footnotes
BARBARA'S CHAMP got away well, was content to track inside, moved closer to challenge while coming off the fence leaving the turn, edged clear in the
stretch under steady handling. REEL EM IN stalked early then advanced three wide on the turn commencing a bid, was no match for the winner but second
best. MAJORWAYHOME tracked inside, saved ground on the turn, improved in the stretch. LAUGHING STORM settled at the rear racing near the inside,
came out about the sixteenth pole and improved position. SEVEN ROONEY raced last but one early, went about three wide on the turn, came out five deep
in upper stretch and ran on evenly lacking the needed late kick. REAL POUCH stalked from outside going three to four wide on the turn, lugged in several
paths about the sixteenth pole and faded. BLACK EYED BANDIT set the early tempo racing off the rail, went two to three wide on the turn, weakened then
checked near the sixteenth pole as a rival came in. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
DANZ AT COLFAX was urged forward after the break, set the pace on or just off the rail, came out a bit turning for home while in command and clear, held
safe over MCMERCELUS, who stalked the aforementioned, moved out from three to five wide leaving the turn, closed the gap but was too late.
EVANGELINA WHO broke outwardly brushing a rival, stalked off the leaders, was carried out further while tipping out from three to six wide on the turn, kept
on in the lane. WHO'S ON THE RUN angled in heading into the turn, raced three wide through most of that bend advancing on the leaders, came out a bit
turning for home then shifted in once in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. PROBATE settled well back of the leaders, went four wide on the turn
moving out a bit later on that bend before altering back inside rivals, came out in late stretch for room and ran on mildly. DIABOLICAL PACKAGE chased
the leaders mid-pack three wide into the turn, angled out seven deep leaving that bend, flattened out in the stretch. GUY IN THE SKY was lightly brushed at
the start, chased outside, was carried eight deep into the stretch and had no rally. GOLDEN CARACAL failed to threaten after racing on then just off the rail.
MR. MCFEELY chased briefly, steadily retreated along the inside. LA CHEVA was mid-pack early, dropped back five wide on the turn and faded.

SWITCHERONIMO settled mid-pack off the leaders shifting in two wide entering the first turn, edged closer heading to the far turn, bid three wide on that
bend, took command outside the eighth pole and drew clear. JUST AWESOME M was caught three wide into the first turn, stalked the leaders going three
to four wide on the far turn, was no match for the winner but secured the place. GALLOPING UNO dueled outside a rival, bested that one but lacked the
needed late kick. FLYING WARRIOR dueled inside, weakened. AGRONOMO shifted in from four to three wide on the first turn racing mid-pack, lost position
a bit heading to the far turn while moving in a bit nearer the inside, went two to three deep on that bend, improved position turning for home but evened out.
GATLING GOLD switched outside a rival early, went three wide on the first turn racing well back, moved out further to pass rivals five wide late on the far
turn but was never near enough to threaten. CEBOLLA saved ground on both turns to no avail. JEWEL OF NAVARONE chased outside four wide, dropped
back and faded. FORT STANTON SCOUT bobbled slightly at the break, was in a bit tight three wide heading to the first turn, made a mild advance outside
five wide heading to the far turn then faltered and faded.

between runners early, lost ground two wide on the turn then switched outside foes three deep later on that bend, kept on for the place. BODIE'S LOVE

turn and had no extra for the drive. YATAHEY raced off the leaders near the inside, came out in upper stretch and ran on evenly. CYNICAL GIRL failed to
threaten after going three to four wide on the turn. DESERT BEAUTY chased the pace along the inside, weakened.

leader to take a narrow advantage just after the opening quarter, was clear leaving the far turn having gone two wide on that bend but was outfinished.
ATTILIANNO settled toward the back, came out five wide turning for home, gained steadily but needed more. TWO STEP JACK tracked the leading pair
inside a rival, went two wide on the turn and was within range turning for home but weakened thereafter. HENRY ON THE RUN raced outside at the tail
end, went four wide on the turn, failed to menace. BRIGHT WAY was urged clear early, overtaken after the opening quarter, vied briefly inside then gave
way.

Footnotes
MINE THAT STAR switched outside a foe to go two wide into the first turn racing mid-pack, moved out four wide late on the far turn, found room between
rivals at the top of the stretch, bid inside the leader in late stretch and just got up. GODDARD moved in from four to three wide stalking off the leading pair
through the first turn, took closer order heading to the far turn moving out four to five wide commencing a bid, had a narrow lead turning for home but was
outfinished. LIMONITE shifted in heading to the first turn saving ground on that bend, switched out up the backstretch, advanced while moving out from
three to five wide on the far turn, gained late but needed more. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO stalked three wide, made a mild bid late on the far turn but could not
sustain the effort. SKY JUMPER settled toward the rear three to four wide early, fanned from four to six wide on the far turn and ran on mildly. MR
PAYTIENCE dueled outside a rival two wide, weakened. MAGIC MOSCO was a bit fractious in the gate then in tight three wide early on the first turn, failed
to menace. CONVENTION switched off the inside two to three wide early, swung six wide leaving the far turn and was not a factor. COMPETITIVE IDEA
dueled inside, gave way.

Footnotes
HEREDITARY stalked three to four wide, swept past to the lead just after the three-sixteenths and drew clear. GORKY PARK settled toward the rear two
wide, edged closer up the backstretch, moved out four wide coming to the three-sixteenths, secured the place but was no match for the winner. BRAZILIAN
SUMMER dueled outside two wide, weakened. LEATHERNECK stalked three wide, struck the lead about the five-sixteenths before being overtaken at the
three-sixteenths, offered no extra. PHOENIX FIRE was unhurried early racing off the fence in the three path, made an early advance between foes heading
to the far turn, tipped out five wide late on that bend then evened out for the drive. ALMOST A STORM dueled inside, gave way. BOOMER WHO saved
ground
through
the
first
turn, came out on the far turn to
be four wide by the three-sixteenths, was never near enough
to
threaten.
SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE raced four to five wide, dropped back and faded.
