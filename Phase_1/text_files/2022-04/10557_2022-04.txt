Footnotes
FERVENTS WAGON away well, quick strider assumed command early, steady urged, drifted out and quickly corrected late in a solid effort. AIR RAID came
out two paths at the start, then lugged out some more approaching the eighth pole, corrected with right hand urging and finished up a willing second. UP
FOR EVERYTHING came in two paths at the start, and steadily drifted out the second half of the race. SLAM A CORONA away cleanly, steady urged in a
even effort. DISRUPTOR floated in two paths at the start, hand urged throughout in a even effort. ONE FAMOUS COMMANDO away cleanly, asked left
handed and failed to respond. DON CARMELO broke out, in contention early, shied severely when rival shifted out, took up and coasted to the finish.
