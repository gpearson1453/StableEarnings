Footnotes
STARRY HOPE was fractious in the gate then hopped a bit at the start, bumped with MAP EM UP soon after, trailed in the two path for a half, circled five
wide around the far turn, swept to the front leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. EMMA AND I tracked the pace three wide, bid four wide between foes
turning for home, battled between foes in the stretch and was second best late. KISSING FROGS set the pace along the rail, was collared leaving the eighth
pole but fought on inside to hold third. BALL LIGHTNING lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turns and rallied belatedly. PERFECT KIMBERLY
S chased the pace two wide between foes, bid between rivals in midstretch, steadied near the sixteenth pole and faded. MOTHERWELL prompted the pace
two wide and tired in the lane. LUNAR BLAST chased the pace from the rail and came up empty in the lane. MAP EM UP hit the starting gate then bumped
with the winner soon after, saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED AND RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BYE BYE DAVID was fractious in the gate, stalked the pace from the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, took over near the eighth
pole and drew clear under mostly hand urging. AUTHENTIC HEART hit the starting gate, raced in range two and three wide, split rivals in upper stretch, bid
in midstretch but was no match for the winner. POETIC CODE set the pace in the two path to midstretch and weakened. DANGER RANGER was bumped
after the start, prompted the pace three wide between foes and tired in the drive. RAFF'S VENTURE came in and bumped DANGER RANGER soon after
the start, stalked the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. WHERE'S VAL was outrun inside. DEN STREET was fractious in the gate, had his
head turned at the start and made little impact while racing two wide.

Footnotes
THINKABOUTIT set the pace inside, edged away after a half-mile, dug in when challenged by STRAIGHT SHOT into the stretch, and proved narrowly best.
STRAIGHT SHOT cut the corner advancing into the stretch, tipped to the two-path taking a run at THINKABOUTIT from outside, battled head and head
through the final stages and just missed. SMILING TEUFLES was fractious in the gate dislodging the rider, broke slowest and lagged well back for a half,
fanned widest into the lane and rallied mildly. INTER MIAMI was no factor in the second flight throughout. DR. DUKE broke a step slow, raced three wide
and faded after a half. VINNIE VAN GO pressed the pace two wide, and folded up into the stretch.

Footnotes
LOVE HER LOTS settled off the duel in the clear inside, angled three wide nearing the lane, was floated out in upper stretch, seized command in midstretch
and powered clear. DEMOGORGON dueled inside of THATAINT TOOSHABBY around the first turn, settled back early on the backstretch, re-bid two wide
around the far turn, was floated out entering the stretch, bid between foes in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip near the eighth pole and was no
match for the winner late. THATAINT TOOSHABBY dueled two wide around the first turn, cleared off early on the backstretch, set the pace inside around
the far turn, drifted out turning for home, led to midstretch then weakened. BUILT DIFFERENT checked early, saved ground off the pace, bid inside of foes
nearing the eighth pole then flattened out. PAINTBRUSH bumped with CAGUA soon after the start, saved ground off the pace and never threatened.
CAGUA bumped with PAINTBRUSH soon after the start and failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SOUL OF AN ANGEL played no factor while
racing two and three wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE, TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

VINNY DREAM raced close up two to three wide to the stretch, rallied between horses leaving the eighth-pole and edged away late. LORD DARNLEY was
unhurried early, came through on the rail to join the leaders after straightening away for the drive, and continued on willingly. VALHALLA AIR BASE was
outsprinted early, came five wide off the turn and rallied mildly on the far outside. WHISKEYONHISLIPS was difficult to load, vied two wide outside
AMERICAN MATTERS, reached the front on the turn, then weakened with a furlong remaining. SIXTY ONE raced in striking range three to four wide to the
stretch, and faded late on his left lead. BEASTFROMTHEEAST broke a step slowly, and was outrun inside. INEVITABLE ME was shuffled back early on the
turn, and dropped far back. AMERICAN MATTERS showed early speed well off the rail early, and folded after a half-mile.

Footnotes
RHYMES LIKE DIMES was never far back, ranged up three wide to put a head in front from outside at the quarter-pole, and widened through the stretch
under pressure. GRAN ANDREWS was covered up behind the leaders on the turn, moved out to the three-path for clearance at the top of the stretch, and
rallied on his left lead to be clearly second best. MITICO contested the pace outside GUN FOR SUCCESS, got the best of that dispute on the turn, stayed
on to upper stretch before weakening, and salvaged the show. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY raced two to three wide in range, and lacked a solid closing
bid. GUN FOR SUCCESS vied inside MITICO for six furlongs, and gave way. STREET FACTS trailed from the outset, got out steadily leaving the
quarter-pole and dropped far back.

MORNING STRIDE settled off the pace while racing two wide around both turns, tipped four wide in upper stretch, made slight progress while continuing on
the left lead, switched over leaving the eighth pole, kicked in and was up in the final strides. WINNING FACTOR saved ground in range, advanced three
wide around the far turn, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and led until the final strides. A THREAD OF BLUE bumped hard with STIRLING DRIVE not
long after the stat, raced far back three wide early, advanced four and five wide around the far turn and finished well outside. STIRLING DRIVE raced well
back three wide around both turns, bumped with CALL CURT in upper stretch then rallied between foes. J P HELLISH led early, settled back into a stalking
position when JUSTINTIMEFORWINE sprinted to the front around the first turn, re-bid two wide near the quarter pole, led to midstretch then weakened.
CALL CURT raced three and four wide in midpack, bumped with STIRLING DRIVE in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. DUROCHER failed to
menace while racing four and five wide. GO MIKE was soundly bumped soon after the start, saved ground and lacked a closing bid. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE
was sent two wide, cleared midway around the first turn, led to the quarter pole and retreated through the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE, TIMES CHANGED

Footnotes
LOVIN MAKES CENTS raced close up three wide early, reached the front outside IRISH ADVENTURE after straightening away for the drive, and edged
away under pressure. ANNA AND MIA broke slowly, lagged well back two wide to the stretch, and rallied through between horses late to get up for second.
SONGTELLER was forwardly placed early toward the inside, came three wide off the turn and did enough to get the show spot. LADY MACARENA gave
chase outside to the stretch, and weakened late. IRISH ADVENTURE set the pace inside, yielded to the winner in upper stretch, and weakened. LITTLE
BELITA was no factor. OLYMPIC FENCER was never prominent. SOUPSTER bumped with NEVE while outside that rival in the five-path at the top of the
stretch, and posed no threat. KHOWRITER was outrun four wide. JAH broke slowly, and was outrun inside. NEVE bumped with SOUPSTER at the top of
the stretch, and tired. FIVE K KITTEN was always far back.
