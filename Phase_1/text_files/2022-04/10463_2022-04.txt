Footnotes
COLORMEMONEY tracked the fast pace three wide on the turn, was roused in upper stretch, confronted SUNSET DRAGUNN leaving the furlong marker,
took command from that rival and made a late push to edge clear. SUNSET DRAGUNN broke alertly and was sent leaving the start, set quick fractions
while being pressed through the turn, shook free of the pressing rival in upper stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final furlong and was best of the
rest. MONSTRODAMOUS lacked early speed, gained two wide into the stretch run, did not offer a late bid but was clear for third in the end. THAT'S BIND
BABE chased the solid pace from the inside and lacked a late rally in the drive. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET was hustled leaving the break, took back to stalk
the quick pace, advanced on the turn to press the pace nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the end.

Footnotes
ALL was unhurried early on while never far back, was roused four wide into the stretch run, overtook CUTETIP leaving the furlong grounds and had a good
late kick to prevail in the end. HALF HOPING settled just off of the early pace, mounted a five wide bid into the drive, closed well in the late going and was
outkicked by the winner while besting the rest. ROCK N ROLL SONG tracked the moderate pace three deep on the turn and gave way in the final furlong,
while just holding on for third. CUTETIP broke sharply and was hustled to an early clear lead, set moderate fractions into the stretch run, came under
pressure nearing the eighth pole and tired in the final stages. QUICK TIME (GB) stalked the early pace, was two wide through the turn, lacked room leaving
the quarter-marker, was boxed in nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR REVENGE stalked the early pace three wide, advanced on the second turn three wide, took a narrow edge approaching the eighth pole and
kicked clear in the end. ARCH PRINCE was unhurried early on while just off of the rail, gained ground in upper stretch, steadied off of heels nearing the
furlong marker, tipped out for the drive and was outfinished by the winner while clear for second. PAINT ME LUCKY settled three wide off of the early pace,
improved position while four wide on the second turn but was outkicked in the late stages, while just holding for third. BRONZE WARRIOR took back to stalk
the early pace, made a steady advance on the pacesetter into the second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch, drifted in several paths nearing the furlong
marker and weakened in the final sixteenth. COOLCROSS saved ground while just off of the early pace, advanced in upper stretch, was pinched between
rivals inside of the furlong marker when BRONZE WARRIOR drifted in and tired in the late going. BETITO broke alertly and was sent in the early stages, set
solid fractions while being prompted through the half-mile marker, came under pressure nearing the top of the lane, took up inside of the furlong marker
when crowded by rivals and faded in the final stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING THE EIGHTH POLE
AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT BRONZE WARRIOR COST COOLCROSS AND BETITO THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER
PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED BRONZE WARRIOR FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SIXTH.

KITTEN'S KID was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace, was a bit keen along the backstretch run, took a narrow lead nearing the
quarter-marker, shook free of CITY GLITTER leaving the second turn and kicked clear to win in a drive. ACOUSTIC SHADOW stalked the early pace three
wide on the first turn, advanced two wide on the far turn, was outkicked in the final stages by the winner but was an easy runner-up in the end. KOKO'S
MOM saved ground while just off of the pace and did not offer a late response, while clear for third. SHE SHOT ME DOWN was off a step slowly, settled off
of the pace while never far off the rail and lacked a late rally. CITY GLITTER broke alertly and was hustled in the early stages, dueled for pace duties with
the winner through the half-mile marker, gave way into the drive and gave out in the final stages. CONNIE'S PROMISE was a bit fractious in the gate, was
away slowly, settled off of the early pace, was four wide into the backstretch run, lost contact approaching the second turn, was eased through the final
furlong and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
SUMMER APPARITION settled off of the early pace, was roused four wide nearing the quarter-marker, advanced in upper stretch, was put to steady urging
through the lane and responded to that encouragement to make a late push to prevail. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) disputed the pace with MIA SOLINA
through the first half-mile, continued to duel with that foe into upper stretch, took a narrow lead nearing the sixteenth-marker and was outfinished by the
winner, while holding for second. CLASS CODE was four wide along the first turn, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid
on the second turn and was outclosed in the drive, just missing for second while clear of the rest for third. FOGGY BOTTOM stalked the pace while never
far off of the rail and was outkicked in the stretch run. MIA SOLINA broke alertly and was sent early on, contested the pace with CAN'THELPFALLIN
through the quarter-marker, continued to duel with that rival in upper stretch but gave way in the final stages. MANGOTANGO saved ground while settling
off of the pace and did not offer a late rally. NORTHERN ROSE settled off of the early pace, swung four wide into the backstretch run, advanced five wide
on the second turn, was outrun into the drive, was eased in the final furlong and walked off under her own power.

HOT RAGEOUS tracked the quick pace from a two wide path, closed on LAGATHA nearing the furlong grounds, dueled with that game foe and dug in late
to prevail. LAGATHA broke alertly and was hustled to the front early on, set quick fractions through the turn, was confronted by the winner in upper stretch,
dueled to the wire with HOT RAGEOUS and was gamely bested in the end, while clear of the rest for second. GO SMILEY GO chased the fast pace two
wide on the turn and was outkicked by the top pair, while clear for third. ANNIE GRAHAM chased the pace, checked in tight quarters nearing the
three-eighths marker, was shuffled back and swung widest nearing the quarter-marker and lacked a late rally. CROWN KITTEN chased the early pace,
advanced three wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
VISIBLE HOPE showed good early speed while setting fast fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch, felt mild late pressure and dug in
to hold safely in the end. DANCING SOUL was sandwiched at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to chase the early pace, improved position three
wide on the turn, closed in the final furlong to put mild pressure on the winner, could not quite reel in VISIBLE HOPE but was up in the final strides to claim
second. MS MOAB tracked the fast pace two wide on the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch, closed in the final stages and was just edged for the place,
while clear of the rest for the show. PACIFIC ZIP chased the fast pace from a two wide path and lacked a late response. ENGEE OMBEE had good early
speed while tracking the pace, lost ground along the inside on the turn and weakened in the stretch. ORISSA broke in and squeezed DANCING SOUL at
the start, chased the pace to the turn, took up off of heels nearing the three furlong marker and was not a factor. LIL SPANKY was bumped at the start,
chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

MAGICAL THOUGHT settled just off of the early moderate pace, improved position along the far turn, mounted a three wide rally into the drive, overtook
BOLD ARTICLE nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the end. STYLEDOME (IRE) was unhurried in the early stages, shifted to the two path on
the second turn, lacked room leaving the quarter-marker and was blocked in upper stretch, was put to firm urging through the final sixteenth and closed well
in the end to get the nod for second. BOLD ARTICLE was a bit keen early while disputing the pace on the first turn, settled into the backstretch run while
setting contested fractions, took a clear lead into upper stretch, was caught by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and was outfinished, while just
missing for second and holding for third. CASINO GAMES settled off of the early pace while traveling three wide, was roused into the stretch run and closed
willingly in the final stages to just miss for the minor awards. MULHIMA (IRE) settled off of the pace, was steered to the rail along the backstretch run,
gained ground along the inside nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the final furlong. MISS SUPER SAINT prompted the moderate pace, lost position
in upper stretch and weakened in the late going. STATEFOREST was forwardly placed early on, lost ground four wide on the second turn and faded in the
final stages.
