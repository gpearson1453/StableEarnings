Footnotes
SHELL SHOCK pressed the pace early on two wide, raced in the three path into the lane while taking over command, shook off foe down the lane and drew
away late under a steady drive. VERY WEALTHY set the pace early from the inside, was in the two path into the lane while no match for the winner in the
stretch run. YO PUEDO chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. BACHELORETTE tracked the pace
early on, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch. MRS. NUSHI chased the pace early, raced in the four path through the turn and
faded down the lane. CUPID'S STRIKE lost her footing at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the five path
into the lane and improved position. WILLYMAR was done early from the inside. ALLOCATE was never a factor.

Footnotes
WALKATHON raced in the four path along the first turn, stalked the early pace while two wide in the second flight, made a bid three wide nearing the lane,
took over command near the three sixteenths pole and drew clear late under a brisk drive. FRIPPET set the pace from the outset along the inside, was in
the two path into the lane, yielded to the winner nearing the eighth pole and held place in the final stages. PHAROAH'S SONG chased the pace early on,
rolled up to the leaders along the far turn, made a four wide bid into the lane but hung late in the stretch run. ROSIA BAY staggered outward at the start and
raced back early on, was in the three path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. KIVALINA tracked the pace early on from the inside of the
second flight, shifted into the four path entering the lane and weakened late in the stretch. SACRED KITTEN raced in the three path along the first turn, was
in the four path along the far turn, in the five path into the lane and improved position late. PARIS KENTUCKY raced in the three path along the first turn,
was in the five path into the lane while making a bid but faded late in the stretch drive. SPARTINA was never a factor, fanned into the seven path entering
the lane. WHAT'S TO DO raced back early along the inside, lacked room throughout, was steadied in the far turn from the inside. EDYE'S CANDY raced in
the three path along the first turn, pressed the early pace two wide, was in the three path into the lane and empty down the lane. QUARIA DREAM was
bothered at the start, raced in the four path along the far turn and was in the five path entering the lane. THREAVE'S COMPANY was always back.

Footnotes
MOUFFY tracked behind the leaders from the two path around the turn, bid for the lead inside of those foes through a wide rail seam passing the quarter
pole, assumed command shortly after, and drew off. OLIVIA DARLING prompted the pace outside of the leader while kept in the four path by that foe, but
was outkicked by an outer bidding foe as well as an inner rival at the quarter pole, faded in upper stretch, shifted out, yet regained stride in the final furlong,
came again, and reclaimed place in the final sixteenth. QUEROBIN DOURADA perched herself outside of rivals early on while tracking from off of the pace,
ranged up to the leading pair while under strong urging in the five path turning for home, but was outkicked by a ground saving foe entering the lane, chased
that clearing rival through midstretch while claiming place, but tired in the late stages, and lost place. STORM KISS set the pace inside of a pressing rival
while staying well off of the inner railing, which allowed for the eventual winner to produce a rail bid for the lead entering the lane, got surpassed by that foe
and an outer bidding rival leaving the quarter pole as the rider adjusted his goggled, and tired in upper stretch. TALEOFREADYCHIANTI laid off of the pace
in the three path, and failed to factor. KNOWING GLANCE raced close up along the inside, stalked down the backstretch, but faded at the three furlong
pole. LOVELY LISA never got involved.

Footnotes
AUSSIE PRIDE settled off of the pace two wide, gained stride outside of foes into the far turn, picked off rivals in the five path turning for home, completed a
bid for the lead entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and inched away. MAKING IT stalked three wide while in the four path around the first turn,
moved forward to vie for the lead two wide while tucking to the three path into the far turn, forged an advantage passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked
in upper stretch, and was second best. AFJAN bumped with his inner stable-mate at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, tracked down the
backstretch, inched closer under urging around the far turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival turning for home, then kept on through the lane to secure
show. BRIGHT PROSPECTER was moving about when the gate opened and inconsequentially hopped a bit at the start, stalked comfortably along the
inside, but awaited racing room turning for home allowing him to get outmoved by outer rivals, moved between horses entering the lane, then vied inside of
AFJAN for show, but did not have enough. ALWAYS ABOVE trailed early on, took the far turn four wide, and stayed on through the lane for a minor share.
SILVER SPUR bumped an inner rival at the start, came under coaxing to move forward soon after, set the pace while a bit off of the rail, met MAKING IT's
bid around the far turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, and yielded entering the lane. CURLIN'S MALIBU leaned on the inner part of the gate and
came away slowly, then made little impact. STAY RESTLESS bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the three path, but came under a
drive into the far turn, lacked a response, and tired through the final furlong. BRINGER OF RAIN took a bump from an outer rival at the start, jumped over a
break in the inner railing's shadow passing the mile pole causing him to briefly lose action, then laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide
turning for home, and failed to factor. GREYS THE BOY pressed the pace two wide from the three path early on, but faded between horses into the far turn.
MAQAMAT shied from rivals on either side at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
FENWICK STATION set the pace along the inside, shook free of a pressing foe entering the lane, met BRITISH ROYALTY's challenge approaching
midstretch, gamely repelled that rival leaving the furlong grounds, and held firm thereafter. BRITISH ROYALTY bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked
comfortably along the inside, tipped outside of a clear FENWICK STATION while claiming place entering the lane, took aim and inched closer in upper
stretch, but flopped back to his left lead when the rider used a right handed crop at the furlong grounds causing him be turned away, chased the leader
home, and just lasted for place. CIBOLIAN took a minor bump from an outer rival at the start, saved ground in midpack around the turns, tipped outside of
the leading pair after claiming show approaching midstretch, and stayed on well through the final furlong, but missed reeling in a rival for place. REIGNING
SPIRIT saved ground while reserved far off of the pace, tipped off of the rail turning for home, but shifted back to in in upper stretch, moved up inside of foes
in midstretch, and stayed on late. MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) tracked from midpack two wide, tipped four wide passing the quarter pole, delayed his lead
change to the three sixteenths marker, but lacked a kick. RISK TAKING pressed the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and
tired. BLANKET OF ROSES trailed two wide, swung four wide entering the lane while still at the rear, and moved up. CELERITY tracked three wide,
pursued two to three wide around the second turn, but wilted into the far turn and was done early. JIMMY DAN laid off of the pace in the three path and
failed to factor.

Footnotes
MALATHAAT rated off of the quick pace in the four path around the first turn, inched closer under light encouragement three wide around the far turn, bid
entering the lane, forged an advantage passing the furlong grounds while hanging on her left lead, changed over entering the final sixteenth, and held sway
willingy. BONNY SOUTH trailed early on, commenced an advance four wide around the far turn, then rallied outside of foes through the lane to reach place
in the final sixteenth while gaining on the leader. SUPER QUICK vied inside of LADY MYSTIFY early on, allowed that foe to clear entering the backstretch,
set up shop outside while stalking, but required urging to gain around the far turn as an outer MALATAAT rallied alongside, got outkicked by that foe
entering the lane, kept on thereafter to vie for minor rewards, but was outfinished by an outer rival before reaching an inner foe to dead heat at the wire for
show. LADY MYSTIFY vied two wide early on before clearing entering the backstretch, opened up a wide lead soon after while setting a hasty tempo, but
regressed back to the field turning for home, met the eventual winner's bid passing the three sixteenths pole, got headed leaving the furlong grounds,
yielded, and got nailed to dead heat for show. AUDREY'S TIME settled off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, but failed to
factor. CRAZY BEAUTIFUL tracked the top pair from the three path early on, tucked to the rail approaching the far turn, but came under a drive into that
bend to keep pace, failed to do so, and tired.

Footnotes
SHANNON stalked two wide, split the leaders entering the lane, led in the three path in upper stretch, drifted out to the five path while clearing in midstretch,
and held sway through the final furlong. MY LILY MAE laid off of the pace two wide, shifted outside of the leading group to take aim in midstretch, but was
herded a bit further out in the final furlong by a drifting inner foe, but sustained her rally in the late stages to reach place. DEVILLY tracked along the inside,
awaited racing room behind the leader entering the lane, tipped to the three path straightening, then chased the clear leader to vie for place in midstretch,
but was outfinished by an outer rival for that position. MUSICAL DESIGN pressed the leader while intentionally a path away from that foe, got outkicked by
an inner foe-splitting rival passing the quarter pole, shifted out to chase that foe through upper stretch, but drifted outwardly in the final furlong, and tired.
LADY PELE settled far back along the inside, and stayed on. ON THE RISE saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, but only
managed to chase before fading. MS MERRABEL set the pace along the inside, but weakened in upper stretch. TEASING bumped an outer foe and was
quickly taken back to recover, impeded COLONEL ABY B in the process, then laid off of the pace three wide, but made little impact. COLONEL ABY B took
bumps from rivals on either side while steadying in tight quarters soon after the start, and never got involved. HONORABLY bumped with an inner foe at the
start, got hung out in the five path around the turn while tracking in midstretch, but faded while getting floated to the eight path entering the lane. JAZZ TIME
GIRL bumped with rivals on either side at the start, tracked in the four path around the turn, but shifted to the seven path entering the lane before tiring. ICY
RIVER came out and bumped a foe soon after the start, stalked three wide early on, but chased the leaders while among foes around the turn, and
weakened.
