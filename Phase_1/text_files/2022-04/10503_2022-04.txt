BETWEEN was kept close, advanced two wide on the bend, was all out the final sixteenth and edged ahead in the waning yards. PRETTY LADY TOO
broke alertly, showed the way from inside but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. APPLE VALLEY raced forwardly between rivals, was three wide
taking the bend then lacked the needed late kick. RULER DAENERYS saved ground on the turn, swung out five wide for a clear path at the top of the lane
but lacked a significant response. MINI DRESS in contention early, lost ground four wide through the turn and gave way for the drive. MY LADY SLEW was
a brief factor from outside, angled inside upper stretch and steadily yielded. DANGER KENNEDY left the gate without her rider and was declared a
non-starter. There was a stewards' inquiry into DANGER KENNEDY'S start. After their review, the stewards determined DANGER KENNEDY was
unprepared to race when the gate opened and she was declared a non-starter.

Footnotes
KITCHEN FIRE shared the early lead between rivals, moved ahead on the bend then prevailed under steady urging. FRONTANA forwardly placed from the
beginning, commenced his bid three wide on the turn, fanned out to path five for the stretch run, lacked the needed late bid but caught GONEGHOST for
second. GONEGHOST prominent just off the inside, swung three wide for the stretch run, advanced between rivals, lugged in some once inside the last
furlong and finished evenly. WILLOW RIDGE lost ground widest through the bend but showed a willingness to run late. ROAD GAME chased from inside,
had a striking position midstretch but flattened out instead. GREAT SCAT displayed early speed from outside, came four wide into the stretch and yielded.
STRATE REMARK disputed the pace while hustled along early, had the rail on the turn then gave way the final two furlongs.

Footnotes
MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH set a pressured pace between rivals early, was challenged on the bend then gradually drifted out as he opened up the last eighth.
RAHFEE TOWN went for the lead outside MAGIC MAN'S TOUCH on the turn, proved no match for that one when set down for the drive, moved inside
deep stretch and was clearly second best. LINE OF DENHAMS without early speed, lost ground widest through the bend but passed tired ones in the
stretch to gain third late. IT'S BELLAMY TIME prominent from inside early, angled out for the stretch run and flattened. FIXICO trailed, angled out four wide
on the turn and failed to have a significant stretch bid. SKIP THE SMALLTALK hustled along early, faded two wide on the bend. GREENSPAN improved
position three wide on the turn but came up empty for the drive.

GIRLOLAMO'GLORY was a step slow at the break, hustled along from outside, three to five wide taking the bend, was all out in the lane and got up in time.
MARCO'S DREAM shared the early lead from between rivals, edged ahead in the stretch, fought gamely but did not have enough left in the waning yards.
ITALIAN CHARM in contention from inside, squeezed through along the rail leaving the bend, threatened midstretch but finished evenly. SIRCORRI pressed
from inside, angled out for a clear path on the turn, came four wide into the lane, had every chance but lacked the needed late kick. STUMP was an early
factor, lost ground following GIRLOLAMO'GLORY through the turn then gave way for the drive. PEACOCK MAN displayed early speed from inside but also
faded in the lane.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S DOMAIN rated on the front end from inside, moved ahead when asked entering the lane then steadily opened up while kept to urging. MISS
WINDY SLEW vied for the lead outside GHAALEB'S DOMAIN to the stretch, was no match for that one, gradually wore down in the late going but lasted for
the place. STARSOVERPARADISE was a factor toward the outside on the backstretch, angled out five wide upper stretch, made up minor ground the last
eighth and got up for third. TENSE saved ground and gave an even effort. RENDLAKE pressed the early speed from outside but failed to have a significant
stretch bid. MOON PIES IMAGE chased from outside, came five wide into the lane and had no rally. SWEET FRAULEIN void of speed from the outside,
angled in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. LORI ATTACK chased from between rivals and was never a factor. SHINE DOWN showed little.

Footnotes
MEGAN'S HONOR vied for the lead outside W W HOTSHOT from the beginning, battled through the lane and edged ahead in time. W W CANDY without
early speed, was forced inward nearing the half mile marker, altered out for room on the bend, lost further ground fanning five wide into the lane, slowly
drifted out under left-handed pressure upper stretch, gradually lugged in through the waning yards when switched to right-handed urging, came up a bit
short for the win but finished on even terms with W W HOTSHOT. The latter disputed the pace first from between rivals then gained the inside into the bend,
fought gamely through the stretch but had to settle for second best. STALLONE broke well but soon was chasing others, angled in some nearing the half
mile pole, swung out four wide on the turn and had no stretch bid. DARK NINJA displayed early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing two
furlongs. NORTH SIDE was an early factor but gave way between rivals on the bend. Due to a timing malfunction, only the first fraction was hand timed.

PLAY TWENTY overcame bumping solidly with ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE then jostling with PRANCIPANTS to soon gain the lead, moved clear on the turn,
steadily drifted out through the lane but prevailed. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE bumped solidly with PLAY TWENTY at the break, was settled, advanced from
inside on the turn, came off the rail some upper stretch and was closing in on the latter in the waning yards. GHAALEB'S RANGER broke inward, jostled
with PRANCIPANTS, did not keep up just off the rail on the bend, moved inside ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE upper stretch, threatened with a furlong to go but
leveled off in the late going. LINDALOUIMAGE soon trailed, stayed four wide on the turn, moved out widest upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. DIAMOND GUCCI displayed early speed from outside but began to yield from path three on the bend. PRANCIPANTS recovered from jostling
between foes at the start to help prompt the pace but gave way for the drive. ROMANTIC ATTACK raced in contention from outside to the lane then faded.
