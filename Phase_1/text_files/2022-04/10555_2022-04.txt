Footnotes
RELENTLESS DANCER tracked two wide, tipped five wide entering the lane, grinded away on his left lead through upper stretch to bid at the furlong
grounds, and cleared in the final sixteenth. YES HE CAN stalked along the inside, shifted off of the rail entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival
while splitting foes two wide in upper stretch, then vied inside of COPPER TOWN for place, and prevailed. COPPER TOWN stalked three wide, bid turning
for home, got floated four wide entering the lane, vied with a narrow advantage through midstretch, but was outkicked by rivals on either side entering the
final sixteenth. SPYCRAFT pressed two wide, vied between horses turning for home, drifted three wide entering the lane, and yielded to rivals on either side
leaving the furlong grounds. AMERICAN MANDATE set the pace, led from a pair of bidders turning for home before another outer pair of rivals made bids in
upper stretch, and gave way to those foes at the furlong pole. SILENT MOVIES was outrun.

Footnotes
ATRAS tracked two wide and between horses, gained turning for home, tipped out four wide entering the lane, produced a good turn of foot in the six path in
upper stretch to drive clear of inner foes approaching the furlong grounds, and inched further away. SAY IT LOUD broke a step slowly, saved ground off of
the pace, picked up stride inside of foes in upper stretch, split rivals two wide at the furlong grounds, but after ATRAS got a jump, claimed place shortly after,
and was second best. TREVISE stalked along the inside, moved off of the rail turning for home, passed the quarter pole three wide, chased between horses
while getting outkicked by an outer eventual winner, the was outkicked for place by an inner rival passing the furlong grounds for place, and held show.
MUSTAZEED laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted outwardly at the furlong grounds, and moved up between horses late. RUM 'N TONIC pressed
the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the leader while in the four path entering the lane, yielded while hanging on his left lead
and made mild contact with a rallying outer rival in upper stretch, changed over at the furlong grounds, but continued to tire. UPTOWN HUSTLER tracked
from midpack four wide around the turn, was asked to shift outwardly passing the quarter pole, delayed his lead change through upper stretch while lacking
a rally, and made little impact. DOM GERVASIO broke slowly, swung to the five path entering the lane, and improved. FLOYD G saved ground off of the
pace, but to no avail. LASTTRAINTOBOSTON set the pace, shook clear of a pressing rival entering the lane, hung on his left lead while tiring approaching
midstretch, then changed leads at the furlong grounds, but stopped. LAWMAKER pressed three wide, but faded between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
DIXIE'S TWO STENTS settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out turning for home, tipped five wide in upper stretch, rallied with a good kick to bid
at the furlong grounds, and readily drove clear. HATCH laid off the pace three wide, ranged up turning for home, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied to
bid for the lead along with an outer DIXIE'S TWO STENTS at the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, but was swiftly outkicked and proved
second best. LIBERTY STAR stalked three wide, got outkicked by a pair of outer foes in upper stretch, then kept on to reach show. WELLMAN trailed two
wide into the turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and moved up. DARK TIMBER set the pace two wide early on, cleared into the turn, managed a
clear margin through upper stretch, but hit a wall entering the final furlong, and stopped. ONCOMING TRAIN tracked from the inside while a bit off of the rail,
and faded. COFFEE WITH ALEX rushed early on to vie for the lead inside of DARK TIMBER, but failed to keep pace into the turn, chased around the bend,

Footnotes
EMERALD laid off of the pace two to three wide, gained in the five path into the far turn, swept past foes to lead passing the five sixteenths pole, and drew
off through the lane. JEWELOFAKID tracked three to two wide, tipped outside of the leading trio at the half mile pole, bid at the five sixteenths along with an
outer EMERALD,, but offered little resistance turning for home, and was second best. LANTERN'S CANDY trailed along the inside, gained three wide and
between horses turning for home, and stayed on for a minor share. FROSTED DIAMOND raced far back two wide, inched closer four wide around the far
turn, but leveled off through the lane. SALIT settled far back, took the far turn in the five path, and improved. FOREVER HOME stalked three wide, led
briefly into the far turn, tucked soon after as a pair of outer rivals made bids around that bend, got outkicked turning for home, and weakened in upper
stretch. BAYOU WIND tracked along the inside, chased in the three path around the far turn, and faded. CLASSY MISS laid unhurried along the inside, but
was shuffled back behind the stopping early pace-setters turning for home, and made little impact. WHY LEA never got involved. BABY BLUE EYES
pressed two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn, and was eased turning for home. OAXACA set the pace along the inside, but weakened
into the far turn, stopped turning for home, then was pulled up in the final sixteenth, and got vanned off.

Footnotes
NEVISIAN SUNRISE hopped a bit before brushing with an inner foe at the start, moved forward to set the pace, dictated terms unencumbered via moderate
fractions, widened her advantage when set down in upper stretch, and held safely from an outer oncharging rival. SEASONS settled in midpack in the two
path, tracked while awaiting racing room behind rivals around the far turn, shifted out to the five path passing the quarter pole, but lost ground to the clear
leader in the process, quickly picked up stride approaching the final furlong, rallied to claim place entering the final sixteenth, and was gaining on the leader
late. ENSEMBLE (IRE) tracked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn, vied for place in pursuit of the clear leader through upper stretch, but
was outkicked for that position entering the final sixteenth. INFINITE POTENTIAL (IRE) stalked along the inside, vied for place through upper stretch while
chasing the clear leader, then tired late. COMMANDERS PALACE laid off of the pace three wide, got fanned to the six path entering the lane, and faded.
RUNAWAY MOM laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, and made little impact. DESIGNER READY trailed around both turns, and never got
involved. JOY OF PAINTING stalked two wide, but faded between horses in midstretch. LUBNA (GB) saved ground off of the pace, but tired.

Footnotes
CASA DE GOAT set a clear pace from the outset, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the three path entering the lane and drew off down the lane
while ridden out to the wire. CATWINGS stalked the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive
down the lane competing for place and prevailed for that position at the wire. PLEASE BE KIND stalked the pace early on, raced in the four path along the
turn, was in the five path into the lane, under a long drive in the stretch while competing for place but just missed for that position at the wire. MUSIC
STREET chased the pace early while widest, was shuffled back entering the turn, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the six path into the lane and
moved up late in the stretch run. TOFFEE was through after a half from the inside. FAITH'S REWARD bobbled at the start, chased the pace early on, raced
in the four path through the turn and faded down the lane. LOVELY PRINCESS was bumped at the start and done early. SWEET BABY RAY was never a
factor.

Footnotes
MARKET RUMOR raced in the three path along the first turn, tracked the early pace, was three wide along the far turn, in the five path entering the lane,
made a bid three wide down the lane, under a long drive and prevailed at the wire. GAM'S MISSION raced in the three path along the first turn while back
early on, was three wide along the far turn, in the six path into the lane, rallied down the lane widest while gaining with every stride but just missed at the
wire. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) set the pace from the outset, raced in the three path into the lane, maintained the advantage near the eighth pole while under
pressure, was put under a long drive, led late but was caught nearing the wire. SARANYA stalked the early leader, raced from between horses along the far
turn, was in the four path into the lane, loomed large near the eighth pole but hung in the final stages. TAKE CHARGE RO chased the pace early, was in the
five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and finished willingly in the late stages. WHIMSICAL MUSE was constantly steadied into and along the first
turn, raced in the four path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. I HEAR YOU raced on the inside along the first turn while back early on, was
in the three path into the lane and lacked a bid down the lane. NICENO was never a threat. ZAMZAM was never a factor. SWEET ENOUGH (GB) fought
restraint along the first turn, settled along the backstretch and had nothing left in the stretch drive.

under a long drive and prevailed in the final stages. UNIKEE vied for the lead early on, took over command, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear
in the stretch, lugged out a bit and was caught in the final stages under a long drive. B SUDD raced back early on, was in the seven path into the lane, made
a bid in the stretch but flattened out late in the drive. LEGENDARY LORE chased the pace early, raced four wide along the turn, was in the five path into the
lane, made a bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. BRITAIN'S KITTEN bobbled at the start and trailed the field early on, was in the six path into
the lane and moved up in the stretch run. SLIM SLOW SLIDER was bothered at the start, stalked the pace early, raced three wide along the turn, was in the
