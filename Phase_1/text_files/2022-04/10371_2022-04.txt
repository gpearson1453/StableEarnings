SUMMARY JUDGMENT vied inside, moved clear easily on the turn and pulled away confident handling. PUMPERNICKEL broke very slowly, advanced
quickly inside but was no match for the winner. FRAME THIS dropped far behind then advanced wide to get up for the show. TRIBORD prompted the pace
three wide then weakened after half a mile. TITANIC ROSE dropped back in the two path and gave way readily. THROMBOCYTOPENIA was urged close
up wide to midway on the turn and faltered. CALL THE PO PO led narrowly in the opening quarter then stopped after half a mile.

ROUGH TOUGH LOVE hustled to the front, opened a long lead on the turn then stayed safe tiring while kept to her task. CUP OF LIFE sluggish early,
rallied inside to the stretch, angled out and closed well. AFILADA lacked speed, moved inside on the turn and rallied along the rail. ARUMA settled off the
pace outside, moved very wide on the turn and stretch. SANTAFE EXPRESS chased off the the leaders down the backstretch and lacked a bid. FREEDOM
CHEER trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. MARTINI TWIST flashed speed along the inside then stopped in the stretch. LASSIE'S NOTION
prompted the pace in the opening quarter then weakened steadily.

CHELSEA WALL lacked speed inside, swung wide into the stretch then drifted in slightly contributing to the crowding of the third finisher. AEGEAN SEA set
a clear pace to the late stages then drifted out tiring late crowding the third finisher. CONFIRMED GENIUS pursued the loose pacesetter, was taken up
between rivals late. POOR NO MORE saved ground throughout then flattened out in the stretch. CLOSET SHOPPER lacked speed racing well behind and
lacked a rally. LEAN ON E urged three wide early and weakened steadily. LULA'S ROADRUNNER chased wide off the leaders and was never in
contention. TOMARIE lagged far behind trailed throughout. Following a stewards inquiry and objections by the third finisher against the top pair CHELSEA
WALL was disqualified and placed second and AEGEAN SEA was disqualified and placed third.

late and missed. MACLEAN'S LEGACY lagged far behind, moved extremely wide closing the gap. VOY A TI chased very wide on the turn and continued
willingly. DANCING DRAGON vied between rivals down the backstretch and faltered. MAJESTIC SKY saved ground off the pace and faded. GIMME A
JAMESON urged close up between rivals then gave way. RUN HAPPY STAR chased wide between rivals down the backstretch and stopped. A claim of
