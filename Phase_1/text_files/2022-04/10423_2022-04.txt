Footnotes
GOLD NOTE stalked the pace while saving ground to the far turn, angled out to move three wide and wore down R DUB through the lane to gain the edge
at the wire. R DUB made theh pace on a short lead inside rivals and could not contain the winner late. BUBBAS DIXIE failed to rally two and three wide.
HYPER DRIVE tracked the leaders three wide and weakened. AMERIPOINT prompted the early pace outside, pulled up entering the backstretch and was
vanned off.

late. BACKCHATTER was four wide in the turn and failed to rally. IMA SUNNY SONG was four and five wide through the turn and never threatened.
REALTOR DANNY D was four wide on the turn and came widest into the lane while trailing.

IMAGE was along the inside and lacked a late bid. HALO JAX tracked the winner's pace three wide and weakened. BUD MINISTER was not a threat three
wide. SIDE STREET DAVE weakened four wide.

OUTRUN THE POSSE was on the lead racing out from the rail inside rivals, edged clear nearing the lane then held safe in the lane. DANCE FOR RANSOM
tucked in behind the leaders into the turn and made a mild gain but could not run down the winner. BIG MACINTOSH prompted the pace three to four wide
and lacked the needed late rally. PIERPONT was three and four wide just off the leaders and lacked a final closing run. CREAKY CRICKET lacked a rally
three wide. CORRANA EN LIMEN failed to make a bid racing out from the rail. THEBOYZDELIGHT was not a threat. AMACE trailed.

L B GOLD saved ground in behind the pace early, moved out in the turn to rally two and three wide into the lane and went clear under steady handling.
BARTENDERS MISTAKE rallied three wide in the far turn and continued with a mild run to gain the place late while no threat to the winner. YE BE JUDGED
made the pace while pressed to the far turn then came up empty once headed nearing the lane and could not hold the place. CHARED moved up three
wide to challenge going to the far turn and weakened. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN saved ground and was not a factor. SUPER CHARLIE prompted the pace
outside YE BE JUDGED to the far turn and tired. KAMIKAZE JUDGE followed the pace four wide and tired.

HARLONS COMMISION sprinted off to a clear early lead, made all the running and was kept to urging in the lane. EVEN PANDURA chased the winner out
from the rail and slowly closed the gap through the lane. LONG MONDAY saved ground and made a mild rally in the drive. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS
followed the pace three wide and lacked a rally. GOODNIGHTLOVING lacked a bid racing two to three wide. WITT'S TENNY TEN stumbled at the start and
had no rally four wide. MEAN ERIKA was not a factor.

and moved well clear for the place. MOON LOVIN moved nearest the winner along the inside through the far turn and weakened. SPILLED PERFUME
made a mild four wide bid into the far turn and weakened. COUVERTURE was always back three wide. MY RACING HEART was just off the early pace
between rivals and weakened. AIR WALKER was not a factor. TALE OF THE TAVERN showed some early speed outside the winner, gave way going to
