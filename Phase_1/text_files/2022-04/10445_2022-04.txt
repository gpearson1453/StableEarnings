Footnotes
TWILIGHT YEARS rated a short lead inside, was met nearing the three eighths pole but recovered the advantage past the pole, contested the edge nearest
the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to inch clear approaching the wire. RED HOT TODDY stalked off the rail, challenged at even terms nearing
the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and appeared a close factor to late stretch before reluctantly ceding.
WATCHING SNOW FLY rated off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran
evenly in the stretch. SPECTACULO rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the four path of
the far turn, though, flattened in the stretch duel for third. SMALL PAW raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths, left the turn widest and showed little more. CHIPPEWA'S CASTLE stalked the early pace off the rail,
challenged nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back from between horses at the quarter pole and weakened leaving the turn. SUGAR LIPS saved
ground.

nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn, dueled clear for second later yards and finished well. TRINGALE bobbled
at the break but accelerated to the lead three wide approaching the first turn then moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure at the three
eighths pole, gave up the lead toward the quarter then flattened inside the eighth pole. ROOKIE SALSA settled off the pace inside, bid nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little more. RRACE DAY WARRIOR raced just off the early pace inside but faded past the three

Footnotes
SUZANNE'S SUGAR took the lead leaving the half mile pole and rated the pace, widened at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled through the
stretch. JESS FOR KICKS gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and dug in to take second the final stride. NOBLE CITY engaged in close
early chase, rounded the turn near the rail, was steadily handled through the lane but nipped from second under the wire. MARY BROWN gave chase,
rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. SEE THAT GIRL raced well back from early contention and could only improve her positon while
drifting to the five path on the turn. EVA'S GIRL GRACE chased, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little further. REGAL JORDAN gave chase
inside then faded at the rail on the turn. TELL ALEXIS, SPEEDING TICKET and FAIRY FOLLY were all not factors. The half mile fraction was hand timed.
