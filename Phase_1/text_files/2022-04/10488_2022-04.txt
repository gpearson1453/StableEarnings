Footnotes
JUST ABOUT ENOUGH dueled from inside early, inched ahead to take control on the first turn, shook free leaving the second bend and held safely. BLUE
STAR settled in the two path off the pace, swung out leaving the far turn, closed well and got up for the place. ATTENZIONE broke a bit slow and outward,
moved to the inside trailing the field, tipped two wide on the far turn while sitting behind rivals, found a seam and rallied between runner and gained the
show. MOGOLLON RIM rated on the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and finished evenly through the final furlong. FORE FLAG stalked the pace
outside a rival, entered the lane two wide, moved out a bit and lacked a late bid. DARK MARCUS broke a step slow then drifted out out soon after the start
and got corrected, traveled on the inside into the first turn, moved out three deep on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and flattened out. COOL
ACCLAIM dueled from outside first time through the stretch then pressed in the middle stages, chased the winner three wide into the lane and weakened.

ELECTOR took a light bump leaving the and was sent for the front, set the pace while clear and saved ground through the turn, urged right-handed in the
drive and remained clear to the wire. RIFEY sat off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, moved out at the top of the lane and put in a mild
rally to gain second. MCLAREN VALE broke in and lightly bumped ELECTOR at the start then lost his path shortly after, chased within range outside the top
pair, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and faltered in the late stages. BRUTTO away quickly from the gate, was
prominent early to the outside of the pacesetter, bid two wide then got floated inward in upper stretch and flattened out in the late stages. ZIMBA WARRIOR
unhurried in the early going, went two wide into the turn, traveled a bit off the rail then swung out and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
SONG OF FIRE got put in tight down along the rail prior to the first turn then became rank around the bend, settled into a stalking position on the
backstretch, angled out in upper stretch, rallied alongside the leader with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. LOOKIN SO LUCKY got crowded between
and took back early, traveled between foes into the first turn, got shuffled back around the bend, rated along the inside up the backstretch, angled out into
the stretch, closed well and gained second. ST HELENA showed early speed to duel into the first turn while becoming rank, pressed from outside up the
backstretch, lost touch briefly into the far turn, re-engaged at the five-sixteenths pole, took over with a quarter mile left to run, led into deep stretch but
yielded late. A THOUSAND DREAMS dueled for the lead from inside then took control, cleared briefly into the far turn, challenged again by ST HELENA
midway around the turn, lost the lead inside the quarter pole, fought back from inside to deep stretch and faltered late. HERE COMES RALPHIE chased
three deep early, moved to the two path, exited the far turn three to four wide and could not rally. STARSHIP SKY broke a step slow, taken down to the
inside, pulled around the first turn behind LOOKIN SO LUCKY, traveled along the inside then two wide into the lane and never threatened. WILD ARCH
went three wide while outside a rival early, raced near the back in the middle stages, traveled two then three wide on the far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
HOUNDSTOOTH well placed to the outside of the dueling pair, challenged three deep on the turn, fought between rivals and took control in upper stretch,
drifted in while clearing past the eight pole and drew off in the final sixteenth. HAPPY RUNNER settled off the inside, moved closer four wide around the
turn, bid widest at the top of the lane, lugged in badly throughout the stretch run despite the rider's best efforts to correct with the left hand but was still
clearly second best. MAXIM MOMENT stalked the pace from inside, tipped to the two path on the turn, lacked room behind rivals midway around the bend,
gained a clear path and was along for the show. TAHOE SECRETS dueled for command outside a rival to the turn, disposed of that one midway around the
bend then fought with a pair of outer rivals to the stretch, could not kick on approaching the furlong grounds and faded out of contention. VETOED chased at
the back, went three then four wide around the turn and was not persevered with in the furlong grounds. BELMONT BILL dueled for command up the
backstretch, fought back early on the turn, lost touch with five-sixteenths remaining and gave way.

Footnotes
WAR AT SEA chased three deep early then outside a rival on the backstretch, closed in on the far turn, bid three deep in upper stretch and inched ahead in
the final sixteenth. ECHOSMITH (IRE) sped clear and opened up a comfortable lead, coaxed along around the far turn, led two wide into the lane, clung to
the slim advantage entering the furlong grounds, lost command shortly after and stayed on to hold second. DOITFORANDREW (GB) broke well then
became rank early down on the inside, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, angled four wide around the far turn, rallied four deep in upper stretch but
lacked the needed late kick in the end. BARSABAS allowed to settle early on, chased three wide into the lane, steered out and became a bit erratic in the
drive, then summoned a late rally and missed the show. ST ANTHONY chased in the two path then moved inside, put in a bid along the rail in the drive but
needed to find more in deep stretch. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) pulled early while trying to be rated, settled on the inside, moved out a bit in the lane and
could not rally. BALADI got shuffled and bumped leaving the gate, suffered another shuffle between rivals soon after, raced at the back four wide into the
lane and never got involved. ARRABIATA reserved in the early going and went three then two wide around the first turn, saved ground on the second bend
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SWEET CALIFORNIA set all the pace on the inside to the stretch and held gamely over the runner-up. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE chased along the inside
then two wide into the stretch, put in a late bid from outside but was not enough to get by. ALEX'S GIRL chased four deep early, navigated the turn four
wide, flattened in the final furlong but saved the show. GOOD BOO JOO off slow to begin, raced three wide the turn, came two wide into the lane, steered
out and summoned a mild response to round out the superfecta. TEQUILA TIGRE was off slow to begin, saved ground around the turn and failed to
threaten. STEEL NERVES tracked three wide into the turn, steered out and exited the bend five wide and failed to menace. PALEO'S PRINCESS broke
inward then raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, started to weaken between rivals with a quarter mile left to run and tired in the drive. BOSSY
PEGASUS dropped back early, trailed far back into the stretch and passed tired rivals. SHEILA'S CHARLIE forwardly placed between rivals early, dropped
back around the turn and faded. DREAMER GIRL threw her head and broke slow, raced outside a rival six wide on the turn and came up empty.
LYINATTHEBAR chased five wide through the turn and weakened.

FLY THE SKY stumbled badly leaving the gate and almost unseated the rider, Hernandez recovered impressively and was able to regain his irons shortly
after, settled inside, tipped out to the two path on the far turn, split foes in upper stretch, steered out in the final furlong, surged late outside the top pair and
nailed NILES CHANNEL in the closing moments. NILES CHANNEL broke out and hit the gate, bumped rival and tossed his head in a rough beginning,
bumped with outside rival first time through the stretch, raced outside the top pair four wide around the first turn, cleared up the backstretch and moved
inward, dueled into and down the lane, held command into the final sixteenth and got nailed in the final strides. FRONTIER MARKET chased outside rivals
and bumped early, settled in the two path outside a runner, came three wide into the stretch, angled out and closed well to get the show honors. IRISH
HEATWAVE rated in the two path, checked and altered out at the nine-sixteenths pole, tugged forward and challenged from outside on the far turn, dueled
down the lane, drifted in and steadied past the sixteenth pole and was overtaken for the place and show. LIBERAL (IRE) suffered a solid bump leaving the
gate, traveled near the back of the field early on, angled four wide leaving the far turn and needed to find more in deep stretch. DUBBY DUBBIE dueled from
outside early, led between rivals early on the backstretch, taken back at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the drive and could not rally. HOOP
DREAM showed early speed and steered to the inside, dueled for command early then chased past the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground to the stretch
and weakened. BIG BUZZ off slow, bumped and pinched back between rivals at the start, trailed two to three wide into the lane and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPECIAL RIDE sent to take command early and set the pace inside a trio of rivals up the backstretch, showed the way along the inside through the turn,
drifted in when urged right-handed midstretch, then drew off in the late stages. FAMOUS STAR pressed from between rivals then outside the leader,
followed the SPECIAL RIDE while in the two path around the bend, pressured that rival again into the lane, drifted out then back inward in the lane and
could match the winner in the furlong grounds. HERO STATUS broke in and brushed BLETCHELY PARK, chased off the pace, went three deep into the
turn, exited the bend five wide and outkicked TROUBADOUR for third. TROUBADOUR raced in mid-pack and steered to the inside, saved ground around
the turn and got edged by HERO STATUS for the show. BLETCHLEY PARK brushed from outside at the start, raced up close three deep early on, chased
three wide around the bend and weakened. PALAGIO broke a step slow, traveled near the back of the pace early, raced outside a rival into the turn, came
four wide into the stretch, drifted in late and failed to threaten. BREAKFAST RIDE broke well from the far outside, was prominent early four deep up the
backstretch, chased four wide into the lane, got crowded a bit between rivals at the eighth pole and weakened. TENTH STREET DON traveled in mid-pack
in the early going, gave chased between rivals on the turn then two wide past the quarter pole and lacked further response. PRACTICAL IMPACT broke
slow, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch and failed to menace. SWINDLER also broke slow, trailed four to five wide on the turn and had
little left for the drive.
