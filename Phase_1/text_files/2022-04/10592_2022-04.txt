Footnotes
THE ONE FOR FUN was five wide going into the first turn then moved to the three path to track the leaders down the backstretch, made a bid coming out of
the second turn to and wore down the leader to be just up. NORA'S LEGACY was positioned just off the pace two wide through the first turn and down the
backstretch then moved to challenge leader on the second turn to take the lead in mid turn, cleared and battled inside of THE ONE FOR FUN to the wire
and was denied. FAVORITE SISTER went four wide into the first turn and was allowed to settle in the two path down the backstretch, made a two wide rally
to be up for the show. WEST COAST TEMPLE raced in the middle of the pack and improved position late. HEIGHTEN sprinted to the lead from the inside,
set the pace for a half tried to fight off rival for a furlong into the stretch and tired. BELLA BLU stalked the pace from the inside but never made a bid. SAVE
THE DAY raced back of the field and was never a threat. FRACTIONS ADDED AND FINAL CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
INCA EMPIRE was unhurried early for the first half then made a four wide bid on the turn to close willingly and prevailed. MISTY'S FOOL saved ground off
the rail, slipped through to take the lead briefly at the quarter pole and fought rivals through the stretch to be second best. LEGIONARY vied for the lead
from the two path and fought gamely through the stretch drive. BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY was four wide into the first turn then allowed to settle, bid on the
second turn but lacked room going into the stretch then had a late try. FRIGERATOR was three wide into the first turn and down the backstretch angled out
to go five wide into the stretch but had no late kick. STEELS ALL IN pressed the pace from two wide, led between calls and gave way late. EVAN'S ENVY
set the early pace from just off the rail and tired after a half.

Footnotes
LAVA BOMB was in the middle of the pack on the inside then angled out five wide into the stretch and inched closer to be up in the final strides. RAPID
EXPANSION raced in the middle of the pack move four wide going into the stretch while gaining on the leaders but was out finished late. EURO TRACKING
was well placed early then split foes in the stretch drive and just missed. TRUE DOMINUS dueled for the lead from four wide, led briefly and fought gamely
through the stretch. RAINBOW GOLD dueled for lead from three wide to lead briefly and gave way late. HAMMER DOWN dueled for lead while being two
wide and tired in the stretch. POWER WIZARD raced near the back made a mild bid on the turn but failed to menace. PAID THE PORTER was last away
then ran up on the heels of rival and was taken up to be no threat. EARS TO ME sprinted away from the gate and raced close up then stopped.
