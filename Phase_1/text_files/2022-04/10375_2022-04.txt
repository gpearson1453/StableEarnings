IT'S INEVITABLE stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished well in the drive to edge clear under
strong handling. STRONG WOMAN showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside and couldn't match strides with the winner in the stretch run
to finish second best. RIVER CHARMER pressed the early leader down the backstretch, raced three wide through the lane and weakened. HONOR
GRADUATE was slow early, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no rally. SWIFTY DAWN failed to sustain a bid while racing from the inside.

Footnotes
LOOKING WEST was allowed to settle early, moved up five wide through the far turn and finished well to just get up under all out pressure. MRSG'S LIL
DREAMER showed good early speed from the outside to set the early pace, led deep stretch and was caught on the wire in a game effort. OH NIKI was
unhurried early on, raced along the inside through the far turn into the stretch and moved up late with a good rail bid. SILVER POM POM was forwardly
placed early on to lay up close near the inside, raced four to five wide through the stretch run and had no final winning bid. RAINING pressed the early pace
and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. SING ONE FOR MAMA stalked the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late
response. EUROBELLA dropped back early, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. SCORNED LOVER raced six wide into the upper stretch and
never was a serious threat. ONE CLASSY CHICK was slow early on and trailed.

EUROTIGRE showed good early speed to set the pace from the outside and raced well clear in the stretch run under strong handling. SWEET STORMY
ELLE was coaxed along from the inside down the backstretch and was no match for the winner in the drive. SHE'S SO SMARTY was allowed to settle to
the middle of the pack, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. FIERY LUCK raced in tight quarters in the early stages,
was near the inside and had no late rally. TWICE AS GOOD was sent along early to stalk the top pair, dropped back through the far turn, raced near the
inside throughout and had no response. HOLLYSROYALDEFENSE was off slowly, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor.
ONE QUICK CHICK was off slowly and trailed.

backstretch, challenged the leader through the far turn but couldn't get by in the drive to finish second best. MISTY'S FOOL was allowed to settle early,
raced five wide near the seven eighths pole, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. SUPER D'ORO was off a step slow,
raced near the back of the pack early, was five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. SMART CALL was off a step slow, stalked
the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DIRT BIKE SLADE stalked the pace, raced three wide and tired. POLLARD'S XPRESS
dropped back in the early stages, raced three wide in the stretch run and had no response. MAJOR GRIFFIN stalked the pace from the outside, raced five
to six wide through the upper stretch and tired. HIGHLIGHT REEL raced towards the inside and never threatened.
