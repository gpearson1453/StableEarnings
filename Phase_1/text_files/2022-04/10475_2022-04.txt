MINNESOTA MIRACLE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and held on well for the win. TURN ON THE MAGIC raced within contention, forwardly
placed throughout, made a late bid and finished willingly. GENTRIFIED void of early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a wide gain,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. DREWCITABLE pressed the early pace and weakened down the home stretch. HERE COMES
MAGIC raced in the middle of the field and finished evenly on the inside. WISE GUY lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn and was never a
factor. SOCIAL AFLEET always raced near the back and showed little. PEPPER JACK raced within striking distance, saved ground and dropped to the rear.

for the top two. I'M A SPECIAL STAR pressed the early pace, weakened and lacked a late kick. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG vied for the early lead, raced
outside around the turn and was finished early. G DON'T KNOW broke a step slow, racing in the rear, improved position, finished wide and was no factor.
INTERACTIF MOMENT raced within striking distance, made a bid and faded. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU dueled on the front end and faded down the home

Footnotes
SIMPLY WICKED raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside, took command, racing five wide down the stretch and was kept to the task.
VODKA GIMLET unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the turn, made a wide rally and was a clear second at the wire. ORDER UP lacked early
speed, gained ground late, proved no match for the top two, but was just up for show. DON'T WAIT UP raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and
was outfinished for third. BIG CHOPPER dueled for the early lead, raced outside around the turn and faded. FIESTY FIST challenged on the front end and
was finished early. DEAL WITH HIM void of early speed and was never a factor. DANCIN WITH ANGELS flashed brief speed and dropped back. YUKIO
showed early speed, saved ground around the turn and stopped.

followed the winner to the wire. ROSEISALWAYSRITE lacked early speed, made a steady gain and proved no match for the top two. BRAVE OLLIE
pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and lacked a late kick. MAC LEGACY raced near the back in the early part, improved position, while
finishing wide and was no factor. LES AND MADGE raced within striking distance and faded. CHARMING KAT raced within contention, faded and finished
evenly. PRAYED FOR YOU void of early speed, raced outside around the turn and was never a threat. DOUBLE APPEAL raced in the middle of the pack,
dropped back, finished wide and was outrun. BONJOOR MADEMOISEL lacked early speed, was never close and eased to the wire.
