P R GIRLFRIEND gained a short lead inside rivals through the first turn, made the pace and opened the lead going to the far turn then was roused briefly
through upper stretch and held a comfortable margin to the wire. SMILIN JOSIE saved ground, rallied inside rivals through the far turn then could not get to
the winner while clearly best of the others. BEAUTIFUL JUDGE tracked the early pace three and four wide but weakened while holding third. MOTRAIN was
not a threat. SPENTALLONCC chased two to three wide and tired.

CANTWAITTOGRADUATE showed the most early speed to open a clear lead going to the turn racing off the inside, continued well in the lane under steady
handling and held safe. HOT ARTIE was along the inside and slowly closed but could not reach the winner. MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL tracked the winner three
wide and made a mild gain but was outfinished for the place. FORGERY lacked a solid rally three wide. GUMBO was not a serious threat four wide.
BREWSTER broke inward to bump with a rival and failed to threaten four wide. OTHER THAN THAT lunged then was bumped at the start as a rival came in
and trailed.

HUNK OF A HIT saved ground in behind the leaders early, angled out going up the backstretch to bid three wide going to the far turn, came four wide into
the lane and drew off under steady handling. PREFERRED PROSPECT made the pace out from the rail while pressed from his outside, could not go with
the winner in the lane but held position late. HE HAD A SECRET pressed the early leaders three to four wide and lacked a final closing run. EL
CENTENARIO was pulling through the first turn then was caught in a bit tight entering the second turn, moved out to stalk three or four wide and lacked a
final closing run. SOUL READY weakened three to four wide. MY TRUE REWARD followed the early pace three wide and tired.

RED RED WINE cleared the field in the opening furlong and opened a dominant lead through the turn then was under steady hand urging to hold the
margin. D'WILD MUFFIN was three and four wide in the turn to get nearest the winner and could only chase that one home. OUR PETUNIA nearest the
winner along the inside, weakened. LEIGHTON KENTUCKY failed to mount a bid three and four wide. HIGH COST OF LIVIN was not a threat. READY TO
CHARM was taken to the outside and back early and never threatened. FLAMING INDY weakened from four wide.

Footnotes
ROYAL OUTLAW dropped inside the dueling leaders going to the turn, bid along the rail into the lane then outgunned MIDNIGHT DRAMA to the wire.
MIDNIGHT DRAMA dueled on the lead outside BELIEVE IN PARTS then was packed a bit wide nearing the lane as that rival came off the inside, held well
but could not contain the winner late. BELIEVE IN PARTS dueled inside MIDNIGHT DRAMA then came off the inside nearing the lane to pack that rival
wide and weakened late. R VOO'S TABOO went two or three wide in the turn and could not produce the needed final run. RHETTROACTIVE lacked a rally
four wide. EMMETT CAT saved ground and was not a threat. LAST BITA GLITTER chased the leaders three to four wide and weakened. JUST WING IT
got out on the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
THAT'S ALL RIGHT made the pace on a short lead along the inside, kicked well clear in the far turn then held safe through the lane under steady urging.
MAGIC IN A HAT stalked the pace while angled three and four wide and made a mild gain late. AQUATICA rallied three and four wide in the far turn but
could not reach the top pair. LASTING INFLUENCE saved ground and lacked a final closing bid. ZIPPORAH dropped over to run about two wide towards
the back and improved position late. BACK INTHAT ACTION lacked a solid bid four wide. ULTRA CORDIAL tracked the winner's pace three wide and
weakened. PRUD AS PUNCH weakened three and four wide. PEARLE DE VEENE was always back. TOP OF THE PODIUM tired racing two and three
wide.
