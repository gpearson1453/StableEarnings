Footnotes
AINT HE TEMPTING away well, drifted out steadily in a solid debut. GOOD WAGON SA away cleanly and had a wide path, steady urged in a second best
effort. HARD TO KNOW came in and bumped rivals at the start, kept to task thereafter in a steady effort. KR ROCKET MAN broke out and had clear sailing
throughout, finished up evenly under a hand ride. INTERESTING EAGLE bumped and floated in at the start, steady hand ride and finished evenly
thereafter. FUTURE VERSION off slow and knocked into rival at the start, altered out midway and finished well. JIM HARDIE away cleanly, lugged in
steadily from eighth pole to sixteenth, lacked rally. STEWARDS INQUIURY INTO THE START, AFTER REVIEW, HARD TO KNOW WAS DISQUALIFED
AND PLACE SIXTH BEHIND FUTURE VISION FOR INTERFERRENCE AT THE START
