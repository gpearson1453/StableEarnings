pace two wide and swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. ROBBY'S RANSOM stalked the early pace and
made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out in the lane, held show award late on the inside. NOTEWORTHY chased the early pace and was three
wide on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive and had a belated rally to just miss the show award. LTL BEAR SALOON settled early and was three
wide by the quarter pole and had no rally.

Footnotes
SPOOKY ONE was rated along the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim on the front runner, made a bid in the lane and got up late to prove
best under a drive. DIXIE CANNONBALL set a pressured pace on the inside and shook clear leaving the turn but it proved to be not enough as he was
caught late. SOUL STORY was off a step slow, then reserved four wide early, was five wide by the quarter pole and had a belated rally. MY MAN
GEORGIO was settled early, made a inside move on the turn but flattened out late. WAR NOVEL pressed the early pace and made a four wide bid on the
turn but weakened in the drive. PAULINO pressed the early pace from between rivals and stopped.
