BOTTOM DECK took the lead between horses past the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and
was steadily handled through the lane. TOLLER pressured the pace past the seven sixteenths pole, contested the turn two deep at a close disadvantage on
the turn, but dropped back into the stretch and dueled for second. PAPA DON gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and finished evenly at the
outside flank of the runner-up. SECRET CAMELOT pressured the early pace inside, dropped back at the rail on the turn then flattened stride in the lane.
STORM TRAPPE hesitated at the break, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the turn near the rail. GABBYS BIG NOTION was not a factor.

MATH MAN MARCO dug in for a long contentious duel from the start, kept the edge at the rail on the turn, was met into the lane but dug in determinedly to
eke out the nod over the game effort of JEFFERSON NATIVE, who contested the pace from the start, dueled with a slim disadvantage two deep on the turn,
moved to even terms toward the head of the lane and dug in gamely to the finish, but came up a nod shy. ROCKET SOUND engaged in close early chase,
rounded the turn about the three path and raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. TALKING TEDDY was jostled sharply leaving the gate, gave
chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, eased outward into the lane then flattened late stretch. ZEP gave chase, rounded the
turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. BURR HILL BULLET broke in to make sharp contact with Talking Teddy then gave chase and rounded
the turn near the rail. JUST GETS BETTER broke outward to make sharp contact with Talking Teddy then raced well back mostly saving ground.

MIDNIGHT ACT settled off the rail early, closed toward contention three wide past the half mile pole, picked up the chase from the three eighths and raced
four wide on the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and inched clear nearing the wire. ISHIHARA stalked off the rail, took a slim lead between horses
leaving the three quarter pole but was met at the nine sixteenths, dueled at mostly even terms from that point, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn,
was caught mid-stretch but continued the duel for second. DIXIE DRAWL settled off the pace in the three and four paths, challenged toward the three
eighths pole and dueled to a slim brief lead midway on the far turn, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. OUTLIER rounded the first turn in the four
path, took the nod at the nine sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms from the seven sixteenths, raced close between horses on the far turn then flattened
later yards. HOBE SOUND set the early pace inside, dropped back past the five eighths pole, gave chase into the backstretch then flattened at the rail on
the far turn. RRACE DAY WARRIOR rated close to the early pace then faded on the second turn.

FLAT CAT stalked two deep then took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, drew clear toward the quarter
pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert through the lane. HEROIC DEED set the early pace inside, was caught at the seven sixteenths
pole, gave close chase through the backstretch but dropped back nearing the quarter, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened. REGHITTO saved
ground racing well back from early contention, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and came along for third mid-stretch.
CLEVER BOB settled off the pace in the two and three paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn.
