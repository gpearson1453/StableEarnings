Footnotes
MR LIGHTNING BOY stalked just off the pacesetter outside a rival racing through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid three deep into upper stretch
and wrested the advantage in time in a protracted drived. CACTUS JACK broke readily, dictated the pace between foes on a narrow advantage into the
turn, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly past midstretch but was collared late. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY tracked off the second flight outside a rival in
early stages, continued four wide into upper stretch but had late bid while continuing well enough to gain a share. POLLOCK was rated in early stages
dropping off the second flight while angling to the inside, tipped out racing into upper stretch but had no late response. CALL ME HANDSOME was urged
inside the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

JEOPARDY JAMES tipped out while between rated between foes racing through the backstretch, angled to the inside entering the turn readily advancing on
the leader to challenge that rival nearing upper stretch, quickly took over, then drew clear under firm hand urging. LUCA DREW THE ACE tracked the
leaders between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the turn to challenge near the quarter mile marker but proved
no match for the winner while proving clearly best of the others. HOPPING HENRY ducked out at the start, was urged to gain a clear advantage remaining
off the rail racing into the turn, dueled between into upper stretch and gave way nearing the furlong maker. DIAMOND STATE flashed brief pace between
foes but dropped back early. LOVIELEE proved no factor.

LOVIN LIVIN was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, continued under patient handling into the far turn, swung five wide entering
the lane, wrested command in late stages and drove clear. CSILLA, in touch three wide prompting the pace to the backstretch, edged forward to a clear
advantage on the far turn but proved no match when confronted by the winner. GRANDMARY angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders, saved
ground to the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. TIZ LOTTIE, urged between foes pressing the pace to the far turn, gave way into the
lane. ASPROPODIA tracked off the first flight outside foes to the backstretch, made brief progress to advance four wide into the far turn but flattened out in
the drive. AUBURN, urged inside foes pressing the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, gave way into the lane. PLATINUMCENTS stumbled
badly at the start and dropped out early.

Footnotes
TAP FIRST was urged pressing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, took over from that rival leaving the quarter pole and went
clear under strong encouragement. THAT'S MY BOI TOY tracked off the first flight between foes, continued three wide into the lane and edged a rival for
the place honors nearing the wire. SWILL MERCHANT, urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch, dueled for command on the turn
to upper stretch and gave way late. STONE AGE tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no late kick. STUN
GUN broke readily, was eased off the leaders between foes under rating, continued between foes in the last flight into the turn, tipped four wide in upper
stretch and continued with interest to improve position. THEJIGISUP tracked the leaders between foes in second flight and faded into upper stretch. AGENT
MULGANNON broke slowly while being steadied out of tight quarters at the start and never gained contention. BETTINGONADREAM settled outside foes
racing to the turn and proved no threat. CHEF MENTEUR was a brief factor four wide in second flight but gave way racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
INFLUENCING, reserved last outside a rival in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the far turn, came through inside foes to challenge inside
the pacesetter leaving midstretch and wrested the advantage in time under strong handling. AFRAID NOT, urged setting the pace on a narrow advantage
along the inside, tipped off the rail entering the stretch while dictating terms to late stages but was collared nearing the wire. PUBLIC SERVICE was rated
three wide in second flight to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but proved no match for the top two. MAJESTIC UNION settled
between foes early, dropped out last nearing the far turn, saved ground to the lane and continued with interest to improve position inside foes late.
LIFENHOWULIVIT was rated inside foes in early stages, made brief progress gaining position nearing the lane but proved empty in the drive. CAPTURE
MY DREAMS, urged to a forward placing racing to the backstretch, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and had no closing bid. SONG OF THE
HEART, urged between foes prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way into the lane.

SASSY BEAST was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command through the turn, then edged clear late under firm
handling. LADY JEAN angled inwards prompting a rival's pace, pressed the issue through the turn past the furlong marker but proved no match late. TEXAS
REWARD was rated outside foes, advanced four wide on the turn into upper stretch and finished willingly to edge a rival for a share. EDIE MEENY MINY
MO tracked off the first flight inside foes into the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final bid. SPECIAL PRINCESS, steadied out
of tight quarters in early stages, dropped well back in the opening quarter and failed to menace thereafter. PLATINUM GEM was rated between foes
tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn but faded into upper stretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF SPECIAL PRINCESS LODGED
CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER SOF SASSY BEAST AND TEXAS REWARD BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
NY BETH GETSITDONE broke sharply, angled inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, held sway into upper stretch and was kept to
steady pressure. CATCH THE RAINBOW, bumped at the start, then held up last in the opening stages, commenced a steady, four wide advance racing into
the turn, then continued in that path through the stretch to prevail for the place honors late. TAP SOLO tracked off the first flight between foes in early
stages, shifted out to race three wide between foes into the lane but was outkicked for second. FABULOUS PHILLY angled inwards while being urged
prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, then faded into upper stretch. THATS ALL SHEWROTE angled to the inside pursuing the
leaders into the turn and faded into upper stretch. LOOKING FOR LOVE, bumped from both sides at the start, steadied out of tight quarters racing past the
nine sixteenths marker and never gained contention. TETON THAI angled to the inside tracking behind the second flight into the turn but offered no rally.
BRINGTHEWINE ducked in at the start losing position to the field and never menaced thereafter. CRYSTAL STEPS made brief pursuit of the leaders three
wide into the turn but gave way early. SPANISH EXCHANGE soon retreated.
