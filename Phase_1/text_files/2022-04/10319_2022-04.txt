Footnotes
REDLINE vied between rivals for command early, dueled with PRECEDENT around the turn, inched ahead in upper stretch, drew clear past the eighth pole
and held safely. CURLY ESA away quickly then was well placed stalking the top trio from outside, traveled four wide round the turn, rallied in the lane but
lacked the needed late punch. ARREST took up early and angled down to the inside, took an awkward step crossing back onto the turf early, pulled the rider
along and had to steady nearing the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground around the turn, tipped out in the lane and gained the show. PRECEDENT sped to
the front from inside and vied with rivals up the backstretch, dueled with REDLINE around the turn and into the stretch, then weakened in the final furlong.
POLLO D'ORO pressed the pace three deep early, chased the top pair three wide around the turn and flattened in the lane. TENSAS FREEDOM broke
slow from outside, trailed five then four wide on the turn and could not rally. AWESOME RHYTHM settled into a stalking position, started to run up on heels
and steadied near the nine-sixteenths pole, chased two wide then a bit off the rail into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
GERLACH'S chased off the inside, bid four wide into the stretch, kicked clear approaching the eight pole under hand urging and won going away while in
hand nearing the wire. WESTON showed brief speed inside the top pair then chased those rivals past the half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn and
finished willingly along the fence to gain the place. MCWHERTER vied for the lead three deep then dueled outside EXCESSIVE CAT, bumped that rival at
the half-mile pole, dueled in the three path around the bend, disposed of inner rival at the top of the stretch but was soon overtaken by the winner and
flattened to third. ACTIVE ACCOUNT sat off the pace, rounded the turn between rivals and got up for a minor award. EXCESSIVE CAT bobbled leaving the
gate but still came away quickly, vied between rivals then dueled with MCWHERTER, got bumped by that rival at the half-mile pole, fought two wide around
the bend and weakened in the lane. MUAY THAI (IRE) stumbled badly leaving the gate, went three deep around the turn and never threatened. FURY KAP
reared up in the gate, broke out a bit, took hold when running up on heels from the half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths marker, saved ground to the
stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN HORSE (ARG) sat off the pace early on, raced in the two path into the turn, swung out leaving the bend and further out at the top of the lane,
rallied to the front in upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong remaining and stayed strong under hand urging. PRODIGAL SON trailed along the inside into
the turn, saved ground through the lane, steered out in the stretch and rallied for the place. ULTIMATE BANGO stalked the pace on the inside, tipped out
entering the stretch, brushed with LOVE MY JIMMY at the top of the lane while putting in a bid, got bumped by IAN GLASS outside the eighth pole,
continued on through the final furlong and got edged for the place honors. IAN GLASS was off a bit slow from inside, angled off the rail and moved up to
chase in range outside a rival, bid three then four wide with a quarter mile left to run, drifted in and bumped rival in upper stretch and faltered to fourth.
SILARDI took control early with company alongside, took an awkward step early on the turn, vied along the rail to the stretch, lost command in upper stretch
and flattened late. LOVE MY JIMMY prompted the pace from outside, dueled two then three wide on the turn, brushed with inner rival while crowded at the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened after.

Footnotes
MO CONNELLY chased three then four wide around the first turn, traveled widest up the backstretch, angled in some around the second bend and took aim
three wide entering the stretch, bid three deep at the sixteenth pole and got up late. ARDIS controlled the pace on the inside, led clear through the far turn
and into the stretch, challenged with a sixteenth remaining, drifted out and bumped HARDDIANE late and was overtaken in the closing moments.
HARDDIANE chased outside a rival then between foes, took aim two wide into the stretch, bid between runners with sixteenth remaining, then was forced to
check when put in tight and bumped by ARDIS nearing the wire. STARSHIP DIPLOMACY rated in the two path early on, continued close up a bit further off
the rail in the middle stages, asked two then three wide on the far turn and weakened. TALKINGNONSTOP bobbled a bit at the start, lagged behind early,
raced two wide into the far turn, angled out leaving the bend and top of the stretch and passed tired rivals. JUSTHAPPENLIKETHAT chased along the
inside, coaxed up the backstretch, lost ground around the far turn and tired. ADMIRAL AESCHBACH forwardly placed three wide around the clubhouse
turn, traveled four deep up the backstretch, started to weaken with a quarter mile left to run, tired in the lane and was eased across the wire and walked off.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED ARDIS FROM SECOND TO THIRD FOR DRIFTING OUT INTO THE PATH OF
HARDDIANE WHICH COST HER THE CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
KANT BEAT THE ROCK got forced in and bumped inner rival at the start, stalked the pace off the rail, traveled two wide on the turn, steered out into the
stretch, drew alongside the runner-up with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. DONT CROSS EL HEFE forwardly placed in the beginning from outside,
bid three deep late on the turn, took over in upper stretch, moved clear approaching the eighth pole and yielded to the winner past the sixteenth pole. MO
THEM DOWN broke inward then challenged for command three deep, dueled outside BEN'S A GOALIE through the turn, took a short lead exiting the turn,
lost command in upper stretch and stayed on to hold third. RING GENERAL showed early speed from inside, could not keep pace with the top pair and
chased past the half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn, then moved out in the lane but failed to produce the needed late kick. KID STOLE A KISS
bobbled a bit leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and failed to menace. BEN'S A GOALIE got bumped leaving the
gate, went up to challenge for command between runners, took a bad step crossing back onto the turf course, dueled on the inside into and around the
bend, then gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
CHROME OF OUR OWN was off slow to begin, traveled along the inside at the back into the turn, eased off the rai land came three wide into the stretch,
steered out further in the drive and closed fast to overhaul the runner-up. LILA AT THE BEACH set the pace from inside while under pressure, maintained a
short lead through the turn, cleared in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth and got run down late by the winner. BACK ON THE STREET attended the
pace three deep, continued in the three path through the turn, chased within range through the lane but never found the needed late punch. KEEP YOUR
COIL pressed the pace from between rivals into and around the turn, lost touch with the top pair past the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. BEST OF
SHOW away well from outside then dropped back, raced outside a rival around the turn, angled in entering the stretch and found the rail but never
threatened. FULL SPEED ASTERN chased the top trio from inside around the turn, angled out at the three-sixteenths pole and failed to rally.

SELF ISOLATION sped clear and took control of the rail, set all the pace to the stretch while confidently ridden, urged a few times right-handed in the lane
and remained clear while coasting in late. VIVACIOUS VANESSA was hard to ride early along the inside, chased two wide into the far turn, angled out in the
lane and rallied for the place. BIG CLARE was caught four wide into the first turn then moved to the three path, traveled in mid-pack early then moved closer
up the backstretch, driven three wide into the lane and got edged for the place honors. CLEARLY GONE steadied behind rival into the first turn, lacked room
on the far turn then tipped two wide past the five-sixteenths pole, swung out into the stretch and summoned a mild rally. NORTHERN GEM pulled early and
went three wide around the first turn, crept closer outside a rival in the middle stages, was closest in pursuit two wide into the lane and flattened out.
WARRIOR'S MOON was off a bit slow to begin, was rank and checked early, traveled near the back off the inside, roused three wide on the far turn, tipped
out at the top of the stretch and lacked a bid. SMITTEN BY KITTEN stalked in the two path around the first turn, raced along the rail under asking while
dropping back on the far turn and tired down the lane. BOSSY SOUL tucked inside at the back on the first turn, saved ground trailing the field and never got
involved.

Footnotes
ROSE MADDOX stumbled a bit leaving the gate, dropped back early then crept closer up the backstretch, tried to angled out but was hemmed in by rival
and lacked room behind the top pair on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and drove past in the final sixteenth. ALL DIALED IN broke out a bit, chased
inside at the back of the pack, angled out around the turn and came five into the stretch, closed widest in the lane but could not get by the winner. RACE
JUDICATA pressed the pace from inside, dueled around the turn, fought gamely to the sixteenth pole and yielded late. SHANGHAI SUNRISE stalked the
pace from off the rail, bid three deep with five-sixteenths remaining, held a short lead into the furlong grounds but faltered in deep stretch. LUXURY LINER
tracked widest up the backstretch, rounded the turn four wide and flattened in the lane. PRAY FOR MY OWNER set the pace under pressure from the
inside, vied between foes on the turn and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AVENTAPP dueled for command outside PHOENIX TEARS, cleared foe at the three-eighths pole and angled to the rail, put to right-handed urging in the
lane and drew away. TWIRLING GRACE showed speed from inside, got crowded by PHOENIX TEARS and took back early and angled off the inside,
chased two wide then along the rail into the stretch, steered out in the lane and finished willingly to prove second best. SENSIBLE MOVE sat off the pace,
traveled two wide through the turn, moved out in the lane and gained the show. PHOENIX TEARS dueled for command from inside AVENTAPP up the
backstretch, got put in tight by that rival and shuffled back into the turn, switch out and chased two wide around the bend and weakened to a minor award.
KITTEN CALLS broke slow and came in at the start, checked hard behind BOSSY PEGASUS crossing the dirt, entered the turn along the rail, angled out
and came three wide into the drive and could not rally. MISS MENSA broke slow and veered in leaving the gate, raced greenly crossing surfaces early, gave
the rider a bit of trouble entering the turn, remained inside and cut the corner into the stretch and failed to rally. BOSSY PEGASUS broke a step slow,
shifted out crossing surfaces early, dropped back, saved ground through the turn and had little left for the drive.
