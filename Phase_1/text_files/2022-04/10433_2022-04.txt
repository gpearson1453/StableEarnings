Footnotes
MAY BEAU was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the far turn commencing a steady advance, moved to challenge
inside the pacesetter nearing the furlong marker and prevailed under firm handling. KATY AND EMMA was urged setting the pace a bit off the rail on a
narrow advantage racing to the backstretch, turned back a rival's challenge leaving the far turn, resisted the winner when challenged midstretch but proved
no match late. LADY MANHATTAN, off slowly, was settled outside foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance three deep racing into the far turn but
lacked the needed final response. THAWED, forwardly placed prompting a rival's pace in the opening half, moved to press that rival racing into the far turn
but flattened out in upper stretch. LEFT OF CENTER tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. DURA
THE EXPLORER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half. DARN TOOTIN soon trailed.

Footnotes
TONE ELISE broke readily, joined the pace four wide racing through the backstretch, dueled for command outside a rival racing through the turn to upper
stretch and edged clear late under firm handling. SWEETS MAKER, bumped at the start, quickly recovered, then was urged inside foes disputing the pace
on the backstretch, lost some ground to the leaders entering the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for
the place honors late. BELLE OF THE BALL, in touch with the first flight three wide between foes attending the pace in the opening stages, was urged to
duel for command inside the winner racing into the turn, pressed the issue into upper stretch but proved no match late. GINGER SPARKLE settled outside
foes in the last flight on the backstretch, then continued evenly four wide into the stretch. KAZACHAN, urged between foes disputing the pace in the opening
quarter, gave way racing into the turn. AMARETTO DI AMORE broke out bumped SWEETS MAKER, tracked off the leaders along the inside and faded
early. TIPHARAH, crowded between rivals at the start, emptied out after a half.

Footnotes
BAM BAM WARRIOR, in touch with the first flight between foes attending the pace under light reserve from the outset to the far turn, dueled for command
between into upper stretch, then turned back a challenge from MACHINEGUNPREACHER to edge clear under firm encouragement. STRATFORD raced
three deep between foes off the first flight in the opening stages, drifted out entering the first turn making repeated contact with MACHINEGUNPREACHER
midway through that bend, tracked outside rivals off the first flight to the far turn, was fanned five wide entering the lane and continued willingly to close the
gap late. MACHINEGUNPREACHER, caught four wide between foes racing to the first turn, was bumped while carried out a bit by STRATFORD racing
through the bend, was prompted to a position just outside the leaders stalking those foes three deep racing into the second bend, was urged to challenge for
command racing into upper stretch briefly gaining terms with the eventual winner midstretch but flattened out late. CALZONE, forwardly placed three wide
tracking just off the leaders racing to the first turn, was eased off the pace to track the leaders between foes on the backstretch, then continued with a
second effort between foes to regain some position late. PROCURADOR tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, shifted out four wide
entering the lane but quickly came up empty in the drive. BALLINDERRY tracked the pace between foes in second flight racing to the first turn but retreated
early. LAGERFELDT broke sharply, was urged along the inside disputing the pace to the far turn, then gave way into the lane. JUPITER RAIN, caught five
wide racing into the first turn, dropped out early. FORT WILLIAM bobbled at the start, settled last near the inside and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHRISTMAS PRESENT, reserved between foes in the last flight racing through the backstretch, gained position between foes entering the bend, shifted out
three wide nearing upper stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement.
NANTUCKETER, forwardly placed between rivals tracking just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, moved to press the issue racing into the turn, dueled
for command inside a rival nearing upper stretch, edged forward midstretch but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. MIAMI CHROME tracked just off the
pacesetter three deep in the opening stages, advanced in that path to press the issue racing into the turn, dueled for command outside a rival into upper
stretch and gave way between rivals leaving the furlong marker. CHROME FINISH broke awkwardly, angled to the inside on the backstretch steadily gaining
some position, was held up momentarily when caught in some traffic entering the turn, tipped off the inside midway through the bend but lacked the needed
late response. TINKER'S PAL tracked off the first flight four wide racing to the turn, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders entering the bend and steadily
faded nearing the lane. LIL BULL raced between foes in the last flight in the opening quarter but dropped out early. ACTION WARRIOR trailed the field to
the stretch. WHISKEY PLANK was urged to gain the lead racing past the chute, dictated the pace a a bit off the rail on the backstretch, dueled for command
inside foes racing into the turn and gave way abruptly on the bend.

Footnotes
MONETIZED, very reluctant to load, broke in crossing over the path of DISTORTED TIMES while making some contact with MONITOR MILLS, raced in
touch with that foe between rivals in the first flight to the backstretch, was prompted to go clear racing into the far turn, opened a commanding advantage
nearing upper stretch and just maintained the advantage to the end under brisk handling. SHIPWRECK, reserved shifting well off the inside racing to the
backstretch, was prompted to advance three, then four wide through the far turn to upper stretch and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner
nearing the wire. MEAN JOE BRO, bumped by THE SKIPSTER at the start, angled in tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, came around a
tiring foe on the far turn and continued along the inside to gain some position while prevailing for a share. THE SKIPSTER broke inwards bumping MEAN
JOE BRO, was urged to terms with the leaders three deep racing to the backstretch, continued in that path between foes into the far turn, lost ground to the
leader on the second bend and emptied out into the stretch. DISTORTED TIMES, shut off at the start, settled last to the backstretch, swung out four wide
racing into the stretch and made some belated progress. JOHNNIE GOT JETS urged along four wide into the first turn, moved to terms with the first flight
midway through the backstretch, but soon gave way racing into the far turn. MONITOR MILLS, bumped at the start, recovered quickly, was urged to the lead
inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, but gave way abruptly once headed by the winner racing into the far turn.
AGENT MULGANNON ducked out at the start while getting away slowly, was settled outside foes and failed to menace. REGAL EAGLE dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHE DAZZLE was rated outside rivals in the second flight while racing in the four path to the turn, was prompted to advance in that path nearing upper
stretch to challenge for command entering the lane, then kicked away in the closing stages under firm handling and some right handed pressure. KITTY
KITTY angled to the inside in early stages while being prompted in pursuit of the leaders racing to the turn, came through along the rail to bid inside the
pacesetter racing into upper stretch, but couldn't match the winner late while edging a rival for the place honors. PRINCESS LIVIA, urged inside foes
through the backstretch disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, edged forward to a clear advantage on the turn while shifting a bit off the rail, dueled
between the top pair to midstretch but yielded late. CAJUN SPICE was rated off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside
entering the turn but lacked the needed closing response. VILLAGE QUEEN settled last racing five wide through the backstretch and never gained
contention. SWEET PENELOPE, urged between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. SILVER
TUNES broke readily, raced in touch with the first flight three deep prompting the pace into the turn, then gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH, reserved inside off the second flight along the inside in the opening half, saved ground on the far turn steadily gaining position,
shifted out three wide in upper stretch to split foes, then wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. GREAT BRITAIN broke readily,
shifted inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival, then between foes through the backstretch, dueled for command into the stretch, couldn't match the
winner's bid but proved best of the others. SIR SAFFER was rated in the opening stages while angling to the inside to track off the first flight, shifted out
three wide nearing upper stretch, continued four wide into the lane, couldn't match the top pair but continued well enough to edge rivals for a share. MY
WAY OR NO WAY was settled outside the eventual winner racing to the backstretch, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued evenly
between foes late. SHED A TEAR, urged to the lead along the inside in the opening stages, pressed the pace inside foes through the backstretch to upper
stretch and gave way late. PANADERO settled last along the inside for five furlongs, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but made no impression.
ARTIE'S ANGEL exchanged bumps with PHARAOH'S PROPHECY after the opening furlong, was prompted to gain a forward placing three deep racing just
off the first flight to the backstretch but gave way racing into the far turn. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY exchanged bumps racing three deep between foes in
the opening stages, tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight and gave way abruptly after a half.

Footnotes
SPANISH DELIGHT, in touch with the leaders five wide between foes in the opening furlong, shifted inwards a bit to prompt the pace three wide racing into
the turn, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, then responded to firm handling to kick away from the field through the stretch to prove best.
QUEEN'S BEST settled off the second flight while switching out to the three path on the backstretch, angled to the rail racing past the quarter mile marker
and continued with interest along the rail to edge rivals for the place honors late. TWIN BRIDGES was rated off the first flight outside foes in the opening
quarter, was urged in pursuit of the eventual winner four wide racing into the turn, continued in that path into upper stretch but weakened late while
prevailing for a share. SASSY CAT exchanged brushes at the break, was rated between foes dropping off the second flight nearing the turn, swung out four
wide racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to gain some position. WATER WIZARD tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening
stages, tipped outside some tiring foes racing through the turn but offered no rally. LUSCIOUS, urged inside foes disputing the pace through the
backstretch, gave way into the lane. FOXY AUSTIN was urged between foes pressing the pace into the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. V K
PRINCESS was outpaced early.

ROBINSON, reserved while angling to the inside on the chute tracking behind the second flight, continued along the inside into the far turn, shifted out four
wide racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance, took over leaving midstretch and went clear under pressure. EIGHT WEEKS LONG,
reserved along the inside in the last flight racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide entering the stretch and continued with interest between foes to
prevail for the place honors late. JO JO KATZ settled last in early stages, swung out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance, was
fanned six wide into the stretch but continued willingly to edge rivals for a share. VINTNER tracked the pacesetter inside foes in second flight, saved ground
on the far turn, tipped off the inside to split rivals in the two path midstretch but lacked the needed final kick. LION CHARMER, forwardly placed three deep
tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight, advanced in that path to lodge a brief bid entering the lane but came up empty midstretch.
GOLOVKIN angled inwards racing to the first turn to track the pacesetter between foes in second flight, was urged to challenge between rivals nearing
upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. CLEMSON TIGER sprinted to the lead while angling to the rail racing through the chute, held sway on a clear
margin into the far turn, dueled inside foes to midstretch and gave out. IN HONOR OF ARTIE settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never
gained contention. OSPREY faded between foes early. BRIDGEKEEPER, caught three deep, then four wide after a half tracking the pacesetter in second
flight, gave way racing into the far turn.
