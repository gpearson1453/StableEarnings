Footnotes
HEAVENLY RHYTHM was unhurried in the early stages, made a good advance through the far turn, angled five to six wide through the upper lane and
finished strongly to be well clear in the final stages under steady handling. ZARELDA was slow early, angled widest through the stretch run and made a
good late rally. BOERNE showed good early foot from the outside to set the early pace while racing four deep down the backstretch, raced near the inside
through the upper lane to challenge for the lead an weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. TAKE CHARGE WOMAN was forwardly placed to lay up close
in the early stages along the inside, raced four wide through the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. IT'S MY MONEY stalked the pace, raced
along the inside near the quarter pole through the stretch and had no final winning bid. SHES OUR FASTEST stalked the pace while racing between rivals
down the backstretch and weakened in the lane. ITS MY MONEY TOO settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no
response. LADY AVE stalked the pace early on, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor. IMA DISCREET LADY was
forwardly placed early and faded while racing four wide.

to five wide through the stretch run and had not enough for the top pair. J M SKY CLASSIC showed good early speed from the inside and weakened the
final eighth of a mile. NOT THIS LUNA stalked the pace along the inside and tired.

BEYOND HELLO was hustled along early to show good early speed and drew off to be well clear while racing under steady pressure. MESABI settled off
the early pace, raced five wide around the far turn and was no match for the winner in the drive. GOLDEN QUALITY settled off the early pace, raced along
the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough for the top pair. DARE TO FAIL dropped back early on, raced three to four wide in the
drive and showed good late interest. DARE TO BE WILD was allowed to settle early, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally.
SECRET HOLIDAY showed good early speed and tired while racing two to three wide. SHARP DOUBLE EDGE stalked the pace from the outside and tired
while racing four wide. UPTOWN BIGBADJON raced three deep and had no response. TWIST OF FATE saved ground and never threatened.
