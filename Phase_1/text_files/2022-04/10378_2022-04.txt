Footnotes
DUSTY BOY unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the final turn, made a late bid, dueled down the lane and was up late, racing between rivals.
HIGH RIDGE raced within striking distance, made a bid around the second turn, took the lead at the head of the stretch, dueled to the wire and was
outfinished for the win. SIR POKERFACE void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made an outside bid, dueled and was
outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. MY GUITAR lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. THE THREE KS went to the front, drove
clear and faded. SEMI CHARMED LIFE pressed the early pace and was finished early. MY BOOK raced within contention, came around the first turn on the
outside and dropped back.

RIVETRIX sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. APHRODITES REVENGE raced within contention, saved ground
around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, made a bid, couldn't catch RIVETRIX, but was best of rest. SHANGHAI HETTY pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH raced in the middle of the field, moved up, within contention, lacked a
late kick and was caught for third. MY REBEL GIRL lacked early speed, moved up and finished evenly. SWIMHARD DREAMBIG raced near the middle of
the field, faded and was no threat late. MISSGREELEY'SSONG always raced near the back and showed little. GOLDEN EXPRESSO lacked early speed
and was outrun.

KATIE'S KARAT unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, got through on the rail and pulled away down the stretch. COCKTAILS AT

and was outfinished for second. ROARING QUINN pressed the pace, saved ground and lacked a late kick. US SECOND CUTE PIE lacked early speed and
was never a factor. KAPPA HILL raced evenly near the back and showed little. REMI'S ROSE raced within contention and made a steady retreat.

weakened and finished evenly. UNBRIDLED PULPIT raced near the back, finished wide and passed tired ones. FAR OUT TIME raced within contention,
faded and was no threat late. BITSY'S OTHER HALF raced within striking distance, came around the first turn on the outside and dropped back. MISTA

throughout, raced outside around the turn, proved no match for the top two, but held on for show. LOUISIANA HERO lacked early speed, raced outside

Footnotes
BOLD DANCER vied for the early advantage, raced outside around the turn, drove clear and finished well. MR. E EDWARDS had an awkward start, racing
in the back, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and got up for second. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR dueled on the front end,
forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. MULETRAIN raced evenly near the back in the beginning, made a late bid, but was no real
threat. CORN SOUP raced within contention, weakened and lacked a late kick. ETBAUER'S SECRET raced within striking distance, faded and was no
threat late. PAC THE PULPIT raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. YANKEE HAIL CAT raced in the middle of the pack and faded.
LUCKLY GOLD raced within contention and retreated. DATE void of early speed and showed little. AW HECK always raced near the back and was outrun.
