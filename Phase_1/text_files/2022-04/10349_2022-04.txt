MARCELO away cleanly, leveled quickly, responded strong to urging and drew off to win impressively. CHICKS FIRST FLASH away well, steady urged
throughout, drifted in a path late under a drive. DON LAZARO away well, steady urged the first half of the race, maintained a straight course while under a
hand ride late. WAVING THE WAY broke in and bumped rival at the start, in tight the first hundred yards, rider hand urged throughout in a solid debut. JUST
ONE broke in and lightly brushed rival at the start, asked once early and finished evenly under a hand ride while maintaining a straight course. SMOKIN
HOT FIRE bumped on hind end at the start, steady urged early on, and weaved in and out late due to the lights. MAD TOOL off one length slow, leveled
quickly and asked, failed to make up any ground under urging. KARMAVORE broke in two paths at the start, rider had a tough time as horse was green
being close to the rail and never asked.
