Footnotes
MYSTIC NIGHT rated comfortably off of the pace in the two path, picked up stride in the four path around the far turn, ranged up turning for home to loom a
danger outside of the leader in upper stretch, assumed command at the furlong grounds, inched away, and was wrapped up through the late stages.
MISCHIEF AFOOT trailed around the first turn, launched a rally while shifting out to the five path and outside of MYSTIC NIGHT turning for home, followed
that rival's rally through midstretch to bid for place outside of MAJOR FED approaching the final sixteenth, dueled with that foe through the closing stages,
and prevailed. MAJOR FED tracked in midpack in the two path, got outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home while waiting behind traffic, shifted
four wide with a few lengths to find in upper stretch, rallied inside of MISCHIEF AFOOT to bid for place with that foe entering the final sixteenth, battled with
that rival to the wire, but got outfinished. WAR STOPPER stalked along the inside, pursued the clear leader under urging around the far turn, got outkicked
by the eventual winner entering the lane, sustained his rail chase thereafter to attempt a bid for place approaching the final sixteenth, but was surpassed by
a pair of outer rivals in the process. CONCERT TOUR set a clear pace while loping along in hand and a bit off of the inner railing, showed the way
unencumbered around the far turn, met MYSTIC NIGHT's challenge in upper stretch, proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and
weakened between horses shortly after. FARMINGTON ROAD stalked outside of the leader while in the four to three paths around the turns, gave chase
around the far bend but faded approaching the lane. BEAVER HAT took the turns in the three path while midpack, and faded turning for home.
ENFORCEABLE laid off of the pace in the three path, but was through after five furlongs.

Footnotes
RUTHIN (GB) set the pace in the three path, shrugged off an outer presser entering the lane before meeting her stable-mate's rail challenge passing the
three sixteenths pole, dueled gamely through midstretch to repel that foe's bid entering the final sixteenth, inched clear in the late stages, and just lasted
from an oncharging outer foe to the wire. DERRYNANE settled off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide approaching the furlong grounds, split foes with a
stout kick leaving that station, surged in the late stages, but just missed reaching RUTHIN (GB) on the wire. HER WORLD (IRE) stalked along the inside
while a path off of the rail around the turn, smoothly bid for the lead inside of her leading stable-mate in upper stretch, sparred entering the final furlong, but
was turned away entering the final sixteenth, and flattened out. LOST MY SOCK tracked in the three path around the turn, chased from behind the leading
group through upper stretch, bid for show inside of a tiring GUN BOAT at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked for that position shortly after, then kept on
to threaten show again late. UNBRIDLED MARY lacked early speed, was urged along under steady coaxing four wide around the turn while in midpack,
chased five wide while one-paced through midstretch, and failed to bid. GUN BOAT pressed the leader from the outside while in the four path around the
turn, but failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, then tired between horses in the final sixteeenth. SIN CITY GAL broke a step slowly, trailed
around the turn, and never got involved. THUNDER LOVE (GB) brushed the inner part of the gate at the start, saved ground in midpack around the turn, but
faded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TIZ SPLENDID NEWS set a clear pace around the turn, shifted to the three path entering the lane, inched further away in upper stretch, but tired in the final
furlong as HONORIFIQUE gave chase, and just lasted from that foe to the wire. HONORIFIQUE broke a bit slowly and raced off of the pace early on,
gained four wide around the turn, claimed place entering the lane before taking aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, failed to progress in midstretch, but
began to narrow that tiring foe's advantage in the final furlong, grinded away to produce a late bid, but did not have enough to reel that rival in. LIBERTY M
D laid off of the pace three wide and between horses around the turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, gained show while between horses in upper stretch,
and stayed on while minorly progressing. REGAL RETORT got caught four wide around the turn while off of the pace, got floated six wide entering the lane,
and stayed on mildly outside of the leading trio. FRAUDULENT CHARGE took up when put to tight quarters between horses early on, trailed around the
turn, swung five wide entering the lane, and moved up. BEES AND HONEY lacked early speed, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses into the
turn, shifted three wide approaching the lane, then four wide in upper stretch, but failed to factor. ZAINALARAB tracked four wide, then three wide after the
three furlong pole, but was outmoved by an outer rival entering the lane while failing to pick up stride, and yielded thereafter. FARSIGHTED was reluctant to
load, tracked three to two wide and between horses into the turn, and tired. FRONT STREET stalked two wide, tucked to the rail at the three furlong pole,
but weakened entering the lane. WINWARD FLO stalked along the inside, but weakened into the turn and was done early.

SHIRL'S SPEIGHT rated off of the pace two wide, chased three wide around the far turn, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied outside of rivals
in the final furlong, surged to reel in MASEN (GB) in the closing stages, and prevailed via a tight photo finish. MASEN (GB) pressed the leader from the
outside while in the three path, ranged up to bid entering the lane, vied while getting herded to the five path in upper stretch, led entering the final furlong,
clung to a margin from his inner game counterpart into the final sixteenth, but met SHIRL'S SPEIGHT relentless challenge in the late stages, and got nailed
at the wire. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT set the pace inside of a pressing MASEN (GB) while a path off of the inside, shifted outwardly to the four path while
resisting that foe's bid in upper stretch, hung on his left lead while getting headed at the furlong pole, then battled on through the late stages, but was
bested. ATONE stalked along the inside, chased the leaders two wide and from between horses, got outkicked for show at the furlong grounds, but fended
off an outer rival for fourth to the wire. MIRA MISSION tracked two wide, chased under urging around the far turn before tipping three wide entering the lane,
but lacked a kick between horses in upper stretch. COUNT AGAIN trailed around both turns, then stayed on between horses late. SET PIECE (GB) raced
off of the pace in the four path, tugged forward down the backstretch to press the leading pair from the outside around the far turn, but failed to keep pace
passing the quarter pole, and tired between horses in the final furlong. IN LOVE (BRZ) saved ground off of the pace, chased along the rail through upper
stretch, but tired through the final furlong.

Footnotes
NAPA CANDY bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in midpack in the two path while under steady urging, tipped outside of the leading pair turning
for home, bid entering the lane, and drew off at the furlong grounds. VERONICA GREENE broke a step slowly and shied mildly from an inner foe at the
start, laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer outside of foes turning for home, but was brushed six wide in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place
approaching the final sixteenth, and secured that position. SUPER CHRISTIE stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading trio in upper stretch,
bumped an outer DONTGETABOVURAISIN in the process, then only produced a mild kick between horses. DONTGETABOVURAISIN bumped with an
inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path under mild urging, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but was bumped with an inner foe while
between horses at the three sixteenths pole, and got outkicked by those rivals for minor placings. SURCHARGE trailed along the inside around the turn,
gained along the rail through upper stretch, shifted outside of foes leaving the furlong grounds, and sustained his rally trough the late stages. OMA THE
GREAT saved ground off of the pace, but encountered mild traffic while in the three path in midstretch, and made little impact. REGAL REALM pressed the
pace two wide, vied between horses entering the lane, but yielded in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. JETINWITHCLASS broke a bit outwardly
and failed to factor. SIS BOOM BOB set the pace, vied inside of a pair of bidding foes entering the lane, but weakened in upper stretch. AN APPLE A DAY
failed to factor. JALEBI BABY never got involved. BE TOUGH chased three wide into the turn, but weakened between horses approaching the lane.
