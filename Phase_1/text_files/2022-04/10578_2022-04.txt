Footnotes
GRAND DIANA bobbled, then was brushed at the start, was righted to track just off rivals in second flight on the backstretch, tipped three wide racing into
the turn commencing a steady advance, bid for command in that path nearing upper stretch, then drew away through the lane while being kept to pressure.
MISSPOKEN tracked the pacesetter four deep in the opening stages, shifted inwards racing into the bend steadily gaining on the pacesetter, bid for
command in tandem with the winner nearing upper stretch but proved no match for that foe while clearly best of the others. BUNNY PRINCESS settled last
along the inside racing to the turn, tipped off the inside entering the stretch and continued to gain position between foes while earning a share. LYLA'S
MARK was rated just behind the second flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but offered no rally. THAWED broke
sharply, sprinted clear of the field near the inside racing to the turn and gave out abruptly racing into upper stretch. TIPHARAH dropped out early.

Footnotes
IDEAL BREEZE broke sharply, conceded the lead when headed by SWEET PENELOPE in the opening stages to stalk that rival under rating, steadily
moved to terms with that foe entering the turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, then kicked away through the stretch under one right handed tap and
hand urging to go well clear. SO MOXIE settled last along the inside racing to the turn, angled outside foes entering upper stretch and continued with
interest to narrowly prevail for the place honors late. GRAND MAMOO ducked out at the start crossing into the path of SWEET PENELOPE, was righted to
track that rival outside foes racing to the turn but had no closing bid. SWEET PENELOPE, carried out a bit at the start, was urged to gain a clear advantage
racing a bit off the inside to the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner on the bend and gave way into the stretch. PRETTY PRINCESS tracked the
pacesetter inside foes racing to the turn and faded nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
ASTERS D'ORO was urged along the rail dictating the pace on a narrow margin into the first turn, widened when given her cue racing through the far turn,
tipped off the inside in upper stretch but held sway on comfortable margin while being kept to pressure. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY angled to the inside
tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to advance and proved best of the others. FIRST
GOLD was urged prompting the pace outside the eventual winner from the outset to the second bend, then faded into the stretch. REYNA DE VERANO, off
last, was caught four wide racing through the first turn while being prompted to contention outside foes on the backstretch, then keept on three deep into the
lane while finishing evenly late. DOUBLE DOT, reserved between foes in the last flight early, never gained contention. MA COCO was settled inside foes in
early stages, switched outside rivals on the backstretch while being prompted to advance, was caught four wide nearing upper stretch and came up empty
entering the lane. TOURING EGYPT tracked the leaders three deep between foes racing to the first turn, angled to the inside after a half but soon gave
way.

Footnotes
AUBURN was urged between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards disputing the pace inside a rival in the second furlong, was held up avoiding tight
quarters racing past the nine sixteenths marker, tipped out on the turn to advance splitting rivals nearing upper stretch, tipped four wide in upper stretch,
then took over in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. PLATINUMCENTS threw her head at the start to lose some position at the
break, shifted out racing to the turn to bid for command three wide between foes after a half, edged away to a clear advantage into upper stretch but couldn't
fend off the winner. ASPROPODIA was settled along the inside in the opening quarter, switched out four wide nearing the turn to advance with a sharp
move between foes entering the bend to briefly loom outside the leaders, couldn't match terms with the top pair but kept on well enough to prevail for a
share. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE angled inwards forcing the pace outside the eventual winner shifting into that rival's path near the inside after three furlongs,
dueled for command inside foes racing into the turn and gave way leaving midstretch. PLAY THAT TONE was urged inside foes pursuing the leaders on the
backstretch, was held up behind the winner approaching the half mile marker, dropped out last entering the turn, then shifted out entering the stretch but
offered no rally. KISSMELIPS, forwardly placed just outside the leaders in early stages, was urged to lodge a brief bid between foes racing into the turn,
dueled to midstretch and gave way late. JUST LIKE INDY, restless in the gate prior to the start, ducked inwards at the break, was settled outside a rival,
then was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders five wide into the turn but was quickly spent.

Footnotes
COASTAL WATERS, reserved between foes in the last flight racing to the first turn, dropped out last after a half, swung outside foes on the far turn to race
five wide entering the lane but produced a stout rally to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling. STAMKOS, cut off at the start, was settled outside
foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards a bit nearing the second bend advancing to contention between foes, angled outside the
leaders in upper stretch to bid for command four wide between foes and continued gamely contesting the issue to the wire while just failing to contain the
winner. JO JO HANS tracked just outside rivals in the first flight under light rating to the backstretch, advanced to challenge for command three wide nearing
upper stretch, pressed the issue in that path past midstretch but weakened once headed by the top pair. AMBUSHED was urged dictating the pace between
foes on a narrow advantage in the opening half, dueled for command through the far turn into upper stretch and emptied out leaving the furlong marker.
JUSTICE WARRIOR, a bit restless in the post parade, switched off the inside while pulling hard between foes to gain terms with the pacesetter nearing the
backstretch, continued with a brief bid through the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. GHOST OF KHOZAN was rated along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE angled to the inside in early stages tracking
just off the pacesetter, moved to press the issue inside that rival after a half, dueled inside foes into the far turn and gave way midstretch. SHIPWRECK
ducked out at the start crossing over the path of STAMKOS, was settled while angling back to the inside racing to the backstretch and never proved a factor.

EL SAMURO was settled outside rivals dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out four wide racing past the six furlong marker,
steadily advanced on the leaders three wide on the far turn to upper stretch, then angled inside those foes leaving midstretch to narrowly prevail in time
under firm right handed encouragement. END ALL GET ALL was rated just off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, steadily gained terms
with the leaders between rivals racing into the far turn, edged forward setting the pace on a narrow advantage through the bend, contested the issue in a
prolonged drive off the inside past midstretch and just failed to contain the winner. SMART N INTUITIVE, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival in
the opening half, was urged pressing the issue outside END ALL GET ALL racing in the three path into upper stretch, continued with a grudging effort to late
stages but was just outfinished by the top pair. CURLIN'S THRILL, reserved off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, split foes racing
through the far turn to gain some position but offered no rally. CAUSALISTIC tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening half, briefly awaited an
opening switching outside a tiring rival on the far turn but faded in the drive. INDIAN BUZZ was urged setting the pace while angling inside racing to the
backstretch, then gave way racing into the far turn. CANDY COVE tracked just off the first flight three wide to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MACYS was rated outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, continued under patient handling approaching the far turn, was urged to
challenge for command three wide on the far turn, quickly moved away to a clear advantage nearing the lane, then was roused through the stretch to widen
the margin to the end. TEA'S DREAM angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, switched outside the pacesetter to bid
between foes entering the far turn, continued to pursue the eventual winner along the inside to the stretch but proved no match. OVERTHEBLUESKY was
rated off the second flight while shifting out three wide nearing the backstretch, came under prompting to advance racing into the far turn but lacked the
needed closing response while continuing well enough to earn a shar. REAL GOOD VYBZ was urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the opening,
shifted out to three path gaining a narrow advantage approaching the far turn, dueled between foes entering the second bend and gave way racing into
upper stretch. AMAZING MSKITTY, off last, was settled along the inside to the backstretch, angled outside rivals racing into upper stretch but made no
impression. COUNTESSOFLOVELACE, reserved well off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, came up empty racing into the far
turn. CANDIA was settled outside foes in the opening stages and proved no threat. TRACKER JACKER, urged along the rail disputing the pace, gave way
after a half. LOVINGTIZ tracked off the second flight outside foes to the backstretch and steadily retreated nearing the lane.

Footnotes
WINFROMWITHIN broke readily, attended the pace three wide on his own courage racing to the turn, was prompted to bid for command between rivals in
that path leaving midstretch, then wrested the advantage in time under firm left handed pressure to be taken in hand at the wire. GRAN RUNNER tracked
off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance in that path racing into upper stretch but came up
second best at the wire. R MERCEDES BOY, in touch prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch into the turn, drifted out entering upper stretch while
moving to gain a narrow advantage but yielded to the top pair late. BREWMEISTER was reserved outside foes in the last flight and made an effort to gain
some position four wide late. THEALLIGATORHUNTER, off a beat behind the leaders, was urged disputing the pace on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail
on the backstretch, pressed the issue inside foes to midstretch and gave way late. MYSTIC LINK angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of
striking distance racing into the turn but offered no rally. SELF TAUGHT switched out of close quarters in early stages, then angled to the inside nearing the
turn but never mounted a serious challenge.

Footnotes
BARBERINI, bumped at the start, was settled near the back while shifting outside foes entering the backstretch, advanced when called upon racing four
wide into the far turn, continued in that path into upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. VENEZUELAN TRIUMPH, reserved outside foes off
the second flight racing to the backstretch, made a sharp advance to join the pacesetter three deep entering the far turn, pressed the issue in that path to
gain a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch, drifted out entering the lane contesting the issue to late stages but couldn't contain the winner. GREAT
BRITAIN attended a rival's pace under firm rating in the opening half, took over racing into the far turn, resisted when challenged nearing upper stretch but
yielded to the top pair nearing the wire. AZURE SKY, reserved along the inside in the opening half, switched out to advance three wide nearing upper
stretch but had no closing bid. ARTIE'S ANGEL, cut off at the start, was settled last to the backstretch, then tipped out entering the stretch to make some
belated progress between foes. FAST PAYDAY veered in sharply at the start crossing over the path of ARTIE'S ANGEL while bumping the eventual winner,
was collected to track off the second flight along the inside, then switched out entering the stretch to pass some tiring rivals. PANORAMA TRUCK tracked
off the second flight outside foes in the opening half and faded racing through the far turn. ONE LUCKY DAY tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of
the second flight and gave way racing into the far turn. ORIGO, reserved three deep between foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide in upper stretch
and proved no threat. SHIMMERING LEROID tracked just off the first flight along the inside and gave way racing into the far turn. SIR SAFFER was urged
setting the pace on a narrow margin along the inside and gave way abruptly entering the far turn.
