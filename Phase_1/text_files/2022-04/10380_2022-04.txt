ARROWWOOD settled off the pace inside, took aim approaching the five sixteenths pole then rallied to the lead three wide midway on the far turn, ran clear
into the stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. KATALIMA saved early ground racing off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded
the far turn in the three and four paths, then closed for second inside the sixteenth pole. WALK A FINE LINE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole and put Bella Femmina away midway on the far turn, while at the same time gave up the lead to Arrowwood, then flattened
through the final sixteenth. CREATIVE SPLENDOR settled off the pace inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far
turn and showed little more. DIXIE SUNRISE settled off the rail on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little further. BELLA FEMMINA raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked two deep on
the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened.
