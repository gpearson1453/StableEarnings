Footnotes
MCTHANKS shifted in from five to two to three wide on the first turn, advanced inside foes commencing a bid three wide, drifted out a path late on the far
turn, engaged the leader to duel late and edged by to prevail. GORDY'S RULES set the pace under pressure racing off the rail, dueled in late stretch and
was outfinished. ARCH CITY raced forwardly three wide and between runners into the first turn, eased back off the leading pair and switched out, made a
five then six wide move on the far turn to reach striking distance but could not sustain the effort. LIL LATIGO was caught six wide into the first turn, moved in
a bit on that bend, trailed into the far turn, passed inside a tiring rival two to three wide but made no bids. SEXY DEXY vied four wide early then pressed
three wide, faltered and faded. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

FOLLOW THE FACTS set the pace racing off the inside, drifted out a bit into the stretch, just lasted. JAN'S RESERVE saved ground on or just off the rail,
rallied but just missed. CAIRO KING angled out from three to five wide leaving the turn, gained steadily but needed more and got up for show honors.
MORO APPEAL chased the winner four to five wide, weakened. GLOBAL EXCHANGE bobbled just slightly at the start, shifted out heading up the
backstretch chasing the leading pair, went five then six wide on the turn and evened out. TAINO HOUSE failed to menace after going three wide on the turn.
PULPITS FOX was in a bit tight at the start, went four to five wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
TRACK BOUND prompted the early pace two wide, moved clear heading to the backstretch still racing off the rail, held well under steady handling. LUCK IN
MY EYES settled mid-pack two wide off the early leaders, advanced heading to the far turn, shifted in past the three-sixteenths, was second best.
WATFORD raced four wide and ran on for show honors. SMOKEN HOUDINI was brushed at the start, shifted in racing three wide into the first turn well
back of the leaders, continued three wide on the far turn and improved position. MARILYN MONEYROLL brushed a rival at the start, was
forwardly-positioned three wide into the first turn, eased back off the leading pair stalking, was still within striking distance three deep on the far turn but
weakened in the stretch. BOB'SALLWICKED saved ground inside on the first turn, moved out a path to advance past a rival on the far turn, was never near
enough to threaten. COMING ABSTRACTION went four wide on the turns and was not a factor. ZENFULLY ZESTY showed brief speed inside, steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
HOLLAND was encouraged forward inside to contend for the lead, vied inside rivals on or just off the rail, moved clear into upper stretch and drifted a bit but
held well. SECRET'S DOUBLE vied two to three wide between rivals, drifted four wide into the stretch, held second. MIDNIGHT SPLIT contended three to
four wide outside foes into the turn, floated five deep out of that bend, missed the place. BABO STORM settled off the early pace, saved ground on or just
off the rail, gained late. SILVERBULLITBADGER tracked mid-pack going two to three wide on the turn and ran on evenly. MY NOAH chased outside, moved
out from three to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. BINGOS SYSTEM failed to threaten. DADDY HEAT failed to menace after moving out from four to six
wide on the turn. DRISKILL chased outside, dropped back and faded.
