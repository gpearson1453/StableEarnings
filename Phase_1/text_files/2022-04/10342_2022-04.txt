Footnotes
Following a six minute delay due to a technical issue, FORESTWOOD LANE got bumped at the start by TUESDAY'S CHILD, who broke out a step, raced
briefly eight paths off the inside in the chute before tucking in two paths down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn following INFEASIBLE and
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced and went seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final
furlong, had TUESDAY'S CHILD get directed out and was bumped when seizing command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to
prevail. TUESDAY'S CHILD broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe, raced briefly six paths off the inside out of the chute before migrating
inside to the two path to show the way in hand, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as a pair of rivals advanced to apply pressure, swung four wide into
upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was directed outwards to bump with
FORESTWOOD LANE when that rival poked a head in front, ran on clear of the rest for the place honors. INFEASIBLE eight paths off the inside briefly out
of the chute, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went six
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MAD DOCTOR got bumped at the start by JUMP STARTER, who broke inwards, came under
coaxing and briefly raced five paths off the inside before making his way to the rail out of the chute, tipped three wide at the five furlong marker before
tucking to the inside into the turn placed to urging half a mile from home, rode the rail through the turn and into upper stretch and tired. JUMP STARTER
broke in at the start bumping MAD DOCTOR, raced briefly eight paths off the inside before tucking four wide down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile
from home, came under brief and light coaxing midway on the turn, cornered three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HYDRA was urged along off the pace, raced inside early on the turn, shifted three wide midway through that bend then moved to four wide, gained to take
the lead in the seven path in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. BABY BOSS was
hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, controlled the action in the two then three path around the turn, was roused at the
five-sixteenths, floated five wide into upper stretch then lost the advantage to the winner at the three-sixteenths, battled inside that foe in the final furlong
and was outfinished while able to get the place. VIOLENT POINT pressed the pace on the outside, went three wide early on the turn, moved to four then
five wide while chasing later on that bend, was carried eight wide into upper stretch, pursued the leaders to the wire and lacked the needed kick but finished
with good courage for the show. SWEET MIA was last to commence, chased the pace on the outside, went four wide early on the turn, moved to the five
then six path later on that bend, was carried nine wide into upper stretch, pursued the leaders on the outside to the wire and was out-kicked then just missed
the show. MISS PEPPINA dropped back on the outside under urging, angled from the five path to the three path into the turn, moved to the rail nearing the
quarter-pole, came a bit off the inside in upper stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
NEW YORK BANKER established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside through swift splits, got set down spinning four wide into upper
stretch, shied in a bit under a right handed crop and was corrected shying out under a left handed crop while inching away, dug in and held well and safe to
the finish kept to task. SARATOGA KISSES coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the place honors. CANDY MONET was off heels early on three paths off the inside before tucking to the rail,
chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. THE HONORABLE RUTH
three wide in pursuit, advanced into closest aim of the leader into the turn, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the very late stages. ALICIA'S WAY five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled eight wide at the head of
the stretch and weakened. FLOWER MOON hustled from the gate, flashed brief speed four wide in closest aim of the leader early on, faded through the turn
pushed along from midway and went seven wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
LIAM'S FIRE pressed the pace on the inside of a rival, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two then three path around the turn, lost the
advantage to JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ into upper stretch, fought back inside that foe to regain the lead into the final furlong and edged clear in the final
sixteenth under strong urging. DOUBLE SHOT was urged along on the outside at the rear, moved in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the
three path, swung six wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just get the place. JOYCEE HAZ PIZZAZ came outward just after the break,
showed speed then chased the pace, angled out in the vicinity of the five-eighths pole, went four to five wide on the turn, gained to take a short lead into
upper stretch, lost the advantage back to the winner into the final furlong, battled with that foe to the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished then lost the place
while able to get the show. SOMEBODY was carried out some just after the start and in close briefly off heels, settled while last but one, was urged along in
the two path around the turn and failed to rally. KAREN'S COVE set the pace under pressure to his inside, lost the advantage near the seven-sixteenths,
vied in the three to four path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired.

Following a slight delay due to first time starter JACKIE'S A FOX appearing injured warming up and being vanned off, DAREDEVIL BULL hustled from the
gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and drew off under a drive
getting geared down in the final seventy yards to the finish. REELEY PSYCHED broke out at the start and was corrected, chased six then five wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors.
TORREN'S TALE coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened.
WORK IT OUT hustled from the start, chased four then three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.

MR BREADWINNER broke in then was hustled, went clear early and showed the way while in hand, was asked in the two path on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, drew off into the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage under strong urging. FEATHERS ROAD settled near the back
early, moved out with five furlongs to run, was urged four wide through the turn and finished willingly for the place. SINFUL DANCER was carried in at the
break, tracked the pace on the inside of an opponent, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased in the three path through the turn and weakened
while far clear for the show. GO LIME angled out entering the main-track, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped in leaving the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CHAPEL ROAD settled just off the pace on the outside, chased
three wide on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and faltered. LISTENING IN quickly fell well behind the rest of the field and was eased but

handed crop and held gamely to the finish. DIVA BANKER four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path in behind the pace dispute
through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, angled seven wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to issue a challenge a
furlong out, dug in drifting out slightly to the finish and was ultimately repelled on the wire. PRAIRIE FIRE vied from the five path between foes down the

Footnotes
PRETTY CLEVER was urged along off the pace, went four wide around the turn, rallied outside in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead outside the
sixteenth-pole then drew clear under steady urging. BLAME IT ON MARY was hustled to the front then set the clear pace, went around the turn in the two
path, led under a drive into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner while clear for the place. BIG TONY'S GIRL brushed with a rival at the start,
was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the three path, moved out in upper stretch and just got up for the show while no threat to the top
two. VELVET SISTER broke out and brushed with a foe then was sent, moved out while hard ridden off the pace, dropped to the two path leaving the
backstretch, remained in the two path through the turn, came out under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. PEAK OF CHIC
chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, dropped back between foes in upper stretch and tired. JEN'S BATTLE was urged
along at the back, went four wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten.
