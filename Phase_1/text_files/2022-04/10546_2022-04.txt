LULUMARU sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task, proving much the best. CATCAKE pressed the pace, raced three
wide around the final turn, made a bid down the lane, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. STORIED TRIP raced near the back, saved
ground, made a mild bid and proved no match for the top two. BE A BANDIT was an early factor, racing behind the leader, faded at the 3/4 pole and finished
evenly near the back. STREAMER void of early speed and trailed throughout.

the early going, moved up, four wide around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. SOCIAL DATE lacked early speed,
showed late interest down the home stretch and was a clear third at the wire. US SECOND CUTE PIE void of early speed, finished wide and passed tired
ones. BETISON shot to the front, drove clear, was collared down the backside, dueling with AMERICAN FIRST, saved ground around the turn and faded.

SABER CUT pressed the pace, made a bid entering the home stretch, rallied and was going away at the end. TECATE TIME unhurried in the beginning,
moved up on the inside around the turn, made a stretch bid, proved no match for the winner, but got by a tiring SOPHIE'S PRAYER for second. SOPHIE'S
PRAYER sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired late. SMOK'N RITA void of early speed, improved position, but was no factor.
EXPLOSIVELY HOT raced near the back, came around the turn on the outside, put forth an even effort and was never a threat. MISS NITAP raced within
striking distance and dropped back.

early speed, raced outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and was a clear second at the wire. KEYS INCLUDED dueled on the front end, saved
ground, proved no match for the top two, but outfinished FULL OF GLORY for the show position. FULL OF GLORY was an early factor, forwardly placed
throughout and was outfinished for third. GHOST COWBOY raced within striking distance, put forth an even effort and was no threat late. INDEFENSIBLE
void of early speed and was never close. WHISKEY OVER ICE dueled for the early advantage and was finished early.

Footnotes
MSCHITCHATTOUR unhurried in the early part, racing near the middle of the pack, moved up around the final turn, made a wide rally and finished strong,
driving clear before the wire. LUCKY LINDA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was best of others.
SLEWPY'S HALO went to the front, drove clear and lacked a late kick. OVERLY SWEET lacked early speed, finished wide and showed late interest.
SUFFRAGETTE raced in the middle of the field, came around the first turn wide, made a bid and weakened. TABLE ONE raced near the back, moved up,
faded and was no threat late. LAST DESTINY raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun. CABO SUNSET void of early speed and
showed little.
