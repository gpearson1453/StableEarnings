Footnotes
CONGRESS HALL stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, secured command at the head of the stretch then drew away under steady handling. MISS
MORENO set the early pace, saved ground around the turn, failed to match strides with the winner through the stretch and held the place. GOLD TIME
VIXEN , a forward factor along the inner rail entering the turn, eased out approaching the stretch, drifted to the seven path in mid stretch and flattened out.
SIMMARD SHENANIGAN raced in the two path entering the turn, swung to the four path turning for home and lacked the necessary rally.
LETMESLIDEBYYOU , kept four wide on the turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch, weakened and was eased.

Footnotes
BESTLA was nudged up between rivals to take a short lead, handled outside pressure under nice rating, was roused clear three wide in upper stretch,
widened past mid stretch, was kept alert with left handed asking and held firm. COLOROFACLOUD , outside rivals and off the early pace, dropped in a bit
around the turn, came back out for the drive and closed steadily to gain the place. TIPSY TOURIST had speed and forced the pace outside the winner,
came four wide for the drive, shifted in pursuing past mid stretch and faded. EL MILAGRA , towards the inside with pursuit, came out for the drive but lacked
a rally. PEARLYVILLE drafted back off the early pace and was outrun. BIG EYE JOY failed to menace. AMARETTO SOUR edged up early to take a stalking
spot off the inside, was under asking mid turn, failed to kick on entering the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CONTENTED NOW rated kindly in about the five path early on, dropped in and moved up three wide under confident handling mid turn, went on the attack
soon after, dueled then wrested a short lead in upper stretch, shook clear under left handed asking past the three sixteenths then steadily pulled away while
kept to a drive. SOLOMON'S CHOICE settled off the pace while saving ground, came under pressure mid turn, cut the corner into the lane, quickly gained
heading to the furlong grounds, failed to kick on with the winner but stayed willingly to be well clear of the rest. SPRITZER drifted out at the break, corrected
and went clear, set the pace towards the inside, took pressure leaving the far turn, battled two wide and to the inside of the winner from the five sixteenths to
upper stretch, stayed with interest to mid stretch then faded. DOCTOR DOOM broke a step slow, raced well off the inside and exchanged bumps with
MCQUEEN'S BULLITT early on, was under a solid ride leaving the far turn, raced very wide in upper stretch but could not muster up much of a run.
MCQUEEN'S BULLITT , very wide early and bumped around with DOCTOR DOOM, dropped in leaving the far turn and made a bit of progress mid turn,
came back out for the drive but lacked a serious run. STIMULUS MAKER drifted out the break, straightened and prompted the pace outside SPRITZER,
applied more pressure while under a hearty ride mid turn, failed to keep pace into the lane, angled four wide and faded. ORO GRIS , well wide and off the
early pace, faltered.

Footnotes
MUTAKAAMIL , in tight quarters soon after the break, steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail near the five sixteenths pole, his rider dropped his whip
when brushing with LOST IN MANHATTAN in upper stretch then closed determinedly along the inner rail to score late. W W SPRINGTIME sped to the early
lead, raced near the inner rail around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. LOST IN MANHATTAN , a forward factor in the two path
on the turn, brushed with the winner in upper stretch then steadied in tight quarters inside the eighth pole when BIG RALL DAWG drifted in in front of him.
BIG TALL DAWG off a bit sluggishly, was hard used four wide on the turn, flattened out and drifted in inside the eighth pole. THE WALK , in the three path
chasing the pace around the turn, weakened. OUR HOISTED MAST , very wide on the turn, was outrun. HAIR OF THE DOG weakened.

Footnotes
BACKNTHEWOODS cleared at once and was pushed along, had some brief company towards his inside in the opening furlong, opened up a long lead
under a ride into the turn, remained strong handling three wide into the lane, wandered outward a bit, straightened and held sway. RAISE A SPEIGHTS ,
forwardly placed in the opening eighth while saving ground, saw the leaders get away from him heading to the turn, remained inside around the turn and
through the lane and leveled off nicely to gain through the final furlong. THAT'S RIGHT edged up to the inside of the winner early and gave closest pursuit,
was under a ride off the rail giving hard chase into the lane and kept on trying to the wire. CARVELLIAN QUEST , behind rivals leaving the far turn, dropped
inside around the turn, swung out six to seven wide in upper stretch and closed steadily. UNION FLEET , checked between rivals near the half mile pole,
angled seven to eight wide for the drive and had some late action under hand asking. VIOLENT ROCK chased and came up empty. OUR FREEDOM broke
a step slow, raced four to five wide early and was not a factor. GLASTONBURY , three to four wide, altered in for the drive but came up empty.

Footnotes
EXCELLORATOR saved ground around the turn chasing the pace, had ample room along the inner rail to take the lead near the sixteenth pole then drove
clear. RUFFY set the pace while well off the inner rail, finished willingly but failed to repel the winner. SPITBALL , well positioned in the two path around the
turn, lacked the needed rally in an even effort, drifted out late and lightly bumped with BIG VENEZUELA near the finish. BIG VENEZUELA unprepared for
the start when misbehaving, was kept four wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper stretch, had a mild gain and was bumped lightly at the wire.
ELUSIVE KNIGHT , along the inner rail on the turn, lacked a rally. WICKED MAD , four wide leaving the turn, weakened. Objections by the trainer and rider
of BIG VENEZUELA against SPITBALL for alleged interference in the stretch drive were not allowed. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but
no action was taken.

Footnotes
MARKET OF STOCKS , six wide outside rivals and well in range heading to the turn, dropped in a few paths and quickly moved up to take over past the five
sixteenths, widened without much effort leaving the three sixteenths and was only briefly roused winning as much the best. KOBE'S GIRL , forced the early
pace between runners, gave hard chase off the rail mid turn, shifted four to five wide and continued with effort to be clear of the rest. SATISFIED , off slow
after hopping at the break, raced between runners early, dropped in around the turn, remained there and closed mildly. ALY DID IT eased back off the
leaders early on, angled out for the drive and had a mild response. ROYAL FLUSH GIRL broke a step slow, saved ground leaving the far turn and failed to
rally. HOLY PINK set a pressured pace inside a trio of foes heading to the half mile marker, yielded to the winner past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about
mid stretch then faded. SHE'S A TRIPP forced the early pace three wide and between runners and gave way. SHE'S A REBEL , four deep with the pace
nearing the turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, came very wide for the drive and dropped back.
