Footnotes
SHOULDA HAD IT , well placed in the three path on the turn, eased out to the four path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside horses and was up at the
wire. HIGH PRINT bobbled slightly at the break, prompted the pace outside HANDS DOWN, gained the lead in upper stretch, went clear in mid stretch and
gave way grudgingly. SEVEN PLUS SEVEN lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in upper stretch, swung outside in mid stretch
and rallied. CAMP PENDLETON bore out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, drifted to the five path turning for home and failed to menace.
TRADITION , outrun, raced along the inner rail in the stretch. HANDS DOWN set a pressured pace along the inner rail, drifted out in mid stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
WRITEITONTHEICE leaned in and brushed with a rival to be off a bit slow, quickly recovered and accelerated between foes to join the pace fray, emerged
in a pace battle to the inside of STACKS OF SILVER leaving the three quarter pole, was nicely rated around the turn, responded when put to strong
handling heading to mid stretch, shook clear soon after and was kept alert to late. REBEL FAITH moved up inside foes leaving the chute and garnered a
stalking spot, was pushed along while easing off the rail past the three eighths, gave hard chase to the inside of WHIZWIT from the head of the lane, kept
on grinding and just got the place. WHIZWIT veered out at the break, corrected and raced within range while removed from the inside, chased between
runners mid turn, was fanned out to about the four path entering the lane, straightened and raced outside REBEL FAITH from there, remained on his left
lead, churned on but was edged for second. STACKS OF SILVER broke outward then corrected and advanced to dispute the pace, battled outside the
winner from three quarter pole, briefly moved to a slim lead soon into the lane, carried the fight past mid stretch then faded in the final fifty yards. SUCCEED
, sluggish from the gate, was used four wide outside rivals to gain into the turn, chased three deep mid turn, had nothing to give entering the lane and
dropped back. EL PATOJO , forced out at the break, raced off the pace, angled out around the turn but failed to menace. HAPPYIZE , off the pace, saved
ground into the lane and failed to threaten. SURPRISE HELLO flashed speed to the inside of horses, eased back off the leaders nearing the three quarter
pole, stayed in range to the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
MICRO STAR came out a bit at the break and bumped with B B BAD, corrected and rated kindly three wide early on, cruised up and overtook PIT STOP
MAN leaving the far turn, dropped in clearing and was nicely handled, turned away a threat from TATE nearing the lane, responded when put to firm asking
and kicked clear, widened off the rail in mid stretch then held firm while kept alert through the final sixteenth. TATE , well placed under some rating, edged
up between runners leaving the half mile marker, bid outside the winner approaching the stretch, failed to match strides but continued on to give willing
chase to the wire. B B BAD drifted in at the break and bumped with the winner, straightened and settled inside, made a ground saving run past the three
eighths, gave hard chase from the head of the lane but came up empty in the final furlong. CONTENTED NOW stalked inside, was shuffled back behind a
tiring rival near the half mile mark, angled out and lacked a bid. GARITOFF , four wide, steadily advanced mid turn, lacked a kick from the head of the lane
and retreated. PIT STOP MAN rushed clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was collared near the half mile pole, gave little resistance and faltered.

disputing the pace, opened a clear lead near the sixteenth pole and weakened. POP POP SUSI , in the two path between horses disputing the pace to mid
stretch, weakened in the drive. BOURBONONTHEROCKS lacked speed, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. DR RAGS ,
outrun early, was fanned eight deep in upper stretch and passed tired foes. ROAD WARRIOR saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, was taken to the
four path in upper stretch and gave way. BOWIE TWO STEP , three deep around the turn, disputed the pace to mid stretch then gave way.

Footnotes
TRUE VALOUR (IRE) broke sharply, was nicely rated towards the rail handling some pressure from two foes to his outside, moved clear into the turn,
responded when roused soon into the lane, opened up under a strong ride in mid stretch, drifted out a bit while under left handed asking inside the sixteenth
pole, dug in tenaciously and kept GRATEFUL BRED at bay. GRATEFUL BRED edged up early and rated in the clear while in range of the leading trio,
angled out leaving the far turn, circled three to four wide making progress into the lane, saw the winner get away a bit heading to the furlong grounds,
leveled off with a sixteenth to go and came on nicely to bridge the gap. BATTLE STATION , taken to rate early, dropped in leaving the far turn, cut the
corner into the stretch, remained inside through the drive and closed steadily. CAN THE QUEEN attended the pace three deep early on, shadowed the
winner three wide approaching the stretch, willingly pursued past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. FAIR CATCH had speed between foes, rated
back nearing the turn and angled in to stalk, eased back out in upper stretch and continued with interest. IMA PHAROAH rated in the clear leaving the far
turn, came three wide for the drive and churned on between runners. AMERICAN D'ORO , off slowly, raced well back into and around the turn, swung out
very wide past the quarter pole and had belated action outside foes. VALUED NOTION , taken to rate off the pace, was lightly steadied nearing the turn,
angled out, circled five wide but came up empty. DENDROBIA , off the pace while saving ground, angled out into the lane but lacked a solid run. RAD
PAISLEY broke a step slow, raced off the rail into the lane, angled in heading to mid stretch but failed to menace.

Footnotes
KAYLASAURUS , rated behind horses on the turn, swung to the five path approaching the stretch, closed steadily outside rivals and took the lead inside the
sixteenth pole. PRODIGY DOLL raced in the three path between horses while prompting the pace around the turn and in the stretch, bid for the lead near
the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. STREET LUTE , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened late. PRINCESS KOKACHIN set a
pressured pace in the two path around the turn and in the stretch and gave way approaching the sixteenth pole. HOPE HAS A NAME lacked speed and was
not a serious factor. PAISLEY SINGING hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace and gave way approaching the eighth pole.

DECIDING VOTE settled nicely while in the clear and off of a contested pace, responded when given her cue off the rail leaving the far turn, swept up six
wide outside rivals to gain into the lane, sustained on her left lead and under left handed asking, forged past IN A HURRY near the sixteenth pole then held
firm while switching over to her correct lead in the final yards. IN A HURRY rated outside a rival early on, took closer order leaving the three eighths, angled
out then was fanned five wide and bumped when challenging into the lane, spurted clear after being roused past the three sixteenths, failed to contain the
winner's charge but kept on well to the wire. COCONUT CAKE settled within range while saving ground, awaited some room near the five sixteenths, eased
out three wide and moved up into the lane, steadied briefly when put in a bit close by MUCHA MEZQUINA near the furlong grounds, regrouped to work
between runners and churned on. FIONNBHARR settled well back, angled five to six wide into the lane and closed steadily. OUT OF SORTS drafted well
back, saved ground and gained some steam leaving the far turn, eased out then moved up between runners in upper stretch, steadied in traffic from the
three sixteenths to mid stretch, altered in and finished with interest. DOUBLE FIREBALL , three deep early, settled outside rivals, moved up five wide and to
the inside of the winner entering the lane, kept on willingly to mid stretch then flattened out. FOGGY DREAMS , between runners past the three quarter
pole, dropped in, made a bit of a run while saving ground past the three sixteenths, checked soon after, altered out and had a bit of late action. MUCHA
MEZQUINA tracked the duel while saving ground, eased out nearing the lane, briefly threatened then faded in the final furlong. TIC TIC TIC BOOM , off the
pace, came six wide for the drive and failed to menace. TRAFFIC SONG got into a pace battle inside of DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA soon after the break,
held the lead nearing the far turn, ceded the lead with a quarter to go, kept on to about mid stretch then weakened. DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA disputed the
pace outside TRAFFIC SONG, regained command nearing the quarter pole, drifted out and bumped with IN A HURRY when confronted soon after, faltered
and was eased late.

ROUGH SEA hugged the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch, was in hand waiting for room mid way on the far turn, swung to the four path at
the head of the stretch, closed outside horses, took command inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. BIRD KING stalked the pace outside horses down
the backstretch, advanced four deep mid way on the far turn, challenged for the lead outside WORKIN ON A DREAM in upper stretch, dueled and
weakened in the drive. PLOT THE DOTS , three wide leaving the first turn, advanced in the three path leaving the far turn, had aim on the lead in mid
stretch and flattened out. WORKIN ON A DREAM stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the three path to take the lead near the three eighths
pole, dueled inside BIRD KING in the stretch and weakened the final sixteenth of a mild. FOREWARNED lacked speed, was four deep leaving the far turn
and failed to rally. AIN'T DA BEER COLD prompted the pace two wide and faltered after six furlongs. BIG VENEZUELA set a pressured pace along the

CHEZ PIERRE (FR) came away in good order then angled in and relaxed in the clear off of a contested pace, eased out a bit when starting a run leaving
the far turn, rolled up outside FIELD PASS approaching the quarter pole then was floated out briefly to be about six wide, entering the lane, shifted back in
and assumed command outside foes leaving the three sixteenths, quickly kicked clear after being set down, drew away emphatically under pressure leaving
the eighth pole and was kept alert while switching to his left lead in the final yards. MANDATE settled off the pace and was angled out for the backstretch
run, pulled his way forward off the rail into the far turn, angled about four wide mid way on the final turn, found his best stride through the final sixteenth and
just got up for the place. FIELD PASS found himself in a perfect spot tracking a contested pace three wide, took closer order into the far turn, wandered five
wide when moving up past the quarter pole, straightened to challenge between foes soon into the lane, was overwhelmed by the winner heading to mid
stretch then gave way grudgingly while losing the place in the final jumps. OCEANS MAP , in a bit tight at the break, regrouped and was taken to rate well
off the pace, edged up toward the rail leaving the far turn, eased out for the drive and finished with iinterest. SIR ALFRED JAMES , in close at the start, was
under early rating while saving ground, edged up into the far turn, moved a bit closer past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on from there and faded.
HIGHWAY BOUND came out a bit at the break tightening foes, joined ROCK ON LUTE from his inside into the first turn then took over, sparred through the
opening half mile, shook clear around the far turn, was under asking to hold command into the lane, ceded the lead three sixteenths out and weakened.
ROCK ON LUKE , brushed at the break, was sent up between foes soon after, vied outside HIGHWAY BOUND, failed to kick on under asking entering the
far turn and faltered.
