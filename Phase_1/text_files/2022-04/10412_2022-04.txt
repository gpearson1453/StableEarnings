moved away without much asking leaving the three eighths, responded to rousing in upper stretch, failed to contain the winner but continued gamely to the

Footnotes
ASKIN FOR A BASKIN edged up nearing the five eighths and stalked outside of IT'S SIZZLING TIME, came under a ride mid turn, closed in steadily under
left handed asking and moved alongside with an eighth to go, secured command heading to the sixteenth marker and kicked clear under a drive.
JEBOLOGIST stalked the pace off the inside, circled four wide under a ride into the lane, leveled off to his best stride past the furlong grounds, finished up
with good energy and just nabbed the place. IT'S SIZZLING TIME was hard sent from the gate and cleared soon after, set the pace towards the inside, was
under asking past the five sixteenths to hold position, dug in when collared near mid stretch, fought on to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. MAID
THE JOURNEY lagged off the pace, raced three wide into the lane and had belated action between runners. ANTIPOISON lagged off the pace while saving
ground, continued inside into the lane, eased out late but failed to generate a solid kick. BOURBON AND ICE drafted back off the pace while four wide,
circled five wide into the stretch but came up empty.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY INDYGO opened up leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, came in and bumped CHARMING WAY in upper stretch,
battled through the stretch and narrowly prevailed. SHE IS WISKY lacked speed, circled foes on the turn, swung to the four path approaching the stretch,
drifted in a bit in the drive and rallied outside the winner. CHARMING WAY stalked the pace, hugged the inner rail on the turn, challenged for the lead inside
BLUEBERRY INDYGO leaving the turn, was bumped near the quarter pole and continued gamely through the drive. JACKIE THE JOKER , along the inner
rail on the turn, eased out in mid stretch and finished evenly. LADY ZETA chased the pace, was three wide leaving the turn, gave way and lugged in inside
the eighth pole. PEACEFUL SURPRISE was always outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry and an objection by the rider of CHARMING WAY, BLUEBERRY
INDYGO was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
KEEPING THE EDGE took over three wide between rivals early on and set a rated pace under pressure, dropped down a bit leaving the far turn and was
nursed along, turned away a threat by ZEN MASTER soon into the lane, kicked away under strong handling in mid stretch, was flashed the whip while
solidly hand ridden inside the sixteenth pole, held firm then returned sore and was vanned off. NATAGAR drifted out at the break and steadied, regrouped
then quickly pulled his way forward while between rivals and gained a stalking spot, steadied briefly leaving the far turn, moved up to the inside of a foe near
mid stretch, angled out soon after and closed gamely to gain. LAST ROMANCE , in range three wide and between runners into the turn, lost ground four
wide pursuing outside rivals past the three eighths, edged up then angled in for the final furlong and kept on willingly to earn the show. UNCLE IRISH , four
to five wide outside runners early on, ranged up four wide mid turn, chased while continuing well wide into the lane, stayed on past the eighth pole then
flattened out late. ZEN MASTER , four wide prompting the pace, shadowed the winner mid turn, went on the attack soon after, failed to kick on past the
quarter pole and gave way. MR. MOX vied inside early on and faltered around the turn. UNDER THE RADAR had his rider lose the irons shortly after the
start, galloped around, was eased up and distanced.

Footnotes
SHADY MUNNI , wide on the turn, brushed with MAJESTIC FRONTIER near the three eights pole, floated to the six path in mid stretch, rallied outside
horses, led late and drove clear. HEFFNER , soundly and forced out by HOLY SyNCHRONICITY leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while in the two
path on the turn, gained a short lead near the eighth pole then weakened. HEARTNESS saved ground around the turn while setting the pace, dueled to the
eighth pole and weakened late. MAJESTIC FRONTIER bumped ONE TEN when drifting in leaving the starting gate, raced between horses on the turn,
brushed with the winner approaching the stretch, was taken to the inner rail in upper stretch and lacked the needed late effort. ONE TEN , soundly bumped
on both sides leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses on the turn and was not a factor. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY bore out leaving the starting gate,
raced along the inner rail on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and weakened. LORD MIO , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
CANOODLE rated outside a rival and in range of the leaders, edged up and tracked the duel mid turn, came under pressure soon after, moved up outside
runners and took over nearing mid stretch, kicked clear under a drive then held sway. WHO KNOWS WHAT was squeezed back soon after the start,
regrouped and settled towards the inside, moved up while saving ground into the lane, swung out past the three sixteenths and closed nicely to gain.
HONOR YOUR MOTHER edged up while saving ground into the turn, stalked the leaders mid turn, eased out for some room in upper stretch, moved
between then churned on. QUIET IMAGINATION lacked speed, raced five wide in upper stretch and had belated action. MAGICAL LUNA sped to the front
and set the pace towards the rail, was joined into the turn, dueled around the turn and into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then faded.
SUNSHINEANRAINBOWS , three deep nearing the half mile marker, shifted well wide for the drive but lacked a serious rally. PEACE OUT prompted the
pace outside the leader, moved to even terms around the far turn, sparred then grabbed command past the five sixteenths, ceded to the winner nearing mid
stretch then gave way through the final sixteenth.
