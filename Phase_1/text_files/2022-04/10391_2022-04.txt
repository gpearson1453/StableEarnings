Footnotes
SPARKA (IRE) was allowed to settle off of the early pace, gained ground four wide on the second turn, continued that rally into the drive to take command
into the final furlong, could not completely shake free from the stubborn runner-up but dug in in the final stages to prevail. RUN FOR MY HONEY steadied
off of heels into the first turn, stalked the pace from a two wide path, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker,
could not get by the determined winner but was well clear of the rest for second. THREE DIMENSIONAL saved ground while just off of the early pace, was
steered to the two path on the far turn, drifted in midway through the turn and took the path of HAPPY IS, lost ground into the stretch run and did not offer a
final bid but kept on to earn the show. PRAY TO AN ANGEL broke alertly and cleared the field into the first turn to set the pace, was engaged by BELLEO'S
FOREST and dueled with that foe while setting moderate fractions, lost ground into the stretch run and gave way in the final stages. BELLEO'S FOREST
engaged with PRAY TO AN ANGEL on the first turn to dispute the pace, gave ground to that rival on the second turn and tired in the drive. HAPPY IS
settled just off of the pace while saving ground, took up midway on the second turn when THREE DIMENSIONAL drifted in and was eased through the
stretch while not persevered with. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT ON THE SECOND TURN INVOLVING HAPPY IS
AND THREE DIMENSIONAL, AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THREE DIMENSIONAL DRIFTED IN AND COST HAPPY IS THE
CHANCE OF A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED THREE DIMENSIONAL FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH.

Footnotes
THEYREMINISCEOVERU tracked the quick early pace, advanced three deep on the turn, continued that bid in upper stretch and closed in the final
sixteenth under firm urging to prevail in the end. HANDSOME GARY was hustled leaving the break, pressed the fast early pace, took a narrow advantage
into the final furlong and was tagged in the final strides by the fast closing winner while just holding for second. COUNTING CARDS saved ground while
chasing the early quick pace, closed willingly in the drive and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. SATANTA lacked early speed, mounted a
two wide rally into the stretch run, improved position in the late going but did not offer the needed late response. HONEYMOONZ OVER broke alertly, was
sent to set fast disputed fractions, was caught nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages.

SENOR DEL CAMPO saved ground while unhurried early on, was roused five wide into the stretch run, had a good kick in mid stretch to strike the front and
drew clear in the end. FANTASTIC DREAM settled off of the early pace while three wide, mounted a four wide rally into the drive, was outkicked by the
winner in the final sixteenth but was best of the rest. DADDYS SPECIALDARK was unhurried in the early stages, improved position three wide on the
second turn and into upper stretch but was outfinished in the end, while holding safely for third. DREW BIG was forwardly placed, gained ground three deep
in upper stretch but weakened in the late going. BOB DANIELS was hustled leaving the break and set the pace to the second turn, drifted in leaving the
furlong marker, ceded the lead at that spot and tired in the late stages. THEULTIMATEPRAISE settled just off of the early pace while keeping a two wide
path, gained ground leaving the second turn and into upper stretch, slipped to the inside, steadied off of heels when BOB DANIELS drifted in leaving the
furlong marker and gave way in the late going. STING LIKE A BEE stalked the pace, came into tight quarters while two wide between runners nearing the
furlong marker, lost ground into the drive and faded in the final stages. NON ESSENTIAL was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground while
trailing into the second turn and was not a factor. ANNIE'S CHIEF saved ground while forwardly placed, dropped back on the far turn, stopped in upper
stretch, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT LEAVING

Footnotes
ELGOFRANCO broke alertly and was sent in the early going, set moderate fractions through the turn, felt late pressure from the runner-up but determinedly
dug in under firm encouragement to prevail. WHAT UP NOW J T stalked the pace from the inside, advanced in upper stretch, made a steady gain on the
winner in the final stages, challenged in the final strides but could not get by the determined winner and was best of the rest. AFTER SUNDOWN tracked
the moderate pace from a two wide path on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages but held for the show. AMBA was
bumped leaving the gate and was away a step slowly, chased the pace three to four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. GARDEES
WORLD chased the pace four deep on the turn and tired in the stretch run. ASHLEY BEAUTIFUL broke out at the start, lacked early speed to the turn and
was not a factor.

Footnotes
MYBLUEBELL (FR) broke alertly and was hustled to the front, set reasonably quick fractions while being well handled into the second turn, extended the
lead off of the far turn and won in a drive. BORN TO REIGN stalked the pace from the midflight, advanced three wide on the far turn, was outkicked by the
winner in the stretch but kept on to edge clear for second. INDIAN DANCER stalked the early pace three deep on the first turn, improved position nearing
the quarter-marker, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and was edged out for second in the end.
MALIBU JEWEL settled off of the early pace, was three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground four deep on the second turn but lacked a final kick in
the stretch run. DEL MAR FLASH was a bit hard to load, stalked the early pace, lost ground into the drive and faded in the final stages. MISS SKI settled off
of the early pace while saving ground, was outrun on the second turn and was not a threat. STAND IN YOUR LOVE was away a bit slowly leaving the
break, was unhurried while saving ground to the second turn, was eased through the lane and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
LITTLE CASINO stalked the early quick pace, was steered four wide on the turn, closed fast in the final furlong to get by NORTHVALE ROAD and held
safely in the end. NORTHVALE ROAD tracked the pace three wide, was roused in upper stretch, took a narrow lead into the final furlong, could not hold off
the fast closing winner in the end but was clear for second. UNREAL was crowded a bit by his stablemate at the break and was away a step slowly, chased
the fast pace from the inside, gained ground in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the furlong grounds but was outkicked in the final stages, while
holding safely for the show. BIG PAPA STEVE chased the pace three wide on the turn and made a mild late gain in the drive. UNTO THEE crowded
UNREAL a bit at the start and was sent to the front, set quick fractions through the turn, was caught in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
COMMAND A PREMIUM chased the pace two deep on the turn and tired in the drive. NUESTRO ENGREIDO chased the fast pace from a five wide path on
the turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ECOLOGIST took back off of the early pace, saved ground through the second turn, angled out at the head of the lane, overtook OFFSHORE AFFAIR
inside of the sixteenth-marker and just lasted to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. HOLY GHOST was content to settle early on, saved ground through
the second turn, was roused leaving the bend, closed fast in the late stages to confront ECOLOGIST and just missed for the win, while clear of the rest for
second. OFFSHORE AFFAIR broke alertly, attended to the moderately quick early pace then was given rein to press the pace to the quarter-marker,
overhauled RECKONING DAY in upper stretch but could not hold off the winner in the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while holding safely for third. OF
GOOD REPORT bumped with FULL OF LUCK at the break, settled off of the early pace, was steered outside of rivals four wide on the far turn, improved in
the final furlong but was outkicked in late stages. FULL OF LUCK (CHI) made contact with OF GOOD REPORT at the start, was unhurried in the early
going, advanced in upper stretch and was outclosed in the final stages. J T'S WATCH settled off of the pace while saving ground and did not offer a late
rally. RECKONING DAY was sent leaving the start, set contested fractions through the quarter-marker, was caught leaving the second turn and faded in the
stretch run.

Footnotes
LEAVEITONTHEFIELD tracked the moderate early pace while in the clear two wide, overtook the pacesetter nearing the furlong grounds, was firmly
encouraged while under pressure from the runner-up and held to prevail in the end. ROBIE was under a tight hold and a bit hard to place on the first turn,
stalked the pace from a ground saving path to the second turn, shifted out leaving the bend, closed in the final sixteenth and could not reel in the winner in
the end but was best of the rest. OMMANEY BAY was sent after a good beginning and set the fractions to the quarter-pole, was caught by the winner in
upper stretch and was outfinished, but kept on to secure third. COUSIN MARK settled off of the pace, saved ground to the second turn and did not have a
late kick in the drive. EVEN STEVEN was unhurried early on, saved ground into the second turn and was not a factor. DIAMOND WILLOW settled just off of
the pace while outside of rivals and lacked a late response.
