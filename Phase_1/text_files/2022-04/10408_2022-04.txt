Footnotes
UNCLE ARMANDO raced off the pace four wide, angled six wide near the quarter pole, surged to the front near the eighth pole and drew off under a drive.
UNIMPEACHED tracked the pace while racing three wide between foes, bid between foes in midstretch, could not match strides with the winner but stayed
on to gain the place. SMALL REASON settled off the pace along the inside, edged closer three wide around the far turn, swung five wide near the quarter
pole to bid just inside of the winner but could not keep pace with that foe and settled for a share of third. CARIBBEAN GOLD was hustled from the gate, set
the pace in the two path, raced very wide while still clear down the backstretch, remained in front in the two path around the far turn, led to midstretch and
stayed on well enough to preserve a share of the show. ORIENTAL PARK stalked the pace inside and faded in the lane. SIMILAR TASTE broke awkwardly,
saved ground and failed to menace. SOLAR TAP chased the pace four wide and tired in the lane. THE WILD FLYER played no factor while racing two and
three wide. THE DUNGEON trailed inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MONTANA JOYCE pressed VALIANT MISS from outside, reached the front in deep stretch and prevailed after a long, hard drive. MYRA FLEENER hugged
the rail throughout, had ample room to come through on the fence turning for home, loomed a threat into the final furlong but did not have enough.
CROOKLYN raced in the second flight four to five wide for six furlongs, and plugged along out in the middle of the track to get up for the show. VALIANT
MISS veered out at the break, recovered and showed the way out of the chute well off the inside, moved in a bit through the turn, and gave way leaving the
furlong grounds. MISS YOUNIVERSE was no factor two wide. ICE LOVE raced three wide on the turn, and faded in the stretch. THE CUBAN MISSILE
showed some early speed, and was finished after a half-mile.

BOURBON OVER ICE was off a bit slowly, still sped to the front, set the pace in the two path, shook off a bid from the runner-up turning for home and
widened under a drive. SHEA D CAPTURE prompted the winner in the three path, could not keep pace in upper stretch but stayed on well enough to hold
second. PEMBERTON lacked early speed, raced two wide around the turn and was along for the show. MAGIC PRO chased the pace from the rail and
lacked a closing bid. LEGAL STAR was in range four wide and faded through the lane. ALL FOR GOLD failed to menace while racing three wide.
MACEDONIAN played no factor while racing three wide. KILLARGUE KELLY had brief speed two wide.

Footnotes
MY SUNNY VALENTINE took control after the start, rated along through an even pace for six furlongs, dug in when confronted by I BELIEVE IN MAGIC and
prevailed gamely. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC stalked outside MY SUNNY VALENTINE early, turned up the pressure reaching even terms approaching the
stretch, and was outgamed through a long drive. RIVETING SPIRIT was urged along on the far turn three then four wide, had aim through the lane and
finished up evenly outside the top two. PRINCESS BLAKELY was a step slow to begin, saved ground to the far turn, moved out to the three-path at the top
of the stretch, lugged in under pressure through the furlong grounds and lacked a solid bid. ISLA BONITA raced two to three wide on the turns, and had no
rally. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT raced well back throughout toward the inside.

CAMINERO prompted the pace three wide down the backstretch, took over near the seven-sixteenths marker, drew clear in the two path around the turn
and widened under a drive. GRAND PLAYER was off slow, trailed early, advanced four wide around the turn and ran on for the place. CASH EXPRESS set
the pace along the rail, yielded to the winner near the seven-sixteenths pole, chased inside around the turn and held third. STARSHIP ABRAHAM saved
ground and failed to menace. DOWN TO BIZZNESS bumped with MILLIENNIUM CONDO soon after the start, chased the pace three wide and came up
empty in the lane. TACTICAL CHEECH had early speed two wide and retreated around the turn. DUBROVNIK had brief speed inside. MILLENNIUM
CONDO bumped with DOWN TO BIZZNESS early, raced three wide and was through early.

Footnotes
LA RUSIA was never far back, moved up under urging three wide on the far turn, wrested command outside BELLE'S KINGDOM at the top of the stretch,
shifted to the rail and widened under a steady drive. MISS MAMBA raced in the second flight three wide to the stretch, and rallied mildly to go clear for the
place. BELLE'S KINGDOM tugged her way along contesting the pace outside BROADWAY PEGGY early, proved no match for the winner turning for home,
and weakened while able to salvage the show spot. RAISON THE GLASS bumped with DOLCISIMA at the start, stayed in range two wide for six furlongs,
and weakened. UNBRIDLED CHROME was no factor in and around the two-path. DOLCISIMA hit the right side of the gate and bumped with RAISON THE
GLASS at the start, and was outrun. BROADWAY PEGGY vied inside BELLE'S KINGDOM for nearly six furlongs, and had nothing left.

FOREVER SOUPER set the pace along the rail, shook clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. HASHTAG NO WONDER was bumped entering
the first turn, angled into the two path soon after, advanced three wide around the far turn and finished willingly to narrow the gap. NATIVE THUNDER
stalked the pace two and three wide and was one-paced through the lane to maintain the show. ANTHRACITE was bumped after the start, raced off the
pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was never a threat. GREG'S HONOR failed to menace while racing four and five wide. GRAND
DAVID was bumped after the start, checked while bearing out and bumping HASHTAG NO WONDER entering the first turn, was able to get back into the
three path early on the bend, raced four wide around the far turn and played no further factor. MR. CELLULAR stalked the pace inside and came up empty
in the lane. RACKET was bumped after the start, checked soon after, checked again entering the first turn, raced three and four wide and never threatened.
BELOVED WARRIOR tracked the pace three and four wide and had no response. LOOSE GOOSE was bumped after the start, saved ground and faltered
nearing the lane. SIR SAMUEL was bumped after the start, checked entering the first turn, saved ground and was never in contention. GUARD OF
HONOUR was bumped after the start, got pinched back soon after, was forced extremely wide into the first turn and was never a factor. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SIR OLLIE went up to take over outside REBELDE approaching the half-mile pole, edged away after six furlongs shifting inward, responded when hooked
from outside by DISC JOCKEY into the lane and withstood a long drive to get the decision. DISC JOCKEY loomed three wide coming to the quarter-pole,
battled outside SIR OLLIE through the stretch and came up second best. REBELDE led early inside, could not hold off challengers leaving the backstretch,
dropped back through the turn, then ran on well enough to snag the show. CAXAMBAS CANDY moved off the inside to the three-path on the turn, and
failed to menace. ASSERTIKO pressed the early pace, lodged a mild bid into the turn three then two wide, then weakened approaching the top of the
stretch. CRITICAL THREAT showed early speed between horses, but was through before reaching the turn. PERFECT SILENT CAT showed little trailing
throughout.

Footnotes
HONEY PANTS settled off the early pace while racing two wide, angled to the rail leaving the five-sixteenths marker, tipped three wide in upper stretch,
kicked in outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew off. RUNNING MEMORIES dueled along the rail to upper stretch, kicked clear nearing
the eighth pole, could not resist the winner but held clear of the rest. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY chased the pace four wide, angled in turning for home and
stayed on between foes to gain the show late. POSEIDON'S PASSION exchanged brushes with FOUZIA early, checked nearing the seven-sixteenths pole,
saved ground off the pace, checked again nearing the quarter pole, made some progress at the rail in upper stretch but was outfinished for third. FOUZIA
exchanged brushes early, chased the pace three wide and faded through the stretch. SAMMY'S TOWN dueled two wide to upper stretch and tired. DANA'S
BEAUTY played no factor while racing three wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ONE IDENTITY grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, showed the way in the two-path under constant pressure, and gamely turned back all comers.
STELLAR RIDE hugged the rail throughout, bid inside ONE IDENTITY through the stretch but came up second best. JUMEIRAH settled in midpack early,
fanned five wide approaching the stretch, and ran on willingly to go clear of the others. ROBBING ROBIN raced in striking range three to four wide to the
stretch, and lacked a solid bid. DIA DE SOL saved ground outrun for a half-mile, moved off the inside through midstretch and improved on the far outside.
LADY BAFFLED pressed ONE IDENTITY from outside for a half-mile, and faltered through the drive. MI NEGRITA was outrun three to four wide. OFFALY
FAST moved off the inside around the turn, but faded steadily.

Footnotes
FAKE I D settled off the pace while racing two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole, surged to the front near the sixteenth pole and drew off under
left-handed urging. JOYFUL SURPRISE dueled between foes, drew clear near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole, had no response for the winner
but held second. MINDSHIP Q raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide near the quarter pole and was along for the show. STRONG AGAIN chased
the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. FULL OF MISCHIEF saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and had a mild gain
between foes. GLORY AND VICTORY bobbled at the break, raced off the pace two wide, shifted further out in upper stretch had a mild gain and appeared
to clip heels late. JIMMY'S MISTRESS was pinched back soon after the start, raced four wide and never threatened. TINKER TAILER dueled along the rail
for three furlongs, steadied nearing the quarter pole and faded inside. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR checked midway down the backstretch, chased the pace three
wide, weakened in midstretch then checked again late. COLORS dueled three wide and faltered in the lane. THE RIDER OF TINKER TAILER CLAIMED
FOUL AGAINST JOYFUL SURPRISE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN BUT THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER
THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
