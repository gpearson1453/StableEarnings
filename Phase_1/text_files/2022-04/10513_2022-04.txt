Footnotes
DUBROVSKY raced three wide off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, rallied outside of FLATEXCEL, dueled with that
rival through the final furlong and prevailed at the wire. FLATEXCEL dueled inside for the lead, shook free on the far turn, responded when faced with a new
challenge, dug in gamely inside of DUBROVSKY, dueled with that rival through the stretch drive and missed. RISQUE REBEL hesitated and was off slowly,
raced off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out and lacked a rally in the lane. YONDERING raced off the pace between rivals, chased
on the far turn and tired. CANTSTOPRUNNING dueled two wide for the lead, chased on the far turn and faded in the stretch. SPEED SYNDROME raced off
the pace inside, moved up three wide on the backside, then four wide on the far turn and gave way in the lane. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the
race was declared official.

chased on the turn and weakened. ELITE MISSION chased between rivals early, chased on the turn and tired. DOUGIE stumbled and the start and was
bumped, then outrun early and passed tired foes. RISING STORM raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. RUN FAST stalked outside rivals, raced
