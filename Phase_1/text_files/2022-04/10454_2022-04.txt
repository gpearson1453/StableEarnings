WHERE'S JOEY vied inside of UNCLE B to midstretch, edged ahead of that foe and just lasted over POPPY'S BOYS late surge. POPPY'S BOYS settled

midstretch and was outfinished between the top tow. NO NAY MAYBE (IRE) failed to menace while racing two wide. SMOKY BLUES stalked the pace three
wide, bid nearing the lane but tired soon after. KATIE'S COWBOY trailed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. FINAL TIME CHANGED AND

CASH IN A FLASH pressed the pace outside SUNSET PROVISION and STAT, wrested command turning for home and edged clear under a steady drive.
STAT bumped with CROONER at the start, pressed the pace between CASH IN A FLASH and SUNSET PROVISION, steadied unable to maintain his
position at the top of the stretch, then ran on with good courage staying on his left lead. SUNSET PROVISION set the pace inside for six furlongs, stayed on
his left lead and weakened through the stretch. CROONER bumped with STAT at the start, and turned in an even effort from the two-path. FUSION JAZZ
broke a step slow, and was never a factor. SIR TERRE broke a step slow, raced three wide and failed to menace. LORD JAXSTON tired inside after a
half-mile. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF STAT FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH WAS
NOT ALLOWED.

ESPECIALLEA settled in range two wide, angled four wide turning for home, rallied outside, reached near even terms leaving the sixteenth pole, vied
outside of foes and prevailed. MERZAZ led early, rated back inside, saved ground in range around both turns, tipped three wide in upper stretch, bid
between foes leaving the eighth pole, briefly led in deep stretch and was narrowly outfinished. NEVERSTOPDREAMING pressed the pace two wide, took
the lead near the quarter pole, led much of the stretch and fought on inside of the top two in the later yards. MACK set the pace along the rail, was collared
near the quarter pole, vied inside to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished late. SKYWALKING raced off the pace two wide, swung widest in upper stretch
and had only a mild belated rally. TRIPLE JEOPARDY tracked the pace three wide and faded in the lane. KING THEO saved ground and failed to menace.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
APPALACHIANHEIGHTS settled in midpack early, moved out three wide approaching the top of the stretch, rallied determinedly outside LONDON LADY
through the furlong grounds, wrested command and edged clear. MORE GLORY broke a step slow, trailed well back for a half-mile, came four wide off the
turn and rallied on the far outside to get up for the place. LONDON LADY pressed WITH LIBERTY from outside early, took over soon after completing a
half-mile, edged clear through upper stretch, then drifted out and weakened through the late stages. GRANDMA'S PUDDING was put to a drive midway on
the turn three then four wide, and lacked a solid response. PRINCESS LEAN was no factor two wide. QUEEN CUPID raced out of contention three wide.
WITH LIBERTY was edgy in the gate prior to the start, hustled to the front early inside, could not hold off LONDON LADY after a half, and gave way.
DOMORE broke slowly and was never close. SOUTH PACIFIC was finished early three wide.

BUNNYNOTBEAST tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained through the lane, was up late and inched ahead. KINGSTON QUEEN pressed the pace two
wide, briefly led between foes near the sixteenth pole, switched back to the left lead and was outfinished. WHATS GOIN ON set a pressured pace inside to
the sixteenth pole and yielded. HARD TO CAPTURE raced off the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. PRONTA chased the pace three wide and
came up empty in the lane. HIGH ARABIAN played no factor while racing four wide. MUGURUZA was outrun inside. WOW TAPIT had early speed inside
and retreated nearing the lane.

TIZ ROMANTIC contested the pace outside FROSTED AMOUR, got the best of that dispute with a furlong remaining and kicked clear with some authority.
FROSTED ARMOUR dueled inside TIZ ROMANTIC to midstretch, proved no match from there and held for the place. PERFECT PICTURE raced close up
toward the inside to the stretch, and had no closing bid while best of the others. THING was no threat three wide. PUNX was bottled up in the two-path
heading into the turn, steadied getting shuffled back soon after, and remained out of contention. WOW RUN raced four wide in range for three furlongs, had
the rider drop the crop approaching the top of the stretch, and faded. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE. FINAL TIME CHANGED
AND FRACTIONS ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
REPUBLIQUE settled just off the pace while racing three wide, rallied through the lane and was up in deep stretch. SADIE BEAR pressed the pace two
wide, took the lead in midstretch but could not withstand the winner late. FULTON MARKET set a pressured pace inside, weakened in the lane but held
clear of the rest. QUEEN MACHA lunged at the start, raced off the pace four wide and had a mild rally outside. GLEAMING BRUTALITY chased the pace
just inside of the winner and lacked a closing bid. CUPID AUSTIN failed to menace while racing three wide. YOUR INHERITANCE was off a step slow,
raced two wide and never threatened. SOMEBODY LOVES ME played no factor while racing two wide. FROSTY SECRET was outrun inside. THIS RACE
WAS HAND-TIMED. FINAL TIME CHANGED AND FRACTIONS ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
