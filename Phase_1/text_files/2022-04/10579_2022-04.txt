Footnotes
ALPHA MIA was with the pace three wide and made a three wide bid leaving the turn and drew out in the final furlong to prove much the best under mild
urging. ROOKIE COURT vied for the early lead and set a pressured pace on the inside on the turn and could not go with the winner in the furlong grounds
but stayed on to be clearly second best. READY TO RUMBLE pressed the early pace on the inside, then shifted out leaving the turn and faded, bested rest.
VENENOSA was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and angled out in the drive and passed the tiring rivals. COSMIC SHOT was away alertly
and broke outwardly, stalked the pace four wide and weakened. SMART ANALYZER was bumped at the start, then was rated along and was two wide on
the turn and had no rally.

ENTRY TO HEAVEN was hard held early and well rated, ran between rivals at the five sixteenths, made a four wide move leaving the quarter pole and drew
clear in the stretch to prove much the best under left handed crop urging. BOKERMIN stalked the early pace two wide, made a three wide bid leaving the
quarter pole but proved to be no match for the winner while being clearly second best. BREATHLESSNTHESAND set the pace on the inside while being
well handled and was headed by the three sixteenths and weakened. QIAN B C was off slowly, then sent up the inside and tracked the pace on the inside,
was boxed on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had no kick. BOSSALINA was rated along three wide and then was four wide by the quarter
pole and came up empty.
