SECRET CASTLE settled close inside on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, closed to the front three wide approaching the five sxiteenths,
raced at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the stretch. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS rounded the opening turn about the four path then stalked
into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn, though settled for second best. SPUNKY ALI CAT was hustled
inside and took the lead into the first turn, dug in to the challenge of Vingage Gin from the half mile pole, bested that one toward the five sixteenths but
flattened at the rail on the far turn. TINA'S SONG was shuffled back at the start and raced well back in the three path the first turn, then bid only mildly to
pass rivals. VINTAGE GIN broke inward then stalked two deep, moved to even terms leaving the first turn, gave chase from that point but faded past the five
sixteenths pole. LIL MISS FIBER raced off the pace about the three path the first turn and showed little response.

GIGGING settled off the pace toward the inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, left the turn outside, dug in
for the lead later yards and raced clear toward the wire. SHERIFF CHIP took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and rated the pace inside, came under
pressure at the three eighths pole, had the advantage into the far turn, was met at the rail midway through the turn and dug in gamely through the stretch,
was caught in later yards, though managed to keep the nod for second. JAMMIN JIMTOWN stalked from the three path then challenged at the three eighths
pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dueled gamely from the head of the lane but missed the nod for second. SHAMELESS
RISK stalked inside, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole, drew to even terms three wide midway on the far turn, and while game through the stretch,
was outfinished. GEMS MINESHAFT RVF was through early.

but was caught in late yards. COUSIN WINNIE gave chase, raced in the three path of the turn and finished well. DENALI D'ORO chased, raced off the rail
on the turn and finished evenly. STROLLING THROUGH pressured the pace, dropped back between horses at the quarter pole, raced near the rail on the

angled four wide into the stretch and dug in under steady encouragement to get up the final yards. COURAGEOUS GRACE rated close inside, bid at the
three eighths pole and came between horses midway on the far turn, dueled to a slim lead in the upper stretch, was outfinished in the final yards but kept
the nod for second. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, contested the turn at a close disadvantage while three
wide, dueled gamely through the stretch, though, missed the nod for second. TONALA saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the turn near the rail, eased outward through the stretch and finished well. ANCHOR'S FIRSTLADY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure
nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, was caught past the eighth pole then flattened the final sixteenth. WILD CAPPUCINO
