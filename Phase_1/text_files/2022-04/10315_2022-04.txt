Footnotes
BROTHER AARON back off the issue early, in the two path when heading up the second flight through the turn, shifted out a bit for the stretch, set down
and kept coming on the outside to be up in time. TORIN broke alertly, set the pace up the backstretch toward the inside, dueled into the stretch in the two
path, long drive, led late, nipped late, game second. MAJOR ATTRACTION pressed the runner up outside that up the backstretch, dueled through the turn
and into the stretch, had a head in front past the furlong marker, also failed to contain the winner late, outkicked for the place. RIVER FINN broke back,
moved up into contention three wide by late on the backstretch, began to weaken n the turn. GAINER fell back to trail after the start, raced back and four
wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. SUPER WISE off a step slow, was finished early.

Footnotes
LUCKS BIG BOY broke on top, set a lively pace in the two path, continued to hold a sizable advantage into and through the final turn, remained clear
through the late while steadily being kept to task the final furlong. JACKS SPRING BREAK allowed the pace to go early, advanced three wide into the
second flight turning for home, slowly getting to the winner late while clear for the place. TAPPED OUT headed up the second flight while along the inside,
continued to pursue the winner while saving ground the middle half, had little for that one or the runner up through the stretch, comfortably saved the show.
SLIGHTLY CRAFTY broke back, lacked early speed toward the inside, began a mild advance far turn, steered out three wide late in that bend then slowly
improved position without posing a serious threat. BOTANY in the second group while racing outside, came between horses into the lane, had little left for
the stretch run. CYBERTOWN ibn the second flight while between horses, faltered in the drive. RIANTE SKY last to leave, trailed most of the way to be
always outrun. MOONSHINE VISION was finished after a half.

Footnotes
ZMUDA broke well allowed the speed to go early, patiently handled while saving ground through the turn, closer along the inside upper stretch, challenged
along the rail past the furlong marker, proved best under firm handling. MIDDIE moved up steadily after the start to duel into the turn, showed the way into
the lane, allowed the winner the inside in midstretch then gave ground grudgingly to that rival the final furlong. CALL KRYSTAL behind the pace while racing
outside, moved closer while still hand late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance in flattening out through the stretch. FARASINO last away, raced back
and just off the inside, never dangerous through the lane in lacking a significant closing response. QUE PASA MUFASA broke out, was straightened to duel
up front outside the runner up, faltered after a half. REALLY NICE sluggish after the start in quickly falling back, pulled up turn, vanned off.

Footnotes
INVALUABLE broke on top, narrowly set the pace up the backstretch and into turn turn in hand, shook off a foe turning for home, drew off under a steady
hand ride to win ridden out. LIL MISS HOT MESS fell back after breaking in good order, pulled, closer in some traffic late in the turn, steered out for the
drive, proved no match for the winner, edged clear for the place. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR forwardly placed while three wide and between foes into the turn,
went evenly through the lane. FLATOUTANDFOXY within striking distance outside, four wide into the turn, began to give way soon after, continued to falter
while three wide into the lane. DARING broke back, remained back in failing to menace. KAY BEE GEE last to leave, moved up steadily toward the inside,
challenged outside the winner through the bend then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
VISION OF ELIAS never far back while off the inside, advanced and challenged outside the leader late in the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch,
shook well clear by the furlong marker, enough left to hold the runner up safe. WARNING LABEL settled behind the pace toward the inside, bit closer into
the turn, came three wide into the lane when set down, steadily getting to the winner while too late, well clear of the others. BACKGATE RED lacked early
foot, roused three wide turning into the lane, staged a mild rally while not a threat to the top two. MOONSHINE SURFER dwelt at the start to spot the field
several lengths, trailed well back, saved ground through the turn. JACKYS BACK lacked early foot, raced back and inside, picked off a few tiring rivals while
not a serious threat. YOUNG O' DAINE forwardly placed early along the inside after breaking in good order, firm restraint, steadied with a half mile
remaining, began to weaken early in the drive. OTHER TIMES off a step slow, was never a threat. JUSTDENNIS in mid pack and off the inside, raced three
wide through most of the turn, tired in the drive. COINCIDENTAL showed the way up the backstretch inside, offered but brief resistance to the winner exiting
the turn, stopped.

Footnotes
RUGGS broke well, pressed the issue through the first turn in hand, continued to apply pressure in hand up the backstretch, challenged midway on the final
turn, took over, clear when straightened for home, drifted in slightly under a right handed crop with a sixteenth remaining, continued to draw away.
STELLAR TAP unhurried toward the inside early, encountered traffic late in the final turn, steered three wide, up late for the place while between horses at
the wire. NINETIES COUNTRY last away, recovered, forwardly placed while three wide, asked along in the three path when moving with the winner through
the second turn, proved no match for that one, outkicked for the second spot while widest of the second flight at the wire. MAGOO pulled early when racing
within striking distance inside of traffic first turn, continued inside, got through along a clean rail to briefly challenge in upper stretch then faltered late.
CLANCY'S PISTOL four wide when in the first turn when within striking distance, continued outside, lacked rally. CONCEPT set the pace inside, offered
brief resistance to the winner when that one challenged midway on the final turn, gave way soon after when headed.

Footnotes
STRIKE A BEAT allowed the pace to go early in hand, remained back in the run up the backstretch, launched a sudden move three to four wide far turn,
quickly gained command and drew clear, kept to task. CHASE TRACKER tracked the early pace along the inside through the first turn, moved out and
raced three wide into the far turn when moving to the front, was quickly overtaken by the winner midway on that bend, dueled for the second spot behind
that one into the lane, clear second, no match. OUTCOME broke on top, dueled up front along the inside, also proved no match for the winner in the drive,
could not match the runner up late, narrowly saved the show. TURN THE SWITCH last away, lacked speed off the inside, three wide through the second
bend, staged a mild rally outside to narrowly miss the show. DOC IRWIN lacked speed while racing off the inside, failed to muster a rally. RECKLESSNESS
four wide through the first turn, void of early foot, remained back in also lacking a rally. ALPINE GHOST dueled up front off the inside, first to blink, stopped
through the lane.

Footnotes
MARACUJA last away, continued unhurried up the backstretch, advanced four wide midway on the final turn, lost some ground to the leader into the lane,
engaged that one inside the furlong marker and wore that same rival down under firm handling. LIL KINGS PRINCESS moved up after the start to show the
way into and through the first turn toward the inside, set a lively set of fractions, continued to be clear into the lane, was slow to yield to the winner in the late
going while maintaining the second slot. MISS IMPERIAL broke on top, chased the winner while racing off the inside, closer, outkicked for the second spot
in the late going. BOW BOW GIRL lacked speed, improved while saving ground inside of rivals in the second turn, flattened out through the stretch.
TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN never menaced while racing off the inside. W W FITZY saved ground, stopped late in the final turn and was eased through the
stretch.

Footnotes
ROCK STAR PARKING in the second flight along inside, in some traffic through the turn in hand, advanced, challenged along the rail with a furlong
remaining, drew clear under steady handling. NIC AND ZOE outbroke trouble to her outside, set the pace toward the inside, continued to hold the
advantage upper stretch, allowed the winner the inside soon after, no match, clearly second best. NISI PRIUS bore out early bothering outside rivals, was
straightened to race forwardly and off the inside, could not keep pace with the top two in the drive, came back for the show. AIRBORNE GAL bothered just
after the break, raced forwardly up the backstretch, remained prominent three wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. SLUSHY bothered soon after
the break, raced back and off the inside, improved slightly while not a serious threat. MISS YUM YUM bothered soon after the start, trailed early, improved
into the lane, flattened out in the drive. KNIGHT'S HONOR floated out just after the break, remained always back. CHAKRA rank to be off slow then
steadied with inside pressure, recovered to move up four wide, gave way in the turn, trailed home.
