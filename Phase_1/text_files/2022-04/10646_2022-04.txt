Footnotes
HONESTO raced off the pace four wide, rallied outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. ROCK SOLID WORDS stumbled at the
start, pressed the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, reached even terms between foes near the sixteenth pole but was no match for the
winner from there. FULL OF MISCHIEF lacked early speed, raced three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied outside to
gain the show late. SNOW JOB bumped with INDOMITO at the start, set the pace along the rail to the sixteenth pole and weakened. CAN'T BE BROKEN
failed to menace while racing four wide. JOYFUL SURPRISE came in and bumped J P CORNETTA at the start, chased the pace two and three wide and
faded in the final furlong. J P CORNETTA was bumped and shut off at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. JIMMY'S MISTRESS stalked the
pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. MINDSHIP Q chased the pace from the rail and tired in the drive. INDOMITO broke awkwardly and
bumped at the start, raced two wide and made little further impact. CAYO COSTA failed to menace while racing two wide. SUNSPOT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
FUERTEVENTURA brushed with EUPHORIA STAR after the break, saved ground in easy striking range to the stretch, tipped to the two-path once
straightened away, caught VALIANT AVENGER from outside a sixteenth out and moved away under good handling. VALIANT AVENGER set the pace
inside, could not withstand the top one late, but remained well clear of the rest. GRAN ANDREWS swung four wide coming off the far turn, moved into third
through the furlong grounds and finished up evenly. DANIEL SUN chased the pacesetter two wide, came under a ride on the far turn, and faded in the
stretch. EUPHORIA STAR brushed with the eventual winner after the start, saved ground early, shifted five wide nearing the stretch and made no advances.
LUCAGO chased three wide for six furlongs, and weakened. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

HEY HOMBRE set the pace in the two path, kicked clear midway around the turn and held safe under a drive. CIANGO tracked the pace three wide, had
aim outside of the winner through the lane but could only make a mild gain. COMPASS CAY saved ground off the pace, tipped out nearing the lane and was
along for the show. EXTRACTION WILL pressed the winner in the three path, angled in when unable to keep pace with that foe nearing the five-sixteenths
pole and faded. ALL FOR GOLD failed to menace while racing two wide. GREEN DOT BRAH had some speed four wide, retreated through the lane and
was vanned off. PEMBERTON was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
LONG BEACH KID saved ground allowed to settle early, moved out four wide getting in gear after six furlongs, rallied steadily outside rivals through the
stretch and edged away in the closing stages on his left lead. MISTER LEONARDO advanced four wide approaching the stretch, rallied to a short lead
through midstretch, but could not hold off the top one. POCO CHARLIE was held up early and three wide coming off the first turn, stayed outside throughout
and rallied mildly to get up for the show. PAPA HONOR was strung out four wide on the first turn, remained widest up the backstretch, lodged a bid on the
far turn shifting inward a path or two, stayed on to midstretch and weakened. FARLEY pressed the early pace outside MYSTERY BANK, took over after six
furlongs moving to the rail, and weakened through the last eighth of a mile. UHTRED was hard held early inside, checked sharply unable to maintain
position between horses midway on the far turn, and gave way. MYSTERY BANK set a slow early pace in the two-path, and was finished before reaching
the stretch.

Footnotes
TAPE TO TAPE was bumped at the start, sped the front, set the pace just off the rail and drew off under a drive in the lane. MILITARY DRILL stalked the
pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. ENSIGN PARKER steadied near the half-mile pole, saved ground off the
pace and ran on to gain the show. HENRY'S WORLD tossed his head at the start and bumped the winner then TRINNI SUMMER soon after, checked not
long after, raced off the pace three wide, angled widest in upper stretch, continued on this left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. TRINNI
SUMMER was bumped soon after the start, chased the pace three wide and faded through the lane. ZANNO pressed the pace three wide and tired in the
drive. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

KENYA SUN took a short early lead, edged away from a host of pursuers in the two-path after a half-mile, stayed on task and remained clear late. GONE
TO CABO was held up behind the first flight on the turn two wide, tipped to the three-path with a clear shot at the leader into the stretch, but did not have
enough while much best of the others. AWESOME APEAL chased inside early, and drifted out in the stretch on her left lead. LADY MECHANIC raced four
to five wide on the turn, and faded in the stretch. MISS BETH'EL swung five wide coming off the turn, and could not reach contention. DOLCISIMA fanned
six wide at the back leaving the turn, and made no impact. ADIOS DIXIE chased three wide between horses for a half-mile, and tired. UNBRIDLED
CHROME was no factor inside. CHEVELITA raced three to four wide, and tired after a half.

Footnotes
CATTIN prompted the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear soon after, angled in turning for home and held clear under a
drive. CYBERVIKING tracked the pace from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and narrowed the gap. STEAL SUNSHINE raced off the pace four wide and
ran on for the show. STORMY PATTERN pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. GOD IS LOVE never threatened while racing two wide.
RUSSIAN TO WIN set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing the quarter pole.

Footnotes
MABEE LUCKYNWILD sped clear early, showed the way in the two-path before moving in at the top of the stretch, and was kept busy to the finish.
RUBYSA pressed the pace early inside, moved out three wide for clearance turning for home, and could not seriously threaten the winner while best of the
others. STARSHIP NUGGET bumped lightly with STACIAS RUBY at the start, was outrun early, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly to take the
show clearly. PEARLINTHEROUGH posed no threat two to three wide. STACIAS RUBY bumped lightly with STARSHIP NUGGET at the start, came four
wide off the turn and could not reach contention. SADE PURSE bumped lightly with WIN OR CELLAR at the start, advanced a bit after a half-mile while
shifting out four wide, then flattened out in the stretch. WIN OR CELLAR bumped lightly with SADE PURSE at the start, and faded steadily toward the
inside. MANUELA was always outrun. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY raced close up three wide for a half, and tired. SCARLETT'S FLOWER was through early
inside.

Footnotes
THE DISTRACTOR hit the starting gate to get away last, raced well back four wide, closed outside and was up late. SEPTEMBERTEN trailed inside for a
half, got through at the rail in upper stretch, bid inside of foes leaving the eighth pole and was narrowly outkicked. POPPY'S PRIDE set the pace outside,
drew clear in the two path around the turn, led past the eighth pole and yielded late. PICKING UP PENNIES was bounced around between foes down the
backstretch, steadied leaving the half-mile pole, raced in range three wide around the turn, bid between foes in midstretch but flattened out late. VINNIE
VAN GO bumped PICKING UP PENNIES early, disputed the pace from the rail, could not quite keep pace around the turn, angled two wide near the quarter
pole and faltered in the lane. BIG DADDY DAVE bumped repeatedly with PICKING UP PENNIES down the backstretch, raced off the pace three wide
around the turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SENOR JOBIM broke slowly and was outrun through the opening half-mile, shifted out four wide beginning to find stride coming off the turn, kicked in
leaving the eighth-pole and wore down KING CAB from outside. KING CAB sped clear soon after the start, showed the way inside to the stretch, drifted out
on his left lead and could not hang on. REAL TALK was urged along in pursuit of the pacesetter to the turn, entered the lane three wide and lacked a closing
response. ROUGH ENTRY raced four wide around the turn, and had no rally. WELL DEFINED moved inward around the turn, and could not keep pace
through the lane. GOLDEN JUAN was never prominent. IT'S MY HOUSE showed little at the back. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GONNA BE EPIC settled off the pace while racing three wide, remained well back while two wide between foes rounding the far turn, kicked in nearing the
eighth pole, closed between foes and was up late. ANOTHER DUKE steadied early, raced off the pace three wide, angled in in upper stretch, closed inside,
reached even terms in deep stretch and was narrowly outkicked. DRUM AND DRUMMER set the pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. KICK IN
THE GAS prompted the pace three wide, kept trying outside but was outfinished. SONIC KITTEN raced in range two and three wide, angled widest in upper
stretch and had a mild rally. BACH chased the pace two and three wide between foes and lacked the needed rally. CARIBBEAN GOLD hesitated at the
start, raced four wide around both turns and never threatened. UNIMPEACHED had speed inside and faltered nearing the lane. ORIENTAL PARK had his
head turned at the start, raced five wide and made little impact. VOLTE FACE was outrun inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
