Footnotes
MADELYNS HEAT trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up while racing in the three path around
the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch, quickly took command and drew off to the wire, much the best. TEA AFTER BALLET saved ground around the
first turn, raced up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, continued to save ground around the far turn and chased the eventual winner
home from there, no match for that rival. KING ZION saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
outside, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the winner. OFF TO THE BEACH
raced in the two and three path around the first turn, dropped back to trail the field on the outside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the two path
around the second turn, swung out to the middle of the track entering the stretch and made no bid. SWEET TONIC was urged to an early lead while racing
in the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way while racing inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, tired entering the stretch and
was eased late.

Footnotes
COMFORT ME NOW tracked well off the leader through the clubhouse turn, began to edge closer past the seven sixteenths, engaged outside of FAST
ONE while racing two wide on the far turn, headed the pacesetter near the five sixteenths while running within himself, cleared in upper stretch and drew
further off under a moderate hand ride through the final furlong. IRISH MAJOR chased inside of DOM CAETANO (ARG), continued well behind the leading
pair while racing along the rail on the far turn, went to a drive approaching the three sixteenths, passed outside of the fading FAST ONE and kept on in the
lane to prove best of the rest. ROAR OF THE LION soon trailed, regained touch with the chasing flight into the far turn, chased three wide around that bend,
swung into the seven path in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses under a drive to capture the show. FAST ONE was anxious in the gate, cleared while
racing keenly early, continued on a clear lead down the back straight, was pressured by COMFORT ME NOW to his outside around the far turn, lost the
lead to that foe near the five sixteenths, was no match for that foe from the three sixteenths and weakened inside. DOM CAETANO (ARG) chased two wide,
continued between horses on the far turn while well behind the leading pair, chased on with the rear group to midstretch but came up empty and was not
persevered with late.

Footnotes
WEEKEND PASS trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to race inside around the far turn, launched a
bid from the rail passing the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to the wire to pull clear late. BELLS OF JOY led the field from the three path around the
first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground while dueling around the far turn in upper stretch and was caught in the final sixteenth of a mile
while finishing evenly. HARD LIKE HOLLY raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid
from the two path approaching the far turn, dueled down the lane and weakened late. NEW CHINA saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up
the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, offered a mild bid nearing the quarter pole and was outkicked from there. AMARI S. raced in the
two path around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and was outkicked in the
stretch. PIPPITY DO DA raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving
ground around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

horses into the far turn, edged to the lead past the three eighths, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, veered out midstretch and subsequently drew off
to prove clearly best. SATIATE was sent to the early lead inside, took pressure through the clubhouse turn from ON A TOUR and WATCHING THE
WHEELS to her outside, vied inside of those foes down the back straight and into the far turn, tracked inside past the three eighths when ON A TOUR
asserted herself on the lead, was driven inside into the lane, proved no match from the three sixteenths and chased on second best. WATCHIN THE
WHEELS attended the pace three wide through the clubhouse turn, vied three wide into the backstretch, tracked three wide on the far turn as ON A TOUR
edged to a defined lead to his inside, swung five wide into the lane for the drive, and was outfinished for the place. IRISH HALO tracked the leading flight
inside around the clubhouse turn, chased well off the leading line down the back straight, saved ground around the far turn while racing inside of DARING
DAMSEL, and lacked the needed kick while driven in the lane. DARING DAMSEL settled well behind the main group, improved slightly to join IRISH HALO
on the far turn to chase two wide, swung six wide into the lane and lacked the needed rally. LITTLE CHICK soon trailed, went to a brief drive near the five
eighths but offered no response, saved ground through the far turn, was driven again in the two to three path in upper stretch, and offered no bid.

PACHI led the field on the inside, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held his margin to the wire under a drive. NYOMAN
pressed the pace from the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn, and chased the winner home, the best of the
rest. THE LAST OPTION trailed the field on the inside in the early going, began to improve position while racing in the two and three path around the turn,
and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the top two. BORA BORA raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the two path and came up empty in the stretch while drifting in in the final furlong. MR. LUV MAKER raced between horses in the middle of the pack in the
early going, began to drop back back while saving ground around the turn and tired further from there.

BIG SPORT soon led, raced keenly into the turn while still on the lead, set the pace in the four to five path on the turn, and drifted out slightly while finding
enough to maintain his advantage under a mild hand ride down the lane. TWIRLING ROSES was in a bit tight in the opening strides due to SMUGGLER'S
GHOST breaking inward, tracked the leader three wide between horses in the first furlong, shook ahead to the tracking flight inside of GOLDENPENCE past
the five eighths, was pushed along into the turn, tracked the leading pair in the two path, bid inside into the lane, loomed inside of BIG SPORT in upper
stretch, and chased on without finding enough under a drive to reel in the leader. SMUGGLER'S GHOST broke outward, chased between horses in the
opening furlong, settled back past the five eighths, chased in the five path on the turn and four wide into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, and
chased on evenly for show. NIGHT THINGS settled at the rear, took mildly closer order in the six path on the turn, came six wide into the lane and could not
sustain a rally down the lane. GOLDENPENCE broke outward, tracked four deep early, shook ahead to the tracking flight outside of TWIRLING ROSES
past the five eighths, cleared TWIRLING ROSES into the turn and tracked BIG SPORT in the five path, raced three wide into the lane, proved no match for
BIG SPORT and TWIRLING ROSES from upper stretch and weakened. Z U SOON chased inside foes early, began to lose position from the nine
sixteenths, was outpaced into the turn, raced in the four path around the bend, was driven three wide in upper stretch and offered no bid.

Footnotes
AVASARALA dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, showed the way from the two path around the turn, turned back a challenger in upper
stretch and prevailed to the wire. STORMY EMPIRE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, offered a
bid passing the quarter pole, was turned back by the winner in upper stretch and chased that rival home, second best. LONG TALL WOMAN hopped up
leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly while no match
for the top two. SHE'S A BIG STAR trailed far behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses between rivals in
the stretch. NIFF pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the final
furlong. STACY ATTACK tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and flattened out in late stretch.
RANK AND FILE hit the gate leaving it, dueled on the outside and then between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around
the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
HATCHET CREEK chased outside DAY IN THE COUNTRY early, inched forward from the nine sixteenths, tracked the leader two wide on the turn,
responded when driven four wide into the lane, took the lead at the three sixteenths and drove clear in the final furlong. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ was
reluctant to load and anxious in the gate, broke out and bumped MANGO TREE in the opening strides, set the pace down the backstretch and while saving
ground around the turn, was driven three wide on a narrow lead in upper stretch, lost the lead to HATCHET CREEK at the three sixteenths, and chased on
second best from there. CHANGE DIRECTION was shut off in the opening strides as a result of MIND YOUR OWN BIZ breaking inward, settled outside of
FINAL CALL in the rear flight, was driven in the four path on the turn and six wide into the lane, and chased on willingly to gain the show. MANGO TREE
was bumped by MIND YOUR OWN BIZ in the opening strides, settled well behind the main group down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn,
turned for home four wide between horses, and chased on mildly past tiring horses four wide. FINAL CALL settled at the inside of the rear flight, raced in the
two path on the turn, was driven in the two path into the lane, regained touch with the rear of the main pack in upper stretch but lacked a late kick between
horses. PO BOY tracked inside down the backstretch, hugged the rail while chasing the leading pair around the turn, was in range inside to upper stretch,
but weakened in the final furlong. DAY IN THE COUNTRY chased inside of HATCHET CREEK early, chased at the rear of the main group three wide on the
turn, swung into the lane five wide, proved no match from the three sixteenths, and weakened three wide.
