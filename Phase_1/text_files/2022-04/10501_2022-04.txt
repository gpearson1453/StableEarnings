ASTRONOMICAL sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch and drew off through the final
yards. SEBASTIAN'S BOY was away alertly to race closest to the winner throughout, moved four-wide through the second turn, was no match for that rival
in the drive but finished well to regain the place. JACKS OUTLAW lugged out through the first turn, moved up from the inside to offer a bid nearing the
quarter, reached a striking position but failed to sustain his rally. PERFECT WAGER was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn
and gave way in the drive. TIZONA was carried out through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

the winner late. ELLIE CAN PLAY set a pressured pace while racing three-wide and gave way late. ROSES FOR SUZZETT settled off the leaders early,

Footnotes
MISS REBEKAH was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command with a sixteenth to run and drew clear.
PAYNT THE KITTY was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and rallied late. KEEPONROCKINMEBABY
disputed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way late. SUCH A LADY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with
a belated bid. TAHOE BLUE was forwardly placed early from off the rail and gave way in the drive. LIL' MISS MISCHIEF dueled for the lead while racing
three-wide and gave way through the final furlong. MISYA GIRL lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SNOOZY SUZY
was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. WUMPMUG raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn,
angled out into the stretch and weakened. SHESLITTLEMISCHIEF lagged throughout.
