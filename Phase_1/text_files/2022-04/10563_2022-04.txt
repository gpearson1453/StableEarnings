Footnotes
VERDEJO was well placed on the inside, shifted out three wide by the three sixteenths marker to make a bid, drew away in the furlong grounds to prove
much the best under mild right handed crop urging. SPEED CHESS prompted the pace three wide, made a two wide bid leaving the turn but proved to be
no match for the winner while clearly second best. SPICE IN YUH LIFE chased the pace and was two wide on the turn, eased out and came four wide into
the drive and finished willingly to best the rest. CRIMSON SKY was away alertly to set the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. LITTLE FIRE was
settled two wide and came three wide into the drive and had no rally. FORMENTOR was off slowly, then raced on the inside and was not a threat.

HIDDEN HONOR was settled early, then shifted to the outside and advanced five wide on the turn, came six wide into the lane and closed well to draw
away under a drive. DAY TRIPPER was rated along early, made a five wide move nearing the quarter pole and vied for command by the furlong marker but
could not go with the winner late, second best. MR. DE chased the pace and raced on the inside on the turn and was up for the show award on the inside.
MENTORING was off a step slow, advanced between horses and made a three wide bid on the turn to vie for command, but faded the final furlong. CITRUS
BOY was bumped at the start, settled back early, advanced four wide on the turn and had a belated rally. MIDNIGHT ARKLE stalked the pace and made a
four wide bid on the turn but weakened. STYLISH GENT vied for the early lead three wide and then went on to set the pace and drop down to the inside,
dueled for command by the quarter pole and faltered in the drive. BROADWAY SKY failed to menace. UNDER SURVEILLANCE vied for the early lead on
the inside and stopped.

ELEKTRONIC rushed up the inside and set the pace in the two path, shook clear leaving the turn and then dug in and held on gamely to prove best under a
drive. FIELDER pressed the early pace on the inside, then was rated off the pace on the inside on the turn, was boxed by the quarter pole, tipped out three
wide for aim on the front runner, closed well to just miss. RECONFIGURE stalked the pace four wide but lacked the needed stretch bid, held show award.
SOUPER SUCCESS was rated along between rivals, swung out five wide for the drive and had a belated rally. WESTERN TROUBLE chased the pace on
the inside and swung out three wide leaving the turn and had no kick. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS was off slowly andf settled in the back early, then had no
significant rally. ALACRITOUS pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened. DYNAMITE KARMA chased the pace and was
four wide on the turn and weakened.

DIRTY DANGLE stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid in hand leaving the quarter pole, kicked clear when asked to prove best. MILLENNIUM
FORCE was rated between horses, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and finished willingly but proved to be no match to the winner but clearly second
best. SPANISH BALLERINA was well placed on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive and faded, bested rest. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE chased the
pace four wide and came five wide into the drive and had no rally. ROMAN D'ORO was settled early and came five wide into the drive and had no rally.
SPARKLE SAMMY set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. DANCING DOLL was rated on the inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
JOIN THE DANCE set the early pace and drew out on the turn, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. HAI BOBBI was bumped at the start, settled
on the inside, advanced on the turn towards the inside, tipped out three wide leaving the turn and continued that move to be slowly gaining late but could not
get to the winner late, second best. LUZ DE LA LUNA chased the early pace and came three wide into the drive and finished evenly, bested rest. BAYOU
BELLE was rated along three to four wide and lacked a rally. SILVER MAGNATIZED tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. STARLIGHT RIDGE
stalked the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
HIGH SOCIETY GIRL dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid to shake clear on the turn and drew out in the drive to prove much the best under
mild urging. LACOUGRA dueled for the lead on the inside and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. STUNNING
RIVERS was bumped at the start, settled on the inside, advanced on the turn and was blocked by the quarter pole, then was up for the show award on the
inside late. CORA was well placed on the inside and lacked the needed stretch bid, lost show award late. ROYAL CITY REIGN was settled early while four
wide, came five wide into the lane and had no kick. SHISHKA tracked the pace in between rivals and came up empty in the drive. LET'S HAVE FUN chased
the early pace and was five wide on the turn and weakened. PALIO SIENA was reserved early, came widest into the lane and had no rally. SPEEDY FIRE
failed to menace. MALICIOSA was not a factor. FLAWLESS PINK settled and was four wide on the turn and stopped.
