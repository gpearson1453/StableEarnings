STORMY BONNIE was well placed early on the inside, then split rivals nearing the seven sixteenths to vie for command, then set a pressured pace on the
turn while dropping to the inside, then had a long drive with PASSWORD PROTECTED and held gamely to prove best under a drive. PASSWORD
PROTECTED stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to press the pace three wide leaving the turn, then went on even terms for
command by the furlong marker, then hung late while being outfinished to just miss. SCARY LARRY was allowed to settle early, advanced two wide on the
turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished well. PEACE ATTARDI set the pace on the inside and weakened. SPOOKY ONE chased the pace
four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
RAISETONEW HEIGHTS was well placed on the inside, shifted out four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive, closed full of run to hit the front
in deep stretch and edge away under a drive. BIRD TRAFFIC stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn and drew clear leaving the turn
but was caught in deep stretch, second best. TEACHER DRAMA was allowed to settle early, then was bumped at the half mile marker, shifted to the inside
on the turn, swung out three wide for the drive and had a late rally to gain the show award. MISS MORENO was rated along early, made a three wide bid on
the turn but flattened out. EARLY FROST was allowed to settle early, angled out at the half mile marker, made a four wide bid on the turn but came up
empty in the drive. BEST CAUSE set the pace on the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
WAVERLY SUNSET stalked the early pace three wide, made a bid on the turn to press the pace by the quarter pole, then was carried out wide leaving the
turn, then drew clear in the drive to prove best, driving. MELODIOUS SINGER set the early pace on the inside, then drifted out leaving the turn, could not go
with the winner late, second best. TIZ PROMISING RVF was taken back early, then saved ground on the turn, angled out in the drive and had a belated
rally for the show reward. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT was reserved early, swung out five wide for the drive and passed the tiring rivals. MARIE FROM
PARIE broke in a tangle at the start, advanced four wide on the turn and then weakened. SILENT FLUIDITY tracked the early pace on the inside and
weakened. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE was rated early and was in between rivals on the turn and weakened.
