Footnotes
SONIC KITTEN saved ground unhurried early, advanced under a ride four wide on the far turn, rallied steadily to reach the front leaving the furlong grounds
and drove clear. STOLEN MONEY prompted KOOSMAN from outside early, poked a head in front after six furlongs, came out impeding POETIC CODE
with an eighth of a mile remaining, and held for the place. POETIC CODE tugged along early behind the leaders, stayed close inside for six furlongs, was in
traffic still behind the leaders turning for home, checked behind STOLEN MONEY in midstretch, then regrouped and finished gamely between horses.
WIZARD SERRAT was four wide early before moving in a bit, lodged a mild bid after six furlongs, but could not sustain the rally. PATAGONIAN EMPIRE
was outrun to the stretch, altered course outside late and made no impression. KOOSMAN set the pace to the far turn, stayed on through upper stretch,
then gave way. ALABAMA JAMMA showed brief speed two wide, and tired. ONE MORE DAY was five wide into the first turn, and tired after six furlongs.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF POETIC CODE AGAINST STOLEN MONEY, THE LATTER WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH.

Footnotes
CAMPEADOR tracked the pace two wide between foes, angled four wide turning for home, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
HIGH YIELD KITTEN disputed the pace inside of PERSONAL MEADOW, drifted out a bit turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, led much
of the stretch but was no match for the winner in the final sixteenth. LUCKY AS A SEVEN tracked the pace from the rail, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth
pole and flattened out late. LOYAL LOUIE stalked the pace three wide between foes and lacked the needed rally. PERSONAL MEADOW set the pace two
wide to upper stretch and tired. SIR AGGRAVATOR chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. EMICRACK (CHI) trailed inside.

Footnotes
ROYAL KITTEN was ridden along the inside out of the gate and took over a slim lead after initial stages, set a pressured pace up the backstretch then
edged away to clearer lead around the turn, roused for more entering the lane, dug in three to four wide, repelled the bid from MOMZA with a furlong left to
run and held clear. MOMZA raced in range saving ground, rode the rail around the turn, launched a bid for ROYAL KITTEN at the head of the lane, roused
forward into close contention but could not reach the winner and had to settle for clearly second best. LORD DARNLEY chased up close through the
backstretch, flattened midway around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and churned on for a share. KICK IN THE GAS raced off the early pace, was
ridden along the outside into the lane and improved position without threatening. JEALOUS BOYFRIEND was forwardly placed prompting the early pace,
sustained a three wide bid around the turn then flattened out. POLITICAL RIOT raced outside in pursuit of the early leader, ran on three wide past the
quarter pole then gave way in the lane. MACEDONIAN was reserved racing widest in the early going, had no response and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
STAR WEAVER came away last and settled in the back although never too far from the frontend, picked up the pace three wide late on the turn, advanced
to challenge FRENCHMAN STREET for the lead in the upper stretch, matched strides with a furlong left to run edged away under left handed pressure.
FRENCHMEN STREET raced up close along the inside then sat just off the top pair upon entering the turn, roused forward three wide with a quarter mile
remaining, briefly held the lead then came under attack from the winner, fought back from the into the final furlong then got outfinished. RED MULE tracked
the early leaders and raced off the pressured top flight mid-way through the turn, given cue five wide turning for home, sustained steady response and
gathered a share. ROYAL SQUEEZE was prompted into a forward position in opening stages, raced in striking distance then got in tight two wide and
steadied sharply leaving the backstretch, moved back up to threaten rivals for the lead mid-way through the turn, sustained bid into the final furlong then
flattened out. SKY MAGICIAN raced up close then vied with EARTH around the turn, got overtaken leaving the turn and gave way a furlong out. EARTH
broke on top and held a slim lead through early stages, vied inside of SKY MAGICIAN around the turn, got overtaken turning for home and weakened in the
final furlong. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
FINANCIAL SYSTEM broke on top and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, took on the challenge from I"M A G SIX leaving the three eighths pole,
vied inside of rival through the turn, battled back gamely from the inside in the lane, edged ahead to a slim lead in late stages and held firm. I'M A G SIX
applied pace pressure to FINANCIAL SYSTEM up the backstretch, advanced to challenge for the lead leaving the three-eighths pole, continued to battle
heads apart into the lane and got denied in deep stretch. MR TITO'S tracked the top two leaders through early stages, launched an inside bid around the
turn, churned on through the lane and secured a share. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY was briefly edgy and popped open the gate without getting away, was
reserved two wide in the back, hustled along the outside into the turn, swung wide into the lane and improved position without threatening. STRIKE APPEAL
rated three to four wide in range up the backstretch, was ridden along three to four wide into the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally.

inside and got edged out for the win. ALPHA BABE rated three wide up the backstretch, circled up closer four wide past the quarter pole, came five wide
into the lane, gained close contention a furlong out, sustained steady response and gained a share. SERENADE A KITTEN raced two wide around the first
turn and stalked up the backstretch, moved up to challenge for command late on the far turn, dueled into the final furlong then faded late. MIDNIGHT BELLA
got pinched back a bit at the start and angled inside, settled while saving ground through early stages, launched a three to four wide bid into the upper
stretch and failed to move on. YOLANDA'S PRIDE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, edged away to the lead near the quarter pole, sustained bid
into upper stretch then came up empty. CENTSLESS DRAMA was off slow at the start, was reserved in the back, hustled along into the lane and failed to
respond. MADEIRA WINE pressed the pace around the first turn then took over the early lead, led the way into the far turn then got overtaken by

Footnotes
BLESSED JOURNEY was nicely rated while never too far off the early pace, came under a ride leaving the turn, prompted five wide at the head of the lane,
gathered momentum under steady pressure and got up in final strides. DEVOTED KITTEN raced in the back and widest up the backstretch, quickly
advanced late on the turn, challenged TONE FEELIN for the lead at the head of the lane, dueled gamely into the final furlong, shook free to a slim lead then
got denied approaching the wire. TONE FEELIN set the pace up the backstretch and continued to show the way around the turn, took on the challenge from
DEVOTED KITTEN at the head of the lane, fought back gamely into the final furlong, could not match strides with rival in deep stretch but stayed on for a
share. PLATO stalked up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn, continued a bid in range into late stages but lacked the needed kick
for serious impact. MALIBU MAX stalked the early pacesetter, hustled along going by the half mile marker, ran on through the turn then gave way. THE
MIGHTY JUDGE settled four to five paths wide in early stages, failed to progress under pressure around the turn and faded in the lane. DIZZY GILLESPIE
saved ground throughout and failed to move into contention. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CHASING ARTIE chased after the leader in early stages, moved up three wide to race in aim late on the turn, dueled for the lead with SHEKKY SHEBAZ
into the final furlong, dug in gamely, shook free and held firm. THE VIRGINIAN raced outside off the early speed, hustled up four wide into the upper stretch,
responded under firm handling and gained second best. SHEKKY SHEBAZ tracked inside in contention, moved up the rail late on the turn, dueled for the
lead with the winner into the final furlong then yielded. EMBOLDEN raced off the early pace, was ridden along four to five wide into the upper stretch and
lacked a rally. CITRUS BURST raced in the back, saved ground throughout and failed to respond. JACK AND NOAH (FR) quickly cleared the lead and led
the way into the turn, came under a hold late past the furlong marker, quickly dropped back and vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
LAMPLIGHTER JACK held a slim lead in the first turn then set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, roused two wide into the upper
stretch, responded, turned back bids and held clear. CONGLOMERATE stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a bid for command around the
far turn, sustained three wide bid in the stretch run and dug in to capture place. YAMATO tracked the pace along the inside, hustled along two wide at the
head of the lane, stayed on with response and got outdueled for place. KITTEN'S SPA settled through early stages, saved ground the far turn, tipped wider
for the drive, raced in range a furlong out but failed to move on. EMOJI GUY was unhurried through early stages, hustled up along the outside into the lane
and lacked a needed rally. SURF AND TURF raced near midpack three to four wide, was ridden along three wide through the turn then weakened in the
lane. CALORIC raced off the pace, saved ground and never threatened. STRIKE THE TOP raced near the back, retreated around the far turn, dropped far
back and jogged in.
