Footnotes
STREAKING GREY broke a bit awkwardly, sped to the front two wide around the first turn, cleared off and angled in early on the backstretch, set the pace
along the rail from there, repulsed a bid from WHAT KNOT in midstretch and was going away again late. WHAT KNOT raced in range four wide around the
first turn, advanced outside down the backstretch, edged closer three wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was
turned back and losing ground late. CALI DIVINE led along the rail early, was content to settled into a stalking position when the winner was intent on the
lead around the first turn, stalked two wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, could not keep pace with the top two but held off a host
of challengers for the show late. CAPETOWN CANDY saved ground off the pace, stayed at the rail in the lane and improved position. ARETE'S CHALICE
raced off the early pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn but faded in the stretch. COUNTESSOFLOVELACE failed to menace while racing
two and three wide. TOUCH OF LOVE stalked the pace three wide early, chased two wide between foes around the far turn and weakened in the drive.
MISS YOUNIVERSE played no factor while racing two wide. HOLIDAY PRINCESS saved ground to no avail. MORENA DANCER was outrun inside.
STEPSTONES hopped at the start, quickly moved forward and angled in nearing the turn to race in range inside but came up empty in the lane. FEEL LIKE
GUESSING steadied entering the first and made little impact while racing three and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

FOREST SURVIVOR vied outside GRAACEFUL KITTEN for three furlongs, kicked clear leaving the furlong grounds and widened under a vigorous hand
drive. GRACEFUL KITTEN dueled inside FOREST SURVIVOR to the stretch, proved no match late but held for the place. UNCORK THE BOTTLE spotted
the field a couple lengths at the start, swung four wide coming off the turn and offered a mild response to pick up a share. LEGAL DEAL raced three wide off
the dueling leaders, and came up empty in the stretch. CRACK SHOT raced four wide on the turn, and tired. GINS AND TINS saved ground early, had the
two-path into the lane, and faded.

Footnotes
OGLALA had early speed between foes, settled back into a stalking position early on the first turn, re-bid three wide near the three-eighths pole, drew clear
midway around the far turn, drifted out a bit near sixteenth and held firm under hand urging from there. PROLIFERATION tracked the pace two and three
wide and ran on for the place. MARIA'S REVENGE saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the quarter pole, rallied widest and just missed
second. EGYPTIAN BRIDE pressed the pace three then two wide and tired in the drive. GIRLY THE BUTCHER was crowded at the start, saved ground off
the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. USURPED broke inwardly, raced two and three wide and was outrun.
UNCAPTURED GRACE set the pace along the rail and retreated around the far turn. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ROYAL SQUEEZE saved ground to the turn, moved out to the three-path approaching the stretch, drifted out a bit further through the furlong grounds and
wore down UNPUBLISHED well out in the track. UNPUBLISHED sped clear early, settled into the stretch still well in command in the two-path, could not
hold off the winner but was clearly second best. UNCAPTURED KING was outsprinted early inside, moved out for the drive and offered a mild response to
go clear of the rest. NO COMMISSION raced three to four wide, and lacked the needed rally. BEAUTY QUEEN saved ground and failed to factor. PALADIO
chased the pace early, and was through after a half-mile. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

UNBRIDLED ENSIGN stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide to split rivals leaving the quarter pole, surged to the front in midstretch and held
clear under a drive. PERFECTIBLE LADY was pinched back at the start, saved ground well back for a half, advanced four wide around the far turn and
finished strongly down the center of the track. LET FREEDOM REIN was impeded and clipped heels early on the first turn then forced out and bumped soon
after, raced four wide in midpack around both turns, continued on the left lea din the lane and stayed on for the show. LINN PIER was bumped early on the
first turn, raced four wide around that bend, moved up outside down the backstretch, perched three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. AMAGE steadied early, was bumped hard early on the first turn, raced five wide around most of that bend, went just three wide around
the far turn and never threatened. FRENCH FRANC (FR) was bumped between foes at the start, was forced to check early on the first turn, raced four wide
around that bend, saved some ground while still well back around the far turn then had some late interest in the lane. OXOMOC set the pace along the rail
to midstretch and tired. ARTEMUS SWEETHEART broke inwardly and bumped foes at the start, stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the
eighth pole then faltered. TICKET TO HEAVEN was outrun inside. TAHAWEEL played no factor while racing two and three wide. LOMBARDI AVENUE was
bumped at the start, had some speed outside, was knocked sideways early on the first turn, raced three wide around most of that turn, saved ground around
the far turn and retreated. FRAGEELAY checked repeatedly while bearing out and bumping several foes around the first turn, stayed three to four wide and
was through early. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AROUND THE FIRST TURN AND TOOK NO ACTION AFTER
RULING THAT THE CULPRIT RAN LAST. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

RIOT HOUSE pressed DESERT RULER from outside while under a hold, took over readily after six furlongs, kicked clear into the lane and widened under
pressure. NIGHT JUMPER was held up behind the leaders on the first turn, moved out three wide approaching the top of the stretch, could not threaten the
winner but finished willingly. VLADISLAV saved ground to the far turn, swung out advancing into upper stretch, but could not gain any further late. DESERT
RULER set the pace inside, was no match for the winner turning for home, and faded through the stretch. IN THE UNION broke slowly, stayed in range
early three wide, and tired after six furlongs. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
LAVERY saved ground in striking range to the far turn, shifted out to the three-path approaching the stretch, and rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders from
outside through the final stages. GEMONTEER chased KITTEN STREET early, challenged between horses on the far turn, vied inside BORU into the
stretch, got the best of that battle but settled for second best. VETTORI KIN (BRZ) was outrun for six furlongs, moved out widest for the drive and finished
with good energy. OFFICER COUNTRY raced three to four wide throughout, and could not seriously menace through an even effort. BORU advanced to
loom a threat three wide after six furlongs, dueled outside GEMONTEER turning for home, then weakened past the furlong marker. KITTEN'S SPA was four
wide on the first turn, moved in a couple paths after that, and gained mildly late without threatening. HEZA KITTEN settled in the middle of the pack for six
furlongs, and lacked a solid bid. BATTLE OF BLENHEIM was never prominent. BENELUX was outrun inside. STAGE READY lunged at the break spotting
the field several lengths, and never recovered. ROBINTAKINCHARGE broke slowly and was always far back. KITTEN STREET set the pace to the far turn,
and gave way approaching the stretch. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

HANDSOME PRINCE tracked the pace three and four wide, swept to the front near the quarter pole, drew clear in midstretch and held firm under a drive.
FAMOUS GENT raced off the pace four wide around the turn and rallied through the lane. GRAINGER COUNTY chased the pace two and three wide,
lacked the needed rally but stayed on to gain the show. RICHY saved ground and failed to menace. HEALS THE SOUL dueled along the rail, kicked clear
near the five-sixteenths marker, was collared near the quarter pole and tired. NERVE pressed the pace two wide and retreated nearing the lane. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FOOD BANK HELPER was a step slow to begin, went four wide around the first turn, remained out in the course three wide turning for home, kicked in
through the furlong grounds and edged away late outside rivals. KEN LOVES KITTEN was never far back, lodged a bid two wide between horses midway
on the far turn, edged away leaving the eighth-pole, but could not hold the winner safe. SHIMMERING LIGHT settled in striking range for six furlongs near
the three-path, loomed a threat between horses in deep stretch but did not have quite enough. STOLEN MONEY broke in bumping MILLENNIUM CONDO,
got pulled off that foe and bumped into ASTRAL WEEKS, went along in the second flight saving ground, moved out in midstretch and was gaining belatedly
outside the top trio. MILLENNIUM CONDO got bumped by STOLEN MONEY at the break, stayed close inside to the far turn, came two wide into the lane
and lacked a solid closing bid. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE set the pace inside for six furlongs, and weakened through the stretch. ASTRAL WEEKS was
bumped by STOLEN MONEY after the start, saved ground and posed no threat. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) saved ground to the far turn, angled out four wide
bumping with PRINCIPE at the top of the stretch, and had no final rally. PRINCIPE saved ground early, got bumped by KODIAK MAMBA while outside that
rival at the top of the lane, and had no closing response. MOON AT MIDNIGHT was always outrun. DIPPY EVANS raced in striking range early, put in a
brief bid three to four wide on the far turn, but was finished into the stretch. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
