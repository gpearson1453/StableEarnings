Footnotes
TALE OF V K broke inwards bumping LEA ME ALONE, was quickly righted, then disputed the pace near the inside on a narrow advantage into the turn,
tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to maintain the advantage under pressure. LEA ME ALONE, stumbled, then was
bumped at the start, shifted off the inside tracking the leaders in second flight approaching the turn, switched out to gain three wide between rivals in upper
stretch and continued with interest to close the gap late. KENAI COOL tracked off the first flight inside a rival racing to the turn, saved ground to upper
stretch to bid inside the top pair but lacked the needed final kick. SUNDRENCHED was urged prompting the pace outside a rival through the backstretch
into the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and faded late. ROLLING MO settled off the second flight in early stages, angled five wide entering the
lane but made no impact. SENSIBLE MYTH trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CEDAR BEACH, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, took over racing into the far turn, opened a commanding
advantage into upper stretch and was kept to pressure. EL POLICIA tracked off the first flight between rivals to the backstretch, split foes leaving the far turn
to advance on the pacesetter but couldn't gain terms with that rival while proving best of the others. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL tracked off the first flight
inside rivals in the opening half, was shuffled behind a tiring rival leaving the far turn, but came through inside foes to edge rivals for a share. BROADWAY
RUCKUS settled last racing to the far turn, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch but was outkicked for a share. GOLDEN WONDER sped to the
lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into the far turn and gave way nearing upper stretch.
BENNY'S FIDDLE tracked the leaders three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn.

Footnotes
INEDATEQUILA broke readily to gain the lead between calls racing to the first turn, conceded the lead to track just off the pacesetter to the backstretch,
moved to wrest the advantage from that foe midway through the far turn, then held sway through the lane under steady pressure. MELANCHOLY BLUES
tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn, then continued with
interest nearest the rail to edge a rival for the place honors late. DR. ANN, urged to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage to
the far turn, but proved no match when confronted by the winner. MAGICGIRL settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, switched out
four wide racing through the stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. MIZZEN AIR angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter in the
opening half, continued in pursuit of the leaders into the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. D FLAT WHITE settled inside foes racing to the
backstretch and failed to menace. HUSH Y'ALL was settled outside foes in the last flight and faded after a half.

Footnotes
SCHOCHOH, prominent inside rivals from the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, tipped off the inside nearing the lane,
forged clear in upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement while widening. EXPENSIVE STYLE was rated while angling to the inside early, gained
position inside foes entering the turn and edged foes for the place honors through the lane. BABY BOOMER tracked just off the leaders four wide on the
backstretch, gained ground on the pacesetter three wide racing through the turn but lacked the needed final bid. NEWYEARSBLOCKPARTY tracked the
pacesetter between foes in the opening stages and steadily faded into the turn. FIG JELLY was urged prompting the pacesetter between foes racing to the
turn and gave way into upper stretch. UNRIDEABULL settled outside foes in the opening stages and never menaced thereafter.

Footnotes
MACHINEGUNPREACHER, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, tipped off the rail after a half gaining some position, swung out five wide nearing
upper stretch and produced a sustained response to wrest the advantage from LAGERFELDT in time under firm handling. The latter angled to the inside in
early stages, steadily advanced along the rail nearing the far turn to bid for command nearing upper stretch, moved away to a clear advantage midstretch
but couldn't fend off the winner's bid. HE'SSOSUBTLE, carried wide racing into the first turn tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance, steadily
advanced on the leaders four wide through the far turn but was outkicked by the top pair while prevailing for a share. JUPITER RAIN settled between foes
racing to the backstretch, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. PROCURADOR tracked off the second
flight between foes racing to the backstretch but had no closing response when called upon on the far turn. SUMMER BOSS, urged to a forward placing
tracking the leader, tipped to the three path racing into the far turn while moving to challenge leaving the midway point of that bend to gain a brief advantage
but came up empty in the drive. ECCENTRICO settled while angling inside racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. QUICK HIT, urged clear along the
inside racing to the first turn, set the pace a bit off the rail racing to the second bend and gave out between foes on the far turn. TONY'S GOLD settled last
to the backstretch and offered no rally. JAQUE MATE COCO drifted out racing through the first turn impeding HE'SSOSUBTLE and soon gave way.

Footnotes
BOLD PAYNTER was settled outside a rival dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, was prompted to commence a steady advance nearing
the far turn, gained on the leaders four wide nearing upper stretch and responded to firm left handed pressure to edge TENEBRIS narrowly in time. The
latter racing in touch with a rival prompting the pace while striking the front between calls racing to the backstretch, moved to challenge in tandem with
TAPSASIONAL three deep leaving the far turn, took over entering the lane, then resisted the winner's bid to late stages while proving only second best.
HARD LIGHTING was settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and displayed some belated interest to close the gap
while prevailing for a share. SHALDAG, urged along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the second bend, contested the lead inside foes
into upper stretch and gave way late. TAPSASIONAL was rated stalking just off the first flight in the opening half, angled to the inside to bid inside rivals on
the far turn but soon flattened out. BRIDGEKEEPER settled out of striking distance along the inside and faded early.

Footnotes
MARQUET MALICE, carried in at the start, was settled into stride near the inside, steadily advanced on the leaders after a half, switched out four wide
nearing upper stretch, then continued with a sustained rally angling inside the leader in late stages to just edge that foe in time under firm handling. HAD
RIGHT, forwardly placed while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, tipped out nearing the far turn to wrest the advantage from a tiring pacesetter on
the second bend, went well clear racing into the stretch while drifting out in the closing stages and just failed to contain the winner. DIAL HIM UP, off slowly,
was settled last to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to earn a share. BENCH WALK, cut off at the
start, was righted quickly to track off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, made a brief advance three wide nearing the far turn but quickly
came up empty nearing the lane. CONSIDER ME angled to the inside tracking just off the leaders racing to the backstretch, shifted off the inside to bid
between foes racing into the far turn but came up empty in the drive. RUM NOT BOURBON, fractious in the gate prior to the start, veered in at the break
crossing over the path of BENCH WALK while bumping CONSIDER ME forcing that foe into ESCAPED REALITY and the eventual winner, proved no
threat. ESCAPED REALITY, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, proved no threat. SPEEDY DAREDEVIL broke slowly, raced a bit rank
under restraint, pulled his way to the lead three deep racing to the first turn, angled inside once gaining a clear advantage, set the pace to the second bend
and was spent entering the far turn. GREAT JUNIOR, forwardly placed between foes racing to the first turn, was steadied out of tight quarters nearing the
second bend and soon gave way. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND DISQUALIFIED RUM
NOT BOURBON FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM SEVENTH.

EXXEL broke readily, prompted the pace between foes just off the inside racing into the turn, dueled inside rivals on a narrow advantage a bit off the rail into
upper stretch, then shook clear late under firm right handed encouragement. INCREDIBLE BILL was urged forcing the pace three wide from the outset into
the turn, dueled for command in that path between foes into upper stretch but proved only second best. KENRIC was rated tracking off the first flight from
just out of striking distance racing to the turn, then continued with an effort to gain some position inside rivals in the closing stages. DOUBLE WARRIOR
stalked just off the first flight while shifting out four wide nearing the turn, advanced in that path to challenge for command nearing upper stretch but flattened
out in the drive. EMPIRE BUILDER broke slowly and never gained contention. MARK OF VALOR was urged inside foes pressing the pace from the outset
to the turn and gave way midway through the bend. FINALIZE, carried out at the start, never gained contention. HE IS READY ducked out at the start
impeding FINALIZE and soon gave way.

TWISTED TREASURE, in touch with the leaders three deep leaving the chute, was eased off those rivals to stalk just off the first flight near the inside to the
backstretch, tipped out nearing the far turn to bid between rivals approaching upper stretch, was carried out to the four path entering the lane by MISS
GHISLAINE but edged that rival in time under firm encouragement. The latter was urged between foes, then outside a rival prompting the pace to the
backstretch, took over after a half to set the pace along the inside to the far turn, was roused to resist the winner while drifting well outside racing into upper
stretch but couldn't contain that foe. MAJESTIC QUEEN angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the far turn, altered course avoiding tiring
foes racing into upper stretch but split foes in the closing stages to prevail for a share. FARCICAL, off slowly, was settled outside a rival racing to the
backstretch, angled five wide racing through the stretch and displayed some late interest to gain some position. V K STAR was urged along the inside
disputing the pace from the outset, lost ground to the pacesetter after a half and gave way inside foes nearing the lane. BIONDA SUPRISE switched off the
inside early tracking off the first flight, advanced nearing the second bend to lodge a brief, three wide bid on the far turn but quickly flattened out. TAMI'S
ORCHID, reserved near the inside in the opening half, tipped out on the far turn to gain position between foes nearing upper stretch, drifted out under
pressure and came up empty late. MAY BEAU proved no factor.
