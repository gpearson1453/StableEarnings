INDELIBLE IMAGE never far back, closed willingly four wide into the stretch, battled through the final furlong and proved best under a strong hand ride.
BUSYBEING FABULOUS broke in front, drifted out leaving the chute, was gradually righted, prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, made the lead
before the furlong marker, set the balance of the pace but couldn't handle the winner. CAN I GO TOO slow early, found her best stride late.
PERFECTINGTHEVIEW sped up the inside to gain a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch then weakened late. HIGH
CUPPER was no threat. BAY MAGIC had speed into the turn then faded. MINE ALONE inside, lacked the needed response.
