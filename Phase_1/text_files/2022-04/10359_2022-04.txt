STARINTHEMAKING raced in closest pursuit of the loose pacesetter, took over on the final turn, drew clear and remained safe to the finish OFF THE
MEDS settled close up inside, angled out at the quarter pole and rallied. BIG CITY RALPH trailed before half a mile, advanced very wide, loomed a threat
but flattened out. KINGS HIGHWAY lacked speed, angled inside down the backstretch and was no factor. TY RAN A HOMER quickly opened long lead,
was collared on the final turn and gave way. YONDERING was urged close up for half a mile and faded on the final turn.

WHATRUWAITINGFOR tracked the pace in the early stages, moved up two wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled, gained a short lead, then dug in
gamely inside of DON'T TELL FRANKIE and turned away that rival to prevail. DON'T TELL FRANKIE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace, off the
rail, advanced on the turn, rallied outside into the stretch, dueled with the winner past midstretch and was outfinished late. WITHOUT A VIEW raced off the
pace inside, advanced on the turn, bid between rivals on the turn, dueled into the lane and weakened. RUBY DOOBY DOO raced off the pace inside,
moved up on the turn and failed to threaten. GUNS UP stalked outside a rival, then chased and gave way. SCARF stumbled at the start and bumped a rival,
raced off the pace and did not factor. ET'S PREMONITION showed good early speed to set the pace, opened up a clear lead and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
DIESEL hustled to the front inside, widened on the turn, was kept to a steady drive and lasted while tiring late. DEFIBRILLATOR saved ground off the pace,
angled out in the stretch and closed well. OTIS OTIS OTIS took a bad step and bobbled in the opening quarter then willingly inside. PENNSYLVANIA
STEEL broke a bit awkwardly, raced close up outside and flattened late. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR stumbled badly at the start losing any chance. THE
WANT OF A NAIL dwelt at the start breaking far behind his field and was no factor. MOON PISTOL dropped back inside and was always outrun.
GRANDFIRE raced in the two path and weakened steadily. The trainer of the third finisher claimed foul against the winner for interference on the
backstretch but the result was allowed to stand.

SMILE raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a rally. AMERICAN ROMA raced three wide early, stalked the pace, went three
wide on the far turn and failed to respond. CHARLIE THE GREEK raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. CANTSTOPRUNNING raced four wide

Footnotes
CONQUISTADOR dueled outside, took over on the turn and remained safe driving. TOMATER GATOR settled outside, advanced three wide, loomed a
threat and continued willingly. NO FOOLING DUDE dueled inside the winner then faded but held on for the show. LOVERBOY LOU lacked speed then
closed well wide through the stretch. CATCH FIRE raced wide throughout and was never a factor. STRAWBERRY RED was urged close up inside down the
backstretch and gave way. TOOK A CAB raced outside off the leaders and proved empty in the stretch. BIG BAD BUD trailed early and passed a fading
rival. JERSEY JOE B broke sluggishly, moved up inside and stopped abruptly.
