BOLD'N NAUGHTY raced wide throughout, advanced in the final furlong and was up in the final yards in a tight finish. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE saved ground,
rallied to the front a sixteenth away but was nailed at the wire. WHATRUWAITINGFOR pursued the loose pacesetter, took over into the stretch but was
caught late. MISQUILLO lagged far behind, advanced inside then flattened out late. SHARON'S LAW moved close up early inside then gave way readily.
STARSHIP ROGUE hustled to the front, widened before half a mile then stopped in the stretch.

Footnotes
DECKOLOGY controlled the fractions, widened on the final turn and maintained a big advantage under mild coaxing. MISSION OBERON lagged far behind
for half a mile, split rivals rallying for the place. PIGGYBANK raced in midpack, faded on the final turn then came again for show. WE BE THERE settled
inside, brief bid on the final turn then flattened out. GREEN GROWTH was urged just off the winner for three quarters and faded. CAPE MAY STYLE moved
closer up wide for five furlongs and gave way. SAMARONTI raced wide throughout and weakened after five furlongs. POLITICAL trailed throughout racing
wide.

BEACH DAZE reserved inside, repelled a rival into the stretch and pulled away through the final furlong. CHELSEA WALL saved ground throughout,
awaited room on the final turn, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. POSITIVE POWER raced very rank in the early stages, moved between
rivals and lacked a further response. SWEET SAMURAI prompted the pace three wide and was finished after three quarters. NURTURING set a clear pace,
was collared near the quarter pole and faded. OUI MADAME raced very wide and gave way readily.

WRITE THE CHECK prompted the pace outside, bid to front midway on the turn and stayed safe under moderate urging. MISS ALEX forced the pace in the
two path then inside and proved no match for the winner. BROAD JUMPER saved ground, angled out on the turn and continued well. BEAUTIFUL STAR
chased wide down the backstretch and was never a factor. WEDDINIGHTJITTERS raced just off the pace in the two path and gave way. SWEET
BALLERINA lagged far behind then passed a fading rival. BOHEMIA BABE led briefly inside then was finished after half a mile.

the pace, angled three wide on the turn then gradually faded. ALEJANDRO'S TEAM dropped well behind, moved inside in the stretch and flattened out. MY
