Footnotes
INTERNET OF THINGS broke readily, moved away to a clear advantage setting the pace in hand racing off the inside to the backstretch, came under some
prompting to maintain a safe margin nearing upper stretch, then held sway through the lane on a widening advantage on his own courage in a ridden out
effort. MIGHTY GHOST settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shifted three wide after a half advancing on the leader, moved
to prompt that foe racing through the far turn but was no match in the drive while clearly best of the others. PICCADILLY BEAU tracked the pacesetter
outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, then continued evenly between foes in the closing stages to prevail for a share. COUNTY COURT was
rated off the second flight along the inside for the opening five furlongs, switched outside foes nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. FADE AWAY
tracked the pacesetter along the inside as part of the second flight racing to the far turn and faded in late stages.

Footnotes
RATTLESNAKE RIDGE was urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin through the
backstretch, widened the advantage racing into upper stretch and continued under firm pressure to maintain a safe margin to the end. HARD TEN tracked
the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, then continued with a steady effort through the stretch to close the gap on the winner late.
AYCAPOTE broke readily, tipped a bit off the inside tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight to the far turn, then continued evenly in late
stages while gaining a share. PHARAOH FANCY PANT tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside in the opening half, shifted out three wide racing into
the far turn while being urged to make some brief progress outside foes but lacked the needed closing bid. MACHO REAL settled last while angling to the
inside racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. TAPSOLUTE settled well off the leaders racing off the rail to the backstretch and proved no factor.

Footnotes
SUPER SHOES was urged outside rivals tracking the pacesetter in second flight to the backstretch, steadily advanced three deep in tandem with RACHEL
DREAM to challenge for command racing into the far turn, continued in a prolonged drive contesting the issue outside that foe to late stages but edged
forward to prevail in time under right handed pressure. BLACK LIMO, pulled a bit against rating racing inside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter to the
backstretch, came through along the rail to challenge for command entering the far turn, gained the advantage approaching upper stretch, then continued
with a grudging effort to the end while just failing to contain the winner. PRAKRITI, reserved outside a rival racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance in the three path racing into the far turn, but lacked the needed closing bid while continuing well enough to earn a share. GRUNDER, urged clear
racing a bit off the rail to the backstretch, set the pace for a half, dueled for command between foes racing through the far turn and gave way into upper
stretch. AND THE OSCAR GOES tracked off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the far turn.
BYRON'S GOLD settled last racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. RACHEL DREAM settled into stride along the inside in the opening stages and
faded early.

Footnotes
CANDY COVE broke sharply, was taken under rating to stalk just off the leaders while angling inside nearing the turn, advanced on the pacesetter inside
foes nearing upper stretch, tipped out while readily advancing to challenge for command midstretch and went well clear under firm handling, then was taken
in hand approaching the wire. VALIANT VIRTUE was urged along the rail disputing the pace inside rivals through the backstretch into the turn, edged clear
nearing upper stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. EXAMINER vied for command three wide between foes through the backstretch,
dropped back entering the turn, then continued with a steady effort between foes to regain position in the closing stages while prevailing for a share.
PREPARE FOR GLORY settled well off the leaders racing through the backstretch, swung out four wide entering the stretch and displayed some belated
interest. BLAME BISHOP angled inwards to prompt the pace four wide through the backstretch to the turn and gave way in the drive. SLIPPY, urged
between foes pressing the pace from the outset to the turn, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
SNEAKY CHEEKY tipped outside a rival racing to the first turn while being urged to prompt that rival into the backstretch, pressed the issue racing into the
far turn to strike the front nearing upper stretch, edged clear between calls and maintained the advantage to the end under firm right handed pressure.
MAARTY'S DILEMMA, caught wide racing as part of the last flight to the backstretch, settled outside foes to the second bend, was prompted to advance
while caught five wide nearing upper stretch, but rallied in that path in the closing stages to close the gap on the winner. STARSHIP PRECIOUS, urged to
the lead while angling to the inside racing into the first turn, dueled for command through the far turn into upper stretch and weakened late while prevailing
for a share. LAP OF LUXURY angled inwards to track off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out to gain some position four wide between
foes nearing the lane but lacked the needed final bid. MURUMBI broke readily, was urged to a forward placing pursuing the leaders four wide into the
backstretch, continued in that path through the far turn and came up empty late. JEFF'S ANGEL settled along the inside early, angled out six wide in the
stretch and gained some position while making no impact. BRASS BAND broke readily, then was rated between foes tracking just off the leaders to the
backstretch, came under pressure to advance between foes on the far turn but lacked the needed late response. SCOOP THERE IT IS, forwardly placed
three wide between foes tracking just off the leaders to the far turn, gave way into the lane. XCARET angled to the inside racing into the first turn gaining a
position tracking just off the first flight through the backstretch but steadily faded racing into the far turn. PERGOLA proved no factor.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI was urged to gain the lead while shifting inwards just after the start, dictated the pace a bit off the rail racing into the turn, widened the
advantage racing into upper stretch and was kept to the task while drawing well clear. CONFESSOR, reserved between foes in the opening stages, shifted
out four wide racing into the turn while being prompted to advance, then continued with a steady effort in that path to prevail for the place honors. R
MERCEDES BOY, urged along the rail prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, couldn't maintain striking distance after a half and
weakened between foes in late stages while edging rivals for a share. DOUGIE D ORO, off a bit slowly, saved ground on the turn gaining position, briefly
awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, then continued evenly inside foes in the last furlong. HE'S SMOKIN NOW was settled outside foes in the last
flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance while being fanned five wide nearing upper stretch and made no real impression. ASTRONAUT
OSCAR was rated between foes tracking the pacesetter through the backstretch, was urged to make some brief progress three wide between foes nearing
upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. HIDE THE DEMON, urged along the three wide pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch, shifted
inwards to race between foes on the turn but soon gave way.

Footnotes
SUNNY SAINT was hustled clear of the field racing well off the rail to the backstretch, held sway on a commanding margin through the far turn into upper
stretch and was kept to brisk handling. NIP OF BOURBON tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch, then continued four wide
through the far turn, then five wide into the stretch to prevail for the place honors. HOLIDAY DANCER settled outside foes in the last flight to the
backstretch, angled out five wide entering the stretch and found his best stride in the closing stages to improve position while missing for second.
STARSHIP OREO settled outside foes off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted inwards nearing the far turn while being prompted to advance
between rivals but had no closing bid. GIVE ME TWO STEPS tracked off the second flight between rivals in the opening half, angled inside racing into the
far turn and faded in the drive. ICY STORM, off slowly, then shuffled back at the start, angled to the rail racing to the backstretch, lost some momentum
avoiding tight quarters nearing the far turn but continued to save ground to late stages. HERECOMESTHEHAMMER, urged to a forward placing pursuing
the pacesetter a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, gave way between foes nearing upper stretch. STAYIN OR STRAYIN tracked the leaders near the
inside as part of the second flight but steadily faded racing into the far turn. COMMANDER KEITH dropped out early.

Footnotes
MR. MAZZA was urged prompting the pace between foes racing to the backstretch, conceded some ground to the pacesetter between calls nearing the far
turn, was urged to press the issue nearing upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and edged clear under firm handling. GUNMAN, urged along the
inside dictating the pace, edged clear between calls racing into the far turn, dueled into upper stretch and proved only second best. MAKOTO settled outside
a rival dropping off the first flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn and made the most of an inside trip to improve
position. TEDDY'S HONOR, caught four wide racing into the first turn while prompted to a forward placing, tracked off the first flight to the far turn but lacked
a rally. TOUR THE WORLD was settled into stride a bit off the inside racing off the first flight to the backstretch and steadily faded entering the far turn.
POLITO, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace to the backstretch, continued in that path to challenge on the far turn, then gave way into the
lane.
