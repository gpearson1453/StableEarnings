CARMON'S DANCE set a pressured pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, shied from the whip late and held safely. PRINCESS JADA raced close to
the pace, challenged three across into the turn, fell back and finished second best. SUMMER LOVE pressed the pace, challenged between horses into the
turn, fell back, went evenly late and held for show. TOP LADY MARGIE was never far back, lacked the needed late response and failed to menace.
TWILIGHT GALAXY was void of early speed, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a bid. WOMAN TO BLAME pressed the pace while racing inside,
stopped entering the turn and was not urged through the stretch.

Footnotes
UPPER ROOM dueled two across to deep stretch and inched away to prove best in a long drive. JOHNNY dueled inside, couldn't match strides and was
outfinished in a game effort. DON'TTEASETHETIGER raced close to the pace towards the outside, went six wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and
earned show in a good effort. COASTLINE SERMON was unhurried early, offered a mild bid under left handed urging and failed to menace. TAPIT AT
MIDNIGHT was slow early, raced inside, lacked a rally and was not a threat. LOVER BOY BOB stalked the pace to the second turn, tired and dropped back.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

BLUE BOY WHO pressed the pace four across, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, was under pressure late and held well under steady left handed urging.
GATO DE RAYO was never far back, rallied around the turn, bid seven wide, closed steadily and gained late. CRACK A COLD ONE broke slowly, was
unhurried early and raced in the back, closed willingly and was gaining late. FLOWER BEACH was slow early, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and
finished well. FORTY FATHOMS vied between horses to the turn, fell back and went evenly late. JACK COOL pressed the pace while racing along the rail,
was taken back entering the turn, angled out, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and lacked a rally. DEMERARA raced inside, showed speed to the
turn and stopped.

DANCE SHOES pressed the pace, bid three wide between horses on the turn, drew off for a clear lead and held safely while kept to task. CHEWY CHEWY
GOOD dueled to the turn, fell back and was all out for place. MISS IMPORTANT was void of early speed, went widest in the drive, found her best stride late
and was gaining fast. KELANI KIM stalked the pace while racing outside, rallied four wide on the turn to loom a threat, fell back and finished evenly.
SARJENALLI was never far back, went seven wide entering the stretch and lacked the needed rally. RED NOON RISING was outrun in an even effort. SO
ELUSIVE broke slowly, was rushed to contention to vie inside to the turn, fell back and faded. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
CALIBOGEE assumed command along the backstretch, drew clear on the turn and held safely while kept to task. AUTISM SAVANT pressed the pace, bid,
hung late and finished second best. BLUES RAPPER was void of early speed, offered a mild bid mid track and earned show while no threat to the top two.
HAMMERING LEMON stumbled at the start, pressed the pace four wide to the turn and flattened out. THE THIRD RING led around the first turn, vied to the
second turn, tired and stopped.
