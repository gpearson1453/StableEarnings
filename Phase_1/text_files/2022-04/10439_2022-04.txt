four wide rally and missed the place. LUCKILY stalked the pace while racing three wide made a bid in the stretch but faltered. HEY ROXY tracked the
leaders from the inside and steadily faded. ANGEL'S CUT set the early pace and gave way late.

Footnotes
DICEY raced near the back then moved to go between horses at the top of the stretch to be up in final strides. RAGAN'S JET stalked the pace from the
three path made her move on the turn to draw clear but was caught near the wire. DIPPING IN was unhurried early then advanced on the turn and had to
angle out to make a four wide rally for the show. SHE'S SHINEY vied for the lead from the two path but weakened in the drive. SWEET MARY M was
forwardly placed on the inside and came up empty in the drive. COUNTRY DAISY failed to menace. GREEN EYED BELLE was never a threat. CASINO
QUEEN set the early pace from the inside and gave way late.
