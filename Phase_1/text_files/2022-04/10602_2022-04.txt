BATTLESHIP BEVO was bumped at the start by MONSTER RIVER, saved ground around both turns just off the pace slipped up the rail then angled out at
the top of the stretch and drew off. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE set a clear pace through both turns but lacked a late response in the stretch drive. VALENTINE
GUY prompted the pace from the three path through both turns and finished well. MONSTER RIVER broke to the inside and bumped BATTLESHIP BEVO
at the start, then pressed the pace from the two path through the second turn and fought gamely in the drive. SMART CALL hopped at the start to spot the
field a couple of lengths, was then rushed to contention while being four wide and gave way at the five sixteenths pole.

stretch and held well. HIT ONE OUT was three wide in the first turn and set a pressured pace from just off the rail through the second turn and fought with
rival down the stretch and gave way late. COMMANDING OFFICER was off a step slow and was allowed to settle through the backstretch made his bid
from four wide on the turn to improve position late. TAG ME went two wide in to the first turn and saved ground just off the rail while being close up but gave
an even effort. PRINCE OF EARL was four wide going in to the first turn and was placed just off the pace in the two path on the backstretch, made a bid on
the second turn but faltered. I CAN'T TELL YA went five wide in the first turn then tracked the leaders from the three path on the backstretch but was one

Footnotes
ROSIE OKIE prompted the pace from four wide then settled mid pack on the turn move at head of stretch and split foes mid stretch to be up final jump.
CANDY'S A DANDY had a pressured lead to late in the stretch and was caught late. SWEET TEA RED pressed the pace from the two path to be best of the
rest. WOW WOW ITS MAGIC was placed just off the pace in the two path then made a rail bid on the turn moved three wide in the stretch to improve
position. HEELS TO THE FIELD dueled for the lead from the inside and weakened. MRSG'S LIL DREAMER was rushed to contention from four wide made
a mild bid on the turn but lacked a late response. BRAVE COOL KITTY failed to menace. DIAMOND GAL was never a factor. SWEET ISABELLE was never
a threat.
