Footnotes
LOVE TO RUN set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, remained clear to deep stretch and held safe under a drive. SCHOOL DANCE
lacked early speed inside, edged closer two wide around the far turn, swung five wide near the quarter pole, closed down the center of the track and ran out
of ground. TEQUILERA tracked the pace from the rail, moved into second inside of the winner in midstretch but was one-paced through the final furlong.
IKO IKO settled off the early pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and flattened out in the final furlong. BITTY BOSS went evenly while
racing two wide. DOWNBURST prompted the winner two wide and tired in the drive. GINGER SPARKLE stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in
the lane. PLATINUM MOON was very reluctant to load and was always outrun outside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
RESTLESS EYES was never too far back and tipped out to race four wide in early stages, prompted leaving the backstretch, responded willingly and took
over the lead mid-way around the turn, came three wide into the lane, widened to commanding lead while ridden out in the upper stretch then wrapped up in
the final furlong and continued to pull away. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN raced two wide not far back in early stages then weakened leaving the backstretch,
launched a five wide rebid at the head of the lane, responded under steady urging and gained second best. DATTTSAFANCYFOX chased the top pair in
early stages, sustained a three wide bid around the turn, churned on through the lane and prevailed for a share. ADIOS DIXIE chased inside in early stages,
tipped out around the turn, came four wide into the upper stretch, drifted out wider under left handed pressure and needed more for impact. AKEMI vied for
the early lead, shook free and briefly led the way leaving the backstretch, got collared by the winner mid-way around the turn, continued to chase after the
lead to the furlong marker then came up empty. K COTTEE vied inside of AKEMI for the early lead, could not match strides entering the turn, chased inside
into the lane and had nothing left in late reserve. MISS BETH'EL got bumped after the start, dropped to last and had no response.

Footnotes
KHAFRE settled in midpack early, advanced approaching the stretch going comfortably, tipped out to take a run at LIAM'S BOY from outside turning for
home, ran past that rival in short order and drew away hand urged. UNION BUSTER chased the pacesetter early, came under a ride on the far turn but
could not gain, straightened away for the drive and finished with good energy to go clear of the rest. POLINESIA broke a step slow and steadied back,
lagged well back early inside, went three then four wide around the far turn, and was along for the show. LIAM'S BOY sped away early, saw most of the
lead whittled away with a quarter-mile remaining, was unable to withstand the winner into upper stretch and gave way. DEEP STATE was outrun inside.
CANYOUHEARMENOW was no factor three wide. MOTAWAAFEQ stayed in range two wide for a half-mile, and tired. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AMAZIN QUEEN settled off the pace along the inside, edged closer three wide around most of the far turn, angled five wide near the quarter pole, kicked in
outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. VANDALIA raced off the early pace four wide, advanced four wide around the far turn,
bid between foes in midstretch and was clearly second best. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT prompted the pace two wide around the first turn, dueled two wide
down the backstretch and around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner late but stayed on to save the show. HIGH VIBES set a pressured
pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened. SANDPIPER MEMORIES bobbled at the break, stalked the pace three wide and faded in the lane.
CALIFORNIA GIGI was in range inside and came up empty in the lane. FLECHE D'AMOUR chased the pace two wide and retreated through the lane.
MOUNT SINAI raced very wide, faltered around the far turn and was easing through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BOB MARCO raced up close along the rail in the first turn then settled nicely and tracked inside up the backstretch, continued in close range along the rail
late on the far turn, tipped a path wider and given cue at the head of the lane, raced in tight quarters then split foes gamely and edged away. BORN A
GAMBLER raced in striking distance around the first turn and stalked the leader two wide up the backstretch, launched a bid for command late on the far
turn, dug in three wide a furlong out, could not kick on with the winner but sustained solid response and cleared second best. TETRAGRAMMATON held a
slim lead around the first turn and set a comfortable pace while saving ground up the backstretch, roused for more leaving the final turn, fought back under
threat from outside duo at the furlong marker then got collared by the winner and weakened to show. DANIEL SUN was never too far back while settled two
wide through early stages, was ridden along two wide through the far turn then tipped four wide for the drive and lacked the needed response for serious
impact. MALIBU TIME settled two paths off the inside in early stages, waited patiently around the far turn, got clear two wide at the head of the lane and ran
on evenly under steady urging. CADET CORPS stalked in striking range up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide in contention around the final turn
then flattened out in the lane. SUN VIKING was taken in hand in opening stages to settle in the rear, was unhurried three wide up the backstretch, hustled
up five wide into the upper stretch and failed to rally.

Footnotes
METEORITO bumped with FISHING FOR FUN at the start, then took control early, rated along inside extending the advantage after six furlongs, and
continued to widen through the stretch under pressure. GONNA BE EPIC lagged far back to the stretch near the two-path, moved out for the drive and
rallied between rivals to get up for the place. BACH went along in midpack early, raced three to four wide on the far turn, drifted inward leaving the furlong
grounds and was up for third on the rail. JOE PHILLIPS was reserved early in range, advanced with aim at METEORITO on the far turn, then drifted out
weakening into the final furlong. DOUBLE BLESSING broke open the gate and dislodged the rider prior to the start, raced sluggishly for six furlongs,
improved position five wide into upper stretch, then flattened out. SUPERPOSITION was three wide to the far turn, and never factored. G FRIDAY chased
the leaders early, came under a ride on the far turn, and tired after six furlongs. WILD TEXAS TOM was always outrun. NO DRAMA saved ground to no
avail. WILLIAM BOY raced three to four wide, and made no impact. FISHING FOR FUN broke out bumping METEORITO and took the worst of that
exchange, saved ground and tired after six furlongs. SOUPER FORTUNE prompted the pace for six furlongs, and stopped.

Footnotes
MENDENHALL set the pace in the two path, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. LOGICO was bumped at the start, raced well back
three and four wide for five furlongs then finished strongly outside. BREAKWATER was bumped at the start, tracked the pace four wide, bid outside of the
winner in upper stretch, could not keep pace with that foe leaving the eighth pole but stayed on to hold third. LAW OF THE JUNGLE broke a bit awkwardly,
raced in range inside, angled out in upper stretch, lugged in in midstretch and lacked the needed rally. DAYS OF YORE broke inwardly and bumped
BREAKWATER into LOGICO, pressed the winner in the three path and tired after a half. AGARRAMESIPUEDES chased the pace two wide and steadily
faded. GATE RUNNER hit the starting gate to get away last, raced well back three wide and never threatened. BROKEN SPUR was outrun outside.

Footnotes
CONUNDRUM QUEEN stalked the leader up the backstretch, vied two wide around the far turn, held a slim lead into the upper stretch, responded gamely
under pressure in the upper stretch, turned back the bid from ATOMIC ROSE and kicked clear. KENTUCKY PRIDE brushed with rival at the start then
steadied slightly heading into the first turn, remained unhurried outside up the backstretch, picked up the pace late on the far turn, swung five wide into the
upper stretch, finished strongly and captured place. ADELE KAT rated near midpack through early stages, was ridden along three wide with a quarter-mile
remaining, ran on four wide into the upper stretch, raced in tandem with KENTUCKY PRIDE in the final sixteenth and got up for a share. ATOMIC ROSE
tracked in range up the backstretch, loomed three wide late on the far turn, sustained bid for the winner into the final furlong then yielded late and lost runner
up spots. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG set the pace up the backstretch, vied with the winner around the far turn, could not match strides for the lead turning for
home but sustained bid into the final furlong then gave way. HARDLY SOCIAL steadied on the first turn, settled through early stages, picked up the pace
entering the final turn, angled to the rail and cut the corner entering the lane, tipped a path wider in the upper stretch and ran on evenly. ELUSIVE
UNCAPTURED was a bit keen and tugged while being rated in close contention, chased two wide around the far turn then gave way in the lane. SPLICER
steadied on the first turn, settled four paths wide in the early going, was ridden along three wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on.
BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY settled off the early pace, saved ground through the final turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive and had no response. BLUES
SONGS raced midpack in the opening quarter then dropped to last and offered no late rally.

Footnotes
MR MAC QUHAE settled in the second flight early, swung four wide approaching the stretch, kicked in through the last sixteenth of a mile and was up in
time outside rivals. GREAT UNCLE set the pace inside, repelled a bid from QUANTUM THEORY around the far turn and into upper stretch, held on
stubbornly but was edged out late. BOGGIEMIESTER raced in range two to three wide to the stretch, moved inside with a rail bid and narrowly missed.
SPACE RUNNER was bumped between horses just after the start, raced well back to the stretch, and rallied mildly outside. STREAMING TAP raced close
up inside, and lacked the needed closing bid. BLUTO'S CANDY was bumped between horses after the start, raced well back early, and improved position
without threatening. QUANTUM THEORY pressed the early pace, challenged outside GREAT UNCLE through the far turn and into the stretch, and
weakened. FIERY HEART was no menace three wide. MY BROTHER MIKE bumped with SPACE RUNNER after the start, raced four wide early, and had
no rally. GLOBES pressed the early pace two wide, and tired after a half-mile. PIPER AT WAR was never prominent. JEST ABOVE came in bumping
BLUTO'S CANDY after the break, raced five to four wide early, and tired. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTE GRIT broke a bit awkwardly, advanced inside down the backstretch, stalked the pace inside, muscled his way out five wide leaving the quarter
pole, responded outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. DOO WOP DON settled off the pace while racing two
wide, rallied through the lane and gained the place late. OLD TIME REVIVAL set the pace in the two path, led to the sixteenth pole and kept trying to just
miss second. GANGLY saved ground off the pace, stayed on the rail through the stretch and improved position. TWICE TOO MANY pressed the pace in the
three path and weakened through the lane. THE DISTRACTOR stalked the pace four wide and faded in the lane. BAILEY was off a bit slow and outrun
while racing four and five wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
KNOWWHENTOFOLDEM saved ground and settled off the early pace, began to edge a bit closer but lacked a clear path late on the far turn, shifted out
approaching the upper stretch, got clear through traffic, finished willingly and surged clear. SWEET ACTRESS stalked up the backstretch, loomed three
wide at the quarter pole then roused to the lead in the head of the lane, widened advantage and stayed on with good response but could not hold off the
winner nearing the wire. WHAT KNOT rated near midpack through early stages, hustled along two wide around the far turn, dug in three deep a furlong out
and fought gamely to captured show. HURRY UP DEAR raced off the early pace, made a move four deep mid-way around the far turn, advanced into
contention then was forced to steady when the winner came out a path in the upper stretch, kept on with response and got edged late for show. ALWAYS
EDEN settled off the pace, raced wide into the upper stretch, showed interest in late stages and improved position. TOUCH OF LOVE was fractious in the
gate then came away in good order, settled near the inside through the early going, swung wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. TOURASTAR raced
four wide into the first turn then quickly angled in and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, fought back to hold a slim lead around the far turn then got
collared for the lead turning for home and gave way. CREME CARAMEL was off slow at the start and continued well reserved five wide up the backstretch,
swung wide into the lane and passed some faders. BITTY BABY was hustled up out of the gate then settled in range saving ground, remained in contention
along the rail on the far turn then tired in the drive. BRAIN TRUST was keen and tugged racing under restraint and forced to go out wider moving through
the first turn, prompted the pace up the backstretch, continued a bid in aim late on the far turn, ran on into the upper stretch then faded. JUANITA R raced
four wide into the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, remained in close contention three furlongs from home then came up empty late on the
far turn. MORENA DANCER was off slow at the start and trailed throughout. RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE
