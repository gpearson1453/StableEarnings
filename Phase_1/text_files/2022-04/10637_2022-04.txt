DREWSCOURT (IRE) bided his time for the first mile or so, at times fifteen lengths behind the early leader CHETZERON and GAY BREEZE. With
approximately six furlongs remaining his move was made ranging up closer and closer where he and his foes were marginally separated at the head of the
straight. Less than a hundred yards to the finish the winner lunged forward to narrowly best. GAYE BREEZE (IRE) who worked hard throughout, settling as
leader of the second flight as CHETZERON had his way for over 12 furlongs. Met with a challenge from ultimate winner halfway through the event where the
traded second and third placement. When the field turned for home the remaining four were heads apart with a length and a half separating them. GAY
BREEZE surged to make a game, final bid but was just short. HIGH MOUNTE (IRE) sat well behind the leaders throughout most of the going until he made
his run at the leaders with a quarter to go. Showed strong footing at the top of the stretch to put its head in front briefly until the first two finishers out gamed
the gelding. CHETZERON (FR) went straight to the front, leading at one point beyond 15 lengths. The attempt to steal the race got thwarted when he lost
steam coming down the hill the final time, before the last fence when the rider pulled him up. BOSS MAN although he was last throughout the going when
they were approaching the eighth fence the gained momentum and was less than three parts of a length from the top two at the time and poised to move
into contention when he stumbled badly and unseated the rider.

Footnotes
SPRING HEELED JIM (IRE) allowed them all to lead the way, sitting last for the first mile. In the early going, at fence two, he did take a bad step but
recovered quickly. Maintained its last place positioning until edging up one more spot when they came down the hill. At that point he was third behind the
two leaders, ETERNAL STORY and BEOWULF. Those two were in a blazing duel down the lane until the last jump. Once cleared, the gelding made a
sharp cut to his left and surged past the leaders with a hundred yards to the finish and won going away. ETERNAL STORY (FR) sat in mid-pack, not much
of a threat for the first mile of the race. It was when ANCIENT TIMES fell at the seventh face that he inherited the lead and was later joined by BEOWULF.
Together that pair exchanged leads with each jump until they hit the top of the lane. With three hurdles to go BEOWULF out jumped him which hurt his
advantage, but he recovered. After the last fence they were virtually inseparable, and although both bested by another, ETERNAL STORY narrowly bested.
BEOWULF (IRE) who didn't show much early but not unlike his for above, he became more of a contender around fence 8. Up Heartbreak Hill and down
toward the stretch they were locked together. Finished as hard as he could, game and resilient, but out matched. LOWCOUNTRY loomed on the shadow of
ANCIENT TIMES as long as he was in the race. He stalked him throughout and after ANCIENT TIMES stumbled LOWCOUNTRY was never able to make
the most of that error to better their positioning. He continued in contention until the last 5/8ths where he was getting outrun. Made a final bid in the last
eighth but they were just too good to catch. ANCIENT TIMES led the entire way and the jock had him in hand and looked like he had plenty under them.
When they hit the seventh fence, he didn't quite clear it and unseated the rider. Horse was walked off.

Footnotes
FRENCH LIGHT (FR) sat behind his three foes letting them dictate the terms early. In no rush for the first mile and a half of the event, with six furlongs
remaining he found a terrific spurt of energy and as the two were driving head and head it was in the final steps he drew clear. DECISIVE TRIUMPH out to
the front from the drop of the flag and had a comfortable lead with it slowly increasing their margins until they heis the straight and although finghting and
refusing to yield, he was just caught by the inside horse, FRENCH LIGHT. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) Not much of a factor overall but did try to contend
early, sitting a shadow's length away from the leader until they hit the 2 mile marker and wasn't much of a factor. Pulled up at fence 11 and walked off. MR.
ALEC was a mid-pack player here and never fired on all cylinders; after leaping over the 8th fence, they slowed, and once they hit the clubhouse turn for the
second circuit, he pulled up and was vanned off.

FREDDY FLINTSHIRE Raced evenly for the first circuit around the track and maintained an inside positioning throughout; came up strong on the far inside
after the last fence with a burst of speed no one could catch here. HURTGEN FOREST Went immediately to the front and led by a myriad of margins, the
largest at one point 15 lengths. Attempt to challenge from PROVEN INNOCENT was thwarted and at one point it seemed the winner was going to be
rebuked. However, their lead was slowly whittled away and had to settle for second behind the fastest closer in the race. KING OF TSAVO (GB) Was well of
the pace, beating only one other and remained there for over a mile and a half before putting him into gear and at the top of the stretch, after the last fence,
was in contention only one length from the lead. Worked hard through the lane but was not able to catch the top two. PROVEN INNOCENT Made a bid from
the start to be an early factor when midway through the event others got the better of this runner and he couldn't contend. PENICILLIN SUCCESS Raced in
fourth from start to straight, only to then fade to PROVEN INNOCENT. WEBB Trailed first circuit, had a difficult stumble on fence two with nose to the
ground and then, an impressive recovery. Maintained his last place positioning The later stumbled after fence 6 unseating rider. Walked off.

Footnotes
BOLD QUEST couldn't have gotten a cleaner and better trip. From the drop of the flag he found his place behind the leader and went along for the ride.
BOLD QUEST was always relatively close and a Bonafide contender. Being a contender is now over as he graduated from this hurdle career, and here he
went from contender to winner. CAINUDOTHETWIST Raced far back letting everyone else lead the way. Allowed to settle without disruption for most of the
going. When approaching the last fence and stretch, a new gear was found and clearing rivals proved fruitful. SEVILLE BARBER Took control of this race
from the start and led through right before the final turn when he tired some but found another burst of energy but everything changed after that last fence
when ALWAYS COOL stumbled. MEKONG Sat about five or more lengths behind the leaders and then faded in the last quarter mile. ALWAYS COOL
Seemingly a threat to close, ALWAYS COOL rated this field well and made their move over the second to last fence while narrowing the gap he had from
the leader. Ove the last jump, however, he took a bad stem, rider hung on with great effort but was ultimately dropped.
