WAYPOINT saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two and three path while racing
around the turn, took the lead entering the stretch and dueled down the lane, prevailing to the wire. TIN DELAY raced in the three path around the first turn,
began a early move on the outside entering the backstretch, took the lead between horses from there, angled in to save ground around the far turn and
dueled gamely down the stretch but was denied by the winner. CUSTOM KAT raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leaders on the outside
up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path, gained some mild ground in upper stretch and chased the top two home from there. ARCTIC
ROSE led the field while saving ground around the first turn, dropped back to press the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground
around the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. MY GUITAR saved ground around the first turn, moved to the outside to chase the frontrunners
up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two and three path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there.

MADAME JANE dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle three wide around the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and held that
margin to the wire. EVE'S DELIGHT bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead up the backstretch, raced two
wide around the turn and chased the eventual winner home, the best of the rest. TUGBOAT raced in tight quarters on the rail in the early going, dueled
inside up the backstretch and around the turn, and was outkicked in the final furlong while finishing evenly. MY SWEET SOPHIA trailed the field up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, offered a mild bid approaching the quarter pole and flattened out from there. TENSAS VIRGINIA bumped
with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and was empty in
the stretch.

MY GIRL SWEET hopped up and was steadied leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while
saving ground around the turn, and raced gamely down the stretch, bearing out at the eighth pole but holding her margin to the wire. STOP SHOP N DROP
chased the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and chased the winner gamely home, but
could not get by that rival. MAC LEGACY was away from the gate sharply, settled back to stalk the frountrunners on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane, the best of the rest. CUPIE CUTIE raced off the pace on
the inside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path, improved position in upper stretch and finished evenly. HAIRTRIGGER HEART bumped
with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly
between horses. HER GREAT GRANDPA raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, began a bid from the four path coming off the turn and
gained ground mildly on the outside from there. SWIFT N' STORMY tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
began to tire and bore out near the eighth pole and weakened further in the final furlong. MY DEPOSIT bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the
gate, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and passed tiring horses on the rail to the wire.
ROUX BANDIT dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and faded on the rail in the
stretch. ALLEN'S JUDY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and tired from there. TANTALIZING TEN was bumped and forced to steady leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders on the
outside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and tired entering the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, NO SPLITS

Footnotes
FLAT OUT AMERICAN raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began to move up while racing
in the three path around the far turn, angled in while taking over passing the quarter pole and held his margin to the wire. KING DOODLE raced in the two
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid between horses racing in the two path around
the turn, steadied slightly entering the stretch when FLAT OUT AMERICAN angled into his lane and chased that rival down the lane. FAHAN dueled for the
lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, gave way entering the stretch and
drifted out in the final furlong. HYPERBOLIST saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and came up empty from there. DIXIE STAR was bumped and squeezed back leaving the gate, saved
ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two and three path and offered no bid. THAT
ONE GUITAR dueled for the lead from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the
far turn and continued to tire from there. BOTH THE TRAINER AND RIDER OF KING DOODLE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE
WINNER, FLAT OUT AMERICAN, CITING INTERFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE
TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

to began a bid coming off the turn and gained ground on the outside to pull clear in the final furlong. TRIPPER JOHN tracked the leaders on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid while racing four wide around the turn, took over entering the stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and
chased the winner home. HENNING raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, improved position in upper
stretch and continued to gain ground late. CARLOS PUNCH dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around turn and
finished evenly. MR. CURLIN stalked the leaders on the inside in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn and was outkicked from there.
OAK HILL LG chased the pacesetters on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and weakened in the final furlong.
