Footnotes
CURLIN BLESSING was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenth marker and
drew off through the lane with complete authority. WHISTLING HOME chased the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, could not gain on the
winner in the drive but finished willingly to regain the place. FAT AND FURIOUS raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a
striking position but failed to gain in the drive. AUTISM PRISM sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace and weakened after
going three-quarters. I AM YOURS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened.

challenged by HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY with a furlong to run, vied with that rival and gamely prevailed. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was reserved just off the
leaders early, advanced five-wide through the second turn, offered a bid with a furlong to run, vied with the winner but could not get by that foe in the drive.
GUARDING ELK CAMP pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. STARLIGHT TWIST settled off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. LILA'S LUCKY LADY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was

Footnotes
SUNRISE IN THE BAR was away in good order to duel for the early advantage with SONGOFTHEDESERT, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and
held sway to the wire. JOE'S PASSION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner but finished
well to gain the place. BONITA RAPIDS was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and
finished with good energy. TOP LADY MARGIE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
SONGOFTHEDESERT broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and gave way late.
