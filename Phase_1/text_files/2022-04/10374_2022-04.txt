Footnotes
HONOR STRIKE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. LIGHTNING STAR chased
the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. BENISSIMO showed no early speed, saved ground
through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with some late run. ATLATL settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through
the
second
turn
and
finished
evenly.
LUGIA
lacked
early
speed,
saved
ground
through
the
second
turn
and
did
not
threaten.
BARELYSTILLCOUNTS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and failed to menace.
ASSURANCE was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. SHADYFIED showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and
weakened.

Footnotes
WHERE'S FRANKIE was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, quickly opened a
clear margin and was ridden out to be kept to task. DOZO broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with HOLY TUTTA BELLA while racing three-wide,
was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. CHEROKEE PAPOOSE raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and finished
with good energy. LE TUB was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. HOLY TUTTA BELLA disputed the pace
with DOZO from the inside and weakened after going a half. RED BOTTOM REBEL was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved three-wide through
the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ASSETS INCLUDED was away in good order to press the pace of SHIFTY DANCER while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
five-eighths marker, opened a clear margin with three furlongs to run and held sway to the wire. VALLEY WILDCAT was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. MARDEN settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn
and finished with some late run. ALBANY FRONT raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late.
SHIFTY DANCER broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. MONTANA JACK raced five-wide
through the first turn, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. TEN CARAT ROCK lacked early foot, saved ground
through the second turn and did not threaten. RUN FOREVER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
ASTRONOMICAL broke sharply to stalk the pace of PERFECT DUDE while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore that rival
down in the closing yards. PERFECT DUDE sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control through mid-stretch but
could not resist the winner late. KOWBOYKABIN was reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn and finished evenly in the
drive. PAYNTER'S BOY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to threaten. DIAMOND
RIM raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. MACCHIATO D'ORO was forwardly placed
early, moved six-wide through the second turn and gradually weakened. YHA YHA was void of early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was
not a factor.
