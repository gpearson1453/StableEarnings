Footnotes
TENGO SED was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced off the inside around the far turn through the stretch, dug in late and prevailed under all out
pressure. FREESTONE was coaxed along early from the outside, raced four to five wide in the stretch, angled in and closed gamely. CRYIN' CHUCK
stalked the pace, moved up four wide through the far turn and kept on to the wire. INDIAN GAMBLER was hustled along while racing between rivals around
the far turn through the stretch, forced to check near the eighth pole as Freestone angled in, a jockey objection and stewards inquiry was filed against
Freestone and stewards ruled no change. NOT NECESSARILY dropped back early on, raced widest through the lane and had no late rally. CLEVER EMMA
was hustled from the inside and tired.

CLUB MESQUITE was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, was well clear at the eighth pole and held well to
prove best under strong handling. JOKER MATT stalked the early pace, raced five wide around the first turn, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths
pole and finished second best. BUDDY NINER was allowed to settle early on, moved up three to four wide but had not enough for the top pair. SPEEDING
STYLE was forwardly placed to lay up close and weakened while racing three wide. FAST GALLITO was slow early, raced four to five wide through the
upper stretch and never threatened. HONOR STRIKE set all the pace from the inside and gave way. FIRST COUNT stalked the pace and tired readily the
final quarter of a mile.

the pack early, raced three to two in the stretch run and moved up. SEMI SWEET was slow early, raced five to six wide through the upper lane and made a
good late gain. MY FIRST PEARL stalked the pace and weakened while racing between rivals. SHE'S SMART ENOUGH pressed the early pace while
racing between rivals and tired. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER showed good early speed to set the pace and gave way.
