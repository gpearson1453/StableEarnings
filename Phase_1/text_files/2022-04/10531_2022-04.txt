LITTLE BITOTHUNDER was off the early pace saving ground, moved up inside through the far turn, angled into the lane and was up between rivals late.
JUDGE'S BRIBE stalked the leaders three and four wide to bid into the lane but was outfinished for position late. INEWAGALLIKETHAT was on the pace
inside a rival to move clear into the far turn, was joined by the top pair in the lane and dug in but could not hold late. PRINCE B saved ground and lacked a
rally. HANDY HANNON prompted the early pace outside INEWAGALLIKETHAT and weakened in the far turn. CHIEF TY HE failed to mount a bid three and
four wide. P R WHY NOT hesitated and lunged at the break to come away last and trailed.

the drive. LOOKING FOR BULL moved up four wide but could not threaten late. WATER PATROL was not a threat three wide. KID'S MISCHIEF moved up
outside the winner going up the backstretch to reach even terms between calls and could not sustain the effort. CONVICT PIKE saved ground and was not

saved ground back off the early leaders, angled out into the lane then drifted some through the midstretch while closing the gap on the winner. IRISH

run. BEHOLD THAT WORD moved up three wide into the lane but could not reach the top ones. DAKAMO ROSE gained inside position and made the pace
to upper stretch then had little left late. ATOKA GIRL failed to mount a bid three wide. STREETTALKINHOTTIE followed the pace three wide, angled in on
