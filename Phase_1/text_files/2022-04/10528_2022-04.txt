Footnotes
LONDON GOLD coaxed from the gate, crossed to show the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits uncontested, remained patiently handled
under very light coaxing through the turn, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside
and held on to prevail. STORMI CAT LADY broke out at the start bumping SUDDEN IMPULSE in concert with MIDMON, came under coaxing and chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive whittling away at the leader but was ultimately
repelled at the finish. GAGLIANO coaxed from the gate, chased five wide under a ride from three furlongs out, tipped six wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to secure the show honors. SIMPLE SUGAR coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SUDDEN IMPULSE bobbled at the break and was bumped between foes who each broke her way
conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased just off the inside, came under coaxing offering up a bid three furlongs from home,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. GAME THEORY coaxed from the start, chased four wide under a ride from midway on
the turn, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired. MIDMON broke in at the start bumping SUDDEN IMPULSE in tandem with STORMI CAT LADY,
chased five then four wide growing detached at the tail of the field, came under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued four to five wide for home and
trailed.

Footnotes
U SHOULD B DANCING was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, settled on the outside, went three wide for most of the turn then shifted four wide,
rallied six wide into upper stretch, closed strongly while remaining on her inside lead to take the advantage inside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper
lead shortly thereafter and proved best under good handling. LISA'S VISION was forced out at the start and off a half-step slow while corrected by the rider,
settled in the front half of the field on the outside, drafted in the two path around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, came out while roused for more
inside the three-sixteenths, rallied to the lead while dropping back closer to the rail outside the furlong marker and was overtaken by the winner while clear
for the place. VOLEUSE stood in the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up under urging then settled off the pace, saved ground
through the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, followed the runner-up into the final furlong and finished willingly for the show. MISS MALALA broke out
at the start, settled near the back, saved ground for most of the turn then shifted three wide, came five wide into the stretch and improved position.
SINFULLY SWEET bumped lightly with a foe at the start then was hustled, was well placed just off the pace on the inside of a foe, chased in the two path
around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch under a drive, was carried out inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. CINDY'S CHOICE broke out at
the start, settled on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BUNTY
WINDERMERE went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was roused for more into the stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and
gave way. LOLLYGAG bumped lightly with an opponent at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn and failed to respond. BIG BEAN
CHRISTINE tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up empty. MISS
FLINTSHIRE leaned in and brushed the gate then bumped the hindquarters of a foe, settled at the rear on the outside, went three wide for most of the turn
then dropped to the rail and was no factor.

Footnotes
DUTCHESS OF N Y went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, raced inside around the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch then fought
back well on the inside of foes, regained the lead in the final sixteenth and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. MY DELICIOUS raced just off the pace,
bumped with the loose horse at the half-mile pole, made a bid while four then three wide around the turn, took a narrow advantage into upper stretch, led
under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied while able to get the place. EXACT CHANGE acted-up just before the gate opened and was off a
couple lengths slow, raced on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, gained to make a bid around the five-sixteenths, battled outside of the top
two in the stretch and missed but earned the show. MILL STONE CREEK was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground through the turn, shifted to the
two path in upper stretch, chased the leading trio into the final sixteenth, altered out behind those foes late and finished with good energy but missed the
trifecta. THATSJUSTLOVELY was rated off the pace, dropped back when the loose horse joined the fray near the half-mile pole, went two to three wide for
most of the turn then shifted four wide, came out a bit more into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. WORK IT OUT was bumped in the
hindquarters at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was taken in hand when the loose horse came by leaving the backstretch, went around the
turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. GRANDMA T broke a step slow, settled on the outside, went six then five wide on
the turn and had nothing left. TWENTY TWO ELLE hit the inside of the gate at the start then stumbled before bumping a foe and unseated the rider.
HALF-MILE AND FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO THE LOOSE HORSE TRIPPING THE SENSORS EARLY

HALF BIRTHDAY coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader advancing through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took over command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole and held sway to the finish
kept busy to the end. TEMPERMENTAL chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and closed well to secure the place honors. BOCA KITTEN coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked
inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to procure the show honors. DOROTHY'S
THE BOSS four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled three
to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. RAYMOND ROAD coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PLAYMAGGIEFORME broke out at the start bumping
OURLADYOFVICTORY, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. OVER THE SAND
chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, tired. LOST ANCHOR showed the way in hand along the
inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front and cut the corner into upper stretch, then tired in the drive. UNBRIDLED'S REIGN got
clipped behind at the start by OURLADYOFVICTORY when that rival was bumped by PLAYMAGGIEFORME, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. OURLADYOFVICTORY got bumped at the start by PLAYMAGGIEFORME, who
broke outwards, and then clipped the back of UNBRIDLED'S REIGN bobbling and conceding five to six lengths to the front, strode gingerly early on and was
placed to a protective hold and guided outside before being pulled up near the nine-sixteenths, then was escorted by outrider and walked off under her own
power.

Footnotes
FORESTWOOD LANE three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch, rallied through
the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. BIG CASTLE five then four wide in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch taking command straightened away, dug in under a drive under lone threat
and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. BREAKING STONES coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, tipped out with seven-sixteenths to go
to the four path placed to coaxing midway on the turn, went five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then kept on to preserve the show
honors. HOBOKEN JACK broke in at the start and was hustled from the gate to thread through some rivals to show the way early on in the two path, got
displaced from command with five and a half furlongs to go and tipped three wide soon after, advanced into the turn to take back the front at the
seven-sixteenths and showed the way through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat
and relented straightened away, then weakened in the late stages. LITTERBOX chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four
to five wide for home and offered no response. FOTIS chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. COACH BAHE grew detached at the tail of the field
early on and chased three then two wide, went just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. HALPERT hustled from the gate, raced forwardly
placed four wide early on before advancing to take command with five and a half furlongs to go, tucked three then two wide nearing the half mile pole and
was placed to urging at that station as HOBOKEN JACK advanced outside, yielded the front at the seven-sixteenths and faded coaxed along through the
turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the wire.

Footnotes
PIPELINE broke out and bumped with a foe, moved to the lead while in hand then set the pace under pressure to his outside, controlled the action while
inside to the two path around the turn, extended the advantage while roused approaching the quarter-pole, drew off under a strong drive into the final
sixteenth then was eased up late while much the best. JERRY THE NIPPER showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path
around the turn and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. UNCLE MOONLIGHT bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged
along off the pace, moved out outside the half-mile pole, went three then four wide on the turn and just missed the place while able to get the show. ROCCO
STRONG brushed with a rival at the start, was coaxed along off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under stronger encouragement, went three wide around
the turn, dropped to the two path at the quarter-pole and came up empty. GOOD CULTURE hit the gate at the start and was off a step slow, dropped well
behind under urging, rounded the turn in the two path, came out a bit into the stretch, drifted out twice in the drive and was no factor. CARROTHERS
bumped with rivals on both sides at the start, settled off the pace, saved ground through the turn and came up empty. BASSO was urged along off the pace,
went four wide on the turn, dropped to three wide at the quarter-pole and failed to respond.
