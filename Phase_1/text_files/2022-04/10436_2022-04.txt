APPEALING SENORITA surged to bid three deep on the turn dueling abreast rival down the stretch extending clear at the end. DISCREET ENERGY
pressed the pace wresting a short lead from between horses on the turn dueling inside of rival down the lane ceding grudgingly in the closing yards.
TREASURE WILBURNYA slow early lagged to upper stretch mustering enough there to best the others. WELLOILEDCAT slow early trailed to upper stretch
finishing evenly four wide there. CRYPTONIC CATWALK pressed with early speed fading from the three eighths pole inside. SANIBEL pressed the pace to
mid turn then weakened brushing the rail checking near the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
FREE SAILIN stalked the pace pressing to lead along the inside nearing the quarter pole shaking clear in upper stretch widening late as much the best.
PERFECT SENSE slow early lagged through the turn then responded in upper stretch coming on belatedly to save place. GOOD IDEA gained on the turn
extending off a loose leader in the three path upper stretch hanging in the closing yards. SCARED WARIOR raced evenly through the turn to upper stretch
continuing with steady response there to finish well. BEACH FRONT advanced while racing wide on the turn then weakened near mid track the final eighth.
JOHN'S ROCK slow early played no factor. BREEZY MONEY was never involved. LADY'S BOY away alertly set the early pace being engaged on the turn
giving way abruptly along the inside in upper stretch.

HENRY MAC a step slow through the turn came five wide down the lane surging late arriving in time. MIDNIGHT WARSHIP pressured the pace shaking
clear on the turn digging in from the three path down the lane shortening stride late being grabbed from the outside. BIG ON BIG dropped off on the turn
racing four path down the lane surging late. BISCUITS AND GRITS pressured the pace chasing on the turn saving ground to upper stretch fading late along
the inside. JUST TAPIT IN was never involved. LUCKY STREAK played no factor.

Footnotes
HAIL TO HELEN stalked early rallying clear on the turn, put away inside challenge upper stretch drawing out late. FAST TRANSIT set the pace being
passed on the turn saving ground extending from the rail in upper stretch proving no match late saving place. HADLEN broke slowly lagging through the
turn, hit stride on the inside in upper stretch finishing strong. KIMALLOSA'S HALO bid on the turn then weakened in upper stretch. GREEDY ALGORITHM
slow early played no factor. MY D'VALENTINE chased the pace through the turn then faded in upper stretch. EXCEEDING was never involved. MY TOMMY
LEE a step slow through the turn was checked between horses near the eighth pole. TELL ME A SECRET was always outrun.
