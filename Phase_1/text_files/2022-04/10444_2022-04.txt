Footnotes
IZANAMI vied three wide for the early lead, battled on into the turn, shook free to a slim lead near the quarter pole, kept to task under a drive along the rail in
the lane and held clear. FLAT ROSE settled off the top trio in early stages, picked up the pace around the turn, angled in a couple paths under steady urging
and sustained a solid bid for second best. MSCHITCHATTOUR raced in the back through the early going, hustled up three wide around the turn, was ridden
along four wide into the upper stretch and stayed on to prevail for a share. MISS MIRACLE GIRL was well placed tracking the embattled trio in early stages,
launched a three wide bid around the turn, raced in contention then flattened in the final furlong. TABLE ONE chased the pace along the inside and failed to
move into close contention. SLEWPY'S HALO vied inside of rivals for the lead through the backstretch, battled on into the turn, could not maintain equal
terms near the quarter pole and gave way. MY LITTLE DIVA dueled three deep for the early lead, fought back to the quarter pole then came up empty.

Footnotes
ROMANTIC BEAST was well placed tracking the top pair near the inside, was ridden along two then three wide around the turn, came under left handed
urging at the head of the lane, tipped wider for the drive, prompted right handed at the eighth pole, found another gear, surged to command and finished
going away. COLD HEARTED WENCH pressed the pace through the backstretch, dueled outside of DOBBY SUE around the turn, battled on into the final
furlong then failed to be a match when the winner surged by. DOBBY SUE set a pressured pace through the backstretch, dueled inside of COLD HEARTED
WENCH around the turn, battled back into the lane then got overtaken by the winner in the final furlong and weakened to show. LIZZ A BEE raced inside
just off the early leaders, launched a rail bid around the turn, cut the corner into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SWEET AMELIA raced off the early
pace, saved ground through the turn, tipped a path wider for the drive and failed to threaten. GILDED APPLE chased the pace two wide into the turn, was
ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and failed to move on. A WISH FOR MADELYN hustled along in steady pursuit, raced three wide in range
around the turn then faded in the lane. TWN TAWFEERS PARTY raced off the pace, urged two wide around the turn and had no response.

Footnotes
COURTMAN dueled inside of PAPIRINGO from the onset, matched strides through the backstretch and battled on into the lane, fought back along the
inside, drifted out a path and bumped PAPIRINGO in the final sixteenth then straightened under a drive and battled for command to the wire. PAPIRINGO
vied for the lead with COURTMAN in opening stages, matched strides with rival through the backstretch and around the far turn, battled back gamely along
the outside, got bumped and knocked off stride by COURTMAN in the final sixteenth, stayed on gamely and battled back to the wire. LUCK OF THE STARS
tracked the embattled pair through the backstretch, launched a bid around the far turn, sustained a steady bid along the inside through the lane and
prevailed for a share. JIMMIE'S HALO tracked the pace through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid for the top pair near the quarter pole, sustained
a three to four wide bid through the lane but needed more for serious impact. CHIEF KIMOSABI raced off the early pace, hustled up four to five wide in the
lane and showed some interest in final stages. IRON FORTUNE raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and had no response. ORGERON was off
a step slow at the start then pulled while keen and steadied into the first turn, settled into contention through the backstretch then came up empty around the
final turn. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY COURTMAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERNCE IN DEEP

Footnotes
ZYDECO MUSIC was rated under slight restraint just off the early leader, let out a notch and cleared command at the three eighths pole, angled inside in
the upper stretch, widened to a clear advantage and finished ridden out in late stages. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO tracked the early pace along the outside,
launched a three wide bid around the turn, sustained a solid bid through the lane and finished second best. AMERICAN REBEL raced outside in early
contention, hustled along three wide through the turn, stayed on three to four wide in the lane and secured a share. TOTAL MALICE was not too far back in
the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn, sustained response into the final furlong then ran on evenly. JENNIFER'S ARCH quickly cleared
the lead and angled inside, set the pace then got collared by the winner entering the turn, continued in range into the upper stretch then gave way. KICK N
KISS was a bit slow into stride, urged three wide to four wide and improved position without threatening. SANDY SANGRIA chased in contention through
the backstretch, failed to progress under urging around the turn then retreated in the lane. UPGRADE ME raced off the pace, was ridden along two wide
through the turn and failed to move into contention. LUCKY LINZ raced in contention through early stages then retreated. BLONDIE LOX BABE raced off
the pace, saved ground and dropped back in the lane.

Footnotes
SUGAR STAR was not too far back racing along the rail through early stages, stayed inside through the turn then given cue four wide at the head of the
lane, responded under firm handling and edged clear in late stages. MO BELLA raced up close three wide then moved up into striking distance late on the
turn, roused forward to a slim lead mid-stretch, stayed on gamely under firm handling then got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. CALL ME
DARLIN was stubborn to load then came away in good order, prompted the early pace then dueled around the turn, remained in striking distance into the
final furlong then yielded to show. GOODBYE ROSIE raced in range through into the turn, sustained a four wide into the upper stretch and needed more for
serious impact. ZIPITY raced in close contention then moved up along the rail late on the turn, raced in striking distance along the inside in the upper stretch
flattened in the final furlong. SUNSET FLASH raced in the back, hustled up four to five wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. BOSTON PROSPECT
set a pressured pace, dueled for the lead around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
GUITAR DOCTOR vied for the lead with BASEBALL LOVER in opening stages then shook clear and held firm through the turn, dug in along the rail under
firm handling and held on. BASEBALL LOVER vied for the early lead then conceded position to GUITAR DOCTOR, chased inside in close contention
around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, stayed on determinedly and just missed. JANET'S DEVIL chased the top pair through early stages, remained
in close contention around the turn and sustained a solid three wide bid through the lane. STAR AND A HALF raced three to four wide in range around the
turn, came out wider for the drive and needed more for serious impact. NINEJUANJUAN CALL hustled up two to three wide around the turn, angled to the
rail at the furlong marker and ran on evenly. SCORING DRIVE raced off the early pace, came four wide into the lane and failed to rally. GRAHAM 'S
CRUISER broke out and brushed with rival at the start, was ridden along off the early pace, came two wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
LUMBERJACK EMPIRE raced near midpack then launched a bid near the three eighths pole, dueled inside of CONSERVATVE VALUES into the stretch
run, dug in gamely from the inside and edged away in deep stretch. CONSERVATVE VALUES tracked the pace through the backstretch, made a move
entering the turn, dueled outside of LUMBERJACK EMPIRE down the lane and failed to match strides in the final sixteenth. IGNITE THE PASSION raced
near midpack, hustled up three wide around the turn, churned on through the lane and secured a share. MON DANSEUR vied for the early lead, briefly held
on top then got collared by outside duo mid-way through the turn and gave way. BABY LOCKOUT was slow into strides and lagged in the back, tucked
inside around the turn and improved position without threatening. IT'S TIME BABY raced off the pace, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch and
never threatened. STERLING MEMORY raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane and never menaced. TWO PUNCH FIST vied for the early lead
then came up empty around the turn. LA LOLA raced near midpack then retreated.
