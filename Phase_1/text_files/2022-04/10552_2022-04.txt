Footnotes
SINFULICIOUS stalked outside the early leaders, ranged up three wide to take over going comfortably past the quarter-pole, and spurted clear through
some rein shakes and crop flashes ridden out. KING'S LEGACY prompted HOTTER THAN JULY from outside, lodged a bid between that one and
SINFULICIOUS approaching the stretch, and finished willingly to be second best. LINN PIER saved ground on the turns in midpack, moved to the two-path
at the top of the lane and was up inside TORA LORA LORA for the show. TORA LORA LORA failed to menace through a three-wide trip. HOTTER THAN
JULY set the pace inside, faced a two-pronged challenge turning for home, and gave way. LIGEIA faded after a half-mile. PRETTYASAPENNY broke
slowest, then steadied off heels a few strides after that, and never factored. SUNFLOWER ROAD was outrun two to three wide. STELLARATOR was never
prominent toward the inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SPIN RATE tracked the pace two wide between foes, tipped three wide turning for home, moved to the front near the sixteenth pole, dueled outside of
MAYOR REMO from there and prevailed. MAYOR REMO set the pace in the two path, dug in inside of the winner through the final furlong and just missed
in a game try. SUPERPOSITION raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. DOUBLE BLESSING failed to menace while racing three wide.
JUST SO YA KNOW was fractious in the gate, hit the gate to get away near the back, raced well back two and three wide and passed tiring rivals in the
lane. POLITICAL RIOT pressed the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. NO DRAMA was off slow and never a threat while
racing four wide. SWEENEY'S CAT chased the pace three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. CLASSIC FILM was outrun inside. SIMILAR
TASTE was up close inside and retreated nearing the lane. WILLIAM BOY saved ground in midpack and had no response.

Footnotes
SADE PURSE was slowest underway, advanced to midpack up the backstretch inside, moved out three wide zeroing in on the dueling leaders past the
midway point on the turn, wrested command outside TRIPLE P leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. THE JOKES ON ME was outsprinted early,
fanned six wide coming off the turn, and rallied on the far outside to pick up the place late. TRIPLE P went up to engage LADY YOUNES from outside after
a quarter-mile, went clear approaching the top of the stretch, could not handle the winner past the eighth-pole and just saved the show spot. IRISH
SAMURAI bumped with BLAME THE MEDIA at the start, and raced evenly three to four wide. SAY NO MORE settled in the middle of the field two wide to
the stretch, moved inside and could not gain. RIDE LITTLE GIRL raced widest throughout and never factored. BLAME THE MEDIA bumped with IRISH
SAMURAI at the start, stayed in range early, and faded five wide into the lane. RAVEN'S HARLAQUEEN raced far back inside. FIVE K KITTEN was never
close, and steadied going around LADY YOUNES at the top of the stretch. LADY YOUNES sped clear early, was joined by TRIPLE P at the half-mile pole,
vied inside that one through the turn, then was pulled up into the stretch and vanned off. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FIVE-FURLONG FRACTION
UNAVAILABLE.

BATTLE CRY tracked the pace between rivals down the backstretch, angled to the rail near the three-eighths pole, angled three wide leaving the quarter
pole, rallied outside, seized command nearing the eighth pole and quickly cleared. EMIRATES AFFAIR vied outside of OUR FANTASY in the three path,
took a narrow lead nearing the quarter pole, led to midstretch and but was no match for the winner from there. OUR FANTASY disputed the pace in the two
path, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. HEIRESSINDY had her head turned at the start, advanced outside down the backstretch, chased
four wide around the turn and faded in the lane. CAPTURINI led down the chute and was through early. CELESTIAL CHEETAH advanced inside down the
backstretch but was done after a half.

Footnotes
OLLIEMEISTER advanced around the turn in the four-path, joined the leaders past the quarter-pole, took over outside MOVING PICTURES through
midstretch and drew off staying on his left lead. MOVING PICTURES vied in the two-path inside BLOURBON READY, got the best of that skirmish in upper
stretch, was unable to fend off the winner and ran on clearly second best. BOURBON READY argued the pace outside MOVING PICTURES for a half-mile,
weakened after straightening away for the drive and remained clear of the rest. WIN NO JOKE bumped with FAST FLIGHT at the start, paused briefly while
hesitant to go up inside MOVING PICTURES early, stayed on the rail and lacked the needed response. NO CODE was no factor three wide. FAST FLIGHT
bumped with WIN NO JOKE at the start, and faded in the three-path after a half-mile. UNION OF THOUGHTS was slow into stride, raced outside and never
got close.

GATHER AS YOU GO sprinted clear, set the pace in the two path, allowed the field to catch up around the far turn responded to bids around the turn,
kicked clear again in upper stretch, and dug in to repel the runner-up's late challenge. R CALLI KIM steadied into the first turn, raced two wide in midpack,
edged closer three wide around the far turn, rallied outside and was gaining late. MIDNIGHT BELLA saved ground in midpack, swung five wide nearing the
eighth pole and rallied for the show. BALLYMORE STAR (IRE) raced closest to the winner two and three wide, bid nearing the lane, appeared to be trying to
lug in through the stretch and was outfinished. STARSHIP MALLOMAR saved ground off the early pace, advanced inside down the backstretch, bid inside
of the winner to get within a half-lengths midway around the turn but could not sustain that run. KATE'S KINGDOM lacked early speed while racing two
wide, went five wide around most of the far turn, came eight wide into the lane and improved position. SOUPER ALL STAR raced off the pace three wide,
steadied near the three-eighths marker and never threatened. MIDNIGHT DIVA saved ground in range early, went four wide around the far turn and faded.
ESKIMO'S BOSS failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CAUSINGAHULLBALOO raced four wide, was bumped entering the far turn and lacked
a bid. CAPSTONE GIRL was a bit rank while racing three wide between foes around the first turn, bumped entering the far turn, raced five wide around that
bend and came up empty in the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ONE EYED JACK saved ground close up around the turn, slipped through on the fence to challenge DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER into the stretch, battled
shoulder to shoulder through a long drive and gamely prevailed. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER argued the early pace inside rivals, was nursed along on a short
lead slightly off the inside around the turn, got hooked by ONE EYED JACK into the lane, responded willingly but was bested to the finish. MEADE settled in
midpack for six furlongs, swung four wide into the stretch and was up late for third on the far outside. LUSITANO set or forced the pace outside rivals four to
five wide for six furlongs, and weakened in the stretch. TONE FEELIN saved ground on the turn taking closer order, and improved mildly through the stretch
without threatening. HERE COMES BULLET pressed the pace between horses three wide, and weakened after six furlongs. DEVOTED KITTEN was no
menace four to five wide. PLATO was slow into stride, fanned six wide into the stretch, and tired. NACHO PAPA stumbled at the start, pressed the early
pace between horses, and gave way on the turn.

Footnotes
RISK MANAGER bumped with KANAAN at the start, saved ground for six furlongs, shifted to the two-path turning for home, rallied between horses in
midstretch, went back to the rail and was up in the closing yards. PUBLIC INFORMATION raced three wide in range to the stretch, bid outside rivals into the
final furlong, and was edged to the finish. DOMINATE THEMOMENT moved off the rail to press ISABELLA'S DREAM from outside into the backstretch,
gained command after six furlongs and edged clear, then was overhauled from both sides in deep stretch. SEVEN CHANNELS saved ground for six
furlongs, shifted two wide into the stretch, bid between horses through the furlong grounds but was outfinished from there. FUTURE VICTORY bumped with
ISABELLA'S DREAM at the start, was outrun two wide to the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and gained mildly for a share. KOBLA MAS had the
two-path on the turns at the back, and improved position through the stretch without making an impact. LAKER MAMBA made no impression racing in the
second flight. ISABELLA'S DREAM bumped with FUTURE VICTORY at the start, cleared to the lead and moved inward around the first turn, could not hold
off DOMINATE THEMOMENT after six furlongs, and retreated. EXUMA (IRE) broke two lengths slow, and was always outrun. CREATIVE KID pursued the
early pace, and tired approaching the stretch. KANAAN bumped with RISK MANAGER at the start, and never menaced. TERRAIN was finished early four
wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
COREY tracked the pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, put a head in front near the quarter pole, dueled outside of R ADIOS
JERSEY from there and edged ahead late. R ADIOS JERSEY set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole, continued on
the left lead in the lane, fought on inside to deep stretch and lasted for the place. RACE DAY SPEED raced off the pace five wide and finished well to just
miss second. DON'T GET KHOZY saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and had a mild rally. STARSHIP NALA settled off the pace outside
early, advanced four wide around the turn then weakened in the lane. CRUMB BUN stalked the pace three wide, steadied off heels near the three-eighths
pole, dropped back and lacked any further bids. AWESOME ANNMARIE broke in a tangle, was immediately taken widest, raced five to six wide around the
turn and never threatened. A CLAIM OF FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CRUMB BUN AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
AROUND THE FAR TURN WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
JAMES ALOYSIUS moved in from the five-path around the first turn, went up to take over from MOUNT RUNDLE midway up the backstretch and moved
further inward, settled into the stretch clear in the two-path, and held sway late while drifting out. MOUNT RUNDLE led early, yielded to JAMES ALOYSIUS
up the backstretch, went around to rebid from the three-path turning for home, could not reach the winner and was clearly second best. JINXED (IRE) saved
ground throughout while in range, but lacked the needed closing bid. VOCALIZE was no menace through a three-wide trip. KING SILVIO was reserved early
inside, and lacked the needed response when called on. SIR SAMUEL settled in the middle of the pack early, and had no rally. SPLENDID SUMMER
brushed the left side of the gate and was off behind the field, and remained well back. PIEER ROR was slow into stride, and never got close. GREAT
UNCLE was forwardly placed early three wide, and tired after a half-mile. HROTHGAR was in tight between foes in the four-path early on the first turn, and
was through before going a half. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
