Footnotes
DIXIELAND DANCER , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, was kept to her business in the stretch and eagerly drew away. SOME IS NINE ,
lapped outside the winner, chased that one throughout and was best of the others. COLOROFACLOUD , shuffled back about a furlong after the break,
saved ground around the turn and finished willingly. TIPSY TOURIST saved ground on the turn and weakened. ALY DID IT , swung outside shortly after the
start, remained wide around the turn and gave way. PEARLYVILLE raced along the inner rail on the turn while outrun. MY GIRL STEVE , swung four wide
leaving the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
WICKED PRANKSTER cleared early, set a rated pace towards the inside, opened up after being put to firm asking in upper stretch, kept on under right
handed rousing leaving the eighth pole then was under steady hand encouragement to hold firm. PRAYER HOPE rated inside foes, edged up near the half
mile marker, eased out entering the lane, gave futile chase but dug in gamely to save the place. LIGHTNING ROD settled early, moved up between foes
past the five eighths, waited briefly near the half mile marker, dropped in under pressure near the quarter pole, angled back out soon into the lane and
finished with interest. IRISHMAN , taken wide for the backstretch, rushed up five wide outside foes into the far turn, continued pursuit five wide from there
and churned on. LACCO AMENO broke a step slow, rated off the pace, angled four wide and had belated action. TITRATE rated behind foes, raced three
wide near the quarter pole and lacked a solid punch. LET ME FINISH , off the early pace, made a six wide run from the far turn to the quarter pole but failed
to seriously sustained in the stretch drive. SAMUI SUNSET , bumped and forced out a bit while four deep into the first turn, remained four wide while moving
up past the five eighths, chased wide and between runners past the five sixteenths then faded. NICKY BEAR , bumped between runners early, raced three
wide past the quarter pole but failed to generate a solid run. FAVORITE IMAGE , taken to rate from the gate, bumped between runners nearing the first turn,
moved up to stalk three wide, was under pressure to stay close past the five sixteenths then gave way through the drive. DASHING CIRCLES saved ground
stalking the pace, remained in contact into the far turn then faded. REBEL VICTORY stalked the winner while off the inside, was under a solid ride pursuing
between foes nearing the quarter pole, faltered leaving the three sixteenths and was eased late.

VOLNAY sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail and lasted under brisk urging. MARKETABILITY broke slowly, steadied lacking room near the
three eighths pole, raced in the two path on the turn and closed outside the winner. LOVE IS STRONG lacked speed, circled the turn four wide and lacked a
serious rally. ALL ABOUT AUDREY raced in the three path between horses mid way on the turn and gave way through the stretch. CORAL SUMMER
hugged the inner rail around the turn and faltered approaching the stretch. LA ALHAMBRA dropped back early.

RAGTIME BLUES accelerated to the front soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail throughout and was under urging in the drive. CLUBMAN ,
caught in tight quarters leaving the chute, swung five deep turning for home and rallied outside foes. SILENT MALICE lacked speed, raced four wide on the
turn, moved up to the eighth pole then flattened out. LOST IN MANHATTAN , four deep leaving the backstretch, chased the pace racing in the three path
around the turn and weakened in the drive. MAID THE JOURNEY , a forward factor early, saved ground around the turn and gave way approaching the
stretch. NO MORE TALK , in tight quarters along the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, dropped back entering the turn, swung six wide leaving the
turn and gave way. BREITHORN raced in the two path between horses on the turn while chasing the pace, faltered entering the stretch and was eased late.

Footnotes
B DETERMINED rated kindly while saving ground off the pace, moved up in hand while remaining inside into the far turn, sat patiently behind a rival near
the five sixteenths, angled three wide for room into the lane, responded to left handed asking and collared the leader near mid stretch, took command soon
after, battled outside ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR and kept that one at bay. ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR stalked to the inside of a rival, took closer order into the lane,
eased out and challenged between foes with a furlong to go, fought gamely to the inside of the winner from there but wasn't quite good enough.
COSMICALITY , keen to go and opened up early, set the pace towards the inside, was confronted heading to the eighth pole, stayed on a sixteenth more
then gave way grudgingly. FERMAT broke slowly, dropped in early and settled, eased out then moved up behind rivals leaving the far turn, checked sharply
when in tight soon into the lane, regrouped to split runners leaving the eighth pole and finished strong. SEA GHOST settled in the two path, was shuffled
back nearing the far turn, recovered and saved ground into the lane, slipped through past mid stretch and kept on trying. ROYAL CRUSADER lost ground
four wide, made a run from the half mile marker to the quarter pole, chased to mid stretch but came up empty late. BELTWAY BOB steadied at the break,
lagged back, angled out leaving the three eighths, came six wide for the drive but failed to rally. WAR LANCE , rank at the break, failed to menace. GREAT
IDEA rated in mid pack, moved up off the rail into the far turn, traveled between runners soon after, was checked in close quarters in upper stretch and
faded. BOONDOGGLE , three wide early, chased outside a rival into the far turn, stayed in range to the quarter pole then faltered.

DILLY DILLY PHILLY stalked the pace two wide around the turn, secured command in upper stretch then was kept under encouragement in the drive. SICK
PACK SARA sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and continued gamely. MAVILUS , two wide on the turn, eased
out to the three path in upper stretch and split rivals in mid stretch with a rally. CONGRESS HALL hugged the inner rail throughout out and was no threat.
RAVENEL circled the turn three wide, was fanned four wide turning for home and lacked a rally. GRACE ISABELLA raced in the two path around the turn
while chasing the pace and weakened. NANA'S SHOES trailed and swung five wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ROYAL NUMBER rated outside a rival and in range, came under some coaxing past the three eighths, angled three wide soon after and took aim of the
embattle leaders, bid four wide outside foes to take command soon into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch, kept on under strong handling
and prevailed. DUST DEVIL tracked the leaders while saving ground, was under a ride to hold position mid way on the final turn, swung out for a clear run
leaving the three sixteenths, straightened away, leveled off to his best stride inside the furlong grounds and finished up well to gain and nab the place.
CELTIC TREASURE took over soon after the break and secured the inside, set the pace under a light hold while shadowed by FULL COURT PRESS,
dueled with that one from the five sixteenths to upper stretch then continued on with good effort through the final furlong. FULL COURT PRESS moved up
into the first turn and prompted the pace outside CELTIC TREASURE, drew on near even terms leaving the three eighths, battled into the lane but had
nothing to give through the last eighth. TIZ MANDATE refused to break. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was deemed necessary.
