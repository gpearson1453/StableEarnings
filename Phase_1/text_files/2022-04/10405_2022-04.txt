BURNING DESIRE broke a step slow, racing in the rear, moved up on the inside around the final turn, angled out entering the stretch, made an outside rally
and drove clear before the wire. TURF DANCER sprinted to the front, drove clear, led until late, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear
second. ANGEL AND ME pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and finished evenly. MS. CAJUN QUEEN raced within contention, came around
the first turn on the outside, made a bid and weakened. SARATOGA PASODOBLE was an early factor, faded and lacked a late bid. I GOT WINGS raced
within striking distance, faded and had nothing late. THAT YOU MARGARET void of early speed and showed little. JUNIE always raced near the back and
was outrun.

PADDOCK PICK vied for the early lead, dueled around the turn with SR. CLARKY, drove clear down the stretch, was all out and held off a late challenge by
KING OF THE TESTO for the win. KING OF THE TESTO void of early speed, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide rally down the lane
and needed more ground. SR. CLARKY dueled on the front end, weakened and proved third best at the wire. CLASSIC GREELEY raced within striking
distance, faded and finished evenly. RUN AWAY SON raced near the back and was never a factor. SONOMA CRUSH always raced near the back and
showed little. MONYDONTSPENITSELF pressed the early pace and dropped back.

end, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for the win. SUMMER IS HOT raced within contention, made an inside bid and was outfinished, while
running a game third. VELVET NIGHT steadied around the first turn, while drifting out, raced near the back in the early part, made a late bid, steadied down
the home stretch, getting in tight quarters, angled in and went to the wire evenly. OUR LITTLE GIRL vied for the early lead and faded. BE A BANDIT
pressed the early pace and was finished early. CLOCKED IN TYME void of early speed and was never close. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO
THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

early lead, challenged throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. GOODROCKINALVIN broke a step slow, rushed up, vied for
the early advantage and lacked a late kick. WESTERN STAR raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. SHADY MONKEY
pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn, faded and finished evenly. ARGYBARGY BUCK lacked early speed and raced evenly near the back.
