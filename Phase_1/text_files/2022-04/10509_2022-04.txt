MUCHO VELOCE void of early speed, raced outside around the turn, was bumped down the stretch and got up late for the win. AUTUMN'S SUPER CED
challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late at the wire. SPEEDY G went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and was
outfinished, lacking a late kick. ORPHAN CREEK lacked early speed, moved up entering the home stretch, was bumped and squeezed out of contention,
being no factor at the wire. R T'S D'ORO raced near the middle of the pack, drifted out down the stretch, bumped rival and was no threat. T G'S NELSON
raced within contention and faded. ELIEZER raced in the middle of the field and dropped back. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS CALLED INTO THE

Footnotes
WILD MALLORY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and proved much the best. AREYOUINABAND pressed the pace, followed the winner, proved
no match, but was best of others. GALAXY THIRTYSIX void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. STARBUCK LUCK
raced within contention, evenly behind the top two and weakened down the home stretch. FORTY NINE MODEL raced near the middle of the field and
lacked a late bid. ROARING QUINN lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and showed little. SUMMERTIME BANDIT always raced near the
back and was outrun.

early advantage, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. TIGERBEACH lacked early speed, made a steady gain, proved no match for
the top two, but got up for third. DEALIN' STELEN raced in the back of the pack, made a wide gain and was outfinished for show. HONOR MY SPEED
raced in the middle of the field, saved ground and put forth an even effort. BIG FALCON ROCKET challenged for the early lead and was finished early.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE GUERA unhurried in the beginning, racing in the middle of the field, angled outside down the lane, made a wide bid and got up in time.
TAIPANS CHERRYBOMB pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead down the stretch and was caught late for the win. SOUVENIR
CHANNEL raced evenly near the back in the early going, made a mild bid, got up for third, but proved no match for the top two. PEPPER POINT lacked
early speed and passed tired ones. SONGS DISCREET CAT went to the front, drove clear and faded. GRACE'S VISION void of early speed and was never
close. LA SMOOCHIE pressed the early pace, saved ground and was finished early.
