Footnotes
FIVE STAR PHIL bumped with DESHACKLED when bumped and forced out by AMICALOLA FALLS leaving the starting gate, circled foes four deep on the
turn, drifted in approaching the eighth pole when sprinting clear then increased his advantage the final furlong. AMICALOLA FALLS bumped the winner
when bearing out at the break, raced in the two path between horses on the turn and in the stretch and finished willingly. LOADED SNIPER hugged the
inner rail on the turn, advanced inside horses to the eighth pole and weakened late. DESHACKLED , fractious in the starting gate, bumped with
AMICALOLA FALLS soon after the break, chased the pace while in the three path around the turn, raced on his left lead in the stretch drive and weakened.
DONTFORGETTOBLINK saved ground on the turn, raced inside horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. LIFESPAN , four wide on the turn, was not a
factor. ABHAR opened up a long lead setting the pace along the rail and faltered in mid stretch. NOT TELLING was outrun.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) took over early and was nicely rated towards the rail while handling some outside pressure, was nudged along to hold the advantage
past the five sixteenths, spurted away two wide under firmer asking soon into the lane, kept on under right handed encouragement through the final furlong
and held firm. BOSS LOGIC , brushed at the start, prompted the pace outside the winner, was pushed along leaving the five sixteenths, shifted in a bit
through the drive and stayed on well. STRIKING A POSE , three deep the first turn, raced between runners leaving the three eighths, shifted out under
pressure in upper stretch, straightened away and came on nicely through the final seventy yards. PRETTY GOOD YEAR , between runners near the seven
eighths, was urged to move up three deep nearing the far turn, chased outside rivals past the five sixteenths, shifted out wider in the drive but came up
empty. BUMPERDOO , well placed while saving ground, was shoved along chasing to the inside of rivals around the final turn but lacked a bid. BEYOND
THE VICTORY hopped at the break and was brushed to be away last, regrouped and moved up three wide to attend the pace, tracked three deep into the
far turn, was under a hearty ride to keep up past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way through the final furlong. MY GOOD
MAN lagged back while saving ground, eased off the inside past the three eighths, swung six wide into the lane but lacked a finishing kick.

Footnotes
LA CASA D'ORO stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up three deep on the turn, gained the lead outside VISBY in mid stretch and drove clear.
VISBY , a bit fractious in the starting gate, prompted the early pace outside SENSON, gained a short lead approaching the stretch, lost the advantage in mid
stretch and dug in gamely. SENSON bumped BEARGREASE when bearing out at the break, showed speed along the inner rail and weakened through the
stretch. BEARGREASE , bumped on both sides at the start, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path turning for home and weakened.
OCEAN TIME , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn. DETERMINED DREAM raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. SALLY BALI
bumped with BEARGREASE leaving the starting gate then trailed.

Footnotes
FRIAR TUCK , away alertly, prompted the pace outside two to three wide outside BOSS MAN J J, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, dueled from
the head of the lane, wandered outward a bit from left handed asking near mid stretch, wrested command with about a sixteenth remaining then eagerly
went clear under firm handling. BOSS MAN J J was hard sent from the inside to take command and go clear, set the pace towards the rail, met bids
approaching the stretch, drifted a bit soon after then dug in to battle past the furlong marker, could not quite match strides in the final seventy yards but
continued with good energy to the wire. TRUSTYOURINSTINCT , off a bit slow, was hustled along got within reasonable range while three wide past the
five sixteenths, worked between runners in mid stretch and churned on with interest. DUNE DUNE tracked the pace three to four wide, bid three deep
nearing the quarter pole, pressed briefly then faded in the final furlong. POWER BACK , well back early, raced between runners heading to the half mile
pole, came three wide for the drive and leveled off to a decent stride in the final seventy yards. SHACKLE CAT , well placed towards the inside, was under
pressure pursuing the leading trio into the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. STRANGE ARRANGE , off the pace three wide, angled
five wide for the drive and was not a factor. SILENT SERVICE , sluggish from the start, edged up four wide nearing the half mile marker, chased four wide
past the five sixteenths, had no response from there and retreated. FORTH , under rating while saving ground into the lane, swung out and failed to
respond.

REMEMBERING WILBUR showed speed in the two path between horses, disputed the pace to mid stretch then drove clear. FLOKI'S FLIGHT , steadied in
close quarters along the rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail and rallied gamely. BLISS THIS , bumped by OUR FREEDOM leaving the
starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, swung out for the drive and rallied mildly. STORIED FELLA disputed the pace in the three path between
horses around the turn, loomed outside the winner near the eighth pole then faded. GOLD GUY , four deep prompting the pace around the turn, gave way in
upper stretch. NIGHT BOSS lacked speed, was well off the rail on the turn and failed to be a factor. CLASSY UNION , six wide on the turn, failed to rally.
JUSTFORSPEIGHTOFIT was outrun. OUR FREEDOM came out and bumped BLISS THIS at the start, and raced wide around the turn. HE ROLLS , five
wide on the turn, gave way. DONDADA gave way on the turn.

YOU MUST CHILL moved up into the first turn and tracked a contested pace while three wide, was patiently handled spying the leaders past the five
eighths, cruised up to engage past the five sixteenths then kicked clear into the lane, opened up under strong left handed asks near mid stretch, was kept to
strong urging to the sixteenth pole then geared down in the final yards. ARMANDO R saved ground and settled off the embattled leaders, was under
pressure leaving the far turn, swung out four wide for the drive, leveled off near the eighth pole and finished up well. BENANDJOE moved up to the inside of
DEPOSITORY and gained command into the first turn, battled with that one to the five sixteenths, stayed on willingly to mid stretch then faded. IRISH
MEADOW , off the pace two wide, was under a ride between runners mid way on the final turn but lacked a bid. GIGGING lacked speed, raced three deep
leaving the three eighths, shifted wider for the drive but failed to rally. DEPOSITORY had speed to briefly lead, vied two wide outside BENANDJOE from the
seven eighths to the five sixteenths, was under a drive into lane and gave way. ENGLISH TAVERN , well back early, raced a bit erratically and failed to
muster up a run.

MATTITUDE sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out a bit turning for home and drew off under steady urging. COMBAT QUEEN
raced in the two path around the turn while chasing the winner, remained on her left lead in the drive and weakened. STIR CRAZY lacked speed, eased out
to the four path leaving the turn and failed to menace. MY MY GIRL , never a factor, circled the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home. KILLY START
saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail entering the stretch and gave way. KNOT ANYMORE , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, faltered
in upepr stretch.

Footnotes
SUMMER ODDS , patiently rated within range and off the inside, moved up between rivals leaving the five sixteenths, shifted in with aim on the leader
entering the lane, moved to command inside of TRITONE GIRL nearing the furlong grounds, kicked clear under a few left handed asks then proved clearly
best while appearing to have something left at the line. WHO KNOWS WHAT broke a step slow, edged up soon after to be in the fray, rated back a bit and
had to await some room mid turn, swung out for the drive and closed willingly to nab the place. TRITONE GAL , bumped at the break, attended the pace
outside TIZ SUSAN ANN, took control leaving the far turn then cleared, drifted three wide into the stretch, straightened and was hooked by the winner
leaving the three sixteenths, ceded command a furlong out then gave way grudgingly. TIZ SUSAN ANN bore out at the break and bumped a rival, corrected
and was sent up between foes to take command, took pressure then ceded the lead leaving the far turn, chased into the stretch and gave way near the
eighth pole. FORTES , three wide nearing the turn, lacked a rally. RISK MODEL stumbled soon after the break, regrouped and moved up to stalk four wide,
chased outside a rival mid turn then faltered.
