Footnotes
GOLD BEAR set all the pace from the two path then fought off the challenge from VALENTINE GUY and was able to draw clear late. VALENTINE GUY
pressed the pace while racing three wide and couldn't match strides with GOLD BEAR in the stretch drive but held the place. THE INFLUENCER was
unhurried early then started to move going into the final turn from the three path but flattened out in the stretch. BATTLESHIP BEVO tracked the leaders
from the inside then slipped through on the rail at the head of the stretch but faltered. BEST YEAR YET was allowed to settle in the two path but was not a
threat. STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF GOLD BEAR IN THE STRETCH, AFTER REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. RACE
WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MAMANEEDSNEWSHOES had an awkward start and bumped rival out of the gate, steadily advanced through the turn from the four path to gain the lead at
the sixteenth pole to prevail. KNIGHT AT THE ROXY dueled from the inside with HELLO HEARTBREAKER around the turn but didn't have enough to hold
off the winner but was able to hold on to the place. OUTCASHED tracked the leaders from the inside made a rail bid in the stretch but faltered. LA' HOPPER
raced in the middle of the pack from the three path then made a four wide bid on the turn to race evenly late. BOSTON SLICK was unhurried early then
made a move on the rail to improve position late. GRANITO DE ORO raced near the back and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. FORTYSLEW broke well
then was placed just off the pace to make a mild bid on the turn and weakened. HELLO HEARTBREAKER was rushed to contention and dueled from the
two path on the turn but tired going into the stretch. FIVE FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME IS NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
GOSPEL BUZZ set all the pace from the inside then was challenged at the half pole and inched clear to hold sway late. BULL RING saved ground on the
inside just off the pace then angled out in the stretch bid and just missed. IDENTIFY pressed the pace while racing two wide and weakened in the drive.
MIDNIGHT RIVER was allowed to settle from the three path then made a mild bid on the backstretch and flattened out. GOSPEL BANKER raced in the
middle of the pack while racing two wide but was never a factor. SILVER STAR OKIE trailed.

Footnotes
CLIMB AND MAINTAIN pressed the pace from the two path then gained the lead at the four furlong pole but was kept to task. DURITZ was unhurried early,
started to gain on leaders on the turn to make a late rally but was too late. GONNA GETCHA was just off the pace on the inside then made a rebid in early
stretch to regain and hold the show. SECRET PICASSO tracked the leaders from the three path made a mild bid going into the stretch but was one paced in
the drive. GENTLE GEORGE was away alertly to set the early pace then pressed the pace from the two path and tired in the final furlong.
PERFECTOMUNDO vied for the lead while racing three wide and faded. SPECIAL FORTUNE was never a threat.
