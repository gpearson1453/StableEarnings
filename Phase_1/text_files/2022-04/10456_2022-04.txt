Footnotes
HURRICANE DEBBIE pressed two wide, bid entering the lane, led in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure through the furlong. SKI SLOPE
broke a step slowly, rushed forward to set the pace leaving the chute, showed the way from an outer pressing HURRICANE DEBBIE, but got headed by that
foe in upper stretch, and was second best. DOUBLE OVERTIME tracked the top pair in the two path, and failed to threaten the top pair while proving the
best of the rest. RECIO'S BAYTOWN raced far back two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, and moved up. ROSA DE RUBY broke a step slowly,
failed to keep pace with the leading group early on, then stayed on to surpass tiring rivals in the final furlong. BECKY THATCHER came out a bit slowly,
took the turn three wide while off of the pace, then made little impact while hanging on her left lead. BAYTOWN MELODY laid off of the pace along the
inside, but tired.

Footnotes
A LITTLE FLYER settled off of the pace along the inside, gained in the three path around the far turn to bid three wide entering the lane, and drove clear on
her left lead. SARIAH SARIAH set the pace inside of a pair of rivals while a bit off of the rail around the first turn, allowed an outer ANCIENT BROWN to
dictate terms down the backstretch, reengaged that foe into the far turn, bid around that bend, led entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in
upper stretch, and was second best. ANCIENT BROWN pressed the leading pair from the outside and in the four path around the first turn, moved
decisively to reach the front at the six furlong pole, showed the way while tucking down into the far turn, met SARIAH SARIAH's rebid around the far turn,
got headed entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. KIMBERLEY DREAM tracked in the two path early on, then chased under urging around the
far turn while tipping to the three path, then stayed on mildly for a minor share. POSITIVE VIBES trailed, swung six wide entering the lane, and moved up.
MATT'S HONEY laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. MY WYNTER ROSE tracked in the three path early on,
but failed to keep pace before saving ground around the far turn, and made little impact. TALK RADIO prompted the pace two wide from between horses
while in the three path early on, chased those rivals down the backstretch, but faded through the final furlong. CARRY ON broke slowly while bumping the
inside part of the starting gate, and got outrun.

Footnotes
WINDY CITY RED stalked three wide, bid in upper stretch, vied while shifting ground a bit inwardly and brushing a rival in upper stretch, hung on his left
lead while gaining a narrow advantage leaving the furlong grounds, changed over in the final sixteenth as an outer YES SIR ROBERT menaced, and kept
that foe at bay. YES SIR ROBERT tracked in the two path, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the lane, rallied to take aim in the final furlong, bid
outside of a leading WINDY CITY RED entering the final sixteenth, but hung. FEAST set the pace inside of a vying rival, the inside of a pair of foes in upper
stretch while clinging to an advantage, got headed leaving the furlong grounds, and yielded in the final sixteenth. Z U AT THE RACES laid off of the pace
along the inside, steadily shifting out to the five path approaching midstretch, and moved up while hanging on his left lead. ALFIE SOLOMONS vied for the
lead two wide, then from between horses in upper stretch as the eventual winner produced a bid, took a brush from that foe approaching midstretch, and
gave way at the furlong grounds. TEMPLET never got involved. SIR NUISANCE was outrun.

Footnotes
BABY YODA pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, vied in the four path entering the lane while outside of a pair of rivals, assumed
command under very confident handling in upper stretch, and drew off handily. BEVERLY PARK rushed inside of rivals after a bit of a flat-footed beginning
to set the pace, showed the way a bit off of the rail around the turn, which allowed CRIME SPREE to produce a rail bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied
between horses entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart in upper stretch, proved no match at the furlong grounds, then resisted
THIRSTY BETRAYAL's inside place bid through the late stages. THIRSTY BETRAYAL tracked two wide, was taken in hand in a bit of tight quarters
between horses into the turn, then rallied in the final furlong to bid for place inside of BEVERLY PARK, but was denied reaching that position. CRIME
SPREE trailed along the inside, moved into tight quarters entering the turn, slipped inside of the leaders to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the
lane, but tired in upper stretch, and gave way while hanging on his left lead. FAMILY MAN tracked in the four path around the turn, but tired through the
lane.

the stretch with a mild gain in the late stages. EXPENSIVE CUT raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run.

chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and faded in the stretch drive. WHATSTHECONNECTION was bumped at the start then slightly
