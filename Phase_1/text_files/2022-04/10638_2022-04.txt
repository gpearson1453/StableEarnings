MOON DOG raced on the inside along the first turn, chased the pace, was in the two path along the far turn, in the six path into the lane, rallied in the upper
stretch, drove past the leader near the eighth pole, was under a long drive and prevailed in the final stages. STRONG LIGHT was squeezed at the start and
raced back early on, was on the inside through the far turn, blocked in the upper stretch, rallied up the inside once clear, was under a long drive in the final
stages but did not have enough. BIG PAPER raced in the three path along the first turn and was back early on, raced in the four path along the far turn, was
in the seven path into the lane, rallied down the lane with a late gain and held show in the final stages. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was on the inside along the
first turn while unhurried early on, fanned into the seven path entering the lane, rallied down the lane and just missed show in the final stages.
WORKINFROMHOME stalked the pace early, made a three wide bid nearing the lane, was in the five path entering the lane, continued the bid down the
lane but weakened late in the drive. DOWN TO BIZZNESS raced in the four path along the first turn, pressed the pace, raced from between horses along
the far turn, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. LEVEE PROUD set the pace early, was on the inside into the lane and
faltered late in the stretch drive. TRICOLOUR was a tad slow at the start and never a threat. HOLD THE LINE was through after a half. BANDIMERE was in
tight and steadied into the first turn.

Footnotes
RICHIES GREAT GIRL broke awkwardly from the gate, chased the early pace, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane,
rallied down the lane, drove past the leaders and cleared the field in the final stages. BAY STORM bobbled outward at the start, stalked the early leader,
raced in the two path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but was no match for the winner while just up for place at
the wire. SPICY MARG set the pace early from the inside, was in the two path into the lane, drew clear down the lane but yielded late and lost place at the
wire. STERLING MISS raced back early on, was in the six path into the lane with a mild gain in the stretch run. MAMBA WAMBA (IRE) was unhurried early
on, swung into the six path entering the lane, raced widest down the lane with a belated gain. MUSED (GB) was in the six path into the lane and moved up
in the stretch drive. BLISSFUL CHANGE chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch. LEMOS CUNHA was
never a threat. INAJIFFY was never a factor. SOUTHERN MAMA was put in tight and checked hard near the eighth pole. HABOBANERO broke awkwardly
and was never involved. COMPETENT had early speed then folded up.
