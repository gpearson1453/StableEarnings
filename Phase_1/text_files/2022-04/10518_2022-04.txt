COMPLETE AGENDA stumbled at the start breaking on top despite it, raced four then three wide into the first turn before settling briefly just off the inside
midway, tipped four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path near the half mile pole before tipping three wide at the three-eighths
placed to coaxing, went four wide through the latter portion of the turn and then four to five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining
outside, came inwards a sixteenth out to look AMERICAN LAW in the eye and seized command just inside that station, then inched away to the finish.
AMERICAN LAW broke out at the start bumping CHEEKY TICO, came under hustling to establish the front and show the way in hand along the inside,
remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and straightened away towards the rail,
dug in under growing threat to the outside, got collared just inside the eighth pole and ran on safe for the place honors. PREDICTED three wide through the
first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home, offered up a bid to latch on the leader to the outside
loosely between foes a furlong out, then flattened out in the late stages. CHEEKY TICO got bumped at the start by AMERICAN LAW, who broke outwards,
came under coaxing and chased forwardly placed just off the inside, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late going. NOBODYRIDESFORFREE chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. ZUZUDINI chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
CLOSING DEALS went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside under urging on the turn, dueled gamely on the inside of the
runner-up in the stretch and prevailed under strong urging. ROOSKI pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, was roused for
more outside the quarter-pole, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while well clear for the place. AMORE FIRE was taken in hand early
then positioned just off the pace, made a bid between foes around the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch
and weakened but was well clear for the show. CLASSIC VINMAN was ridden along at the rear of the field, went around the turn in the two path, drifted out
outside the sixteenth-pole and was no factor. LANFRANKOPHILE was urged along on the outside, jostled with a foe around the three-quarter pole, dropped
back five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. TWEAQUED broke out then tracked the early pace, jostled with a foe in the
vicinity of the three-quarter pole, chased the leaders past the half-mile pole then in the four path around the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
BUSTIN SHOUT moved in while showing speed then pressed the pace on the outside, traveled around the turn in the three path, was asked for more in
upper stretch, grabbed a short lead into the final furlong, fought with the runner-up to near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging.
SWASHBUCKLE moved in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure, vied inside on the turn, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the
lead to the winner around the furlong marker, battled with that foe to near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished but just held the place. PANSTER settled
on the outside early, was carried further out around the five-eighths, tucked in late on the backstretch, was guided around the turn in the three path, came
four wide into the stretch, chased the top two while remaining on his inside lead in the drive, drifted out in the final sixteenth and just missed the place.
VALMONT settled just off the pace, was shuffled back some behind NEW YORK'S FINEST around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn,
moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. MISSION
WRAPITUP was last to commence, moved out with five furlongs to run, advanced to race just off the pace around the nine-sixteenths, rounded the turn in
the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and capitulated. NEW YORK'S FINEST leaned out a bit at the start, moved in while showing speed between
horses, dropped off the pace at the nine-sixteenths, saved ground around the turn and had nothing left.

coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. ROZ five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly for the show honors. SWEET SUGAR BABY chased two to three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled three to four
wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. TONIGHT WE LOVE chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out,
angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. REELEY PSYCHED chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled

Footnotes
MR PHIL coaxed from the gate, knocked heads early on with JAXON TRAVELER to his outside before establishing sole command while in hand along the
inside, came under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was headed for command near
the eighth pole, dug in fighting on to take command back a sixteenth from home and prevailed gamely on the wire. JAXON TRAVELER dueled early on two
to three wide with MR PHIL to his inside, chased in closest aim through the turn coming under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, spun three then two wide
into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong from home, dug in and had the rider switch his crop to the left hand and shied out slightly getting
headed for the front a sixteenth from home, battled on to the finish clear of the rest for the place honors. SAGAMORE MISCHIEF broke in at the start
bumping COST BASIS, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
honors. OUR LAST BUCK got bumped repeatedly after the start by BIG ENGINE coming inwards and tucked to the rail to chase along the inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. COST BASIS bumped at the start by SAGAMORE
MISCHIEF, who broke inwards, came under brief hustling and chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home
and weakened. BIG ENGINE coaxed from the gate, came inwards bumping OUR LAST BUCK repeatedly before following him to the inside to chase in the
two path, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
IMMORTALIZATION stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, gained to take the advantage into upper stretch then kicked
clear and drew off under strong urging to prove much the best. NINTH OF APRIL settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch,
came between foes around the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. MR. J. MCKAY settled comfortably off the pace, was roused in the two
path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. FAZARO settled on the outside, was roused three
wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. EVERESTING was hustled from the gate, settled on the outside, went three then four
wide on the turn, was carried six wide into the stretch and came up empty. KOBE'S LEGACY bumped with a foe just after the start while off a step slow,
settled towards the back, went two to three wide around the turn and failed to threaten. PIPITO pressed the pace down the backstretch, vied in the two path
through the turn and tired. NECROMANCER bumped with a foe just after the start while off a bit slow then checked before clipped heels shortly thereafter
and bobbling, spotted the front many lengths, rounded the turn in the two path, swung six wide into the stretch then moved further out and was no factor.
KENTUCKY KNIGHT dropped back under urging, saved ground through the turn and failed to respond. BECKENBAUER was sent hard from the start, set
the pace under pressure to the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and faded.
