Footnotes
BODACIOUS CARTERS Broke slightly outwards and dueled in between, veered out a few paths mid-stretch, re-engaged and rallied once more, prevailed in
final strides. LETHAL STORM Away well, dueled inside well away from others, caught in final strides. JESS SPECIAL RAY Brushed between at start, drifted
outwards after first jumps towards outside rival, at mid-stretch shied away from a drifting rival inside and into the path of Gotta Bad Habit, third best beyond
that point. GOTTA BAD HABIT In contention until impeded badly by rival coming over into path from the inside, took up very sharply, and never had enough
from there. ROCK STAR DASH Away well but was outpaced badly early on, never close. A stewards inquiry was held against the #3 Jess Special Ray in
regards to potentially interference against #5 Gotta Bad Habit. After review, it was determined that #3 Jess Special Ray affected the performance of #5
Gotta Bad Habit enough to warrant a disqualification. #3 Jess Special Ray was therefore placed fourth behind #5 Gotta Bad Habit.

Footnotes
O G GULFSTREAM GUS Early speed to hold lead in two path into first turn, carried wider onto course heading into backside and was forced to make up
ground, moved up approaching half mile pole in three wide to challenge lead, drifted heading into the stretch way out into the six path, struck the front end at
sixteenth pole and held off oncoming rival. WHISPERING FLAME Showed very little early speed and had no run early, was out of touch with the field up
until the quarter pole where he commenced a bold rally outside of runners, forced eight wide into stretch, made excellent headway in stretch but ran out of
real estate. K P KRYPTON Allowed other rivals to head to lead and went to rail for first turn, quickly moved through inside along rail to challenge for lead,
dueled hard along backside inside of rival, continued to lead on turn and through the stretch before being overtaken at sixteenth pole, good enough to be
third best. PIRATE MISCHIEF Sent to establish position along rail in first flight, drifted slightly into the first turn which allowed rival to come challenge inside
of him, dueled from there on out outside from half mile all the way to eighth pole at top of stretch, fought on bravely until sixteenth pole where he ultimately
packed it in. SCRATCH ME Hustled hard to challenge for the lead, hung up three wide into the first turn, forced to take back heading into the backstretch
where he tracked on the rail behind leaders, lost ground backside as top two went clear of field, switched back to three path for stretch, unable to muster a
challenge in closing stages.

ORATORY GLORY Taken ahold of at break, sat third flight into the first turn four wide, made a sweeping move from the nine sixteenths pole to the half mile
pole to challenge for the lead, dueled outside of two other rivals from that point to the quarter pole, went on with it to the three sixteenths and took clear
command from there, drifted to the six path for the lane, started drawing away down the lane, evenly to victory. GOLDEN GODDESS Set up to press off
leader early on, moved up to engage the leaders at half mile pole, dueled in between too rivals, discarded of one challenger but was passed on outside by
eventual winner, taken out to seven path for the stretch drive, could not match winner. FLYCATCHER Stalked in second flight in behind the leaders,
watched a trio of opponents duel on lead midway through, moved up wide on the turn but top two had already gone well clear, ran evenly to the wire.
WINDI'S MOMENT Tracked behind first quartet, prompted to move up approaching the quarter pole, passed one tiring runner down the lane but failed to
factor in every other sense. CONQUEST MOONMAD Sent hard to the lead and cleared into the first turn, opened up a healthy lead into the backside, joined
just after the half mile pole and was forced to duel inside of two runners, backed out of battle just inside of the quarter pole and faded from there on out.
BUCKS LUCKSTER Broke a touch slow, dropped very far back early on, failed to do much. A riders objection was lodged from the jockey of #6 Golden
Goddess against the #2 Oratory Glory. The claim of foul was dismissed by the stewards.

L BAR D CLASSIC TRIP Broke extremely quick, set out for the lead, challenged inside and dueled outside of rival, made a narrow lead heading into the
stretch and shed early challenger but was joined to the outside by closing rival, held on to the wire. MINISTERSDON'TLIE Set up shop last but well within
touch of field, circled four wide into the turn through a sweeping move that saw him contending heading into the stretch, came home on wrong lead through
the length of the stretch, trying to wear down eventual winner, but couldn't get up. UP THE SCORE Broke well, chased inside and joined outside rival to duel
for lead, battled along inside at the rail through the lane, faded in closing stages. HEZA EAGLE Stalked just behind leading duo, called upon approaching
three sixteenths pole but failed to respond, drifted out to five path into the lane and ran evenly to wire. TIZ A SPEED BOMB Broke a touch slow and was
driven along to try and challenge but was in back-half of field, driven along around turn but never gave much.

Footnotes
BLUE GESSAMI Set up in stalking position and taken out to six path on first turn, stalked a healthy distance off the battling trio on the lead towards the
center of the track, rolled up to challenge inside of quarter pole and was within striking distance at eighth pole, had to check up on the heels of rival shifting
out into path and ended up in eight path of course, finished with a head of steam between runners to emerge victorious in final few jumps. TIGER BY HIS
TAIL Allowed to gather stride and worked into tracking position well off of lead, began to pick up around the five sixteenths marker and circled wide for the
turn, carried wide by drifting rivals inside and ended up on outer rail, fought along gamely outside of a quartet, late surge was not in time. FIGHT ME Dueled
from the outset into the first turn, was carried a few paths by inside rival, dueled along backside and took a narrow advantage approaching the quarter pole
into the far turn, fought along on turn, carried a handful of paths as inside rival drifted and initiated contact, fought along in between a line of four down the
lane but could not come up with victory. IZE A CRAFTY GAL Went to lead from the break, drifted towards the three path into the first turn, engaged with
outside rival and dueled at a quick tempo up the backstretch along the rail, urged to keep pace at three sixteenths pole, heading into the turn drifted out four
paths and carried four rivals with her, leg weary into the final sixteenth and faded. SWITCH BACK Tracked third flight in early stages, commenced rally at
quarter pole and swept up on the outside of four inside rivals, ended up in the nine or ten path as the field entered the stretch, couldn't keep up with other
runners as they came down the stretch and ran evenly to the line. LITIGATOR Dropped back early and ran in five path heading into the first turn, lost touch
with other runners as they made their way down the backstretch, asked with very little response as they rounded the turn, never a real factor. EMPEROR'S
CHOICE No early speed and was well detached early, made a very small move along the backstretch but failed to gain any traction. A stewards inquiry was
held in regards to the #5 Ize a Crafty Gal for drifting heading into the stretch. No change was made given all affected horses finished in front of horse in
question.
