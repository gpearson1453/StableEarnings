Footnotes
SPEAKING SCOUT stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane while drifting out, was bumped and edged
clear in the final stages. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, rallied down the lane and was rolling for place
in the final stages. ICARUS raced from between horses along the first turn while well placed early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied down the
lane but missed place in the final stages. DURANTE set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane while drifting
out and yielded late in the drive. VERSTAPPEN tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch run. SPIN
WHEEL was a tad slow at the start, raced in the three path along the first turn, was in the six path into the lane with a late rally in the stretch drive.
GUNTOWN raced back early on, was in the two path into the lane and lacked a late bid. ROCKET ONE was never a threat. LUCKY BOSS was never a
factor. MONOLOGUE raced three wide along the first turn, chased the early pace, was in the six path into the lane and faded late in the stretch. NAVAL
AVIATOR showed little. HAIL TO THEE was a bit slow at the start and rank early on.
