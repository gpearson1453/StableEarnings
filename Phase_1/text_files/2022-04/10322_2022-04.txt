Footnotes
COASTAL JAZZ sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and drew off as a handy winner. MR. STANG was reserved just off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. ORCADIAN STORM chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and gradually gave way. REDACTION lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. AUDACE was void of
early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not threaten.

THE BLACK STRAT sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch and held sway to the wire. TERRACOTTA SOLDIER settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished well to be clearly second best. JU JU GUY was
forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. GODGUNSNCOUNTRY raced closest to the winner throughout while
racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. OCULUS was fractious in the gate and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BOLD VOYAGER sprinted clear soon after the start, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased his advantage into the lane and was ridden out to
be kept to task. CLUB MESQUITE lacked early foot, raced between foes through the second turn while racing four-wide and finished with good late energy.
SPEEDING STYLE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, drifted inward nearing the sixteenth pole and finished
willingly when clear. FAST GALLITO was checked soon after the start, raced just off the leaders from the inside, checked again nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished with good courage when clear. GONE SOMEWHERE was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and gradually
weakened. OCTAVIUS PRIME chased the leaders from the inside for five furlongs and weakened. K P SILVER BULLET was bumped at the start, lagged
early, moved five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RIDER OF FAST GALLITO LODGED OBJECTIONS AGAINST BOLD
VOYAGER AND SPEEDING STYLE, THE OBJECTION AGAINST BOLD VOYAGER WAS CONCERING THE CHECKING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE MILE
MARKER AND THE OBJECTION AGAINST SPEEDING STYLE WAS AT THE SIXTEENTH POLE WERE HE CHECKED HIS MOUNT AS WELL. AND
AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PERFECT COME BACK raced unhurried early while racing from between foes, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the foe with a sixteenth
to run and drew off as a handy winner. HOUSE LIMIT sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, was no match for the
winner in the drive but clearly second best. TOP OF THE GAME showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady
bid. NO SUPAH FOR YOU was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed closing response. CLUB CHAMP
raced four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. SECOND BOLD was void of
early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. SPIRIT MISSION raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the
second turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BACK TO BUSINESS was away in good order to duel for the lead with BACK TO BUSINESS while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival into the lane,
quickly opened a clear lead and drew off with complete authority. SCARRAZANO disputed the pace with the winner from the inside, was no match for that
foe in the drive but finished well to hold the place. STOLEN HALO settled off the leaders early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and finished with good
late energy. EASY DOES IT was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. TOP REFERENCES raced off the
pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished evenly. GYPSY WOMAN chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after
going a half. LIP'S OF WINE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and failed to threaten. MISYA
GIRL raced off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. PLUM ROSE raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and
gradually weakened. SKY HIGH VERONIKA showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. VEGAS BEAUTY showed brief
speed, weakened and was eased.

Footnotes
CHEST CANDY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, reached the fore into the lane and edged away in the
drive. STITZY was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally. NOLONGERAHOBBY settled off the
leaders early, checked nearing the quarter, moved between foes in mid-stretch and finished willingly. RAIL HUGGER showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and finished with good energy. JACKS OUTLAW was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn,
reached a contending position but failed to sustain his rally. COURAGEOUS lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor. THEGLORYISALLMINE broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside and weakened after going six furlongs. TIZONA was void of early foot,
raced five-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. FIRST CALL was away alertly to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after
going six furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
