allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up four wide through the lane and closed well late. ROSIE OKIE was slow early on, raced near the inside at the
quarter pole, moved up four to three wide in the drive and made a good late rally. LADY SIERRA stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths
pole and weakened a bit in the final stages. SOUL SET FREE showed good early speed from the outside to set the pace and gave way in the drive. THE
CAT CAME BACK raced far back and never threatened.

moved up five wide near the quarter pole and made a late gain. OLD SOT was slow early on, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and moved up in
the drive. VIM AND VIGOR settled to the middle of the pack early, raced along the inside through the far turn into the lane and had no final winning bid.

Footnotes
INFINITE MORO was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide around the far turn and finished well to be clear under steady pressure. RUSH THE
COLORS dueled for the early lead while racing two wide, was well clear at the eighth pole and was empty late to finish second best. MORO LEGEND was
slow early, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, angled to the inside through the stretch and moved up along the rail. FINAL NARRATIVE was away
alertly, stalked the pace, raced three wide and had no final winning bid. COLEMAN CREEK dueled for the lead from the inside and gave way. KITTY CAT
BLING settled off the early going and failed to respond. CRAZY RIDGE stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and tired.
FORREST failed to sustain a bid. DUDA MATT was off slowly, raced six to seven wide through the upper stretch and raced far back.
