MAN DOWN never far back, surged to the lead four wide after a half, set the balance of the pace, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and won in hand.
IMTHEPRINCE unhurried early, swung wide and rallied determinedly to finish clear for second also in mid track. GALTERO close up inside, shifted out to
the six path entering the stretch then went evenly. SWINGIN FRIAR dueled for the lead two wide through the far turn then faded in the lane. NO
TOLERANCE with the second flight two wide, offered a mild bid three wide after a half then came up empty. TRACKING GOLD broke in front, set the pace
around the first turn, battled into the stretch then was used up. LAS ANA was no factor. GRITO DE PABLITO trailed.

Footnotes
GONNABEGOOD pressed the pace along the inside for a half, made the lead, quickly opened a daylight advantage and lasted under strong handling.
QUEEN CREED stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in determinedly in the six path late and was steadily gaining on the winner. RAINBOW SHIP away
alertly, set a pressured pace two wide to the top of the stretch then weakened late. HAPPY AS YOU GO swung wide and had a mild rally late. HAMPTON
DANCER well placed, failed to respond. SPEAK LIGHTLY vied for the early lead three wide and was through after a half. CAUSE OF LOVE was antsy in
the gate, hopped at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
CHOCOLATE RABBIT broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch under confident handling to win as much the best. LONE BOY
was unruly in the post parade, settled with the second flight four wide, rallied through the stretch two wide and got up for second. RUNAWAY RUSSELL
pressured the winner along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. GOING PRIMETIME never far back, finished with good courage in the six path.
MARCH MAGIC well placed, went evenly. DANES HEART saved ground and improved position through the stretch. EDGE OF DESTINY also fractious in
the post parade, passed tiring rivals. REACHING FOR GOLD was no factor. THORMEISTER had brief speed. BILLY BEACOUP close up early in the four
path, faltered in the stretch. ZAROSHA was outrun. KISS THE DEMON was never close.
