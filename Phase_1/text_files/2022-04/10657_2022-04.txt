Footnotes
CUZ, forwardly placed outside rivals racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside TIZ TRIUMPHANT racing through the far turn, took over entering
upper stretch and went clear under left handed pressure. The latter was urged inside rivals dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch,
dueled for command through the far turn, proved no match in the drive but kept on to save the place honors. CASTLE KING, caught four wide racing into the
first turn, tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight on the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position three wide nearing upper stretch but was
outkicked for second. MISTA DONZELLA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved ground throughout and continued with an even effort.
YOU'RE IN COREY, pulling against restraint, was held up dropping off the leaders racing into the backstretch, continued under rating between foes to the
far turn and faded into upper stretch. PHARAOH'S PROPHECY broke in the air while getting away slowly and soon trailed.

Footnotes
SPARKLING PLENTY was rated between foes tracking just off the leaders on the backstretch, shifted four wide on the bend, advanced to challenge for
command in that path nearing the furlong marker, then wrested the advantage to go clear under right handed pressure. YEGUITA QUEEN was settled out
of close quarters to track off the second flight on the backstretch, split foes nearing upper stretch, angled inside the leaders nearing the furlong marker and
edged a rival for the place honors in the closing stages. LUSCIOUS shifted inwards at the start bumping JULIE'S GRACE, was urged to dispute the pace
while angling to the inside on the backstretch, contested the issue through the turn to midstretch while shifting a bit off the rail but weakened late. QUEEN'S
BEST, shuffled back avoiding tight quarters at the start, settled outside a rival in early stages, shifted out five wide in upper stretch and continued to improve
her position. JULIE'S GRACE, bumped at the start, tracked off the second flight outside rivals, raced four wide through the turn and faded into the stretch.
NY BETH GETSITDONE angled inwards to force the pace outside a rival from the outset, dueled for command to midstretch and gave out in late stages.
MUTANNAAHY tracked off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter but retreated early. EMPEROR'S SONG, standing awkwardly in the gate at
the start, was off slowly and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
STRONG EAGLE broke sharply, forced the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, shook clear after a half, set the pace a bit off the rail into the
second bend, then held sway through the stretch under some right handed pressure. MAPACHE G tracked the leaders inside a rival as part of the second
flight, gained on the pacesetter on the far turn, briefly awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, tipped outside that foe while being roused to challenge but
proved only second best. EXACTING broke slowly losing position to the leaders, was settled along the inside, saved ground throughout but continued with
interest to improve his position. COMMANDER BIZ, urged along the inside disputing the pace in the opening stages, conceded the lead while switching
outside the eventual winner midway through the backstretch, continued in pursuit to the second bend and faded in the drive. MEAN JOE BRO tracked the
leaders outside foes in second flight, made brief progress three wide racing to the far turn, then shifted inwards while emptying out in the drive. JUPITER
RAIN was settled last to the backstretch and proved no threat. MOON SECRET tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the first turn, angled inside
nearing the backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
SNAKERATTLEANDROLL took up a position behind the second flight racing four wide on the backstretch, was prompted to commence a steady advance
three wide entering the turn, took over in that path in upper stretch and went clear late under firm encouragement. TWO STEP DANCE swerved out at the
start bumping WANNA WOW YOU while forcing that rival into the path of LITTLE BUD, was righted to track the leaders between foes, shifted out four wide
nearing the lane steadily gaining position into the lane but proved only second best. STONE AGE tracked off the second flight along the inside in the
opening stages, switched outside foes entering upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. BYRON'S GOLD settled well off the leaders racing
through the backstretch, angled out five wide racing through the stretch and made some belated progress. SIDNEY'S BID, urged along the inside prompting
the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. GOT FLOFFY broke sharply, set the pace in the three path racing into the
turn, couldn't match the winner nearing midstretch and gave way. WANNA WOW YOU, bumped, then forced into LITTLE BUD at the start, never gained
contention. LIL CROWN tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing to the turn and gave way after a half. LITTLE BUD, bumped at the start,
dropped well back early, was pulled up on the turn, then was vanned off the course following the race.

Footnotes
BEACH BREEZE was urged to a clear advantage racing to the backstretch a bit off the rail, held sway on a comfortable margin to the far turn, turned back a
challenge from PEACHTREE ROAD racing past midstretch, then drifted out markedly in the last furlong but held LALOBA FEROZ to the end under
pressure. The latter was settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide entering the stretch, moved to terms with the
winner while being carried out by that rival in late and just failed to gain even terms. PEACHTREE ROAD tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second
flight in the opening half, advanced in the three path to challenge for command between foes in upper stretch, shifted inside the top pair midstretch and
flattened out late. BEASTIE GIRL ducked inwards at the start impeding FORTUNATA, continued with a ground saving trip to the far turn and emptied out in
the drive. THREE COINS tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn and offered no rally. MAYHAP angled to the inside early tracking
just off the pacesetter but faded after a half. FORTUNATA, forced in at the start, trailed throughout.

FREE TO FLY broke readily, angled inwards setting the pace on a narrow advantage just off the inside racing into the turn, turned back a challenge from
ORNERY ANGEL leaving midstretch and edged clear under right handed encouragement. ORNERY ANGEL tracked the pacesetter four deep in second
flight on the backstretch, angled inwards racing through the turn to bid for command in the three path in upper stretch but proved no match. BION MAGIC
angled to the inside in early stages racing behind the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest to gain position while being
outkicked for second. TEE UP raced between foes just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, was eased off the pace after the opening three sixteenths,
shifted out four wide racing into the lane and gained some position in an even effort. TEXAS REWARD angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter as part
of the second flight racing into the turn and faded into upper stretch. MAGICGIRL broke slowly and never gained contention. TIZ HERSELF ducked in at the
start losing position to the field and failed to menace thereafter. ATLANTIC PRINCESS broke through the gate prior to the start, made brief pursuit of the
pacesetter between foes racing to the turn and gave way after a half.

Footnotes
STRIKE THE TOP was rated just off the leaders near the inside racing to the first turn, tipped out racing through the backstretch, advanced on the leaders
three wide nearing upper stretch and wrested the advantage in time under firm right handed encouragement. THRU THE VINE tracked the pacesetter three
deep to the backstretch, shifted in to press the leader racing through the far turn, gained the advantage entering upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner late. CLASSY OF COURSE, forwardly placed between foes stalking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch, conceded some
position after a half, angled to the inside on the far turn while briefly awaiting racing room nearing upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. I SAY I
PLAY, caught four wide racing into the first turn, dropped out early. GLAD ROCK (GER) was urged to the lead racing to the first turn a bit off the rail to set
the pace for five furlongs, dueled for command into the far turn and emptied out between foes racing into upper stretch. THREEOHTWOCASSIE WAS
SCRATCHED AFTER THE POST PARADE ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TRACK VETERINARIAN.

Footnotes
BAHAMIAN MOON, prominent four wide between foes prompting the pace through the backstretch, shifted inwards while wresting a clear advantage racing
into the turn, held sway on a clear margin well off the rail into the stretch and remained clear despite the loss of her rider's whip. KITTY KITTY was rated out
of striking distance in early stages, made a steady gain to contention three wide between foes racing through the turn and proved best of the others.
LOVIELEE, forwardly placed five wide racing just off the leaders on the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the eventual winner four wide to upper stretch
and faded late. EAST WING settled into stride racing off the rail through the backstretch, shifted out five wide racing through the turn and continued with
interest to improve position. LADY NOY stalked off the first flight inside rivals in early stages, then continued evenly between foes into the lane. LITTLE RED
BUTTON angled inwards to press the pace between foes in the opening quarter and emptied out racing into the turn. SILVER TUNES flashed brief pace
inside foes but gave way nearing the turn. GREGS POSSE vied for the lead three wide between foes into the turn and gave way early. LADY
TEUFLESBERG bore out badly in early stages, raced on the outside rail through the turn to upper stretch but was righted in late stages to regain some
position while trailing throughout. FOLLOWING THE EIGHTH RACE, THE REMAINING CARD WAS CANCELLED DUE TO HEAVY LIGHTNING.
