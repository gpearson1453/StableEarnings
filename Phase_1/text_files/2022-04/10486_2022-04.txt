Footnotes
CHAPEL BARN took control soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, drew out through the lane under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. FIRERY
TALE last away, moved up into a striking position up the backstretch, closer outside the winner late in the turn, could make no further progress on that rival
to prove no match, clearly second best. CARL G came out a bit just after the start, broke with the lead pack, fell back off the issue up the backstretch,
dropped inside late in the turn, could do little with the top two in the drive, saved the show. DR. FORMAN floated out a bit after the start, closest to the
winner early from between horses, began to gradually weaken before a half. DIXIE STREET broke alertly, fell back soon after, saved ground in turning in an
effort. NEWS BOX fell back soon after the start to trail, four wide into the lane, lacked a rally. BROTHER AARON failed to make an impact while racing three
wide.

Footnotes
THE FEATURE broke on top, shrugged off a foe to be well clear early in the turn, maintained a comfortable advantage through the lane under a hand ride,
wrapped up late, ridden out. APPRAISAL in the second flight in the run up the backstretch, three wide and between rivals through the turn, not a serious
threat to the winner through the lane, clearly second best. FUNANDFUNNY forwardly placed early, also raced in the second group through the turn, no
match top two, narrowly gained the nod for the show. BITCOIN BANKER within striking distance, traffic into the turn, continued in a bit tight to steady soon
after, remained in traffic late in the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, some late interest to miss the show. ROAD BIBLE in the second flight outside, raced
four wide through the turn, lacked a significant closing response through the stretch. HARD TO PARK lacked early foot off the inside, three wide into the
lane, improved position slightly while also not a serious threat. AXIS lacked speed, four out to five wide turn, failed to muster a bid. MAJOR CHANCE off a
step slow, was never a factor. SMOKEYMOUNTAINRAIN unprepared for the start to begin slowly, moved up to race closest to the winner before a quarter,
gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MISTRESS asked early, forward and inside, moved out, floated three wide turning for home by the leader, engaged that one approaching the
furlong marker, wore that one down under steady handling. OUTLAW QUEEN broke out but alertly, cleared toward the inside, came in the two path for the
drive, briefly responded when the winner challenged a furlong out then could not keep up. FASHIONABLY QUICK lacked speed off the inside, angled out
sharply to be five wide turning into the lane, no match for the top two, clear of the others. BEACH BODY off a step slow, trailed for a half, displayed a
modest amount of late interest to improve position. CORTADO fell back just after the start then was asked for some run, saved ground through the turn,
continued one paced through the stretch. MUSE within striking distance, lacked response while well off the inside. CHAOS MAGIC bothered to be away
slowly, four wide into the turn, began to tire after a half.

Footnotes
PRESIDENTIAL closest to the leader while racing in the two path, ranged up to challenge in the far turn, put a head in front late in that bend, shook clear
upper stretch under while coming out slightly, kept the runner up safe under firm handling. BROOKLYN DIAMONDS off the pace while saving ground,
continued inside through the second bend, shifted out for room around the tiring leader nearing midstretch, finished willingly to be clear for the place.
HAPPY BOY ROCKET broke through the gate prior to the start, dwelt to spot the field about three lengths, continued to trail, moved out, four wide into the
lane, staged a mild rally to annex the show. ST ANDREWS broke well, showed the way into the first turn closest to the inside, continued to show the way
backstretch under light restraint, responded briefly when confronted by the winner in the second turn then began to weaken at the head of the lane.
NINETIES COUNTRY lacked speed while three wide through the first turn, continued one paced through the second turn, failed to respond when called on
for the drive. BLUE NORTHER forwardly placed while four wide into the first turn, remained within striking distance outside, gave way three wide far turn.

stretch under light restraint, kicked clear clear under a steady right handed then left handed crop while drifting a bid. AUX ARCS broke alertly to be almost
immediately clear, showed the way into the turn, responded when challenged by the winner, dueled into the stretch then could not keep up, narrowly lasted
for the place. CYBER MONDAY broke back, raced five wide through the entire turn, rallied while continuing well wide stretch, finished willingly to miss the
place. JUSTDENNIS last away, lacked speed, improved while saving some ground out of the turn, no threat to the top three. HIGHTAIL COWBOY forwardly
placed early, began to steadily weaken before a half. WARNING LABEL in mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked a closing response. MOONSHINE

Footnotes
FULL AUTHORITY broke on top, prompted the pace three wide up the backstretch, vied three wide and between horses through the turn, hooked up with
the winner for an extended stretch duel closest to the inside, outgamed that one under firm handling. SEVEN NATION ARMY off the early pace out in the
strip, made a four wide move to challenge midway on the turn, gained the advantage, long duel, led late, outkicked in the late going. BANK fell back to trail
after the start, second the leaders in the two path for most of the turn, steered out with less than a furlong remaining for room, rapidly getting to the top pair
late. ISOLATE lacked early foot while off the inside, four wide into the lane, floated out by BANK inside the furlong grounds, also was going well late to be
closing the gap on the top two. NO SHIRT NO SHOES vied up front off the inside, weakened from between rivals after a half. BASIC CHANCE narrowly set
the pace along the inside, also gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN GRAYCE forwardly placed from the start off the inside, challenged three wide and between horses turning for home, gained the advantage and
drove clear under brisk handling. CONNIE K back off the pace toward the inside, traffic into the turn under a snug hold, swung out to be five wide turning for
home, bit closer to the winner nearing the furlong marker then proved no match, clearly second best. I'M THE BOSS OF ME behind the leaders while inside,
continued to ride the rail through the turn, improved inside to be along for the show, not a threat to the top two. ALBERTA SUN void of speed off the inside,
three wide into the turn, tipped four wide exiting, improved a bit, not enough for the show. WELL SPENT broke out, raced off the pace and the inside, closer
four wide midway on the turn, flattened out in the drive. OSCARETTE broke on top, showed the way for four furlongs in the two path, gave way when
headed turning for home. HOTASAPISTOL balked at loading, last to leave, saved ground to no avail in trailing throughout.

Footnotes
ALL WEST took back under firm restraint early, steadied behind horses midway on the first turn, moved out, advanced into contention while four wide
midway on the second bend, engaged the leader soon after, wore that one down past the furlong marker, drew clear under encouragement. MAKE NOISE
cleared past the wire the first time, continued to show the way backstretch two path, shrugged off a pair of foes second turn, clear again, could not keep
pace with the winner down the stretch, proved stubborn for the place while drifting in a bit. ARRIVAL void of speed while in some traffic early in the first turn,
moved closer toward the inside second turn, flattened out to lose contact with the top two through the lane, lasted for the show. STRIKE A BEAT settled off
the pace and the inside, three to four wide second turn, lacked a closing kick, not enough for the show. EGOMANIAC three wide in the first turn in mid pack
first turn, moved inside and saved ground through the second bend, came up empty for the drive. AWESOME SATURDAY settled off the pace while four
wide into and through much of the first turn, moved closer after a half to pose a brief threat to the leader far turn, began to weaken with just over a quarter
mile remaining. LOCH GARMAN prompted the runner up from along the inside, lodged a bid up inside that one just before a half, pressed into the far turn
and gave way.

Footnotes
SUPREMACY took control soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, came out a bit in front of the runner up that one was called on for some run
turning for home, opened up daylight into the lane then had just enough to hold that same rival off in the waning strides to gain the nod. HUNKA BURNING
LOVE dropped in from the four path midway on the first turn to save some ground, prompted the winner up the backstretch, crept closer to that one in the
second turn, floated out a tad into the lane by the winner, fell back off that one then came back late to miss. SUPER CONSTITUTION settled off the pace
and the inside early, remained back into the far turn, asked along soon after, two path into the lane, slowly getting to the top two late. HOZIER in mid pack
well off the inside, came three to four wide through the second turn, widest in the drive, finished up evenly. ANTIGRAVITY last to leave after a light bump at
the break, trailed, passed tiring rivals while off the inside to improve a bit through the lane. BANDIT SWANSON void of speed, failed to menace while racing
toward the inside. PATS PROPERTY chased the winner for a half, gave way. BRICE off the pace, shortened stride before a half, pulled up, vanned off.

BEST ACTOR away in good order, set the early pace toward the inside, dueled in the run into the far turn closest to the inside, continued on even terms with
the runner up through that bend, headed turning for home, roused, battled back in determined fashion to edge away late. LIFE ON THE NILE broke on top,
moved out early in the first turn when behind the winner, engaged that one onto the backstretch, dueled outside that one into the final turn, put a head in
front entering the stretch, in turn headed by the winner past the furlong marker, could not match that one to the wire, held sway for the place. CHILENO in
the second flight while outside, advanced three wide to race closest to the dueling leaders into the lane, steadily getting to the runner up in the final strides
while too late. KUNSHAN BRIDGE lacked early foot off the inside, four wide first turn, remained outside, four wide again in the second turn, staged a mild
rally while not a serious threat. BATTLE CALL in traffic into the first turn, three wide throughout, turned in an even effort in lacking a closing response. EL
GEMAR steadied in traffic in the first turn when well off the pace, remained always back. VIGANO in the second flight early along the inside, had little for the
stretch run. FAST AND FEMININE main body inside early, began a steady fade before a half, four wide around tiring rivals in the final turn, remained always
back. BONNE CHERE last away, remained always back in showing little. SMOKEY STORY closest to the dueling leaders for a half, stopped far turn,
distanced through the stretch after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
JACKIE'S WARRIOR broke running, dueled on the outside under light restraint up the backstretch and into the turn, disposed of the other speed under his
own courage turning for home to open a sizable advantage, idled along inside the furlong marker, roused late to have enough late to hold off the next two.
LETSGETLUCKY in the second flight while racing in the three path, eased out a bit exiting the turn, set down between rivals past the furlong marker, coming
late with good courage to prove second best. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK in the second group outside the runner up, came four wide for the drive, also called
on for some run when straightened for home, came close to matching the runner up in the late going while also closing the gap on the victor. BOB'S EDGE
last away, void of speed while well off the inside, came in the five path for the drive, displayed some modest interest down the middle of the strip. EMPIRE
OF GOLD dueled up front inside the winner while under some encouragement up the backstretch, began to falter turning for home, continued to weaken the
final furlong. MOJO MAN broke with the field, lacked speed in the run up the backstretch toward the inside, moved out a bit for the run through the turn,
lacked any kind of punch through the lane.

Footnotes
OBVIOUSLY TOO broke in and a step slow, raced back early as a result, steady gain five wide through the turn, engaged the leader inside the furlong
grounds and edged clear under steady handling. LOU'S ARROW closest to the leader up the backstretch, moved out a bit for the turn, took over outside that
rival turning for home, clear past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, remained clear for the place. CYBERTOWN forwardly
placed off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, lacked a winning response down the lane, saved the show. SLIGHTLY CRAFTY in mid pack just off
the inside early, dropped inside for the turn, improved with a mild rally. BACKGATE RED restless in the gate, lacked early foot, came five wide into the lane,
also improved a bit without posing a serious threat. YOUNG O' DAINE broke sharp to be quickly clear, showed the way into and through the turn toward the
inside, weakened when headed by the runner up entering the stretch. JACKYS BACK void of speed, was never dangerous off the inside. MR. WULLY
BULLY off a step slow, raced back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BOTANY raced toward the front off the inside and in
traffic, steadied in tight quarters entering the turn, fell back and did not recover. MOONSHINE VISION broke back, raced five to six wide through the turn,
remained back in the run through the lane. CATS GOTTA CHANCE in mid pack early five wide into the turn, closer through the bend then stopped in the
drive.
