Footnotes
NAVAJA came in and bumped rival at the start, quickly recovered and held a slim margin throughout while under a confident hand ride. MORNINGS WITH
MARIA probably best, bumped both sides at the start, then bumped solidly on the hind end, turning her sideways briefly, when in the clear, leveled quickly
and drifted in two paths, finished well just to miss, galloped out well. VALIANTLI away cleanly and well, maintained a straight course while under urging and
outkicked by rival late. HYLEIGH MOTIVATED bumped multiple times at the start, when in the clear was green and failed to level. SECRET SUCCESS
away clean, but then outside rival came in and bumped her hard, knocking her off stride, after the rough beginning rider hand rode to the wire. PYC
SPECIAL DASH broke out, bumped hard with rival at the start, bouncing off and hitting the inside horse, which knocked her off stride and rider had to take
up, losing all chance.

length slow, recovered well and responded well to urging to rally and just miss. FIRST NAVA CARTEL came in two paths at the start, quickly into stride and

evenly, under a hand ride. ATTACKER off slow while breaking in early, intimidated and brushed by rival early on, rider rode cautiously as outside rival was
hard to control, shook the reins late and responded while galloping out with plenty of energy. JESS KNOCKOUT came in at the start, corrected, then lugged
in and brushed foe early, continued trying to get in, finally straightened out and drifted out late. J BEST STAR broke in and hit the gate, paused briefly early
when rival lugged in, and ran the rest of the way evenly under hand urging.

effort. J PERFECT DEAL lunged out two paths at the start, corrected and drifted in three paths, steady urged throughout and outkicked by two good rivals.
BRAVERY away cleanly, failed to get out of first gear under a hand ride in a one paced effort. FRAQ ATTACK off bit slow, green early when failing to
maintain a straight course, leveled out when asked, and finished with interest past the wire. KING STORM floated out three paths at the start, tried to
continued to drift out, so rider took a hold and finished under a hand ride. REMEMBER MY PRIZE very hard to load and unseated the rider, came away
slow while being bumped at the start, lugged in early and under a tight hold to the wire.
