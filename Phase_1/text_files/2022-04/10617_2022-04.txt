COOL RUNNINGS just off pace three wide, rolled past leader into the stretch to go well clear under steady rousing to the wire. HOW IT GOES dueled to
turn, between horses into stretch while no match for the winner. KICK ROCKS KID raced evenly off rail to the turn, kept on to garner third spot. FAST ROY
inside speed to the quarter pole, gave way, lost show late. NICE KAZ never menaced while losing ground throughout. CANDY CURL never prominent to the
turn from inside. PASSIONATE LUCK always trailed.

Footnotes
ISLE OF GRACE hustled along to the front, stayed game in the stretch and drew off as much the best today. CARIBBEAN NIGHT lagged back, rallied
between horses to turn and ran on for place spot while no match, clearly best of the rest. MERRY OF SOUL chased winner from off rail into the stretch,
could not keep up and faded through the final furlong. STORMY NILE raced evenly from off rail throughout with no late gain in the drive. REINA DE LA
ROSE brief speed inside but gave way readily in the stetch. BACKYARD HEN never menaced. TICKLISH broke sharp outside, never reached contention.
GRETEL broke terrible and never a menace. FEMINIQUE terrible start, never close.
