SUNLAND STAR Set up mid-division in four path early, swept up outside of rivals at three-sixteenths pole, challenged and took command at eight pole,
drew clear to victory. ORATORY GLORY Far back early, commenced rally at quarter pole inside of rivals, shifted to two path at sixteenth pole as runner
drifted to rail in front of him, finished well when space was found. SIR DEPUTY Sent hard and took clear lead at half-mile pole, led into the stretch, drifted to
rail under right handed urging at sixteenth pole and tired in final yards. ROLL OUT Taken back and tracked inside of horses, moved out wide into the seven
path for the stretch, showed mild late interest. I'M NOT GABBY Stalked in the three path two wide, asked to challenge quarter pole, advanced close to lead
at eighth pole, and was out finished through the stretch. WASSUP BRO Hustled to challenge for early lead but ultimately set up and stalked from the
half-mile pole, asked to run at three-sixteenths pole, no response. THIRTYMINUTEMASS Taken back early, trailed throughout, showed little. A stewards
inquiry was held into the stretch run involving the #2 Sir Deputy and #7 Oratory Glory, no change was made.

TAKE CHARGE DEPUTY Taken back early well off the leaders, moved from last at nine-sixteenths pole between rivals, showed steady gain along
backstretch to challenge leading duo at quarter pole, took narrow lead just inside the eighth pole and was ridden out confidently to a measured victory.
CAPTAIN RED Set up just off the leader early on and then engaged them at half-mile pole, fought on bravely between rivals from quarter pole to wire but
did not have enough. TIGER BY HIS TAIL Led along rail from the outset and was engaged to duel for lead at half-mile pole, battled from the quarter pole to
the wire and was held at bay. OUTLAW BY NATURE Stalked two wide in early stages but lost ground along backstretch, ran evenly along the turn and
failed to menace through the stretch. DEFENSE WINS Stalked early on rail, lost ground on leaders throughout backstretch, asked by rider at quarter pole to
advance and showed no gain. MONGOLIAN WINDOW Tracked in the third flight outside of rivals, dropped back steadily from the half-mile pole on, nothing
left for stretch. PREACHINATDINNER Tracked leaders along rail, showed little from nine-sixteenths pole on despite heavy urging from rider.
