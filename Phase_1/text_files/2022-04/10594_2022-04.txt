turn in the three path then dug in from the eighth pole to get up late yards. WILLIE THE WHALE chased and rounded the turn off the rail, eased out entering
the stretch and dug in, jumped, and was struck by a fallen competitor late stretch but got up for second. MAJESTIC SEAS pressured the pace and
contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. BE BE BOP was hustled to the lead at the seven
sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, gave up the advantage mid-stretch and flattened the final
sixteenth. WINDSOR'S CHAMPION gave chase and saved ground. BLACK CANDY chased inside, rounded the turn at the rail and weakened. FREEDOM
IS RINGING gave close early chase and rounded the turn in the three and four paths, dueled for the lead mid-stretch, fell late yards but got up and walked

Footnotes
SO RED THE ROSE rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and drew to even terms three wide midway on
the far turn, then dug in determinedly to turn back the game effort of TALKTHETALK, who became a bit edgy in the gate then rated close off the rail, bid
past the three eighths pole and took a slim brief lead between horses nearing the quarter pole, was met midway on the far turn and dug in gamely to late
stretch before ceding; reluctantly. DEVILISH BEAUTY broke awkwardly then saved ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far
turn and finished well. REIGNING FIRE settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, eased out into the backstretch and bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, angled to the five path toward the eighth pole and ran evenly in the lane. DINNER AT FIVE was hustled up toward the three quarter pole
and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail approaching the quarter pole and
weakened on the turn. MARY'S JEWEL rated just off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
AARON'S TAP settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took over in the three path midway on the far turn,
then dug in under determined stretch handling to eke out the advantage over ELLIE'S LIL MAN, who stalked off the rail then took the lead two deep while
between horses into the backstretch, came under pressure at the three eighths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn but dug in gamely to the
finish. FEISTY AND SASSY settled off the pace two deep the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
three path and came along for third mid-stretch. VIDMER'S COURAGE rounded the opening turn about the five path then stalked into the backstretch,
challenged toward the three eighths pole but dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. NAUTICAL WARRIOR rounded the first turn in the six
path, left the turn outside and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, ran through the far turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. HARD
BEING ME was bumped off stride at the break then saved early ground racing well back and showed little response through the backstretch. EISELE was
not a factor. BLACK STEEL broke inward to make sharp contacdt with Hard Being Me then set the early pace inside, was headed into the backstretch and
gave way.
