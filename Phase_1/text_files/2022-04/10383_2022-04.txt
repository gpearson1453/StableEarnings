WISH FOR PEACE was reserved early, advanced on the turn four wide, came five wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up in deep stretch
then edged away to prove best, driving. KAZTHAROS set the early pace in the four path, then was three wide on the turn and pressed by BUMBLE
MONSTER from the inside, then dueled with that rival by the furlong marker, dug in gamely and shook off that bid but could not hold off the winner late,
second best. BUMBLE MONSTER was rated along kindly early, made a inside move on the turn to press the pace and was roused by the quarter pole, then
made a bid to duel for command by the furlong marker but flattened out late. ROCKIN THE PALACE chased the early pace five wide, came six wide into the
drive and weakened. IM YOUR PAPI stalked the early pace four wide and stopped.

MINER'S GEM chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up late under a drive. HIPNOTIZADA showed
good speed up the inside to set the pace at the half mile peg, then drew out leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was caught late to just
miss. PERFECT HIDEAWAY chased the early pace and advanced on the inside on the turn, tipped out three wide for aim on the front runner but had no
punch in the drive. MAGGIE'S BID prompted the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and was empty. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD was settled
early and was three wide on the turn and had no rally.

POLISHED GEM set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear on the turn, then remained clear leaving the turn, then drifted out through the lane but
remained clear to prove best under a drive. JEANETTEO chased the early pace three wide, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole, then finished
willingly to gain the place award. BEACH BANKER pressed the pace three wide and kept on to the wire but lost the place late while saving the show award.
GOLDEN LAW was allowed to settle early while three wide, then was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the drive and offered a mild late rally on
the outside. FROSTED ANGEL was allowed to settle two wide early, then was three wide into the drive, shifted in by the furlong marker and had no kick.
DWELLER was well placed early on the inside and weakened.
