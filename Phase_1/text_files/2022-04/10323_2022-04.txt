SUPER STEAMY unhurried early, rallied along into far turn, coming on outside to be up in time. LIVE IT UP rushed to the front, led to deep stretch while all
out but nailed on the wire. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) settled never far back throughout but flattened out with no late gain in stretch. MAGNA G FORCE was antsy in
gate, inside run to far turn, split horses into the stretch run but flattened out in the final furlong. MISS NEKO raced evenly throughout with no late run when
needed. HERO OF THE BEST chased pace early, dueled to far turn but weakened in the drive. HAMPTON SPRING brief speed inside but gave way readily
at the half and dropped back. BOW MAKER was off tardy and never menaced thereafter.

NEVER KNOW CHRISTY broke sharp to the front, well handled to lead all poles and held sway to the wire. AUNT IRENE had a tardy start, rushed inside,
checked early on to turn, angled out for clear run but was not good enough in the final furlong. PETRICHOR never far back to the turn, made a sweeping
wide move into stretch for the show spot. MAMA LOU inside run through the stretch with no late gain in the drive. CLASSY LYNN flashed brief speed
outside but gave way quickly and dropped back.

Footnotes
TOP HAT BOSS squeezed at start, tracked leaders to turn, rallied, cleared off. KICK OUT THE JAMS bothered st, chased between to turn, lost whip stretch,
best of the rest. WAR TANGO never far back outside to stretch, rallied along for show spot. WARIS inside run while evenly with no response in the stretch
run. MISSY LIZZY bothered start, failed to menace thereafter. ISLE OF GRACE inside chase to turn, gave way steadily in the drive. KEEP SCROLLING
quick from gate outside, overtaken, shuffled back to turn, widest into stretch while veering in with no late gain. TROUBLE FINDS ME outside speed to front
but through at the half and dropped back. SHELLY'S BABY dropped far back with nothing left.
