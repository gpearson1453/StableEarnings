Footnotes
NEGLIGENCE was urged prompting a rival's pace through the backstretch, took over entering the turn, then edged clear through the stretch under
pressure. THEJIGISUP tracked just off the leaders three wide in early stages, was prompted to challenge the pacesetter racing through the turn but proved
no match while besting the others. TURNPIKE MIKE tracked off the first flight along the inside in early stages and continued evenly into the stretch.
BUSTER BURNS, reserved last early, never gained striking distance. TAPINTOYOURBEER settled outside foes on the backstretch and failed to menace
thereafter. RUNAWAY TOM briefly disputed the pace inside the eventual winner on the backstretch but gave way early.

Footnotes
ZIGGY broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow margin racing a bit off the rail to the turn, turned away a rival's challenge on the turn
and steadily widened racing through the stretch under a drive. NANTUCKETER was rated off the second flight outside a rival on the backstretch, tipped out
three wide nearing the lane and proved best of the others. STAYIN OR STRAYIN tracked just off the pacesetter outside a rival in early stages, was
prompted to lodge a brief bid entering the turn but soon flattened out. MIAMI CHROME angled to the inside while being urged to prompt the pacesetter and
faded after a half. RIP IT RYAN settled last on the backstretch and never menaced. TINKER'S PAL broke awkwardly while ducking in at the start, was urged
along the rail in pursuit of the leaders on the backstretch but emptied out early.

Footnotes
ZOOMED IN, in touch with a rival prompting the pace through the chute to the first turn, was eased off that foe to stalk that rival into the backstretch, readily
advanced to press the issue on the far turn, took over leaving midstretch and kicked away under firm encouragement. KAZACHAN was urged inside the
eventual winner disputing the pace in the opening stages, set the pace through the backstretch to the far turn, dueled inside the winner into upper stretch,
but proved no match late while narrowly prevailing for the place honors. BELLA CASCATA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, inside a rival
racing to the far turn, tipped off the inside entering the stretch and continued with interest between foes to finish on even terms with a rival for a share. LADY
CREATIVE tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight to the backstretch, then continued willingly in the three path into the stretch to finish on even
terms for a share. HIDDEN SPRINGS settled last racing to the far turn, split foes midway through that bend and continued with some interest to improve
position. NO MO DANCING settled outside rivals racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a serious challenge. IVY WAY was rated along the inside
behind the second flight in early stages but came up empty racing through the far turn. LUNA'S TREASURE tracked off the first flight between foes in early
stages and gave way racing into the far turn.

LYRICAL tracked the leaders from out of striking distance outside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, swung four wide entering the stretch, took over
leaving the furlong marker and shook clear under firm encouragement. U KNOW I B LION tipped just off the inside tracking the leaders leading the second
flight on a narrow advantage, advanced on the leaders racing into the stretch, split foes nearing the furlong marker to challenge for command but proved no
match for the winner. SMOOTH AS GLASS settled last outside foes on the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the stretch and was along for a share in
time. CELESTIAL ORB angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out four wide racing past midstretch
and was just outkicked for a share. FLASH TOWN contested the pace inside a rival in the opening stages, conceded the lead after the opening three
sixteenths, tipped outside the pacesetter racing into the turn turn, pressed the issue to gain the advantage nearing upper stretch but gave way once headed
approaching the furlong marker. NOTHINS FREE was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, edged forward nearing the turn, dueled
for command inside rivals on the bend to upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DREAM LINER (BRZ) was settled off the second flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing upper stretch, came out
entering the lane to bid four wide between foes bumping OUTRAGEOUS BET but continued with a solid late response to prevail between foes under firm
encouragement. OUTRAGEOUS BET switched off the inside tracking the leaders just behind the second flight to the backstretch, tipped out four wide
nearing the lane steadily advancing to contention, was bumped, then forced out by DREAM LINER (BRZ) nearing the furlong marker but kept on to contest
the issue to the end. OBIWAN tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn, angled to the inside nearing upper stretch to bid for
command inside the leaders, gained a brief advantage midstretch but was collared by the top pair late. BIRD'S EYE VIEW angled to the inside tracking the
leaders in second flight, saved ground throughout but lacked the needed final bid. FLY FLY AWAY was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset
to the far turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and abruptly gave out leaving the furlong marker. SANDY LANE KITTEN, in touch with the leaders between
foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled outside a rival while being carried out in upper stretch and quickly gave out. TREASURE
RUN, urged three wide to the backstretch prompting the pace, gave way nearing upper stretch. LORD BARNA broke awkwardly dislodging his rider from his
irons at the start and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF OUTRAGEOUS BET LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE
RIDER OF DREAM LINER (BRZ) ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY.
AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENT IN THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED DREAM LINER (BRZ) FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM
SECOND.

the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival on the turn to gain the advantage but proved no match when confronted by the winner. LINDSEY

leaders outside a rival racing to the turn but offered no rally. LADY IN HEELS was urged along the inside disputing the pace through the backstretch into the
turn and gave way into upper stretch. BRASS BAND flashed brief pace between foes but gave way early. SPEEDY ENOUGH settled outside foes in early

Footnotes
REMUDA broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage nearest the rail, edged clear racing into upper stretch and held ROCK THE STARS safe
to the end under pressure. The latter was rated between foes tracking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, angled inside nearing the lane and
continued with a steady bid to gain terms with the winner late. DELTA RIDGE was rated three deep between foes in second flight to the backstretch,
dropped back nearing the far turn, then shifted out five wide entering the lane to improve position late. BANDERO, in touch with the first flight racing four
wide through the first turn to the backstretch, continued in pursuit of the winner three wide to the lane and faded in the drive. MAPACHE G settled last along
the inside early, switched out racing through the far turn but lacked a rally. TAP THE CANDY vied briefly with the first flight three wide between foes and
faded early. WINTER'S GHOST, in touch with the first flight prompting the leader between foes to the far turn, gave way into the lane. MOON HUNTER
tracked off the first flight inside rivals to the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. DEVIL'S MYTH, caught wide early, failed to menace.

Footnotes
SOUPSTER angled inwards in the opening stages while moving to terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch into the turn,
pressed the issue into upper stretch and took over late while kept to firm encouragement. WINNING MANDATE, urged along the inside dictating the pace
on a narrow advantage to the turn, dueled grudgingly inside the winner past midstretch but yielded late. ADRIANA ES BONITA tracked just off the first flight
under rating racing to the turn, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no closing bid. ANAHIYA'S DREAM
settled between foes early, shifted to the four path racing into upper stretch and improved her position. FLOR DE PLATA tracked the leaders inside foes on
the backstretch, switched out to split foes entering the lane and continued evenly. SENA THE DUCHESS tracked the pace outside foes on the backstretch,
angled inside racing through the turn and faded in the drive. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA broke slowly, then was shuffled back at the start and failed to menace
thereafter. SPANISH EXCHANGE dropped out early. BACKSPARK ducked out at the start dislodging her rider but walked off the course under her own
power after being collected by the outrider following the race. PER THE TAMPA BAY DOWNS STEWARDS OFFICE, SOUPSTER HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE
TO INELIGIBILITY.

Footnotes
JUDGE JUDITH, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, advanced to bid for command between foes on the far turn and
drove clear. MAGIC MIKAELA stalked just off the pacesetter along the inside to the backstretch, continued under patient handling conceding some position
on the far turn, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. RIPLEY EFFECT settled between foes racing to the backstretch,
switched out three wide nearing upper stretch while being urged to advance and continued with an effort to gain position while earning a share. LIBERTALIA
ducked out at the start, was righted to track off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, advanced three wide into the far turn to lodge a brief bid in
tandem with the eventual winner but flattened out in upper stretch. BASHFUL MARIE settled between foes in early stages and failed to gain striking
distance. SUWANNEE CHICK was settled along the inside early and never gained contention. SABELLE was urged setting the pace on a clear margin
along the rail to the backstretch but gave way once headed on the far turn. MALIBU SKY ducked a bit at the start, angled to the inside tracking just off the
second flight racing to the backstretch but faded early. CLASSIC REWIND broke awkwardly losing position at the start and trailed the field to the stretch.
GIGI'S DIAMOND proved no factor.
