head of the lane and drew off under steady encouragement. ERIN MHF raced off the early pace, roused four wide into the upper stretch, finished with
response and cleared second best. RB FASSYNATOR advanced into closer closer after opening stages, hustled along two wide around the turn, churned

COLORS OF THE WIND stalked up close through early stages, took command entering the far turn, widened advantage under steady urging and kept to
task in late stages. SO FULLY SUE rated near midpack through the backstretch, launched and outside bid at the head of the lane, finished with response
and gained second best. WALK SOFTLY settled in range through early stages, hustled up two wide into the lane, sustained steady response and captured
show. DREAM PIRE rated five wide through the backstretch, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and got edged late for show. GIRLS GOT
GAME was allowed to settle off the early pace, given cue along the outside in the lane and needed more for serious impact. CUPIDS LOVE was not too far
back in early stages, launched a two wide bid late on the far turn then chased evenly through the lane. CASHMERE DANCER rated inside through early
stages, shifted four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. AMERICAN DEPUTY settled and saved ground, tipped for wide for the drive and failed to move on.
IMMACULATE GLORY drifted five wide into the first turn, stalked up close through the backstretch, launched a bid around the far turn, raced up close then
gave way in the lane. SAGANAKI pressed the pace through the backstretch, ran on around the far turn then tired in the drive. SMILING ANGEL settled off
the early pace, raced wide into the lane and never menaced. STORMY CUT promoted the early pace and came up empty around the final turn.

through the backstretch, ran on through the turn then weakened. WITT AMERICA dueled two wide between foes in early stages then gave way. REGAL

Footnotes
SEA OF LIFE set a pressured pace through early stages then cleared and held firm around the turn, was ridden along two wide into the lane, dug in gamely
under firm handling and held on in final strides. WOO HOO stalked up close through the early going, launched a three wide bid midway around the turn,
stayed on determinedly through the lane, edged closer nearing the wire and just missed. ITS A GEE THING hustled along two wide through the turn,
sustained a two wide bid into the lane and outdueled rival for a share. COSMETOLOGY was ridden along three to four wide around the turn, stayed on with
response in the lane and got edged out late for show. SHEZA HUNK raced near the back, hustled up three wide around the turn and failed to kick on in the
lane. HIGH DEF RIDGE raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened. BLING ON THE LIGHT broke out at the start, raced in range
along the inside, continued a bid into the final furlong then gave way. DAVID'S DREAM GIRL prompted the pace along the inside, weakened entering the
turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
IMALUCKYCHARM showed speed and grabbed the early lead, set a pressured pace through the backstretch, continued to hold a slim lead around the far
turn, saved ground and roused for more at the head of the lane, had plenty left in reserve, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady
pressure. MISS B stalked inside through the backstretch, stayed inside around the far turn, tipped to the outside of IMALUCKYCHARM at the head of the
lane, showed good response but could not threaten the winner and had to settle for second best. HONOR GIVEN raced off the early pace, tucked inside
around the final turn, cut the corner and given cue along the inside entering the lane, ran on with response under firm handling and gathered a share.
SALTAMONTES DIVA was forwardly placed around the first turn, pressed the pace through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid around the far turn,
sustained three wide response to the furlong marker then gave way. KAUSE I'M DEVINE tracked the pace three wide, loomed a threat near the quarter pole
then flattened out entering the stretch and offered no late rally. TURN ON THE BLING spun out five wide into the first turn, settled outside off the early pace
and failed to rally when called upon entering the lane. AIRLINE DRIVE rated off the early pace, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch and had no
late response. DIXIE CARROUSEL settled and saved ground through early stages, tipped out around the far turn and failed to move on. FACESTER
tracked the pace two wide in range then faded around the far turn and continued to tire in the lane.
