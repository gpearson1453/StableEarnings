ESTA CHUCK was rated along three wide, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane, closed well under left handed urging, drew away in
the furlong grounds to prove much the best. PEACEARELLA stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage,
shook clear leaving the turn but was not match for the winner late, clearly second best. V W TURBO tracked the pace three to four wide, made a three wide
bid on the turn to press the pace, but flattened out, bested rest. LIFE IS ETERNAL was rated along the inside and lacked a rally. TINA BURNER set the
pace on the inside and was headed on the turn and gave way.
