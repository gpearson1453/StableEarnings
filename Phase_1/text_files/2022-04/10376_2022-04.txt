WATERS OF MEROM prompted the leader from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive steadily wearing down the leader to get up in the final jumps and prevail. DIAMOND COLLECTOR showed the way in hand
three then two wide patiently handled until set down spinning five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat through the length of the stretch and was
caught in the final strides to the finish. EARLY GLOW coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
cornered six to seven wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. TAP THE FAITH four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
went three then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and stayed on one paced to the wire. LONDON
GOLD five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs out, swung five to six wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NO BURN was well spotted just off the pace, brushed with a foe near the five-eighths, moved out into the turn, chased four then five wide around that bend,
made a bid while six wide into the stretch then took the advantage while drifting out some, was straightened by the rider at the eighth-pole, continued to drift
out slightly in the final furlong and proved best while held together in the end. ROAD TO SUCCESS went to the front, tugged hard at the bit under restraint
leaving the chute, showed the way while in hand, went around the turn in the three then four path, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought
with that foe into the final furlong and was outfinished while clear for the place. AIR SHOW tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the
backstretch, was urged four to five wide around the turn, moved out some under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while able to get
the show. FOREVER WICKED was checked by the rider at the start and spotted the front many lengths, moved out at the rear, went four wide early on the
turn then shifted to the six path and failed to threaten. CHARGER was urged along towards the back, angled out with about five furlongs to run, went three
wide early on the turn, shifted five wide at the five-sixteenths, dropped to the four path into the stretch and was no factor. DANGEROUS EDGE raced just off
the early pace, brushed with a foe while between horses around the five-eighths, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two to three wide through the
turn and faltered.

Footnotes
JADE'S DREAM broke out at the start brushing SUNDAESWITHSANDY while being corrected, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong to get up in the last jumps to the wire and prevail. UMBRIA got
bumped at the start by JUMPSTER and in turn bumped SANDRO THE GREAT, chased five then four wide in closest aim of that leader coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths and advancing to take command nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the
eighth pole, dug in under threat and was nailed in the final strides to the wire. JUMPSTER broke out at the start bumping UMBRIA into SANDRO THE
GREAT, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show
honors. RUN FOR BOSTON grew detached when devoid of speed early on seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under coaxing near the
half mile pole and tucked to the two path through the turn, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly to the finish.
SUNDAESWITHSANDY got brushed at the start by JADE'S DREAM, who broke outwards, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
went eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. SANDRO THE GREAT got bumped at the start by UMBRIA due to pressure from JUMPSTER breaking
outwards, showed the way in hand two to three wide coming under coaxing just inside the five-sixteenths when under threat for the initial time, got displaced
nearing the quarter pole and went five wide into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

Footnotes
ROCK SUGAR was hustled to the front, contested the pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the three then four path around the turn, moved clear outside the
quarter-pole, responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, remained on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the
proper lead and drew off under steady urging. EMPEROR'S CAUSE moved out while well placed just off the pace, chased three wide early on the turn,
shifted five wide at the five-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place.
REMEMBERMOM veered out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased five then six wide around the turn and missed the place while clear for
the show. CENTAVO broke out and bumped hard with a rival, settled comfortably off the pace, was roused in the four path on the turn and lacked the
needed response. COUSTEAU disputed the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the two path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and
tired. BLU GROTTO was bumped hard at the start then slow into stride, dropped well behind early, went four wide around the turn and was no factor. MY
BROTHER NEIL was bumped hard at the start and forced strongly into another opponent, moved in under urging around the three-quarter pole, went three
wide through the turn and was no factor.

GUNS BLAZING five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive through
the final furlong tipping out through to the finish as the top pair came out and was up in the final jumps to score. BIG AL'S GAL four paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, latched on the leader
and dug in, the rider switching his crop to the left hand a furlong out, came out and bumped QUALITY STONES just inside that station, continued under a
left hand crop and carried out that rival eight additional paths brushing her just inside the sixteenth marker, got up for the place honors on the wire while
missing for it all. QUALITY STONES showed the way in hand four to five paths off the inside, tucked three wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing
at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was bumped by the aforementioned foe just inside the eighth pole, got
herded out eight paths to the finish as BIG AL'S GAL continued outwards under a left handed stick, was brushed just inside the sixteenth marker, then got
caught by a pair in the final jumps to the wire. MAGNETIQUE four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid tipping out late as rivals inside came
outwards. ADDILYN eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, went six wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung
nine wide at the top of the stretch, kept on to the wire but was outfinished. MY GIRL LEXI coaxed from the gate, chased three to four paths off the inside
down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coaxed along from midway, continued two to three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the
finish but was outfinished in the late going. LADY BY CHOICE six then five wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into
upper stretch and offered no response. SIRENIC five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting put to coaxing at
the three-eighths, tipped four wide into upper stretch and trailed. There was a Stewards' Inquiry focusing on the pair of BIG AL'S GAL and QUALITY
STONES in the stretch run before the result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

Footnotes
SCOCCIATORE broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the four path, gained eight wide into the stretch, took the lead
while still on his inside lead around the three-sixteenths, swapped to the proper lead coming to the eighth-pole then edged clear in the final furlong under
strong urging. AMERICAN GENTLEMAN was urged along towards the front, chased in the five path around the turn, was driven nine wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner to the wire and finished with good courage for the place. DANCING BUCK was hustled from the start then hard ridden off the pace,
chased two then three wide on the turn, gained seven wide into the stretch, made a bid between horses at the three-sixteenths but was outfinished while
clear for the show. REJECTED AGAIN broke a half-step tardy, was urged along towards the back, went three then four wide on the turn, moved closer
under a strong drive into upper stretch, reached a reasonable striking range into the final furlong but flattened out and lacked the needed response. R BOY
BODE was hustled from the outside post then sped clear, went around the turn in the four path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into the
stretch under heavy pressure, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths and tired. TRASH TALKER showed speed on the inside of R
BOY BODE, was taken back off the pace nearing the five-eighths then switched to the outside, chased six wide around the turn, was carried ten wide into
the stretch and capitulated. CASTLE CHAOS broke a half-step slow, was ridden along at the rear on the outside, went five to six wide through the turn,
came seven wide into the stretch and faltered.

pole, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe to prevail. LORD GATLING
chased seven then six paths off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered six to seven wide into upper stretch, closed well through the
stretch to be along for the place honors while well clear of the rest and second best. WE READY five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. FAZARO four then three
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, tipped six to seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MISTER J T chased five wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, weakened in the stretch. IRIE SPICE chased just off the inside under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths and made no late headway. ANGELI BLU hustled from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. EXCEPTIONAL chased six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide into upper
stretch, tired. HARDLY WORKING chased five then four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three to four wide for home and tired. ANY
