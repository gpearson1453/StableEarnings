was through early while evenly with no gain in the stretch run. STATE OF GRACE never menaced. BEAUTIFUL LASS dropped far back. SWEET RED

stretch for place spot. RAULITO unhurried to the turn, wide run into stretch, ralled along for show. KING T'CHALLA inside speed to the stretch, faded in the
final furlong. PEERLESS COURT broke slow with an inside run, saved ground to no avail. MONKEY ZONE could not keep to the turn with nothing left for
the stretch run. BAD BOY E. J. tried hard to the turn, came up empty in the drive. SKY BOLT lost best chance at the start, moved up stretch, flattened out.
CALL PAPA never menaced. RESTITUTION never menaced at any pole. FATTERTHANME sharp speed inside to the turn, gave way readily and dropped
