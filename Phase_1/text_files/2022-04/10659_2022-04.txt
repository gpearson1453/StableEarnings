SNOW SQUALL was rated was rated along early four wide, then was three wide on the turn and asked around the five sixteenths, came four wide into the
drive and closed well on the outside to get up in deep stretch and edge away late, driving. SUPER LEGGERA was settled early while two wide, then was
between horses nearing the five sixteenths, then came two wide into the drive and rallied, got place award late. SASSY MARTINI was off a step slow, then
hustled along to set the pace while two wide. BORN TO BE GOOD was bumped after the start, stalked the pace thtrr wide and lacked the needed kick in the
drive. SIMPLE SOUVENIR hopped at the start, settled early and was four wide on the turn and had no rally. POOLSIDE MANNERS was well placed early
on the inside and weakened on the turn.

NICE COMPANY dueled for the early lead and made a two wide bid leaving the turn and kicked clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under a drive.
MS. P'S BELLA chased the early pace three wide, eased out nearing the quarter pole and swung out five wide leaving the turn and finished willingly to be
second best. REMEMBEROLDTYMES stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out. DIXIEWISH was rated along
early, saved ground on the turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn but had no punch. DANCE FOR GOLD dueled for the lead on the inside and
weakened in the drive. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER was settled early and was four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had no rally. THANKS
LAURA lacked a rally. SERENDIPIA was void of early speed and came four wide into the drive and was not a threat. NUMBER ONE HIT was outrun early
on the inside, shifted off the inside in the drive and had no response, no factor.

Footnotes
ANTIGONE was well rated to the five sixteenths, then made a three wide bid, took over leaving the three sixteenths and drew off in the final furlong to prove
much the best under right handed crop urging. CEFALO set the unchallenged pace while racing off the rail, was headed leaving the turn and proved to be
no match for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. WICKED MIAH was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn to be in
range leaving the turn but flattened out, bested rest. FLAT OUT VIXEN was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had no rally. AMI'S LINK was
reserved early, then was two wide on the turn and lacked a late rally. FLECK was outrun early and failed to menace. CHEEKY PINT was settled early on the
inside and tired.

Footnotes
SWINGING MANDY was well placed early in between rivals in the two path, made a two wide bid leaving the turn and shook clear by the sixteenth pole,
then held off SPIDER BELLE late to prove best under a drive. SPIDER BELLE was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn, tipped out three wide
leaving the turn for aim, closed well to just miss. SWIRLING DANCER set a pressured pace on the inside early, shook clear by the quarter pole and then
faded late, held show award. BLAZING SKY pressed the early pace three wide, came four wide into the drive and faded. VESPOLINA was settled back
early, advanced on the turn and was on the inside at the quarter pole and then offered a late rally. MY GIRL SKY tracked the early pace and was four wide
on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had no kick. SHES THE NORTH was allowed to settle early, raced five wide on the turn and weakened.
FORESTERS PRINCESS was allowed to settle early and lacked a rally. MOONLIT SILENCE tracked the early pace from the inside, then was in tight and
had to check entering the far turn and dropped out to the back. The Stewards posted INQUIRY into running around the three eighths marker and after
review they disqualified SWINGING MANDY from first and placed her ninth.

Footnotes
FREDERICIA was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, eased out nearing the quarter pole and came four wide ionto the drive, closed
well to get up late under a drive. ZISISIT (IRE) pressed the early pace and made a two wide bid by the quarter pole, shook clear by the furlong marker and
was caught in deep stretch, held place award. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH broke awkwardly and was off slowly, then chased the front runners four wide
entering the turn, then was five wide by the quarter pole and came six wide into the drive and finished willingly but needed more late. HIGH TREASON was
settled early between rivals, then was two wide by the quarter pole and had no kick in the drive. LOAD ABROAD set a pressured pace on the inside and
then dueled for command by the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. SKINNY DIPPIN was fractious in the post parade, prompted pace three wide and
weakened. SALADA chased the pace on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTION GAL set a pressured pace on the inside early while dawdling along, drifted out leaving the turn and then was roused and responded well,
then was shown the crop in the final sixteenth while clear to prove best. WARWOMAN pressed the winner throughout two to three wide, then was carried
out leaving the turn and proved to be no match for that rival while clearly second best. LADY BREW broke in the air and was off slowly, lagged behind early,
made a bid run on the turn and then was five wide by the quarter pole, then finished evenly late, bested rest. LIVIN ON LUV was rated along early and made
a mild bid on the turn but was empty in the drive. SWOOP TO FINISH was rated along three wide early, then was two wide by the quarter pole and
weakened. ASTONISH stalked the pace four wide and weakened. CRACKLE CANDY chased the early pace three wide and weakened.

LADY MAEVE (IRE) was rated along early and made a three wide move in hand on the turn, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best under mild
urging. SUSPICIOUS MINDS was allowed to settle early, made a four wide bid leaving the turn but could not sustain that bid while staying on to be second
best. CLASSIC QUEEN tracked the pace on the inside, then was blocked leaving the quarter pole, shifted out three wide leaving the turn and finished
willingly. HALLANVAARA was reserved early, came four wide into the drive and had no rally while passing the tiring rivals. TOTAL BETTY tracked the
earlyu pace and was in between rivals on the turn and was empty in the drive. MOON POOL was void of early speed, came five wide into the drive and had
no rally. BLUE TWIRLIN rushed up the inside to set the pace on the inside and gave way. PHIL IN ECHO failed to menace.
