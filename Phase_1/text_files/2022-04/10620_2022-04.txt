ACHANCETOWIN broke sharply, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, opened up entering the stretch and remained
clear to the wire while drifting out in the final furlong. GABY'S PROMISE raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn
and gained ground late between horses while proving to be no match for the winner. SHE'S A FAIR CATCH chased the leaders on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and made a mild improvement of position late. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL chased the frontrunners a bit
keenly through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. C C CROWN'S CHOICE dueled for the lead up the
backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. ARKANSAS BLING trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, improved position mildly while swinging wide into the stretch and flattened out from there. SHANGHAI

Footnotes
ONE TIME GEM bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, pressed the pace while saving ground around the first turn, moved up to duel on the
inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, and continued to battle gamely down the lane to prevail while drifting mildly in late stretch. GETCHA led
the field from the three path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the far turn, gave way in upper stretch and chased
gamely to the wire, the best of the rest. HIGH RIDGE raced in the three path around the first turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
dropped back to chase the leaders from the three path around the second turn and was outkicked from there. MY BOOK bumped with the horse to her
inside leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to move up while saving ground around the far
turn and flattened out in the lane. OXBOW WIND raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began
to drop back while coming around the far turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
MIKE J dueled on the outside in the early going, began to edge clear while racing in the two path around the turn, and drew off down the lane, much the
best. BASEBALL LOVER dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, could not go with the winner entering the
stretch and chased that rival home, the best of rest. XANTHUS WRATH chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and gained ground on the inside late. JEFFROW chased the leaders on the outside in the early going, raced in the three path around the turn and
finished evenly. DREWMAZING bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the two path, bumped fairly significantly with BIG RESULTS near the eighth pole and made no bid. STAR AND A HALF trailed the field on the outside
up the backstretch, swung wide headed into the turn, entered the stretch from the five path and was empty from there. BIG RESULTS chased the leaders
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, bumped with DREWAMAZING with a furlong to go and weakened between horses in late
stretch.
