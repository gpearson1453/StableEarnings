Footnotes
ZU ZU FLYNN tracked the moderate pace from a two wide path, was roused leaving the turn, overtook the pacesetter approaching the furlong marker and
kicked clear in the end. MIGHTY BOISTEROUS was off a bit slow and lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, shifted out while improving
position leaving the furlong marker and closed well late to be best of the rest. ACTION FOR AUTISM chased the pace two wide, gained ground nearing the
quarter marker but could not go on with that effort, while clear of the rest for third. CLOSED CIRCUIT chased the moderate pace from the inside and gave
way in the stretch run. LIL TINKER lacked early speed and did not have a late response. LADY SKYWALKER was hustled leaving the break and showed
early speed while opening a clear lead through the turn, was overtaken by the winner nearing the furlong marker and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
TESORO stalked the pace on the first turn, advanced along the backstretch to keep close attendance to the pace, confronted the pacesetter nearing the
quarter marker, took a narrow edge into the stretch run, was headed by LONG LANCE nearing the furlong marker and determinedly dug in in the final
sixteenth to prevail. LONG LANCE stalked the pace from an inside position, loomed two wide nearing the quarter marker, confronted TESORO approaching
the furlong grounds, vied for the lead with that rival and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while besting the rest. RIJEKA (IRE) settled off of the pace
while saving ground, advanced in upper stretch, was outfinished by the top two in the final stages but went by tiring foes to be an easy third in the end.
JUNGLE CRY was never far back while sitting just off of the pace, was shuffled three then four wide on the second turn and tired in the drive.
PERFECTIONISTIC was hustled leaving the break and showed good early speed while setting fast fractions, came under pressure from TESORO nearing
the quarter marker, could not hold that one off leaving the second turn and faded in the late stages.

ALWAYS SEEKING saved ground while stalking the early pace, tipped out leaving the turn, made a steady gain through mid-stretch, headed VASCO inside
of the sixteenth marker and made a late surge to prevail. EXTINGUISHER was a bit slow in the early stages, chased the quick pace from the inside through
the turn, rallied in the final furlong and could not quite reel in the winner in the end but secured second in the final strides. VASCO broke alertly and was
hustled to the front, showed good speed while carving out fast fractions through the turn, was clear into the final furlong but was caught inside of the final
sixteenth and was just edged out for the place. CALLMEMARTHAJANE was sandwiched at the start, recovered to track the quick pace from a two then
three wide path on the turn and closed willingly in the final furlong. ONE SILK STOCKING was forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace to the quarter
marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. COUSIN NIECEY was a bit slow leaving the break, lacked early speed while saving
ground and did not mount a late rally.

DEL MAR FLASH broke alertly and was sent to set the early pace, set pedestrian fractions through the backstretch run, was headed by BORN TO REIGN
nearing the quarter marker, battled with that foe but determinedly dug in through the lane and proved best in the end. BORN TO REIGN stalked the early
pace then advanced along the backstretch run to prompt the fractions into the second turn, confronted DEL MAR FLASH nearing the quarter marker, battled
through the stretch but could not get by that determined rival and was bested in the end, while clear for second. NICOLE GRACE settled just off of the early
pace, gained ground two wide on the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while holding safely for third.
ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was three wide while settling off of the pace into the first turn, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn but could not go on
with that effort and faltered in the late stages. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD was pinched at the start and away a bit slowly, settled off of the pace, was roused
two wide on the second turn and offered a mild late gain. GOOD TIME DOLLY was three wide while up close into the first turn, gained ground three wide on
the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. MISS EVER READY saved ground while tracking the pace and gave way in the drive. SUMMER
APPARITION was allowed to settle in the early stages, was steered three wide along the second turn and lacked a late response.

SASSYSERB was up close on the first turn while saving ground, advanced position nearing the second turn, was set down for the drive along the inside,
took a narrow edge into the final furlong, was all out in the final sixteenth and held on for the win. ASSIGNATION saved ground while settling off of the early
pace, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, shifted out a path nearing the furlong grounds, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and just
missed for the win while clear of the rest for second. REIWA was content to settle in the early going, advanced on the second turn while two wide between
foes, continued that bid to vie for the lead nearing the furlong marker but was outfinished in the late stages while holding for third. SCHERZO (GB) saved
ground while tracking the early pace, was steered three wide on the second turn, improved in the final furlong but was outkicked in the end. EMPIRE
HOUSE broke alertly and while in hand commanded the early pace, set reasonable fractions through the second turn, came under pressure nearing the
furlong marker and gave way in the late going. JOYMAKER prompted the early pace while a bit keen on the first turn, lost ground to the pacesetter on the
backstretch run, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was off a bit slowly and was unhurried early on, maintained a
three wide path through the backstretch run and then came four wide on the second turn and lacked a late response.

IL BELLATOR saved all of the ground while just off of the pace, shifted three wide nearing the the head of the lane, closed well under firm encouragement in
the final furlong, confronted CABO SPIRIT in the final strides and dug in to prevail. BOISE tracked the pace from a two wide path, was roused nearing the
quarter marker, was steered four wide into the drive, made a good late rally and was just nipped for the win while earning the nod for the place. CABO
SPIRIT was three wide along the first turn, stalked the pace through the half-mile marker, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, edged
clear in upper stretch, could not hold off the late rally of the top two and was tagged for the win, while well clear of the rest for third. IL CAPITANO broke
alertly and was sent to the front, set solid fractions while being prompted by CABO SPIRIT, came under pressure at the head of the lane and weakened in
the final stages. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH was three then four wide on the first turn while never far back, advanced along the backstretch run, lost ground
three wide on the second turn and tired in the drive.

AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) settled off of the quick early pace while two wide, was roused four wide on the second turn, made a good rally through the lane,
confronted BUYBACK in the final stages and determinedly bested that game foe to prevail. BUYBACK broke alertly and was headed by NORTHWEST
FACTOR soon after the break, dueled for pace duties with that rival through the second turn while setting quick fractions, continued that duel into upper
stretch, was able to separate from NORTHWEST FACTOR in the final sixteenth but was confronted by the winner in the final stages and was gamely bested
in the end, while clear of the rest. NORTHWEST FACTOR engaged with BUYBACK soon after the start and dueled on the front end with that rival,
continued that duel in upper stretch, could not match strides with the top pair in the final sixteenth and was outfinished, while holding for third. SLOANE
GARDEN (GB) saved ground early on while settling off of the dueling pacesetters, advanced three wide on the second turn, continued that gain in upper
stretch but lacked room in the final furlong and did not mount a late bid. MISTY CAT saved all of the ground while settling off of the quick early pace,
improved position on the second turn but did not have the needed late kick in the drive. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled just off of the early pace while two
wide on the first turn, advanced two then three wide nearing the quarter marker but did not offer a final late bid. BUBBLES ON ICE (IRE) was unhurried in
the early stages, maintained a two wide path through the second turn and lacked a late rally. MISS ADDIE PRAY broke in the air and spotted the field
leaving the break, settled off of the pace while saving ground and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA was a bit fractious in the gate, took back on the first turn to settle off of the pace, advanced nearing the half-mile marker, loomed
three wide entering the second turn, overtook SOO BROOKLYN leaving the three-eighths marker, extended the lead into the drive and pulled away in the
end. MUSIC FESTIVAL saved ground on the first turn while close up, advanced on the second turn, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch but dug in
in the late stages to earn the nod for second. SHE'S GOT A WAY crowded SPARKA on the run into the first turn, was unhurried while two wide through the
backstretch run, advanced three wide on the second turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and was just edged for second in the final
strides, while well clear of the rest for third. SPARKA (IRE) was crowded and bothered by SHE'S GOT A WAY on the run into the first turn, settled off of the
pace while saving ground, was steered four wide on the second turn and did not have a late response. DISTORTED QUEEN was forwardly placed while
tracking the quick early pace, was shuffled back while in tight quarters entering the second turn and weakened in the stretch. SOO BROOKLYN was off in
good order and was sent to the front, set quick early fractions while on a clear lead, was collared by the winner entering the second turn and faded in the
late stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING SPARKA AND SHE'S GOT A WAY ON THE RUN INTO THE
FIRST TURN AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER STEMMING FROM THE
INCIDENT.

EVENING SUN (GB) settled two wide off of the early pace, advanced on the second turn, tipped out for the drive, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth
and had a late surge to prevail. VANZZY settled just off of the early pace while two wide on the first turn, was roused nearing the quarter marker while two
wide between foes, angled out at the top of the stretch, was put to firm encouragement through the final sixteenth while closing fast and was just bested in
the final strides, while getting up for the place. CAMINO DEL PARAISO was three wide on the first turn while forwardly placed, advanced on the second
turn, continued that run in upper stretch to vie for the lead approaching the furlong marker, edged to a clear lead nearing the sixteenth pole but was caught
and outfinished by the top pair, while holding for third. TOM'S SURPRISE took back leaving the break and was allowed to settle while saving ground, was
roused leaving the second turn, rallied well through the stretch run while in traffic and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. INDIAN PEAK was just off of the
rail while tracking the early pace from the midflight, gained ground in upper stretch, was outclosed in the final sixteenth and was just edged out for the minor
awards. TIZ PLUS kept close attendance to the fast pace through the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. FREEPORT
JOE was away slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, was steered three wide on the second turn and finished well in the final furlong.
RESTRAINEDVENGENCE was allowed to settle early on while keeping a three wide path, was roused nearing the quarter marker, steadied off of heels and
shifted out at the head of the lane and found his best stride late. JIMMY BLUE JEANS was hustled leaving the break, was sent to the front and set fast
fractions while being pressed, took a narrow lead into the stretch, was overtaken approaching the furlong marker and tired in the late going. DELAWARE

Footnotes
ULTIMATE BANGO saved ground early on while chasing the fast pace, tipped out two wide for the drive, headed ANYPORTINASTORM inside of the
sixteenth marker, found a late gear and just held to prevail over the oncoming runner-up. STRONGCONSTITUTION chased the pace from the midflight
while three deep, angled out leaving the bend and gained ground in upper stretch, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while
clear for second. ANYPORTINASTORM was hustled leaving the break and engaged BETTOR TRIP NICK while dueling for early pace duties, set fast
fractions through the turn, edged to a clear lead in midstretch but was outfinished late by the top pair and just held on for third. MURPHYS TIGER tracked
the fast pace three wide on the turn, rallied into the stretch run and continued that bid through the final sixteenth, just missing for third. COOL MOUNTAIN
LAD chased the fast pace from the inside, was in tight leaving the quarter marker, shifted out at the head of the lane, steadied in traffic approaching the
furlong marker and was outkicked in the final stages. CLEM LABINE was void of early speed, was steered three wide on the turn and found his best stride
late. NERO steadied in traffic at the break, chased the pace outside of foes on the turn and did not offer a late bid. ITALIANO lacked early speed, advanced
two wide in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. TOP EXECUTIVE chased the fast pace three wide through the turn and tired in the drive.
BETTOR TRIP NICK broke alertly and was sent to the front, was engaged by ANYPORTINASTORM and dueled with that rival through fast opening
fractions through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and faded through the late stages.

Footnotes
SADIE BLUEGRASS tracked the pace two deep through the turn, found a seam approaching the furlong marker, responded with a quick move to strike the
front and kicked clear in the end. REBALATION took back off of the fast early pace, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch run, made a bold late rally and
could not reel in the winner in the end but was up in time for second. DYNASTY OF HER OWN was forwardly placed while three wide through the early
going, gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished by the winner and was edged for second in the final strides by the oncoming runner-up. RAKASSAH
(IRE) was shuffled back in the early stages and chased the fast pace three deep on the turn, rallied leaving the bend and finished well in the final sixteenth
to challenge for the show. NEVER FOR MONEY chased the fast early pace from the inside, gained ground to vie for the lead nearing the furlong marker and
was outkicked in the drive. FAIRY TALE BLISS was squeezed at the start and off a bit slowly, lacked early speed while three wide, advanced leaving the
furlong marker and found her best stride late. CAROLINA MIA broke sharply and showed good early speed while contesting the early pace, overtook
LOTSA PEPPER to take a narrow lead into the final furlong but could not go on with that run and gave way in the late stages. GRINNINGEARTOEAR
lacked early speed while saving ground and was not a factor. TIP TOP GAL chased the fast pace from an inside path and weakened in the late going.
LOTSA PEPPER was hustled leaving the break and set the disputed early pace, took a narrow edge into the turn, extended the lead nearing the quarter
marker, came under pressure in upper stretch, ceded the lead approaching the furlong grounds and faded late.

Footnotes
BOTTLE OF SMOKE gained a forward position after the start, rated kindly behind the leaders in the two-path down the backstretch, awaited room on the
turn, swung five wide into the late and finished strongly. WINE AND WHISKY away alertly on the rail, adjusted path around the first turn to a stalking position
behind DRAW THE FOUL, dueled with that rival through the far turn, gained an advantage in the final furlong while racing on the wrong lead but could not
hold off the winner. ROCKTILLYOUDROP dropped over to the rail going into the first turn, steadily gained ground down the backstretch to gain contention
into the far turn while maintaining an inside position, drove through a hole created when DRAW THE FOUL floated out entering the stretch, finished with
good energy but couldn't match the top pair. FRIDAY'S AT SHADY broke in at the break, brushing with FINAL FINAL, settled mid-pack early, dropped back
a bit while shifting to the five path around the first turn, remained in the rear flank under stout restraint, quickened when asked around the turn and finished
with interest while no threat to the leaders. DRAW THE FOUL away quickly, gained the lead without being asked, dove to the rail causing AUTISMS
WORLD to check, settled into a comfortable rhythm down the backside, responded when challenged by WINE AND WHISKY on the outside and
ROCKTILLYOUDROP on the inside, floated out a bit entering the stretch and weakened late. FINAL FINAL broke out and brushed with FRIDAY'S AT
SHADY at the break, had no early speed, began a steady run under heavy pressure around the turn, made a seven-wide bid entering the stretch and
finished evenly while passing tiring rivals. AUTISMS WORLD quick from the gate, challenged for the early lead, checked when DRAW THE FOUL crossed
over, swung four wide down the backstretch while in the leading group, was asked to move on the leaders passing the three furlong marker while still wide
but could not offer the needed response and flattened out in the drive. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY outrun early, attempted to move inside to save ground but
was forced wide by POUR ON THE COLE entering the turn, maintained a rearward position while widest of all to the half mile pole then dropped well behind
the field into the turn, dropped to the inside but had nothing to offer. BARHOPSKY out well, forced POUR ON THE COLE out to the four-path on the first
turn, settled mid-pack, maintained position but could not keep up with the field in the final quarter. POUR ON THE COLE broke with the pack, was forced a
bit wide by BARHOPSKY into the first turn, raced four-wide near the back and could not offer any response in the late stages.
