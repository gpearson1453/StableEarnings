Footnotes
FEARNOUGHT was a bit reluctant to load, gave early chase and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the turn and
was steadily handled to hold on. ROCKING TO HOME gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, dueled for second inside the eighth pole and
finished well to gain on the winner. JUBA JUNIOR exchanged contact with Black Shadow on the chute then pressured the pace, steadied at the inside flank
of Fearnought in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, came through the turn in the three path then weakened the final furlong. JUBA'S YANKEE ONE gave
chase inside, eased out nearing the head of the lane and showed little more. BLACK SHADOW exchanged contact with Juba Junior on the chute then never
factored. JOKES R FLYING accelerated to the lead leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, was caught approaching the quarter pole, dropped
back midway on the turn and weakened.

three path, angled five wide into the lane and closed with a burst of speed to get up at the wire. HOLIDAY AVENUE settled off the pace about the three
path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was
caught under the wire. LUNAR IMAGE raced off the pace about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran close in the four path of the far
turn, but flattened later yards. CITIZEN'S FIRE drifted into the first turn and left the turn wide, bid past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the
five path and dug in widest in an even finish. TRIGZ TOO saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn
and finished evenly. TOMMY PIES raced off the pace two deep the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, angled to the six path

Footnotes
TIZBIT tapered in to stalk the early pace about the three path, started a four wide bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead at the five sixteenths,
drew clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled in the stretch. FASHION ICON stumbled at the break then rated close inside the first turn, eased
out to stalk three wide into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and dueled between horses from the three eighths, raced close at
the rail on the far turn but had to settle for second. BETTER BOAT raced well off the pace two deep on the opening turn, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, angled to the outside leaving the turn, came along for third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. WHIZ
PASS saved ground well off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened from mid-stretch. SARAH
BELLUM raced well off the pace in the three and four paths the first turn, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole and ran in the four path of the far turn.
PARTLY DANDY raced with the early pace two deep, dueled RHYTHM TREE from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. The
latter rated a slim lead inside, dueled Partly Dandy from the seven sixteenths pole but gave way at the rail on the far turn. BYEGONE DAYS raced off the
early pace about the three path and was through after a half mile.

strides. FIBER AND EMILY rated a slim lead off the rail, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail midway on the far turn
then flattened inside the eighth pole. FANCY CONCHO saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and eased to the four path on the
far turn, then flattened. COMMAND THE CAT settled off the pace inside, gave chase into the backstretch, eased to the four path on the far turn and showed
little in the lane. WITH SECRET ENERGY became very fractious in the gate and saved ground. HERO'S MAN stalked inside, challenged at the three
eighths pole and raced close to the mid point of the turn, then weakened. The Stewards reviewed then dismissed a claim of foul against the rider of Penguin
Power, lodged by the rider of Fiber And Emily, for alleged interference leaving the far turn.
