Footnotes
SMOKEYMOUNTAINRAIN pressed the issue early while along the inside, fell back off the leader late in the turn, moved out, rebid from between rivals, best.
JUSTIN SPEIGHT broke alertly, set the pace just off the inside, continued to show the way through the turn and into the stretch while in the two path, briefly
raced on equal terms with the winner then could not keep pace late, clear for the place. ELUSIVE FREUD prompted the pace while racing in the three path,
remained with striking distance into the stretch, was going evenly nearing the furlong grounds when rider lost whip, continued one paced to the wire to finish
best of the rest. PIKACHU off a step slow, raced back in the two path, passed tiring rivals with some belated interest, no real threat. LEAD OFF broke
tardily, remained back in failing to threaten. WILDCAT HAGRID broke back and failed to menace while saving ground. GOOD BYE CHARLIE off a step
slow, four wide into the lane when behind the first flight, gave way.

Footnotes
DR. FORMAN forwardly placed while racing inside, continued to save ground in a forward position through the turn, called on for some run into the lane,
challenged along the rail nearing the furlong marker, edging clear late in a determined effort. PULL MY CHAIN took command after the start, set the pace in
the two path, held a slight advantage nearing midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late while gamely holding the place. CAPTURE THE GLORY
pressed the pace in the two path, lost ground to the winner turning for home, got back to the from with a furlong to run, outkicked by the top two late, gained
the nod for the show. HONORARY DEGREE broke out, was straightened to race within striking distance outside, four wide through the turn, also lost
ground to the top two exiting the turn, narrowly missed the show. ALEX'S STRIKE last to leave, trailed early, improved position a bit without posing a serious
threat. SEEK N JUSTICE in mid pack while racing outside, five wide through the turn, failed to rally. OLSON in mid pack in the run up the backstretch,
began a steady fade before a half. SMART TIME was finished early while racing toward the inside.

BURRITO broke alertly, allowed the leaders to go, within striking distance through the turn along the inside, shifted out a bit to be in the two path for the
drive, finished up evenly. DIXIE PENNY forwardly placed off the inside, asked along, angled out four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing kick. FULLY

Footnotes
FLASHY BIZ raced behind the pace while outside, three wide late turn when moving closer, took over approaching the furlong marker, drove clear. WICKED
STREET narrowly set the pace while along the inside, held a slight advantage when straightened for home, proved no match for the winner late. VERY
SPICY in the second flight up the backstretch while racing off the inside, dropped inside turn, shifted out a bit for the stretch run, briefly challenged between
the top two with a furlong remaining, failed to keep pace, narrowly saved the show by gaining the nod. FORTUNA ADIUVAT off a step slow, raced back,
came four wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally to miss the show. MISS RITA pressed the issue for a half from the outside, began to weaken turning for
home. ITALIAN TWIN flashed brief speed between horses and began to steadily retreat before a half.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE COOL broke on top, pressed the issue up front along the inside for five furlongs, took over in hand late backstretch, steadily increased
advantage under a moderate hand ride to win ridden out. SUMMER IN MALIBU closest to the leaders off the inside when five wide into the first turn, angled
in, three wide onto the backstretch, advanced while still in the three path second turn, proved no match for the winner through the lane, clearly second best.
MR. THUNDERSTRUCK void of speed, came four wide out of the final turn when beginning a mild rally, far clear of the rest, no threat to the top pair. JAY
VEE BEE settled in mid pack while working way to the inside first turn, saved ground through the second turn, went evenly through the stretch. CHISHOLM
TRAIL last away, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals late after the issue had been decided. FRA MAURO remained always back in
lacking a response. UNCLE MO'S CAT narrowly set the pace for five furlongs in the two path, stopped late in the second turn.

Footnotes
REPLETE last away, moved up steadily in the run up the backstretch, dropped to the insid entering the turn, put a head in front late turn, extended stretch
duel, drifted out slightly, brushed, gained nod. CARL G with the pace from the start while between horses, hooked up with the winner outside that one
turning for home, floated out by that rival the final furlong, narrowly missed, clear of the others. STORMIN HONGKONG broke alertly, prompted the issue up
the backstretch well wide, five path into the turn, four wide exiting, slowly gaining on the top two. LOVER BOY in mid pack early outside, also raced five wide
down to four path through the turn, failed to muster a rally. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER away in good order, set or forced the pace between horses for a half
and began to weaken. TRAPPE VALLEY broke back, lacked speed off the rail, dropped inside late in the turn then went evenly through the stretch in lacking
a closing response. PRAETORIAN off the pace and the inside, failed to muster a rally as well. JACK'S ADVANTAGE fell back to trail soon after the start and
was always outrun in showing little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. RACE WAS
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

MRS. BEANS broke alertly, dueled into the first turn when narrowly setting the pace, headed, fell back, moved out, rebid into second turn, drew out.
DINNER AT CRUMPIES forwardly placed off the inside through the first turn, raced three wide up the backstretch, asked along in the three path late in the
final turn, could do little with the winner through the lane, well clear of the others. TOPF ROAD RULES dueled early outside in the first turn, shook clear
before a half, moved inside, offered little resistance to the winner when confronted by that one midway on that turn, could not contain the runner up, lasted
for the show. SMOKIN BOOTS off a step slow, raced back and off the pace, raced three wide through the second turn, improved into the lane, gaining for
the show. BIG SUCCESS off slowly, raced back while angling out in the first turn, raced four wide through the second, not enough late for the show. REEF'S

Footnotes
LONE ROCK broke well from the inside, showed way into the first turn, relinquished lead to barnmate before a quarter, prompted that one into the stretch
the first time, was put in tight by that one a half mile in, again into the second turn, continued to forced the issue through the second turn, took over from
along the rail just before a half, came off the rail late in the final turn, drifted stretch,enough left to hold off the runner up. LAST SAMURAI settled off the
pace three wide, continued unhurried the middle mile, ,closer on the outside late in the third turn, steered inside the drifting winner with less that a furlong
remaining, late bid, denied. TENFOLD void of speed, saved ground throughout, moved closer along the inside late in the final turn, flattened out in the final
sixteenth when unable to hang with the top two. STRONG TIDE prompted the pace three wide for ten furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. WARBIRD
remained back and never menaced. GOALIE took over soon after the start, set the pace in the two path, put the winner in tight four furlongs in, did so again
into the second turn, displaced on the lead by that one just before a half, stopped, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
LOCHMOOR broke back, lacked speed up the backstretch just off the inside, swung out five wide exiting the turn, finished with good energy down the
middle of the track to be up in time. SKYPED allowed the pace to go early while outside, four wide through the turn, advanced upper stretch, bid, led late,
caught in the final strides. ALLO ENRY lacked speed inside, saved ground through the turn, steered out twice through the stretch, displayed some late
interest to kick the trifecta. BILLHILL was one paced off the inside, two path turn, lacked a closing purnch. MACHO RONNIE broke alertly, attempted to lug
in up the backstretch, continued to contest the issue through the turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, faltered in the late going.
MALINTENT away in good order, moved up to take command before a quarter, set a quick set of early fractions along the inside, gave way in the drive.
TRAFFIC CONTROL remained back off the inside, angled out late in the turn, not a threat. AUX ARCS within striking distance while off the inside, three
wide through the turn when still forward, faltered in the stretch. SECRET SURVIVOR off a step slow, remained always back while racing just off the inside.
MORE THAN HAMAZING reared at the start to spot the field several lengths, remained always back.
