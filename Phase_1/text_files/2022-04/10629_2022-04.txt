HERE'S WALDO was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, closed well on the outside and got up late under
left handed crop urging to prove best. LOXODROME was sent to the front to set the pace on the inside while clear, then turned back the bid from MR
FANTASY leaving the turn, dug in gamely in the furlong grounds but was caught late, good effort. MR FANTASY tracked the pace and made a three wide
bid nearing the quarter pole but came up empty the final furlong. LONG TOM was reserved early, then was two wide on the turn and lacked a rally.

nearing the sixteenth pole and could not go with the winner late, second best. FAIRY DUST was well placed on the inside, shifted off the inside by the
quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and was empty. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS chased the early pace three wide and swung out four wide for the drive
