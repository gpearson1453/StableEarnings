Footnotes
DARKSABER was sent leaving the start, engaged with POTENTE ALBA soon after the break and dueled for pace duties with that rival through the turn
while opening a long lead on the rest, kicked clear leaving the furlong marker and held sway in the end. CAJUN BETTOR chased the pace two wide on the
turn, improved position in upper stretch, could not reel in the winner in the end but mounted a good late rally and was up for second in the late stages.
POTENTE ALBA was hustled leaving the break after an alert start, was engaged by the winner in the early stages and dueled with DARK SABER through
the turn, gave ground to that foe nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the end, while well clear of the rest for third. CASH LIMIT chased the early
pace, was three wide outside of rivals on the turn and did not offer a late response. HARDY CHISEL was void of early speed and did not mount a late rally.
HAWK'S RISING lacked early speed while chasing from the rear and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LOUD FUSAICHI bumped JANERO ROSE leaving the start, was sent in hand to dispute the early pace, drew to a clear lead nearing the top of the stretch,
was given a few reminders leaving the furlong marker and drew off late as much the best. ZAKKIYYAH tracked the pace three wide through the turn, was
outkicked by the winner in upper stretch, was no match for that one in the end but kept on to be best of the rest. GOLD RUSH GAL chased the quick early
pace four wide and passed tiring foes in the stretch run to be clear for third. JANERO ROSE was bumped by LOUD FUSAICHI leaving the break, saved
ground while chasing off of the pace through the turn and tired in the drive. P T RANGER kept attendance to the early pace, lost ground on the turn, was
outrun in upper stretch and faded through the late stages.

CROSSWORD broke sharply and took command in hand in the early going, set fast fractions while being prompted by LEMON ZINGER, was confronted by
that foe nearing the quarter marker, turned away that bid and kicked clear in the final stages. LEMON ZINGER pressed the early pace, advanced on
CROSSWORD nearing the quarter marker, was repelled in that effort and lost ground leaving the turn and was outkicked in the late stages, while holding for
second. BORKAN tracked the pace four wide outside of rivals, lost ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the end, while clear of the rest for third.
EL TENAMPA chased the fast pace two wide through the turn and did not mount a late rally. HANS GRUBER was a bit eager while on the inside on the run
into the turn, lost ground nearing the top of the stretch and faded in the final stages. OASIS was off a step slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, did not

Footnotes
EXECUTIVE CHEF was forwardly placed in the early going while saving ground, continued to save ground into the second turn, was roused leaving the
quarter marker, took a clear lead into the final furlong and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. RIMPROTECTOR was allowed to settle while
two to three wide on the first turn, was asked for run three wide on the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, closed well late and could not reel in the
winner in the end but was best of the rest. CAT GAMER hopped at the start and was hustled into early contention, attended the pace through the second
turn, was outkicked in upper stretch by the winner but kept on to be clear for third. M K HEART was unhurried early on, was steered four wide along the
second turn and did not have a late response. GOOD FOCUS broke alertly and took command of the early pace, set pedestrian fractions while being
prompted through the second turn, drifted out a path nearing the quarter-marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late going. FANTASTIC
DREAM was three wide while stalking the early pace into the backstretch run, maintained that three wide path through the second turn and gave way in the
stretch run. HUNTERS GHOST settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER saved all of the ground while chasing the early pace, advanced along the inside leaving the turn, took command into the final furlong
and kicked clear in the end. LORD BRANCUSI tracked the fast early pace, was fanned five wide leaving the three-eighths pole, was outkicked in the drive
by the winner but kept on to be best of the rest. TERRY'S BOY pressed the pace, was floated out a path when HAY JUAN drifted leaving the three furlong
marker, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides with the top two leaving the furlong marker and was outfinished late while
holding safely for third. HAY JUAN was sent leaving the break and took command of the quick early pace to the turn, drifted out leaving the three furlong
marker to go three wide through the turn, ceded the lead leaving the bend and weakened in the late going. HONG KONG COWBOY chased the early pace,
lost position nearing the turn, angled to the inside nearing the quarter marker and tired in the final stages. GO SMILEY GO bobbled at the start and was off a
step slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAGIC TIGER hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, was unhurried while saving ground in the early stages, was roused four wide on the second
turn, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, reeled in DARK PRINCE nearing the sixteenth marker and kicked clear in the end. SOUTHEAST ASIA
stalked the early pace from a two wide path on the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, was steered three wide on the second turn, was outkicked
by MAGIC TIGER in the drive but kept on in the final sixteenth to secure the place. DARK PRINCE broke alertly and was sent to the front, cleared the field
into the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, was clear into the final furlong but was caught approaching the sixteenth marker and
was outfinished in the late stages. SUGAR BEETS was three wide while off of the early pace on the first turn, was steered five wide on the far turn and
lacked a final late response. RAILSPLITTER was a bit keen on the run into the first turn while along the rail, tracked the moderate pace through the
backstretch run, gave way on the second turn and tired in the late stages. SEAHAWK CODY stalked the pace from a ground saving position early on, lost
ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch. CANYON CREST was off a bit slowly and lacked early speed to the first turn, was pushed along
through the backstretch run and onto the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HAPPY IS took back in the early stages to stalk the pace, was roused two wide leaving the quarter-marker, advanced past the pacesetter leaving the
second turn, and edged clear in the end over the oncoming runner-up. RUN FOR MY HONEY was three wide while settling off of the pace on the first turn,
advanced four then three wide on the second turn, closed in the final furlong and could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. ICY
BREEZE saved ground while tracking the pace from the midflight, was outkicked in upper stretch and lacked a final response in the drive but kept on to get
up for third. GRAZIN AT SUNRISE broke alertly and was sent to the front to show early speed, extended the lead nearing the half-mile marker, was caught
by the winner leaving the second turn and gave way in the late going. THREE DIMENSIONAL was shuffled at the start and was a bit slow in the early
stages, was unhurried through the second turn and lacked a late response. BELLEO'S FOREST was fractious in the gate, disputed the early pace on the
first turn, lost ground along the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and tired in the final stages. FROSTY DOLCE stalked the early pace three
wide, lost ground on the second turn while three deep and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY EYES prompted the moderate fractions through the half-mile marker, confronted SHE'S SO SHINY nearing the quarter pole, overtook that
rival leaving the second turn, kicked clear in the final furlong and held sway over the oncoming runner-up in the end. SKY MAKER was five wide into the first
turn then dropped in to be three wide along the first turn, was content to settle off of the early pace, was asked for run four wide on the second turn, closed
well leaving the bend and could not quite reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. REMEMBER SUE was four wide entering the first turn then
tucked in to settle off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run, lost position while two wide on the second turn and was outfinished in the
stretch run but kept on to be clear for third in the end. SHE'S SO SHINY broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions while being prompted
by the winner, lost the lead to BLUEBERRY EYES leaving the quarter marker and tired in the final stages. CHULA GIRL bobbled at the start, recovered well
to stalk the pace from an inside path, lost ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN was three wide on the first
turn while forwardly placed, lost position on the second turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
RUNNING LUCK kept close attendance to the early pace, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the half-mile marker, took command into the far turn, edged
to a narrow lead off of the turn, shook clear of SWEET DUCK nearing the sixteenth marker and dug in gamely in the end to prevail. COCORITA bobbled at
the start and was off slowly, saved ground while settling in the early stages, improved position two wide on the second turn, rallied leaving the bend, was put
to steady urging through the final sixteenth and just missed for the win while getting the nod for second. LIVIN' AT THE BU was allowed to settle in the early
stages, was three wide along the first turn, loomed three wide on the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch but came back on to close well late and just
missed in the end for the win and place while clear of the rest for show. SWEET DUCK was three wide on the first turn while forwardly placed, made a
steady advance along the backstretch and through the second turn while three wide, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the
final stages. LOVELY LOLA tracked the early pace from the inside, lost position nearing the second turn, was steered three wide nearing the quarter
marker, mounted a mild stretch rally but needed more in the end. LOCHMARA settled just off of the early pace, was in tight and steadied while two wide on
the first turn, saved ground while in the midflight through the second turn and weakened in the drive. ARISTEIA was four wide on the first turn while just off
of the pace, gained ground approaching the half-mile marker, stayed in the four path on the far turn, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and tired late.
LEIGH ANN was five wide while just off of the pace on the first turn, maintained that wide trip through the backstretch run and along the far turn while never
far back, lost ground in upper stretch and did not mount a late response. KID IN THE FOREST lacked early speed into the first turn, lagged through the
backstretch run, began to bore out nearing the half-mile marker, was eased along the second turn and walked off under her own power. PRAY TO AN
ANGEL broke alertly and took command of the early pace, set prompted fractions into the backstretch run, lost action and was pulled up leaving the
half-mile marker and was vanned off.
