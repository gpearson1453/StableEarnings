CATS TOUCH stalked the pace, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole to challenge, raced to the inside of Valentine Diving in the stretch run and
edged clear late under strong pressure. VALENTINE DIVINE showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced off the inside and couldn't match strides
with the winner late to finish second best. CAPTAIN RED was off a step slow, raced four wide near the seven eighths pole, moved up five wide through the
upper stretch and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE stalked the early pace, raced near the inside around the far turn
through the stretch and had no response. ROYAL SEEKER was allowed to settle early on, raced towards the inside and never threatened.

HOYA PARANOYA showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced off the inside and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. SLAATS stalked
the pace, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch, closed the gap on the winner in the final stages and finished second best. TWO GUNS was slow
early on, raced five wide through the lane and moved up through the stretch drive. SEA SPLENDOR dropped back early on, raced widest through the lane
and never was a factor. NOT THAT SERIOUS was unhurried early, raced four wide through the far turn and had no response. HEY NOW was forwardly
placed to lay up close in the early stages and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
LINCHPIN STORM stalked the top pair early on, moved up along the inside near the quarter pole, continued to race near the inside in the drive held well to
prove best under strong encouragement. MORE HONOR was forwardly placed down the backstretch, was ridden along nearing the three eighths pole, was
five to six wide in the stretch run and got up for the place position late. CANDY WOMPUS settled off the early going, moved up five wide around the far turn
and moved up through the drive. MAJOR MUNNINGS pressed the pace, raced four wide through the upper lane and weakened a bit the final eighth of a
mile. EL CHUMELITO was unhurried early on, lost his whip near the quarter pole and made a mild late gain. PASSED BY PAUL settled off the early pace,
raced near the inside and had no late response. MOJAVE showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MS GLORY BEACH was bumped at the break, hustled along early, dueled with Wedding chapel and got up late in a determined run under all out pressure.
WEDDING CHAPEL dueled for the early lead from the inside of Ms Glory beach, was clear near the eighth pole but couldn't last to finish second best.
STOLEN HALO stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn, angled out through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. LADY M dropped back
early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and had no final winning bid. LET IT REIGN was bumped at the break, raced towards the
inside and had no response. BEAUTIFUL CALL dropped back off the early going, raced five to six wide through the upper lane and never was a factor. ONE
OCEAN was slow early and never threatened. GABRIELLA WHO was off slowly, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was a factor.
MISCHIEVOUS EMMA was hustled early, raced towards the inside through the lane and never was a factor.

Footnotes
PRINCE OTTO bobbled at the break, stalked the pace, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to be clear in the final stages
under steady handling. JEDIZEE vied for the early lead while racing between rivals and finished second best. LUGIA broke awkwardly, dropped back early,
raced five wide around the far turn and moved up through the stretch run. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY pressed the pace from the inside and weakened the
final eighth of a mile. ROADSIDE settled off the early going, raced four wide through the upper stretch and had no late response. ASSURANCE was off
slowly, raced two to three wide and never was a factor. ARDIE THE LEGEND dropped back early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no
response.
