Footnotes
FLASHY BIZ in the second flight inside, continued to save ground through the turn, tipped out a bit for the drive, challenged outside the leader inside the
furlong marker, fully extended to narrowly prevail while between horses at the wire. BEAUTY DAY back off the pace and the inside, came five wide for the
drive when moving closer, late bid outside the winner, closing the gap on the winner while too late. HOPING FOR A RING moved up after the start to duel
up the backstretch and into turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, responded when confronted by the winner with less than a
furlong remaining, proved stubborn to the end. SIMONA'S CHOICE void of speed, raced off the inside into the turn, fanned five wide into the lane, coming
late while outside the runner up. RED LINGERIE dueled up front off the inside, continued to duel through the turn, faltered in upper stretch. BEYOND
BROWN broke out, was straightened to race in the second group outside the winner for a half, had little left for the stretch run. LADY GUSTO last away,
trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
LOVING LUCKY void of early foot in trailing early, advanced into contention with a four wide move in the second turn, took over upper stretch, shook clear
under his own courage to win ridden out. PROUD UNION off a step slow, saved ground first turn, closer 2nd turn in the two path, steered out three wide
turning for home, finished willingly to be clear for the place, slowly gaining on the winner late. NUGGET OF GRACE four wide into the first turn when off the
pace, advanced three wide to put a head in front midway on the final turn, relinquished the lead to the winner soon after, could not contain the runner up,
comfortably saved the show. MAGIC ICE within striking distance off the inside and three wide first turn, continued to stalk the middle half, in the two path
through the final bend, lacked a closing punch in the drive. INDIA TIGER set or forced the pace in the two path for five furlongs and began to weaken.
ROYAL DE BE with the early pace inside after breaking with the leaders, continued to contest the pace backstretch, began to give way after a half. RAZOR
RAY remained back while off the inside. MORA five wide through much of the first turn, four wide through the second turn, backed up in the drive.

Footnotes
CATANIA lacked speed just off the inside, steered out to be four wide exiting the turn, shifted out widest for room nearing the furlong marker, finished
willingly to be edging clear late. KEWPIE DOLL bumped with TAKE CHARGE ERICA at the break to be last away, fanned five wide into the lane,
accelerated and took command with a furlong to run, could not match the winner late, clear for the place. KASSERINE PASS broke out a bit, stalked the
pace while wide, remained within striking distance through the turn, fell back off the top two when that pair rallied past the furlong marker, long grind for the
show, up for that position late. UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE pressed the issue off the inside, vied in the two path turn, showed the way into and through upper
stretch, headed by the runner up with a furlong run and gradually weakened losing the show spot in the final strides. TAKE CHARGE ERICA bumped with
the runner up at the break, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, faltered by late in the bend, continued to weaken stretch. SHI
O'SHI pulled for a half just off the inside and in the the second flight, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
GREATHEART stalked the pace while off the inside, three wide second turn, outside bid into the lane, edged clear late under firm handling. TIWANAKU
within striking distance along the inside, continued to save ground through the second bend, up late for the place while remaining inside, not a serious threat
to the winner in the waning strides. BEST BET bit restless in the gate, cleared up front through the first turn in the two path, continued to show the way the
middle half off the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner turning into the stretch then could not keep pace, caught late for the place. HELLMAN
bothered into the first turn three wide, continued in the three path into and through the second turn, lacked a closing response through the lane to finish up
evenly. STAND PROUD hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved out and raced four wide through the first turn, continued outside
and was once again four wide through the second bend, lacked a rally. CHROME RUN four wide when off the pace through the first turn, three wide second,
remained back. BIGTIME TEGRIDY got out when rank into the first turn, continued slow to settle onto the backstretch, finished after a half.

Footnotes
J'S LITTLE MAN off the pace outside, ranged up four wide turning for home, put a head in front entering the stretch, long drive to the wire, proved narrowly
best in game fashion. MR. COUGAR in mid pack early well out in the strip, loomed a threat five wide and outside the winner exiting the turn, dueled with that
same rival to the wire, outkicked in the late going. HOLDING PATTERN bothered to be off slowly, angled out six wide turning to the lane, rallied down the
middle of the strip to be in time for the show. BRASKA broke back, raced toward the short, steered five wide into the lane, staged a mild rally well wide to
improve position. SUPER GEEK went one paced just off the inside, angled three wide, split foes into the lane, prominent past the furlong marker then
flattened out in the run to the wire. BUMPER POOL broke a step slow, trailed well wide, 5-6w turn, improved position down the middle of the strip. SPIRIT
SOUL void of speed off the inside, in the two path through the turn, improved slightly through the lane without posing a serious threat.
ONEIGHTHUNDREDCASH in mid pack behind the pace toward the inside, same some ground in the turn, encountered some traffic late in the bend, came
up empty when clear for the drive. SOUTHERN PECAN dueled up front early closest to the inside, gave way after a half. LUCKY BREAK forwardly placed
three wide, bit closer late in the turn, was idling along into the lane when put in tight, steadied and fell back. NORTHERN WOODS veered in break, quickly
righted to duel up front off the inside, stopped after four furlongs.

Footnotes
SAPPHIRE ROYALTY sprinted well clear soon after the start, given a bit of a breather through the turn, shrugged off a rival entering the stretch, clear again
past the furlong marker, enough left late to hold off the runner up. NISI PRIUS in the second flight up the backstretch in the two path, stalled through the
turn, angled out three wide exiting the bend, steered out widest when straightened for home, was set down and finished fast to be rapidly getting to the
winner. STANLEY MARKET chased the winner up the backstretch off the inside, three wide into the turn, worked way to the rail by late in the turn, closest to
the winner past the furlong marker, had little for that one late, caught for the place. EPICUREAN lacked early foot, moved closer while four wide turning for
home, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. DARE ME hesitated at the break, raced well back for a half while three wide through the turn, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CAMARADERIE broke back, moved up to mid pack early, ranged up to brief try the winner four wide late in
the turn then gave way in the drive. ESSENTIAL BELLA tired while saving ground.

Footnotes
MALINTENT pressed the leader early, fell back off that one while three wide midway on the turn, roused, took over, held the runner up safe late.
LOOKINFOREXCITEMEN in mid pack while racing off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, finished willingly to be getting to the winner late, clearly
second best. WESLEYAN broke sharp, angled in while showing the way up the backstretch, shook clear in the turn, weakened when headed by the winner
with less than a furlong remaining, lasted for the show. DRAG MALIBU bothered at the break, off the pace while racing outside, three wide through the turn,
improved a bit with some mild late interest. ELUSIVE FREUD broke out to bother DRAG MALIBU, was straightened to race within striking distance, four
wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. GOBLIN off slowly, trailed well back for a half, four wide exiting the turn, improved position while finding
his best stride too late. SKYLINE lacked early foot, raced four wide through the turn, was not dangerous with an even run down the lane. MESMERIZED off
slow, moved up closer early, had little left for the stretch run. POPSTER forwardly placed for a half in the two path, gave way. PUBLIC RECORD remained
back while racing three wide. GLASSATO mid pack in the early going, staged a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
DINNER AT CRUMPIES dueled up front off the inside, showed the way through the final turn and into the lane, briefly headed past the furlong marker,
battled back to edge clear under firm handling. BIG SUCCESS void of speed toward the inside, began to advance far turn in the two path, steered out to be
three wide midway on that bend, roused into the lane, steered out a bit more with a furlong to run, closed with good energy to be in time for the place. TOPF
ROAD RULES within striking distance off the inside, closer three wide turning for home, put a head in front past the furlong marker, faltered soon after,
nipped for the place. BELLAMYS ROAN forwardly placed when in tight then steadied early first turn, continued to race behind the pace, four wide into the
lane, went evenly to the wire. SMOKIN BOOTS fell back to trail after the start, moved closer before a half, improved a bit in the two path into the lane, also
was going evenly at the end. MO BETTA in the second flight early just off the inside, saved ground through the second turn, lacked a closing response in
making little impact through the stretch. SMARTY GRIMES dueled up front inside the winner, gave way exiting the final turn. GHOST STRATEGY raced
three wide and failed to menace. TALE OF TRUTH steadied at the break then got out while rank into the first turn, trailed, finished far back.

Footnotes
KERSHAW unhurried early while three wide through the first turn, continued off the inside, in some traffic far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied to
kick down the leader late after being floated out a bit with a sixteenth to run. SPA CITY off the early pace and the inside, moved closer and took over before
a half, showed the way into the stretch, drifted out late, could not contain the winner. BOURBON FRONTIER within striking distance early, fell back the
middle half, came again late from between foes and proved game for the show, not a threat to the top two. FORT PECK forwardly placed off the inside,
prominent three wide in the run up the backstretch, crept up to challenge three wide turning for home, saw that progress stall nearing the furlong marker,
drifted out, outkicked for the show late. TRUCULENT broke on top, showed the way through the first turn just off the inside, continued to show the way far
turn, vied into the lane, faltered the final turn. LORD DRAGON five wide into the first turn, continued back and outside, four wide in the second turn, lacked a
rally. SHORTLIST off a step slow, was never close. CATDADDY four wide into the first turn, five wide through the second turn, trailed home well back.
