THIRD WHEEL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up with a
rush to prevail in the closing yards. CITY AT NIGHT stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths
marker but could not resist the winner late. NEXT JOURNEY was away alertly then dropped off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn,
angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly late. JOKER MATT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way after going five
furlongs. EXECUTIVE ACTION raced four-wide through both turns, settled off the leaders and gradually gave way. ABRAAJ MIRAGE was void of early
speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and failed to threaten. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

LA CASTIGLIONE stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off as a handy winner.
BIG STRETCH showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled further into the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished
well to gain the place. BIG ANDY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. SUGARY
was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MULLIGAN sprinted clear at once, saved ground
while setting the pace and weakened after going three-quarters. JUST GRACE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn,
weakened and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
GORDY'S RULES stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear.
KING PARKER sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch but could not hold the
winner safe through the final sixteenth. ROWDYROOSTER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with a late
bid. DEWEY was reserved just off the leaders from the inside and failed to gain in the drive. FINAL ROSE pressed the pace while racing three-wide and
gave way after going five furlongs. EL BORRACHO was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. LOOKIN FOR GOLD raced
four-wide through the first turn, settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MAD AT MONEY was void of
early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not menace. GREAT ULYSSES showed no early speed and was eased after going three
furlongs. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
