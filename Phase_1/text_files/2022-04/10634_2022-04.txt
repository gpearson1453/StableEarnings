Footnotes
BLAKE B. stalked the top pair from along the inside around the turn, tipped outside of them entering the lane, kicked past in upper stretch, and drew clear.
MAJESTIC TIGER stalked two wide, engaged the leader into the turn, inched closer to bid at the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage passing the
quarter pole while BLAKE B ranged up outside, got outkicked by that foe in upper stretch, and held place. CORKMAN trailed while saving ground around the
turn, improved inside of foes entering the lane, tipped off of the rail in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show in the final sixteenth. ROMAN EMPIRE
tracked from midpack, but was coaxed along to keep pace into the turn, took the bend in the three path, but lacked a response and made little impact.
ROAD TO SUCCESS cleared early on, set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure into the turn, met that foe's bid at the five sixteenths pole, but
weakened inside of that rival and another bidding foe after drifting out subtly entering the lane. IT'S MANDATORY was urged along in the three to four path
while off of the pace around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
GLORY ROAD tracked two wide into the turn, pursued the top pair under strong urging turning for home, shifted to the seven path and outside of those
rivals in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, gained an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. HAPPY FARM pressed the leader
from the outside while in the three to four path around the bend, got floated to the six path entering the lane while chasing his inner counterpart under a
stern drive, bid at the furlong grounds as an outer foe menaced as well, but was outkicked entering the final sixteenth. ARISTOCRATIC set the pace inside
of a pressing foe while a path or two off of the inner rail, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, subtly inching away from his outer competitor while
remaining well in hand through upper stretch, but was shaken up approaching the furlong grounds as that rival threatened again, but lacked a response and
faltered leaving that station. MOUNT TRAVERS tracked along the inside, gradually shifted to the four path turning for home, but failed to menace.
REJECTED AGAIN trailed in the two path, shifted to the five path approaching the lane, and failed to factor. UNO race off of the pace three wide, but was
through at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
MUSICAL AMERICA dictated terms via a loose advantage in the two path around the turn, widened his margin when set down entering the lane, but
shortened stride approaching the final sixteenth as an outer FLOWERS FOR LISA crept closer, and lasted to the wire. FLOWERS FOR LISA stalked
outside of the clear leader from the three path, chased from the four path through upper stretch, grinded away on the leader's advantage through the final
furlong as that rival tired, but failed to reel him in. BLOOD MOON saved ground off of the pace, claimed show from outer rivals at the three sixteenths pole,
and stayed on but failed to threaten the top two. EVEN THUNDER raced off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. PLAYWRIGHT trailed in the three
path around the turn and was outrun. MAGNETRON tracked the leader from the four path around the turn, but weakened in the six path in upper stretch.

BIG AGENDA saved ground in midpack, improved inside of foes to secure stalking position into the far turn, rallied inside of GRAND JOURNEY turning for
home while shifting off of the rail, bid for the lead along with that rival at the three sixteenths pole, led narrowly approaching the furlong grounds, and gamely
fended off his outer counterpart through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead. GRAND JOURNEY stalked along the inside, before shifting out down
the backstretch, pursued the clear leader three wide around the far turn, rallied turning for home to bid for the lead along with an inner BIG AGENDA, dueled
with that foe through the final furlong while not quite reaching his throatlatch, and was denied. SUMMER TO REMEMBER prompted the pace two wide,
drew clear at the six furlong pole, opened up a margin soon after, maintained that advantage around the far turn, but met a pair of bids entering the lane,
and yielded at the furlong grounds. AMERICAN LINCOLN set the pace early on while inside of a rival, jump and briefly lost action at the three quarter pole
allowing that foe to clear, stalked down the backstretch, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with those rivals
entering the lane, but kept on to hold a minor placing. PRIORITIZE trailed, took the far turn in the two to three path, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and
stayed on through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead. DESOLATOR laid off of the pace two wide around the turns, tipped three wide in upper
stretch, but failed to menace. F F ROCKET saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. HIEROGLYPHICS was void of early speed three wide early on,
then tucked into the far turn, but failed to factor. SMILE BRYAN rushed after breaking a bit outwardly at the start to achieve a two wide tracking position
leaving the first turn, but was through after a half mile, and eased through the lane before walking off.

Footnotes
ADVERSITY set the pace from a bit off of the rail while encountering outer pressure, inched clear of those chasing foes approaching midstretch, and held
sway through the final furlong. THINKING IT OVER prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but was surpassed by his outer competitor for place
at the quarter pole, sustained his chase thereafter, and kept on to reclaim place in the closing stages. CAPTIVATING CARA brushed an inner foe at the
start, tracked behind the leading trio from the two path, shifted outside of them in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses. BANKERS DAUGHTER
stalked three wide, chased the leader through the lane after claiming place, but faltered in the final sixteenth. TRUE EMPRESS raced off of the pace two
wide and between horses, shot to the five path at the three furlong pole after her outer rival gave way, rallied outside of foes through midstretch, but leveled
off in the final sixteenth. FANCY FELINE saved ground off of the pace, shifted a bit off of the rail in upper stretch, and stayed on while one-paced. KNOW IT
ALL AUDREY broke slowly, tracked in midpack in the three path around the turn, but weakened entering the lane. MOAM bumped with an inner rival before
being brushed by an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace three wide while under coaxing into the turn, came under very heavy urging turning for
home, but failed to factor. PONCHO SONG trailed in the two path and never got involved. BLAME IT ON MARY bobbled at the start while breaking with the
field, tracked four wide, but weakened entering the lane before being eased in upper stretch. SALSA A PARTE bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced
far back in the three path, and was outrun.

SNOW LOVES A FIGHT tracked from midpack along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path, swung outside of the leaders and to the six path
entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, kicked clear shortly after, and lasted from an outer on-charging rival in the late stages. GATHER THE
FACTS tracked outside of the eventual winner early on, took the turn in the two path, rated behind rivals turning for home, shifted out to the six path in upper
stretch, rallied with a good kick in the final furlong in pursuit of the clear leader, but was too late to reel that rival in. WITH BELLS ON stalked along the,
tipped outside of the leader and to the three path at the five sixteenths pole to bid entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong
grounds, then lost place while shifting inwardly in the final sixteenth. MOSTLY HARMLESS settled far back two wide while under a snug hold, tucked to the
rail into the turn, saved ground, improved inside of rivals entering the lane, committed to a rail charge in upper stretch, but only managed to chase mildly
before shying and checking from an outer foe late. DAME TIME set the pace in the two path, drew clear at the three furlong pole, resisted WITH BELLS
ON's bid entering the lane, but yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. BROADWAY BOOGIE pressed the leader from the outside while in the three
path, but faded at the three furlong pole. DOLCE SERA broke slowly, raced far back in the two path, and never got involved. BIG BEE tracked in the four
path, but faded in the five path entering the lane. NOT SO GRIMM broke slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, but was eased around the turn, galloped
through the wire with an uncomfortable stride, then was vanned off after leaving the turf gap. THE RIDER OF MOSTLY HARMLESS CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF WITH BELLS ON FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISSALLOWED BY THE
STEWARDS.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN DISTRICT laid off of the pace, tracked intently while well in hand in the four path around the turn, ranged up without rider encouragement
turning for home to bid at the quarter pole, then kicked away in upper stretch, and held sway from a chasing rival through the final furlong. THE REDS broke
a beat slowly, tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring SIBELIUS at the seven sixteenths pole causing him to trail the field passing the
five sixteenths marker, knifed through rivals while shifting to the five path entering the lane, delayed his lead change to the furlong grounds while in pursuit
of the clear leader, and chased then foe home evenly. MARKET ALERT broke sharply, dueled for the lead two wide, inherited an advantage into the turn
when his inner counterpart yielded, but was outkicked by an outer bidding foe in upper stretch, and ran on to maintain show. TIERGAN took back from
crowded quarters among foes soon after the start, shifted out and rushed outside of rivals to a four wide tracking position, pressed the leading pair at the
half mile pole, inched closer under a drive turning for home as an outer SOUTHERN DISTRICT ranged up alongside, but was outkicked by that foe at the
quarter pole, and faded on his left lead in upper stretch. WAXMAN stalked three wide, tracked between horses from the three path around the turn, got
floated to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally. SIBELIUS dueled for the lead along the inside early on, but yielded at the half mile pole, chased
along the inside around the turn, but tired through the lane. HARVARD trailed while under urging in the five path around the turn, got fanned to the seven
path entering the lane, and weakened.

SARATOGA FLASH vied two wide, gained an advantage from his inner counterpart in upper stretch, and edged clear leaving the furlong grounds. RALLY
SQUIRREL set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got headed in upper stretch, and proved second best. TIMBUKTU bumped with an inner rival at the
start, tracked from midpack along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, nudged an outer rival while shifting off a rival's heels to the four path
entering the lane, stayed on between horses, and prevailed for show. MR BREADWINNER tracked from midpack three to two wide, dropped back before
tucking to the rail at the three furlong pole, then tipped two wide and between rivals in midstretch, and moved up. LORD FLINTSHIRE settled off of the pace
in the two path, moved forward between horses turning for home, but was held up behind rivals at the quarter pole, shifted to the six path in upper stretch,
where he again encountered traffic problems, then got clear in midstretch, but lacked a rally. SALUTE TO AMERICA raced under a snug hold two wide and
between horses while tracking the pace around the first turn, shifted out to the four path entering the backstretch, tracked from the three path around the far
turn, but was nudged to the five path by an inner foe entering the lane, and tired. SANDRO THE GREAT bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked
along the inside, chased the top pair while managing show through midstretch, but faltered a sixteenth from home. AMEDEUS MUSIC broke a step slowly at
the start, trailed the field, fanned from the three path to the seven path entering the lane, but made little impact. UMBRIA stalked the top pair from the three
path, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SCUTTLEBUZZ broke a beat slowly, recovered to race in midpack two wide, took the turn in three path before shifting five wide entering the lane, rallied to
bid at the furlong grounds, shifted inwardly while gaining an advantage, edged clear in the final sixteenth, and held safely from an outer rival late.
THERAPIST laid off of the pace two wide, took the turn in the three path, pursued the leading group while gradually shifting six wide in midstretch, and
produced a good kick to reach place in the closing stages while gaining on the leader. AMERICAN MONARCH tracked from midpack in the two path, shifted
outside of the leading trio entering the lane while inside of SCUTTLEBUZZ, produced a bid for the lead along with that foe at the furlong grounds, but was
herded inwardly shortly after while vying, got outkicked entering the final sixteenth, and lost place late. PROVEN STRATEGIES set the pace while being
hounded by a pair of outer challengers, shook clear of those rivals in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a pair of foes at the furlong grounds, and gave
way. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with the pace setter in upper stretch before
fading. MILTON THE MONSTER pressed three wide around the turn, but chased the leader in upper stretch, got outkicked by outer rivals approaching the
furlong pole, and tired. BIG PACKAGE broke a step slowly, raced far back three wide, took the turn in the three to four path, but made little impact.
MAJESTIC DUNHILL was off a bit slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, then two wide around the turn, and failed to factor. PENALTY laid off of the
pace along the inside, took the bend in the two to three path, and never got involved. SNAPPER SINCLAIR raced in midpack along the inside, but steadily
faded around the turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
TAP'N DE BANK set the pace inside of a prompting rival, shook clear of that foe entering the lane, and held on from a rallying rival in the late stages.
SINFUL DANCER stalked along the inside, gained place at the furlong grounds, shifted outside of the leader to take aim soon after, rallied and produced a
late bid, but came up short. TWO FOR CHARGING settled far back in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show.
OUSTER broke through the gate pre-race, but was re-loaded with out further incident, stalked the top pair from the outside, but faded in upper stretch.
MAJORITY PARTNER prompted the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace entering the land, and yielded. PATRICK THE GREAT broke a bit
slowly, raced far back in the two path, and failed to factor. KAZ SUGAR BANK tracked in midpack two wide, but steadily faded in the five path around the
turn. GEORGE'S GAMBIT trailed in the two to three path, and got outrun. BASIS RISK saved ground in midpack, but tired through the lane.
