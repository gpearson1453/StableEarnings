to turn, no match held place spot. ANEJO well placed never far back, in a drive through turn, missed 2nd. INCORRIGIBLE alert from the gate inside, dueled
to far turn, wilted stretch. CRYO raced evenly with no late response when needed in stretch. GUN RUSH off rail close up to far turn, faded between horses
in stretch. BUGLE BARRY never prominent. POLAR WIND never factored. CELERITY never a menace. COUNTER OFFER failed to menace. EL AHIJADO

Footnotes
TIZ THE BOMB confidently handled four wide down the backside, bold move to far turn in hand, came three wide into the stretch run under pressure and
roused in the final furlong to go well clear in impressive fashion to the wire. TAWNY PORT good position to the half, three wide bid, pressed pace while no
match for the winner while best of the rest today. RICH STRIKE no speed to far turn, rallied inside through the stretch steadily for the show spot while no
match for the top pair. DOWAGIAC CHIEF sent up to lead first turn, led to far turn, could not go on and faded in the stretch. ROYAL SPIRIT never far back
to far turn, widest into the stretch with no gain. CABO SPIRIT between horses to the half, rallied out of far turn, no late bid. STOLEN BASE unhurried early,
steady run to far turn, nothing left str. RED RUN never menaced. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER widest run into the first turn, never factored. SWING SHIFT
three wide run to the half, gave way readily dropped far back. GREAT ESCAPE tracked inside to the half, stopped readily. OPTIGOGO far back early, pulled
up in distress, vanned off.
