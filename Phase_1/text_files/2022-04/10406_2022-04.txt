Footnotes
JOEY'S VALENTINE broke to the inside and soon moved off to a commanding lead, carried that lead to upper stretch and was under steady hand unging in
the lane to hold well clear. PICKLES N ME saved ground and slowly closed the gap but could not get to the winner in the lane. P R WHY NOT moved three
wide to get nearest the top pair but could not threaten in the lane. REPORT TO DUTY was crowded into the rail and shuffled back at the break then failed to
threaten four wide. PETE AND REPETE broke into the side of the gate to get away last and was always back. J TRAIN was not a factor. CREEDS
REVENGE gave chase three wide through the opening quarter and tired.

REALLY SLOW saved ground back off the pace for a half mile, reeled in the leader while angling out through the far turn to bid and go clear into the lane
then drew off under steady handling. MY BOY GUS moved off the a clear lead along the inside, offered little resistance to the winner nearing the lane but
held clear for the place. NEXTPORTOFCALL saved ground, angled three wide in the far turn and could not close on the top pair in the lane. PRAIRIE
SQUALL saved ground and failed to mount a rally. UNCLE TAP was not a factor. WAGER NO MO chased the early leader two to three wide and tired.
PACK'N IRON was always back.

DANCE KINGDOM rsaved ground bacik off the early pace, moved up going to the far turn while angling out in that bend, rallied five wide into the lane and
went clear under steady handling. FERRARI ROAD moved to the front and made all the running about the two or three path, could not handle the winner in
the lane but held clear for the place. HOLIDAY MAN stalked the pace inside, bid two wide through the far turn but could not sustain the move. PANIC
BUTTON moved up three wide while not a late threat. JENNA'S GUN RUNNER saved ground and failed to make a solid bid. PODEROSO EQUS stalked
the pace from three wide and weakened. HE HAD A SECRET followed the pace three wide and weakened. DREAM BABY DREAM tired racing four to five

THE BIG SHOW gained a short lead inside and made all the pace then drew off in the lane while under a stiff hand ride. LIBERTARIAN moved up inside to
take aim at the winner through the far turn, angled out for the drive and could not go with that one. DAAHER'S SUCCESS moved up two and three wide
through the far turn but could not close the gap in the lane. FAYETTE WARRIOR stalked the pace three wide and lacked a final closing bid. COWORKER
stalked the pace four wide and weakened. ON THE BRIDGE was always back. GUNSLINGERS LEGACY forced the pace outside the winner to the far turn
and tired.

Footnotes
ZYXYZ stalked the leaders from along the inside, found room along the rail turning for home to bid and edged clear under steady handling. GOODY TWO
SIOUX showed the most early speed to gain inside position while pressed by LOVEAFLYIN, was challenged through the far turn then could not go with the
winner in the lane. KILBARRY LADY was along the inside, angled through the far turn to bid four wide into the lane but could not get to the top pair.
ISABELLE'S JOY stalked the early leaders three or four wide to bid into the far turn and could not sustain the run. DIXIE DELTA moved up three wide while
not a threat. JAGGED ARROW broke in the air to get away slowly, followed the pace four wide and weakened. CABO DORADO was not a threat two and
three wide. SHELLPHONE was always back. LOVESAFLYIN prompted the pace outside GOODY TWO SIOUX and tired.

Footnotes
ITS A WRAP quickly moved up outside rivals soon after the break to claim the lead and move inside through the first turn, moved off to a commanding lead
and made all the running to hold the margin while kept to task in the lane. WARRIOR'S MAP shifted out leaving the second turn to move up three wide, got
nearest the winner but could not threaten the final quarter mile. HOLD TIGHT settled off the pace three and four wide, moved up in the far turn, angled in
entering the lane and made a bid at second that fell short. ST. LOUIE GUY was always back racing four wide and tired through the far turn. GOOSE
DRANK WINE followed the pace three wide and gave way. GUINESSEY chased the winner early two or three wide and gave way going to the far turn.

Footnotes
COWBOY DON stalked the pace three wide, moved inside through the far turn then angled outside the leader into the lane and wore that one down to
prevail by the narrowest of margins. BIG BIZ was on the pace along the inside, brought a clear lead into the lane but was caught in the closing jump. GONE
PREACHIN rallied along the inside to gain third while no threat to the top pair. BIG HEARTED FACTOR saved ground and lacked a solid closing bid. YANK
CRIME forced the pace outside BIG BIZ to the far turn and weakened. BROADWAY ICE failed to mount a bid three wide. MAXIMUS THE GREAT was not a
threat. MORO TRUMP reared at the break and was always back. FELON followed the pace inside and tired. CHERUBIM tired four wide.
