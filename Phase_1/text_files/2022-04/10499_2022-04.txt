LADY VALENTINA away alertly set a pressured pace through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch widening under a drive in the three path. ARCELOR
pressured the pace through the turn extending into upper stretch proving no match there while saving place in the two path. TICKETY BOO chased the pace
lying close through the turn racing four wide down the lane wavering a touch late giving an even finish. OUR FLIRTATION slow early raced five wide into
upper stretch picking up the rest there. BLUEGRASS CANDY was never involved. SOME WOULD SAY flashed early speed then faded on the turn.
