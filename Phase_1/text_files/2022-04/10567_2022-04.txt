SKYKAT was nearest the winner while two or three wide and could not close the gap while holding clear for her position. MISS OCEAN EXPRESS saved
ground and lacked a solid closing bid. STELLA MARIE bumped with a rival into the first turn while along the inside and lacked a rally. CHAMPAGNE BLING
chased the pace three wide to the far turn and weakened. MOONFIELD failed to threaten three and four wide. HOBBS HOPE was not a factor. MILLI
STARR bumped with a rival into the first turn and tired while three wide.

BACKCHATTER dueled inside a pair of rivals throughout, responded in the drive and edged clear late. GOT KRAMER dueled three deep on the lead then
could not go with the winner late. CANTWAITTOGRADUATE made a mild three wide rally to gain clear for the show. POVERTY FLATS was three and four
wide on the turn and lacked a solid closing bid. WOKE UP WILD dueled on the lead from between rivals and weakened in the lane. THREE BALL was not a
threat four wide. CALEBS TIGER was not a factor.

FOR REEL was four and five wide in the first turn while near the lead, stalked four wide to bid into the lane and edged clear late under steady handling. V.
R. FRIENDLYGARY was on the pace along the inside while pressed throughout then could not handle the winner in the lane. TOO MANY CAPTAINS
forced the pace three wide to upper stretch and came up empty late. CALEB ON THE GO saved ground in behind the pace to upper stretch, swung out
through midstretch but lacked the needed late rally. PAISANO JIM was squeezed back between rivals at the start, saved ground and failed to rally. LUCKY
LIQUOR SHOT was angled out in the first turn to be just off the leaders three or four wide and tired. LITTLEBIT DON trailed throughout.

PIERPONT showed the most speed to cross over and gain inside position, made all the running and held safe in the lane under steady handling.
CHUCKMATE was along the inside and slowly closed in the lane. KING OF ANYTHING stalked the pace three wide outside CHUCKMATER and could not
get past in the lane. HYPER DRIVE was three and four wide but could not threaten late. AMACE broke to the outside, saved ground and could not threaten.
WINGS UP was squeezed back at the start and failed to make a bid three and four wide. TICK TACK MO chased the winner early along the inside and tired.
GREEN CARD was always back.
