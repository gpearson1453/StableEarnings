Footnotes
MISS ALPHA BELLA broke very alertly, clear past the wire the first time inside, rated through some soft fractions, widened under a steady hand ride down
the lane to win ridden out. BEYOND THE HYPE dropped inside first turn, second flight, no match winner, clearly second best. BORN INTO BAD NEWS last
away, raced back and off the inside early, dropped to the rail 2nd turn, staged a mild rally to finish best of the others. MOONSHINE LILY carried four wide
into the first turn, continued outside in the three path, went one paced in lacking a closing response. T J'S FIRST three wide into the first turn, chased the
winner onto the backstretch, began a gradual fade just before a half. FINAL TABLE remained always back.

Footnotes
SPARKY HALE with the pace along the inside in the run up the backstretch, headed early turn, regained the advantage late in the bend, shook clear when
straightened for home, kept to task the final furlong while remaining clear. COLE SPUR stalked the three leaders well off the inside, came four wide for the
stretch run, could do little with the winner through the lane, saved the second spot late. TOTALIZER last to leave, trailed in the two path for a half, came
three wide for the drive, rallied widest through the stretch, slowly gaining for the second spot late. VODKA N WATER away best of all, vied up front while
between horses for four furlongs and began to weaken entering the stretch. CAN MAN DO with the pace while three wide, put a head in front early turn,
gave way entering the stretch, trailed home.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW CHARLIE with pace from the start, headed turn, regained into lane, drifted in slightly past the furlong marker to tighten up the runner up a bit,
drew clear, kept to task. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE moved up along the inside to vie in the run into the turn, put a head front late in the turn, slight brush, fell back
off the leader in upper stretch, in a bit tight with a furlong to run, shifted out a bit then proved no match for that same rival in the run to the wire after shifting
out, fully extended to preserve the runner up position late. COURTNEY FAY in tight at the start, steadied to be last away, continued back into the turn, came
four wide when beginning to advance in some traffic into the lane, angled in to split foes inside the furlong marker, finished willingly to be getting to the
runner up late. MISS DUTTON broke in to help tighten up COURTNEY FAY at the start, lacked speed in trailing for a half, steered out widest for the drive,
improved position down the middle of the strip. LORI'S EYES in the second flight while wide down the backstretch, five wide early in the turn, four wide
exiting, went flat late to lose a position at the wire. ALLELUIA ANGEL in mid pack while off the .inside, three wide midway on the turn, traffic late in the bend
while angling in, came up empty when clear the final furlong. STREET RIDE lacked speed off the inside, angled five wide when improving into the lane, also
flattened out in the final furlong. CATCH A WHIFF broke out to help tighten up COURTNEY FAY, was straightened to force the pace three wide, gave way
turning for home. BUCKLE BUNNY RED in the second flight well wide, four wide early in the turn, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
TOMA TODO prompted the leader for six furlongs off the inside, took over late in the final turn, drifted out a bit midstretch, turned back foe late in a
determined efforft. GREAT FACES settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the final turn, raced widest through the lane in also drifting out,
challenged outside the winner late, denied, remained clear for the place. ENGLANDER broke best of all, showed the way pace the wire the first time, clear
into the first turn, set a pressured pace the middle half, could not keep up with the winner nor contain the runner up, saved the show. TILLIS behind the pace
while racing just off the inside, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. EKATI'S VERVE saved ground most of the way to no avail.
WARTIME HERO within striking distance three wide, continued in the three path through the second turn, had little for the stretch run. SUN DADDY last
away, trailed four wide onto the backstretch, continued back to be always outrun. FRACTIONAL AND FINAL TIMES HANDTIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MAJOR CONTENDER forwardly placed while racing outside through the first turn, advanced and challenged in the three path and between rivals second
bend, dueled through upper stretch, slight drift, edging clear late under firm handling. UNCLE BERLEY closest to the leader in the two path, challenged
inside the winner while also between horses midway on the final turn, dueled upper stretch, light brush, proved stubborn to the end. GROUP EIGHTEEN
raced back off the pace well wide early, advanced and loomed a threat with a four wide bid outside the winner midway on the final bend, could not match the
top pair through the lane. LOYAL TO THE GAME behind the lead pack inside, steered out in the two path around a tiring rival midway on the final turn, went
evenly through the stretch. RED DEVIL void of speed off the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, improved only slightly in lacking a serious closing
respponse. SEVEN FLAT off slowly, continued to be void of speed while moving outside, was five wide when moving a bit closer midway on the final turn,
lacked a closing late punch. ALYANAABI off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack early, was finished after a half. JIM AND JIM was never involved in
remaining back. WILDWOOD Z cleared early, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, stopped final turn.

SHACKS WAY vied up front while between horses up the backstretch, narrowly showed the way out of the turn along the inside, long duel, dug in late to
narrowly prevail in game fashion. BLAME GEORGE last to leave, moved out off the inside, worked way out to be five wide turning for home when advancing
on the leaders, bumped with BELFAST BOY entering the stretch, challenged outside the winner soon after, dueled to the wire, could not get by. BELFAST
BOY back off the pace, four wide when advancing late in the turn, bumped with the runner up exiting the bend, staged a mild rally to annex the show, no
threat to the top two. VIOLENT PASS with the pace three wide and between foes early, continued to battle through the turn, faltered in the drive. MEGATAP
was a pace factor for four furlongs on the outside, also backed up through the lane. DANCING COSSACK within striking distance in the early going, was
finished before a half.

TIGER MOON unhurried early, advanced through traffic second turn, came three wide into the lane, quickly took over approaching midstretch, clear, in hand
late, ridden out. DECLARE THE MOON off a step slow, moved out to race three wide through the first turn, continued outside, four to five wide late in the
second, rallied to finish willingly and earn the place, no threat to the winner. PUDGE BOY PALACE within striking distance while just off the inside,
continued to save some ground into the far turn, two path into the lane, finished up evenly to prove best of the rest, outkicked for the place. EL POTENTE
dueled up front early off the inside, clear before a half, continued to show the way into the far turn, faltered when headed by the winner in upper stretch.
MILLARD'S SMILE lacked speed, saved ground through the final turn, improved upper stretch, flattened out in the final furlong to finish up evenly. TREATY
dueled early closest to the inside, chased the leader the middle half, weakened for the drive. ICE BLAST four wide in the first turn, continued outside and
within striking distance, tired in the drive. LUNDBERG off a step slow, raced back, three out to four wide second turn, also grew weary down the lane.
DREAMER'S DELIGHT three wide first turn, gave way before six furlongs, finished well back.

GIMMICK took control before a furlong inside, larger lead through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, kept to pressure the final furlong to win
off. SHARED FUTURE void of speed off the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, rallied inside a pair of rivals to annex the place, no threat to the
winner. MASSARD in the second flight off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, no threat to the winner, outkkicked for the place. HARTLEY away in
good order, pressed the winner from the outside up the backstretch, continued to pursue that one through the turn then weakened steadily through the lane.
BIG JAVA off a step slow, remained back.

Footnotes
PINKY TOE broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch closest to the inside, continued to vie inside turn, briefly headed three sixteenths out, battled
back, extended stretch duel, proved narrowly best in game fashion. ARI OAKLEY pressed the winner up the backstretch in the two path, advanced and
dueled with that one through the turn and into the lane, briefly put a head in front upper stretch, dueled to the wire, denied. LITTLE MOMBO forwardly
placed outside, continued within striking distance three wide, proved no match for the top two late, fully extended to maintain the show. VIOLENT
HAILSTORM tracked the pace while off the inside, came three wide out of the turn, gaining for the show while too late after shifting out widest midstretch.
SAMMIES SAMURAI remained back while one paced off the inside. MONET behind the three leaders along the inside, tired in fading through the stretch.
SHEZAPISTOL off a step slow, moved out to be four wide into the turn, three wide into the lane, failed to rally. CUZ I CAN DARLING fell back to trail,
showed little while racing in the two path.
