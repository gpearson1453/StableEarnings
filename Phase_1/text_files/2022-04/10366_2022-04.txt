REINA DEL SUR showed good early speed while racing two wide down the backstretch through the stretch run and was well clear late under steady
pressure. SECRET AVENGER pressed the leader from the inside and was no match for the winner in the drive. HEY SISSY stalked the early pace, while
racing four wide down the backstretch and had not enough for the top pair in the stretch run. BLACK CHEETAH was unhurried early, raced three wide
through the lane and had no response. MOUNTAIN HEART settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and had no rally. RUN A
FIRE stalked the early pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and tired. CUTE BLONDE was slow in the early stages, raced three wide in the
lane and never threatened.

under steady handling. TWILITE LIASON was allowed to settle early on, moved up three to four wide in the lane, raced between rivals and made a good
late rally. BLUESKIESANDANGELS pressed the early leader down the backstretch, angled to five path through the stretch run and kept on to the wire.
BRASSY FIRE showed good early speed from the inside outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. THE HEAT IS ON dropped back early on, raced
six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. FROSTED PRAYER was unhurried early, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch
and never threatened. ROGUE BOY was slow early and never threatened.

THEYCALLHERPINKY was quick to begin to set the early pace from the inside, built a clear lead inside the eighth pole, dug in late and prevailed under
strong handling. LILLY BELLE stalked the early pace along the inside down the backstretch, continued to race near the inside through the far turn, shifted
out three to four wide and closed gamely to just miss. SWEET SMOKIN GAL was allowed to settle off the pace, raced three wide in the drive and moved up
to gain third place. ICY CAPE settled to the middle of the pack early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no rally. HUSHED was
forwardly placed early, raced four wide in the stretch run and weakened. SANDY CREST was slow early, raced four wide near the quarter pole, raced six
wide into the upper stretch, angled in and had no late response. ROCKIN RONI stalked the pace, raced five deep through the upper lane and failed to
sustain a bid. The half mile fractional time was unavailable.

UNBRIDLED GUY showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced well off the inside through the stretch run and prevailed under all out pressure. TIZ
STRONG stalked the early pace, raced wide through the stretch as Tiz Strong raced to the outside of Unbridled Guy and finished gamely to the wire. A
stewards inquiry was lodged to review the stretch run, as well as Tiz Strong jockey claimed objection against the winner for stretch interference and
stewards ruled no change. MAHOMEITE settled to the middle of the pack early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and moved up through the stretch
