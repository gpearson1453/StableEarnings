Footnotes
UPSIDE DOWN sent for speed, set the pace while saving ground around the turn, began to open up a bigger advantage under a hand ride in upper stretch,
was driven through midstretch while still racing inside, and kept on safe while back under a hand ride late. PRINCESS CONSUELA settled near the rear
inside, raced in the two to three path on the turn, dropped to the inside in upper stretch, proved no match for the leader but kept on well enough under a
drive to prove second best. TAP N TWINE chased the leading pair, saved ground well behind the leading pair around the turn, swung four wide into upper
stretch, and chased on evenly . NAUGHTYNAUGHTY tracked outside of and just behind UPSIDE DOWN along the back straight and two wide on the turn,
proved no match for the pacesetter into the lane, and weakened between horses from midstretch. HOODWINK hopped at the start and was slow into stride,
settled at the rear early, made a bid past the seven sixteenths while racing in the three to four path, was driven five wide into the lane and came up empty.
TIZ A QUEEN refused at the start, left the gate after some encouragement from an assistant starter, unseated her rider a few steps out of the gate,
completed the course without a rider, was apprehended after the race and walked off.

Footnotes
CERTAIN HEARTS lugged out leaving the gate, was hustled to an early lead from there, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the
turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and maintained her margin to the wire under a drive. PALACE MAGIC chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the four path passing the three eighths pole, and continued to gain ground on the outside down the lane but was no match for
the winner. JOY ENAMORADA pressed the pace from the rail in the early going, raced in the three path around the turn, was in contention in upper stretch
when her rider lost the whip near the three sixteenths pole and finished evenly from there. SURE SHOT ANNIE tracked the frontrunners on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground while running in the middle of the pack around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. HARD LIKE
HOLLY chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. WHAT'S SO FUNNY raced
off the pace between horses in the opening stages, raced in contention while two wide around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. SHEZA HOOT
raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and weakened from there.

to a drive, rallied on the leader despite beginning to drift out, took the lead past the furlong mark and cleared off in the final sixteenth. IRISH MAJOR settled
two wide in the rear pair early, continued toward the rear down the back straight and in the two path on the far turn, began to move well near the five
sixteenth, swung out five wide into the lane, sustained his rally, and got up in time for place. BORA BORA prompted outside of WHEREWEGOIN through
the first turn, led near the three eighths, cleared from the eleven sixteenths, continued to set the pace along the fence on the far turn, went to a drive near
the quarter, was caught by IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT past the furlong pole, proved no match in the final sixteenth and was caught late for place. KREWE
CHIEF tracked in range three wide, chased on into upper stretch while still three wide, but flattened out in the final furlong. ROAR OF THE LION settled at
the inside of the rear flight, continued at the rear of the field down the backstretch, trailed in the four to five path around the turn, swung out near the middle
of the track in upper stretch, and drove past tiring horses. RENEGADE BOB tracked the leading pair between horses through the first turn and into the
backstretch, settled to the rear of the main group, chased in the three to four path around the far turn, came four wide into the lane, and proved empty.
WHEREWEGOIN set the pace while prompted by BORA BORA through the clubhouse turn, was headed at the three quarter pole, tracked the pace down
the back straight and between horses on the turn, and emptied out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
I DON'T KNOW MARGO led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and was kept
to task to the wire. RENDLAKE pressed the pace between horses in the early going, moved up to duel for the lead from the two path around the turn, could
not go with the winner in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in
the early going, saved ground around the turn, gained ground from the rail down the lane and was no match for the top two. BE MY BESTIE pressed the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled for the lead while racing three wide around the turn, folded with a furlong to go and tired from there. MISS
WINDY SLEW raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, began a mild bid approaching the
quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. FEATURED POWER hit the gate leaving it, dropped back to trail well behind the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, and made up some ground entering the stretch but was never a threat. DANCING BARBIE raced off the pace on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, ran out to the five path for the trip around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and tired on the outside from
there.

Footnotes
SENORA ROMA was placed on the lead and prompted by JETS A GINNIN early, cleared and continued to set the pace in the two path on the turn, and
remained comfortably clear under a mild hand ride. JETS A GINNIN prompted the pace outside of SENORA ROMA down the back straight, tracked in the
three path on the turn, chased under a drive in the lane and proved clearly second best. STOPSHOPPINGAMY chased inside of SHEZ STUCK UP early,
chased between that foe and JOLINA into the turn, chased in the five path around the bend, grazed with JOLINA into the lane, chased on while no match for
the leading pair and outfinished GIRL NAMED PATSY for show. GIRL NAMED PATSY settled at the rear, began to improve position in the two path on the
turn, was driven inside of JOLINA into the lane, chased on with interest in the lane despite proving no match for the leading pair, but flattened late and lost
the show. JOLINA was sent for speed but outsprinted by SENORA ROMA, tracked the leading pair early, chased in the four path on the turn inside of
STOPSHOPPINGAMY and SHEZ STUCK UP, grazed with STOPSHOPPINGAMY as she came into the lane between horses, and came up empty. SHEZ
STUCK UP chased outside of STOPSHOPPINGAMY early down the backstretch and three deep into the turn, was pushed along but nonetheless began to
weaken in the six path past the seven sixteenths, and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
D' YANK chased inside of LUCKY SHOT early, continued to chase in the three path on the turn, was taken five wide in upper stretch and chased with
interest, kicked into his best stride approaching the sixteenth pole, struck the lead near fifty yards out and won going away. LITTLE KANSAS settled near
the rear inside of MKAR THE FAST, saved ground around the turn, uncorked a smart inside rally into the lane, altered around a pair of horses midstretch,
and continued to rally for the place. TIGHTROPE was sent for pace and soon cleared, set the pace in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper
stretch, continued to carry a diminishing lead into the final sixteenth, but was headed near fifty yards out. LOST IN LIMBO chased the leading trio early,
continued to chase in the three path between horses into the turn, responded to take closer order when pushed along near the three eighths, was driven five
wide into the lane, chased the leading pair with interest down the lane but was outkicked in the final furlong while drifting out. CONCRETE GLORY tracked
the leader outside of GET HAMMERED down the backstretch, continued to track the leader while positioned three wide around the bend, proved no match
for TIGHTROPE into the lane, was driven between horses in upper stretch, drifted inward and flattened out gradually. GET HAMMERED tracked the leader
inside of CONCRETE GLORY, was outkicked by rallying foes while racing in the two path around the bend, came two wide into the lane, and flattened out
late. MKAR THE FAST settled near the rear outside of LITTLE KANSAS, chased in the five to six path on the turn, floated seven wide into the lane, went to
a drive in upper stretch, and could not find the needed kick in the lane. ROB THE RICH was fractious in the gate, broke slowly and awkwardly, trailed, was
driven in the three to four path on the turn, came four wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. LUCKY SHOT chased outside of D' YANK down the
backstretch, began to flatten in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide into the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
CRANKSHAFT tracked the leader in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a three wide bid passing the three eighths pole, wore down his rivals
on the outside down the stretch and pulled clear late. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving
ground around the turn, was caught with a furlong to go and chased the winner home from there. KING TITO chased the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. MAXIMILIANO chased the frontrunner on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outfinished in the final furlong. MANGO TREE hopped up and was slow leaving the gate,
trailed the field on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and passed tiring horses in the stretch while never threatening.
DRAMATIC KITTEN raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, and faded in the final
furlong while drifting out mildly to the wire. YALIKEANYTHING trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, raced at the back of the pack in the two path
around the turn and offered no bid while drifting out in late stretch. SKIP THE SMALLTALK raced off the pace up the backstretch, came around the turn in
the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there.
