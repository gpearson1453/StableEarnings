Footnotes
BUBBLES IS ON FIRE settled three wide off of the early pace, swung widest into the drive, mounted a long rally through the stretch and was up just in time
to nail the runner-up for the win. UNION BOY broke alertly, contested the early pace to the turn as part of a trio vying for the lead, extended the lead along
the turn, kicked clear nearing the furlong grounds, was tiring in the final sixteenth, was nailed on the wire for the win and was reported to have bled when
pulled up. OMAHA RUTSCH pressed the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the late stages, while clear of the rest for
third. STING LIKE A BEE chased the pace three wide on the turn and lacked a late bid in the stretch run. LOVE THAT KID was away a bit slowly and did not
have early speed, was steered three wide along the turn and showed good late interest while unable to impact the top three. DANNY'S IRISH BOY broke in
at the start, was hustled into early contention, was forwardly placed along the turn while saving ground, lost position in upper stretch and faded in the final
stages. UNCLE DANNY lacked early speed and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
BREAKING THE CODE was away alertly, pressed the pace through the turn, advanced to come to even terms with SIMPLY PERFECT at the head of the
stretch, overtook that foe nearing the furlong marker and edged clear in the final stages. SIMPLY PERFECT was hustled leaving the break, set contested
early fractions through the turn, was confronted and overtaken by BREAKING THE CODE nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished in the late going,
while besting the rest. MOMMY ROSE stalked the pace three wide through the turn, was outfinished in the stretch run but kept on to get up for third in the
end. MIA SOLINA stalked the pace two wide between foes, was outkicked in the stretch run and was just edged out for the show. JUMPING JILL FLASH
broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace and did not offer a late rally. PULPIT SINGER stalked the pace from an inside position
through the turn and tired in the final stages. GEE STREET chased the pace two wide through the turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
LA POPIS chased the quick early pace, steadily closed on the pacesetter leaving the turn, took command into the final furlong and pulled away in the end as
much the best. BEAUTYINTHEBEAST broke out at the start, was hustled early on to show speed through the turn, was clear in upper stretch, could not hold
off LA POPIS leaving the furlong marker and was no match for that one in the final stages but held safely for the place. HAYDEN'S ANGEL was off a bit
slowly, recovered on the turn to improve position, was outkicked in the stretch but kept on to be clear for third in the end. STORMY SIERRA was bumped at
the start, stalked the early pace three wide and weakened in the drive. NITE SALE was floated out at the start, chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn
and tired in the stretch run. CLIPPERVILE GIRL was a bit slow into stride early, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor.

MAYBE SOMETIME saved ground while settling off of the fast early pace, advanced in upper stretch and had a good late kick to prevail in the end.
AMANOFMYSTATURE vied with several rivals for the early lead, took a narrow edge into the turn while setting fast fractions, battled with
BOURBONWITHATWIST through the lane and was overtaken by the winner in the final sixteenth, while holding for second. BOURBONWITHATWIST
disputed the early pace, kept pressure on the pacesetter through the turn, was on terms with AMANOFMYSTATURE through the lane but hung in the late
going and was outfinished in the end, while holding for third. DRUMADOON broke out at the start, chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn, advanced in
upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages while just missing for the show. TIME IS GONE contested the early pace, steadied in tight traffic leaving
the half-mile marker, chased the pace two wide through the turn and lacked a final response in the stretch. PIVOTAL FEVER was part of an early vanguard
vying for the lead, took back to chase the pace through the turn three deep and weakened in the final stages. BLESSED BROTHER was away slowly,
lacked speed through the turn and was not a factor. NATIONWIDE PRIDE was outrun to the turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
CLASSIC DR AL broke alertly and was sent leaving the start, was a bit green while setting the early pace, carved out solid fractions through the turn,
extended the lead nearing the furlong marker, was put to firm encouragement and dug in in the late stages to prevail. SURFLINE attended to the early pace,
was given rein into the turn to press the leader to the quarter marker, lost ground leaving the bend, was outfinished by the winner in the final stages and just
held on for second. PIAZZETTA saved ground while chasing the solid early pace, improved position in upper stretch, closed in the final sixteenth and just
missed for second. BIG JOLT chased the pace two wide through the turn and was outkicked in the drive. GOVERNOR SPECIAL settled off of the early pace
while three wide and offered a mild late rally in the stretch run. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW ducked in at the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked early speed
while saving ground and did not mount a late rally. SOO BROOKLYN was pinched at the start, recovered to chase the early pace from a two wide path, lost
position in upper stretch and gave way in the late going.

LOAFERS BOY was allowed to settle, was roused three wide on the second turn, advanced in mid-stretch, surged in the final sixteenth and was up just in
time to prevail. GOVENOR'S PARTY bobbled a bit at the start, recovered to be forwardly placed early on, stalked the pace through the second turn from a
two wide path, tipped out leaving the bend, vied for the lead inside of the sixteenth marker and was just nipped on the wire by the fast oncoming winner,
while clear of the rest. SHOT OF A LIFETIME broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions while being prompted to the second turn, was
confronted by SEATTLE BOLD at the head of the lane, battled against that foe's bid through the stretch, was outfinished by the top pair in the final stages
and just held for third in the end. SEATTLE BOLD prompted the moderate pace, advanced on the leader nearing the quarter marker, vied for the lead in
upper stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth, while just missing for third. BLACK CASPIAN (IRE) was three deep on the first turn while stalking the
pace, stayed within aim on the second turn while three wide and lacked a late rally in the stretch. GALLANT WARREN saved ground while just off of the
early pace, lost position on the second turn while three wide and did not offer a late rally. SECRET CLUB was unhurried early on, saved ground through the
backstretch run, was steered four wide on the far turn and lacked a late response. SKY DINSKI settled just off of the pace, lost ground on the second turn
and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY HUSTLE broke sharply and showed good early speed while setting fast fractions, shook clear of a pressing rival in upper stretch and pulled away
in the end. IDIOT'S GOLD chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn, was asked for run five wide into the drive, was no match for the winner in the final
stages but rallied well to be clear for second in the end. KERRY GOLD chased the fast pace three wide on the turn, did not offer a final bid in the stretch but
was clear of the rest for third. MIKE DAD chased the fast pace three wide on the turn, steadied off of heels midway through the turn, lacked a late rally but
passed tiring foes in the stretch. SECOND NATURE pressed the fast pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
FRISCO KID was forwardly placed early on, lost ground on the turn and weakened in the final stages. MY LITTLE TAYLOR chased the pace three deep on
the turn and was empty in the stretch run. SLICK VAN DYKE hit the gate at the start and was away slowly, was void of early speed and was not a factor.
FINE SOFT MORNING was bothered at the start, chased the pace from an inside path and tired in the drive. MR. MISCHIEF was off a bit slowly, lacked
early speed and was never involved. MR. WILLPOWER hopped at the start, chased the fast pace two deep through the turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and gave out in the final stages.

Footnotes
PRESKITT was hustled leaving the start and attended to the fast early pace, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, overhauled FIRE
ESCAPE leaving the bend, took a clear lead into the final furlong, felt late pressure from the runner-up but lasted in the end under steady encouragement.
AUTISM INNOCENCE chased the pace from the midflight, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, continued
that run into the final sixteenth to close on PRESKITT but just missed for the win, while clear of the rest for second. CIELO DIAMANTE stalked the fast pace
from a two wide path, gained ground in upper stretch, was outkicked by the winner leaving the furlong grounds and was outfinished by the runner-up in the
end, while clear of the rest for third. SMILING THUNDER was off a bit slowly, lacked early speed, was steered three wide on the turn and closed willingly in
the late stages. HOT ROCKETTE saved ground while chasing the fast pace, advanced in upper stretch but could not sustain that bid and flattened out in the
final furlong. BONITA LEONA chased the pace four wide on the turn and lacked a late rally. JAYS ANGEL stalked the quick early pace three wide on the
turn and gave way in the drive. FIRE ESCAPE broke alertly and was sent to the front, showed good early speed while setting fast contested fractions, was
collared by the winner leaving the turn and faded in the late stages. TYCHE AWAITS YOU was shuffled at the start and off slowly, lacked early speed and
did not offer a late response.

IKIGAI was hustled leaving the break, prompted the pace into the turn, advanced on the pacesetter approaching the quarter marker, took a clear lead into
the final furlong and drew off in the end as much the best. UNION WAVE chased the fast early pace, improved position on the turn three wide, was no
match for the winner in the final furlong but rallied to be best of the rest. BLAZING JAMIE chased the fast pace four wide on the turn, finished evenly in the
late going but kept on to get up for third in the end. ROYAL JESTER broke alertly and was sent to the front, was prompted into the turn by the winner while
setting a fast opening fraction, was overtaken by IKIGAI leaving the quarter marker and gave way in the stretch run. UNION GIG broke out at the start and
was off a bit slowly, chased the pace three wide through the turn, was green through the stretch and passed tired rivals in the final furlong. IMPRESSIVE
CURLS chased the fast pace five wide through the turn and lacked a final bid in the drive. POLACCO tracked the fast pace three wide through the turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. A. P. PHAROAH bobbled at the start, lacked early speed, made a bit of an advance while four wide on
the turn but did not have a late response. LASSO SPECIAL was off slowly, lagged in the early stages while trailing and was not a factor. BRUIN MAGIC
chased the fast pace from the midflight while just off of the rail, improved position on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and stopped in the final stages.
