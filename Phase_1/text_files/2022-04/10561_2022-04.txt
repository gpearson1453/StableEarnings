RIGHT ON TIME dueled two to three wide, moved clear. WRECKING STORM tracked the dueling leaders in behind, moved out from three to four wide on
the turn, was second best. D C ALLIED FORCES was encouraged forward inside, dueled inside the winner, weakened. PERFECT ZEN broke a bit
awkwardly, was encouraged forward inside, came off the rail a bit late on the turn and in the stretch and was not a threat. RARE COIN raced outside a rival
going three to four wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. RED CHILE shifted in and was outpaced.

Footnotes
COWBOY COOL stalked the pace three wide, took over a narrow lead on the far turn, kicked clear and was kept to the task. MITHQAAL raced between
foes two wide early, advanced between rivals two wide turning for home, captured place but was no threat to the winner. CERNAN settled outside, travelled
three to four wide, improved position. DISCREET TIGER set the pace inside facing pressure, weakened. DIRT ROAD RED pressed from between runners
early, went two then three wide on the far turn, lacked the needed late kick. OFFENSIVE saved ground, failed to rally. TROOPER was not a factor racing at
the rear while off the inside.

Footnotes
LEMON DROP GOLD exchanged a bump at the start, stalked two to three wide, moved to the lead at the three-sixteenths, was clear in upper stretch and
held safe. PROOFSINTHEPUDDIN settled mid-pack inside early, came out four wide late on the far turn, was gaining but too late. TUTTA TERLINGUA
moved forward outside a foe two wide on the first turn, set the tempo up the backstretch, faced pressure to the far turn, was outkicked. FLAXY LADY settled
off the pace between rivals three wide early, moved out five wide on the far turn, gained mildly. MARKING TIME raced two wide off the leaders and went
evenly. OUR TIME TO SHINE was unhurried early shifting in to save ground, moved out two to three wide on the far turn, was never a threat. LINE CALL
exchanged a bump at the start, vied inside early, came up empty. AUTUMN TOUCH broke several lengths slowly, raced two to three wide and was not a
factor. BIKINI TIME bobbled at the break, raced outside four wide, faded.

Footnotes
PREMEDITATED LILY was urged clear soon after the start, set the pace racing off the rail, extended the margin under encouragement. SPICEY SECRET
was up close to the winner racing three to four wide, proved no match. CURL saved ground on or just off the rail and improved position. MAMACITA
CARTIER was up close outside, went four to six wide on the turn, had no late kick. LONG RANGER was forced to swing out eight wide coming out of the
turn, passed tired rivals. AXIS CHARM chased the leaders, floated seven wide out of the turn, failed to rally. D ORO LANE failed to threaten after going two
to three wide on the turn racing well back off the leaders. BLUSHING BABE went four to five wide, failed to threaten. ALSONO'S HUNTER raced near the
inside, appeared to be getting out a bit late on the turn and checked outside the furlong marker. TRAVELIN LADY raced three to four wide and was outrun.
