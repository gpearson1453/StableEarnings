Footnotes
BROKEN FINGER settled off of the early pace while saving ground, was roused three wide on the second turn, was put to firm left-handed encouragement
while gaining ground in upper stretch, responded in the final sixteenth to get by the runner-up and edged clear late. SLEEP OVER was sent for speed early
on, set moderate fractions while being prompted into the second turn, took a narrow lead into the furlong grounds, was overtaken by the winner leaving the
sixteenth marker and was outfinished in the end, while holding for second. HULA KING attended to the pace, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker,
was outkicked in the final sixteenth but was clear of the rest for third. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI saved all of the ground while stalking the pace and lacked a
late response. RICH WARRIOR stalked the pace from a three wide path, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. FOUR O'FIVE was
unhurried in the early stages, was asked for run on the second turn while four wide and was not a factor.

stretch to overtake the top pair and kicked clear in the final stages. BLUE BREEZE settled off of the early pace, mounted a three then four wide bid on the
second turn, was outkicked in the stretch by the winner but held safely late for second. STEIN'S GIRL was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into
the second turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker, lacked a late kick in the drive but kept on in the end to be clear for third. SHANGHAI MIST was
forwardly placed while stalking the early pace, gained ground three wide on the second turn and tired in the stretch run. KISS RIDE GOODBYE pressed the
moderate pace through the second turn, was overtaken by the winner nearing the furlong marker and weakened in the late going. SUNSET STAR was

Footnotes
A MAN'S MAN stalked the early pace three wide on the first turn, was given rein along the backstretch run to advance on the pacesetter, mounted a two
wide bid nearing the quarter marker, took command in upper stretch and held safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS
saved ground while sitting off of the early pace, was two wide between foes in traffic nearing the quarter marker, tipped out three wide for the drive, closed
well late and could not reel in the winner but was up in time to get the nod for second. SHOTGUN EXPRESS (IRE) stalked the pace, advanced on the
second turn while three wide, continued that gain in upper stretch, was outfinished in the final stages and was just edged out for third in the end. MYSTIC
TRAVELER was sent after an alert beginning and cleared the field into the first turn to set the pace, was prompted by the winner through the backstretch
run, could not hold off A MAN'S MAN nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the late stages. LOVE OF THE SPORT saved ground while unhurried
initially, was steered three wide on the far turn and lacked a late response. DOUBLE THE GOLD contested the early pace, took back to stalk the pace
through the backstretch run, made a bit of a gain nearing the quarter marker but could not sustain that bid and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
BLUE WILDCAT pressed the early pace through the turn, inched ahead to come on even terms with TROPICANA GIRL nearing the furlong marker, battled
with that foe through the final stages and gamely prevailed in a blanket finish. TIZ A TIGER broke out at the start, chased the pace outside of rivals on the
turn, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, closed well in the final stages and was just nipped on the wire for the win, while getting the nod for second.
TROPICANA GIRL was away in good order, showed good early speed through the turn while being pressed by the winner, met the bid of that foe leaving
the furlong marker, battled through the final stages and was tagged on the wire for the win and just edged for place. LION'S LAIR crowded TIZ A TIGER a
bit at the start, tracked the pace between rivals on the turn and lacked a late kick in the drive. CONFIDENCE BUILDER chased the pace from an inside
position, lost ground off of the turn and lacked a late rally. TEXAS CHARM was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
STARSHIP ENDEAVOR broke alertly and was sent to the front, was well handled while setting reasonably quick fractions, extended the lead in upper
stretch, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up but held safely in the end to win in a drive. LIAM'S SECRET was three wide while just off of the early pace
on the first turn, settled through the backstretch run, was roused four wide on the second turn, rallied leaving the bend and put mild pressure on the winner
in the final sixteenth but could not reel her in and bested the rest. BLUEGRASS SKY was unhurried in the early stages, was roused two wide along the
second turn, was no match for the top pair in the final furlong but closed in the late stages to secure third. DANCE LADY settled off of heels into the first turn
while close up, stalked the pace from a ground saving position through the second turn, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch and weakened in the
late going. TURA LURA was four wide while forwardly placed on the first turn, stalked the pace three wide into the second turn, lost ground nearing the
furlong marker and tired in the final stages. MAGGIE FITZGERALD was allowed to settle early on, saved ground through the backstretch run, was roused
while along the rail on the second turn and was not a factor. LAST INNING stalked the early pace, advanced on the backstretch run, lost ground two wide on
the second turn and faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL CREED was unhurried in the early going while just off of the rail, was roused two wide on the second turn, made a steady advance through the
stretch, overtook CREATIVE ROMANCE in the final sixteenth and made a late push to prevail. CREATIVE ROMANCE was four wide on the first turn while
forwardly placed, stalked the moderate fractions into the second turn, closed on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took a narrow edge into the final
furlong, was overtaken by IMPERIAL CREED in the final stages and was outfinished by that one, while besting the rest. BRITTLE AND YOO broke alertly
and set the moderate fractions while on a clear lead through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off
CREATIVE ROMANCE nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in the late stages, while clear of the rest for third. MIDNIGHT FLOWER was fractious in
the gate and was away a step slowly, was keen along the first turn and pulled to be forwardly placed, settled along the backstretch run, lost ground on the
second turn two wide and was empty for the drive. TIZ AN EDVENTURE saved ground while stalking the early pace, lost ground on the far turn and gave
way in the stretch run. ROSE PRINCESS took up at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled four wide off of the early pace on the first turn, was steered
three wide on the second turn and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
AMERICA GREAT broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions through the half-mile marker, withstood consistent pressure through the
second turn and upper stretch, took a narrow lead into the final sixteenth while all out and determinedly held on for the win. VANTAGE POINT prompted the
moderate pace, steadily closed on AMERICA GREAT nearing the quarter marker, came to even terms with that foe at the top of the lane, lost a bit of ground
in mid-stretch, came back on in the final stages and just missed for the win while holding for second in a blanket finish. HEAT N REHEAT was hard to load,
stalked the early pace three wide, was steered four wide on the second turn, closed in upper stretch, vied for the lead leaving the furlong marker, could not
get by VANTAGE POINT and AMERICA GREAT in the end and was just nipped for the win and place while clear of the rest for third. EAST RAND was off a
step slow, recovered to stalk the pace through the backstretch run, made a three wide bid into the stretch run, came within aim nearing the furlong grounds
but was outfinished in the final stages. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) was unhurried early on, was asked for run four wide on the second turn and did not mount
a late rally. DEALERS HAND saved ground while settling off of the early pace, shifted to the two path on the far turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
SLACK TIDE broke alertly and was sent to the front, showed good speed while setting the contested pace through the turn, shook free in upper stretch and
drew clear in the end. LOVELY COLLEEN broke in at the start and bothered ICONIC SKY and AMAAZA, saved ground while chasing the pace from the
rear, was roused leaving the turn, split foes leaving the furlong marker, closed in the final stages and was outkicked by the winner but was up in time to
secure the place. DULCE EMMA chased the quick early pace outside of rivals, advanced four wide nearing the quarter pole, was outfinished in the stretch
run and was just edged out for second in the final strides. MISS UNION chased the early pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker,
was outclosed in the final furlong and just missed for the minor awards. TAMARA MINE was hustled leaving the start and pressed the quick pace through
the turn, lost position leaving the turn and faded through the stretch. ICONIC SKY was bumped by LOVELY COLLEEN at the break and in a chain reaction
bothered AMAAZA leaving the start, chased the pace two wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. AMAAZA was bumped sharply at the start and
almost lost the rider, chased the quick pace from the inside through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING LOVELY COLLEEN, ICONIC SKY AND AMAAZA AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED
THAT LOVELY COLLEEN COST BOTH ICONIC SKY AND AMAAZA THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND DISQUALIFIED LOVELY
COLLEEN FROM SECOND AND PLACED SEVENTH.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN broke alertly and showed good early speed while setting contested fractions, lost the lead while two wide leaving the quarter marker,
re-rallied in upper stretch to overtake GOING TO SHABOOMS and kicked clear in the end. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN chased the early pace from the inside,
lost a bit of ground along the turn, improved position in upper stretch, angled out nearing the sixteenth marker, closed well in the late stages and was not
able to reel in the winner but edged clear for second. GOING TO SHABOOMS disputed the early pace, saved ground through the turn, took a narrow lead
between calls at the top of the lane, could not hold off the re-rally of TIGER QUEEN and was outfinished in the end, while holding for third. PERSUASIVE
LIPS tracked the early pace three deep to the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN chased the
pace three wide on the turn and lacked a late response. SEGURO was off a bit slowly, chased the pace from the rear while outside of rivals and was not a
factor.
