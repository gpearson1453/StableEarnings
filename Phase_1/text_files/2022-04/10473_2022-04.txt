Footnotes
HIGHER QUALITY broke out a step at the start, showed the way in hand three then two wide before tucking to the inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, had JESTER'S SONG get on near even terms near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then
edged clear under a drive kept to task. DIGITIZE struck the near side stall at the start then got bumped by PAPI ON ICE breaking inwards and was forced to
steady off the heels of HIGHER QUALITY conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide down the
backstretch before briefly tucking to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing three wide at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and rallied greenly on the wrong lead through the stretch while willingly securing the place honors. PROVEN HOPE grew a bit fractious in the gate
prior to the start, chased just off the inside early on before tucking inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened
in the late stages. JESTER'S SONG broke in at the start and was corrected under coaxing, raced four then three wide in closest aim of the leader before
advancing tucked to the two path through the turn, got on near even terms bidding three wide into upper stretch, then got shaken off straightened away and
weakened. PAPI ON ICE broke in at the start bumping DIGITIZE, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through
the turn getting placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
STREET CULTURE went to the front from the outside post, showed the way down the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn,
dictated terms through that bend, extended the advantage when shaken up in upper stretch, powered away under a brisk hand-ride into the final seventy
yards then was eased up while much the best. BARONE MARCHIS broke out and brushed the gate then was quickly corrected by the rider, raced just off
the pace while inside of the leader, was taken in hand while crowded when that foe passed in front at the five-eighths then tipped to the outside, dropped
from the three path to the two path early on the turn, chased the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. SIXTY THREE
S was hustled from the start, pressed then chased the pace, dropped back while in tight quarters against the rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and tired while clear for the show. ALARMING MISSION pressed then chased the pace, dropped
back while crowded between foes in the two path at the seven-sixteenths, moved to the three path later on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and
capitulated. BELL BOY was in taken under a strong hold while in tight between horses at the five-eighths then dropped back, leveled out around the
nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide under urging through the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. JOE GONZALEZ bumped
soundly with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, angled in about the five-eighths, went around the turn in the two path and failed to
threaten. RED JET bumped soundly with an opponent at the start and was off slow, raced at the rear under urging, went three to four wide on the turn and
was no factor.

THIN WHITE DUKE coaxed from the gate, was taken in hand off the heels of MICROSECOND into the first turn as that rival crossed directly in front, settled
tracking along the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and angled three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
steadily gaining through the final furlong to stack outside the top pair, seized command seventy yards from the finish and was under vigorous urging to inch
away late. STRAW INTO GOLD just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes inside the final furlong and fought on to the finish to just get the nod for the place honors. MICROSECOND
coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, dug in under threat from
a pair and was caught seventy yards from home while safe for the show honors. HUSH OF A STORM two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. GOOD OLD BOY saved ground near the rear of the field, came under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS just off the inside in pursuit
from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. JACK THE CAT just off
the inside at the the tail of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
PLUM ALI was taken in hand early, saved ground around the first turn, was rated at the back of the compact field, raced inside on the far turn, was asked at
the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, moved out under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, closed strongly to get the lead
inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) showed early speed, went around the first turn in the three path,
contested the pace on the outside through solid fractions, vied in the three path through the final turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, came under a
right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while just
able to get the place. FLOWER POINT was taken under a tight hold early, went two then three wide around the opening bend, was rated under strong
restraint while tugging at the bit, raced in three path on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the
leader into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and finished with good courage to just miss the place while clear for third. ALMS was hustled from
the gate, contested the pace while near the inside, was urged along on the far turn, dropped back under the crop in upper stretch and weakened.

CAN'T BUY LOVE broke out and bumped with a rival, moved in while establishing a good position just off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted
three wide into the stretch, was roused while staying inside the leader as that foe came outward around the three-sixteenths, gained to make a bid into the
final furlong, took a short lead in the final sixteenth, battled on even terms with the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong handling.
ATHWAAQ broke alertly then was hustled clear, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, came outward while put to a drive in upper stretch,
led determinedly into the final sixteenth then fought on gamely when headed by the winner and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. MINAUN
(IRE) settled on the inside under some restraint, saved ground around the turn, was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch then moved a bit further
out, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to just miss while able to get the show. HIGH OPINION settled at the rear of the field, saved
ground through the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. PRINCESS FAWZIA broke out then
was quickly corrected, was reserved off the pace, dropped back some around the nine-sixteenths, raced between foes in the two path early on the turn then
moved to the three path, came six wide into the stretch and gained some but missed the superfecta. MESSIDOR (IRE) was bumped at the start, settled on
the outside, was urged three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and was out-kicked. WEEKEND FUN tracked the
pace on the outside, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused between foes in the four path into upper stretch and came up empty.

AGGREGATION hustled from the gate, vied from the four path early on with a pair to his outside, eased off those rivals with five and a half furlongs to go to
settle just off the pace tipping behind the leader, tucked to the inside at the nine-sixteenths as the leader tucked to the two path, remained patiently waiting
in behind that rival through the turn until put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, seized command just inside the
three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. EMINENCY vied from the five path between foes early on before establishing sole command five
furlongs from home, tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths and showed the way through the turn getting let out spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, yielded the front just inside the three-sixteenths and dug in to hold safe for the place honors. MODERN MIDAS broke a beat slow and had his lane
taken over briefly by GOT THE GOLD, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, tipped out off the rail at the
seven-sixteenths to be three wide when put to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GOT THE
GOLD broke in at the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, until tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths, got floated four wide
nearing the midway point on the turn as MODERN MIDAS tipped out along his inside and got placed to coaxing at that juncture, angled six wide into upper
stretch and weakened. FLOWING RIVER vied from the six path outside a pair in the early stages, got shaken off a bit at the five furlong marker and tucked
to the two path with nine-sixteenths to run, chased in closest aim of through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into

Footnotes
HIGH TIDE stumbled at the start,, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, passed foes while
four wide on the final turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker and drew away under strong urging.
HILLIARD was taken in hand early, raced in the three path around the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went three wide on the far turn, passed the
three-sixteenths between horses with his head cocked to the inside, was asked for his best around the furlong marker and just got up for the place.
BRAZILLIONAIRE went to the front, dropped to the rail into the first turn, showed the way through solid fractions with some company to his outside, vied
inside on the far turn, shook clear while asked into upper stretch, lost the lead under a drive outside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner
then lost the place at the wire but earned the show. GREAT WORKOUT broke a step slow, was reserved on the inside, came under urging on the far turn,
swung four wide into upper stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response. BARLEEWON went around the first turn in the three path, was
well placed towards the front, stalked three wide around the far turn, was given his cue outside the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final furlong
and weakened. GINNSU WARRIOR brushed with a foe at the start, was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace on the inside, came under
encouragement inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back along the rail in upper stretch and had nothing left. SPECTATORLESS brushed with an opponent
at the start, was taken under a strong hold while showing speed, raced in the three then four path around the opening bend, prompted the pace on the
outside while into the bit, was asked in the two path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. LORD OF WAR went around the first turn in
the two path, settled between horses, dropped back in the two path around the final turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
THEODORA GRACE tracked the pace along the inside being taken lightly in hand intermittently behind the leader, remained patiently handled and spun just
off the inside into upper stretch, got roused once a seam opened and went for it in tandem with STELLA MARS having just enough room for the pair to
move into the seam briefly before THEGODDESSOFSNAKES began to close it down slightly, nudged STELLA MARS near the eighth pole winning the
seam and rallied on through to loosely split foes near the sixteenth marker before taking command seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish
kept to task. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive and ran on to secure the place honors in the final jumps to the finish. MISSING LINK showed the way in hand along the
inside through swift splits patiently handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a trio and was caught seventy
yards from home, then got nailed in the last jumps for the place honors. STELLA MARS just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, tucked inside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and angled in going for seam between the top pair straightened away in the two
path joining THEODORA GRACE in that seam, dug in and was nudged near the eighth pole briefly taking hold as THEGODDESSOFSNAKES came in
slightly from the outside now in behind that rival and tipped out a path, then kept on to secure the last major share clear of the rest. LADY OF THOROTON
broke a beat slow and chased along the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide into upper stretch and
kicked on belatedly to the finish. JASMINESQUE three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS broke through the gate prior to the start inspired by HIGHWAY QUEEN who broke through just
prior, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. HIGHWAY QUEEN broke through the
gate prior to the start and was reloaded, chased just off the inside from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths tipped three wide,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.

drive in the stretch and proved best under strong handling. BUSTIN TIMBERLAKE contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied along the rail while
still inside that opponent on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, dueled until near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the
place. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS brushed with a foe at the start, was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven six wide into
the stretch and finished willingly for the show. OUR MAN MIKE bumped with a rival after the start then dropped back, was urged along while well behind,
went three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and reached his best stride too late while improving position. BREW PUB brushed with a rival at
the start, was hard ridden off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. RUNNINGWSCISSORS chased the pace down the
