Footnotes
ENGLISH LAUGHTER showed good early speed to set the pace while racing between rivals down the backstretch, raced just off the inside in the stretch
run and held gamely to be clear late under steady handling. COUNTY COURT was off a step slow, settled off the early going, made a steady advance
through the far turn, raced four wide near the quarter pole and got up for the place position late. PICCADILLY BEAU stalked the early pace, raced four wide
near the seven eighths pole, moved up to challenge while racing four deep near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. IL FARAONE was
unhurried early on, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch, angled in through the stretch run and had not enough for the top trio. MIGHTY
GHOST was allowed to settle early raced three wide and had no late response. CANDY MY BOY was forwardly placed to lay up close early on and faded in
the drive.

SEA TRIDENT was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up between rivals passing the three eighths pole, raced along the inside near the quarter
pole through the stretch and proved best under steady handling. LAST INVESTMENT showed good early speed, raced two wide and couldn't match strides
with the winner late to finish second best. JACKSON STRONG was allowed to settle to the middle of the pack, raced five wide near the three sixteenths
pole and made a good late gain. THROWN FOR A LOUPE stalked the pace from the outside, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and had no final
winning bid. KING ANDRES was unhurried in the early stages, raced six deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. HE'S ON THE FLY was slow
early on, raced three deep and had no response. IBERICO pressed the early leader from the inside and gave way.

up for the place position in the final stages. GUNMAN showed good early speed to set the early pace and gave way grudgingly in the final stages. BILLY
YANK was unhurried early, raced four wide through the upper stretch and moved up to improve his position. OXBOW KID was allowed to settle off the early
pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide through the upper stretch and had no final bid. TEDDY'S HONOR was coaxed along

MILLER'S MAIDEN showed good early speed to set the early pace while racing in hand, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. JEAN V'S
LEGACY was unhurried early on, moved up four wide nearing the quarter pole, closed in on the winner late and just missed in a game effort. SHE FLED
THE SCENE raced in tight quarters in the early stages, angled out down the backstretch, raced three to four wide in the drive and kept on to the wire.
INDEPENDENCE LAW settled off the early going along the inside down the backstretch, waited near the three sixteenths pole, raced two deep and showed
late interest. KITTEN WITH A WHIP was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced near the inside and weakened. HOITY TOITY settled off the early
going, raced four deep and had no late rally. MO NORMAL failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
HAPPY RIDE pressed the early leader down the backstretch, raced two to three wide in the lane and edged clear late under strong pressure. ADIOS BABY
showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside and couldn't match strides with the winner late to finished second best. OPEN SKY was bumped at
the break, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough for the top pair. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL broke to the outside,
bumped Open Sky, stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced four deep into the upper lane and had no closing bid. ALL BIZZ was slow in the early
stages, raced five near the three sixteenths pole and had no response. PLAYALINDA raced towards the inside and never was a factor. SASSY CHARLEE
broke sharply to the outside, jockey lost his outside iron, regained his iron down the backstretch, raced wide and never threatened after the troubling break.
A stewards inquiry was lodged to review start and no action was taken.

Footnotes
MARV'S MAGIC was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. OUR STUIE
tracked the leader down the backstretch, challenged Berhanu near the eighth pole, raced two to three wide in the drive and couldn't hold off the winner late
to finish second best. BERHANU showed good early speed to set the early pace and weakened a bit in the final stages. UNLEVERAGED was slow early on,
made an advance towards the far turn, angled five wide through the upper stretch and moved up late. D'CRAZINESS settled off the early going, raced three
to four wide in the lane and had no late response. ED'S DOG stalked the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile while continuing to
race near the inside. YAK settled off the early going and failed to respond. MORE CHANCES dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper lane and
never threatened.

Footnotes
EXPECT TO BE READY was away alertly, tracked the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the turn, drew off in the lane under steady
handling and raced in hand in the final stages. SUMMER SWINGER stalked the early going, raced three to two wide in the drive and was no match for the
winner. VALIANT SPARK stalked the pace, was coaxed along near the three eighths pole, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final
winning bnid. RAHTID settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and moved up in the drive. LUNA AMARILLA was quick to begin
to set the pace from the inside and gave way. YABA DABA DIVA raced three to four wide in the stretch run and had no response. RISING FAITH was slow
early and failed to respond. MISS ENCISO dropped back early, raced five wide around the far turn and never was a factor. LA MAGNOLIA failed to sustain
a bid.

Footnotes
SASSY CAT showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in inside the eighth pole and held gamely to prove best under strong handling. BARREL
OF BLISS pressed the early leader, dropped back a bit near the eighth pole, came on again while racing between rivals and got up for the place position
late. BROADWAY PEGGY stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and kept on to the wire. SHERRY ORIENTAL
stalked the pace, raced four to five wide through the stretch run, came in near the sixteenth pole, forced rival to take up and kept on to the wire. GREGS
POSSE was allowed to settle early, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. SHES A THREAT settled off the early going,
experienced traffic just inside the eighth pole, angled out and had not enough. TOOLEGITTOQUIT was unhurried early on, raced between rivals in the
stretch, was bumped and took up sharply nearing the sixteenth pole. A stewards inquiry was lodged for review, also an objection from the the jockey of
Toolegittoquit filed interference in the stretch run against Sherry Oriental and stewards ruled disqualification of Sherry Oriental and placed seventh.
FABIOLA PRINCESS dropped back early, race widest through the lane and had no rally. SCOOP THERE IT IS stalked the pace from the outside and
weakened through the drive while racing six deep. DARN TOOTIN was slow early and never threatened.
