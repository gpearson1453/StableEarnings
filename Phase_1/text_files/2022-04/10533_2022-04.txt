Footnotes
MISS SAKAMOTO chased the runaway pacesetter while racing two wide between foes, closed outside and was up in the final strides. S. MUFFIN sprinted
clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, remained well clear past the sixteenth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging late and yielded in the
final strides. JEST ABOVE saved ground off the pace, tipped two wide in upper stretch and ran on for the show. FREDO chased the pace three wide and
was one-paced through the lane. SOUTHERN BREEZE saved ground as part of the chasing trio and lacked a closing bid. WARLORD CRUZAN played no
factor while racing two wide. SEAVER was off slow and trailed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

ZELENSKYY STRONG broke in putting a shoulder into KOHAKU, sped clear inside within the first few strides, and widened through the stretch on his left
lead while kept to pressure. KOHAKU received a bump from ZELENSKYY STRONG at the start, saved ground giving chase early, moved out three wide
turning for home, and ran on evenly to hold the place. AWESOME FLAY was no threat three wide. FREE SOUL bumped with COURAGEOUS COPPER
soon after the start, shifted out to the four-path approaching the stretch, and could not gain. PREACHER AMOS showed brief speed two wide, and tired.
PACHANGA LOCA was outrun near the inside. COURAGEOUS COPPER bumped with FREE SOUL shortly after the start, and dropped far back after a
quarter-mile.

Footnotes
SPRING THE BEAST dueled along the rail to upper stretch, shook clear leaving the three-sixteenths pole and widened under a drive. PACIFIC LEGEND
raced off the early pace two wide, angled three wide to bid near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane but stayed on to hold
second. FISHING FOR FUN was in range while racing three and four wide around the turn, lugged in under right-handed urging nearing the eighth pole and
weakened. GILLIGAN raced off the pace three and four wide, was shut off and forced to check near the eighth pole, angled out and just missed third. ACT
OF VALOR dueled outside of the winner to upper stretch, weakened and was angled in and not urged for about a sixteenth of a mile as the rider reacted to
the incident outside of them. FEDERAL EXCHANGE failed to menace while racing three wide. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM
THE RIDER OF GILLIGAN, FISHING FOR FUN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED FOURTH FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE
EIGHTH POLE.

ALIZEE was hard to handle and steadied midway on the turn, moved to the far outside after entering the stretch and kicked in to draw clear late. MAKE NO
MISTAKE settled in the middle of the field three wide, rallied between horses in deep stretch and was up at the wire for second. DAY'S HUMOR sped to the
front soon after the start, remained clear into the final furlong, then weakened. AMERICAN TAP chased the pacesetter from outside to the stretch, loomed a
threat to 70 yards out, but needed just a bit more. RED WIND pursued the leaders two wide for three-eighths of a mile, and faded in the stretch. I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT checked while unruly a few strides from the gate, and never got close. FILLMORE EAST was no factor three to four wide.

Footnotes
EAMONN raced off the pace four wide, angled in nearing the eighth pole, closed between foes and was up late. FREEDOM MATTERS set a pressured
pace along the rail around the first turn, in the two path around the far turn, drifted further out in upper stretch, fended off challengers to deep stretch but
could not withstand the winner in the final strides. OMAHA CITY pressed the pace two wide, fought outside of FREEDOM MATTERS to deep stretch and
was narrowly outfinished. NOBLE INDY stalked the pace from the rail and finished evenly to maintain a share. LARGENT tracked the pace three and four
wide, loomed outside of the pacesetters in midstretch but flattened out. ME AND MR. C was in range two wide, steadied late on the first turn, went five wide
around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. BOURBON WAR was outrun while racing two wide. JOURNEYMAN failed to menace while racing four and
five wide. SASH (GB) was bumped at the start, prompted the pace three wide and faded in the lane. VOODOO ZIP broke outwardly and bumped
THRESHOLD into SASH, raced off the pace three wide between foes while a bit keen early and never threatened. THRESHOLD was bumped between foes
at the start then pinched back soon after, raced three wide around the far turn, made progress inside around the far turn but lacked the needed closing bid.
FIGHTING FORCE played no factor while racing three and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
ALWAYS GAMBLING was unhurried early while saving ground, tipped two wide in upper stretch, closed strongly, seized command between foes near the
sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a drive. NEVER SATISFIED broke awkwardly, saved ground well back, angled four wide in upper stretch and rallied
outside. R GIRL'S WERTH IT settled off the duel in the clear three wide, bid outside of the pacesetters leaving the eighth pole while the rider juggled the
crop and was outkicked late. LIVING WATER dueled along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, was collared near the sixteenth pole and weakened inside.
BARONE CESCO was off a step and never a factor while racing three wide. MAGNILOQUENT dueled two wide to upper stretch and retreated. THIS RACE
WAS HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
AZTEC pressed LOVE MINISTER from the start, reached the front past the eighth-pole still on his left lead, and edged away while switching leads late.
HAMMER LANE broke slowly, saved ground to the turn, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, and was along for the place. LOVE MINISTER sped
to the front with an alert getaway, moved inside being pressed by AZTEC, could not hold that rival off leaving the furlong grounds and was overhauled for
the runner-up spot as well. AGARRAMESIPUEDES saved ground outrun early, and improved position through the stretch without threatening. KING
ALFREDO raced close up for a half-mile, and tired. ROYAL HARRY stayed in range three to four wide for a half, and tired. TRUSTING BOND was never
prominent. CHARGING AERO broke slowly and was through early. CONSTITUTIONALSONG broke slowly, and was outrun four wide. THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
