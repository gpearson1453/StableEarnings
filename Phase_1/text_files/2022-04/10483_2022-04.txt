Footnotes
PRICE FIXER broke out, quickly took the lead and ran well under a hand ride to win easier than appeared. CHARLEY BROWN away well and in, brushed
with foe but it meant nothing to his start, lugged out past the gap and proved no match for the winner while under hand ride late. HAY SHAKER fractious, off
slow and bumped at the start, lost path and right when getting momentum had to steady pass the gap, angled out and finished well under hand ride. THE
TRITON broke out and bumped rival at the start, minor steady midway and finished up evenly. JIM HARDIE came away clean, steady urged right handed
and lacked needed response. PARTY HOUNDS hit gate and came away slow, lugged out three paths midway and weakened under urging.

Footnotes
CORONA ROSE slight bobble at the start but came away running, lugged in early and won going away under a hand ride. SECRET SUCCESS away well,
drifted in under hand urging, and lugged in late in while being outkicked. VALIANT LIVY away well, lugged out early, in contention and shied away from
lugging in rival late. I LOVE THE EAGLE broke in and bumped rival at the start, lacked early quickness and lugged out steadily late. SANCTIMONY away
well and immediately ducked out five paths at the start, and continued to try and lug out the rest of the way while never being asked and never leveling.
SOMEWHERE OUT WEST slightly hopped and came away slow, bumped with outside rival at the start, pushed in by same foe early and took up. SASSY
SAPHIRE off bit slow, and spooked by drifting out rival, took up and lost all momentum and chance.
