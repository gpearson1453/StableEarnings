Footnotes
FREEDOM LASS took a bump from inside at the start but still came away quickly, chased three deep then moved up to apply pressure leaving the first turn,
continued alongside the leader around the far turn and into the lane, roused in upper stretch, and took a short lead with a furlong remaining and kicked clear
in the final sixteenth. SELF ISOLATION sped to the front while outside a rival then cleared into the first turn, took pressure from outside into the backstretch,
maintained a short lead into the lane, relinquished the lead to FREEDOM LASS at the eighth pole and stayed on to secure second. EVER SMART up close
inside the leader first time through the stretch then settled off that rival in a stalking position, remained inside to the stretch, put to right-handed urging in the
lane but lacked the needed late punch. POP POP'S DREAM tugged up on heels and had to steady on the first turn, continued to pull the rider a bit up the
backstretch, suffered a mild shuffle at the three-eighths pole, exited the far turn three wide and put in a mild late. JIBBER JABBER (IRE) took up early to
avoid getting shuffled, chased in a forward position between rivals, steadied off heels on the backstretch, steered out in upper stretch and could not rally.
DRAMATIZER checked off heels and became rank on the first turn, tracked from inside then came out into the stretch and needed to find more late. KLEEN
KARMA reserved in the early going, became rank and drifted out a bit on the first turn, went three deep into the second bend, came four wide into the
stretch and lacked further response. DOLLY MAY (IRE) bumped with outside rival leaving the gate, steered down to the inside near the back, angled out
widest and failed to menace. FAIRY CAKES (GB) pulled a bit while off the inside, stalked three deep to the stretch and weakened. VAROMA was off slow to
begin, trailed through the early stages, stayed off the rail then moved out further leaving the second bend, came five wide into the drive, failed to threaten
and was not persevered with late.

E Z PHARIS broke in and brushed rival, was the closet pursuer into and around the turn while two then three wide, drew alongside the runner-up at the
eighth pole and drove clear. COCKTAIL PRINCESS got brushed from outside at the start, set the pace a bit off the rail then two wide into the lane,
challenged by the winner at the eight pole, could not match strides late but was clearly second best. COSMO KATIE bobbled leaving the gate, chased along
the inside, lost ground around the turn and kept on to best the rest. PADDLE ON POLLY broke a step slow, chased three then two wide around the turn and
weakened. DADDY CLASSY DILL tracked four wide into the turn, moved to the three path around the bend and also weakened. COURT SNORT chased
two wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
GALLOVIE (GB) attended the pace three deep to the turn, challenged around the bend, took over past the quarter pole, shook free at the top of the lane
and drew off under right-handed urging and strong handling. DEL MAR DRAMA got bumped from outside soon after the start, raced a bit rank across the
dirt but did not lose any ground, chased near the inside through the turn, tipped out in the stretch and outkicked DANCING DANA for second. DANCING
DANA came in and bumped DEL MAR DRAMA soon after the start, stalked the top trio outside a rival, came three wide into the stretch and got edged for
the place honors. ON PURPOSE dueled for command from inside, vied along the rail with a pair of rivals through the bend, lost touch in upper stretch and
flattened in the final furlong. LITTLE RACHEL bobbled leaving the gate, trailed off the rail early, rounded the turn three wide, drifted in some in upper stretch
and never threatened. PISTACHIO PRINCESS dueled with ON PURPOSE to the turn, vied between runners around the bend and weakened in the drive.

BRICKYARD RIDE sped clear quickly to establish the front, showed the way two wide into the lane, drew away under a bit of mild hand urging in upper
stretch and held safely without ever being asked for his best. TIGRE DI SLUGO chased at the back while still in ranged, traveled two then three wide on the
turn, steered out in the lane and finished well while unable to threaten the winner. STRIKE THAT stalked off the rail, rounded the turn two then three wide
and lacked a bid. MILES AHEAD stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, took the turn three then four wide and weakened down the stretch.

Footnotes
FAST BUCK went up to vie for the lead inside a pair of rivals then dueled leaving the backstretch, cleared foe nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drew away in
upper stretch and remained strong under left-handed urging. JOHNNY PODRES got bumped between rivals at the start then again crossing the turn, moved
to the inside and settled off the pace, raced a bit off the rail into the lane, moved back to the fence in the drive and finished willingly to gain second.
CAERULEAN got bumped inward at the start, reserved off the rail early, moved to the inside on the turn, tipped out and came three wide into the stretch,
chased the winner through the final furlong and could not find more in deep stretch. RAGING WATERS was off slow to begin, trailed up the backstretch,
hugged the rail through the turn, moved out a bit but lacked room from upper to midstretch, angled down to the inside for a clear path in the final sixteenth
and kept on to earn minor award. MINISTER SHANE got forced in early, chased three deep near the back into the turn, angled out in the lane and and
summoned a mild response to improve position. REALLY BIG NEWS traveled in mid-pack, went three wide into the turn, angled out and exited the bend five
wide and failed to threaten. SMILING GOODBYE vied between foes early then chased the top pair into the backstretch, saved ground from the rail position
on the turn and weakened. GOOD VIBES ONLY vied three deep early then dueled outside the winner leaving the backstretch, lost touch with that rival
midway around the bend, chased two wide into the stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT SOMEWHERE stalked the top trio off the rail, went three then four
wide around the turn and faded. MOOSE MITCHELL bumped inner rival at the start then bumped with that one again crossing the dirt, traveled between
rivals off the pace, exited the turn two wide and was not a factor.

STILLETO BOY sped to the front in the two path early, took pressure on the backstretch, moved clear at the half-mile pole, led off the rail into the lane, felt
pressure from EXPRESS TRAIN again in upper stretch, then responded well to right-handed urging while drifting out a bit and inched away in the late
stages. EXPRESS TRAIN chased three wide around the first turn, moved up to apply pressure on the backstretch then lost touch at the half-mile pole,
asked at the seven-sixteenths pole, took aim from outside leaving the far turn, bid in upper stretch while drifting out and could not match strides with the
winner in the late stages. SPIELBERG went two wide into the first turn then angled out widest around the bend, rounded the far turn three then two wide
while losing ground, weakened in the lane but was able to secure the show. HOLDEN THE LUTE stalked close up early on the inside, lost ground leaving
the backstretch, dropped back around the far turn and came up empty.

backstretch and got put in a bit tight into the turn, remained inside to the stretch and failed to threaten. ADRIATIC bumped with inner rival at the start, went
up to challenge between rivals, could not keep up with the leader late on the turn and gave way. DISKO TRIBUTE raced three deep off the pace, went two
wide into the turn, moved out and entered the lane four wide, drifted out at the eighth pole and never responded to urging. QUINCEY raced wide up the
backstretch, angled down to the three path around the bend and had little left for the drive. EREBUS saved ground through the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
BLUE STRIPE (ARG) stalked along the inside, coaxed along nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, swung out behind a wall of rivals with a quarter of a mile left
to run, steered out further in the lane then got floated out further by MISS BIGLY and proved best in the end. MISS BIGLY stalked off the rail, bid four deep
at the quarter pole, took over into the stretch, drifted out through the lane and could not fend off the winner. VARDA was a bit rank leaving the gate then
climbed shortly after before settling into stride, went four wide through the first turn, five wide around the second bend and was along for the show. BYE
BYE BERTIE chased outside rivals into the first turn, attended the pace three deep up the backstretch, vied for command in the three path on the far turn,
led briefly past the quarter pole before being overtaken by MISS BIGLY exiting the bend and weakened to fourth. PARK AVENUE set the pace under
pressure from a pair of rivals to the outside, vied for command around the far turn, lost command with a quarter mile left to run and weakened down the
lane. LISETTE coaxed from the gate, moved off the rail into the first turn, settled near the back, angled in around the far turn and made no impact.
MIDNIGHT JAMBOREE went three wide into the first turn then steered out leaving the bend, continued wide through the second turn and failed to threaten.
BELLAMORE broke through the gate and had to be reloaded, traveled in mid-pack early on, coaxed around the far turn but failed to respond, eased in the
lane and walked off. SHARAPOVA up close in the two path early then applied pressure from between rivals, vied for command around the far turn and gave
way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BEYOND BRILLIANT was off alertly from outside, drifted out crossing over the dirt, cleared and steered to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch,
met the bid from the runner-up on the final turn, cleared in upper stretch and remained strong to the wire under urging. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS went four
wide into the stretch for the first time, stalked the leader in the two path, bid from outside around the far turn, lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong
and held the place. GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) showed early speed off the rail then steered inward and was rated along the inside, tipped two to three wide into
the stretch, moved out a bit further in the lane and finished willingly. GREGDAR bumped with outer rival at the start, pulled a bit early then settled in the two
path, raced outside a rival up the backstretch, came three to four wide into the stretch and could not rally. DICEY MO CHARA (GB) reserved in the early
going, trailed to the stretch, moved off the rail in the lane and never threatened. DEAN MARTINI bobbled and bumped leaving the gate, got shuffled
between runners shortly after then became a bit rank early while trying to rate, saved ground into the stretch and lacked further response. MAJESTIC
EAGLE got shuffled between foes early, went three wide around the clubhouse turn, sat off the pace up the backstretch, driven two wide into the lane and
made no impact.

Footnotes
AIR FORCE RED sped clear to take control, shifted out crossing the dirt, met the challenge from MUBTADAA at the top of the stretch and drew away under
right-handed urging. MUBTADAA came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, tracked off the rail then crept closer down the hill, got forced out crossing over
the dirt, challenged at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner and drifted in late while holding the place. MOTORIOUS (GB) got bumped and
lost path at the start, sat off the pace and went three wide into the turn, moved out and came six wide into the stretch, drifted inward in the lane then angled
out from behind MUBTADAA who drifted in late and kept on for the show. COALINGA ROAD got bumped from outside at the start, tracked off the rail then
two wide on the turn and could not rally. ONE FAST BRO traveled near the back of the pack, angled widest on the turn but lacked the needed late kick in
the final furlong. CLAYTON DELANEY was off a bit slow to begin, traveled along the inside then two wide on the turn, moved out in the lane and failed to
threaten. ADARE was off slow and lost path at the start, advanced between rivals then had the rider take hold while lacking room through the turn, tipped
out late on the turn and could not rally. STAR RACER stalked two wide into the turn, raced between runners and was forced out a bit by winner crossing
over to the dirt, then weakened down the stretch. MORAWETH was off slow to begin, got bothered by ADARE coming over early and angled out prior to the
turn, got forced out over the dirt crossing and came up empty in the drive. INDULGE away quickly and outward in the beginning then took a good stalking
position on the inside but weakened in the lane.
