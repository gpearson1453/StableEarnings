ALEXIS'S STORM showed speed outside COCKTAIL DREAMING through the opening quarter mile, asserted herself entering the stretch and drew off
under intermittent urging. COCKTAIL DREAMING bumped with SHE'S SO FLY at the start, showed speed along the inner rail and weakened through the
stretch. GALACTIC TIDE , taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail around the turn and through the stretch and passed a tired
rival. SHE'S SO FLY bumped with COCKTAIL DREAMING after breaking awkwardly, rushed up three deep to press the pace on the turn and tired. BEE
QUEEN trailed.

Footnotes
BAPTIZE THE BOY , four wide outside rivals heading to the turn, stalked three wide mid turn, made a grinding run between runners while under right
handed asking and got up at the wire. BULL SHARK , bumped at the break, vied under rating and between rivals early, poked a head in front leaving the far
turn, spurted clear mid turn while confidently handled, was put to steady hand encouragement for the final sixteenth, kept on gamely but was nipped at the
line. AIR ON FIRE rated forwardly while off the inside, angled four wide into the lane, ranged up near the sixteenth pole but hung late. FAST CASH , off slow
when bumped from both sides at the break, regrouped and settled, circled five wide into the lane and had a mild rally. HARD FOUGHT took over early and
disputed the pace to the inside of BULL SHARK, eased back off that one near the three eighths, remained forward under coaxing into the lane, failed to kick
on past mid stretch and faded. VICTORY GIVEN , bumped at the break, dropped off the pace, raced three to four wide into the lane but lacked a bid.

Footnotes
LONG DISTANCE LOVE broke a step slow and was bumped, recovered and edged up in hand then rate off foes past the five eighths, steadied out of traffic
nearing the turn, moved up between runners while three wide past the five sixteenths, shifted out for room leaving the three sixteenths, leveled off when
roused right handed, closed nicely under steady hand pressure inside the final sixteenth, forged to the lead late and was widening at the wire. R AVERIE
LYNN sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail, took pressure around the turn while coaxed along, drifted three wide into the lane, was corrected with
right handed asks, braced for challenges in mid stretch and continued on gamely to the wire. DEVILISH AFFAIR was rated early while off the rail, moved up
four wide outside rivals mid turn, bid to press, battled outside the leader leaving mid stretch and hung. AWESOME VIEW prompted the pace then bid
between runners around the turn, altered in as the leader wandered soon into the lane, gave hard chase leaving the furlong grounds but came up empty.
MAUREENLOVESFRANK , brushed at the break, raced off the rail and between runners past the five sixteenths but came up empty. LITTLE MS SCARLET
, inside and within range leaving the far turn, was put to a ride soon after but failed to rally. FUDGE CAKE stumbled at the break and brushed with a rival,
regrouped and raced off the pace, was hung out four deep past the five sixteenths and faded.

Footnotes
MOSE PERFECT lacked speed, raced near the inner rail entering the turn, swung four wide leaving the turn, closed outside horses, gained the lead in mid
stretch and prevailed under urging. MOSLER SAFE prompted the pace outside JOHNNY SWISH, gained the lead approaching the stretch, lost the lead
approaching the eighth pole then held on stubbornly in the drive. MAILMAN'S A FLYER , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened the stretch.
FLAMING EAST bumped BIG DADDY D R when bearing in leaving the starting gate, was very wide turning for home and passed tired foes. BIG DADDY D
R , bumped leaving the starting gate, steadied in tight quarters leaving the backstretch then weakened. LUV YA BYE BYE , a forward factor along the inner
rail around the turn, weakened. JOHNNY SWISH showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. OBOY was no factor. BODE LYNX
briefly chased the pace between horses into the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
BLUE SKY VENEZUELA rated kindly tracking outside the leader, was floated out five wide advancing into the lane, had her rider lose the whip soon past
the three sixteenths, rolled up to go clear in mid stretch then held firm while steadily hand ridden to the wire. DAT DARES GOLD chased the pace while
saving ground, moved up towards the rail to threaten in mid stretch, flattened out late but saved the place. JOYFUL NOISE broke a bit slowly, settled off the
pace, came three wide into the lane, shifted out under pressure past the sixteenth pole and churned on. R TRUE SENSATION sped clear early, set the
pace towards the inside, drifted four wide while confronted entering the lane, fought on past the eighth pole then faded. PARCHED GHOST , off the pace
while saving ground, had belated action. GOLD TIME VIXEN chased off the rail, angled out a bit into the lane but lacked a bid. TORCH CARRIER , off the
pace and to the inside of a rival near the half mile marker, angled out for the drive but failed to muster up a solid run. ELOQUENT LADY chased three to
four wide, drifted out mid turn, was corrected in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
CONSULTANT stalked the pace down the backstretch under snug rating, gained a two wide lead entering the far turn and eagerly pulled away through the
stretch under a brisk hand ride. CURTEIS lacked speed, circled horses on the far turn, bumped with SOLOMON'S CHOICE in upper stretch and rallied
outside foes. BOURBON ON THE BAY lacked speed, raced five deep on the far turn and rallied. PURSUING PACE lacked speed, raced inside horses
throughout and had a slight rally. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS , three wide the first turn while trailing, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired
horses. SOLOMON'S CHOICE , three wide the first turn, was in the four path the far turn and bumped with CURTEIS in upper stretch. HINDENBURG ,
three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way in mid stretch. SECRET SOULMATE saved ground the first turn, worked between horses in the
stretch and weakened. ESPRESSO LUNGO set the pace along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
THE ADDISON POUR , a bit keen while four wide edging up into the backstretch, settled near the five eighths and allowed the duel to develop up front,
responded when given his cue and picked up the chase near the five sixteenths, circled into the lane, sustained under pressure and engaged UNCLE IRISH
with a furlong to go, dueled outside that won under strong handling and narrowly prevailed. UNCLE IRISH , rank off heels and steadied around the first turn,
tugged his way forward and stalked the embattled leaders three wide, moved to challenge leaving the far turn, spurted clear past the five sixteenths, dug in
when joined a furlong out, battled valiantly to the inside of the winner and just missed. ONE TEN , off the pace and three wide outside rivals, circled four
wide under a ride into the lane and kept on willingly to clearly best the rest. MAJESTIC FRONTIER was steadied nearing the first turn, recovered and raced
off the pace two to three wide, was under a solid ride pursuing past the five sixteenths but came up empty. KRUG saved ground, edged up nearing the half
mile marker, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths, angled out and faded. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY dueled two wide outside a rival, took over after a half
mile, failed to resist UNCLE IRISH leaving the three eighths, stayed on to pursue along the rail into the lane and weakened. SHAMATEUR took over early
and secured the inside, dueled from the three quarter pole to the far turn and faltered.
