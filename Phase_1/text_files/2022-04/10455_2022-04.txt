Footnotes
COUNTRY MAGIC stalked off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, drew to even terms two deep midway on the far turn then dug in determinedly
to eke out the nod over VINTAGE GIN through the stretch. The latter took over nearing the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace,
came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail into the far turn, was met midway through the turn and dug in gamely to
the finish. SHE FIGURES raced well back off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three wide and finished well.
IMAGOODCHATTERBUG saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and passed rivals in
an even finish. BOCA BIRDIE broke a bit awkwardly and steadied leaving the gate, raced well back off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path then flattened stride widest. MISS MORGANTOWN rated off the early pace in the three path, picked up
the chase from the three eighths pole, ran two deep on the far turn then weakened. WHIZ PASS saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SARGENT KOBE contested the pace inside through the front stretch and raced close on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took over past
the three eighths, dueled clear approaching the eighth pole and was steadily handled through the lane. GOLDEN METTLE saved ground well off the pace,
started a three wide bid approaching the three eighths pole, ran close three wide on the far turn and dueled clear in second past the eighth pole.
MEGALODON'SREVENGE contested the early pace two deep then set the pace into the first turn, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was
caught past the pole, raced close at the rail on the far turn then flattened into the lane. PULL UP MY SOCKS settled off the pace two deep then eased
outward into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and passed a rival in the lane. MOVED BY JUBA came
in at the break then rounded the first turn about the four path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. GANGHIS

Footnotes
CALLINGHERCOLLINS tapered in to stalk two deep, moved to even terms past the half mile pole and dueled from that point, contested the edge two deep
on the far turn, drew clear mid-stretch and widened later yards. TOY TIGER drew clear and angled to the inside to set the pace, was met leaving the half
mile pole and dueled from that point, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the far turn, but dropped back mid-stretch and settled for second.
CORAL SUMMER saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the stretch. CHEESE LOUISE
became a bit edgy in the gate and rounded the first turn in the three path, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn near the
rail and showed little more. BETTER BOAT raced well off the pace inside, ran at the rail on the far turn and could only improve her position.
WHYCANTTHISBELOVE ducked out to make contact with DAMISELA leaving the gate, ran in the three path the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths
pole then weakened off the rail on the far turn. The latter was bumped off stride leaving the gate and rounded the first turn about the four path, bid from the
seven sixteenths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn.

GRECIAN ADMIRAL rounded the opening turn in the three path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod in the three path toward the head of
the lane then dug in determinedly to edge out the game effort of ELVIRUS, who was rated off the pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
took the lead three wide approaching the quarter pole, drew clear midway on the far turn, was caught leaving the turn but dug in gamely to the finish. LIL
TOUGHMAN saved ground off the pace then eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, ran just off the rail on the far turn, angled to the six path
approaching the top of the lane and got up for third mid-stretch. PLAYBOY ROY rated close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
off the rail then flattened stride. BANNER MAN stalked the early pace two deep and moved to even terms at the nine sixteenths pole, challenged from the
seven sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened. JUST NOD AND SMILE saved ground and showed little response. WALK THE BANK
rated a slim lead inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and came under pressure nearing the seven sixteenths, gave up the lead approaching the
quarter pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. RED MESA rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase toward the three eighths pole but

Footnotes
PARISHIONER was hustled to the front toward the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, raced near the rail on the turn and was steadily handled
through the stretch. BAYTOWN JAKESTER pressured the pace, rounded the turn off the rail and had to settle for second best. TAPPING gave chase,
rounded the turn in the four path, drifted to the six path nearing the eighth pole and finished evenly. KING T'CHALLA gave chase, rounded the turn about
the five path, drifted to the seven path approaching the eighth pole then flattened the final sixteenth. SMELLSLIKEMONEY chased through the backstretch,
ran in the two and three paths of the turn then flattened. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS chased the early pace toward the inside, ran in the four path of the turn,
angled to the outside leaving the turn and passed some rivals. SPLIT THE PACK gave close early chase, ran at the rail on the turn then weakened.
LAMECH steadied lightly on the chute, gave chase and rounded the turn about the four path. NOW I'M BROKE gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the
turn and showed little more. RUN RABBIT gave early chase outside and rounded the turn about the three path.
