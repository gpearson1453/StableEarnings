Footnotes
AMERICAN PURE stalked the pace three wide into the far turn, bid through late turn, gained the lead straightening into the lane, cleared outside the eighth
pole then held. FIRST GLIMPSE pressed the pace two wide through the far turn, bid with the winner into the lane, could not keep up with that one then was
all out to last for the place spot. POLAR WIND was in the three path through the far turn, swung into the lane from the five path, gained momentum inside
the eighth pole, looked to be a place finisher and just missed. MINE OWN STAR set the pace from the two path into the far turn, was under pressure
through late turn, continued in proximity after straightening in the lane then faltered. POWERFUL POINT saved ground into the lane and never was a threat.
FEVER TEMPLE trailed throughout while near the inside.

SUMMER HOME stalked the two rival duel through mid-turn, moved to the front without much urging, cleared into the lane then held while being kept to the
task. LASHES chased the pace from the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path then chased the winner to the wire to be second
best. LEXI SUN raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path with aim on the top ones then could only manage to save the
show spot. BELLA BOLLE vied for the lead two wide through the turn then weakened through the lane. KISSES SO SWEET saved ground through the turn
and into the lane and offered a mild gain. SHARP JUSTICE was never a threat while in the two path through the turn. SAVEDBESTFORLAST was well back
while near the rail, angled into mid-track for the drive and never menaced. ROYAL TO BE vied for the lead along the inside, remained in contention into the
lane then gave way.
