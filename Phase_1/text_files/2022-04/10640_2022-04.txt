MOVE IT stalked the leader, wore down that rival late then edged outside challenge in the final yards. ELISHER advanced inside, angled out in the stretch,
rallied and just missed. THE FLUSH KING quickly sprinted clear to the final sixteenth and weakened. RATHER PRECOCIOUS chased very wide throughout
and lacked a rally. MONZZA prompted the pace three wide and began fading on the turn. HOMELAND MESSA steadied and bobbled near the three eighths
pole then moved very wide. PAT ME DOWN dropped back early and was always outrun. FELLER was taken up between rivals near the quarter pole and
proved no factor. PER RULING DATED 5/13/2022 RECEIVED FROM THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #24873) MOVE IT WAS

Footnotes
ALL MIKE NO MAE set a measured pace inside, widened when ready on the final turn then was geared down late. LUCK OF THE STARS saved ground
throughout, lugged in through the stretch but outdueled pair for the place award. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN allowed to settle, bid briefly on the final turn and
was outfinished for the place. CHIEF KIMOSABI saved ground off the leaders, bid outside in the stretch and flattened. JAYS HOLIDAY steadied just after
the start, chased wide and was no factor. ACABELLA was sluggish early and trailed and was never in contention. REVERENT broke alertly and flashed
speed for half a mile and stopped.

B W P SPECIAL settled wide, easily advanced three wide on the turn, took over into the stretch and stayed safe under a brisk hand ride. MY LITTLE
JUNIOR dueled along the inside, altered course in the lane and came again for the place. ETBAUER'S SECRET saved ground early then moved out in the
stretch with a mild rally. TIME TWISTER went after the winner three wide on the turn then faltered. BIG RUSSSS came over causing rival to clip heels early
then faded after dueling. ABBIE CAJUN STORM was shuffled back just after the break and never a factor. BLONDIE FIX IT clipped heels and bobbled in
the opening sixteenth then stopped abruptly. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident on the backstretch. BIG RUSSS was subsequently disqualified
and placed last for interfering with BLONDIE FIX IT.

Footnotes
GRAND ISLE SUMMER broke alertly and angled inside then remained clear throughout driving. KATIE'S C prompted the pace three wide and made a
gradual late gain. LA DANTA prompted the pace, moved inside on the turn and finished gamely. LOCO LUCY bumped about early, rushed to contention
between rivals then weakened. FLYING I dropped back inside then moved extremely wide into the stretch. COSMIC BELLE raced close up inside to midway
on the turn and faded. T J'S SUNSHINE was taken up sharply in the early stages and failed to recover. SECRET MOMENT raced far behind throughout.
