Footnotes
STRAPPING prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, responded under right handed urging to make the lead before the furlong marker and proved best
under brisk handling. AMES MISTER unhurried early, closed willingly in the seven path through the stretch and finished clear for second. INSACIABLE
PRINCE had a mild rally late. SUMMER LOAD stalked the early pace, drew closer in the three path entering the stretch, was herded out by the tiring
pacesetter, brushed by that one late then leveled off. PAPER FLOWERS had speed from the start while two wide into the stretch, gained ground three wide,
was brushed late then outfinished. WAR DOCTOR away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch, drifted out while but to a left handed
whip brushing a rivals then tired. HERO DRAGON trailed. PASSIONATE LUCK broke outward hitting the gate at the start and unseated his rider. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

BIG TRIP broke in front, set all the pace, turned back a bid from the runner up in upper stretch and drew off under confident handling. COLOMBARD chased
the winner into the stretch, loomed boldly two wide before the furlong marker then was no match while clearly second best. PRETTY STORMY stalked the
pace and went evenly in the five path through the stretch. NYOMAN close up outside rivals, failed to respond. UNCLE MOMO vied for the lead along the
inside into the stretch then faded late. SILENT TIGER was no factor. DREAM SATURDAY was no threat.

Footnotes
RISING OUTLAW broke in front, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under confident handling to win as much the best. REBOPPER unhurried,
trailed through the turn, angled in from the five to three paths nearing the furlong marker bumping MISTER MAN into MASTER, bulled his way through
between rivals and rallied for second. GRAND DEAL slow early, swung wide and closed a gap late in the middle of the racetrack. CHROMED IMPULSE
never far back, drew closer to the winner on the turn, had speed the balance of the trip but was outfinished. INHERENT POWERS went evenly.
GOODBYELLOWBRICKRD had speed into the stretch then faded. OVER IT was no factor. MISTER MAN settled along the inside into the stretch, angled
out to the three path pas the three sixteenths pole, was bumped into MASTER near the furlong marker then dropped back. MASTER pressured the winner
along the inside into the stretch, was bumped off stride at the furlong marker then stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER
REVIEW DISQUALIFIED REBOPPER AND PLACED HIM LAST.

GOOD IDEA well placed, split horses two wide nearing the quarter pole, made the lead then finished full of run under mild left handed urging to win going
away. READY TO MARCH broke in front, set the pace to the top of the stretch then was no match for the winner. BIGBADOX had a mild rally late inside.
JULIE'S FERRARI chased the leader into the turn, loomed boldly three wide before a half then failed to sustain that bid. AIN'T STRAIGHT bore in a few
strides out of the gate bumping hard with rivals, advanced four wide on the turn then came up empty. PLEASE SIT DOWN bore out badly bumping hard with
TOUCHDOWN JESUS at the start and was never involved. TOUCHDOWN JESUS was bumped hard between rivals at the start and failed to menace. THE
STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
CHISELED JUSTICE never far back, closed willingly three wide to make the lead in deep stretch and drew off. THAT'S THE WAY unhurried early, rallied
determinedly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. ELLADA PINOT pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set
the pace past the furlong marker then was outfinished. RED HOT POWER had speed from the start along the inside, altered course to the six path entering
the stretch then went evenly. SPLIT MY BRITCHES failed to menace. COWTOWN BOSS broke in front, set the pace along the inside past the five
sixteenths pole, had speed into the stretch then gave way readily. ZIP IT QUICK was no factor. CADILLAC RIDE was a forward factor along the rail,
checked when in tight entering the turn then dropped out of it. ZAKARIA broke as step slow then swerved at the start, offered a mild bid in the five path on
the turn then stopped.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOUNTAIN bumped at the start, sprinted clear soon thereafter, set all the pace and won under confident handling. UPTOWN GUY chased the
winner, moved closer along the rail through upper stretch then was no match while hanging on for second. FIRST VICTORY never far back, finished with
good courage in the six path. WILD ENOUGH bumped at the start then went evenly. BILLY NOT WILLIAM passed tiring rivals. COPPER GIDEON was no
factor. FATTERTHANME had brief speed. CAPTAIN CHOLO had speed along the inside into the turn then flattened out.
