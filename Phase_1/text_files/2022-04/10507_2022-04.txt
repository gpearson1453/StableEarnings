Footnotes
WITH THATBEINGSAID set a pressured pace while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths marker, remained in control through
mid-stretch and was fully extended to hold off the closing AVA K'S GIRL. AVA K'S GIRL was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn and was gaining on the winner late. SHIP'S CREEK showed brief speed, dropped back nearing the five-sixteenths marker, moved four-wide through
the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. YELLOW DRESS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not
threaten. MONGOLIAN ROSE was void of early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HOLY TUTTA BELLA pressed the pace while
racing four-wide, lugged out through the turn and weakened.

TIME TO ZOOM was hustled along to open a clear margin at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, increased his lead into the stretch and was not
urged late as a handy winner. GOLDEN TIGER raced unhurried early, advanced five-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. SPENDAHOLIC chased the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. LIL LATIGO was forwardly placed
from the inside and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
RED BOTTOM REBEL sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, increased her margin into the lane and was not urged as the easiest
of winners. INFO'S TREASURE was off slow, raced unhurried early, moved six-wide through the second turn and was up for the place. RANDOM
PLEASURE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. WIN LIKE COACH P chased the leaders while
racing four-wide and gave way in the drive. TROPHY CHEST showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and failed to menace.
AINTTHATRIGHTUHHUH lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. TRINNI SUNSET chased the leaders from the
inside and weakened after going three-quarters.

Footnotes
SOUTH FRESNO settled off the leaders from between foes, moved advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore with a quarter to run,
quickly opened a clear lead and was ridden out to the wire. CLUB CHAMP was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn,
was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. POPPY'S C NOTE dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and gave way to the winner
after going three-quarters. VALLEY WILDCAT raced four-wide through the first turn while racing off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the
second turn and finished evenly in the drive. TOP ROCKET chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. SECOND
BOLD disputed the pace from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. ROWDYROOSTER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the
second turn and was not a factor. PRICE TO PAY raced four-wide through the first turn and lagged throughout.

GORDY'S RULES raced four-wide through the first turn then was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, drifted in to
bump KING PARKER in mid-stretch, was quickly straightened away, gained command and drew clear. KING PARKER broke sharply to set a pressured
pace while racing four-wide, bumped with the winner with a furlong to run and yielded to that rival in the drive. LOLLY EXPRESS was void of early speed,
saved ground through the second turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished with some late run. SHOTGUN RIDER was void of early speed,
raced five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. FIRE WHEN READY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and weakened. START A RUNNIN was off a step slow, rushed to contend, raced just off the leaders, moved five-wide through the second turn and
weakened. OUR DANDY'S BOY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.. OSTINI raced five-wide through
the first turn, pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE
BUMPING BETWEEN GORDY'S RULES AND KING PARKER IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
D K'S CROWN was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady urging to be up in the final yards and going
away late. SIR DEPUTY was away in good order to duel for the lead with GEORGIAN ROAD while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
quarter but could not resist the winner from over the top. GEORGIAN ROAD disputed the pace with the winner from the inside and gave way late.
HARROVIAN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SUNLAND STAR lagged early, raced six-wide through the turn and
did not menace. WHENDUCKSFLY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
