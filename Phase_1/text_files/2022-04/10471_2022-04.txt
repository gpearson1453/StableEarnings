Footnotes
TOM'S REGRET off alertly to begin, took control then cleared and steered to the two path, angled to the rail around the turn, roused late on the bend and
powered away under hand urging. SMOKIN AMELIA stumbled shortly after the start, chased along the rail into the turn, shifted to the two path around the
bend, could not make any headway on the winner but kept on to prove second best. THE REIGN SONG was off slow and broke out a bit, tracked in range
at the back, went four then three wide around the bend while outside rivals and could not summon the needed rally. PAYTRICIA up close then got shuffled
back a bit between rivals early, chased three wide into the turn, raced between foes then trailed in the two path past the quarter pole and weakened in the
drive. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
VIRULENTE (FR) broke a bit slow, became rank for a bit while box in entering the first turn, bid three deep around the far turn, fought four wide into the
lane, drifted inward in upper stretch while taking the lead, cleared nearing the sixteenth pole and held well. TRAVEL SMART pulled and steadied off heels
into the first turn, raced in range up the backstretch, traveled along the rail ten two wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out in
midstretch and gained second. BIG ROSIE hustled to the front and moved inside, set the pace with company alongside in the middle stages, headed by
rival past the three-eighths pole, gave up command midway around the turn but continued to fight on from inside, battled with winner in to the final furlong
but faltered in deep stretch. PRECIOUS INSIGHT stalked in the two path around the first turn, applied pressure from outside up the backstretch, took over
midway around the far turn, led three wide into the lane, lost command in upper stretch then had her path taken and checked shortly after, then weakened in
the furlong grounds. TIZZY TWISTER was off slow from outside, went three deep into the first turn, became hard to manage and lugged out around the
bend, steered back to the inside nearing the backstretch, trailed into the second bend, saved ground to the lane, angled out and back inward in the drive
and could not rally. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT ALTHOUGH VIRULENTE (FR) SHIFTED IN AND CAUSED PRECIOUS
INSIGHT TO CHECK IN UPPER STRETCH, IT DID NOT COAST HER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING AND NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
NORAH'S PRINCESS broke slow from inside, angled off the rail in the early going, went three wide into the turn, steered five wide into the stretch, closed
widest through the late and proved best in the end. TRACY DI VICENZO stumbled a bit leaving the gate but quickly recovered, chased four deep into the
turn, five wide around the bend, launched a bid in deep stretch but got outkicked by the winner. THREE POINT OH broke a bit slow, raced greenly chasing
up the backstretch, look to advance but ran into some traffic around the bend, split foes with a quarter mile remaining, steered down to the inside, rallied up
the rail and missed the place. SMILING MOLLY cleared the field to take control early, angled down to the inside, driven two wide into the stretch, led clear
into the final furlong, clung to a short lead with a sixteenth remaining and weakened late. LADY MARYANN chased three deep into turn, raced between foes
while four wide around the bend and flattened late. SAPADILLA tracked off the rail, went two then three wide around the turn and could not rally. SQUARE

Footnotes
BICAMERAL prominent early along the rail, chased the leader into the backstretch, moved out and applied pressure in hand at the seven-sixteenths pole,
took over midway around the far turn, disposed of BROCADE and angled to the rail, then drew away in upper stretch and widened to the wire under urging.
ANGEL NADESHIKO bothered by rival three wide on the first turn and floated to the four path, sat off the pace between rivals, went three then two wide on
the far turn, could not gain on the winner in the final furlong and settled for second best. CHLOE'S GIRL sent from the gate and showed speed between
rivals then got shuffled back early on the clubhouse turn, dropped back off the pace, ridden along while saving ground on the far turn, tipped out at the top of
the stretch and held the show. ANGEL OF FREEDOM dropped back early and steered to the inside, moved out on the backstretch, came four wide into the
lane and never threatened. MIDNIGHT SILENCE broke a step slow, went four wide into the first turn and got floated out to the five path by inner rival,
moved closer leaving the backstretch, took the second turn four then three wide and came up empty. BROCADE had speed outside a pair of rivals, cleared
inside pair and crossed over, showed the way up the backstretch, took pressure at the seven-sixteenths pole, relinquished command midway around the
bend, lost past the quarter pole and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT JOY bobbled and brushed leaving the gate, pulled early along the inside, had to paused while racing off the heels of the leader into the
backstretch, lacked room past the three-eighths pole, remained inside and gained a clear path, angled out in the stretch, reeled in the runner-up and drove
clear. STARSHIP DEFIANT chased three wide around the first turn, moved up to duel from outside, cleared midway around the far turn, could not fend off
the winner nearing the sixteenth pole but was clearly second best. FLORAL ESSENCE hit the gate and broke out to brush rival, traveled along the inside
then angled out on the first turn, went three deep into the far turn, exited that bend two to three wide and weakened. ZAHRA coaxed from the gate but
trailed three wide into the first turn then moved to the two path, went between foes at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out into the stretch and churned on
to earn a minor award while failing to threaten. MORNING ADDICTION lost footing and came away a bit slow, sped to the front in the two path, dueled with
STARSHIP DEFIANT to the outside, could not keep pace around the second bend and started to weaken, then faded in the lane. LA PULCINELA went two
wide early on the first turn then got floated out to the five path around the bend, trailed four wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ARTHUR SPOONER stumbled a bit leaving the gate but was still away quickest, set the pace under pressure from outside, dueled with VANISKY on the far
turn, cleared that rival at the top of the stretch and held well under urging. VANISKY attended the pace three deep, challenged three wide on the far turn,
lost contact with the winner at the top of the stretch, drifted out slowly in the lane and stayed on to cut into the lead late while holding the place. HOTROD
RIDE broke a bit slow from inside, angled five wide around the far turn, produced a mild rally but could not threaten the winner. SIPPIN N KISSIN broke
awkwardly in the beginning, rated three wide early then further out on the backstretch, asked four wide on the second turn and flattened out in the stretch.
FORGOTTEN VOWS coaxed from the gate, raced a bit off the rail early on then saved ground on the second turn and weakened. PAULAS CAUSE rounded
the first turn four wide, got floated out to the six path early on the far turn then steered down to the three path late on the bend and failed to menace. BIG
WILD WEST pressed the pace from outside then between leaving the backstretch, failed to keep up on the far turn and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
ROSE MADDOX settled inside, went between foes on the far turn, entered the lane two wide, steered back to the inside, got bothered by MADIHA with a
furlong to go, challenged up the rail in the final sixteenth and edged past in the closing moments. MADIHA stalked along the inside, coaxed while saving
ground into the stretch, took over and cleared approaching the eighth pole, led into deep stretch and got edged by the winner late. EMERALD LAKE tracked
three wide early, stayed off the rail and came four wide into the lane, bid widest in upper stretch but needed more to get by the top pair. FUNNY FELINE
sped clear and led three wide around the first turn, led two wide up the backstretch, moved to the inside for the final turn, showed the way two wide into the
stretch and weakened. GIRL RANGER broke awkwardly, tucked inside at the back on the first turn, trailed into the second bend, angled out and came four
wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. GIANNA'S WILD CAT stalked the lone leader outside a rival, driven three wide into the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON stalked the top pair from outside, bid three deep around the turn, cleared in upper stretch and held well through the final sixteenth.
QUICK FINISH chased off the rail, went two then three wide around the turn, tipped four wide in the lane, finished willingly and outkicked BEAR CHUM
(AUS) for the place. BEAR CHUM (AUS) sat off the pace along the rail, tipped to the two path entering the lane, finished well in the furlong grounds but got
edged for the place honors. CHARGE CASH away quickest from the gate, dueled outside STARSHIP CHEWBACCA early, fought between rivals on the
turn and faltered in the final furlong. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA dueled inside CHARGE CASH up the backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals around the turn
and weakened in the lane. VERY IRISH dropped back early, went three wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend, steered out in the lane and
never threatened. HEARTFULLOFSTARS was off a bit slow and lost his path at the start, steered out into the clear, went four to five wide around the turn
and weakened. CAJUN TREASURE chased off the rail, entered the turn two wide, lost ground through the bend and came three wide into the drive and had
little left. SHARP WARNING broke out and brushed rival leaving the gate, trailed on the inside then two wide into the stretch and was never a factor.
