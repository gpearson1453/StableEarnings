CONTINENTALCONGRES , nicely rated along the rail behind horses down the backstretch, eased out to the three path approaching the stretch, secured
command in upper stretch, lugged in near the sixteenth pole despite her rider's efforts and drew out under urging. STACKS OF SILVER , four deep entering
the first turn, chased the pace down the backstretch, gained a two wide lead mid way on the far turn then weakened in the drive. BLAMEITONTHEFUN ,
three wide both turns, offered a mild move leaving the backstretch and gave way after six furlongs. GOLD GUY set the pace along the inner rail and gave
way turning for home.

Footnotes
SICK PACK SARA cleared early and dropped in to dictate the pace, came under a ride entering the lane, increased her advantage past the furlong grounds
and was kept to a solid hand ride to the wire. JEANIE'S ANGEL stalked the pace three wide, was under pressure into the stretch, wandered outward near
the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. JOYFUL NOISE broke a step slow, moved up four wide outside rivals into the turn, made steady progress
leaving the three sixteenths, dove inside a drifting rival near the sixteenth marker and finished well. DAT DARES GOLD , off the pace two wide, swung five
wide for the drive and closed steadily. CALYPSO GHOST had speed to the inside then was taken to rate off the winner, dropped back a bit leaving the far
turn, failed to kick on under asking in upper stretch and faded. ELOQUENT LADY , three wide stalking the early pace, was getting out leaving the far turn
and gave way.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE settled off the early while four wide, dropped in advancing leaving the far turn, took closer order mid turn, slipped through along the
rail to take over with a quarter mile remaining, spurted clear under solid handling then held firm while kept alert. TATE dropped off the pace and was put to
strong asking near the three eighths, angled four wide for the drive and came on well through the final seventy yards. NAUTILUS angled out early and
stalked the pace, crept closer while three wide near the three eighths, bid outside a pair of rivals with a quarter to go, gave hard chase after the winner
cleared but flattened out late. WICKED PRANKSTER cleared early, set the pace off the inside, was surrounded past the five sixteenths, fought on to about
mid stretch then gave way. I AM THE CASH MAN , off the pace while saving ground, swung four wide into the lane but failed to menace. DESPITE ODDS ,
away alertly, drafted back off the pace while three wide, angled in under a ride leaving the far turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths and weakened.

VINNY stalked the pace inside horses down the backstretch, advanced in the two path to gain the lead between horses leaving the far turn, opened up in
mid stretch and lasted. SUCCEED , four wide the first turn, circled foes four deep on the far turn and rallied. REMEMBERING WILBUR lacked speed,
worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. NIGHT BOSS , four wide mid way on the first turn, challenged for the lead three deep leaving
the far turn and tired. COASTAL CHAOS , forwardly placed along the inner rail down the backstretch, weakened on the far turn. AUSPICIOUS LAD ,
unhurried early, was outrun and raced wide leaving the far turn. CAPTAIN QUINT was always outrun. MAKE THE WAY CLEAR set the pace along the inner
rail and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
EASTERN BAY had speed between rivals then dropped back a bit into the turn, came under pressure leaving the three eighths, angled five wide with
momentum into the lane and spied the duel, rolled up outside foes and engaged SPUN AND WON nearing the eighth pole, struck the top soon after and
eagerly widened under a drive. SPUN AND WON had speed four wide between rivals then dropped down and emerged in a battle to the inside of VALUED
NOTION, gained a short lead into the lane, failed to contain the winner leaving the furlong grounds but kept on well to be clearly second best. GOING TO
THE LEAD , urged inside foes but unable to get the lead, eased back off the leaders nearing the turn, stalked two wide past the five sixteenths, had room
near mid stretch but failed to seriously kick on. VALUED NOTION had speed five deep early, angled in some and dueled outside SPUN AND WON into and
around the turn, ceded command nearing the lane and weakened through the final sixteenths. SEMPER FI dropped off the pace, angled six wide for the
drive and had some mild late interest. CHARGE TO VICTORY , three wide making a run mid turn, pursued the duelers into the stretch and faded. SEANOW
had speed between foes, steadied back out of close quarters nearing the half mile marker, shifted in and faded.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN saved ground around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch, closed steadily outside PLAMEN and took the lead approaching the
finish. ROUGH SEA lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and in upper stretch, angled out inside the eighth pole and closed between horses.
PLAMEN set the pace along the rail, opened up leaving the turn and tired late. HALITE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, circled the
turn four deep, was well positioned in upper stretch and flattened out. AWESOME D J , never a factor, swung to the five path entering the stretch. EVEN
THUNDER , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gave way entering the stretch. THE GREAT DANSKY , three wide on the turn, chased the
pace, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
MILLEAN pulled his way clear around the first turn, set a rated pace, came three wide into the lane, responded when roused nearing mid stretch and was
ridden out to the wire. DEJOHN stalked the winner, shifted in towards the rail leaving the far turn, pursued from there and stayed on willingly to be well clear
of the rest. ICE RAIN , three wide early, angled in and edged up nearing the half mile marker, came back out around the final turn, drifted out leaving mid
stretch and faded. GOLDIE'S BOY lagged well back, saved ground most of the way and lacked a serious rally. ROCKIN RON , four wide early, chased to
the outside a rival entering the far turn, failed to kick on after six furlongs and dropped back. TRIGZ , four wide early, faltered after a half mile and was eased
through the lane.
