Footnotes
GHOST STRATEGY forwardly placed toward the inside, rail bid second turn, protracted duel, came out slightly a sixteenth out as the runner up lugged in,
edged clear late. JACKS SPRING BREAK vied into the first turn, narrowly set the pace off the inside, responded when the winner challenged in the second
turn, dueled through upper stretch, lugged in with a sixteenth remaining, outkicked late. SERBIAN SAILOR tracked the leaders along the inside, continued
one paced through the stretch to prove no match for the top two the final furlong, well clear of the others. TRAFFIC CONTROL within striking distance four
down to three wide through the first turn, remained within striking distance up the backstretch and into the far turn, came up empty through the lane to finish
up evenly. POINT BLANK five wide into the first turn, angled in a bit in the first turn, remained outside in the second flight, also lacked a closing response.
MORE THAN HAMAZING off slow, lacked speed just off the inside, three wide onto the backstretch, continued back and also failed to muster a closing
response. OTHER TIMES fell back after the start, was never involved. ACCEL JOE broke back, trailed, showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HIGHTAILING broke on top, cleared early under a snug hold, continued to rate in the run up the backstretch, shook off a rival turning for home, well clear,
ridden out. TONE IT UP closest to the winner off the inside, chased that one up the backstretch, lodged a brief and mild bid midway on the final turn, proved
no match in the drive. PURE SILK settled off the pace just off the inside, saved some ground through the second turn, proved no match for the top two in the
drive to finish up evenly. MILLIGANMIKEANDME lacked speed in the two path, continued back the middle half, improved a bit into the lane, never a serious
threat. BACKGATE BELLE stumbled at the start, fell back, remained always back in failing to threaten. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE broke back, moved up outside
in the first turn, four wide onto the backstretch, tired from those early efforts through the lane. BRAHMS IS WHO saved ground to no avail to be finished
early.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTES WAY moved up to clear soon after the start, continued to lead by daylight when given a bit a breather through the turn, held the runner up
safe late under steady handling. PONTIFFANY forwardly placed just off the inside early, dropped inside turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker,
shifted out and was cutting the margin on that one late. CYCOLOGIST in mid pack while inside, steadied slightly into the turn, moved out, came five wide
into the lane, rallied for the show, no threat to the top pair. TRUEBLUEGIRL broke back, lacked speed to trail into the lane, improved position through traffic
with some late interest. MY DADDY'S TRAINER off slow and was bothered, well back inside, angled out turning for home, also improved with some belated
interest. MANDONA broke out then came in to bother MY DADDY'S TRAINER, was righted to race in the second flight into the turn inside, came three wide
into the lane, had little left for the stretch run. CANDY'S STORY broke alertly, chased the winner for a half just off the inside, retreated steadily through the
lane. SENSING GOLD in mid pack while racing the two path, had nothing for the drive. ADELE'S BLING was never involved. MAGGIE'S WILL in the second
group while just off the inside, gave way in the lane.

Footnotes
MOUNT ATHOS within striking distance off the inside, advanced three wide to challenge late in the turn, shaken up vigorously past the furlong marker,
kicked strongly clear. AMONGST FRIENDS broke back, lacked early foot toward the inside, angled out to be six wide turning for home, rallied widest to be
second best, no real threat to the winner. VODKA N WATER in mid pack early while racing just off the inside, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally be
clear for the show. HANKS off step slow, back early, steered four wide behind traffic turning into the straight, also improved while too late. BIG BOSS BEN
forwardly placed off the inside early, lost some position inside of traffic late in the turn, brief wait, evenly when clear. SALADO away in good order, pace
inside, continued to vie into the lane when asked along, faltered the final furlong. OTTOMAN EMPIRE off a step slow, remained back in failing to menace.
RIDGEPOINTE chased the leader early, moved closer in the turn then gave way for the drive.

CHAI TEA in the second flight toward the inside, traffic along the inside late in the turn, shifted out a bit, bid between rivals with a furlong remaining, drove
clear. SWEETNESS TO broke alertly, set the pace inside, headed late in the turn, regained briefly inside the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the
winner until late, held sway for the place,. EARLY DISMISSAL void of speed, four wide when trailing into the lane, knifed in past the furlong marker under
clever handling to get a late to run in, finished willingly just off the inside to be gaining for the place. DERONDA forwardly placed while racing outside, came
three wide into the stretch, encountered some traffic past midstretch, finished up evenly when clear late. HALF SCOUT fell back to trail after the start,
dropped inside turn, improved a bit while not a serious threat. MO STYLISH with the pace off the inside, dueled turn, gained advantage, drifted out nearing
midstretch and faltered. BOOTLEGGING GIRL forwardly placed while off the inside and between horses, had nothing for the drive. STORMY SERMON in

CHAKRA with the pace from the start just off the inside, dropped to the rail for the run through the turn, clear into the lane while saving ground, held the
runner up safe late under steady handling. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY prompted the pace from the outside, continued to pressure the winner through the
bend, lost some ground to that one into the stretch, trying to come back on that one late, clear for the place. GIRLS A BULLET behind the pace, in traffic,
shuffled back into the turn, moved a bit closer late in the turn, evenly through the stretch. TIGER BAIT settled outside when toward the front, four wide
through the turn, improved a bit while not a serious threat. PROUD VICTORIA forwardly placed while three wide and between horses, came up empty for
the stretch. BOATHOUSE VIEW pressed early in the two path, fell back along the inside turn, not a threat through the lane. FABLES LOVE AFFAIR off a
step slow, raced back, saved ground through the turn, improved inside of horses into the stretch, went flat the final furlong. FIVE QUEENS remained back
while racing three wide, failed to rally. LIL MISS HOT MESS broke slowly, moved out, raced four wide and made a mild move through the turn then tired in

Footnotes
VULCAN broke alertly, set the pace inside, shook clear into the stretch, kept to task in maintaining a comfortable advantage to the wire.
TURNSANDCONDITIONS off the pace in the two path, steered out a bit wider into the stretch, finished with good late energy to be going away for the
second spot, too much to do in order to get to the winner. SITTIN ON GO off a step slow, trailed for a half while three wide through the turn, staged a
belated rally well out in the strip to prove best of the rest. BIG THORN pressed the issue for three furlongs between rivals and outside the winner, dropped
back then moved to the inside late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch. HAPPYMAC forwardly placed and three wide in the run up the backstretch,
closest to the winner entering the stretch, faltered in the drive. NAME REJECTED in the second flight while saving ground, backed up after three furlongs.
OUR BLUE JAY remained always back. WILD FOR WYCLIFF with the lead pack while widest up the backstretch, four wide far turn, gave way.

Footnotes
TOP GUNNER with the pace while three wide backstretch, helped set a rapid opening quarter, continued to wing while edging clear late in the turn, well
clear with a furlong remaining, enough left to hold off the runner up late. LYKAN outrun early off the inside, came three wide into the lane, finished fast to be
rapidly getting to the winner. COUNTY FINAL vied up front in the run up the backstretch between rivals through those quick fractions, fell back off the winner
late in the turn, moved out three wide into the lane, has little left for the stretch run but managed to save the show. ONE FAST CAT washy, raced well off the
early pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, lacked a closing response. MOLTO VIVACE with the pace along the inside four three furlong, in a bit
tight early in the turn, fell back soon after, continued to weaken through the stretch. FLAP JACK last away, trailed most of the way in remaining back while
racing in the two path. COLONEL BOWMAN saved ground to no avail, tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER OF MOLTO VIVACE AGAINST COUNTY FINAL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE INTO THE TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BALI DREAMIN close from the start, crept closer in the two path through the turn, floated out a bit turning for home, took over, drove clear under steady
handling. CHURCH SERVICE in mid pack and off the inside, improved in the two path through the turn in some traffic, finished willingly to earn the place,
not a serious threat to the winner. SOPHIE GRACE in the main body well wide, came four to five wide out of the turn, also turned in a willingly finish while
not enough for the place. CHARTREUSE in the second flight outside, moved closer while four wide late in the turn, flattened out a bit in the run to the wire.
CANDYWRAPPER CRAZY forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, checked up with a half mile to run, fell back and went evenly through the lane.
OUT DANCING last away, void of speed, swung four wide into the lane, improved position with some belated interest. COASTAL CHARM back off the pace,
in the two path through the turn, fell back into the lane then passed some tiring rivals through the lane in making little impact. DISTORTED SECRETS in mid
pack in the run up the backstretch, bit closer three wide and between horses late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. ADRIA broke alertly, cleared to the
inside early, set the pace for a half then gave way when headed by the winner turning for home. QUICK MUNNY remained back in failing to threaten.
MAXINE'S CANDY finished early, trailed home.
