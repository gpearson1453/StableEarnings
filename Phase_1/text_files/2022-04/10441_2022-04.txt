throughout and closed well to gain the place. ANGEL RAPHAEL settled within range inside then flattened out through the stretch. LUSCIOUS LOLA
prompted the pace in the two path and began fading on the turn. MAD MARY dropped back in the two path and lacked a response. COTTON CANDY
CUTIE chased just off the pace wide and gave way readily. THATTA BOY GIRL flashed speed three wide down the backstretch and stopped.

KEEPING THE PEACE settled close up, split rivals to the front on the turn and drew away while kept to his task. CLASSIFIED INFO prompted the pace
three wide, moved closer on the turn and finished willingly. SIX CIDER trailed far behind then offered late energy along the inside. CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY
dropped off the pace down the backstretch then proved empty in the lane. CURRENT HOPE forced the pace along the rail to midway on the turn and faded.
YEI YEI earned a narrow advantage outside then was finished after half a mile. BIG BAD BUD lacked speed and weakened steadily.

SHE'SFIRSTCLASS chased wide throughout and continued willingly. USING COCONUTS lacked speed inside, was asked for run after half a mile but was
no threat. OUTLINE raced within range early then gave way readily. SUPER DUPER FLY pursued the winner to the final turn and stopped.

LUCKY RUNNING CAT tracked on the inside, bid two wide on the far turn, gained a short lead turning for home, dug in gamely in the final furlong and held
well for the win. MISCHIEVOUS JONES raced four wide early, settled three or four wide off the pace, went four wide on the far turn, rallied outside rivals in
the stretch run and dug in gamely to the end. MARGIN OF AIR raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied
mildly between rivals and finished evenly. ICY COLD set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely and
then weakened. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE stalked two wide, then chased three wide, raced between rivals on the far turn and had no rally. NICKY DA FOX
raced three wide early, settled off the pace between rivals and failed to threaten. SOCIAL JOE was reluctant loading, off a bit slow and outrun. BIGSHOT
ON NOTHING stalked the leader in the early stages, then chased, gave way and stopped in the lane.

far turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch run and battled to the end. LIL MISS HOTSHOT pressed the pace in the early stages, then chased
outside, lacked a winning bid and finished evenly. LADY BREXIT tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and had no rally. LONDONDERRY

FLATTERING RUBY pursued the loose leader, was carried wide near the top of the stretch then edged away through the lane. BUCKS SOME lagged far
behind for half a mile then closed with a rush outside too late. WILDCAT CARTRIDGE saved ground just off the pace, angled out in the stretch and finished
willingly. EMPRESS DEONA moved clear in the opening quarter, was collared on the turn, drifted out and tired. SEEKING THE DREAM prompted the pace
outside and began stopping on the turn.
