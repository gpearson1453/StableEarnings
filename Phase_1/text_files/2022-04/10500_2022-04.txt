Footnotes
PRINCESS KAIRA trailed early, advanced inside on the turn, angled out at the quarter pole, surged in the stretch and pulled clear. CAPE COD SALLY
alternated for the lead inside and continued willingly. LADY BERNADETTE chased wide within range down the backstretch and had a mild rally. BALBOA'S
SMILE hustled from the outset, faded on the turn then offered some late energy. LUNA FORTUNA dueled for the lead in the two path and weakened in the
stretch. MISBEHAVING LADY lacked speed, trailed entering the stretch and passed faders. THREE POTATOE FOUR saved ground off the leaders and
began fading on the turn. PARABLE well placed outside the dueling leaders and proved empty in the stretch.

continued gamely but was nailed nearing the wire. KINGSVILLE forced the pace outside throughout and was outfinished in the final yards. MIDNIGHT ACT
squeezed back early, raced wide throughout and closed well too late. LONG GRAY LINE trailed inside, raced in traffic at the top of the stretch then rallied
late. SUPER DUDE was urged close up three wide to the stretch and flattened out. INSPIRED OPTIONS raced off the pace between rivals then proved
empty in the stretch.

OTIS OTIS OTIS sped to the front inside, widened on the turn and remained safe while kept to a steady drive. BURN AND TURN angled inside moving
closer on the turn then went evenly late. CALL FITZROY lagged far behind, closed the gap inside, angled out and split rivals with late energy. WHAT'S TO
BLAME broke sluggishly, chased in the two path and closed well. DEFIBRILLATOR raced very wide on the turn and through the stretch. GOLDENLINEOF
raced just off the leaders inside and weakened in stretch. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR prompted the pace outside to the stretch and faltered. WEEKEND IN
COURT dropped far behind and was never in contention. LUCKY HERO lacked speed far back outside and gave way readily. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD
injured himself at the gate and was ordered scratched by the stewards.

Footnotes
BRINDISI settled inside, saved ground throughout, edged to the front passing the eighth pole and edged outside rival following a long drive. LOOSE ENDS
moved inside after half a mile, angled outside rallying into the stretch, closed well and just missed. THREE COMMA GLENN prompted the pace outside, led
at the quarter pole, was challenged from both sides into the stretch and weakened through the final furlong. PRACTICAL COACH raced within range three
wide for half a mile and faded. TURNPIKE BOB set a pressured pace inside, resisted when challenged but proved empty in the final quarter mile. A
DANGEROUS GUY dropped back wide and stopped losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
MAP OF AMERICA well placed behind the dueling leaders, took over into the stretch and drew off while kept to her task. SENSE A MILLION trailed down
the backstretch then offered late energy for the place. CLOUT CHASER dropped far behind outside and was up late for the show. GOD STILL LOVES ME
broke sluggishly, moved up inside then flattened out. STILL ALIVE dropped back while trying to bear out on turn then came again passing pair of rivals.
EMPRESS DEONA rushed to the front inside then proved empty in the stretch. ABOVE THE LIMIT prompted the leader to the three eighths pole and
stopped.

DR ZRADA far back early, moved inside, split rivals rallying in the stretch and drew off through the final furlong. PYLON hustled to a clear lead inside, was
collared in midstretch and continued willingly. NINE TOE JOHNNY eased back in traffic in the opening quarter, moved outside in the lane but flattened out
late. DON'T RECALL trailed along the inside early closed well outside late. SAILOR AGAIN lacked speed, faded on the turn then finished well. EXTREME
FORCE prompted leaders four wide and faded after half a mile. MASTER OF WAR saved ground far behind and never a factor. LAZARETTO challenged
leader outside on the turn then faltered. PRIVATE NETWORK chased outside, moved extremely wide and gave way. ALPHA'S CANDY MAN broke
awkwardly, rushed to contention inside then stopped.
