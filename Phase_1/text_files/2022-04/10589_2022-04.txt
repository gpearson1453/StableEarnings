Footnotes
WILD UNION raced close up in the early stages, pressed the pace from the outside, bid on the far turn, dueled with PRIVATE NETWORK through the
stretch run and edged away late to prevail. PRIVATE NETWORK set the pace on the inside, dueled with WILD UNION coming to the quarter pole, battled it
out with that rival through the lane and dug in gamely inside to the finish. SLEW TANG CLAN tracked on the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn,
lacked a rally to challenge the leaders and was well clear for the show spot. MASTER OF WAR raced four wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased
on the far turn and tired. NIANGUA raced three wide on the clubhouse turn, stalked between rivals, chased and failed to respond. ABDAA raced off the pace
inside, came three wide into the lane and did not factor. MITHRA was outrun.

ALWAYS TALKING set a pressured pace inside, resisted challenges and lasted driving. REITERATE bid three wide on the turn, loomed a threat but could
not get by the winner. BLUNT FORCE lacked speed then finished full of run too late. MRS. CREWS saved ground off the leaders and continued well while
no threat. SNOW FORECAST reluctant loading, pressed the winner outside and proved empty in the stretch. BOCA ROYALTY trailed to the stretch then
caught a fading rival. ANGINETTI dropped back outside and lacked a response.
