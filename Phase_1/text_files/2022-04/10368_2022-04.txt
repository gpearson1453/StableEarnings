BURR HILL BULLET rated a clear lead from the three eighths pole, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole and held well under steady handling.
REMYS GUNSMOKE was hustled to contention and pressured the early pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the turn,
though, settled for second best. ANGELA'S ROMEO was reluctant to load and broke a bit awkwardly, gave chase outside through the backstretch, rounded
the turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the stretch. SCARE DEM chased inside, raced off the rail on the turn, drifted approaching the eighth
pole and showed little in the lane. MANHATTAN WEAVE gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. TIMMY gave chase and rounded the
turn about the five path.

ONE SMART COOKIE closed to even terms at the five sixteenths pole and contested the rail on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the
turn and inched clear later yards. SUPER WILDCAT accelerated between horses to take a slim lead at the five sixteenths pole, contested the turn two deep,
dug in leaving the turn, though, reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. URKILLINGMEBETH chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the five and
six paths and came along for third later yards. FLIRTING FUHR AVIE gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the stretch.
TRACI'S GIRL set a pressured pace most of the opening quarter mile, was met at the five sixteenths pole then faded in the three path of the turn. DEW DAT

Footnotes
LADY MADISON rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked leaving the turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, came through the far turn
about the three path, dug in for the lead later yards and drew clear approaching the wire. LADY KAZA rated the pace inside, came under pressure past the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but gave up the lead later yards. TAKE ME HOME stalked the
earlier pace two deep, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. NURSE TOMPKINS
settled off the earlier pace in the two and three paths, bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and ran evenly in the
lane. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG saved ground off the pace, started a bid at the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened. ZIG
broke a step slow and rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase past the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.
