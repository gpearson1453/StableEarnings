Footnotes
SLICK SILVER moved out to be three wide midway on the first turn, stalked the issue outside the middle half, advanced to challenge in the three path
second bend, quickly clear, kept to task. COAL TRUTH lacked speed well out in the strip, four wide into the far turn, rallied, no match, clear second. LOVE
NEST settled off the pace toward the inside, one paced into the lane while three wide, along for the show, no threat to the top pair. MINE MY TIME pressed
the issue off the inside, challenged between horses and inside the winner final turn, briefly dueled with that same rival then faltered entering the stretch.
CHICORY BLUE remained back in failing to threaten. IKE moved up to show the way along the inside, continued to set the pace into the far turn, gave way
when headed midway on that bend. FORT RIDGE off slow, trailed throughout to be always outrun while racing four wide.

Footnotes
LA FLECHA broke alertly despite bobbling slightly, tracked the two leaders along the inside, continued to save ground far turn, steered out sharply to the
three path with a quarter mile remaining, challenged into the stretch, shook clear, ridden out. REMEMBER NORMANDY pressed the issue up front in the
three path, dueled up the backstretch, vied between rivals into the stretch, proved no match for the winner through the lane, remained clear for the second
spot. NUGGET OF GRACE in mid pack and outside, four wide through the turns, mild rally, best of the rest. PRACTICAL MAN set or forced the pace
closest to but not on the rail, gave way in the drive. DUDE DROP KID broke back, lacked speed off the inside, dropped to the rail early in the far turn, picked
off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. MOUNTAIN PINE was never involved while racing off the inside. TIZ THE JOURNEY off a step slow, never
menaced.

ROCK STAR PARKING chased the early leader off the inside, moved up to engage that rival late backstretch, pressed through the bend, took over into the
lane, shook clear, maintained daylight under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. HEADLAND fell back to trail after the start, rode the rail through the turn,
steered out a bit when straightened for home, rallied from between foes to garner the place, not a serious threat to the winner. GHAALEB THE GREAT off a
step slow, moved out three wide, within striking distance through the turn, came up empty for the drive to be outkicked for the place. CANADIAN GINGER
broke sharp to be clear early, set a pressured pace through the turn, weakened in the drive along the inside.

Footnotes
CAIRAMA last away, moved up to a forward position before a quarter, challenged three wide midway on the turn, two path into the lane when showing the
way, drew out while only being shown the crop to win ridden out. PENETRATOR dueled up front while closest to the inside, proved no match for the winner
through the stretch, clearly second best. CHARCO fell back to trail after the start, remained back while saving ground turn, improved through the lane to be
clear for the show. SWIFT TAP in the second flight while in the two path, lacked a closing response when set down for the drive. PHILO BEDDOE dueled up
front while racing in the two path, gave way. JERRY'S EIGHTY remained back in failing to threaten.

Footnotes
MEGA MAX asked a bit from the gate to maintain forward position, patiently handled the middle half while continuing to save ground, closer rail late final
turn, tipped out for the drive, roused, slight drift, late push, up in time. GRAVES MILL ROAD forwardly placed three wide, took over far turn, clear past the
furlong marker, could not contain the winner. KNIEVEL back off the pace just off the inside early, continued unhurried second turn, came four wide for the
drive, rallied well out in the strip to be well clear of the others. GALACTIC EMPIRE fell bac to trail past the wire the first time, continued back, three wide
through the second turn, improved position while never a threat to the top two. PA MA'S AMOS four wide into the first turn, continued to race outside, four
wide again through the second turn, improved by passing tiring rivals, no threat. BOLD MINISTER last away, raced back early, improved with a mild middle
move outside, flattened out in the drive. HELLUVA LIFE broke sharp, pulled while attempting to rate while setting the pace in the two path, continued to
appear difficult to handle late backstretch, steadied when confronted into the far turn, fell back and did not recover. MO HEAT five wide into the first turn,
continued outside, gave way in the far turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
BRODY BOUCHER broke alertly, allowed the pace to go early, raced three wide and in the second flight turn, set down, responded, late bid, edging away.
GLASSATO settled off the early pace, rail bid midway on the turn, put a head in front late in the turn, shook clear nearing the furlong marker, could not
contain the winner. LAKE TAHOE lacked early foot, came three wide for the drive, finished up willingly to be in time for the show. DEMURO in the second
flight while racing outrun, challenged three wide through the turn, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. BON DEUX off a step slow, trailed early,
two path then angled out exiting the turn, improved position. THE Z MAN moved up to be clear before a quarter, narrowly showed the way through most of
the turn in the two path, allowed the winner the inside late in the bend, began to falter when headed by that one. CONFESS in mid pack well wide, five path
into the turn, four wide exiting, had little for the drive. RAZOR RAY off a bit slow, remained always back. GREAT AWAKENING off a step slow, five wide
backstretch and into the turn, faded to finish well back.

Footnotes
SOMETHING NATURAL close from the start, pressed three wide onto the backstretch, continued to force the issue in the three path into the far turn,
challenged and took over midway on the bend, drove steadily clear in the run to the wire. SECRETARY AT WAR also forwardly placed from the start, shifted
out and prompted the leader onto the backstretch, challenged inside the winner and between horses midway on the final turn, proved no match in the drive,
clearly second best. COACH ADAMS moved up to a forward position while four wide late in the first turn, continued outside, four wide through the second
turn, went evenly through the lane to prove no match for the top two, clear of others. CAN IMAGINE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside for almost
six furlongs, began to weaken when headed by the top two mid way on the final turn.. BUXTERHOOTER settled off the pace, failed to muster a rally.
STOCK DEAL last away, raced three wide throughout, remained back. KIERKEGAARD four wide into the first turn, fell back to trail, pulled up far turn,
vanned off.

Footnotes
BANDIT POINT off a step slow to be last away, raced back, moved out four wide second turn, roused, kept coming down the middle of the strip and widest
to be in plenty of time. SOUIXPER CHARGER broke alertly, clear into the first turn, set all the pace, continued to lead late, caught final strides, held sway for
the place. K J'S NOBILITY forwardly placed along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, brief wait behind the leaders turning for home, went flat
the final furlong when clear. SMARTY GRIMES chased the runner up to that one's outside, lacked a winning response in the stretch. MORE THAN
BLESSED went one paced throughout while in the three path. PROMISING SHOES fell back to trail, lacked a closing response as well. MAN IN THE CAN
off slow, moved up in traffic into the first turn, mid pack for a half then began to stop.

Footnotes
J'S LITTLE MAN with the early pace after breaking in good order, narrowly showed the way while three wide through the turn, two path into lane, clear, kept
to task. DUDLEY broke back, lacked speed while in the three path, angled in a bit for the drive, finished willingly to be clear for the place. KISSOFTHENILE
broke on top, fell bac off the leaders midway up the backstretch, four wide mid turn, three wide into the lane, chased the leader past the furlong marker then
went flat the final sixteenth, saved the show. MORNING DRIVE broke step slow, raced back, came three wide into the lane, widest late, some interest to
improve position. ORBITAL STARR with the early pace between foes, moved inside late turn in falling back, went evenly through the stretch. HOWL YEAH
void of speed, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. PERIPATETIC in mid pack well off the rail, four wide midway on the turn, tired through the
stretch. MY KINDA TETON flashed brief speed inside, was finished before a half. TAYLOR TOWN off a step slow, trailed throughout.
