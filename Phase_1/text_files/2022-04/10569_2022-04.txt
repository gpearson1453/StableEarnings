Footnotes
BELLA FUTURE broke to a clear lead, rated along inside to the stretch, and was kept to pressure never threatened. SWING LOW advanced four wide
around the far turn, and rallied with good energy outside rivals to be along for the place. MY BROTHER MIKE saved ground to midway on the far turn,
shifted to the three-path at the top of the stretch, offered a mild response but was outfinished for the runner-up spot. BIRDNOTE chased inside from close
range to the stretch, and lacked a solid bid. EMBER raced two to three wide, and failed to menace. STARSHIP WIZARD saved ground to no avail. DANLEY
pursued the pacesetter for six furlongs, and tired. CROWN OF HONOR was outrun two wide. IRISH KING trailed throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KING THEO prompted the pace two wide, reached event terms nearing the quarter pole, was floated about five wide turning for home, dueled outside of
ROYAL KITTEN to deep stretch and just held off the runner-up's late surge. SKYWALKING saved ground off the pace, edged closer between foes around
the far turn, swung out in upper stretch, closed outside and just missed. ROYAL KITTEN set a rated pace inside, drifted out turning for home, fought on
inside of the winner and was narrowly outfinished. KING CAIRO broke in a tangle, saved ground off the pace, steadied entering the far turn, continued to
save ground around that bend, tipped two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. CHAO stalked the pace from the rail, briefly angled out nearing
the lane, angled back to the rail soon after, bid inside of foes in midstretch then weakened. NAVAJO CREED chased the pace two and three wide and faded
through the lane.

Footnotes
MAP EM UP hustled to the front after the start, made the pace inside to the stretch, came out slightly under left-hand pressure 70 yards out and held on.
EMMA AND I moved inside early on the first turn, lagged at the back to the far turn, moved back outside for the drive and rallied to get up for second outside
rivals. DADDY'S JOY stayed in range two to three wide to the stretch, and was outfinished between horses. DOMINEERING pressed MAP EM UP from
outside, had aim through the stretch but could not get by, then was put in a bit tight by the leader and steadied late. LA RUSIA saved ground and failed to
menace. LUNAR BLAST was no factor. AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF DOMINEERING FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
IN DEEP STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
BATTER UP BUD prompted the pace two wide, reached even terms near the quarter pole, dueled outside of REDDINGTON from there to the wire and
prevailed. REDDINGTON set the pace along the rail, dug in when the winner reached even terms near quarter pole, dueled inside from there to the wire and
just missed in a game try. LEOPARDI was in range while racing three wide, could not gain on the top two in the lane but stayed on to remain well clear of
the rest. GLOBAL EMPIRE lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn and flattened out in the lane. STREET GLIDE steadily faded inside.
BOLD PLAY had some speed three wide but was through after a half. PITTSBURGH played no factor while racing two wide.

Footnotes
LINDA'S GIFT settled off the first flight three wide for six furlongs, moved out a bit wider for the drive and produced a good closing kick to overhaul foes from
outside and draw clear. THEREARENORULES chased two wide on the turns, and finished gamely between horses to get the place. MARGEAUX
ROMANCE sped clear after an alert break, showed the way inside to deep stretch, and weakened. BALI BELLE pursued the leaders three wide to the
stretch, and was outfinished. SCHOOL DANCE went along in midpack near the two-path, and lacked a rally. ORNAMENTAL was no factor inside.
STARSHIP ELEGANCE was no factor two to three wide. CUMULONIMBUS faded inside after six furlongs. ATHENAIS was never in the hunt. MRS
WHISTLER broke slowly, raced three wide early, and was always outrun. GRISETTE broke slowly and was far back throughout. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF AUDREY had her head turned at the start and was off last, raced well back two wide, swung out in upper stretch, kicked in, moved to the
front inside of WAR OF AGES near the sixteenth pole and held that foe at bay. WAR OF AGES raced off the pace three wide, angled six wide in upper
stretch, rallied outside of the winner and was outkicked by that foe. LOVIN MAKES CENTS stalked the pace inside, angled out and bumped ROCK ALONG
midway around the turn, stalked two wide from there, continued on the left lead in the lane, reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole but was no
match for the top two in the final sixteenth. ILLOGICAL LOVE set a clear pace along the rail, yielded near the sixteenth pole and weakened inside. JET
FORCE went evenly while racing two wide. ROCK ALONG stalked the pace two wide, was bumped out near the five-sixteenths pole, remained in range
three wide to midstretch and tired. BELLA SOFI was outrun inside. SIDNEY SUE played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
GREAT ADVENTURE dashed clear after the start, showed the way a bit off the inside early, came three wide into the stretch and widened under pressure.
OVERCOOKED chased two wide for a half-mile, moved to the rail for the drive and was clearly second best. KITTEN'S APPEAL was fractious behind the
gate, hesitated at the break spotting the field several lengths, put in a four-wide run on the turn, then weakened leaving the furlong grounds while swapping
back to her left lead. YOUR INHERITANCE gave chase inside for a half-mile, and faded. SPIRIT OF POWER was no factor three wide. DISCO QUEEN was
in a bit tight on the rail at the three-eighths pole, moved off the rail after that and dropped far back. SEA LIONESS was finished early.

Footnotes
UNO TIGER settled off the early pace inside, edged closer in the two path around the far turn, angled three wide turning for home, moved quickly to the
front and drew away. VOLIERO raced off the pace while saving ground, angled three wide in upper stretch and rallied for the place. BUENISIMO saved
ground closest the pacesetter around the first turn, tipped out early on the backstretch, reached near even terms near the five-eighths marker, dueled two
wide from there to midstretch, could not match strides with the winner from there and settled for a share of the show. BACKCHAT raced in range three wide,
bid three deep nearing the five-sixteenths pole, led to midstretch and weakened. DRILLOMATIC failed to menace while racing two and three wide.
ASTROTURF played no factor while racing three and four wide. SIX MINUS was outrun while racing two wide. GOLDEN INDY sprinted clear in the two
path, dueled inside down the backstretch and around the far turn and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
CAPTURE THE TIME sped clear with an alert getaway, rated along inside early, was roused in upper stretch and responded well to secure the decision.
OLD TOWN ROAD broke a step slow, recovered to race close up inside for three furlongs, moved out three wide at the top of the stretch, and finished
willingly. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT pursued the winner from outside from the start, could not mount a serious threat and was outfinished for second. MOGALU
raced three wide on the turn, and could not threaten with an even finish. TRIKITRAKI raced four wide around the turn, and lacked a rally. BRIT'S
CANDYMAN broke slowly, steadied behind horses approaching the quarter-pole inside, and had no closing bid. DUE VINI hit the left side of the gate and
was slow underway, and trailed outside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
MALRAUX set the pace in the two path and held firm under a steady drive. STAR WEAVER steadied soon after the start, raced well back early, advanced
four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and closed outside to just miss. CAMPEADOR prompted the pace outside of the winner in
the three path, could not seriously gain on that foe in the lane but stayed on to hold third. BACKWOODS BOOGIE saved ground off the pace and rallied
along the rail in the lane. FRENCHMEN STREET lacked early speed, raced two wide around most of the turn, swung widest in upper stretch and had a mild
rally. LIVING VICARIOUSLY was up close inside, steadied entering the turn, remained up close inside to midstretch and weakened. CATCHING FISH failed
to menace while racing three wide. GRAN MALBEC never threatened while racing two wide. EARTH tracked the pace three and four wide and came up
empty in the lane.
