JUST ONE TIME broke a step slowly while leaning a bit outwardly at the start, settled far back in the three path, got outmoved by an outer rallying BELL'S
THE ONE turning for home while awaiting racing room behind foes, swung six wide entering the lane to be outside of the aforementioned one, rallied well to
take aim on that foe entering the final sixteenth, bid soon after, and edged away in the closing stages. BELL'S THE ONE was allowed to settle at the rear of
the field, picked up stride in the four path around the turn, swept past foes while shifting five wide entering the lane, sustained her charge to drive past the
leading pair at the furlong grounds, inched clear as an outer JUST ONE TIME gave chase, dug in at the sixteenth pole as that rival bid, but was bested in
the late stages. KIMARI prompted the pace two wide and from between horses, bid turning for home, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an
outer rival at the furlong grounds, then by another shortly after, and chased the top pair home. LADY ROCKET set the pace inside of a pair of prompting
foes, dug in to resist her most immediate rival's bid turning for home, battled through upper stretch, but gave way leaving the furlong pole. FOUR GRACES
laid off of the pace three wide, and failed to menace. CILLA stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, but required rider's
encouragement to change leads at the three sixteenths pole, got outkicked outer rivals soon after, and lacked the needed rally to threaten. CLUB CAR
prompted the pace three wide, but faded while getting floated four wide entering the lane. KALYPSO tucked behind inner foes early on to stalked the top trio
two wide, but required urging to keep pace into the turn, then failed to do so before fading between horses turning for home. CENTER AISLE hopped at the
start while breaking multiple lengths slowly, saved ground off of the pace after being driven into the turn, and never got involved.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PAL sped clear early on, showed the way while unencumbered in the two path, was set down in upper stretch, responded well and inched further
away, then felt a right handed crop entering the final furlong to be kept to task before being wrapped up in the late stages. JOHNNY UNLEASHED stalked
along the inside as the clear leader's closest pursuer, but failed to keep pace with that foe in upper stretch, chased through the lane, and safely held place.
GEAR JOCKEY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, rallied to bid for show in the final furlong, but leveled off late,
failed to progress on place, and held show from an inner rival to the wire. DIAMOND OOPS settled far back in the two to three path around the turn, then
rallied between horses in the final furlong, but failed to reach an outer rival for show. THE LIR JET (IRE) broke a step slowly at the start while being last
away, took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. JUST MIGHT stalked in the three path,
came into the lane in the four path, but failed to keep pace with the top two approaching midstretch, and tired between horses in the final sixteenth.
BARRAZA rated far back in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and failed to menace. NATURAL POWER (IRE) was outrun. CHESS
MASTER bobbled a bit at the start, tracked along the inside, checked mildly while in tight quarters passing the five sixteenths pole, and faded through the
lane. FILO DI ARIANNA (BRZ) tracked two wide into the turn, then weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
ZANDON settled off of the pace three to two wide and between horses around the first turn, rated kindly down the backstretch before trailing passing the
half mile pole, picked up stride around the far turn, split foes three wide at the five sixteenths pole, bumped an outer TRADEMARK while tipping outside of
the leading pair in upper stretch, sustained his charge to reach those foes passing the furlong pole, and drew clear. SMILE HAPPY stalked three wide while
in the four path around the first turn, inched closer turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, took a bump from the early pace-setter while
forging an advantage in upper stretch, led as an outer ZANDON took aim entering the final furlong, but was outkicked by that foe at the sixteenth pole,
flopped back to his left lead while toiling leaving that station, but was a clear second best. EMMANUEL set the pace in the two path, loped along with a
comfortable stride down the backstretch, showed the way along the rail around the far turn, met SMILE HAPPY's bid entering the lane, bumped that foe
leaving the quarter pole, got headed in upper stretch, then passing the furlong grounds. GOLDEN GLIDER pressed the leader from the outside while in the
three path around the first turn, chased around the far turn while failing to progress on the leader, got outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, shifted
out after losing show approaching midstretch, and kept on for a minor share. TRADEMARK tracked from midpack two to three wide and between horses,
chased the leaders around the far turn under stern urging, shifted four wide to vie for minor placings at the quarter pole, but was bumped by an inner foe into
an outer rival while being outkicked in upper stretch. RATTLE N ROLL broke a step slowly while brushing an outer foe at the start, settled at the rear in the
three path, moved up outside of foes while attempting a six wide rally around the far turn, but tired through the lane. ETHEREAL ROAD tracked three wide,
lost position approaching the half mile pole, regained stride five wide around the far turn to vie for minor rewards entering the lane, but was bumped back to
his left lead in upper stretch, and tired. COMMANDPERFORMANCE hopped slightly while brushing the gate at the start, was taken back early on to sit
reserved along the inside, then took the far turn two wide and failed to factor. BLACKADDER laid off of the pace four wide, improved to track four wide into
the far turn, but weakened between horses turning for home. VOLCANIC stalked in the two path, but came under an all out drive between horse at the half
mile pole, and tired around the far turn. FENWICK saved ground off of the pace and tired.

Footnotes
TEMPER TIME bumped with rivals on either side at the start, pressed the pace setter from the outside, vied into the far turn, assumed command at will
approaching the lane, and drew off under steady hand urging. INTO VANISHING stalked three wide, was roused to gain stride into the far turn, chased
under steady urging around that bend, failed to keep pace with the clear leader while bidding for place in upper stretch, and claimed that position entering
the final sixteenth. FAMILY TIME set the pace along the inside, met the eventual winner's challenge with five sixteenths to go, offered little resistance
approaching the quarter pole, sustained his chase through the lane while vying for place inside of INTO VANISHING, but was bested by that foe in the late
stages. ILLIOGAMI bumped with an outer rival at the start, settled far back along the inside, tugged forward down the backstretch while racing in the bit,
tracked in the two path around the far turn, tipped to the five path entering the lane, then changed leads in midstretch before staying on mildly. SEMBLE
JUSTE (IRE) tracked four wide, but failed to progress through the lane before being outfinished for fourth. SHESA MYSTERY stalked along the inside, got
rank under strong restraint around the first turn, then chased two wide through upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, and tired. GOOD PENNY was
reluctant to load, laid off of the pace four wide, then in the five path around the far turn, and failed to factor. SUKI trailed along the inside, saved ground off of
the pace around the far turn, but to no avail. MICROCAP bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced in midpack two wide and between horses, but failed to
factor. REINA DE MOLLENDO (ARG) laid off of the pace three wide, and made little impact. TABOR HALL took the turns two wide while far back, and failed
to menace. CLEARLY SMASHING was outrun.

Footnotes
INFINITE stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leader approaching the five sixteenths pole, bid entering the lane along with an outer
ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS, dueled through the lane with that foe while exchanging brushes, and prevailed via a tight head bob. ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS
stalked three to four wide, bid entering the lane along with an inner INFINITE, battled grudgingly through the lane while exchanging brushes, but lost the
head bob on the wire. GALLANT GUY was bumped by rivals on either side and squeezed a bit at the start, settled far back along the inside, came into the
lane in the two path, moved up between horses in upper stretch before tipping outside of CITY DRIFTER in midstretch, and rallied to reach that rival for
show in the late stages. CITY DRIFTER tracked in the three to four path around the turn, followed a bidding ARTEMUS CITYLIMITS entering the lane,
chased the top pair through midstretch, but lost show late. SAVVY broke a step slowly and trailed early on, saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on
between horses through the final furlong. CHARLES CHROME settled far back in the two path, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up
outside of foes. A ROSE FOR RAVEN bumped an outer foe at the start, took the turn in the four to five path while off of the pace, and lacked a rally.
SOUPER DORMY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, and failed to menace. JOYFUL HEART chased from midpack along the inside, then saved
ground, but to no avail. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY was outrun. MOMOS vied two wide and between horses while under steady urging, but backed out among
those foes when floated three wide at the five sixteenths pole, and caved. CREATIVE CREDIT bumped with an inner foe at the start, rushed to set the pace
along the inside, but weakened to a pair of bidding foes at the quarter pole, and stopped.
