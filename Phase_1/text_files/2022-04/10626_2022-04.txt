Footnotes
KOZY'S WILDCAT showed speed, steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, eased out on the turn, swept to command in upper
stretch and drew out under steady handling. FIVE STAR PHIL saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail in upper stretch and rallied. RIDICULOUS
lacked speed, circled the turn three wide and offered a mild rally. AUCTION KINGDOM , outrun, was not urged the final sixteenth of a mile.
STEVETHEVANDRIVER sprinted clear leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail around the turn and tired the final furlong.

Footnotes
LINDROS had speed to the inside of foes then was drafted back after about a furlong and was content to settle in last while saving ground, came off the
inside gathering some steam nearing the lane, shifted out five wide soon after, leveled off under left handed asking in mid stretch, rolled up outside rivals to
take command inside the sixteenth marker then was going away at the wire. FRIGHTLAND , brushed at the break, vied four wide between runners into the
turn, dropped in a bit and gave chase as the leader cleared into the lane, came back on to threaten between rivals with a sixteenth to go, kept on willingly
but was second best. CLAUDEE BOY disputed the pace two wide between runners then gained a slim lead around the turn, drop in when shaking clear
entering the stretch, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, failed to contain outside threats near the sixteenth pole and weakened late. LUNAR DASH
veered out at the break, corrected and rushed up five wide outside runners nearing the turn, forced the issue four wide outside horses into the lane, gave
hard chase past mid stretch and stayed on with some interest. VOTETHEMALLOUT attended the pace inside rivals, eased back a bit nearing the lane,
came back out while pursuing past mid stretch and continued with effort between runners. RIXEY ROCKET flashed speed then was rated back off the
leaders, dropped back mid turn and came up empty. DOC ROCK broke slowly, hustled up four wide between runners soon after and contested the pace,
steadied when appearing to want to get out leaving the far turn, angled in but lacked a finishing kick.

EXCALIBUR settled well off of a contested pace while saving ground, came under pressure mid turn, moved up under a drive leaving the three sixteenths,
eased out, split rivals and took command soon past the eighth pole, kicked clear under left handed asking, switched over to his left lead with a sixteenth
remaining then was steadily hand ridden to the wire. JAMMIN STILL , with the pace under rating and inside a pair of foes, took a short lead heading to the
furlong grounds, dueled and gave way grudgingly. MUCHACHO MACHO disputed the pace between runners and under some early rating, held a slim lead
past the quarter pole, fought on outside the top pair leaving the eighth pole and faded. AL BROWN , with the pace three deep, failed to kick on under
pressure past the three eighths and weakened. MAMAIGOTTHIS broke in the air and lost his rider. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but no action
was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
NATHAN DETROIT , three wide the first turn, swung six wide turning for home, closed outside horses and was up approaching the finish. BARDOLINO
prompted the pace two wide, gained the lead in upper stretch, drifted out in mid stretch and finished gamely. ROYNE saved ground stalking the pace, had
room along the inner rail in the stretch drive and flattened out. ELUSIVE KNIGHT , in hand waiting for room mid way on the far turn, was behind horses in
upper stretch, altered course to the six path in mid stretch and rallied. AUDACIOUS QUALITY , four deep on the far turn, worked between horses in the
stretch and was steadied to avoid the heels of BARDOLINO when that one drifted out in front of him in mid stretch. NEOTROPIC , along the inner rail on the
far turn, failed to rally. PALACE SUPERNOVA set a pressured pace along the inner rail and tired in the drive. SAINT MARCO , four wide the first turn, was
not a factor. NORDIC RHYTHM saved ground on the far turn, remained along the inner rail in the stretch and weakened. COMMODORE PERRY was
outrun. Following an objection by the rider of AUDACIOUS QUALITY, BARDOLINO was disqualified and placed fifth.

Footnotes
WHERESHETOLDMETOGO relaxed well off the rail while stalking a contested pace, cruised up and bid four deep mid turn, took over soon into the lane,
drifted in a bit when going clear in mid stretch, was corrected with left handed asking, drew out and was steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards.
KARAN'S NOTION , unruly behind the gate, came away alertly and disputed the pace between runners, poked a head in front heading to the quarter pole,
drifted out to about the three path while battling inside the winner into the lane, steadied briefly near mid stretch, regrouped and kept on gamely to earn the
place. KADRI rated just off the leading quartet leaving the three eighths, swung out for a clear run leaving the three sixteenths, moved up with good energy
outside KARAN'S NOTION in deep stretch but was edged for second. EASTERN BAY dropped back early, was under asking mid turn, moved up near mid
stretch, eased out and rallied between foes. PICTOR broke a step slow, was sent up to the inside of rivals and put a head in front with four and a half
furlongs remaining, sparred inside runners from the far turn to the head of the lane, stayed willingly to about mid stretch and weakened. AMUNDSON , off
the pace and removed from the rail, was under a solid ride mid turn, angled wide for the drive but could only muster up a mild kick. HUNTER JOE had
speed to hold a brief early advantage, was displaced by two rivals to his inside, vied between runners leaving the three eights, failed to kick on with the
leaders in upper stretch and gave way. An objection by the rider of KARAN'S NOTION against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not
allowed

GOING TO THE LEAD , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, bid for the lead outside NOTTOWAY in midstretch and prevailed in an extended
drive. NOTTOWAY accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. DARK OAK , a forward factor in the three path
around the turn, failed to rally in an even effort. D' RAPPER lacked speed, swung to the four path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. JOVIS hugged the
inner rail around the turn and weakened. TOMMY SHELBY trailed.

Footnotes
BAZINGA C broke on top and held a clear early advantage towards the rail, was shadowed by CLICK TO CONFIRM leaving the five eighths, got engaged in
a duel with that one entering the far turn, lost command while dueling past the five sixteenths, came back to re engage leaving the three sixteenths,
reclaimed the lead soon past the eighth pole, kicked clear under a vigorous ride then held firm. SHE IS WISKY , between rivals prompting the early pace,
eased back off foes near the five eighths, dropped in to stalk, was under coaxing to hold position nearing the quarter pole, eased out leaving mid stretch and
made a game run between runners to nab the place. CLICK TO CONFIRM , four deep past the seven eighths, was guided inward to prompt the winner past
the five eighths, dueled around into and around the final turn, briefly went clear leaving the quarter pole, was taken back on and battled past mid stretch
though relinquishing command then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. CONTINENTALCONGRES , rank through the opening quarter while close up
and three wide, tracked into the far turn then chase outside SHE IS WHISKY around the final turn, shifted out four wide leaving the three sixteenths, loomed
but failed to seriously kick on. MISS CHAMITA dropped in early, had aim under pressure around the final turn but lacked a stretch run.

Footnotes
GOLD GUY bumped with TUCKER ROAD leaving the starting gate, was four wide on the turn, closed outside horses, bumped with THE LAST SCIP
approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. THE LAST SCIP , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch,
bumped with the winner approaching the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. A LOT LIKE XMAS worked between horses on the turn and in upper stretch,
lacked room near the three sixteenths pole, altered course to the six path in mid stretch and closed outside horses. HIGHLAND DREAM set the pace along
the inner rail and faded in the drive. GERRYS GEM , steadied leaving the backstretch, was well positioned in the two path turning for home and weakened.
TUCKER ROAD , jostled both sides at the start, raced in the two path on the turn and passed tired horses. BELIEVEINROCKNROLL , buimped leaving the
starting gate, was not a factor. BOWIE TWO STEP , wide on the turn, gave way. RIP IT , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced five deep on the turn.
LUCKY HERB , outrun, raced along the inner rail on the turn.
