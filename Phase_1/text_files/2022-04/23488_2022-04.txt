Footnotes
PRINCIPE D'ORO broke out and was away awkwardly but came out with the rest of the field, went to the front, angled in leaving the chute, showed the way
in the two path, controlled the action around the turn, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the
furlong marker, extended the advantage under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire while much the best.
MONTAUK POINT broke out at the start, moved outside the pacesetter when that foe angled in leaving the chute then stalked the leader, was let out leaving
the backstretch, chased in the three path through the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and safely secured the place while no match for the
winner. STRAPPED was taken under a tight hold early then moved out, tracked outside under restraint, was let out leaving the backstretch, chased in the
four path around the turn, drifted six wide into upper stretch under a left-handed crop then drifted further out and weakened but was clearly best of the rest.
BURGEE settled at the rear of the field, was roused while dropping to the rail near the seven-sixteenths, saved ground from that point into the stretch and
faltered. NOBODYRIDESFORFREE was hustled from the gate, raced just off the pace, passed the half-mile pole under urging, dropped back leaving the
backstretch then moved off the rail, went two then three wide around the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
MISTER WINSTON got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, raced four wide in aim of the leader before advancing to vie three wide
outside a pair through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command nearing the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper
stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. JERUSALEM GATES four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home and ran on to secure the place honors. MR. FIDGET seven to eight paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide at the nine-sixteenths and then to the two path half a mile from home, got placed to coaxing with
seven-sixteenths to go, cornered three to four wide at the top of the stretch and kept on to be along for the show honors. COACH BAHE broke out a step at
the start bumping MISTER WINSTON in concert with OCEAN DEEP, prompted the leader from the outside three wide down the backstretch loosely
between rivals, tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to vie for command through the bend under coaxing from the three-eighths, took narrow
command five-sixteenths from home before being headed near the quarter pole, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. TOTAL EFFORT showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from a pair down the backstretch, had those rivals advance and
clung to the front vying with that duo through the turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the front with five-sixteenths remaining, took the
inside route into upper stretch and tired. OCEAN DEEP broke in at the start bumping MISTER WINSTON in tandem with COACH BAHE, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GIRL OF TOSCONOVA stalked the pace on the outside under a snug hold, took the lead in the four path with three furlongs to run, shook clear inside the
five-sixteenths, responded well under the crop in the stretch and proved much the best under steady urging. I'M FINE settled at the rear on the outside,
moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the five path around the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second
best. FREDDYMO FACTOR brushed with a foe at the start, disputed the pace while loosely between horses, vied in the three path under urging on the turn,
dropped back late on that bend and weakened but earned the show. RAFFINITY lost her footing slightly at the start, moved up to contest the pace, was
urged along against the rail on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. MIA BEA STAR brushed with a rival at the start, was well placed just off
the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
TRUE EMPRESS five then four wide in pursuit, got given a sole nudge by the rider at the three-eighths and advanced on the front getting on near even
terms swinging four wide into upper stretch and seizing command straightened away, remained in hand as her nearest rival was all out, received one further
hand nudge by the rider nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear to the finish in hand to prevail comfortably on the wire. LIBERTY FLAME showed the
way in hand two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under threat for the initial time from a pair of rivals to her outside, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and was headed for the front straightened away, dug in all out under a drive latched on the leader to the eighth pole in stark
contrast to that rival's stillness, proved no match while chasing that foe home clear for the place honors. STEPPIN' HAWK four then three wide in aim of the
front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and dug in between rivals briefly until shaken off nearing the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch
and kept on to secure the show honors. MO NIGHEAN DONN hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. IMPAZIBLE DREAM coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the
seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
IRRESISTIBLE GIRL bumped soundly with a foe at the start then came in and made light contact with another rival, surged through between horses to
stride to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, came under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, disposed of BELLA DOMENICA outside the sixteenth-pole and
proved best under strong handling. HANDLE THE TRUTH was well placed just off the pace under some restraint, chased while moving from the inside to
the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, brushed with a foe while carried out some around the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the
place. BELLA DOMENICA settled on the inside of a foe, chased in the three path around the turn, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, fought outside of
the winner into the final furlong, dropped back while drifting out into the final sixteenth and weakened then was caught for the place but was clear for the
show. SABREEN bumped soundly with a rival at the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two path through the turn, pursued the winner
under a drive into the final furlong and tired. MIDMON bumped lightly with foes just after the start, dropped back while ridden along, went four wide on the
turn and failed to rally. APPRECIATE bumped lightly with an opponent shortly after the start, settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the three path and was no factor. STORMI CAT LADY dropped well behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in mostly the two
path, came three wide into the stretch, moved out under a drive at the furlong marker and never reached contention. QUEENTIGUA was urged along on the
outside, chased four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the stretch and capitulated.

SOUND MONEY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take narrow command
a furlong out, dug in to inch away through the final sixteenth to the finish. SIBELIUS hustled from the gate, prompted the leader from the outside four then
three wide advancing placed to coaxing to take command three furlongs from home, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was headed a furlong out, fought on inside until shaken off in the very late stages while along well clear of the rest and second best. LIL
COMMISSIONER six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to
five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and
got coaxed along with seven-sixteenths to go, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. SECRET RULES showed the way in hand just off
the inside under some pressure from SIBELIUS to the outside, came under coaxing near the three-eighths pole and was headed for command at that
station, tucked inside at the five-sixteenths and continued along the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish.

DREAM BIGGER chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the three path on the turn, took the advantage passing
the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch under the crop, responded gamely when challenged by the runner-up at the three-sixteenths, disposed of
that foe into the final sixteenth then powered away under strong urging. SUMMER BOURBON broke out and bumped with a foe, settled under some
coaxing, was roused while carried from five to seven wide on the turn, dropped to six wide outside the quarter-pole, gained to make an outside bid in upper
stretch, battled with the winner to the sixteenth-pole, drifted out at that juncture and proved no match while just able to hold the place. TALE OF MIST was
slow into stride, raced towards the back under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, came between horses late on that bend, swung seven wide into
the stretch, moved into third position before the furlong marker, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for
the show. HIGH COMMAND was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive while still on his inside lead near the furlong
marker, remained on his inside lead to the wire and failed to threaten. DEPUTY FLAG showed good speed and set the pace, vied in the two path under
heavy pressure from the winner to the outside on the turn, lost the advantage passing the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and gave way.
MACHO BOY broke a half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch
and came up empty. BANYAN BREEZE bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along on the outside, started the turn in the six path, was carried seven
then eight wide midway through that bend, dropped to the five path nearing the quarter-pole and had nothing left. NOT A TRICK bumped with an opponent
at the start, chased the pace on the outside, lugged out a bit while five to six wide on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
ON THE HILL broke in then hit the gate and was last to commence, steadied while in tight against the rail inside the eleven-sixteenths pole, steadied again
while in tight outside the nine-sixteenths then moved off the rail, shifted from the two path to the four path under strong urging around the turn, rallied five
wide into the stretch, closed strongly while still on his inside lead to get the advantage inside the furlong marker then moved clear, swapped to the proper
lead inside the sixteenth-pole and proved best. DANCING WITH RICO was urged along off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went four to five
wide on the turn, rallied to the lead approaching the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner inside that marker and was outfinished while just able
to get the place. RIA'S ANGEL settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and finished with good courage to
just miss the place while clear for the show. MISCHIEF MOGUL was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside from third position, dropped
back inside the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn, drifted in behind tiring foes coming to the furlong marker then checked, moved out around the
sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to
three path on the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, lost the advantage outside the furlong marker and tired. VINCENT was hard ridden towards the rear,
went three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten while reaching his best stride too late. KINGSTOWN bumped soundly with an opponent at the
start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and capitulated. TONALISTIC
bumped soundly with a foe at the start, was urged along towards the back, rounded the turn in the two then three path, swung seven wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. RED JET was hustled from the start then urged along off the pace, dropped back while inside to the two path on the turn and
retreated.
