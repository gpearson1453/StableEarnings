ROLL OUT Taken ahold of early to sit off lead, switched to three path and stalked into first turn, moved up to challenge lead at five-sixteenths pole, dueled
outside of rival from the quarter pole through the wire and prevailed under rousing drive. BAJA BRIDGE Stalked in two path early, advanced to narrow lead
at five-sixteenths pole, dueled inside through the lane but couldn't pass winner. FRED Sent and cleared to the lead, was overtaken at five-sixteenths pole
and weakened from there. CONFIDENTIALLY WHO Tracked in third flight, dropped back at quarter pole, displayed a mild re-rally in the latter stages but
was never a match to top two. MADI'S THUNDERBIRD In tight at the break and dwelt in preliminary stages, ran evenly throughout the race and never fired.
AT ADVICE OF THE STEWARDS, THE RACE WAS MOVED TO 6 FURLONGS DUE TO AN ISSUE WITH THE STARTING GATE.
