Footnotes
SYNC prompted the reasonably quick pace, lost ground to RIVIERA CHAMP nearing the top of the stretch, closed ground on that foe inside of the furlong
grounds, slipped to the inside for the final stages and made a late surge to prevail in a blanket finish. MR BOTANICALS was allowed to settle, was coaxed
along on the second turn while three deep, rallied through the stretch run and just missed for the win while getting the nod for second. RIVIERA CHAMP
broke alertly and was sent leaving the start, set reasonably quick fractions through the second turn, was all out under firm urging through the lane and was
tagged in the final strides for the win and place, while well clear of the rest for third. SALTO DE TIGRE was three wide along the first turn, settled off of the
pace while in the midflight through the backstretch run, was steered to the rail along the second turn and lacked a late rally. WOLF MOON WILSON was
unhurried in the early going, was three wide on the second turn and was not a factor. JUST A COMMAND settled off of the early pace, bobbled a bit
entering the second turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-marker and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
MAGIC TIGER settled off of the early pace, was roused four wide on the turn, made a good late rally in the final furlong and was up just in time to prevail.
PAPPY BOYINGTON was hustled early on then took back to track the dueling pacesetters through the turn, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch run,
took a narrow lead into the final furlong, edged clear into the final sixteenth and was nailed on the line by the fast closing winner, while clear of the rest for
second. SIERRA MELODY was asked for early speed and dueled on the front end with DARKSABER through the turn, was passed by PAPPY
BOYINGTON while still within aim leaving the eighth pole and was outfinished in the end by the top pair, while clear of the rest for third. DARKSABER was
sent leaving the break and dueled for pace duties through the turn, was confronted by PAPPY BOYINGTON nearing the furlong marker, relinquished the
lead to that foe and weakened in the final stages. BERNIE'S BIG BOY chased the pace two wide on the turn and lacked a late kick in the drive. TWIRLING
DERBY was away a bit slowly, lacked early speed and was not involved.

Footnotes
SAL N LOUIE settled just off of the pace, was shuffled back a bit entering the second turn and was steered four wide outside of rivals nearing the quarter
marker, was set down for the drive, came to even terms with the runner-up inside of the furlong marker, wore down that foe and held safely in the end.
NICKEL NICKEL NINE stalked the early pace three wide on the first turn, made a steady advance along the backstretch run and the second turn, took a
narrow lead approaching the eighth pole but could not hold off the winner in the end and was best of the rest. TALISKER BAY settled off of the early pace
while saving ground, was steered three wide into the stretch run, lacked a late bid but was clear of the rest for third. STRAUS'S PLACE pressed the
moderate pace, lost ground into upper stretch and tired in the late stages. JEDI MASTER broke alertly and was sent early on, set disputed fractions through
the second turn, stopped nearing the quarter marker, was eased through the lane and walked off under his own power. ROYAL JESTER stumbled badly at
the start, lost the rider and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND RULED THAT ROYAL
JESTER STUMBLED ON HIS OWN ACCORD AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH STEMMING FROM
THE INCIDENT.

lead in upper stretch and pulled away in the end. WHISTLER'S STYLE settled off of the pace while saving ground, was no match for the winner in the final
stages but closed well late to secure second. WARRIOR'S MOON prompted the pace through the second turn, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch
and was just edged out for second in the late going. HOLY ZAGS stalked the pace through the second turn and lacked a late rally. TORQUAY was forwardly
placed early on while saving ground and weakened in the late going. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) was unhurried on the first turn, advanced along the
backstretch run, pulled nearing the half-mile marker to come within aim, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TRIBUTE broke alertly and was sent from the inside to set the pace, was engaged by WIND IN HIS SAIL leaving the first turn and disputed the
pace with that foe through the second turn, shook clear of the pace rival nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper stretch, was kept to task
through the lane and held to prevail in the end. ENJOY IT STRAIT settled off of the early pace, mounted a three wide rally on the second turn, finished well
through the lane, could not reel in the winner in the final stages but was up to hold safely for second. YOU'RE THE CAUSE was allowed to settle early on,
was steered four wide on the second turn while advancing, continued that run into the stretch but was outfinished by the top pair in the late going. TAM'S
TIME was three wide on the first turn while stalking the pace, was steered to the inside along the second turn, was outkicked in the final stages but did offer
a mild late gain and missed for third in the end. SIERRA SNOW STORM was four wide while stalking the pace on the first turn, lost ground through the
backstretch run and along the second turn while three wide, the rider lost his crop nearing the furlong marker, and did not have a late response. WIND IN
HIS SAIL broke out at the start and bumped MAJESTIC LUCK at the break, recovered to be forwardly placed on the first turn, was a bit keen leaving the first
turn and went to challenge for the lead along the backstretch, lost position on the second turn and faded in the final stages. MAJESTIC LUCK was bumped
at the start by WIND IN HIS SAIL, was away a step slowly and was allowed to settle early on, was three wide on the first turn, tucked in along the
backstretch run to settle in the two path on the second turn and was not a factor.

AWESOME DUDE settled just off of the early pace while outside of rivals, was roused three wide on the turn, closed fast in the final furlong and was up just
in time for the win. MEET THE SHERIFF tracked the pace two wide through the turn, gained on GREAT STORY nearing the furlong grounds, overtook that
foe nearing the sixteenth-marker, took command into the final stages and was just nipped for the win in the final strides, while clear for second. GREAT
STORY broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions while on a clear lead through the turn, was confronted nearing the sixteenth-marker
and was outfinished in the final stages, while clear of the rest for third. EL TENAMPA broke in at the start, chased the pace from the inside and did not have
a final kick in the stretch run. LESSONS OF AUTISM took up in tight quarters soon after the break, chased the pace through the turn and lacked a late rally.

path into the second turn, rallied into the stretch run, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, took a narrow edge into the final sixteenth and held safely
in the end. MOUNT PELLIAR was unhurried in the early stages, maintained a two wide path through the backstretch run and into the far turn, gained ground
in upper stretch, waited for racing room nearing the furlong marker, angled out leaving the eighth pole, closed well in the final sixteenth and could not reel in
the winner but was second best in a good effort. LIL MIRACLE MAN disputed the early pace on the first turn then took back to press the pace through the
backstretch run, was asked for run leaving the second turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and gave way in the late going, while clear for third.
THATSABADBOY broke sharply and cleared the field into the first turn to set the pace, was well handled on the front end through the far turn, came under
pressure nearing the furlong marker and tired in the final sixteenth. BARHOPSKY stalked the pace from an inside position, advanced in upper stretch,
lacked room inside of the furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. SASSY EINSTEIN was allowed to settle early on, saved ground while unhurried

Footnotes
SPLIT ACES was away alertly and showed good early speed while setting the pace, was kept to task in upper stretch while holding the runner-up at bay and
kicked clear in the end. WEAR THE CROWN tracked the pacesetter through the turn, was put to firm left-handed encouragement through the lane, could
not reel in SPLIT ACES in the final stages and was outkicked, while besting the rest. DIAMOND WILLOW broke out at the start, lacked early speed while
saving ground, swung widest into the drive, made a good late rally and closed late to get the nod for third. TOO TALL TO CALL chased the fast pace from a
ground saving path, weakened in the stretch run and was just edged out for third. BLAZE OF DREAMS hopped at the start and was off a step slowly,
chased the pace four wide on the turn and did not have a late kick in the stretch run. TOM'S MOON lacked early speed, improved position on the turn while
saving ground and gave way in the drive. CHARLIE THE GENT was forwardly placed while tracking the fast early fractions three deep, lost ground in upper
stretch and tired in the late going. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was fractious in the gate, chased the early pace between rivals and faded in the stretch. TAP
UNION chased the early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and was not a threat.

Footnotes
GO THRU THE HOLE was three wide on the first turn while tracking the early pace, lost a bit of ground to the pacesetter on the backstretch run, quickly
overtook KEEP ON DANZING nearing the quarter marker, extended the lead in upper stretch and was clear at the end. UNUSUAL CODE saved ground
while settling just off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn, closed well in the final stages and was unable to reel in the winner in
the end but kept on to claim the place. DIMMI QUANDO settled off of the early pace while three wide on the first turn, slipped to the two path on the second
turn, rallied in upper stretch, was outfinished by the top pair but dug in late to get the nod for show. AWESOME CURLIN was unhurried in the early stages
while saving ground, was steered to the three path for the second turn, was kept to steady encouragement through the final furlong while on the left lead
and finished well in the end, just missing for third. KEEP ON DANZING broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was erratic and a bit hard to place along
the first turn while three then two wide, settled into the backstretch run, was quickly overtaken by the winner nearing the quarter marker and faded in the
stretch run. LYING GHOST was four wide on the first turn while stalking the pace, maintained position on the far turn while three wide, lost ground in upper
stretch and gave way in the final stages. TOM'S BIRTHDAY settled off of the early pace while three wide, gained ground on the second turn four wide but
did not go on with that run and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
BIGFOOT CITY broke alertly and was sent leaving the start, sped to a clear advantage on the first turn, was well handled while setting moderate fractions
through the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and drew away under hand urging in the final stages. LINFIELD was bothered at the start and
away slowly, saved ground in the early going while unhurried, mounted a five wide rally leaving the quarter marker, was no match in the end for the winner
but bested the rest in a good effort. UPO stalked the pace three wide, lost ground in upper stretch and just saved third in the final strides over an oncoming
rival. FRENCH GETAWAY settled three wide off of the early pace, was asked for run leaving the three furlong marker, closed in the stretch run and just
missed for third in the end. BIG CITY BANE settled just off of the pace while three wide on the first turn, was steered four wide on the second turn and
lacked a late response. GOING AWAY PARTY was forwardly placed, stalked the pace from a two wide path through the far turn, dropped back in upper
stretch and tired in the final stages. OUR EXPECTATION settled off of the pace while two wide and lacked a late rally. HONG KONG COWBOY was
pinched at the start, recovered to stalk the pace from a ground saving path through the second turn and faded in the stretch run.
