Footnotes
O'L RED showed the most early speed to gain an early lead about the two path, was roused briefly into the lane then kept to hand urging to hold a safe
margin. MOST AMUSING tracked the winner's pace three wide but lacked a closing rally. JOMO steadied from between rivals into the turn, dropped inside
then swung out once straightened for home but could not close the gap. GEE WHIZ WHO was along the inside and moved up without threatening. GAME
DAY DECISION failed to threaten. SLICK IT UP chased the leaders three to four wide and weakened.

CALEB ON THE GO hesitated at the break, stalked the leaders three and four wide in good position to bid through the far turn, put a head in front turning for
home and went well to the wire to hold safe. TOO MANY CAPTAINS was on a pressured lead inside a rival throughout, continued on well in the lane but
could not hold the winner safe. FOR REEL hesitated at the break and dropped back early, rallied three wide then could not run down the top pair in the lane.

moved up three wide into the far turn then could not get to the winner in the lane while clearly best of the others. OUR CLOVER GAL made the pace to late
backstretch out from the rail and weakened. SCARLETT O'HANNA lunged into the side of the gate at the start, stalked the leaders inside, angled out into
the lane and weakend. CRIMSON T. was not a factor. RUN BRINLEE RUN trailed the field, was eased into the lane and walked off under her own power.
SILENT SUNRISE pressed the pace to the far turn, pulled up in that bend and was vanned off. Fractional times not available.

UNTAMED MONEY moved nearest the winner through the turn but could not close the gap late. EUROROPER saved ground and moved up through the
turn into the lane and gained the show late. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE was in reach four wide but lacked a final closing run. HANNAH'S STORM went five
wide in the turn and failed to threaten. SISTER SHIRLEY failed to mount a bid three wide. TANGO CINCO made a brief early bid outside the winner into the

ALL FOR TRUTH showed speed four wide to the first turn then settled back to a stalking position, responded when asked into the lane and rallied outside
rivals to narrowly prove best. SENOR BLAIR settled in reach of the pace three to four wide, rallied through the lane and just missed from inside the winner. I
CALL SHOTGUN settled two or three wide in reach of the pace, rallied through the turn and continued to close from between rivals to come up short in the
blanket finish. LITTLE NO WAY tracked the early leader three wide, continued well in the lane but came up short as the field bunched at the wire.
MASTERFUL STRIDE saved ground to rally through the far turn then continued the rally in the lane but was outfinished for position. ROCKETRINGO
moved to the lead early, set the pace to upper stretch and had little left for the drive. STICKINWITHTHEGUYS trailed early and lacked a solid bid three
wide. COUNT N GOLD was not a factor and went five wide in the final turn.

STAR IN THE SKY settled off the early leaders saving ground, rallied inside through the far turn to quickly move clear into the lane and held the margin
under steady handling. UNPLUCKED GEM made the pace on a short lead racing out from the rail, could not handle the winner nearing the lane but held
clear for her position. ADD IT ALL UP bumped with a rival after the break, moved up inside to follow the winner but could not close the gap in the drive.
GLAMOROUS LIFE three and four wide, moved up into the lane but could not threaten late. NEBRASKA RED bumped with a rival after the break and failed
to mount a bid two and three wide. TAKE CHARGE PATTI prompted the pace outside UNPLUCKED GEM to the far turn and weakened into the lane.
COUVERTURE was not a threat. GOVENESS SHEILA was close up early, gave way in the far turn and was eased under the wire then walked off under her
own power. Six Furlong fraction not available.
