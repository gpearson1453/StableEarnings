Footnotes
H. T. XENA stalked along the inside, produced a rail bidin upper stretch, drew off approaching the furlong grounds, and was driven home to seal the deal.
YES TO MISCHIEF set the pace inside of a pressing rival, shifted off of the inner railing approaching the lane to deter that foe's bid, but allowed H. T. XENA
a rail opening in the process, offered little resistance to that foe approaching the furlong grounds, and held place. BELIEVING pressed the leader from the
outside, but was outkicked by an inner rival passing the quarter pole, then chased thereafter. CLASSY CHROME failed to factor. LIZY D was outrun.
MOONSHINE DREAMER never got involved.

Footnotes
DOUBLE CLUTCH stalked along the inside, rated kindly in the pocket around the far turn, smoothly split the leaders three wide passing the quarter pole,
shot clear in upper stretch, and held sway through the final furlong. GROWTH CAPITAL tracked from midpack two to three wide, shifted to the six path
entering the lane, rallied outside of foes thereafter, bid for place outside of CHASING THE CROWN entering the final sixteenth, and edged that position
while unable to gain on the leader late. CHASING THE CROWN tracked three wide, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid while being
floated to the five path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rallying rival in upper stretch, chased while gaining place entering the final furlong,
but was outkicked for that position by an outer foe a sixteenth from home. URBAN FOREST settled off of the pace two to three wide, swung to the seven
path in upper stretch, failed to truly progress while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, but changed over entering the final sixteenth, and stayed on
late. MAHONEY ROAD pressed two wide, bid turning for home, drifted to the four path entering the lane, but allowed a seam for the eventual winner to split
rivals in the process, got outkicked by foes on either side in upper stretch, and faded. TRULY MISCHIEF saved ground in midpack, attempted a rail rally in
upper stretch, but lacked a kick to produce a bid before flattening out in the final furlong. LUCKMAN trailed, entered the lane in the four path, and moved up
between horses in the final furlong. AIRSPEED VELOCITY took up between horses at the start, and never got involved. CAMP DADDY set the pace along
the inside, met multiple bids while shifting a bit off of the rail entering the lane, and weakened between horses at the three sixteenths pole. MIZZEN MAN
tracked two wide and between horses, but faded entering the lane. HE REIGNS saved ground off of the pace, but weakened into the far turn and was done
early. SPUNS SON stumbled at the start and lost his rider, then galloped around behind the rest of the field before walking off.

Footnotes
SHORT SUMMER DRESS prompted the pace-setter from the outside while in the three path, led leaving the five sixteenths pole as outer foes menaced
alongside, but gamely clung to an advantage from those rivals through the lane. REMAIN ANONYMOUS tracked from midpack, closed in on the leading
group from the five path around the turn while well in hand, bid four wide entering the lane, but failed to reach SHORT SUMMER DRESS in upper stretch,
and chased that foe home while being staved off. RECODED stalked three wide while in the for path, bid between horses turning for home, but was
outkicked by an outer rival for place passing the quarter pole, then chased that foe and the leader home well. HABOBANERO laid off of the pace two wide,
shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on. DANCE RHYTHMS moved about right before the gates opened causing her to be unprepared for the
start and break slowly, trailed around the turn before swinging to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up. VINTAGE READY set the pace while a
path off of the rail, met a trio of outer bids at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane. YOGURT broke a step slowly and never got involved.
BOLD FIGURE chased along the inside, but came under an all out drive to keep pace into the turn, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
UNDER OATH chased the top group from midpack in the four path around the turn, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to bid passing the furlong
grounds and drove clear approaching the final sixteenth. ARTORIUS took the turn in the three path while lacking early speed, swung out to the seven path
in upper stretch, rallied before flopping back to his left lead approaching the final sixteenth, quickened well with a sharp turn of foot in the process, and
surpassed inner rivals for place in the late stages while belatedly gaining on the clear leader. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY stalked two wide, then along the
inside into the turn, but lacked a kick to split top pair through a narrow seam in upper stretch, inched into that position in the final furlong after getting
outkicked by outer rivals, then edged show among those foes approaching the wire. TRUE JEDI pressed three to two wide into the turn, bid for the lead at
the five sixteenths pole before coming into the lane between horses, vied through upper stretch, but was outkicked entering the final furlong, and faltered
late. THE JUDGE AND JURY set the pace, met a pair of bids approaching the lane, dug in through upper stretch, but was no match for a wider bidder at the
furlong grounds, and yielded. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY chased three wide under steady urging, ranged up to the top pair entering the lane, but drifted to the
five path in upper stretch while failing to keep pace with his inner counterparts, got outkicked by the eventual winner approaching the final furlong, and tired.
DINI D'AMORE bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but faded around the turn, and sustained stride without re-rallying through
the lane. VINTAGE VINYL broke a step slowly, trailed the field into the turn, then moved up between horses entering the lane. STRINGS raced far back in
the five path around the turn, and was outrun. RIKIO bumped with an inner rival at the start, then failed to sustain position while tentative between horses at
the five furlong pole, dropped back, and made little impact. KANSAS COMET broke a beat slowly, saved ground far back, but was outrun.

Footnotes
LIMITED LIABILITY trailed around both turns, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, rallied outside of foes in midstretch to bid outside of FREEDOM'S
WAY entering the final sixteenth, battled with that foe while forging an advantage in the late stages, and prevailed. FREEDOM'S WAY tracked from midpack
in the three path, gained in the four path turning for home, ranged up while getting floated to the six path entering the lane, grinded away to take aim in
upper stretch, bid at the furlong pole, led soon after, resisted an outer LIMITED LIABILITY's bid entering the final sixteenth, dueled with that foe through the
late stages, but got outfinished. PLAY ACTION PASS laid off of the pace two wide, shifted to the five path passing the quarter pole, grinded away between
horses to bid for the lead among foes at the furlong grounds, but leveled off late. MERCI rated far back along the inside, attempted a rally in the four path
around the far turn before swinging to the seven path with many lengths to find, then chased while trying to match rallying strides with an outer LIMITED
LIABILITY, got outkicked by that foe while vying for minor placings in the final furlong, and kept on to miss reaching show. UNDERDRESSED tracked in the
two path before tipping outside of the leading pair down the backstretch, ranged up to make the first bid at those rivals at the five sixteenths pole, vied in the
four path entering the lane, led through upper stretch, but was outkicked approaching the final sixteenth, and yielded. SETNA THE WISE rated off of the
pace in the two path, awaited racing room along the inside around the far turn, then came into the lane in the three path, and stayed on through traffic.
SKYLANDER broke a step slowly, laid far back in the three to two path, moved forward in the four path into the far turn, but was fanned to the six path while
between horses entering the lane, and tired. BRIT'S WIT laid off of the pace in the four to three paths, and failed to factor. CHURCHTOWN stalked in the
two path, then from the pocket around the far turn, shifted to the three path at the quarter pole while searching for room split rivals at the three sixteenths
pole in hopes of bidding inside of the leader, but lacked a punch in the final furlong, and faltered. CREDIT EVENT saved ground off of the pace, cut the
corner entering the lane, but was blocked behind a wall of rivals in upper stretch, and was stymied at the furlong grounds. WATCH THE MUSIC was rank
behind horses early on, shifted out and rushed forward passing the wire for the first time, pressed three to two wide, vied between horses turning for home,
but weakened once put to tight quarters by an outer foe at the furlong grounds. LESSON LEARNED (IRE) set the pace along the inside, vied inside of a pair
of foes approaching the lane, but weakened entering the final furlong.

Footnotes
RATIONAL CHOICE laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the first turn, inched closer outside of the leading trio around the far turn, bid
entering the lane, and assumed command in midstretch. SOUTHERN PASSAGE trailed, took the far turn in the two path, improved entering the lane before
tipping outside of a pair of rivals in midstretch after RATIONAL CHOISE took charge, then stayed on to claim place leaving the furlong grounds, and proved
second best. MR. TIP settled off of the pace along the inside, attempted to gain in the five path around the far turn, but only managed to stay on mildly while
hanging on his left lead through the lane. MEISTER stalked along the inside before shifting outside of the pace setter around the first turn, pressed that foe
down the backstretch, vied entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer foe in upper stretch, and yielded thereafter. MARTINI BLU set the pace along
the inside, met MEISTER's bid approaching the lane before offering little resistance to RATIONAL CHOICE's challenge passing the three sixteenths pole,
and gave way. WAYAKIN stalked three wide, but faded between horses entering the lane, and hung on his left lead. SOROS tracked in the two path, but
weakened into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
EBBEN was unhurried early on, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the five path entering the lane then was darted to the inside once in the stretch,
made a bid from the inside, took over and inched clear and held off foes in the late stages. HERE MI SONG raced back early on, was in the five path
through the turn, in the seven path into the lane, made a bid down the lane, was under a long drive three wide late and did not have enough in the final
stages. INJUNCTION tracked the early pace, raced three wide along the turn, was in the three path into the lane, inched ahead near the eighth pole, was
under a long drive late from between horses and did not have enough. CANDY TYCOON stalked the pace early on, raced in the four path along the turn,
was in the six path into the lane, made a bid in the upper stretch, stayed on a bit down the lane and finished willingly in the final stages. SPEITFUL SAM
chased the pace early, raced four wide along the turn, was in the five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but hung in the late stages. FLAMINGO
HAWK was bumped at the start and raced back early on, was in the two path along the turn, in the four path into the lane and made no bid in the stretch run.
RUNWAY MAGIC was a tad slow at the break, raced in the six path along the turn, was in the seven path into the lane and weakened in the stretch drive.
BASQUIAT was never a threat. NEXT dueled early on two wide, was in the three path into the lane and gave way readily. SECOND OF JULY stumbled at
the start and was never a factor. THERIDEOFALIFETIME dueled early on from the inside, was in the two path into the lane and tired down the lane.
