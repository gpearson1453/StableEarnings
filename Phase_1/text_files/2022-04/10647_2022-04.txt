Footnotes
AH LEAH broke well but settled back inside of TAP N TWINE, was pushed along into the turn but nonetheless lost ground while appearing to climb,
switched out past the three eighths, began to improve position past the five sixteenths, swung out to the five path in upper stretch, rallied under a drive,
drifted out significantly late but nonetheless got up in the final strides. PRINCESS CONSUELA broke out, tracked the pace down the back straight and into
the turn, engaged outside of NAUGHTYNAUGHTY past the three eighths while racing in the three path, continued to duel outside of her into the lane, went
to a drive near the three sixteenths, was all out late, but could not hold off the winner in the final strides. NAUGHTYNAUGHTY bobbled slightly at the break,
was sent to the lead early, set the pace in the two path into the turn, was engaged by PRINCESS CONSUELA to her outside past the three eighths, dueled
on the pace from there, went to a drive near the head of the stretch, continued to vie inside of PRINCESS CONSUELA down the stretch, but hung. TAP N
TWINE settled two wide early, continued near the rear along the rail around the turn, was driven in the two to three path in the lane and lacked the needed
rally.

HARD LIKE HOLLY chased the leaders from the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole, cut to the inside with a furlong to go and gained ground from the rail to pull clear late. SHEZA HOOT swerved in sharply
leaving the gate, settled well off the pace for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained
ground on the outside late. JOY ENAMORADA dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn
and into the stretch, was caught with a furlong to go and weakened late. SURE SHOT ANNIE raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile,
began to move up while saving ground around the turn, was cut off and forced to check when HARD LIKE HOLLY came into her lane at the eighth pole,
switched outside and gained ground mildly to the wire from there. DANCING BARBIE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
battle while saving ground around the turn and gave way between horses in the final sixteenth of a mile. HOLD ME GIRL hopped up and was blocked
leaving the gate, trailed the field from the rail up the backstretch and around the turn and made no bid. AN OBJECTION WAS MADE BY THE RIDER OF
SURE SHOT ANNIE, CITING INTERFERENCE BY THE RIDER OF HARD LIKE HOLLY NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE. UPON REVIEW, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED HARD LIKE HOLLY FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED HER FOURTH.

CONTRACTION was keen to the lead early, took brief pressure from POWER CRY past the five eighths, briefly held a clear lead into the turn, was engaged
by W W KAN DO to his outside from the seven sixteenths, maintained a narrow lead in the two path as that one encroached, rebuffed that foe into the lane,
and kept on safe under a mild drive. W W KAN DO chased midpack early, advanced to stalk the leader approaching the half, engaged outside of
CONTRACTION from the seven sixteenths while racing in the three path, loomed approaching the quarter, was turned back into upper stretch, chased on
under a drive and held on for place. RENEGADE BOB settled at the rear, was pushed along with the rear flight in the five to six path on the turn, turned into
the lane while still in the five to six path, went to a drive in upper stretch, showed good interest in the final furlong and missed the place. GIVIN UP NONE
tracked the pace early inside of POWER CRY, settled back past the five eighths, chased along the rail around the turn, continued to chase in upper stretch
without improving on the top pair, and weakened in the final furlong. POWER CRY tracked the pace early outside of GIVIN UP NONE, advanced to briefly
attend the pace inside of CONTRACTION near the five eighths, steadily weakened in the four to five path on the turn, and continued to weaken inside in the

Footnotes
SUMMER BELLE broke outward and bumped MISS HIGH N MIGHTY in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the back straight, was pushed
along inside into the turn, was in tight between WANDA STRONG and the rail nearing the three eighths, got through to the lead between WANDA STRONG
and the rail and struck the front approaching the five sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch while on a clear lead, and continued to increase her advantage
under a mild drive. STARSOVERPARADISE chased at the rear of the main pack inside of LONGLIVEROCKNROLL early, was pushed along in the two path
on the turn, rallied between horses in upper stretch and chased on second best. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY was bumped by SUMMER BELLE in the opening
strides, prompted the early pace outside of WANDA STRONG while racing keenly, attended the pace three wide on the turn, was driven four wide in upper
stretch, chased on but proved no match for the top two. WANDA STRONG was reluctant to load, went to the lead inside and set the pace while prompted by
MISS HIGH N MIGHTY down the backstretch and into the turn, was engaged by SUMMER BELLE to her inside near the three eighths and was headed by
that foe approaching the five sixteenths, went to a drive in upper stretch, proved no match for SUMMER BELLE, and weakened in the final furlong.
FEATURED POWER settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, raced in the four to five path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.
LONGLIVEROCKNROLL chased at the rear of the main pack outside of STARSOVERPARADISE early, was pushed along in the four path on the turn, went
to a drive five wide in upper stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
LAVENDER EARL showed the way while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, kicked
clear entering the stretch and remained in command while drifting some in the final furlong. JIMMY D brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
raced in the two path around the turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the turn from the three path and chased the winner
home while drifting out late, the best of the rest. FIRST MASAMUNE brushed with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed well behind the field
around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the
outside. YOUR TIME'S COMING saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving
ground around the far turn and continued to tire from there. JUST GUN IT was squeezed back leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the two path through
the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the three path and was never a factor. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION, THE HALF MILE FRACTION
FOR THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

JETS A GINNIN was bumped by MOM'S RED LIPSTICK in the opening strides, attended the pace three deep down the backstretch, pressed the pace two
wide around the turn, vied outside of LILY'S WOOFY in upper stretch, responded when driven approaching the furlong marker and drew away. MOM'S RED
LIPSTICK was herded out by JOLINA in the opening strides and bumped JETS A GINNIN, settled near the rear early, inched forward past the five eighths,
was pushed along in the three path on the turn while in range of the leading pair, raced four wide into upper stretch, and kept on willingly under a mild drive
while no match for the winner. LILY'S WOOFY was sent for speed between horses early, set a pressured pace down the back straight and along the rail
around the turn, vied inside of JETS A GINNIN in upper stretch, proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong pole and flattened out late. JUJU'S
SPECIALGIRL chased inside down the back straight, saved ground near the rear around the turn, was driven inside into the lane, and did not kick on
enough to threaten the top three. GIRL NAMED PATSY settled at the rear early, raced two wide in the rear flight around the turn, drifted out in the lane and
lacked the needed rally. JOLINA broke outward and herded MOM'S RED LIPSTICK out in the opening strides as a result, raced between horses in the
leading flight early, was outpaced by LILY'S WOOFY and JETS A GINNIN into the turn, chased them in the two path around the bend, was driven between
horses from upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
WILD AMERICA led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn, dug in in upper stretch and
remained clear to the wire under a drive. WHITE LIES hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid
entering the stretch and gained ground late between horses to the wire. HONEY MUG pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, chased the
leader from the two path around the turn, and raced evenly down the lane, getting outkicked late. PALM COURT raced off the pace on the inside in the early
going, began to move up while saving ground around the turn, offered an inside bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch and
flattened out in the final sixteenth of a mile. MONTGOMERY PARK chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the
two path around the turn, came on again with a mild gain of ground in late stretch and was not a threat. SHE'S WANDAFUL raced in the middle of the pack
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and came up empty in the stretch. KHOZYS CROWN tracked the leader
on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and faded from there.
