JEEBAR was coaxed forward to dictate terms inside just off the fence, extended the margin turning for home, weakened noticeably and just lasted.
ABETEMARCO stalked four wide, was gaining strongly late but just missed. FLASHIN PASSION chased the winner three wide through the turn, was closing
could only gather up enough for show honors. SUPER HUNK chased in the two path and failed to rally. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT was outpaced early, came
out three wide late on the turn, failed to threaten. ATLANTIC FROG shifted in early up the backstretch, made no bids. IMAGINARY RIDE swung four wide
into the stretch and failed to menace. SAVED BY THE BLOOD was not a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
JEDI JENNIE was brushed and bumped a rival at the start, shifted in to the two to three path into the first turn, inherited the lead when a horse bore out, was
thereupon joined outside by a rival to prompt the pace, edged clear turning for home and held. DIXIE JEN broke a step slowly, switched out and advanced
outside foes four to five wide, reached striking distance but could not get past while securing the place. CAROLS BOUTIQUE was bumped at the start,
moved in from four to three wide on the first turn, raced mid-pack outside a rival going two deep on the far turn, kept on well in the drive. MS HIGHSPEED
settled well back mostly three to four wide, gained late. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC brushed a rival at the start, moved forward three wide to prompt the pace
heading up the backstretch, flattened out. PARTYATTHECAPITAL saved ground, made no late bid. THE TIME'S RIGHT failed to rally racing mostly two to
four wide. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T saved ground well off the leaders near the rail through the first turn, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
FEEL THIS MOMENT was carried out badly late on the first turn and early up the backstretch, took hold and shifted back in and was too far back to threaten
at that juncture. REAL ME bore out badly on the first turn. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
DOCTOR TINK stalked from outside, was carried five wide into the stretch, struck the lead a sixteenth out and edged away. SEEULATERGATOR set the
pace inside, drifted four wide leaving the turn, was outkicked. OAKES CROSSING chased two to three wide through the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch.
AISLE RUNNER saved ground on the turn and gained mildly. MAJOR DAYLIGHT chased outside mid-pack, moved in from four to three wide on the turn
and was never near enough to threaten. BULLY RIDE went four to five wide on the turn and passed tired rivals. DEL ARGENT broke a bit awkwardly, raced
just off the rail and was not a threat. DINOS DA DADDY chased briefly, retreated three wide. SO CAL MEMORY raced three to four wide and faded.

Footnotes
MADDIE POPPE was mildly coaxed to the front and shifted in heading to the first turn, set the pace inside on or just off the rail, held sway under steady
handling. REAPPEARING settled last but one, steadily advanced about two wide, continued to gain late but couldn't get past. ELDORADO DREAM stalked
early then edged closer to press two to three wide, had no extra in the lane. METAROSE tracked two wide and went evenly. SO ELUSIVE was within range
four wide, had no late kick. BELLA Y SOFIA saved ground early, came out five wide on the far turn and ran on mildly. INDIAN EXCELLENCE tucked in
behind foes two to three wide into the first turn, failed to menace. HOT LIL MESS broke a half step slowly and lacked early speed, came into the stretch four
to five wide and passed tired rivals. MISS BRIGHT TOWN was mid-pack three to four wide, came up empty. IM COMING OVER shifted out five wide into
the first turn, raced mid-pack briefly, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
IMPEACHING set the pace racing just off the rail, drew off when asked. RUN LIKE KATE moved forward three wide to pursue the leader, was no match for
that one, drifted a bit and lightly brushed a rival in mid-stretch, held the place. LATENITE SLEWZY bumped a rival at the start, settled three wide early,
made a sweeping move four to five wide past rivals on the far turn, was lightly brushed in mid-stretch and could not threaten the winner. EYEJUST
TOOKCHARGE was up close inside early, saved ground, weakened. REALREALGOOD raced four to five wide and passed tired rivals. RAISE OUR FLAG
was bumped at the start, raced mid-pack two to three wide, failed to rally. BINALLOVERDRINKEN broke in the air and very slowly spotting the filed about
five lengths, shifted in and advanced some two to three wide up the backstretch, ran on. ZIVA DA'VID was caught outside four to five wide on the first turn,
encouraged along up the backstretch to a more-forward position but could not rally thereafter. SEE YOU AT THE TOP went three to four wide and failed to
threaten. ROBYNS LUCKYLIZARD broke outwardly, raced near inside, steadily retreated, was vanned off.
