furlong. CHICKEN N BISCUIT settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MYBESTISYETTOCOME was never far
back, raced four-wide through the turn and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

SEVEN POINTS lacked early speed, circled four-wide to take command nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin and held off the closing PAYNT THE
KITTY to prevail. PAYNT THE KITTY bobbled at the start, dueled for the lead with STORM DREAM while racing from off the rail, angled out slightly into the
stretch and was gaining on the winner late. ALLIE R was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly. INDIAN
AFFAIR settled off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. ASEAAWINNER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. STORM DREAM disputed the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. CAROLINA'S DESTINY lagged
throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MOJAVE pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with THIRSTY JUNIOR and drew clear off that rival.
THIRSTY JUNIOR broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner late but held on to the place.
VALENTINE DIVINE was off slow, lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. GOT EVEN SMARTER settled off the
leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. KING LEBRON raced off the pacesetters early, moved five-wide through the
turn and finished evenly. REELFOOT lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. LIMITED OFFER was away in good order to
dispute the pace from the inside and weakened after going a half.

BOUNTY OF GOLD sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off with complete authority. GUARDING ELK CAMP lacked
early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. SWEET HONOR was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. OUT OF THE SKY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing
the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late. TIZ DONNA BELLA chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out approaching the stretch and
