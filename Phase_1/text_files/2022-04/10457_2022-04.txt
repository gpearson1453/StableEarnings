Footnotes
ZORB , with the speed four deep heading towards the half mile marker, dropped in a bit and prompted the leader around the turn, responded to left handed
rousing and moved to engage in mid stretch, wrested command heading to the sixteenth marker and drew out while kept to task. THE CAIRO KID vied three
wide between runners early on, emerged with command into the turn, cleared and was nursed along towards inside heading to the three eighths, came
under pressure leaving the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly. PEPE AND HEYWOOD prompted the pace inside a trio of rivals then was rated back
near the half mile marker, chased inside mid turn, shifted out three to four wide for the drive and churned on. CHARM CITY BAND disputed the issue two
wide between runners, eased back out the pace fray with a half mile remaining, angled out, chased four wide into the lane then went evenly in the final
furlong. CHAMBO , sluggish and under asking around the turn, raced about two wide into the lane but lacked a bid.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME , brushed at the break, quickly recovered and raced four wide and between rivals early, moved up three wide and took aim outside the
leading pair heading towards the lane, responded when put to firm asking, forged clear with a furlong to go and steadily widened under a drive. TITAN'S
WILL rated comfortably in a stalking spot off the rail, moved to attack past the three eighths, secured command into the lane, failed to contain the winner
heading towards mid stretch but continued on with good energy to be second best. JAYJAYDEE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside around the
turn, met a bid past the three eighths, fought back a bit past the quarter pole, stayed on to the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. FINAL SAY
edged up while saving some ground into the turn, shifted out for the drive, gave hard pursuit past the eighth pole but went evenly from there. CURLINGTON
lagged back, swung six wide into the lane, had some belated action but failed to threaten. LOST MY VOWCHER pulled his way forward about five wide and
outside a rival nearing the turn, chased three to four wide into the lane and faded. WHIRLIN CURLIN saved ground and came up empty. MOON LAUNCH
broke outward and failed to meance. COOKE BROTHERS , off the pace while well wide, gave way.

Footnotes
PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH sprinted clear leaving the chute, set the pace along the rail and drew away through the stretch while kept to his business. SERIFOS
, three deep around the turn while chasing the winner, failed to gain on that one while best of the others. GENERAL'S DUTY prompted the pace outside the
winner and weakened. SECRET SOULMATE lacked speed, raced between horses in mid stretch and passed tired ones. CURTEIS , along the inner rail
around the turn, weakened. HACHURE lacked speed, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, angled to the three path for the drive and gave
way. ESPRESSO LUNGO , four deep chasing the pace into the turn, faltered.

Footnotes
SISTER SUPREAM sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when confronted near the quarter pole, shook back clear after being set down
then held firm through the final furlong while kept to a strong drive. MAMA G'S WISH stalked the winner three to four wide while outside a rival, had aim
under pressure into the lane, kept on willingly and was second best. ALWAYS MIA prompted the pace two to three wide, moved alongside the winner
nearing the quarter pole, dueled briefly, failed to match strides past the three sixteenths then gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards. DRY WELL
drifted out at the break, corrected and saved ground off the pace, angled six wide for the drive and had some belated action. I'M GITTIN THERE , bumped
at the break, raced well back into the turn while three wide, was under pressure four wide moving towards the lane but failed to generate the needed
response. JUSTHAPPY broke slowly, lagged off the pace while saving ground, was under a solid ride into the lane but failed to rally. MISS CASEY ,
bumped at the break, rushed up between runners soon after, dropped in and chased in the clear, shifted out for the drive and gave way.

the turn and pulled away through the stretch under urging. CLOSERTOTHEHEART , bumped by LOLA FLO at the start, raced behind horses on the turn,
swung to the five path at the head of the stretch and had a slight rally outside foes. MARY JANE CHROME , inside horses on the turn, raced along the inner
rail in the stretch and rallied mildly. OUR SWEET PEA , well positioned four deep on the turn, weakened through the stretch. BACKSTREET GAL trailed to
mid turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. SPLENDID VIEW showed speed along the inner rail and gave way. EVANGELINE

Footnotes
GOLDENIZE broke a step, was rated back off foes near the five eighths, edged up in hand leaving the far turn, eased out and worked through a seam
heading towards the lane, eased out four wide, made a grinding run under left handed asking and nailed YO NESSROUNDONKERN at the wire. YO
NESSROUNDONKERN had speed then rated off rivals to track, fired through along the rail to engage the leaders mid turn, was roused clear soon into the
lane, kept on under right handed asking past mid stretch, continued gamely but was nipped at the line. GALLANT GOLD , a bit keyed up four to five wide
outside a rival into the turn, was fanned five wide into the stretch, straightened and continued willingly. MOCEPHUS dueled three wide outside MARYLAND
BRANDO, held a short lead leaving the far turn, battled on past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase of the winner from upper stretch to mid stretch and
faded. HAMPDEN LANE lacked speed, saved ground into the lane and offered a mild response. MUST BE LOVE bobbled at the break, recovered and
hustled up, prompted the pace four wide, failed to kick on under asking near the five sixteenths and weakened. MARYLAND BRANDO broke a step slow,
accelerated inside to join the pace fray, dueled two wide to the inside of a rival, was attempting to get out leaving the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
EL ZOPILOTE circled the turn three deep, drifted to the four path approaching the stretch, took command inside the eighth pole and drove clear. DIVINE
PROPORTION lacked speed, raced off the rail on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. ABHAR rushed to the early lead, set the pace
along the inner rail around the turn, lost the lead inside the eighth pole and weakened. TRADITION lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, angled out,
raced between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. THATS MY DUDE prompted the pace outside ABHAR and gave way in mid stretch.
SCORCHED BY FIRE , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, gave way. ZIP THE LIP , wide on the turn, was outrun.
