Footnotes
VIRGINIA FULLA , immediately taken to the inner rail after breaking awkwardly, remained along the rail around the turns, eased out to the two path near the
eighth pole, closed determinedly and was up approaching the finish. PHRA PHROM , three wide the first turn, sprinted clear mid way down the backstretch,
angled to the inner rail approaching the far turn, opened up on the turn and just missed under a hand ride. SUPER NECESSARY showed speed along the
inner rail, drifted to the three path turning for home and weakened. EXIT chased the pace, was fanned four deep turning for home and gave way.
AUSPICIOUS LAD , three wide both turns, retreated through the stretch. LIGHTNING LAD was outrun. ROLL ME OVER , outside horses early, gave way
leaving the backstretch and drifted wide entering the stretch.

Footnotes
FREE SQUARE , away in good order, hounded LANTAU from the outside, moved to apply more pressure while floated four to five wide into the lane,
straightened and battled from the three sixteenths, stayed on under strong handling and just got up. LANTAU took over early and dropped down towards the
rail to set a pressured pace, drifted out a few paths entering the lane, corrected and fought on to the inside of FREE SQUARE, sparred between rivals past
the sixteenth marker and stayed on valiantly while just missing. UNDER THE RADAR , well back and off of a contested pace, saved ground into the lane,
eased out with momentum past mid stretch and finished strong between rivals. SIMPLY VALID bobbled at the break, quickly regrouped to be forward then
eased back off the leaders, saved ground spying the duel mid turn, moved through along the rail to threaten in mid stretch but flattened out late.
AXXERATOR broke a step slow, raced well off the early pace, drifted out entering the lane and came up empty.

SUBJECT TO CHANGE , taken to the inner rail about a furlong after the break, remained along the rail, came out a bit for the drive and prevailed under
brisk urging. TOM TERRIFIC , in the two path chasing the pace around the turn, gained outside the winner late to just miss in a game effort. SPOTTED
BULL , between horses on the turn, raced in the two path in upper stretch and rallied mildly between rivals. TAPPIN FOR GLORY , no factor, swung to the
six path turning for home. POINT DRIVEN , steadied lacking room along the rail entering the turn, worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired
ones. JUST PICK ONE raced along the inner rail and weakened on the turn. AMEN CORNER , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way.
MYSTIC TIMES , four deep on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
SHINELIKEADIAMOND had speed and found a good spot stalking a contested pace three wide, responded when given her cue and bid three wide between
rivals mid turn, sparred to the inside of MISS COREY approaching the lane, wrested command from that one soon after, opened up under strong handling,
had her rider lose the whip past mid stretch but maintained a safe advantage while kept alert. FASHIONISTA stalked two wide behind the leaders, tipped
three wide nearing the quarter pole, emerged as the closest pursuer a sixteenth out and continued willingly while saving the place. LOOKING FOR WATER
drafted in nearing the turn, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, stayed inside and got through near the eighth pole and finished well. DAILY
PLANET , taken to rate, edged up while saving ground heading to the half mile marker, angled four wide for the drive and churned on. MISS COREY ,
bumped an in close at the break, regrouped and pulled her way forward four wide to stalk, bid four wide leaving the far turn, dueled on a short lead outside
the winner nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and gave way. GOGO CHANEL dropped back early and trailed into the
turn, saved ground into the lane then leveled to make a nice run through the final furlong. HARPER'S DO rushed up inside rivals leaving the chute and
gained a slim lead, dueled with DONNA LIRICA into the turn and to the three eighths, failed to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and weakened. DONNA
LIRICA bumped at the break, dueled two wide outside HARPER'S DO, held a short lead between runners near the three eighths, failed to keep pace into
the lane weakened. MY GIRL STEVE stumbled at the break, recovered to be off the pace and two wide, was under pressure leaving the far turn and gave
way.

Footnotes
NASHVEGAS , along the inner rail entering the turn, eased out to the two path approaching the stretch, was taken back to the rail approaching the eighth
pole, closed smartly, swept to command inside the sixteenth pole and drew out. SOUTH SEA stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, gained the lead
in upper stretch and was out finished. DEMO DOCTOR prompted the pace outside SEANOW and weakened through the stretch. SPITBALL , along the
inner rail entering the turn, angled out approaching the stretch, raced between horses in upper stretch, swung wide near the sixteenth pole and had a mild
gain. BRILLIANT CHASE lacked speed, raced four wide on the turn and failed to rally. SEANOW set the pace near the inner rail and weakened in upper
stretch. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN , four deep on the turn, weakened entering the stretch. AL BROWN was a brief factor down the backstretch.

WHAT DOES IT TAKE rated kindly while stalking inside, eased out leaving the far turn, cruised clear after six furlongs, opened up after being set down in
upper stretch, was kept to strong handling to the sixteenth marker then was steadily hand ridden to the wire. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME settled in range while
three wide, moved up past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from there and kept on willingly while narrowly saving the place. TEXAS BASIN , bumped
and squeezed back at the break, regrouped and dropped in to save ground, moved up along the rail nearing mid stretch, shifted out and came on gamely
while just missing second. INK settled well back into the backstretch while saving ground, continued towards the rail from there and had some belated
action. IMAGE MAKER was steadied off rivals soon after the break, pulled his way forward while saving ground past the seven eighths and into the
backstretch, took closer order towards the rail past the three eighths, angled out to pursue, failed to sustain heading to mid stretch and drifted out.
BOONDOGGLE , wide to clear, dropped in and set the pace, was collared leaving the far turn, chased into the lane, stayed on with some interest to mid
stretch then faded. BUGLE OF WAR stalked outside the winner, was under pressure three wide leaving the far turn, failed to kick on and retreated nearing
the stretch. AMENDED , two to three wide, was not a factor. POINT OF GRACE , four wide around the first turn, remained off the rail and gave way.

Footnotes
TREASURE TROVE broke a bit sluggishly, rated along the rail the opening six furlongs, swung to the four path approaching the stretch, bid for the lead
outside GALERIO in mid stretch, dueled with that one the final furlong and narrowly prevailed. GALERIO , along the inner rail down the backstretch stalking
the duel, eased out to the three path entering the turn, gained a three deep lead entering the stretch, dueled late with the winner and finished gamely.
MONEY RIDE disputed the pace outside GENTLEMAN JOE and gave way through the stretch. GENTLEMAN JOE hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace
for six furlongs and retreated through the stretch. CROUCHELLI , outrun, hugged the inner rail around the far turn. DIXIE DRAWL , unruly in the starting
gate, lost ground on the turns.

Footnotes
TIKTOKNAWAY settled three wide, moved up into the lane, bid between runners past the furlong grounds, dueled and got up late after an extended drive.
DIVINE VICTORY broke a step slow, edged up between runners near the five eighths, dropped in leaving the far turn, made steady progress into the lane,
closed in as his rider's repeated left handed attempts bounced off the inner rail, switched over to right handed asking to challenge inside foes nearing the
sixteenth pole, battled gamely under strong handling but just wasn't quite good enough. HUDSON CANYON cleared early, set a solid pace towards the rail,
drifted three wide in upper stretch, remained well clear under pressure past the eighth pole, was joined by the top two from her inside, dueled inside the
sixteenth marker and faded. BAD TEMPER , off the rail, offered a mild response and got past a tiring foe. SHE'S MISS ARTIE angled out early and moved
up to take a stalking spot, was under pressure pursuing into the lane, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and tired. LOVE DUST dropped back
around the turn. UNION BETTY edged up while saving ground early, chased to the far turn then faltered.
