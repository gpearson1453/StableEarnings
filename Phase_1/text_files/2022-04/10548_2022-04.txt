Footnotes
WILDWOOD SECRET broke inward, prompted the early pace, went for the lead outside WILDWOOD SICILIAN on the bend, battled that one through the
lane and edged ahead inside the last eighth. WILDWOOD SICILIAN forced in just after the break, soon had a clear lead, was challenged on the turn, fought
game in the lane but had to settle for second best. FULL MAGAZINE was kept close from outside, three wide on the bend, floated out further entering the
stretch, gradually drifted out but was closing in on the top pair late. MKAR THE FAST also crowded briefly after the start, raced in contention from inside,
was boxed in on the turn, angled out inside the final furlong, could only make up minor ground but was easily best of the others. KING TITO forced inward at
the break, pressed just outside MKAR THE FAST for three furlongs then began to yield. A BOLD RYDE was steadied back from crowding just after the start,
hustled throughout but failed to menace.

Footnotes
WAY TOO SMARTE rated from outside on the backstretch, was asked three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, responded to urging,
took over with a sixteenth left and began to draw off. HIDENSEEK SALLY fought for the early lead between rivals while hustled along, gained the rail into
the lane, battled gamely but did not have enough left. APOLLO U ANYWHERE vied for the lead outside HIDENSEEK SALLY from the early going but also
lacked the extra needed deep stretch. KIANA'S LOVE forwardly placed inside, altered out three wide when her path was taken entering the stretch and
failed to have the needed late kick. HOLD THE SPENDING jostled briefly with RUBY ROUND HERE at the start and was never a factor. RUBY ROUND
HERE jostled with HOLD THE SPENDING at the break and was not a threat in a ground-saving trip.

GREAT PLAINES was encouraged to vie for the lead from the gate, soon moved clear, let out leaving the bend and continued to draw off while kept to task
through the lane. LAYTON THE DAY disputed the pace briefly at the beginning, gave chase after that from just off the inside, took the rail on the turn, was
no match for the winner but clearly second best. THACKER FROMM chased from inside, gained third inside the last furlong then could only hold his
position. SWEET LITTLE RUE void of speed, passed between tired ones the final eighth. TEARS ON A RIVER was an early contender from outside but
began to yield on the turn. BONNIE DANCES stayed well off the inside most of the way and showed little.

RULE FOLLOWER hesitated at the break, was sent to steadily advance from outside, came into the lane from path four and took over with a sixteenth left.
MAJESTIC ATTACK vied for the lead outside GOLDEN LANCE from the beginning, battled through the stretch, lacked the extra needed in the late going
but pulled clear for the place. TIZRIK disputed the pace from inside on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, came off the rail some fore the stretch
run, lacked a significant bid but took over third in the waning yards. A MERRY HEART chased from just off the rail, fanned out behind RULE FOLLOWER
into the lane, made up minor ground late and finished on even terms with GOLDEN LANCE. GOLDEN LANCE displayed early speed between rivals, gained
the rail on the bend then flattened out the final furlong. BUBBA CABALLO stayed well off the inside taking the turn and had no late bid.

Footnotes
BLAZEN ROAD shared the lead outside INSIDE THE CIRCLE from the start, responded to urging in the lane, took over with a sixteenth left then began to
draw off. INSIDE THE CIRCLE contested the pace from inside, edged ahead upper stretch but began to wear down the final sixteenth.
AHEADOFTHEGAME broke inward then jostled several time s with WILLIE ATTACK on the backstretch, saved ground taking the turn, rallied in the stretch,
altered out three wide with a furlong to go and was closing in on the top pair late. BRIANS WAY in the second flight between horses, threatened two wide on
the bend, fanned out to path four entering the lane and failed to have a significant response. LUKE ATTACK hesitated at the break, picked up his pace from
inside on the turn, fanned three wide for the drive and improved position without threatening. DARREN'S LEGACY chased from outside, angled in with a
quarter mile to go and had no late bid. SNOOZER also broke inward, raced in the second flight between foes, was three to five wide taking the bend and
also had little to offer for the stretch run. WILLIE ATTACK was forced inward at the break, jostled several times with AHEADOFTHEGAME, steadily yielded
and was allowed to coast through the lane.

SAY CHEESE well placed inside from the beginning, commenced her bid on the turn, engaged SACRED STORM from inside in the lane and edged ahead
late. SACRED STORM forwardly placed between horses, took over two wide on the bend, was challenged in the stretch and slowly yielded in the waning
yards. PALAGO well back early, lost considerable ground widest through the turn, surged through the lane, came up short but was clearly best of the rest. U
CAN DO IT raced in contention from outside, took the bend three wide and gradually wore down for the drive. ENGLISH failed to menace in a ground-saving
trip. LIPLINER displayed early speed from inside but began to wear down before finishing three furlongs.

Footnotes
NEXT TIME YOU WIN bumped with ATLANTIS ALANA at the start then was steadied behind TOUCH BY FELICTY, settled, progressed just off the inside
on the turn, altered out five wide upper stretch, was all out and got up in time. TIME BREAK without early speed, progressed from inside on the bend, split
rivals two wide upper stretch to vie for the lead inside TOUCH BY FELICTY, edged ahead with a sixteenth left but was outfinished in a game effort. TOUCH
BY FELICTY forwardly placed, advanced just off the rail on the turn, swung four wide for the stretch run, soon took a slight advantage but gradually wore
down between horses in the late going. ABBMAR displayed early speed outside HEART OF REASON but gave way between rivals the last two furlongs.
BULU failed to menace in a wide trip. MAJESTIC RAJ was an early contender but faded three wide on the bend. ATLANTIS ALANA bumped from both
sides at the start, soon trailed, saved ground and showed little. HEART OF REASON quickly recovered from bumping solidly with ATLANTIS ALANA at the
start, disputed the pace from inside but steadily gave way through the lane. Due to a timer malfunction, the race was hand timed.
