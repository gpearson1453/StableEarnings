Footnotes
ALPHA QUEUE took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, was given some rein nearing the three eighths pole, widened at the rail on the far turn
and proved much the best to win handily. VOLTAMOUR settled off the rail, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn and was good enough to save second. GHOST ON A MISSION saved ground off the pace, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled back about the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but
flattened in the three path of the far turn. DUNLUCE CAISSLE saved early ground and showed little response. LOOKIN' SMART rated off the early pace
about the three path, closed toward contention nearing the second turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded past the three eighths.

Footnotes
FAST LOADED saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole but lost momentum off the heels of rivals through the far turn, came between
horses leaving the eighth pole, dug in for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and widened the final yards. MINE TO HOLD saved ground on the first turn, bid
toward the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then dug in from the head of the lane to take the nod for second under the wire. SCOTTSDALE
was bumped lightly at the break then angled in and took the lead into the first turn, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, contested the
advantage nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught inside the sixteenth pole then nipped from second under the wire. MEGA MILLIONS saved early
ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, eased to the outside leaving the turn and finished well widest.
SHERIFF CHIP raced with the early pace two deep then gave chase past the half mile pole, raced close two deep on the far turn, drifted leaving the turn
and flattened the final furlong. MOSS BOSS came out to make contact with Scottsdale at the break then settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the
chase from the three eighths pole, raced close in the four path of the far turn, was carried out leaving the turn and flattened in the lane. FRANKEE MERCH
saved ground racing well off the pace, rounded the far turn at the rail and closed the gap in the lane.
