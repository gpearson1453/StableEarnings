Footnotes
MIKE J vied for the early lead, dueled early at the head of the stretch, pulled away down the lane and finished well. XANTHUS WRATH void of early speed,
made a late wide rally, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FAMOUS YANKEE dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn
and lacked a late kick. ENCHANTED MOON challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout and weakened down the stretch. BERNIE
SPECIAL raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. JACKIE MOON raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and faded.
MR. CURLIN always raced near the back and showed little. OAK HILL LG raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside and dropped
back.

RELAX TOWN vied for the early lead, drove clear around the turn, was all out and held on for the win. WITCH DOCTOR lacked early speed, made a steady
gain, rallied wide down the lane and needed more ground. UNDERDOG raced near the middle of the field, made a late bid and was outfinished for second.
YES BAB unhurried in the beginning, moved up, challenged for the lead and hung. HONORARIAN was an early factor, forwardly placed throughout and
weakened down the final stretch. FREUDIAN SIP raced in the middle of the pack and put forth an even effort. SUCH raced in the middle of the field,
weakened, finished wide and went to the wire evenly. FLASH ME BACK pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn and faded. BROAD DECISION
void of early speed and showed little. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT flashed early speed and dropped back. PERFECT MISTAKE always raced near the and was
outrun.
