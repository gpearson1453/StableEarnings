Footnotes
HANDY HANNON showed speed inside LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT, lugged in early backstretch to nearly hit the rail and was snatched up, rallied back inside
and edged clear late. FOR REEL bumped with a rival at the start, moved up two wide in the far turn, angled out in the lane rallied clear for the place.
LIMPERHOME moved up three wide to bid outside the winner into the far turn and could not sustain the run. DIAMANTE JOSE prompted the pace outside
the winner then checked from between rivals into the far turn and weakened. LUCKY LIQUOR SHOT broke inward to bump with a rival, stalked the leaders
two to three wide and tired. BER MIS BOY was not a factor. P R STREAKIN was always back.

Footnotes
UNSOLVED stalked the early leaders from along the inside, moved to challenge through the far turn then continued determinedly in the lane to wear down
HOT ARTIE and be up in time. HOT ARTIE was on the pace about the two or three path, dug in when challenged but could not hold the winner safe late.
WILDCAT NATION bobbled at the break to get away awkwardly, followed the pace three and four wide then made a mild bid through the lane. BORN TO
RACE lacked a rally racing out from the rail. ROYAL OUTLAW prompted the pace outside HOT ARTIE to the far turn and weakened. BREWSTER trailed
four wide.

down the winner. DRYSPELL dueled on the lead inside HALEY'S STEELMAN while out from the rail and weakened some into the lane. HALEY'S
STEELMAN dueled on the lead outside DRYSPELL and weakened in the lane. WACO KID failed to mount a rally three wide. FIFTYSHADESOPURPLE

STAR IN THE SKY saved ground while trailing early, rallied through the far turn while angling three wide into the lane then continued to angle out and ran
down the leaders late. FIVE ROSES LUNA saved ground off the early, moved closer going to the far turn, continued the rally into the lane and split foes late
to gain the place. GUAPA CHICA was near the pace racing out from the rail and could not hold position late. STUNTING contested the early lead three or
four wide to edge clear going up the backstretch, continued to upper stretch and came up empty late. ZIPPORAH settled off the lead pack three wide and
lacked a closing bid. LEMONS IS GONE showed early foot between rivals and dropped back going up the backstretch. AMERICAN REALITY was angled
out early and never threatened.

LAURIEANN was on the pace out from the rail while inside SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS early, shook off a challenge from BLINKERS into the far turn to kick
clear nearing the lane and drew off under steady hnadling. BLINKERS moved two and three wide to bid outside the winner into the far turn then could not go
with that one the remainder. FIRST ALTERNATE stalked the leaders three and four wide in reach but lacked a final closing bid and saved the show late.
FRENCH ROSE failed to mount a serious bid three wide. A BUNCH FOR LUNCH was always back. SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS showed speed outside the
winner and tired after a half.

the pace three and four wide to bid through the far turn and show in front turning for home then could not contain the winner late. POSEIDON'S MAGIC was
on the pace out from the rail to late in the far turn and came up empty in the drive. ULTRA CORDIAL followed the pace four wide and lacked a final closing
run. LASTING INFLUENCE floated out in the first turn, settled three wide and had no rally. THEWHISKEYWORKED tucked inside going to the first turn and
never threatened. CHIEFTESS showed some early foot three wide and tired. POLLY WAR CRY bobbled at the break and was always back.

Footnotes
SUBSCRIPTION was on the pace out from the rail while pressed throughout, dug in through the lane and edged clear through deep stretch. DOWNTOWN
BROWN stalked the pace from along the inside, moved out to bid three wide outside the winner in the far turn then could not go with that one late. FULL
THROTTLE broke into the side of the gate then came outward to get away very slowly, moved up inside with a bid in the far turn but weakened. BRO CODE
moved up three wide but could not threaten. PERVASIVE was always back four and five wide. ATWATER contested the early pace between rivals and tired.
RHETTROACTIVE was with the early leaders three to four wide and tired. CARIOCA was always back.
