Footnotes
CHASING SHADOWS outrun early outside, raced four wide through the turn, set down when straightened for home, closed with good resolve to be up in
time. FIFTH RISK prompted the issue from the outside up the backstretch, three wide into the turn, challenged outside the leader turning for home, put a
head in front upper stretch, continued to lead until late, could not contain the winner. MY CORALENA in mid pack early inside, checked up in tight quarters
early in the turn, steered out sharply to be four wide entering the stretch, staged a mild rally to be up for the show. DIXIE PENNY moved up to show the way
after the start, disposed of the other speed entering the turn, briefly responded and dueled with the winner into the lane then began to weakened when
headed. CYPRESS QUEEN forwardly placed for a half while racing in the two path, came up empty for the drive. DARLING JOANNA lacked speed, was
never dangerous while racing in the three path. LITTLE BIRD FLASH lacked speed, dropped inside early in the turn, improved slightly while also making
little impact. IMPULSUS last to leave, in a bit tight along the inside early in the turn, moved out for the drive, passed a couple of tiring rivals after the issue
had been decided. MADISONIAN in the second flight early outside, steadily tired while four wide out of the turn. KNIGHT'S HONOR flashed brief speed
along the inside, backed up.

Footnotes
HARRY forwardly placed up the backstretch while widest of the first flight, continued to race four wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, dueled
through upper stretch, drew clear the final furlong under steady handling. TAKE NO PRISONERS prompted the pace three wide, between foes and inside
the winner when moving with that one toward the fore late in the turn, dueled through upper stretch then could not keep pace, clearly second best.
PROJECT THUNDER hesitated break, moved out, advanced four wide through the turn, well clear of the others while no match for the top two. MOUNTAIN
PINE off a step slow, raced out to five wide through the turn, improved position with some late interest down the middle of the strip. MR FROST went one
paced while racing three wide, lacked a closing punch. DREAMER'S DELIGHT saved ground to no avail. PIKACHU off a step slow, also raced inside,
passed a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. WORTHTHEMONEY broke alertly, set the pace along the inside up the backstretch and
into the turn, faltered when headed not long after. WILDCAT HAGRID was finished early while racing three wide. GOOD BYE CHARLIE closest to the
leader up the backstretch, challenged that one early in the turn, offered little resistance to the top two soon after then stopped in the drive.

TIMES UNION back off the pace while three wide, lugged in midstretch, was straightened to finish up willingly and be up in time. SINNER'S SIN moved up
to take control soon after the start, remained clear into the stretch, led until late, caught. FELICIANO off slowly, trailed while racing three wide into and
through the turn, widest in the drive, finished willingly to miss the place. SUPPRESSOR closest to the runner up while outside that one, continued in pursuit
into and through upper stretch, not enough late. GRAPNEL came in soon after the start to bother VOBISCUM, raced back and in the two path, in some
traffic late turn, failed to rally when clear for the drive. ALPHA WHISKEY forwardly placed while four wide into the turn, tired through the lane. VOBISCUM
off slow, bothered early when floated into the gap, lacked a closing response inside.

Footnotes
STORMIN HONGKONG in the second flight outside, raced four out to five wide turning for home, late surge to be up in time. TKOTCHKE prompted the
pace off the inside, pressed three wide turn, stretch duel, outkicked for the win late while proving game for the place. ABDAN broke alertly, cleared soon
after break, dueled out of the turn and through much of the stretch, also failed to contain the winner in the final strides, outkicked for the place. AMERICAN
UNION in mid pack while three wide early, dropped in a bit to be in the two path turning for home, chased the top three past the furlong marker and could
make no progress on that trio in the late going. MAJOR ATTRACTION chased the early leader off the inside, angled out four wide into the lane, weakened
drive. TIZ SHOWBIZ broke back, lacked early foot, improved position into the lane while off the inside, flattened. POP'S BISCUIT asked early but was
unable to strike a forward position inside, continued to save ground through the turn, made little impact through the lane. JINGLE broke back, lacked speed,
improved position while not posing a serious threat. GAINER last away, remained always back. TORIN in the second flight early, began a steady retreat
before a half. BLUERIDGE TRAVELER in mid pack for a half, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA broke out and was a bit rank, quickly straightened to show the way past the wire the first time, clear in the first turn in the two path, continued to
set an uncontested pace the middle half, remained off the rail in the second turn, shaken up when straightened for home, roused with a right handed crop
soon after, drifted, held late under continued steady handling. CLAIRIERE last away, settled well off the pace in the two path, continued off the inside into
the far turn, called on for some run into the lane, in an all out drive past the furlong marker, finished up willingly to be slowly getting to the winner late. CE CE
away in good order, raced off the pace in the three path, moved closer outside the winner turning for home, bothered slightly as that one drifted out nearing
the furlong grounds, was flat late in lacking a closing punch, outkicked for the place. MARACUJA lacked speed while saving ground through the first turn,
came three wide out of the final turn, posed zero threat to the top three in the run to the wire. MISS IMPERIAL broke sharp from between horses,
relinquished the early advantage to the winner soon after, chased that one the middle four furlongs then stopped through the stretch, jogged in.

Footnotes
CALL OF HONOR closest to the leader off the inside, continued to chase in the run up the backstretch, collared that rival midway on the second turn, shook
clear maintained daylight through the lane under steady handling. SLICK SILVER in the second flight in the three path, in tight, steadied to lose some
position far turn, continued in traffic late in that bend, finished up willingly when clear for the drive. RIVER ECHO (GB) lacked early foot, continued back into
the far turn, two path and in traffic with just over a quarter remaining, angled out four wide for the drive, displayed some late interest to be up for the show.
HONORARY DEGREE in mid pack while racing three wide through the first turn, continued with the main body into the far bend, traffic, improved to race
closest to the winner past the furlong marker, flattened out to lose a couple of positions late. FUTILE void of speed, shuffled rail second turn, steered out
four wide immediately thereafter, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. EAGLE PASS fell back after breaking in good order, four wide
first turn, continued outside, four wide again when moving a bit closer in the far bend, weakened in the drive. VERRAZANO FIRST sprinted well clear the
opening quarter, attempted to rate in the run up the backstretch, gave way readily when confronted by the winner second turn. GENERATOR was through
early, fell further and further back, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
RAYMOND steadied early to shuffled back, continued to be outrun into the turn, advanced through the turn, steered out to split foes three wide turning for
home, vied past the furlong marker then drove clear under firm handling. MEAN JAKEY in mid pack early in the two path, closer in the turn, challenged in
upper stretch, between foes past the furlong marker and inside the winner, could not match that one to the wire, held sway for the place. TONKA WARRIOR
lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground while behind traffic late in the turn, angled out sharply to be five wide into the lane, late energy to be clear
for the show spot. PLAUSIBLE DENILE void of speed, came in the two path while still well back into the lane, steered out steadily to be widest the final
furlong, improved position. ROYAL CONSORT broke sharp, sprinted clear, set the pace for a half, gave way when headed by the top two nearing the
furlong grounds. PORTSMOUTH within striking distance well off the inside, three wide through the turn, lacked a kick in the drive. ACEHIGH ROYAL four
wide through the turn when with the main body, had little left for the stretch run. MUMAYAZ forwardly placed for a half, backed up through the stretch.
OVERSLEPT off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
HOME BREW stalked the pace three wide, closer far turn, challenged three wide midway on the bend, put a head in front turning for home, lugged out then
in past the furlong marker, held the runner up comfortably safe late under firm handling. KUCHAR last away, moved up to set a soft pace along the inside,
responded second turn, held stubbornly for the place while drifted out a bit late under a brisk left handed crop. HAPPY BOY ROCKET chased the runner up
from the two path, challenged between foes and inside the winner second turn, gradually weakened through the lane, comfortably saved the show.
CLANCY'S PISTOL settled off the inside, raced three wide through the final turn, lacked a serious closing response. STELLAR TAP within striking distance
while saving all the group, came up empty for the stretch run. LONG CROW remained back throughout in failing to threaten. THE SKIPPER TOO fell back
after the start and failed to menace in a dull effort.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE outrun in the early going, advanced four out to five wide exiting the turn, hooked up with the runner up with a furlong remaining, spirited duel to
the wire, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. DON'T FORGET in the second flight outside early, four wide through the turn, moved to challenge when
straightened for home, put a head in front past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire with the winner inside that one, missed. FLAT LUCKY fell back to trail
after the start, swung out to be four wide late in the turn, showed belated interest to be up for the show. TOWN CHAMP broke out and steadied to be last
away, lacked speed, swung five wide into the lane, also improved position with some late energy. ADMIRABLY brushed at the start, raced mid pack and
three wide into the lane, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. PRINCIPE GUILHERME in mid pack just off the inside, lacked a closing
response. STURGILL broke alertly, set the pace while racing in the two path, faltered when headed in mid stretch. DRENA'S STAR chased the leader for a
half along the inside and then gave way at the head of the lane. SEA TO SUCCESS forwardly placed for a half, stopped.

Footnotes
EASTSIDE COOL away well, set the pace just off the inside, rated in the two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, responded when challenged past
the furlong marker, turned back that rival with a sixteenth remaining, drove clear. CALIBRATE settled off the pace and the inside, unhurried into the far turn,
came three wide into the lane, shifted out for room, finished willingly late to be in time for the place. GO WEST orwardly placed early while three wide,
chased the winner while still in the three path through the final turn, lodged a bid outside that rival approaching midstretch, dueled, faltered final sixteenth,
caught late for the place. V. I. P. WHO in the second flight while three wide, between foes through the second turn, once again in the three path into the
stretch, chased the dueling leaders past the furlong marker and lacked the needed closing punch despite firm handling. FLATOUT WINNER off a step slow,
lagged back the middle half, came four wide out of the final turn, showed some belated interest while widest down the lane. ALLEGE lacked speed off the
inside, four wide through the second turn, went evenly to the wire. EGO off a step slow, four wide into the first turn, three wide through the second, failed to
rally. FIRST LINE off slow, remained back in failing to threaten. KURILOV (CHI) within striking distance for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. TIZ
MCNAMARA five wide through the first turn, vied up the backstretch while remaining very wide, continued five wide through the second turn, stopped.

Footnotes
LAST SAMURAI broke alertly, asked along to maintain inside and forward position past the rail the first time, clear early first turn, relinquished the
advantage onto the backstretch, remained in a forward position up the backstretch, crept back into the fray while saving ground out of the final turn, put a
head in front when straightened for home, drew strongly clear under a firm hand ride to the wire. FEARLESS broke well, raced forwardly and four wide into
the first turn, prompted the issue the middle half from the three path, between horses into the lane, appeared to stall a furlong out, came again late for the
place, no threat to the winner. PLAINSMAN bobbled slightly at the start, followed the winner into the first turn, took control onto the backstretch, set a soft
pace while remaining just off the inside, between foes into the lane, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, weakened a bit late to be caught
for the place. SUPER STOCK in the second flight outside, loomed a threat four wide turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the run to the wire.
BEAU LUMINARIE tracked the pace along the inside, bit closer along the inside midway on the final turn, behind traffic while in the two path into the lane,
came up empty in the run to the wire. IDOL settled in the second flight while racing in the two path, fell back after a half, had little for the drive. RATED R
SUPERSTAR last away, trailed most of the way, five out to six wide exiting the final turn, got out a bit more upper stretch, lacked a closing kick.

Footnotes
YOU VEE CEE with the pace while four wide, continued to vie on the outside in the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, remained clear until late, held the
runner up safe in the waning strides under pressure. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN off a step slow, four wide into the turn, five wide exiting when beginning to
rally, finished well to be getting to the winner late. LOCHMOOR off slowly, raced towards the rear, in traffic midway in the turn, dropped inside for the drive,
finished up willingly to be in time for the show. DATA STORM pressed the issue early, moved forward to join the fray three wide and between horses
through the turn, inside the winner entering the stretch, remained closest to that one a furlong out, gradually weakened to lose a couple of positions late.
IMA BLING CAT in the second flight while three wide through the turn, weakened the final furlong to also lose position late. BLAME J D in mid pack up the
backstretch off the rail, three to four wide late in the turn, lacked closing response. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE in the second group while five wide into and
through the turn, failed to muster a response when called on with a quarter mile remaining. MACHO ROCCO set or forced the pace for a half along the
inside and faltered. RACY JAYCEE broke back and failed to menace. HERITAGE PARK broke through the gate prior to the start, away on top, flashed brief
speed in the two path then gave way in the turn. WHENTHEDOVESCRY made little impact while racing three wide. MAHOMEY reared at the start, became
cast in the gate unseating rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
