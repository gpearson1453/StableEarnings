GALLANT STAR never far back, closed willingly three wide through the final furlong and got up in the final strides. BORN TO BE KING pressed the pace
two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace and just missed hanging on. HALO'S DANCE unhurried early,
closed fast in the four path through the stretch, altered course to the eight path late and was steadily gaining ground. FLAMING HOT bobbled at the start,
sprinted to the lead, set a pressured pace along the inside for nearly a half then was outfinished. STRETCH RUNNER stalked the pace three wide into the
turn, drifted out and lost ground. KENTUCKY COOL was no factor. COTTON JIM had brief speed.

second. PAT DADDY had speed from the start, offered a mild bid along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. KHALFANI failed to menace.

Footnotes
SPECTACULAR ROAD broke in front, set all the pace, widened into the stretch and won under strong handling. LOCK ON stalked the pace from the inside
for a half, shifted out to the four path and finished clear for second. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR passed tiring rivals inside. ROBERTOS TICKET chased the
winner two wide for a half, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and faded late. YO BERBS failed to menace. BARITONE was void of early speed and
trailed.

Footnotes
NORTHERN JOURNEY chased the pace into the stretch, responded with a late burst under right handed urging to make the lead in deep stretch and drew
clear. CONGRATS JENSEN away alertly, set the pace with a clear lead until deep stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. STATUS
SYMBOL hopped at the start, rushed up to a stalking position then finished with good courage three wide. CHECK OUT LINE saved ground and went
evenly. NATURAL BLING was no factor. SWEET CHELSEA trailed.
