Footnotes
BETTER BELIEVE stalked from outside, bid three wide turning for home, moved clear past the furlong marker under urging, was geared down late once
safely in front. DIM THE LIGHTS tracked in behind the leaders two wide, tapped on the brakes just slightly early on the turn, moved out leaving that bend to
be four wide in upper stretch, kept on to secure the place. SWAYEM broke a half-step slowly, advanced up the backstretch and outside rivals three then five
wide on the turn, was gaining too late. TATAS JOE MARK settled into stride, advanced inside a rival turning for home, was gaining too late.
NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN set the pace racing off the rail, faltered and faded in late stretch. CONCAN steadied slightly after the break, fanned six wide
leaving the turn and gained mildly. BYE BYE HEATH raced outside a rival mid-pack three to four wide through the turn, was taken hold of steadying slightly
at the three-sixteenths, failed to rally. REMEMBER SIXTYTWO was fractious behind the gate, raced mid-pack inside a rival but off the fence, came up
empty. SHAME ON SAM was never a threat.

Footnotes
DOM PROUD settled into stride off the pace, went two wide into the turn, swung eight wide out of that bend, took aim and struck the lead at the sixteenth
pole from outside then drove clear. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL settled off the leaders, went three wide on the turn, was carried out in upper stretch but
kept on to get up from between rivals for the place. CHARITY WATER broke a bit awkwardly, advanced four wide on the turn, was carried out a bit in upper
stretch, evened out late but got show honors. LA DIAMANT chased from inside a rival, went five then four wide on the turn taking the lead at the top of the
stretch, drifted out several paths in upper stretch and weakened. NO REGRETS N LOVE chased from outside six then five wide on the turn, weakened in
the stretch. SHEZACONSTANTSONG shifted in early, saved ground on the turn, came out in the stretch but was never near enough to threaten. WHY
BABY WHY was rushed to a clear lead racing well off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn, came up empty. ROX FROM NAVARONE
tracked the leaders, was encouraged along two to three wide on the turn, was in just a hair tight in upper stretch, faded thereafter.

Footnotes
AUTUMN TOUCH set the early tempo from inside, ceded the lead heading up the backstretch, came again along the inside to retake command just past the
furlong marker, was challenged by others at that point but dug in to prevail. DIXIE JEN broke a step slowly, settled while shifting in heading to the first turn,
came out up the backstretch and advanced four to five wide on the far turn, kept on gamely to get the place. STORM N GOLD stalked four wide, was
outfinished for place. PARADISE N REACH caught four wide on the first turn, raced last but one early, advanced some three wide on the far turn, came out
in the stretch and continued to gain mildly. MS HIGHSPEED settled at the rear three wide early, swung seven wide turning for home and was never near
enough to threaten. GRACEANNE was caught five wide on the first turn moving forward outside rivals to gain position, took the lead at the five-eighths,
continued to lead while two wide on the far turn, faltered and faded and stretch. ATTACKING GIRL pursued the leader briefly inside on or just off the rail
early, retreated.

Footnotes
BEAR CLAW exchanged a hard bump at the start then moved forward to take command, shifted in once clear to set the pace near the inside through the
turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held sway. DISCOVERY N SIGHT switched outside the leader into the turn, went two to three wide on that bend
making a mild bid but offered no extra thereafter while clearly second best. WHO'S ON THE RUN stalked from outside going four wide on the turn, was best
of the rest. PUNCTUATE THIS veered in and steadied sharply at the start, recovered to move up near the inside, moved out from two to four wide on the
turn swinging eight deep into upper stretch, ran on evenly to improve position. JUVAL was reluctant to load, bumped lightly into another rival at the start,
shifted in to go three wide on the turn before coming out for the drive, improved. GRIFTER exchanged a hard bump at the start then lightly bumped another
rival, advanced three wide on the turn but could not rally in the lane. GEEBEESBIGBOY chased inside, dropped back and faded. B R KIDD ROCK got away
alertly, showed brief speed, continued to chase three wide into the turn, faltered and faded. SHAME ON ROOSTER was lightly bumped at the start, trailed
racing well off the inside five to six wide on the turn, was never a threat.

break, recovered to stalk in behind the leaders mid-pack three wide, found room inside rivals in upper stretch, took a narrow lead in mid- to late-stretch,
dueled but could not hold off the winner. HALEY WHO forced the pace three to four wide, weakened. ILOVEHER moved in from three to two wide on the
turn, had room along the inside in the stretch but offered no late kick. MORATTA was brushed at the break, trailed early, angled out from four to six wide on
the turn, ran on evenly to improve position. DANIEL'S GIRL came out at the break, pressed the pace from inside racing well removed from the rail in the two
to three path, came up empty. BACKTOFLASH failed to rally after going five wide and outside on the turn. GEE ETTA tracked the leaders inside, faded.
SHAKE RAG brushed a rival at the start, chased mid-pack four wide, faded.

Footnotes
SHERIFF BROWN exchanged a bump at the start, settled in unhurriedly at the rear racing off the fence, began to pick it up into the far turn, swung ten wide
turning for home and drove past late with a strong rally. ZESTFUL exchanged several bumps into the first turn dueling outside a rival while very wide going
roughly five to six deep on the first turn, continued the duel up the backstretch and far turn but nearer the rail to be about four wide on the far turn, was no
match for the winner. CONVENTION switched off the inside going three wide early, continued while wide on the far turn, took closer order in upper stretch,
drifted out and bumped a rival and lacked the needed late kick. MINE THAT STAR exchanged bumps heading to the far turn dueling inside a rival but far off
the inside in the five path, continued to duel up the backstretch and far turn but nearer the rail in the three to four path on that bend, weakened in the stretch.
MCENTIRE moved in from five to three wide on the first turn racing outside a foe and well back from the dueling leaders, moved closer in upper stretch after
going three to four wide on the second turn, was bumped in mid-stretch and had no late kick. LIMONITE exchanged a bump at the start, settled last but one
four wide early, shifted in once in upper stretch and failed to rally. MAGIC MOSCO raced mid-pack two to four wide early, moved out further leaving the first
turn, went four to five wide on the far turn, was within striking distance in upper stretch but turned up empty. SANTIAGO'S TOWER broke a bit awkwardly,
raced just off the inside, faded. SLY angled in early, chased inside, faded. OPENING QUARTER-MILE FRACTION CHANGED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
MCTHANKS pressed the pace two to three wide, took the lead just past the furlong marker then held a challenger at bay. STRYDER stalked three to four
wide, engaged the aforementioned in mid-stretch to duel but could not get past. HIT A NOTE reared at the start and was off slowly spotting the field about
five lengths, moved up outside the trailing group, went four to six wide throughout and gained late. MCCLASSIC saved ground on the turns and ran evenly.
DECK HUMOR stalked from outside four to five wide, lacked the needed late kick. JEDI WARRIOR shifted in heading to the first turn, raced two to three
wide on the turns and failed to rally. ALMOST A STORM set the pace inside, faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
