Footnotes
OVERANDOVERAGAIN raced close up behind the early leaders, stayed inside with a rail bid turning into the stretch and drove clear through the final
furlong. HARD CHOICE set the pace near the inside, had the two-path into the stretch, could not hold off the winner but remained clear of the rest. WICCA
WISDOM broke slowly, raced three to four wide around the turn toward the back, and rallied mildly to prove best of the remainder. VICTOREM broke a step
slow, saved ground in the second flight early, moved out for the drive and posed no threat. PRETTYASPINK faded after a half-mile three wide. CAPRIDREY
trailed to the stretch, and made no late progress. ANGELIC STORM pursued the pacesetter from outside for a half-mile, could not keep up under a drive
after that, and dropped back. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
OCOTZINGO pressed TWO COLOR MAP from outside, poked a head in front coming to the eighth-pole and edged clear staying on his left lead. UPTOWN
LIGHTS stayed in range early inside, moved out for the drive and rallied to get up for second near the wire. TWO COLOR MAP set a pressured pace inside,
yielded to the winner leaving the furlong grounds and lost the place late. CODYS EXPRESS was a step slow at the break, saved ground throughout and did
not seriously menace. STRAIGHT TIME brushed with SUPER QUALITY after the start, fanned five wide under a drive approaching the stretch, and made
no impact. SUPER QUALITY was brushed between horses just after the break, raced two to three wide and lacked a rally. SUCH IS LIFE came in initiating
some contact with SUPER QUALITY after the start, chased three to four wide, and tired after a half-mile.

Footnotes
DILIGENT was content to stalk the leading duo to the far turn, ranged up three wide to take over approaching the stretch, kicked clear roused mildly through
the furlong grounds, and was in hand the last sixteenth of a mile. COLONIST raced in the second flight three wide to the stretch, and rallied mildly outside to
go clear late for second. POCO CHARLIE saved ground in midpack on the turns, and was just up outside FARLEY to get the show. FARLEY pressed
BENEFACTOR from outside, poked a head in front after six furlongs between horses, was no match for DILIGENT into the lane and weakened on the rail.
UHTRED raced three to four wide, and tired after six furlongs. AMBASSADOR JIM was outrun inside. BENEFACTOR set the pace inside under constant
pressure, and gave way approaching the stretch.

Footnotes
UNSOCIABLE was bumped between foes at the start, stalked the pace two and three wide, closed steadily and was up in deep stretch. FAITHFUL RULER
pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and angled into the two path, drew clear in upper stretch and led
until the final strides. LUCAGO lacked early speed, raced five wide around the turn and rallied for the show. STARTING UP went evenly while racing four
wide. UNIFIED CONQUEST was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. PURE SPEIGHT raced off the pace two wide between foes
and lacked a rally while drifting out under left-handed urging. I'LL FINISH was outrun inside. CALCULATED BREEZE broke inwardly and bumped
UNSOCIABLE into UNIFIED CONQUEST, sped to the front, was collared near the five-sixteenths marker and retreated through the lane. THIS RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
AWKWARD PAUSE settled in the second flight toward the inside early, moved out three wide leaving the turn, rallied through between horses a furlong out
and kicked clear late. HUNTER broke slowest and trailed for three furlongs, began rolling on the far outside through the furlong grounds and finished
strongly. CIANGO was never far back, lodged a bid two wide coming off the turn, and was outkicked through the late stages. CAJUN BAYOU was
outsprinted early inside, swung four wide off the turn and offered a mild response. ROYAL MAHOGANY set a pressured pace inside rivals to the stretch,
and gave way leaving the eighth-pole. HEY HOMBRE pressed the pace outside, drifted five wide coming off the turn and faded. THE BEAST cut the corner
in range turning for home, but came up empty. KING D was never prominent while racing wide. ROCK SOLID WORDS argued the pace between horses for
three furlongs, and gave way.
