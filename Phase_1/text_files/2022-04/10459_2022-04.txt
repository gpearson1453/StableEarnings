KEARNEY stalked the pace, angled out on the turn, bid seven wide and wore down his rivals to get up late. HANNIGAN was hustled along to set a
pressured pace to deep stretch and was outclosed to finish second best. PHANTOM MAC angled in for the drive, closed inside and got up for show. EZ
GUESS bumped at the start, vied to mid stretch and was unable to sustain his bid. ATTORNEY LOUIS angled out on the turn to bid six wide and failed to
rally. TANGLED THOUGHTS broke out and bumped at the start, trailed the field, went widest in the drive and lacked a bid.

DOUBLE DARE YOU sprinted clear to set the pace and extended the lead while ridden out. THUNDER WOMAN stalked the pace, angled out on the turn,
bid ten wide and got up for place while no threat to the winner. MAYBEE A DIVA was slow early, closed inside, hung late and settled for show. CAMEO
SHORES failed to menace in an even effort. MY FUNNY GAL chased the pace, swung wide leaving the turn and gave way. MY EXPRESSION had brief
speed only. TWIRLY GIRL trailed the field and showed little.

TRUTH TO POWER pressed the pace while racing four wide, swung wide leaving the turn, assumed command with a short lead and drew off near the
sixteenth pole under steady urging. BUHM'S CANDY BOY set the pace to the second turn, was headed, continued willingly and yielded near the sixteenth
pole to finish second best. SHARP'S FLASH raced close to the pace, saved ground, went around a tiring rival on the turn, closed inside, lacked the needed
rally and earned show. LUCKY CHAMP stalked the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn and was not urged through the stretch. DEPUTY
KNIGHT trailed the field. DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION, BUHM'S CANDY BOY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND UNPLACED.

dueled to the upper stretch, inched clear, led to deep stretch and was outfinished. FANCY GI GI raced in the back, bid off the rail, closed steadily and
gained late. AQUINAS had the rider lose the whip leaving the turn, went eight wide and closed well. WISHFUL WON lagged early, went eight wide at the top
of the stretch and finished well. TRIPDOWNMEMORYLANE stalked the pace to the turn, fell back and leveled off. PERFECT EDITION stalked the pace

LARRY'S LEGEND assumed command on the turn, drew clear and extended the lead under urging. AMERICAN BUDDHA bumped at the start, raced in the
back, angled out for the drive, bid nine wide and got up for place. MISAWA raced close to the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, was carried out, angled
back in, bid and came up empty late. BUDDY NINER bumped at the start, went ten wide at the top of the stretch and closed well. GOLDEN STAR ROCK
trailed the field, offered a mild bid and improved position. CREATIVE ONE stalked inside to the turn, dropped back and gave way. YEROSILVERBIZ
pressed the pace to the turn, was steadied and stopped. CURLING SECRET set a pressured pace to the turn, tired and stopped.
