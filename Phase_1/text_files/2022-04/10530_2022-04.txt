HOT STOVE LEAGUE went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won handily. WE NEED A FIVE raced within contention, moved up and followed
the winner to the wire, proving no match, but was best of others. MISTA VALENTINE raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, proved no match for
the top two, but got up for show. THISGUYCANFLY raced near the back in the beginning, moved up, within contention, had an outside trip and hung late. F
J'S GEM void of early speed and passed tired ones. MAJESTIC SOCIETY lacked early speed and was never a threat. HOPE FOR CHANGE pressed the
pace, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back. FAR OUT TIME raced within striking distance and made a steady retreat.

SPANKHURST unhurried in the early going, moved up between rivals around the turn, angled out entering the stretch, made an outside rally and finished
strong. SILVER RATIO sprinted to the front, drove clear, but couldn't hold off the winner for the win. CORN POP vied for the early advantage, forwardly
placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. INTIMIDATION lacked early speed, came around the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, racing
wide, but was no factor. RUNANDHIDE WIND void of early speed and passed tired ones. SUN STRIKER raced within contention and faded. CARIBE
NIGHTS always raced near the back and showed little. MAJESTIC MANDATE flashed early speed and dropped back.

Footnotes
JAX MAN unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the turn, split rivals down the stretch and was going away at the end. VENN pressed
the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. FATHER GOOSE vied for the early lead, raced close
throughout, but proved no match for the top two. WISE VERDICT lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. MAGAWILDTIME raced in the
middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside and lacked a late kick. HAIL STATE raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort.
DUSTY BOY void of early speed, finished wide and was never a threat. BINDING AGREEMENT pressed the early pace, raced four wide around the turn
and faded. BUNKIE'S SONG flashed early speed and dropped back.
