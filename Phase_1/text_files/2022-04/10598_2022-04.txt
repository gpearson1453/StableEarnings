LEAKY CAULDRON was well rated early, made a three wide move on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew clear by the furlong marker and then
remained clear to prove best. KAREN'S WAY set the pace while racing off the rail, was trying to get out on the turn and fighting the rider, then was sent
down at the furlong marker and finished willingly to gain the place award. QUEEN ROSEMARY was allowed to settle, advanced four wide on the turn and
angled out leaving the three sixteenths and was along for the show award. MINER'S GEM stalked the early paced and made a four wide bid on the turn but
flattened out the final furlong. KIRBY chased the early pace and was on the inside on the turn and weakened.

GOLDEN CANDY was well placed on the inside, slipped thru leaving the turn and hit the front nearing the furlong marker, then kicked clear to prove best
under mild crop urging. DON'T LOSEMYMONEY dueled for the early lead on the inside, then made a bid to gain a short advantage by the quarter pole,
came off the inside leaving the turn and could not go with the winner late while holding on to the place award. NEWSTOME was rated early, made a four
wide move on the turn and loomed boldly by the furlong marker but hung late. MEMORY BOUQUET pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on
the turn but flattened out. COLONEL MOORHEAD lacked a rally. MEET ME AT MUNDIS had no rally. GRAB THE GOLD dueled for the early lead two wide,
then was between rivals and weakened by the quarter pole.

Footnotes
TAKE IT TO SCALE was rated along four wide early, made a three wide move on the turn and drew clear leaving the turn and then was kept to a mild drive
to prove best. MEROCKETMAN chased the early pace on the inside, steadied nearing the five sixteenths, then shifted off the inside and advanced two
wide, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and finished willingly to be clearly second best. CUMBERLAND GAP tracked the early pace and was between
rivals by the five sixteenths, then was three wide by the quarter pole and came up empty in the drive, bested rest. TOP HAT TREASON was off a step slow,
then was outrun early, advanced two wide on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. CAMGO was settled early, was three wide on the turn and came four
wide into the drive and had no rally. SPIKES SHIRL failed to menace. ROCKIN COWBOY dueled for the lead three wide and made a two wide bid on the
turn and faltered in the drive. JERSEY JOE B dueled for the lead on the inside and stopped.
