Footnotes
BEEF WINSLOW sped to the front and took the rail, set all the pace to the stretch, put to mild urging in the lane and drew off. FLINTMORE raced along the
inside then moved out on the backstretch, navigated the far turn four wide, could not make any headway on the winner in the final furlong but outkicked the
inside trio of rivals for the place honors. TUSKEGEE CAT was closet in pursuit in the two path through the early going, ridden two wide on the far turn, was
no match for the winner in the lane and got edged for second. LIL BRO COOP stalked the pacesetter along the rail, came under coaxing on the far turn but
could not produce a bid while getting outkicked for the place and show. NINEELEVENTURBO settled outside a rival, exited the far turn four wide and could
not summon the needed response. MIGRATION got put in tight and checked early, became rank and checked hard on the first turn, settled along the inside
in the middle stages, angled out and came four wide into the lane but lacked a serious rally. BIRTH OF COOL settled off the pace early on, saved ground on
the far turn then raced a bit off the rail into the lane, tipped out in upper stretch, lacked room behind a wall of rivals and altered out with a sixteenth
remaining but could not regain momentum. TORAJIRO got a bit crowded at the start then was forced to check soon after, moved to the inside for the first
turn, checked off heels again around the bend, saved ground into the lane and failed to menace. OVERRULE broke a step slow, went three wide around the
first turn outside a rival, moved to the two path for the second turn, raced off the rail into drive and failed to respond. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT broke slow from
outside, rounded the first turn three wide, stayed off the rail then angled out on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and never got involved.
LAFORGIA raised off the ground slightly and came away a bit slow then got shuffled back soon after, trailed around the first turn, came three wide into the
lane and was not a factor.

UNBROKEN STAR hustled from the gate, rated outside the leader early then moved up to apply pressure, challenged with four furlong remaining, held a
narrow advantage while dueling around the far turn, drifted in and bumped LOOKIN FOR REVENGE in upper stretch, put away that rival at the eighth pole,
met the challenge from MONGOLIAN LEGEN with a sixteenth left to run and disposed of that challenger to hold gamely. MONGOLIAN LEGEND rounded

bit off the rail then two wide on the first turn, entered the far turn inside a pair of rivals, tipped out to the two path around the bend, moved out in the lane and
never responded to urging. CLAIM OF PASSION coaxed from the gate and was forwardly placed three wide on the first turn, chased off the rail in the

Footnotes
SUMTER dueled outside a rival into the first turn then cleared and angled to the rail around the bend, met the challenge from DURANTE with three-eighths
remaining, disposed of that rival approaching the quarter pole, led into deep stretch, challenged by a pair of rivals late and was able to hold on. BALNIKHOV
(IRE) was off slow to begin, moved to the inside to stalk the pace, saved ground to the stretch, tipped two wide in the lane, put in a late bid and just missed
from between runners. HANDY DANDY broke alertly then dropped back off the pace, traveled in the two path then got floated out a bit when bothered by
ALMANERA (IRE) briefly on the first turn, went between rivals while moving closer up the backstretch, asked two wide on the far turn, tipped four wide in
upper stretch, rallied three deep in the final sixteenth but was too late. DURANTE showed early speed and dueled into the first turn from inside, ceded
command around the bend and angled off the rail, took closer leaving the backstretch and bid outside at the three-eighths pole, lost touch with the winner
approaching the quarter pole, gave chase three wide in the lane and flattened in the final furlong. ALMANERA (IRE) pulled along the inside then steadied off
heels on the first turn and moved out a bit, stalked three wide in the middle stages, continued in the three path around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
BELLA RENELLA chased between foes, got bumped and put in tight early, followed the top pair two then three wide on the turn, angled in at the top of the
stretch and bid inside the leader, battled in the furlong grounds and got up. DISCERNMENT pressed three deep then dueled from outside, took over at the
three-eighths pole, inched ahead midway around the turn, cleared into the stretch and moved out at the top of the lane, met the challenge from the winner in
midstretch and yielded grudgingly. CIRCULODEGANADORAS got bumped from inside leaving the gate, sped to the front and led with rivals on both sides,
dueled with DISCERNMENT leaving the backstretch, lost command at the three-eighths pole, fought back from inside then lost touch with that rival into the
stretch and flattened to third. JAMMINJL coaxed from the gate, chased between and got put in tight early, moved to the inside for the turn, saved ground to
the stretch and could not rally. TIME FOR EBBY tracked outside rivals and got bumped early, went two to three wide around the bend and never responded
to urging. HOT ON THE TRAIL pressed from inside the top pair early, could not keep up leaving the backstretch, angled out around the turn and came four
wide into the lane and weakened. TRULY FABULOUS broke out and bumped rival, was a bit rank trailing the field early, went three then four wide around
the turn and made no impact.

Footnotes
GOLD PHOENIX (IRE) stalked in the two path then outside a rival, took aim three wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader with a furlong to go,
cleared at the sixteenth pole, then was challenged by RIO OCHO (IRE) late and gamely prevailed. RIO OCHO (IRE) tracked two wide out of range, went
two to three wide into the drive, angled out and put in a late rally but could not get by. CARMELITA'S MAN pulled early along the inside, moved to the two
path for the far turn, chased between foes in the stretch, summoned a mild rally and gained the show. WILDER THAN MOST was closet in pursuit in the two
path, bid outside the leader past the three-eighths pole, lost touch at the top of the stretch, kept on through the final furlong and got edged for the show.
CANE CREEK ROAD set the pace on the inside, met the challenge from WILDER THAN MOST past the three-eighths pole, maintained a short lead around
the far turn, put away that rival at the top of the stretch, lost command approaching the sixteenth pole and flattened inside. SPIRIT MAKER broke a step
slow, traveled between early then moved inside on the first turn, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, remained inside to the stretch, then moved out and
needed to find more in the furlong grounds. ONE FAST BRO was three deep early then moved into the two path, came four wide into the stretch and failed
to rally. AIR FORCE RED forwardly placed early and started to pull along the fence, settled on the backstretch, saved ground into the lane, then tipped off
the rail, lacked room with a sixteenth to go and could not regain momentum after steering to a clear path. LUVLUV broke a step slow, ran up on heels,
bobbled and checked entering the first turn, had to steady again around the first turn, pulled again and checked past the nine-sixteenths pole, saved ground
around the far turn and was not persevered with in the lane. NERVES OF STEEL pulled into the first turn and shifted out from behind rival, traveled off the
rail near the back, exited the far turn four wide and was not a factor. RIVER TIBER came away a bit slow, pulled at the back and steadied off heels into the
first turn, trailed two wide into the lane and made no impact. ONCOMING raced off the rail near the back, went three to four wide on the second turn and
was outrun.

Footnotes
SHAAZ sped to the front, drifted out a bit on the first turn then angled down to the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged by VITTORIO leaving
the backstretch, put away that rival past the five-sixteenths pole, then drew away under hand urging. VITTORIO got floated out a bit early on the first turn
then steered to the two path, was closest in pursuit from outside up the backstretch, launched a bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with
the winner past the five-sixteenths marker, chased two wide into the lane and bested the rest. SOY TAPATIO trailed four then three wide on the first turn,
moved closer up the backstretch from outside, navigated the second turn four wide, could not make any headway on the winner but gained the show.
CHARLITO chased four wide into the first turn then angled down to the two path, went three wide around the second bend and flattened in the late stages.
DARK VADER got shuffled between rivals prior to the first turn, steadied behind the leader around the bend, stalked from inside up the backstretch, roused
around the far turn and could not rally.

Footnotes
HAIL FREEDOM dueled from outside early then cleared angled to the rail, challenged from late on the turn, came three wide into the lane, shook free from
CAERULEAN and held well through the final furlong. CAERULEAN was forwardly placed in the two path early on, bid from outside approaching the dirt, lost
touch with the winner but continued to give chase through the lane and settled for second best. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK broke out and bumped rival,
chased in the two path then came out across the dirt, put in a mild late bid and gained the show. ROCKY GIBRALTAR came away slow to begin, angled
down to the inside, racing near the back, entered the stretch two wide and showed a mild response to earn a minor award. FRANKLIN ONE STAR broke a
bit slow and got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, traveled in the two path then entered the lane four to five and flattened out. SHORTMAN dropped
back between rivals early, raced three wide into the lane and improved position. REALLY BIG NEWS stumbled and bumped inside rival at the start, settled
off the pace, moved to the two path on the turn, came four wide into the drive and could not rally. BIG FLAME sat off the pace, went four wide into the turn,
angled to the three path then came five wide into the stretch and lacked further response. DIVINE RASCAL dueled for command early then chased the
leader three wide into the turn, bolted crossing the dirt, eased in the lane and coasted across the wire, then walked off following the race.

Footnotes
MY KENTUCKY GIRL broke out a bit to begin, sat off the pace early on, traveled six wide up the backstretch, went five then four wide around the turn,
rallied steadily in the lane and got up in the final strides. LADY T brushed outside rival at the start, raced in range outside rivals, went four into the turn, took
aim at the top pair three wide exiting the bend, gained command in upper stretch and moved clear, led into the final sixteenth and got run down in the
closing moments. FAMILY AFFAIR tossed her head slightly and broke slow, moved into range up the backstretch, bid outside the leader at the
seven-sixteenths pole, dueled on the turn and assumed command, carried a short lead into the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch and faltered in the final
furlong. M IS FOR MAGIC chased along the inside then tipped two wide on the turn and flattened in the stretch. AMERICAN HEIGHTS broke well then
dropped back a bit to chase the leader, traveled between runners on the turn and got put in a bit tight at the quarter pole, exited the bend three wide and
weakened. SECRET FIX sent for the lead, gained command and moved inside, dueled around the turn and gave way in the stretch. KARIN WITH AN I
broke a bit slow on the inside, trailed early, traveled along the inside then moved off the rail and came three wide into the stretch, steered out further in the
drive but was never a factor. ONE SILK STOCKING brushed with rival at the start, chased well off the rail then took an awkward step at the
seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back and was eased on the turn and down the stretch and walked off.
