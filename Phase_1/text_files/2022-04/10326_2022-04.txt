TOMS MAXIMILLIAN showed the most early speed to make the running on a short lead then held safe in the lane under steady handling. UNTETHERED
SOUL was just off the leaders four wide and narrowly gained the place late as the field bunched. LUCKY EVERY DAY tracked the winner three wide and
lacked the needed late effort and lost the place late. CHAYIL was along the inside and was outfinished for position in the blanket finish behind the winner.
ARROWSPHERE was in reach three or four wide and lacked a final closing run. MILLI STARR came five wide into the lane and made a mild gain while
coming up short for the minor awards. JAMACIAN ME MONEY saved ground and failed to threaten. MACHOS VISION was always back then came five
wide into the lane.

inside through the first turn, moved up into the lane but could not threaten late. GOTTA LOVE IKE stalked the pace in good position four wide but lacked a
final closing bid. WRATH prompted the two and three wide to the far turn and weakened in the lane to lose position. GOLD NOTE moved up four wide while

Footnotes
BOURN made the pace on a short lead inside, was headed nearing the lane but dug in and rallied back to go clear again late. AMERICAN REALITY moved
up inside going to the far turn, angled outside the winner to bid and show in front turning for home then could not handle the winner late while clearly second
best. PROMPTLY DONE moved up four wide to challenge into the far turn but could not sustain the move nearing the lane while holding position.
TELLITTOTHEJUDGE followed the pace three wide, angled in to move up in the far turn but could not close the gap late. ROLLIN BLACKOUT saved
ground and moved up but could not threaten late. TAP THE HEART followed the pace three to four wide and weakened. HEAVENS PRINCESS was not a
threat. PRESLEY'S ARTWORK tracked the winner's pace from outside to the far turn and tired. AMERICAN SUE was forced out over heels as a rival got
out into the first turn and was always back. POW POW showed speed but got out going to the first turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
TRACK SMART was on the pace inside while pressed throughout and slowly edged away late. FRENCH ROSE forced the pace outside the winner then
could not go with that one in the lane. EMOLGA was along the inside to move up into the far turn, angled four wide into the lane but could not produce the
needed late run. QUEENS GIFT was five wide in the first turn, stalked the pace in reach four wide but lacked a rally. GOODNIGHTLOVING failed to mount a
bid three wide. REMARKABLE CHARM improved position four wide while not a threat. SWEET TATUM saved ground and failed to threaten. BREW CASA
followed the pace four wide and weakened. LONG MONDAY was always back.
