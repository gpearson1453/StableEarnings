Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE JAM saved ground, bid into the backstretch and improved steadily, rounded the far turn in the four path, drifted leaving the turn but dug in
under steady encouragement to get up the final yards. BLUE COLLAR BOY rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, dueled to a slim lead leaving the far turn, raced briefly clear mid-stretch but was caught late. SALTY J J settled toward the inside, dueled to the
lead at the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was caught a furlong away then relented the final sixteenth. MIKI gave up a
several length advantage when he dwelt in the gate, rounded the opening turn in the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole then flattened the final
furlong. WEAVE IT QUIXOTE raced with the pace two deep then took the lead nearing the nine sixteenths pole, was met toward the five sixteenths, gave
chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far turn. MINI BOLT was not a factor. CEDAR RUNS CASTLE raced with the early pace then gave chase
from the nine sixteenths pole and faded readily past the three eighths.

YOUTHINKTHATSFUNNY was shuffled back on the chute and settled well off the early pace, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, eased outward to
the six path on the turn and closed with a rush through the stretch to get up the final yards. CAIRO CALLING rated a slim early lead inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement but was caught in the final yards.
LOOKATLITTLEFERRIS chased outside, raced close in the three path of the turn and ran evenly through the lane. DAN THE MAN CAN chased, rounded
the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. MACY'S BOY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn mostly at the rail, angled to the five path
toward the head of the lane then flattened the final sixteenth. PETE THE BEAST chased, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. COWBOY AT

Footnotes
DECO STRONG stalked from the three path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in for the
nod just inside the sixteenth pole and was steadily encouraged to hold on well. COMPLETE SURPRISE rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, gave up the nod inside the sixteenth pole and just lasted for second.
TEQUILA FOG saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled out into the lane then
dueled through the final sixteenth for third. DARIA'S ANGEL settled off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of
the far turn then outfinished for third the final sixteenth. SHE'S DANCING rated close toward the inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail
on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was not a factor. TUNSTALL stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven
sixteenths pole and remained close through the backstretch, but faded at the rail on the far turn.

turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and finished well outside. CAROLINA BAMBINA stalked in the
three and four paths, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then weakened. UPSY DAISY DO saved early ground and showed little
response through the backstretch. TAKE ME HOME stalked off the rail the first turn, faded past the three eighths pole and rounded the turn about the five

ALPINE MOON was a bit sluggish getting into stride but picked up the chase from the half mile pole, rounded the turn off the rail, closed with a brisk rush to
get up the final yards and was drawing off toward the wire. GOOD KARMA rated a short lead inside, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole, held
the edge at the rail on the turn, drew clear into the lane but was caught in the final yards. COACH RUBE engaged in close chase through the backstretch,
factored two deep on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. COLLEGE KID chased, rounded the turn about the five path, left the turn outside and
finished evenly to pass rivals. SHERWOOD LADY gave chase, ran in the four path of the turn and showed little more. GOT YOUR NUMBER chased
through the backstretch, ran in the two and three paths of the turn then weakened. NELLYSFORD was not a factor.

Footnotes
THREE BOPS chased, rounded the turn off the rail, dug in for the lead mid-stretch, drew briefly clear, and held on. DEALER'S GIRL chased inside early,
angled to the eight path on the turn, closed steadily outside to take second the final yards and was gaining on the winner. ZIG chased outside, rounded the
turn about the five path and dug in to take third the final yards. BARBSGRAY LION set a pressured early pace inside, gave chase from the three eighths
pole, raced close at the rail on the turn then flattened stride later yards. BELLA GIANNA chased inside, ran at the rail on the turn and showed little in the
lane. ROCKIN ANNA ROLLIN pressured the early pace, gave chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the turn about the three path then flattened in the
lane. TRUE HEIRESS accelerated to the front at the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in through the upper
stretch, started to weaken and was taken in hand mid-stretch then fell past the wire, though, got up and walked off. PRINCESS KILLMAIN was shuffled back
on the chute and raced well back.
