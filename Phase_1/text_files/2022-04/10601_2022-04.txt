Footnotes
A WHOLE LOTTA HULA pressed Awesome lady down the backstretch, raced three deep and finished well to get up under strong encouragement.
AWESOME LADY showed good early speed from the inside, resisted inside the eighth pole but couldn't hold off the winner late to finish second best.
SANDRA C was forced to take up sharply at the break, raced towards the back early on, made a strong moved past the three eighth pole, was four deep
around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. TALKINGNONSTOP stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid.
TAHOE BLUE stalked the pace, raced three to four wide and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ALEMOON raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole
and had no response. VEGAS BEAUTY raced towards the inside and had no response. HEAVENS PENNY raced far back and never threatened.
