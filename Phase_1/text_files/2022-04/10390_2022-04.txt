GOGETMBUGS tracked the early leader along the inside to bid along the rail through the far turn and move clear nearing the lane then was kept to task to
widen. ZIBBY TOO leaned into the side of the gate and came away last, moved up three and four wide but could not get to the winner in the lane.
POSSIBLY IN LOVE made the pace racing out from the rail to late backstretch and weakened into the lane. JAMACIAN ME MONEY followed the early
leader three wide and weakened. Five furlong fraction not available.

Footnotes
CHAYIL showed the most early speed to open a clear lead then held safe late as HAPPY ISSUE closed nearing the wire. HAPPY ISSUE was along the
inside, angled out inside the sixteenth and closed but could not reach the winner. S C ANGEL bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the winner three wide
and lacked the needed late rally. OUR PETUNIA bumped with a rival at the start, was with the leaders then steadied from tight quarters about the quarter
mile marker and could not rally back. SASSY SETA was out from the rail and had no rally.

Footnotes
HANDY BOY made the pace on a short lead just off the inside, dug in through the lane as BLUEGRASS BREEZE challenged from the outside then leaned
on and exchanged brushes through the lane and held. BLUEGRASS BREEZE moved three wide to challenge outside the winner into the far turn, continued
with that one to lean and exchange brushed through deep stretch then could not get by. The rider of BLUEGRASS BREEZE lodged a claim of foul against
the winner alleging interference through the lane which was not allowed. ORDER OF THE DAY tracked the pace three and four wide in close order but
lacked a final closing run. LEFT BEHIND was along the inside in good position behind the leaders, lugged in and nearly hit the rail in upper stretch then
could not produce the needed late run. THE BONDSMAN was not a threat three wide. NABS was not a factor. DARK LEOPARD was always back. HALO'S
LADDIE was outrun.

LOTS OF GOLD showed the most early speed to gain clear and move inside HOT HABANERO then drew off and held the margin under a steady hand ride
in the lane. RABBIT TWENTY TWO chased the leaders, moved inside and gained clear for the place in the lane. HOT HABANERO chased the winner
racing out from the rail and had nothing left in the lane. INSPIRATUS was not a factor. RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE was always back. SEGOVIANA was
outrun.

Footnotes
LADDIE BOY saved ground in behind the early pace, reeled in the leader while angling out in the far turn to bid three wide and moved clear in the lane
under steady handling. GREY ROGUE moved to a clear lead early and made all the running about the two path then was worn down through the final turn
and held the place late. KNOWYOUROPTIONS stalked the pace three and four wide, made a mild rally in the lane and just missed the place.
CAESARTHERULER stalked the pace two wide and failed to mount a solid bid. SCOOTER'S BOY moved up three and four wide while not a threat late.
MAKABIM was not a factor. JAZZY JUSTIN saved ground and weakened. AMERICAN CAMP dwelt several jumps at the start and was always back.
SHADES OF VICTORY raced midpack while four wide and tired. Fractional times not available.
