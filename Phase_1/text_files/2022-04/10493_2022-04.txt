Footnotes
ARTISAN DANCER broke alertly and was sent in hand to the front, set a solid pace while on a clear lead, shied away from the crop a bit in the final stages
and switched to the left lead inside of the furlong marker but was clear in the end. CIRCLE OF ROYALTY stalked the pace two wide on the turn, was
outkicked by the winner in the drive but was an easy runner-up in the end. QUITCHERSNIVELIN lacked early speed, was two wide along the turn, was no
match for the top pair but passed a tiring rival for the show. FIRST TIME PLAYER chased the pace three wide on the turn and faded in the late stages.
ALY'S NATION broke in at the start and was away slowly, saved ground while trailing and was not a factor.

Footnotes
EVENEREVENWORSE stumbled a bit at the start, attended to the early pace to the turn, pressed the quick pace through the turn, took command into the
final furlong, felt mild late pressure from the runner-up in the final sixteenth but held that foe at bay to prevail. KNOCKOUT BERT saved ground while
stalking the quick early pace, was steered three wide for the stretch run, rallied well in the final stages, could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of
the rest. KODIACTION settled just off of the pace, mounted a four wide bid into the drive, was outfinished by the top pair but closed to secure third.
GOVERNOR ARTHUR lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not mount a late rally. EXCESSIVE CAT broke alertly and was sent in
hand to the front, showed good early speed while setting quick disputed fractions, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

GALAN GRAY was sent in hand leaving the break and took command of the pace into the turn, was pressed through the turn by OLYMPIC SILVER, shook
free of that foe in upper stretch, edged to a clear lead in the final furlong and won in a drive. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE hopped at the start and was off a step
slow, recovered to stalk the pace through the turn from a two wide path, encountered traffic and lacked room nearing the furlong marker, found a seam late
and closed well in the end to get the nod for second. GALOPIN GOURMET was forwardly placed while three wide, came within aim nearing the furlong
grounds and was outfinished late, just missing for second. OLYMPIC SILVER broke out and bothered MAYHEM AND CHAOS at the start, threw his head
while pressing the early pace to the turn, kept pressure on GALAN GRAY through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened late. MAYHEM AND
CHAOS was bothered at the start, chased the pace three deep on the turn and tired in the stretch run. SLIGHT APPROVAL chased the pace from a ground
saving path and was not a factor.

JAN JAN CAN settled just off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker, closed well in the final furlong and was up just in time
to nail CALIFORNIA COOL on the line for the win. CALIFORNIA COOL broke alertly and was sent in hand to set the early pace, felt pressure nearing the
quarter marker, kicked to a clear lead in upper stretch, was kept to task through the lane, felt late pressure from the winner and was nailed on the line for the
win, while besting the rest. SWANEE stumbled badly at the start and was off slowly, chased the pace from the back while widest of the field, was outkicked
in the drive but kept on to get the nod for third. SOMARA tracked the early pace, closed on CALIFORNIA COOL nearing the quarter marker, gave ground to
that foe in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final stages, just missing for the show. BIG CHICK stalked the pace four wide, lost ground nearing the
quarter marker and lacked a late bid.

CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) was shuffled back a bit at the start, settled just off of the pace while three wide in the early stages, advanced through the
backstretch run, moved up to confront the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, took a narrow edge into the stretch run, was set down for the drive and
kicked clear in the end. FUNKY GREY was unhurried in the early stages while saving ground, advanced on the second turn, mounted a four wide rally into
the stretch run, was a bit green through the lane but kept on to secure second in the end. LAST STARFIGHTER broke alertly and was hustled to set the
pace into the first turn, set contested fractions into the second turn, was overtaken by the winner leaving the second turn and was outfinished in the end, just
being edged out for the place. ARISTEIA was difficult to place and rank on the first turn, settled along the backstretch run while just off of the pace, lost
ground on the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. LIL TINKER pressed the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost ground approaching
the second turn, swung five wide into the drive and tired in the late going. ROSES FOR MARILYN was forwardly placed early on while three deep,
advanced along the backstretch run, could not match strides on the second turn and gave way in the final stages. MISTICAL SURPRISE was fractious in
the gate, settled off of the early pace while four wide on the first turn, was steered two wide on the second turn and did not have a late response.

Footnotes
MEETMEATTHECLUB settled three wide just off of the early pace, advanced in upper stretch to confront the leading pair, took command into the final
furlong and drew clear in the end. HEAVEN SHINES was away well and took back to stalk the fast pace into the turn, overtook his stablemate in upper
stretch to take a narrow lead approaching the furlong marker, could not hold off the winner's bid leaving the furlong grounds and was outkicked late while
well clear of the rest for second. GALLANT OAK bobbled at the start and was hustled early on, showed good early speed while setting fast fractions through
the turn, was caught by HEAVEN SHINES leaving the turn and gave way in the late stages, while holding for the show. NORTH SEA was off a bit slowly
and lacked early speed, was three wide on the turn, lacked a late kick in the stretch run but passed tiring foes in the end to challenge for third. WALKING
BOSS was unhurried early on while two wide and lacked a late rally. MILEYS BLUECAT saved ground while chasing the fast pace and weakened in the
stretch run. ONE LAST THOUGHT chased the pace three deep on the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT was sent leaving the break and engaged with SUPER ANNIE to dispute the early pace, set quick fractions with that rival through
the quarter marker, shook clear in upper stretch and pulled away in the final sixteenth. BABTISTE LASALLE chased the early pace two wide, was between
foes on the turn, steadied in tight quarters midway through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but dug in in the final stages to get the nod for
second. TAM TRICKY was forwardly placed while three deep in the early going, gained ground on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but held for third
in the end while just missing for second. MIRACLE IN MOTION stalked the pace outside of rivals early on, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in
the late going, while just edged out for third. SUPER ANNIE broke alertly, was sent to duel for pace duties through the turn, helped to carve out fast fractions
to the quarter marker, gave way into the stretch and tired in the late stages. DARK INTENT was void of early speed and did not offer a late response.
HILLSDALE NATION was pinched at the start, lacked early speed, was steered four then five wide on the turn and was not a factor. KID DEELITES was
away a bit slowly, chased the quick fractions from the inside through the turn and tired in the drive.

TRUTH SEEKER was content to settle early on, was roused four wide leaving the quarter marker, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth and was up just in
time to get the nod for the win in a blanket finish. TORPEDO AWAY settled just off of the early quick pace, mounted a three wide bid into the lane, surged in
the final sixteenth and was nipped for the win while getting the nod for second. ISTANBUL was away well, showed good early speed, set fast contested
fractions through the turn, shook free in upper stretch to take a clear lead into the final furlong, was confronted in the final strides by the top two and was
tagged on the wire, edged for the win and place. R M C HOOK'EM had good early speed while contesting the early pace, lost position on the turn and
weakened in the late going. HANDR'SDREAM attended to the fast early pace, moved up to challenge the pacesetter approaching the quarter marker, was
turned away in that effort and faded in the stretch run. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT saved ground while chasing the fast pace through the turn, lost position in
upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
CAROLINA MIA broke sharply and showed good early speed while carving out fast fractions, disposed of her pressing rival leaving the turn, was kept to
task through the lane and ridden out in the end as much the best. CANAM GAL was pinched at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled off of the pace while
two wide, was no match for the winner in the stretch run but was clear for second in the end in a good effort. LA AGUILILLA chased the pace three wide
through the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but kept on to secure the show. QUEEN OF THE TRACK contested the fast pace through the turn, lost
ground in upper stretch, weakened in the drive and was just edged out for third. KITTY'S CANDY was away slowly and lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and made a mild late gain in the final sixteenth. BENGAL TIGER chased the early pace four deep, was floated
out a bit nearing the quarter marker, was still in contention nearing the furlong marker but faded in the late going. GRINNINGEARTOEAR chased the fast
fractions from the inside, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. ATLANTIC STRIKE was forwardly placed early on while chasing the pace,
lost position into the turn, took up nearing the three furlong marker, dropped back quickly on the turn and did not offer a late bid.
