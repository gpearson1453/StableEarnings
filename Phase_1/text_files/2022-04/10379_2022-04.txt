SHANGHAI WARRIOR had early speed inside, settled back and angled three wide entering the turn, stalked the duelers around the bend, took over leaving
the eighth pole, drew clear soon after, switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and widened while ridden out. MAJOR KING dueled two wide,
put away the pace rival in upper stretch, continued on the left lead through the lane, was collared leaving the eighth pole and stayed on to remain clear of
the rest. CHIQUITO BABY saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. PORK CHOP saved ground off the pace, angled
four wide in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. BLANK'S HAT TRICK dueled inside to upper stretch and faltered. MY FRIEND DUKE failed

Footnotes
LUNA WEST dashed clear after the start, showed the way a bit off the rail to the stretch, shortened stride late but had enough to hold on. CAJUN HOPE
chased outside LUNA WEST from the outset, and was inching closer at the finish while clearly second best. AWESOME FLAY was edgy in the gate, raced
three wide just inside KEANU. and edged the latter for third without threatening the top two. KEANU raced four wide on the turn, and was outfinished for the
show spot. BEAUTIFUL ASTRAY was ridden along through the turn, and lacked a closing response. ST. JOE JET broke slowly and was outrun on her left
lead. EXQUISITO COCO broke slowly and was outrun on his left lead.

SMART SPENDING broke in a tangle, saved ground off the pace, steadied near the three-eighths marker, edged closer at the rail around the far turn, tipped
three wide in upper stretch, quickly bid outside of foes, took over leaving the eighth pole and edged ahead of a stubborn foe in the final sixteenth. LADY JAE
pressed the pace two wide, took the lead turning for home, was collared by the winner leaving the eighth pole, fought on inside of that foe and gave way
grudgingly. ISADORABLE AIDA set the pace along the rail, was collared leaving the quarter pole, fought on inside of the top two to midstretch then
weakened. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN raced in range two wide, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole but could not sustain the move in the lane. SWEET
PEARL stalked the pace from the rail and lacked a closing bid. BIG BAD DIVA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. GREY CHARLOTTE
lunged at the start, chased the pace three and four wide and never threatened. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
TAPATERM broke outward and was unhurried early, advanced under a ride on the turn three then four wide, rallied steadily outside to take over past the
eighth-pole and drove clear. KHOPILOT bumped with ALFIE'S BOY at the start, saved ground outrun to the stretch, altered course to the outside entering
the final furlong and finished well to get up for second. GHOST FIGHTER vied inside early, had the rider drop the crop near the quarter-pole, and stayed on
with good courage to salvage a share. INNER WAVE argued the pace outside GHOST FIGHTER up the backstretch, could not hold position turning for
home, moved to the rail and ran on willingly. SANDY DUDE tracked outside the early leaders, bid three wide to reach a short lead after six furlongs, but
weakened in the last eighth of a mile. D BLACK MAMBA was no factor in the second flight throughout. I WAS BORN READY steadied off TAPATERM at the
break, trailed through the opening half-mile, put in a run four then five wide on the turn, but could not sustain the rally. I GEN stayed in range early outside,
and tired before reaching the stretch. ALFIE'S BOY bumped with KHOPILOT at the start, saved ground and tired after a half.

ALIZEE raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, kicked in and was up late. DRINKS ON ME stalked the pace two wide, split rivals
three wide near the eighth pole, led soon after, resisted inside the winner but could not stave off that foe in the late yards. VEIL tracked the pace three and
four wide and finished evenly to gain the show. MS BIG SPRING dueled along the rail to midstretch and weakened. I'M PRAYINGFORTHAT chased the
pace four wide and lacked a rally. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL dueled two wide to midstretch and tired. AFFICIONADO (FR) was outrun inside.

Footnotes
DISCREET TUNE bumped lightly with HIGH FRONT after the start, pursued PHASE OUT from outside early, bid between horses through the furlong
grounds and drove clear late. RUSE raced three wide around the turn, and was up outside HIGH FRONT at the wire for the runner-up spot. HIGH FRONT
was fractious unseating the rider in the gate prior to the start, backed out and reloaded, got put in tight between SPEARGUN and DISCREET TUNE and
was shuffled back to last after the break, advanced four then three wide on the turn, was outkicked by DISCREET TUNE in midstretch, moved into second
with 70 yards remaining but yielded that position in the closing yards. PHASE OUT sped clear early and moved inside, got collared past the eighth-pole and
gave way. ICE CHOCOLAT (BRZ) was no threat two to three wide. NICE ACE bumped with ZANNO early, and tired inside. ZANNO bumped with NICE
ACE early, steadied along the inside entering the turn, and remained well back. SPEARGUN broke out into HIGH FRONT, and was outrun. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
UNO TIGER settled in range inside, angled three wide to split rivals near the quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch and powered clear under a
drive. ASTROTURF settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied to gain the place late. EXCHANGE DAY disputed the
pace from the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and held well enough to preserve the show. BIG AND CLASSY dueled two wide to upper stretch
and weakened. MISTER LEONARDO slammed into the starting gate and nearly unseated the rider, raced well back inside early, advanced three and four
wide around the far turn but lacked a stretch bid. MARISA'S MISSION trailed inside, swung widest in upper stretch and lacked a rally. HOPE IN HIM stalked
the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
NO VALLA raced three wide, ranged up to poke a head in front outside rivals coming to the quarter-pole, outdueled RING RUN through midstretch and
edged clear under pressure. TIZ IMPRESSIVE was held up in traffic going to the first turn, went along near the back for six furlongs, fanned four wide
coming off the far turn, and rallied outside to get up for second. PRETTYKEEN saved ground to the far turn in the second flight, moved out three wide
approaching the stretch, and rallied mildly. RING RUN was up close early three wide, lodged a bid between horses on the far turn, got out-footed inside NO
VALLA through the furlong grounds and gave way. UNCAPTURED GRACE raced two to three wide, and lacked a solid response. WARWOMAN hesitated
at the break and lunged coming out two lengths slow, and never got close. HOTTER THAN JULY vied up front first time through the stretch, yielded to
SADE PURSE and lost position inside through the first turn, stayed close to the stretch and had nothing left. SADE PURSE set the pace for nearly six
furlongs, and folded once displaced for command nearing the stretch. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
