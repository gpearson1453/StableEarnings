Footnotes
WORLD GONE WILD was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside around the turn, responded well
when asked a bit off the rail into the stretch, led under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead when given a pop of a
right-handed crop at the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. MIDTOWN ROSE tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two to three
path through the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was outfinished while clearly second best. FIGHT ON LUCY broke out and was off
a step slow, was urged along at the rear, went three wide early on the turn then moved to five wide and lacked the needed response while up for the show.
MONSHUN showed speed inside the winner from the gate, was taken up briefly and dropped off the pace when beaten to the lead, was asked while inside
to the two path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. TIMED OUT broke a step slow then was hustled, was urged early then settled
near the back, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, was roused in the two path on the turn and failed to rally. AWILLAWAY broke a step slow,
settled on the outside, was asked in the three to four path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and capitulated.

responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, was given two pops of a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop into the final
furlong and proved best under strong urging. KUMAR was hustled from the start, showed speed on the inside of two foes, dropped just off the pace near the

Footnotes
CITY MAN rode the rail through the first turn before tracking from the two path down the backstretch in closest range of the top pair, tucked inside three
furlongs from home and was patiently handled in behind the leader, got given his cue angling two to three wide into upper stretch and burst on through into
daylight to take command with about three-sixteenths to go, edged clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. SANCTUARY
CITY settled just off the inside through the first turn at the tail of the field, raced three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path placed to
coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out to the three path near the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to willingly
chase the winner home clear for the place honors. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) hustled from the gate, dueled early on with RINALDI before establishing
sole command along the inside through the first turn, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside once more into
the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front with about three-sixteenths
to go and weakened in the late stages while safe for the show honors. THERAPIST settled just off the inside near the rear of the field through the opening
bend, then chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to
the finish. IT'S A GAMBLE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch,
tipped out to the two path in the final furlong and offered no response. PRICE TALK just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide down the
backstretch and through the far turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and weakened. RINALDI hustled from the start,
disputed the front early on with VALUE PROPOSITION before conceding the lead midway on the first turn, settled three then two wide in closest aim of that
rival, got placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, faded swinging three wide for home and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MO DONEGAL broke near the back while carried in a bit, settled while inside to the two path, was roused in the two path early on the far turn, gained while
cutting the corner into the stretch, moved out while rallying into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late and prevail. EARLY VOTING was a but
reluctant to load, came away in good order and went straight to the front, showed the way through solid fractions, was asked in the two path inside the
five-sixteenths, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place.
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, was ridden along while four wide on the far turn,
was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. A. P.'S SECRET was sent hard from the gate, prompted the
pace on the outside in the three path, was urged along on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired while just able to save the last spot in the
superfecta. BARESE broke near the back of the field, went four wide through the first turn, was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide around
the far turn, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. MORELLO hit the inside of the gate at the start and was off a couple lengths slow, went three
to four wide on the first turn, moved out around the three-quarter pole, was urged along in the four path around the far turn, dropped to the three path at the
quarter-pole and failed to respond. LONG TERM rounded the opening bend in the three path, settled off the pace, dropped back between foes in the three
path early on the far turn and faltered. GOLDEN CODE broke in then was hustled, was well placed while saving ground, came up empty along the rail on
the far turn and retreated.

SPEAKER'S CORNER four wide in aim of the front in the early stages, advanced to vie outside a trio five and a half furlongs from home briefly before taking
command near the half mile pole, tucked to the two path at that station forcing MIND CONTROL to be taken under a light checking hold, showed the way
through the turn patiently handled and slipping away, swung three wide into upper stretch under coaxing, drew clear under a drive to prevail.
REINVESTMENT RISK coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside in aim of the early duelers before advancing to vie inside a trio taking command near
the five furlong marker, showed the way briefly before being headed near the half mile pole, raced in closest aim along the rail through the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top rival while running on to secure the place honors
clear of the rest. MIND CONTROL dueled from the two path with BANK ON SHEA to his inside in the early stages, then vied between foes five and a half
furlongs out until forced to a light checking hold at the half mile pole as SPEAKER'S CORNER tucked to the two path in front, chased just off the inside
through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. GREEN LIGHT
GO broke out a step at the start bumping BANK ON SHEA, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper
stretch and weakened. DRAFTED four to five wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. BANK ON SHEA bumped at the start by GREEN LIGHT GO, dueled early on from the two
path with MIND CONTROL to his outside, before being joined by an additional pair with five and a half furlongs remaining, vied briefly with that trio before
being shaken off at the nine-sixteenths, tucked inside through the turn getting put to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, faded and took the inside route into

Footnotes
NOSTALGIC was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace, drafted inside on the far
turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into the stretch, rallied along the rail under a right-handed crop, closed well to get the lead just
inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. VENTI VALENTINE went to the front, was well rated while setting the pace in the two path,
responded well when asked at the five-sixteenths, came under the crop in upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while
clear for the place. SHOTGUN HOTTIE was taken under a strong hold early, navigated the first turn in the three path, was rated off the pace, continued
under some restraint in the three path early on the final turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while up for the show. CLASSY EDITION was taken under a very snug hold early, prompted the pace on the outside in the three path,
was asked on the far turn, chased the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. DIVINE HUNTRESS raced in the four path on the first
turn, tracked the pace under restraint, was given her cue in the four path on the far turn, gained some to make a brief bid in upper stretch, dropped back into
the final furlong and tired. MORNING MATCHA dropped back early, saved ground around the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along while inside on
the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path under the crop and failed to rally. CARAGATE was caught in the five path around the first turn then rated
on the outside, came under urging leaving the backstretch, went five wide on the far turn, floated six wide into the stretch and faltered then was eased but
walked off.

Footnotes
WIT four then five wide in pursuit, advanced outside a quartet with three furlongs to go, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and swung three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong, shied out slightly under a left handed crop and just got the bob on the
wire to score. HIGHLY RESPECTED coaxed from the gate, got bumped early on when OUTKISSED came inwards and in turn bumped DEAN'S LIST into
JUGGLER, settled three wide in aim of the front, tucked to the two path into the turn and was in behind a wall of rivals lacking optimal clearance between
foes until gaining daylight at the three-eighths marker, got roused and burst on through splitting foes inside that station to quickly take command at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole under a right handed crop, had that rider peek back
and switch his stick to his left hand when coming under growing threat to the outside, got directed out to look his main danger in the eye inside the final
sixteenth as that rival got on near even terms and was nailed on the final nod of the head at the finish. LIFE IS GREAT five wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors while never threatening the
top pair. DEAN'S LIST got bumped early on when in tight between foes due to pressure outside from OUTKISSED, chased two then three wide under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. SCARAMOUCHE coaxed from the gate, chased three
then four wide advancing into contention at the three-eighths marker, came under coaxing at that station, angled in to spin just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened in the final furlong. JUGGLER bumped early on by DEAN'S LIST when four rivals jostled for two lanes, chased along the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. FROMANOTHAMUTHA hustled from the gate, showed the way
coaxed along the inside under pressure from OUTKISSED to his outside, came under assault midway on the turn as a quartet stacked up to his outside,
yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded. OUTKISSED came in under coaxing just after the start
crowding a trio of rivals and bumping HIGHLY RESPECTED into DEAN'S LIST and in turn that rival into JUGGLER, pressed the pace of the aforementioned
foe from the two path coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and faltered in the drive.
