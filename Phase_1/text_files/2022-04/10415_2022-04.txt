Footnotes
EAGLE PASS hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced unhurried, began a three wide advance after five furlongs, lost some ground
to the leaders into the stretch, continued resolutely to grind out the win late. LEADER OF MEN within striking distance off the inside, advanced on the leader
from the outside late in the final turn, put a head in front late in that bend, dueled with that same rival upper stretch,continued to hold the advantage late,
caught in the final strides. GRAND DESIGN cleared in the run into the first turn, rated in showing the way up the backstretch, responded when headed by
the runner up, dueled with that rival past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. FUTILE off the pace and the inside, four wide second turn,
improved position down the middle part of the strip to be gaining for the show. BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER settled off the pace, went evenly in lacking a late
bid. CASHANOVA off a step slow, remained in lacking a really. ITS MY BAG BABY chased the leader for a half off the inside, gave way far turn.

Footnotes
AIN'T SHE A PISTOL in mid pack while racing off the inside up the backstretch, dropped to the inside when beginning to advance midway on the turn,
steered back out to be three wide when moving to challenge turning for home, took over, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. RIO LADY off
a step slow, asked along midway on the turn, swung out five wide when on the move into the lane, finished well down the middle of the strip while too late.
FIRST KITTEN forwardly placed while four wide up the backstretch, angled to be three then two wide turning for home, led between rivals into the lane,
weakened the final furlong, caught late for the place. AUTOSTRADA off a step slow, trailed early, four wide into the lane, improved position not a real threat.
MILANA pressed the issue early in the two path, floated out to be four wide turning for home, had little left for the stretch run well out in the strip.
PLANETARY broke back, failed to menace just off the inside. G MONEY LIV asked early up the inside to be briefly clear into the turn, showed the way
through most of the bend then gave way when headed by the top two entering the stretch. TROPINKA in the first flight up the backstretch while three wide
and between horses, in tight, steadied, fell back and failed to recover.

Footnotes
DEFENDER with the pace while three wide, shook clear of the other speed late in the turn, roused stretch, held the runner up at bay late under conintued
right handed encouragement. SHOTSKI in the second flight while outside, raced four wide through the turn, rallied well out in the strip to be getting to the
winner late. FLAT LUCKY back off the pace toward the inside early, steered out four wide late in the turn, staged a mild rally to finish best of the rest, not a
threat to the top two. HOT SHOT KID lacked early foot, raced three out to five wide through the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat.
NUCLEAR OPTION in the second group off the inside, angled in a bit to be two wide late in the bend, had little for the drive. JOE FRAZIER vied up front
between rivals for almost four furlongs and began to falter. SUBSTANTIAL broke in the air, remained always back. SILVER MOON ROAD narrowly set the
early pace along the inside, backed up.

Footnotes
MINICONJOU outrun in the early going off the inside, closer while four wide and between horses late in the turn, took over when straightened for home,
kicked clear under steady handling. PORTSMOUTH also back off the pace while outside the winner, four to five wide late in the turn continuing outside of
that rival, could not match strides through the lane, proved determined for the place. OILER broke back, void of speed toward the inside, steered out four
wide in some traffic late in the turn, improved with belated interest. COLD CITY behind the first flight toward the inside, one paced turn, in some traffic late in
the bend, continued evenly when clear for the drive, not enough for the show. AMITY ROAD narrowly showed the way up the backstretch in the two path
between horses, shook clear in the turn, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. SWEET ANALYZER off slowly, remained sluggish early to
race well back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. DEL MOON broke alertly, flashed some brief early speed and was finished before a
half. DRAG MALIBU vied up front in the three path, gave way quickly in the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
SKYSCANNER within striking distance up the backstretch off the inside, idled along in the three path for most of the turn, shifted out widest of the front
runners into the stretch, challenged a furlong out, drew strongly clear under pressure. BODE'S MAKER in mid pack early, raced five wide into the turn,
moved to challenged three wide late in the bend, led between calls in upper stretch, no match for the winner while lugging in just past the furlong marker,
saved the place. FIRERY TALE lacked speed toward the inside for a half, angled out four wide turning for home, turned in a late rally to gain the nod for the
show, gaining for second. SACRED OATH void of speed for four furlongs while saving ground through the turn, switched out with a furlong remaining,
improved position with some mild, late interest. LONELY PRIVATE away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, briefly raced on equal terms
with the runner up when that one challenged turning for home, faltered final furlong. BACHELOR PAD alternated up front while racing in the two path, was
beginning to tire when in tight upper stretch, continued to weaken in the run to the wire. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS broke back, void of speed, picked off some
tiring rivals without posing a serious threat. WAR DETONATOR in mid pack while racing in the two path, backed up in the drive. BIG FUDGE prompted the
dueling leaders up the backstretch off the inside, began a steady fade midway on the turn. KING OF THE COURT off a step slow, was always outrun while
racing four wide.

Footnotes
THUNDERHEART broke alertly, set the pace in the two path under light restraint, roused when straightened for home, edged away a bit with a furlong
remaining, held sway late under steady handling. INVARIABLY off a step slow, advanced into contention turn off the inside, traffic late in the bend, steered
toward the inside for room nearing midstretch, finished willingly to be getting to the winner inside that one in the late going. TENTH OF GOLD forwardly
placed early outside, lost some position while four wide through the turn, remained within striking distance past the furlong marker, lacked a closing punch.
STAINLESS STEEL away in good order, pressed the winner up the backstretch and into the turn three wide, came up empty when called on for the drive. K
C ROCKET in the second flight just off the inside, dropped to the inside while remaining behind the first flight turning for home, failed to muster a rally.
ARISTOCAT void of early foot, improved slightly in the two path without posing a serious threat. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO off a step slow, trailed for a half,
picked off a couple of faltering foes while also never dangerous. MESMERIZED in mid pack well wide, five path through the turn, tired. CLASSIC SHINE
behind the pace along the inside, steadied slightly to be shuffled back into the turn, trailed home.

Footnotes
PUNCHY GIRL broke back, outrun early well wide, five path into the turn, closer four wide late in the bend to lose some ground to the leader, collared that
one past the furlong marker, took command, just enough left late to withstand the winner. PATTERN BET broke back, was unhurried early inside, steered
out exiting the turn, shifted out a bit further for room midstretch, late surge to narrowly miss. DERBY DAY LASSIE broke sharp, quickly sprinted well clear,
continued to hold a daylight advantage through the turn, briefly responded when challenged by the winner a furlong out, caved late, saved the show. GOLD
STRATEGY in mid pack while well wide early, dropped inside late in the turn, went evenly through the lane. TRULY A ROCKET chased the leader for a half
and was finished by the head of the lane. ONE WAY OR ANOTHER in the second flight in hand and in the three path, had little for the run home. DANCIN N
THEPULPIT lacked speed, was finished early to never threaten. GRAMERCY PARK stumbled badly at the start, unseated rider, walked off.

Footnotes
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS broke back, leaned into the gap to began, remained back into the turn, swung out six wide when beginning to accelerate turning for
home, exploded with a burst of speed past the furlong marker, won going away. REED KAN broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, clear by early
in the turn, continued to hold a sizable advantage into and through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner, narrowly held the place. RIBBONS AND
MEDALS in mid pack early, advanced to race closest to the runner up by late in the turn, saw that progress stall through upper stretch, coming again for the
second position late. STORM ADVISORY last away void of early foot, angled out five wide and inside the winner turning into the stretch, could not come
close to matching that one, mild rally to improve position. ROLLING FORK in the second flight while racing outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a
closing response. LONG TERM THINKING lacked speed, moved closer when five wide midway on the turn, failed to sustain that advance through the lane.
TANGO CHARLIE chased the runner up early three wide and between foes, began to retreat before a half. MAJESTIC WEST in the second flight while off
the inside, also began to fade before four furlongs.

Footnotes
WHELEN SPRINGS off the early pace, moved inside and advanced into a striking position by midway on the turn, eased out and challenged between the
two early frontrunners late in the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, drifted in under a right handed crop then out under left handed pressure,
well clear. EV'S SHERMAN in the second flight off the inside in the three path into the turn, behind some traffic late in the turn, split foes late, no match
winner, determined for the place. BETTYS CASH broke well inside, set the pace, responded when confronted late in the turn, could not match the winner
late, gave ground grudgingly to the runner up. CITRUS BAY in the second flight outside the runner up, four wide turn, went evenly through the lane. PEACE
DOG pressured the leader while off the inside, inched closer to that one midway on the turn, floated out into the three path by the winner late in the turn,
stalled by midstretch and weakened. WHERE'S RANDY off a bit slow, raced back while saving ground, did not fire. KINFOLK back off the pace outside,
came five wide out of the turn, had little for the drive. ONE TEN STADIUM stumbled at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, raced back, three wide
through the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
MAHOMEY never far back on the outside, advanced and challenged four wide late in the turn while in hand, came five wide into the lane, kicked steadily
clear under a right handed crop. DOC IRWIN lacked speed, continued to lag three wide through most of the turn, rallied through traffic to be in time for the
place. MR. COUGAR broke back, raced three wide backstretch, fanned six wide into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip to finish up willingly.
BRASKA off a step, raced back three wide while continuing sell off the pace, remained three wide into the lane, shifted out widest past the furlong marker,
improved late with some late interest. ROLL DINERO ROLL in mid pack and outside for the run up the backstretch, four wide when beginning to move
closer late in the turn, closest to the winner a furlong out, flattened to lose several position to rallying rivals. PAPA STAR back off the pace, angled out five
wide and between rivals turning for home, went evenly through the lane. MAX BET never dangerous while just off the inside. ROCK CITY ROCKET in the
second flight along the inside, in traffic late in the turn and upper stretch, carefully ridden while continued to be surrounded past the furlong marker, finished
up evenly. LORD M broke alertly, vied three wide up the backstretch, held a narrow advantage midway on the turn, gave way when displayed into the lane.
DEPART off a step slow, remained always back to be outrun. FORSAKEN showed good speed along the inside, continued to vie into the lane, gave way in
the drive. MY LITTLE TIPSY vied up front while between rivals for a half, stopped.
