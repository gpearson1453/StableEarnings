RUNNING ON EMPTY saved ground while just off of the early pace, angled out leaving the bend, was put to steady urging through the lane and surged in
the final strides to prevail. FLOYD KNOWLES broke alertly and was sent to set the fractions, was pressed through the turn, was all out in the final stages
and was nailed on the wire for the win, while clear for second. SONORA SERMON pressed the pace two wide on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch
run, while clear of the rest for third. LOVER BOY TOM saved ground while settling off of the early pace, maintained a rail trip into the drive and made a mild
late gain. MALIBU GHOST stalked the pace three deep on the turn, lost ground into the stretch and was outclosed in the end. STARRY SIERRA lacked
early speed, was steered widest on the turn and improved position in the late going. NATIONWIDE PRIDE chased the pace from a two wide path on the
turn and faded in the late stages.

DRAW THE FOUL engaged with WEAR THE CROWN to dispute the early pace, edged clear of that foe nearing the quarter-marker, came under pressure
from WINTER FALCON nearing the furlong grounds but turned away that rival and kicked clear in the final stages. WINTER FALCON chased the early
pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker but was outkicked by the winner in the end, while just holding for
second. SAL N LOUIE saved ground while tracking the quick early pace, did not have a final late kick in the stretch run but just missed for second while
clear of the rest for third. BLAZING JAMIE chased the pace four wide on the turn and did not mount a late rally. ROYAL JESTER bobbled at the start, lacked
early speed, was steered three wide into the drive and was not a factor. WEAR THE CROWN broke alertly and dueled for early pace duties, pressed the
pace to the quarter-marker and faded in the late stages.

HARMON broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was well handled through the backstretch run and into the second turn, extended the lead into the
stretch and held safely in the end. NOWHERE MAN stalked the pace, was outkicked by the winner in the late stages but held for second over an oncoming
rival. AVENUE settled off of the pace, was steered four wide between foes into the stretch run, slipped to the inside for the drive, closed well late and just
missed for second. AMERICAN FARMER stalked the pace from a three wide position and was outkicked in the stretch run. FREEPORT JOE took up soon
after the start, settled off of the early pace, was steered five wide into the stretch run and was outclosed in the late going while on the left lead. MANILA

Footnotes
FOSTER BOI tracked the fast pace three wide on the turn, was roused in upper stretch, took command leaving the furlong marker and edged clear in the
end. MONSTRODAMOUS chased the pace four wide on the turn and made a good late rally in the final stages for second. KING EDDIE chased the pace
two wide, steadied in traffic midway through the turn, closed well in the late stages and just got up at the end to claim third. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET
tracked the fast pace from the inside, advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked in the end and just missed for third. ZERO BUCKS GIVEN was hustled in
the early going and pressed the fast pace through the turn, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and was outfinished late, while just missing for the
show. POTENTE ALBA was away well and was sent to set fast contested early fractions, was confronted in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages.
CONTINENTAL UNION was pinched at the start and was away slowly, was void of early speed, was four wide into the stretch and was not a threat.
LASTBESTHOPE lacked early speed, was steered widest into the stretch run and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL broke alertly and set contested fractions through the second turn, edged clear in upper stretch and held safely in the end over her
oncoming stablemate. LADY'S SERMON stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, stayed along the rail on the second turn while just off of the
pace, closed in the final furlong, vied between foes in the late stages and got up for the place in the final strides. DISTORTED QUEEN attended to the pace
while never far off of the winner, was outfinished in the drive and was just edged in the end for second. CARASYNTHIA stalked the early pace from a two
wide path, advanced on the second turn three wide and was outkicked in the stretch run. VAPING ANGEL was away a step slow leaving the gate, was
unhurried while just off of the rail, was steered three wide on the second turn, closed in the drive but was not a threat. ALESHA settled off of the pace while
saving all of the ground, rallied in the final stages but lacked the needed late response. IRISH WAHINE settled off of the early pace, was steered four wide
into the lane, made a mild late gain but was not a factor.

Footnotes
MEETMEATTHECLUB stalked the early pace, gained ground two wide on the turn, lacked room leaving the turn and into upper stretch, shifted out nearing
the furlong marker, closed in the final sixteenth and surged in the final strides to prevail. HUNTER JOHN was forwardly placed, made a steady gain on the
turn while three deep, took command into the final furlong, was firmly urged in the final stages and was nailed for the win, while besting the rest.
EXECUTIVE CHEF chased the early pace, mounted a three wide rally into the stretch run and was clear for third in the end. I'M DR. O chased the pace five
wide on the turn and made a mild late gain in the final stages. SMILING AT VAL was away slowly, lacked early speed, was steered five wide on the turn and
showed good late interest in the stretch. SECOND NATURE chased the pace four wide on the turn, lost ground into the lane and gave way in the late
stages. KERRY GOLD was fractious in the gate, was away slowly and showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and improved in the final
furlong. TIZ A THRILL pressed the pace to the quarter-marker, was overtaken by HUNTER JOHN in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. GOOD
FOCUS lacked early speed and was not a factor. BOLDACIOUS was away well and showed good early speed, was confronted nearing the quarter-marker,
was outrun into the stretch and faded in the late going. TABLE FOR TWO chased the fast early fractions from a ground saving path and tired in the stretch
run.

Footnotes
MURPHYS TIGER broke alertly and was sent to the front while in hand, set quick fractions to the turn, extended the lead nearing the quarter-marker,
continued to open the lead into the lane and was ridden out in the end as much the best. LORD BRANCUSI hit the gate at the start and was away slowly,
recovered to chase the pace two wide on the turn, closed in the final furlong and was no match for the winner in the end but was best of the rest. STORMY
CHARMANT attended to the fast early pace under a tight hold, lost ground to the winner on the turn and was outkicked in the final stages but held for the
show. SONOFAFINCH saved ground while stalking the fast pace, weakened in the stretch run and just missed for third. THE LITTLE H MAN tracked the
early pace, lost ground on the turn while three deep between runners, gave way in the drive and missed for third. JAZZ HANDS was keen early on and
steadied off heels nearing the half-mile marker, chased the pace five wide on the turn and was not a threat. OUR BOLD PRINCE was fractious in the gate,
chased the pace four wide and tired in the stretch run. SKY DINSKI lacked early speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SOUTHEAST ASIA settled off of the pace while saving ground, was asked for run four wide on the second turn, was put to firm urging through the lane and
responded to overtake KATZUMOTO nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the end. KATZUMOTO was hustled leaving the break then took back
on the first turn to stalk the pace, was roused leaving the second turn to vie for the lead nearing the furlong grounds, could not hold off the late bid from
SOUTHEAST ASIA and was outfinished by that rival but was clear of the rest for second. RUNAWAY KRISTIN settled off of the early pace while saving
ground, mounted a four wide bid leaving the second turn and rallied in the drive to get up for third. HULA KING was hustled leaving the break and attended
to the moderate pace, took a narrow lead into the final furlong and weakened in the late stages, while just missing for third. PAPPY BOYINGTON was
fractious in the gate, was away slowly and was unhurried early on, was steered four wide into the stretch and passed tiring rivals in the stretch run.
BROKEN FINGER saved ground while settling off of the pace and was not a factor. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI was sent leaving the break and stalked the
pace, improved position three wide on the second turn, lost ground into the drive and faded in the late going. SLEEP OVER was fractious in the gate, was
sent along the rail to show early speed, set contested fractions to the second turn, was caught in upper stretch and stopped in the final furlong.
