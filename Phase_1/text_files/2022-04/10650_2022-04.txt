Footnotes
MY BABYS GONE stalked the top pair down the backstretch, moved up three to four wide through the lane and just got up in his final strides under all out
pressure. RUMPUS vied for the early lead from the inside, dug in inside the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. STILL OF THE NIGHT pressed
the pace while racing two wide, raced between rivals in the stretch run and weakened a bit in the final stages. STALEMATE was hustled along early, raced
along the inside near the quarter pole, angled five wide and made a mild late gain. BODIE'SLITTLEGIRL was slow early, raced fived wide through the upper
stretch and had not enough in the drive. KITTY'S QUEEN was hustled from the outside and had no response while racing three deep. DOC'S DENITA broke
awkwardly, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. FADED MEMORIES was hustled along from the outside and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
SHE'SSKYSTHELIMIT pressed the early leader through the far turn into the upper stretch, raced along the inside in the drive, dug in late and prevailed
under all out pressure. MIDYEAR was allowed to settle from the outside, made a good four to five wide bid in the stretch run and just missed in a game
effort. BRANDONS BABE settled off the early going, waited along the inside approaching the eighth pole, angled out and closed well late.
DADDYMADEMEDOIT stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, raced three wide in the lane and had not enough late. TAHITIAN BREEZE
dropped back early, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. CHIKARA was off slowly, raced near the inside at the quarter
pole and never was a factor. RED HOT MOON stalked the pace from the outside and tired while racing between rivals. SENORITA COMETA was slow
early, raced wide through the lane and never. HAILEY'S MELODY showed good speed from the inside and gave way. The official race time was hand
timed.

COCO LOCO MAMA pressed the pace from the inside, then swung out to rally on the outside and cruise to the wire. KALLINIKI gained the lead out of the
gate and faltered at the 1/8 pole to hold on for second. FLOWER HOUSE stalked the pace, three wide and made a mild bid, but it was not enough.
NOCTURNAL MISSION was near the leaders early, two wide, and ran evenly. BOLD LEGEND was near the front early and had no late run. SHE IS A
BLING trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. MAD TABBY was mid field and dropped back in the stretch.

A SONG FOR MICKEY was off a step slow, settled off the early pace, moved up six wide through the upper stretch, finished well late and got up under
strong handling. SHER'S TEXAS BLING stalked the pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished gamely to the wire. PUT A BLING ON
IT showed good early speed to set the early pace along the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. LITESTER stalked the pace from the inside, raced
three to four wide in the lane and had not enough in the drive. SHEZA HUNK was off slowly, raced five widest through the lane and had not enough. ZOE'S
GOLDLADY settled off the early going, raced three deep and had no response. SHIASGOLD LADY raced five wide around the far turn and never was a
factor. MS. RED ROCKETTE failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
SHOW ME GRACE broke a step slow, was forwardly placed early on, took command and drew off the in stretch to be well clear while racing four deep
under steady handling. LUNAR LASS stalked the pace from the outside, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch but was no match for the
winner late. SHES NAKED stalked the early pace along the inside down the backstretch, angled out through the lane and had not enough for the top pair.
PHARME'S PHINALE was hustled along early, raced five wide through the lane and had not enough in the drive. BESSIE'S SONG coaxed along early,
raced five deep around the far turn and had no response. SI QUERE raced along the inside, moved up through the lane but never was a serious threat.
EURORICHGIRL showed good early speed and gave way. SHERRYS BABY dropped back early, raced four wide through the lane and never was a factor.
EXPECT CANDY was hustled from the inside and never threatened. SINGLE SATURDAY raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never
threatened. JIMENA dropped back early and failed to respond. OLGA'S GOLD DANCER was slow early, raced four wide through the upper lane and never
menaced.

Footnotes
PRINCESS PAULINE stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to prove best under strong
handling. NO COMMENT was allowed to settle early, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled five to six wide through the upper stretch and closed
well late to be second best. HOURGLASS FIGURE stalked the pace, raced five wide through the drive and moved up. SAGANAKI settled off the early
going, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and flattened out in the final stages. SATIN ROSE showed good early speed from
the outside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. SIGNE was unhurried early, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had not enough.
DECADE OF DREAMS was getting out in the early stages, raced up close down the backstretch and tired while racing off the inside. GLORY O lunged at
the break, stalked the pace from the outside and tired while racing five wide. MS. MORENA raced far back and never threatened.
