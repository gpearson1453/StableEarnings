MAKE A STAND stalked the leader until the second last fence, with a long run to the last he rolled off the hill to collar the leader heading into the final bend
to gain the advantage jumping the last and drew clear from there. SEVILLE BARBER showed the way until heading down the hill for the final time and
heading to the head of the stretch, dueled briefly but failed to perservere, yet was second best here. BIG CITY DREAMER settled mid pack, had mild rally
heading to the last then flattened out. ALWAYS COOL settled towards the back, failed to gain ground and was no threat here. CAINUDOTHETWIST trailed
the field.

Footnotes
GOING COUNTRY (IRE) drafted the pace for the first mile and a half, got in gear after the second last for the long run down the the hill heading for the
home turn, dueled with the pace setter at that point, had a slight advantage jumping the last and prevailed at the wire. BICKLEY took command from the
start, still had a clear advantage at the second last then was challanged by the stalker heading down the hill for the final time, dueled with that rival all the
way home and gave way in the final strides. BRIGHT EYED EAGLE (IRE) settled towards the back, rallied down the hill for the final time to be right there
jumping the last but was out run to the wire. PROJECT TWO (IRE) galloped along in the back of the field, but was never out of contention, rallied on the
home turn, then flattlened out. TOM struggled throughout the race, kept losing ground and lost touch with the field but managed to finish.

Footnotes
JUMP SHIP was in no hurry during the early going, quietly gained ground on the backside for the final time, came with a rush going down the hill after the
second last for the long run to the last, collared the leader on the home turn and dueled briefly to gain command going to the last, then opened up a wide
margin at the wire. TWENTY YEARS ON (GB) set the pace for the first mile and a half, then was challanged by hard charging JUMP SHIP going down the
hill and into the final bend, dueled briefly with that rival but was no match for the winner. DON'T SHOUT (IRE) settled mid pack, rallied after the second last
to get in the mix heading for the last then weakened after the last fence. PEAT MOSS (IRE) was close up most of the way then started to weaken going up
the hill heading for the final turn, but hung on to finish fourth. SHAKA settled mid pack and was never far out of it, rallied down the hill after the second last to
be close heading into the home turn then flattened out. FIGHTINIRISHTABIT was in contention for the first mile and a half, but could not gain further ground
during the late going. THREE O ONE was struggling in the back of the pack, continued to lose ground and was eased going down the hill for he final time
and was pulled up before the last and walked off. CRITICIZE raced mid pack started to weaken during the long run after the second last and was pulled up
before the last and walked off.

BOULETTE (IRE) took command from the beginning and controled the race on the front end and was much the best here. ANIMAL KINGSTON was always
in contention, rallied on the home turn but was no match for the winner. THE HAPPY GIANT settled in the back of the field, made mild progress going down
the hill after the long run in after the second last then flattened out. MIGHTY MARK raced towards the back, could not gain ground on the others and was no
threat here. BASSMATCHI (FR) stalked the pace setter for a mile and a half, then stopped.
