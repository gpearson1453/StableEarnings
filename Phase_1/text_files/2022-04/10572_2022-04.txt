Footnotes
UNADULTERATED showed speed, raced in the two path while outside QUEEN OF CLASS around the turn, opened up turning for home, remained on her
left lead until switching the sixteenth pole and held sway under steady handling. ELKE LODGE lacked speed, circled the turn deep, swung to the four path in
upper stretch and closed strongly. GLOWSITY , well off the inner rail while stalking the pace around the turn, failed to rally. SURYA bore out leaving the
starting gate, raced along the inner rail on the turn and was outrun. QUEEN OF CLASS , in tight quarters at the start, steadied leaving the chute, rushed up
along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, bid the lead into the turn, was finished turning for home and retreated. SHE SO COOL , caught in tight quarters
leaving the starting gate, was outrun.

Footnotes
PRINCESS COREY , close up between runners near the half mile marker, shifted in and tracked inside rivals leaving the three eighths, briefly waited mid
turn, angled out three to four wide into the lane, responded to right handed rousing and moved to overtake EL BOCHINCHE in mid stretch, spurted clear
under a drive with a sixteenth to go then held firm. LIKELY CHOICE , brushed at the start, tracked the pace while saving ground, eased back off foes
leaving the three eighths, angled out, circled rivals four to five wide into the lane and closed steadily to gain the place. EL BOCHINCHE broke a step slow
then drifted out a bit before being righted, moved up four wide into and around the far turn, moved to threaten three wide mid turn, struck the top entering
the lane, ceded the lead a furlong out then gave way grudgingly. ALWAYS SOMETHING quickly went clear, set the pace towards the rail, was joined past
the five sixteenths, battled into the lane, held willingly to mid stretch then faded. HELLO GRACIE , off the pace, raced three wide in upper stretch but lacked
a solid bid. STRIKE MAGIC stumbled at the break and brushed with a rival, dropped off the pace while saving ground and came up empty. SALAMINA
broke a step slow, rushed up soon after, chased three wide then between foes mid turn, remained in touch under pressure to the three sixteenths then gave
way.

Footnotes
JOE MIKE JIM bore out at the break, corrected and edged up towards the leaders into the turn, chased to the inside of SEA PINES mid turn, angled out for
room soon into the lane, leveled off when put to a drive, sustained and took over in deep stretch then was widening at the line. SOMMER VELVET eagerly
made her way forward along the rail and drew alongside CABRA CHICA past the five eighths, took command near the half mile pole, dueled around the
turn, shook clear under pressure past the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but could not fend off the winner. FORTUNATA ITALIA broke a step slow then
was pinched back, regrouped to moved up between runners near the half mile marker, angled out mid turn, came five wide for the drive and rallied. CABRA
CHICA sped to the front off the inside, was joined after a furlong, sparred outside SOMMER VELVET from the half mile pole to upper stretch, stayed on
willingly to mid stretch then faded. SWEET TALIA saved ground, dropped back around the turn and came up empty. SEA PINES edged up four wide
nearing the half mile marker, chased outside the winner mid turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way.

SHINY PENNY vied inside early then rated off the leader heading towards the half mile marker, stalked two to three wide under some coaxing mid turn,
closed in under a drive and took over nearing mid stretch, kicked clear and proved best while kept to task. MO FIRE , three wide outside a rival, circled into
the turn and finished up willingly to be second best. MIZ THE BEST lagged back off the inside, was hustled along from the three eighths, circled four to five
wide into the lane and finished with good energy. BON FIRE DIVA dropped in early, moved up along the rail into the lane, eased out near the three
sixteenths, checked off heels then flattened out. KYMMIES CHARDONNAY vied outside the winner before opening up heading to the turn, set the pace
under urging and off the rail, gave little resistance when confronted past the three sixteenths and tired. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT , off the pace, saved
ground into the lane and failed to menace. SALTY SAUL flashed speed inside, chased around the turn and gave way. I'M A LIL BOSSY , in the clear while
hustled mid turn, raced three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
FLYING FORTRESS , patiently rated along the inner rail for six furlongs, eased out a bit in upper stretch, took the lead outside MURPH inside the sixteenth
pole and lasted under steady handling. BELLE BELISA (IRE) , slow to begin, saved ground around the far turn, waited for room leaving the far turn, worked
between horses in the stretch and rallied inside the winner. GENNIE HIGHWAY , shuffled back soon after the break, was alertly steered to the inner rail
approaching the first turn, rated along the rail to the stretch, angled out in mid stretch and rallied outside the winner. MURPH stalked the pace down the
backstretch, gained a two wide lead leaving the far turn, opened a clear advantage, came up short and weakened. HOT CHOICE , well placed off the rail,
swung wide in upper stretch and failed to rally. DANCING TIL DUSK raced in mid pack and failed to rally. A REAL HERO stalked the pace racing along the
inner rail and weakened. DETERMINED STAR was not a factor. GET SERIOUS circled the far turn three wide and gave way. VIBRANCY , wide both turns,
was not a factor. GHOST MAIDEN was no factor. BETCHA BY GOLLY set the pace along the rail, gave way leaving the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PRINCIPALITY was steadied off rivals entering the first turn, regrouped and dropped well back off of a contested pace, advanced three wide into the lane,
split rivals with a run past mid stretch, took over late and drove clear. KNOWHOWIKNOW was sent clear early and set the pace towards the rail, met
outside bid past the three quarter pole, handled heavy pressure into the far turn and into the lane, kicked back clear under a drive in mid stretch then gave
way grudgingly. RUN ON THE TRAIL prompted the early pace while saving ground, eased back off rivals and stalked through the backstretch run, angled
out five wide approaching the stretch, moved up in mid stretch then hung late. ILLUSTRIOUS was sent up four wide into the first turn, bid three deep near
the three quarter pole, forced the issue outside runners into the far turn, kept on to remain a solid presence to mid stretch then faded. I'M NOT SLOW was
taken up out of close quarters entering the first turn, recovered and saved ground off the pace, moved up a bit while saving ground into the lane but lacked a
solid finish. GUNHAND bid between foes near the three quarter pole, pressed to the five sixteenths, failed to kick on under a strong ride and faltered.
