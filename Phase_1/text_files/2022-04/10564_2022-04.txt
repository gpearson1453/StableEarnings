Footnotes
LOVE'S MISERY went straight to the front, was well rated while setting the pace from the inside to the two path, responded well when asked coming to the
quarter-pole, came under the crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong and proved much the best under strong urging. KEMBA
was well placed just off the pace on the inside, chased along the rail on the far turn, was driven three wide the stretch, pursued the winner to the wire and
was second best. ROSEMARY POTATOES bobbled just after the start, went three wide around the opening bend, settled just off the pace, was urged along
passing the seven-sixteenths, rounded the far turn in the two path and lacked the needed response while up for the show. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE raced
with her head held high on the initial straightaway, went four wide through the first turn, settled on the outside near the back, was roused three wide on the
far turn and failed to threaten. ALICIA'S WAY bumped hard with INTELLIGENCEREPORT early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled in the
back half of the field, was urged along inside early on the far turn then shifted three wide, came four to five wide into upper stretch and was no factor.
SUMMER AT THE SPA bobbled at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, chased in the four path around the far
turn and tired. THEFABULOUS MOOLAH went around the first turn in the four path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the final
turn and came up empty. MISS INVINCIBLE traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled near the middle of the field, was urged along in the two
path around the far turn and failed to rally. INTELLIGENCEREPORT was reluctant to load, bumped hard with ALICIA'S WAY early then was taken up,
saved ground on the turns and never reached contention. EASY PLAY went three wide around both turns and showed little.

Footnotes
SUBSIDIZE moved up while urged along then chased the pace on the inside, came out into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, took the
advantage near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear late under good handling. STANHOPE was away alertly, showed the way down the backstretch, vied
inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then put to a drive in upper stretch, led into the final furlong but was overtaken by the winner while just
able to save the place. ATHENRY chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn then was driven four wide into the stretch, chased the
leader while outside into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick then just missed the place while able to get the show. PROPENSITY was coaxed
along off the pace, dropped back in the two path into and early on the turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out around the three-sixteenths,
remained on his inside lead until late before switching to the proper lead and finished willingly for the last spot in the superfecta. R BOY BODE was hustled
from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and
weakened. MO MISCHIEF brushed with a foe just after the start, settled on the outside, was guided around the turn in the five path and lacked the needed
response. TALE OF MINESHAFT settled at the rear of the field, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. CHASE THE CAT brushed with a foe just
after the start then bobbled, settled near the back, was urged three wide around the turn and failed to threaten.

speed, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch and finished with late energy to just miss the superfecta. MUSICAL AMERICA was
hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, lost the advantage
outside the quarter-pole and tired. SPEEDING KID broke a bit slow then bumped the hindquarters of a foe and dropped back, moved up into fourth position,
shifted from three to five wide while roused on the turn and came up empty.

HOT ROD RUMBLE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide
for home and bumped LOOKIN FOR TROUBLE in the hindquarters straightened away, rallied to take command a furlong out, briefly inched away before
digging on to hold safe from a late closing rival. WHO HOO THATS ME stumbled at the start getting away last, chased along the inside under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and closed well on the outside to just latch on the aforementioned foe as he hit the finish. LOOKIN FOR
TROUBLE hustled from the start, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, got bumped behind straightened away by HOT ROD RUMBLE, dug in under threat from that rival and relented a furlong out, tussled briefly before
weakening in the late stages. BIG BROWN SHOES coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths and took the inside route into upper stretch, then offered up a mild bid. BOURBON'S HOPE coaxed from the start, chased
three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MY LAST MISSION five wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, got out nine wide into upper stretch and weakened. JUMPSTER chased four to five wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. TACO BEAN five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three then two wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and never threatened.
