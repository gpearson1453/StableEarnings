MINISTER OF SOUL vied for the early lead from the inside early on, raced three wide in the lane and drove clear in the final stages. DARNQUICK stalked
the top dueling pair early, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, continued to race along the inside in the drive and finished second best. COASTAL
JAZZ pressed the early leader while racing two wide and weakened through the stretch run. THIEF IN THE NIGHT dropped back early, raced four wide near
the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. SKY T was slow early and never threatened.

Footnotes
WINNING MAGIC stalked the early pace, moved up four to three wide in the stretch and drove clear late. GONE SOMEWHERE stalked the pace from the
outside, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. REDDISH vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened
the final eighth of a mile. SOLEROCKER vied for the early lead while racing between rivals and weakened in the drive. MANCUSO AT THE MIC was
unhurried early on, raced five wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. RANCHER broke awkwardly, raced six wide near the the three
sixteenths pole and had no late rally. BALIUS dropped back early, raced four wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. OCTAVIUS PRIME
was off slowly, raced three deep and never threatened. M G M'S LUCKY raced two wide and had no response. OXBOW PARK saved ground and never
menaced.
