Footnotes
FREUDIAN SIP was hustled to the early lead inside rivals, continued on a daylight advantage and held well clear in the lane under steady handling.
BREAKIN DAYLIGHT saved ground back off the pace, moved up in the far turn but could not get to the winner in the lane. TIGER THE MAN tracked the
winner's pace three wide and lacked a final closing bid. EL CENTENARIO stalked the pace three to four wide and lacked a rally. FAYETTE WARRIOR
stalked the pace three wide and lacked a final closing run. GONE PREACHIN was not a threat. YANK CRIME saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
KENHEDOIT showed the most early speed to move inside going to the first turn and make all the pace, drew off in the far turn then was kept to urging in the
lane to widen. PHLASH DRIVE tracked the winners pace three or four wide, could not go with that one in the final quarter but held clear for his position. L B
GOLD dropped back off the pace, rallied inside through the far turn and could not threaten the top pair. BARTENDERS MISTAKE moved up four wide in the
far turn but could not threaten in the lane. WANT TO BE COWBOY saved ground in reach of the pace and weakened. NAME THE PRICE followed the pace
three wide and tired. BUMPY GAME chased the early pace two to three wide and tired.

was four and five wide with the lead group in the first turn, continued to track four wide and could not get to the winner in the lane. PAPA JOE saved ground
and moved up through the far turn then could not close the gap in the drive. PACK'N IRON was fanned seven wide out of the first turn in the lead group,
continued outside and weakened. FRONT OFFICE failed to make a bid outside. FEISTY BIRD hesitated at the break, rallied to contention outside the
winner going to the far turn but could not sustain the run. ROYAL OUTLAW was well off the rail to leave the first turn about the four path, came out going to
the far turn and took up between rivals then dropped back. NEXTPORTOFCALL was fanned six wide out of the first turn while with the lead group and tired.

DAYS OF GLORY dropped off the pace racing outside, moved up five wide to bid through the far turn and edged clear in the lane. SAILING JETT was along
the inside to bid into the far turn, continued inside DRYSPELL through that bend then drifted a bit late in the lane and gained the place. DRYSPELL made
the pace racing out from the rail, dueled outside SAILING JETT through the far turn then could not hold position in the lane. The trainer of DRYSPELL
lodged a claim of foul against the place horse alleging interference in the lane which was not allowed. SIDE STREET DAVE moved four wide to make a bid
into the far turn then could not continued the rally. TAP A MIRACLE trailed racing out from the rail and moved up late while not a serious threat. MY TRUE
REWARD stalked the pace three wide and weakened. JIMMIE T just off the early pace three or four wide, weakened.

SWINGIN' SAM showed speed to gain inside position going to the first turn, was on a contested lead inside rivals going to the far turn, edged clear into the
lane and held clear. ROCK CITY ROADHOG stalked the pace four wide to move up in the far turn and take aim at the winner but could not close the gap
late. DAAHER'S SUCCESS contested the pace between rivals to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. ASTUTE WARRIOR failed to make a
solid bid three wide. FENDER BENDER was not a threat four wide. DANZ A REBEL saved ground and was always back. DARE FELIX lunged at the break,
rushed up three and four wide to force the early pace and tired.

HIGH COST OF LIVIN moved to a clear lead racing well off the inside, was in the four path nearing the lane and held clear under steady urging. D L'S GIRL
chased the winner's pace while along the inside and slowly gained. THEWHISKEYWORKED was four and five wide in the first turn, remained outside to
rally into the lane and slowly closed the gap late. ULTRA CORDIAL was within reach four wide and lacked the needed late rally. POLLY WAR CRY broke
into the side of the gate, moved up outside to be six wide into the lane but could not reach the top ones. AQUATICA failed to mount a bid three and four
wide. POSEIDON'S MAGIC followed the pace three wide and weakened. PRUD AS PUNCH was not a factor. RHINE FALLS was finished early.

Footnotes
MAGIC REVOLUTION saved ground back off the early pace, angled out into the lane and wore down R DEJA VOO through the closing yards to be going
clear. R DEJA VOO showed speed to gain position about the two or three path, made the pace on a clear lead into the lane and could not contain the
winner late. GABBY TOM saved ground in reach of the pace, angled four wide into the lane and could not close the gap late. BOLD IMPACT was five and
six wide in the far turn to move up then came up short in the minor placings. CARIOCA was in each of the pace four wide but lacked a final closing bid.
PERVASIVE moved up three and four wide while not a threat. KING WITT failed to make a bid three wide. RUN FOR MATTY was five to seven wide
through the first turn and was always back. SIR BARNABUS showed speed outside the early leader to prompt the pace and tire. KID WINMOR was finished
early.

HOLD TIGHT followed the pace while saving ground to midway up the backstretch, rallied inside the leaders to bid and move clear going to the final turn,
drew off into the lane then was put to lefthanded urging late. INTREPID HEART settled back off the pace two and three, moved four wide to bid in late
backstretch then could not go with the winner in the lane. WRATH made the pace racing out from the rail while inside ITS A WRAP, edged clear in the
second turn then had little left once headed going to the final turn. CONVENTION lagged well back off the pace saving ground and passed only beaten
ones. ITS A WRAP prompted the pace outside WRATH through the opening half mile and tired going up the backstretch. STEPHEN'S ANSWER stalked the
leaders outside to bid four wide between calls going up the backstretch but tired and finished far back.
