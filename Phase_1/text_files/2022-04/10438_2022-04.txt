Footnotes
KNOCKON stalked the pace, rallied on the turn, went six wide at the top of the stretch, dueled for the lead and inched away late to prove best. LITTLE LILY
LU stalked the pace, angled out on the turn, bid five wide between horses, was crowded and steadied at the top of the stretch, closed willingly once clear
and was outfinished in a good effort. STORMY GALE pressed the pace while racing two wide, challenged for the lead on the turn, dueled to late stretch,
hung late and held safely for show. TEQUILA RITA was void of early speed, raced outside, offered a mild bid only and was not a threat. CRITICAL
CONDITION set a pressured pace to the turn, responded to duel past the eighth pole and faltered to lose position. FULLY COMPLIANT lacked a bid in an
inside trip. There was a stewards' inquiry and a rider's claim of foul concerning possible interference at the top of the stretch. No change was made.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF MAMA was hustled along to vie to the turn, inched away for a short lead and held under urging. MICHELLE WHO stalked the pace, bid between
horses on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch, went willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late and held for place. DODROPIN stalked the pace,
rallied four wide on the turn, was carried out entering the stretch, bid, hung late and just lasted for show. BRIO IS AWESOME saved ground, angled out in
the upper stretch, found her best stride late and was gaining fast and outnodded for third. BLUE GESSAMI pressed two across to the turn, fell back and
finished evenly. KID CAT showed speed to the turn, dropped back and was not a threat. NAVARONES SPARKLE was crowded at the start and outrun. The
stewards' posted an inquiry and there was a rider's objection concerning the start. No change was made.

Footnotes
SAINT PIEUS advanced around the turn, swung wide, angled back in in the upper stretch and closed through traffic to get up in the final strides. POVERTY
BAY bid inside on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead, led to deep stretch and was outclosed. COASTAL KING saved ground, bid along
the rail on the turn to get within rangle, lacked the needed late rally and held for show.. RED HURRICANE broke sharply, swung wide and was carried out
on the turn, bid and hung. SPINNING RED was slow early, offered a mild bid inside and improved position. DARK N' HANDSOME settled off the pace,
showed speed to the turn and gave way. SHAMAN CHIEF was not a factor. MEMOLOTSAMISCHIEF was sent to the front, led to the turn, swung wide and
gave way. LETHAL ALEXANDER ducked in at the start and trailed the field.

Footnotes
SLY raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn to challenge, was in tight near the eighth pole while dueling for the lead and drew clear late.
NOLONGERAHOBBY set the pace, drew off on the turn, responded when challenged to duel, was in tight near the eighth pole and yielded late fo finish
second best. WE'RE JUST SAYIN was allowed to settle, saved ground and offered a mild bid only to be along for show. TW SKIPPING STONES raced mid
pack in an outside trip, showed speed to the turn, tired and dropped back. PROVOST was outrun in an even effort. GOLDEN TIGER went five wide on the
first turn, lacked a response and did not threaten. MANY ROSES vied inside, was through after a half and stopped. The trainer of NOLONGERAHOBBY
lodged an objection against the rider of SLY for alleged interference near the eighth pole. No change was made.

six wide at the top of the stretch and closed steadily to get up for show. TESTING THE WATERS raced close to the pace, bid along the rail on the turn and
hung late. ADD ON showed speed to the turn and gave way. PAITASKA saved ground, angled out on the turn, went seven wide and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
TRES CHIFLADOS vied to turn, drew off for a clear lead and held well. ARIZONA JEREMY was never far back, rallied on the turn to loom a threat, lacked
the needed late response and finished second best. PARLEY STREET was slow early, swung wide entering the stretch and closed to get up for show. TOP
ROCKET pressed the pace while racing inside, angled out on the turn, bid and came up empty. JAKE THE GREAT vied between horses to the turn and
stopped. HAVE A LIL PEPPER trailed the field, offered a mild bid and improved position. ZOMBIE ALAN was outrun in an even effort. OMACHE KID raced
outside and had brief speed only. I AM ALLTHATYOUARE vied inside to the turn and gave way.
