AWESOME INCENTIVE stalked the earlier pace from the three path, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail,
dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear toward the wire. RONA took the lead two deep at the five eighths pole and rated the pace, came under
pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug in leaving the turn, but was caught in later yards. COOKIE DUNK DUNK
saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail most of the far turn, angled to the five path approaching the top of the stretch and
came along for third mid-stretch. WILLOW'S CHARM saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
showed little further. TOUCH OF HER HAND stalked the pace off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole then weakened off the rail on
the far turn. AMARETTO SOUR rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn.
FORT ZANNA rounded the opening turn about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
UPHEAVAL accelerated to the front at the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, widened at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady
encouragement and just lasted, although, he sustained a fatal injury past the finish line, fell, and had to be euthanized on the track. GRAND FIBER gave
chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in from the head of the lane to take second mid-stretch and just missed. RESIDENT gave chase inside, ran at
the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and finished well to take third the final yards. BARRY KARAFIN BETS chased and rounded the turn about the
three path then flattened stride the final sixteenth. BUCKED TOOTH gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and ran evenly
through the lane. NOT A TRICK pressured the pace through the backstretch but dropped back at the rail at the quarter pole, weakened inside the eighth
pole, fell over Upheaval past the wire but got up walked off. EPIC WEST was never a factor.
