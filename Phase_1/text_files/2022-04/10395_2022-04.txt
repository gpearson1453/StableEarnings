NO MORE MASK , quickly to a forward position, bid three deep nearing the half mile marker, dueled in hand and to the outside of RUBI DE LEON around
the turn, was roused clear soon into the lane, drifted in towards the rail nearing the eighth pole then held firm while kept to task. HEIDI T , taken to rate off
the leaders, gained under asking to the inside of rivals nearing the five sixteenths, shifted out and had aim four wide into the lane, continued willingly but
was second best. MIZ THE BEST lacked speed, was under a ride three wide approaching the stretch, swung wider and had some late interest to nab the
show. LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT , three to four wide with pursuit, moved up some nearing the lane, stayed on her left lead and came up empty. RUBI DE
LEON sped to the front and set the early pace two wide, was joined from both sides nearing the half mile marker, dueled inside the winner around the turn,
stayed on to upper stretch then faded. I'M A LIL BOSSY broke a bit slowly, was sent up to the inside of rivals and challenged for the lead early on, was
shuffled back near the three and a half furlong pole, regrouped to pursue to the five sixteenths then weakened.

Footnotes
AWESOME STEPHEN took some early pressure then went clear nearing the half mile marker, was nicely rated towards the rail, dug in when meeting an
outside challenge mid turn, held grimly while dueling past the furlong grounds, shook clear under a drive leaving the sixteenth marker and held sway.
PLAYING GOLD tracked the leaders three wide, shifted wider for the drive and made a grinding run to close the gap. BISCOTTO D'ORO rushed up inside
foes the join the early pace fray, angled out leaving the far turn, bid to engage the winner, dueled past mid stretch but was out kicked. DOLICE VITA broke a
step slow, sped up early and forced the issue, dropped back a bit under pressure around the turn, saved ground into the lane and came back willingly
through the final sixteenth. GIOVANNY'S HONOR settled off the pace, moved up outside a rival mid turn, angled six wide for the drive but failed to kick on.
ALREADY THERE , sluggish from the gate, was outrun.

KRACHENWAGEN vied three deep into the first turn, eagerly went clear soon into the backstretch, dropped in and moved away while under some rating,
opened up a commanding lead while still confidently handled approaching the stretch, was given his cue soon after, wandered outward a bit under left
handed asking in mid stretch and proved dominant while kept to urging. PERCHER saved ground off the pace, came under a ride when edging up near the
half mile pole, angled three wide nearing the stretch, churned on willingly and gained the place. GHOST STALKER settled well off the rail, angled in leaving
the far turn, chased PERCHER past the five sixteenths, stayed inside and continued with some interest. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME vied between runners into
the first turn, raced in closest pursuit through the backstretch run, was under asking past the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. EDICT
gave early chase three wide and tired. HAYNE'S FEVER had speed to the inside of runners, rated back near the seven eighths, was taken off the inside,
lost touch past the five eighths, drifted out and tired.

Footnotes
MUCHACHO MACHO pulled his way forward early and tracked a trio about four wide, ranged up six wide outside the embattled leaders into the lane and
took a short lead soon after, briefly went clear, responded when set down nearing mid stretch, dug in when meeting an inside threat from COOKE
BROTHERS, dueled with that one under strong handling and prevailed in gritty fashion. COOKE BROTHERS advanced under rating and towards the inside
heading to the far turn, awaited room while boxed in mid turn, worked outward and found a seam past the three sixteenths, joined the winner to his inside,
sparred gamely to the wire and just mjissed. TAPPIN FOR GLORY settled off the pace and off the inside, took closer order under pressure mid turn, swung
out very wide and kept on with interest. JUST PICK ONE , with the pace three deep, bid five wide between runners into the lane, dueled on near even terms
past the quarter pole, shied inward a bit when COOKE BROTHERS worked between foes in mid stretch then faded. SHOULDA HAD IT got involved with
the pace early on and between rivals, remained between runners disputing the pace into and around the turn, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and
weakened. SEIZE THE DAY rushed up inside leaving the chute and poked a head in front leaving the three quarter pole, vied inside rivals into and around
the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way. HE'S NOT CURLY rated off the pace and to the inside of a rival leaving the far turn, faltered soon into
the stretch and wandered outward.

Footnotes
DUNE DUNE sped to a short lead towards the inside, handled outside pressure, shook clear into the lane, opened up under a drive in mid stretch, drifted
out some late and prevailed. CHAUFFEUR , in the clear and off the dueling leaders, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, angled four wide into the
lane, leveled off to his best stride past the eighth pole, closed gamely and just failed to get up. CALLYOURIGHTBACK disputed the pace outside the winner,
failed to match strides past the three sixteenths and faded. DOUBLBARRELBOURBON drifted in a bit and bumped with a rival at the break, settled off the
pace, steadied off of a rival into the turn, saved ground into the stretch, eased out late and rallied. INDEFATIGABLE came in when rank soon after the
break, corrected and sent up to force the pace three deep, angled in approaching the stretch and gave way grudgingly. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE , bumped
and in tight at the break, raced off the pace, circled four wide into the stretch and failed to generate a legitimate kick. I WANT MORE , in tight at the break,
raced inside rivals near the half mile marker, angled three wide, had a belated kick but failed to menace. FLAT CAT , bumped and in close at the break, was
urged along off the rail and failed to recover. NEVERFOLD , wide, was not a factor.

MILTON THE MONSTER vied between rivals while under nice rating, put a head in front past the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up soon into the
lane, shook clear near mid stretch, eagerly opened under left handed pressure then was flashed the whip through the final seventy yards. ARTHUR'S HOPE
edged up to the inside of a pair of runners soon after the break and disputed the pace, gained a short lead past the five eighths, emerged in a fight with the
winner into the lane, failed to kick on with that one in mid stretch, altered out soon after and kept on gamely while on his left lead to hold down the place.
KARAN'S NOTION , well placed outside rivals and off a three way duel, took closer order leaving the three eighths, angled five wide under a ride into the
lane but failed to seriously respond. WHISKEY AND YOU , sent up between rivals early, chased three wide mid turn but lacked a bid. BOBBY G drafted
back off the pace and saved ground, remained inside while under pressure into the lane but failed to make an impact. HUNTER JOE disputed the pace
three deep, was out kicked into the lane and gave way. MCCAIN , off the pace, angled five wide and failed to menace.

SUMMER ODDS settled early while off the rail and off of a contested pace, took up chase three wide leaving the far turn, moved swiftly to command near
the five sixteenths, opened up a clear advantage soon into the lane, drifted in from right handed asking inside the furlong grounds then held firm while
steadily hand ridden to the wire. FORTES rated off the pace about three wide, angled in a bit entering the lane, advanced between runners inside the eighth
pole and finished with good energy. HUFFLEPUFF stalked the pace, came four wide for the drive, advanced to the outside of FORTES nearing the
sixteenth pole and kept on trying. SPANIKOPITA lost ground four to five wide, circled under pressure into the lane and kept on with some interest.
ARCHER'S HALL sped up to the inside and took command, set a pressured pace towards the rail, could not fend off the winner past the five sixteenths, dug
in and stayed on willingly past the furlong pole then faded. LUCKY US was nudged up to contention and forced the pace outside ARCHER'S HALL, had no
response leaving mid turn and weakened. TOSS A COIN gave early chase towards the rail and faltered.

MAUREENLOVESFRANK , between horses leaving the five eighths, picked up some momentum heading for the lane, shifted out, made a grinding run
under solid handling and forged to command outside rivals in the final strides. DEVILISH AFFAIR saved ground, angled three wide with run into the lane,
ranged up to have aim on the winner in mid stretch, continued with effort and got the place between rivals. UNREQUITED LOVE opened up early, set the
pace towards the inside, wandered outward holding a short lead under pressure in mid stretch, held on past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly in
the final yards. ESCAPE FUND rated back off the pace and three deep leaving the five eighths, was under asking mid turn while three to four wide, shifted
out wider in the lane but failed to generate the needed run. SONG OF HONOR , well back early while under a ride, came two wide for the drive but lacked a
serious run.

BEDTIMEBOURBON relaxed four wide while not too far back, crept closer mid turn while under asking, remained four wide into the lane, leveled off under
left handed asking past the furlong grounds and forged to command between runners in the final strides. PATRIA quickly went clear, set the pace towards
the rail, turned away a challenge around the turn, opened up under a drive nearing mid stretch, kept on gamely but just failed to hold off the winner.
GUSTAV'S GIRL lost ground five wide, continued five wide advancing into the lane, ranged up outside rivals to loom boldly with a sixteenth to go but hung
in the final jumps. CUSH EFFECT , squeezed back at the break, edged up and angled in leaving the far turn, moved up to loom a danger while saving
ground past the three sixteenths, chased inside rivals near the sixteenth pole then was out finished. ISABELLA'S GLORY dropped off the pace, raced three
wide into the lane, shifted out but only had a mild late kick. IF THEN , three wide between runners nearing the half mile marker, failed to keep up mid turn,
angled in and faded. ALL WORKED UP prompted the pace two wide, went after the leader mid turn, failed to kick on into the lane and faltered.
