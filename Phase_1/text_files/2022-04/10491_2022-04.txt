Footnotes
MY FINAL TRICK was well placed early on the inside, then shifted out on the turn to make a three wide move, went on even terms leaving the turn and drew
clear in the furlong grounds to prove best under right handed crop urging. LIME was bumped at the start, then was sent to the front to set the pace moving
to the inside, then was headed leaving the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award. SOMEONE ELSE chased the early
pace and was three wide by the quarter pole and finished willingly to just miss the place award. FINDING PERFECTION hit the gate coming out and
bumped a rival at the start, then was settled on the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside in the drive but had no rally. SAVVY'S SISTER lacked a rally.

Footnotes
LIGHT THE LAMP set a pressured pace early on the inside, then shook clear on the turn and widened the margin by the furlong marker, then maintained a
safe margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. UNCLE JOE chased the early pace and was on the inside on the turn, angled out nearing the furlong
marker and rallied well late but could not get to the winner while clearly second best. CALL MY BANKER stalked the early pace towards the inside, made a
two wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then steadied slightly by the furlong marker, flattened out, held show award. INVISIBLE FRIEND broke awkwardly at
the start, then chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out. SUMMER SUNSET pressed the early pace three wide and then
was empty in the drive. OCTOBER FROST was reserved early, then was on the inside on the turn and lacked a rally.

OL' BLONDIE tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, went on even terms leaving the turn and slowly edged clear to prove

CHANCEL set the early pace on the inside, then dueled for command by the quarter pole, then shook clear again the drive and held sway late to prove best
under a drive. NIKOLAOU chased the early pace on the inside, angled out in the drive and rallied well late. ICING stalked the early pace three wide, made a
four wide bid on the turn, then was bumped by the furlong marker and hung late while getting the nod fro the show award. COMMANDER JOE chased the
early pace and was two wide by the quarter pole, shifted out four wide by the furlong marker, bumped ICING and then was in tight between horses by the
sixteenth pole and just missed the show award. RED MERCURY pressed the winner and made a three wide bid on the turn but could not sustain that bid
and was bumped by the sixteenth pole while fading. JIMMIES BIG DAY was rated early and made a five wide move on the turn but came up empty in the
drive. The STEWARDS posted an INQUIRY concerning the run in the stretch, after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

BEAUTIFUL EMPIRE was bumped at the start, reserved early, made a five wide move on the turn and then drew off in the stretch to prove much the best
while being ridden out. SWEET CAROLENA was reserved early, came six wide into the drive, rallied well to be along for the place. STERLING SPEED was
settled early, came four wide into the lane, came in slightly nearing the furlong marker, then was along for the show award late. FAST COREY dueled for the
lead two wide and weakened in the drive, lost show award late. WICKED MIAH was settled back early, came seven wide into the drive and had a belated
rally. EVER SO D'WILD was settled on the inside, tipped out three wide nearing the furlong marker and had no rally. TAKOTA was well placed early and
made a inside bis on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole and weakened. TAKE IT EASY was settled three wide early and then dropped back,
was not asked in the lane after avoiding fallen rival. GOLDEN GARTER broke in at the start and failed to menace. FOREST DRIFT dueled for the early lead
three wide and faded by the quarter pole, then clipped heels by the furlong marker and fell, walked off after being caught by the outriders. The STEWARDS
posted an INQUIRY concerning the stretch run and after reviewing the replays the race was left as is.

DREAMING OF DREW dueled for the early lead two wide, then dropped down to the inside in the stretch, fought back gamely late to be resurgent to prove
best under a drive. JEANIE B (GB) tracked the early pace from between horses, then made a three to four wide bid leaving the turn, went on even terms for
command bearing the furlong marker but was out-gamed late to just miss. OUR SECRET AGENT was bumped at the start, chased the pace on the inside,
swung out four wide leaving the turn and finished willingly but needed more. IMAGERY was settled early and raced four wide and had no rally. IMA BEAST
chased the early pace three wide and came five wide into the drive but was empty in the drive. NIKEE KAN dueled for the early lead on the inside and
weakened.

Footnotes
JOKERS RUN was rated five wide early, made a six wide move on the turn and came seven wide into the lane, continued that move and drew clear to
prove best under a drive. INFINITE PASSION chased the early pace in between horses, came four wide into the lane and finished well to gain the place
award. HUMORUS HOLIDAY was bumped at the start, then steadied early from between horses, swung out six wide leaving the turn and had a late rally.
FREE CARRYCOMB stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn but faded in the final furlong. HALLANVAARA was outrun early on
the inside, angled out in mid stretch and had a belated rally. DISTORTED SUCCESS stalked the pace three wide and weakened. SASSYWITHATTITUDE
set the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive. BLACK TAFFY was well placed early on the inside, then was blocked and had to check by the
sixteenth pole and lost all chance.
