KACHINA tracked the leaders from the three path made a late stretch run to close fastest to clear late under a steady drive. FEELIN MY OATS was hustled
to the lead to set all the pace but was caught at the wire. SHE'S A PLAYER vied for the lead but lacked the late response. SHEZONEZESTREET broke well
but was slow into stride then had to make another bid for contention and flattened out. OH NIKI was placed just off the pace early then dropped back.

pack then made a four wide bid into the stretch and had his best strides late. GRANITO DE ORO raced in the middle of the pack then made a move on the
turn from four wide and was able to get up for the show. SOLDIER'S FIGHT was rushed to contention and steadily retreated. LA' HOPPER vied for the lead
from the inside but failed to menace. KEETOOWAH THUNDER had the early speed but gave way. DREAMS AFFIRMED was near the back but was never
a factro. DON'T BUG ME was never a threat. GOSPEL SPARTAGUS was hard to load, broke slowly and trailed.

Footnotes
CALCULATING KING stalked the pacesetting duo into and the bend from a three wide stance, was roused nearing the quarter pole, angled out at upper
stretch and finished under a stiff drive for the score. HE'S MUNNIE finished willingly and held onto the place after tucking to the inside shortly after the start
to save ground and giving chase from the second flight. CANEY'S GHOST settled into the second flight and between rivals along the backstretch and
around the turn, was asked for a rally at upper stretch and came up empty. MAN U rushed from outset and established a two wide pose while setting the
pace in tandem aong the backstretch, gained command breifly at upper stretch, but was unable to sustain the bid in the final furlong. CATALE STORM was
unhurried and gave chase from a back rated stance before passing a tiring foe in the late strides. CABOT TRAIL eclipsed rapidly in the final stages after
flashing early foot and leading the field along the backstretch. WILL KNOWS trailed from outset and failed to threaten.
