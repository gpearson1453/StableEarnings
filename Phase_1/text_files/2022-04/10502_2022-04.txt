Footnotes
TOWN DRUNK was forwardly placed in the two path just off the leader then gained the lead at the quarter pole and drew off. LASTCALLFORALCOHOL set
the clear pace for three quarters then was headed at the eighth pole then he made a rebid and was able to hold on to the place. COOL CATOMINE was
allowed to settle while racing two wide then moved out to three wide on the turn but flattened out in the drive. POP CULTURE was well placed on the inside
then angled out on the turn to make a bid but lacked the late response needed. GOT MOJO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside but failed to
menace. THAT'S WHAT I SAY was never a threat. HUMOR'S REWARD raced near the back and was not a factor. RACE WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

FLY TO THE BANK stalked the early pacesetting trio from a wide pose, circled the leaders three wide near the quarter pole and kicked clear in the final
furlong. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR hustled from outset for early command, saved ground through the bend, and finished willingly but was unable to fend off the
rally of eventual winner in final furlong. EUROBOND disputed the pace as the outer most rival of three abreast along the backstretch, was within striking
distance at the top of the stretch, but failed to match strides with top pair in the closing stages. GRADESTER came up empty in late portion of contest after
dueling for early command from between rivals and tucking to an inside pose at upper stretch. WESTPORT failed to threaten and gave chase from a back
rated stance. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

OUR CORNERSTONE was forwardly placed just off the leaders angled out at the head of the stretch and gained the lead at the eighth pole and drew clear.
HUNTER'S LEGACY dueled for the lead from the two path then inched away at the quarter pole to be caught at the sixteenth pole to be a clear second. MY
REAL DIAMOND dueled for the lead from the three path and weakened late in the stretch. A FLICKER OFSILVER dueled for the lead from the four path
and gave way. OKLAHOMA LINE chased the leaders while racing five wide throughout but had no impact. OSO PRIETO was hard used early to duel from
the inside and tired after three sixteenths. FIVE FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME IS NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
