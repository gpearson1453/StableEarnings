Footnotes
MAGIC SOLUTION led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, extended his lead while saving ground around the far turn,
and continued to draw off while drifting out in the final furlong. SPECIAL CONQUEST trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn, moved up to
race in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path racing around the second turn and chased the winner home, the best of
the rest. AKA LIONESS raced in the three path between horses around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the
far turn from the two path and finished evenly while proving to be no match for the top two. PEYOTE PEGGY pressed the pace from the two path around the
first turn, dropped back to chase the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the second bend and faded entering the stretch. JANE'S GOLD
TOUR stalked the leader while racing four wide around the first turn, dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and
continued to tire from there.

PO BOY was hustled for early speed, disputed the early pace outside of FAMA Y DINERO, cleared into the turn, was confronted by FAMA Y DINERO to his
outside past the seven sixteenths, turned him back into the lane, and held sway while all out. MINISTRY OF ART broke well, settled back to chase the
leading pair inside, hugged the rail with the rear pair around the turn, bid inside into the lane, angled out in upper stretch, chased on under a drive and was
gaining late. ON THE MUSCLE was bumped by FAMA Y DINERO in the opening strides, chased the leading pair between horses early, raced two wide in
the rear pair around the bend, was urged two wide into the lane, and chased on evenly for show while drifting out. FAMA Y DINERO broke out and bumped
ON THE MUSCLE in the opening strides, disputed the early pace inside of PO BOY, switched out near the seven sixteenths and bid two wide on PO BOY,
loomed until turning four wide into the lane and flattened. SMART TRIAL was fractious in the gate, chased the leading pair three deep early, bid three wide
past the seven sixteenths, raced three wide into upper stretch and emptied out from the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
SPALDING STROLL settled at the rear of the main group early, chased in the two to three path on the turn, was driven approaching the three sixteenths,
dropped to the rail approaching the furlong mark and responded with a rally, rolled to the lead inside the dueling pair near the sixteenth mark, and cleared.
BIG MERRILL was carried out between horses early as a result of IRONMAN RICHIE breaking outward, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and
while saving ground around the turn, was taken four wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive, met the dueling pair near the sixteenth pole but was
outkicked by SPALDING STROLL. IRONMAN RICHIE broke outward, was sent for speed, set the early pace while pressured by GET THEM DIGITS to his
outside, dueled inside of that foe around the turn and into the lane, brushed several times with GET THEM DIGITS during the pace battle, had no answer
when SPALDING STROLL and BIG MERRILL descended near the sixteenth pole but chased on to hold the show. GET THEM DIGITS was carried out in
the opening strides, pressed the early pace outside of IRONMAN RICHIE, dueled two wide around the turn, continued to battle on the pace down the lane
while intermittently brushing with that foe, and flattened out in the final sixteenth. CALICO JOE settled well behind the main group, raced in the five path
around the turn, was driven six wide in upper stretch and passed tiring horses in upper stretch. POQUITO MAN dwelt at the start, saved ground around the
turn, regained touch with the rear of the field into upper stretch but lacked the needed rally in the lane. GALLI ATTACK tracked the leading pair two wide
early, began to flatten out near the half, raced in the four path on the turn, raced between horses in the rear flight, and proved empty.

Footnotes
PALM COURT tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the three path while racing around the turn, dueled
gamely down the lane and pulled ahead late. KHOZYS CROWN hit the gate leaving it, stalked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began a bid
from the two path passing the three eighths pole, dueled down the stretch and gave way in the final strides, the best of the rest. PRINCESS CONSUELA
raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and chased the top two home, no match for those rivals. AH LEAH raced
in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, improved position mildly in the lane and was outfinished.
SENORITA AURORA trailed the field on the rail up the backstretch and around the turn, steadied and switched to the outside near the eighth pole, brushed
with CHICKADEE shortly after, and was no threat. CHICKADEE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn,
began to weaken in upper stretch, brushed lightly with SENORITA AURORA near the sixteenth pole and tired further from there.

Footnotes
GITA'S LAD set the pace inside, took pressure from SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE from the three quarters until near the half, set a clear pace while saving
ground on the far turn, increased his advantage when pushed along in upper stretch, and stayed on under a drive despite drifting out. WILD FOX chased
well off the leading pair, was pushed along into the far turn and drew closer up the rail, raced in range two wide in upper stretch, could not get to the
pacesetter but chased on willingly and narrowly held the place. CHRISTIAN C soon trailed, began to take closer order while saving ground around the far
turn, went to a drive near the five sixteenths, sustained his rally up the inside in the lane, and just missed the place. TAP THE MOJO settled near the rear,
edged forward into the backstretch to join outside WILD FOX while well behind the leading pair, took closer order in tandem with that foe into the turn, went
to a drive near the three eighths, floated into the six path in upper stretch, and flattened out. SOUPER HIGHVOLTAGE tracked the leader while racing
keenly around the first turn, pulled forward to join outside of GITA'S LAD near the three quarters, pressed the pace down the back straight, settled back
again to stalk the leader while positioned two wide on the far turn, proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, and weakened three wide.

WHAT'S UP DUDE raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole,
switched to the outside in upper stretch and gained ground down the lane to pull clear late. LIKE A SALTSHAKER chased the leaders from the middle of the
pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, gained ground outside in upper stretch, took over with a furlong to go and was caught in the
final sixteenth while drifting out late. AGGRESSIVITY raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the
turn in the two path, swung out entering the stretch and passed tiring horses in late stretch. FORE LEFT dueled for the lead on the inside up the
backstretch, continued to battle from the two path while setting fast fractions around the turn and into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. MALPAIS set a
quick pace while dueling from the rail up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and tired through what remained of the

Footnotes
HIGH BROW broke last but was urged for early position, engaged outside the leading pair near the seven sixteenths, attended three wide, headed BIG
TIPPER near the five sixteenths, drifted out in upper stretch, nonetheless kept on, and opened up his lead further after feeling the crop once near the
sixteenth. BIG TIPPER was bumped by SWEET TONIC in the opening strides, set a pressured pace inside, was headed by HIGH BROW near the five
sixteenths, dug in gamely, continued to keep on doggedly along the inside in the lane when put to a drive, and proved no match in the final sixteenth. KING
ZION settled near the rear, made mild improvement while saving ground around the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and chased on best of the rest
while drifting out. COAL TOWN ROAD chased the leading line early, was pushed along from midpack while three wide on the turn, went to a drive near the
five sixteenths, swung into the lane in the five path, and lacked the needed kick. EL ROMANTICO settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn and into
the lane, and had no late rally inside. SWEET LITTLE RUE was sent for pace, found himself outsprinted from the five eighths, gradually flattened two wide
on the turn, raced into the lane in the five path and proved empty in the lane. SWEET TONIC broke inward and bumped BIG TIPPER in the opening strides,
pressed the pace outside of that foe down the back straight and between horses into the turn, could not keep up with BIG TIPPER and HIGH BROW from
the three eighths, and continued to weaken in the lane.
