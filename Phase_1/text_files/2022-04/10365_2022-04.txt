Footnotes
NORTHERN QUEST stalked the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-sixteenths pole, vied with ROYAL SEEKER through a
prolonged drive and proved best in the closing yards. ROYAL SEEKER pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
quarter, responded when challenged by the winner into the lane, vied with that rival and just missed through a vigorous drive. SOUTH FRESNO was void of
early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn, angled in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished evenly late. PRICE TO PAY settled off the
leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. SWAGSATIONAL was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through
the second turn and weakened. APPROVED was away in good order to set a pressured pace and weakened after going three-quarters. DISPUTED lagged
early, raced four-wide through the second turn, did not reach contention, was unsaddled on the back-stretch and vanned off.

CENTRAL PARK was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached STONE CARVER nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
vied with that rival and was up in the final yards. STONE CARVER was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear
margin nearing the three-eighths marker, responded when challenged by the winner into the lane, vied with that rival and just missed. MR PAYTIENCE was
reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late. RACE
HOME lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. GREEK GEEK was void of early speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and did not threaten. CHASING FAME showed no early speed, raced through the turn and did not menace. DARNQUICK raced off the leaders
early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. RICKEY B lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore in tandem with LOLLY EXPRESS nearing
the sixteenth pole and edged away from that rival through the closing yards. LOLLY EXPRESS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the second turn, reached the leaders nearing the sixteenth pole, vied with the winner but could not match strides late. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN
was never far back, saved ground through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. BOB'S ALL IN disputed the pace while racing three-wide and
gave way through the final furlong. REAL GLITTER was away in good order to vie for the lead from the inside and gave way after going three-quarters.
BLOW MY MIND was off a step slow then pulled to contend, pressed the pace while racing four-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. THE RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.
