Footnotes
EQUULEUS tracked the pace four wide, closed steadily and was up in deep stretch. AWESOME CRUSADER stalked the pace from the rail, got through in
upper stretch, took the lead inside of foes nearing the eighth pole, edged ahead of the pacesetters but could not withstand the winner. ADIOS GARY
pressed the pace in the three path, reached near even terms in upper stretch but was outfinished. REGIMENTAL COMMAND set the pace in the two path
and weakened between foes in the final furlong. THE MAR chased the pace two wide and lacked a rally. TRAPPE THE WIND had his head turned at the
start, and was outrun while racing two wide. TRAVELINGBLUESMAN saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and never threatened.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

HIERRO grabbed the early lead inside, shook off pursuers on the turn, entered the stretch in the three-path, and was driving to 70 yards out. KING CAIRO
advanced into second under a drive on the turn, could not make an impression on the leader four wide into the lane, and ran on clearly second best.
BEINFUN saved ground into the stretch, and lacked a solid closing bid. PROSPECT PROJECT pressed HIERRO early, and was finished midway on the
turn. BIG CITY RED trailed throughout, and jogged in.

finished willingly for the place. TORA LORA LORA trailed in the two path around the turn, tipped outside in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally and was

and weakened. LATTE LOVER lacked a rally three wide. BANKING ON YOU raced four wide and never menaced. SUNDAY SUZANNE showed speed two
wide for three furlongs, and tired. MUDSHAFT was outrun three to four wide. HAPPY'S NICE CANDY never reached contention. RAVEN'S HARLAQUEEN

Footnotes
POSITIVELY AWESOME broke outwardly and bumped FLIPPING FISH at the start, sped to the front, set a pressured pace in the two path, shook clear in
upper stretch, held clear to deep stretch and just lasted. LITTLE DEMON settled off the early pace outside, advanced five wide around turn, closed outside
and just missed. NIXON JOY (ARG) lacked early speed, raced three and four wide around the turn, rallied through the lane and was up for the show in the
final strides. MENELIK pressed the winner in the three path for six furlongs and weakened a bit in the lane. MAN ON THE MOON stalked the pace four wide
and lacked a rally. DIMENNA chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. FLIPPING FISH was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never
threatened. ALMASHRIQ advanced inside down the backstretch, retreated around the turn and was vanned off after the finish.

Footnotes
FIRST RULE went clear early, responded when hooked from outside by AMPERSAND on the turn, dug in through a long drive and held on while drifting out
some. AMPERSAND got out bumping ROAN MOUNTAIN early, went up to challenge FIRST RULE midway on the turn, battled through the stretch while
being carried out a bit and could not get past. HERCULES saved ground early, moved out three wide approaching the stretch, stayed on willingly and was
gaining late outside the top two. BRACCIO DI FERRO steadied behind ROAN MOUNTAIN early, was outrun to the turn four wide, stayed on well and was
gaining late on the far outside. ROAN MOUNTAIN steadied getting squeezed back between AMPERSAND and the loose horse leaving the chute, moved
inward approaching the stretch, and had no final rally on the rail. NACHO PAPA showed early speed two wide, and faded steadily after a half-mile.
CHUCKY stumbled badly and unseated the rider at the start, was apprehended and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START
BEFORE THE RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL.

Footnotes
FRANKLY MY DEAR broke a step slow, hustled up to vie early inside SEA ART and FOXY LADY, shook those two off leaving the backstretch, lost the lead
to AMERICAN OF COURSE soon after entering the turn, battled back to reach even terms by the top of the stretch, and withstood a long drive on the rail to
prevail. AMERICAN OF COURSE bumped with MANUELA soon after the start, moved fast from outside to take the lead after entering the turn, dueled
outside FRANKY MY DEAR through the length of the stretch and was outgamed. NO DECAF broke out bumping MANUELA after the start, raced three to
four wide on the turn, stayed on task through the lane and was gaining late outside rivals. FOXY LADY pressed the early pace outside, could not match
strides with the leaders under a drive after a half-mile, then stayed on with good late courage between horses. FREAK moved in from the three-path
approaching the stretch, and had no closing bid on the rail. QUEEN CAMILLA broke a step slow, and failed to factor toward the inside. MANUELA bobbles
at the break, then was bumped between NO DECAF and AMERICAN OF COURSE a couple strides later, and retired early. SEA ART vied early two wide,
faltered entering the turn, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
BRAVO ZULU set a clear pace along the rail, drew off around the far turn and held well clear under a drive. HATARI settled off the pace while racing two
wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, rallied outside and was up for the place late. STRONG EMBRACE saved ground off the pace, angled out
early on the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn but was one-paced through the lane. FISH MOONEY failed to menace while racing two
and three wide. VEXEDNRELAXED chased the pace three wide, angled to the rail entering the far turn and faded nearing the lane. UKIYO prompted the
winner two wide and tired around the far turn. SCIENCE FRICTION chased the pace inside and retreated around the far turn. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
