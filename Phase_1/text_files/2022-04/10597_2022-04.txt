victory. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS was bumped at the start and steadied, raced off the pace, advanced outside on the turn, came wide into the lane and rallied
for second. ONE PAIR OF HANDS bobbled at the break and was bumped, settled off the pace, moved up on the far turn and rallied mildly for third. DUNE
JUMPER broke outward bumping a rival, set the pace, opened up on the backside, dueled briefly with the winner on the far turn and tired. SOPHIA
LAUREN raced five wide early, then settled off the pace inside and did not factor. MELITZA stumbled at the start, raced six wide early, three wide on the
backside and did not factor. SOUL SEARCHER was bumped at the start, raced four wide early and was outrun.

three quarters then passed rivals while no threat. LONDONDERRY lacked speed then reduced the margin without menacing. ABHAILE angled to the inside
moving clear early then came up empty through the stretch. WEST HORIZEN saved ground and lacked a response. ANGEL RAPHAEL fanned wide on the
first turn, raced close up and stopped.

SMOKEY WHITE was bumped at the start, stalked the pacesetter, moved up on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, responded when roused, quickly took
charge and pulled away under urging. HOTPOT stalked outside, chased the leaders on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside and
was up late for the place spot. THAT'S RIGHT set the pace racing with a clear lead, was no match when challenged by SMOKEY WHITE, then dug in
through the lane and lost second. DEPLANE was steadied at the start, raced three wide off the pace, chased on the turn and had no rally. OLD BEAU was
bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. LEA'S ROAD tracked along the inside, chased on the turn and faded. SWEET PARI
was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and was outrun. ALIGNMENT was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

CAUSE I SAID raced off the pace, moved up two wide on the turn, rallied three wide between horses past the furlong marker, finished willingly and pulled
away under urging. SHESASUPERFREAK dueled two wide for the lead, continued to duel with SYSTEMIC RISK on the turn, dug in gamely in the two path
in the stretch drive and finished well to earn the place spot. SEAMIALAUGH stalked two wide, moved up three wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch
drive, closed late and got up for third. SYSTEMIC RISK dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run and weakened
late. MEMPHIS MAFIA raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and closed belatedly on the rail. SOLEMN OATH did not factor. MS CANELA broke in
a tangle, then ducked in sharply, hit the temporary rail and lost the rider, walked off. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.

HOORAY FOR HARVEY eased back in the opening quarter, bid outside on the turn then pulled away through the last eighth driving. HIZAAM sprinted to the
front inside, was collared in midstretch and continued gamely to the finish. CHARGIN STORM saved ground, loomed a threat into the stretch and flattened
out. YEI YEI chased in the two path, made a brief rally on the turn then faded. SIX CIDER saved ground throughout and lacked a rally. CLEAR
PROSPERITY lagged far behind and was never a factor. TONKA FLOWER lunged at the start, raced wide and was always outrun. IRONBOUND dropped
back early and weakened steadily. SHANDIAN flashed speed in the opening quarter mile then stopped abruptly.

led briefly at the eighth pole then was outfinished late. GO SKIPPY GO outrun early, advanced inside on the final turn and was up for the show. DADASHEV
very wide on the first turn, stalked wide and came up empty. SOCIAL JOE raced close up inside then began fading on the final turn. TOLEDO GOLD raced
within range early then weakened steadily. ORACABESSA chased wide and gave way readily. PREFONTAINE lagged far behind and was never a factor.
SLAM BANG lagged far behind and trailed throughout.
