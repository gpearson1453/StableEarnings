Footnotes
BROOKE MARIE rated outside the leader early, challenged around the turn, drifted out some crossing the dirt losing a bit of ground, fought back while
continuing to drifted out through the stretch and inched ahead late to prove best. ALICE MARBLE away quickly from inside, dueled with BROOKE MARIE
on the turn, carried a short lead over that rival while drifting out into deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. TOBYS HEART stalked a bit off the rail into the
turn, came three wide into the stretch, steered inside the at the top of the stretch, needed to find more in the final furlong but kept on to hold the show.
ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) pulled the rider along and tossed her head early, chased off the rail then swung out across the dirt and lacked a late bid.
TAPWATER steadied along the outer rail racing at the back early, gained through the turn from outside, entered the stretch five wide, lost the whip past the
sixteenth pole and flattened out. COVER VERSION got put in tight and had to steady between foes early, jumped the track crossing back onto the turn while
four wide and could not rally.

Footnotes
SMUGGLER'S RUN chased the top pair from off the rail, bid three deep around the bend, took over with a quarter mile left to run, kicked clear exiting the
turn, then drew away under right-handed urging and coasted in late. MOOSE MITCHELL dueled inside WHAT IN BLAZES up the backstretch, vied with
rivals while saving ground through the turn, could not keep pace with the winner into the stretch and stayed on to secure second. WHAT IN BLAZES
stumbled a bit leaving the gate, quickly recovered and went up to duel outside MOOSE MITCHELL for command, vied between rivals on the turn, lost touch
with the winner entering the stretch and weakened down the lane. MR. T'S THIRSTY settled along the inside, shifted three wide entering the stretch and
lacked further response. FINNEUS was off slow from outside then became rank early, settled at the back well off the rail, rounded the turn four wide and
weakened.

Footnotes
RAPID TRANSIT chased the leader into the first turn then angled outside that rival and went up to take command, cleared approaching the half-mile pole,
coaxed along the inside into the stretch, urged right-handed in the lane and held safely. A NEW PEACE chased two wide through both turns, moved out in
the lane and gained the place. TOO MUCH HEAVEN hop slightly and broke out, tugged the rider to the front and became rank into the first turn when rated,
lost command around the clubhouse turn, remained prominent from inside then chased the winner past half-mile pole, traveled two wide around the second
bend, could not summon the needed late kick in the furlong grounds and churned on for the show. BESTRELLA (IRE) threw her head and came away slow,
traveled three wide around the turns and needed to find more in the final furlong. BADGER KITTEN reserved in the early going in the two path outside a
rival, moved to the inside for the second bend, saved ground to the stretch and failed to threaten. DONUT GIRL was off slow to start, traveled along the rail
into the first turn then tipped to the two path around the bend, continued two wide into the stretch and made no impact. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) settled inside
early, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to menace. OPERATIC off slow and broke inward, trailed two wide around the first turn, entered the stretch
three wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DESERT DAWN stalked along the inside then steered off the rail on the first turn, closed in around the second bend and bid three deep past the quarter
pole, gained command in upper stretch, drifted inward while dueling with ADARE MANOR, corrected with the left-hand with a sixteenth left to run and
gamely prevailed. ADARE MANOR went three wide around the first turn while pressing the pace, challenged for command at the half-mile pole, fought with
AIN'T EASY through the far turn, dueled inside DESERT DAWN in the final furlong and finished gamely in defeat. AIN'T EASY set the pace under pressure
from ADARE MANOR, headed by that rival at the half-mile pole, dueled around the far turn, lost command at the top of the stretch and weakened to third.
UNDER THE STARS stumbled badly leaving the gate and brushed with rival shortly after, lagged behind early, passed a tiring MICROS SHARE while
saving ground through the far turn and never threatened. MICRO SHARE brushed with UNDER THE STARS in the beginning, went three wide around the
first turn, raced well off the pace up the backstretch, steered to the inside for the far turn, moved out around the bend and entered the stretch three wide,
had little left and was eased to the wire and walked off..

Footnotes
CAIRO MEMORIES bothered from inside at the start, sped clear to take control first time through the stretch, set the pace on the inside, kicked clear in
upper stretch and widened through the final furlong. STERLING CREST (IRE) broke out but was away quickest, ceded control to CAIRO MEMORIES first
time through the stretch, stalked that rival near the inside to the far turn, pushed upon late on the turn, could not make any headway on the winner in the
furlong grounds but bested the rest. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN stumbled at the start, steered to the inside racing at the back, asked around the far turn while
continuing to save ground and was along for the show. ELEUTHERA rated along the inside, moved off the rail but lacked room and had to steady on the first
turn, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, tipped three wide leaving the second bend and could not rally. LUCKY GIRL (IRE) got bothered from inside at
the start, pulled early while outside a rival, eased further while moving closer leaving the clubhouse turn, closest in pursuit two wide on the far turn, then
weakened in the stretch run. SIXTEEN ARCHES (IRE) traveled outside a rival at the back, went three then four wide on the far turn and could not rally.

TAIBA broke well from outside, had speed three deep or four wide into the first turn, let the top pair go and dropped into a stalking position around the bend,
chased three wide into the far turn, pressed upon around the bend and took aim two wide into the stretch, drew alongside the leader approaching the final
sixteenth and drove clear. MESSIER raced up close between rivals into the first turn then stalked the leader leaving the bend, bid from outside at the
three-eighths pole, took over approaching the quarter pole, put away FORBIDDEN KINGDOM leaving the turn and crossed to the inside, led clear into the
final furlong, challenged by TAIBA outside the sixteenth pole and yielded to that rival while clearly second best. HAPPY JACK broke a bit slow from inside,
traveled at the back up the backstretch, trailed along the inside into the stretch, ,summoned a mild rally and bested the rest. ARMAGNAC pulled early then
settled off the rail, moved to the inside for the second end, tipped off the rail late on the turn and could not rally. WIN THE DAY dropped back early, went
three then two wide around the first turn, steered outside a rival on the backstretch, rounded the far turn four wide and lacked further response.
FORBIDDEN KINGDOM sped to the front with rivals alongside into the first turn then took full control around the bend, pressured by MESSIER at the
three-eighths pole, lost command approaching the quarter pole, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
DUTCH BUS sent from inside to challenge from command, dueled into and around the turn, drifted out while battling down the lane, brushed SAWASDEE
near the wire and prevailed. SAWASDEE got bumped leaving the gate but was still away quickly, sped to the front then dueled outside a rival for command,
held a short lead through the turn, continued to battled while being floated out by DUTCH BUS, finished gamely and got brushed near the wire.
AGRIGENTO settled in mid-pack, rounded the turn five then four wide, put in mild late bid and gained the show. BAG'S GOLD bumped and stumbled
leaving the gate, got bumped again early and had the rider lose his iron briefly, chased inside to two wide on the turn, produced a mild rally and rounded out
the superfecta. CHRIS FIX broke slow then steadied between rivals early, raced along the rail then two wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and
kept on to improve placings. POSEIDON'S KID broke in and bumped rival, tracked between rivals early, went three to four wide into the lane and flattened
out. ARTHUR SPOONER chased outside rivals up the backstretch, four then three wide on the turn and weakened. ARICKAREE got bumped early and
dropped back, trailed two wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace. SPEED GRAZY got bumped and checked between rivals early,
came four wide into the stretch and could not summon a late rally. PHILOSOPHER'S TONE broke well, showed early speed then chased the top pair up the
backstretch, crept closer around the bend, took aim two wide into the stretch but faded through the lane. ROMEO'S GLORY bumped outside rival and
bobbled at the start, dropped back early, traveled four then five on the turn and made no impact. ECONOMICAL bumped both sides leaving the gate,
bumped again and checked soon after, raced in mid-pack along the rail on the turn and weakened. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED DUTCH BUS FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND FLOATING SAWASDEE OFF HIS PATH IN THE STRETCH,
COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

SCENIC MASTERPIECE broke slow, angled down to the inside and gained up the backstretch, waited behind leaders nearing the quarter pole, tipped to a
clear path, drew alongside SNARK in midstretch and drove clear late. SNARK prompted the pace from inside, dueled on the turn, took over midway around
the bend, cleared with a quarter mile left to run, collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole and yielded in the late stages. GRANOLA GIRL traveled in
range two wide into the turn, chased behind rivals then angled to the rail at the quarter pole, tipped out in the lane and finished willingly for the show. BANJO
QUEEN off slow to begin, chased in the two path into the turn, got boxed in between foes and behind a rival nearing the quarter pole, found a clear path two
wide entering the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane and kept on for a minor award. YADIAMA stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, traveled three
wide into the turn, shifted out at the quarter pole, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. MYGALSDAWNNLORI off slow in the beginning, lost
action crossing over surfaces, went two wide into the lane and failed to menace. ADELE DARLING dwelt at the start, coming away very slowly, traveled
along the rail into the turn, exited the bend two wide and was not a factor. SOUL OF A WARRIOR set the pace outside SNARK up the backstretch, fought
with that rival around the bend, lost touch with a quarter mile remaining and faded in the lane. LOOKINTOGETEVEN chased outside a rival, lost his action
at the seven-sixteenths pole and dropped back, came three wide into the lane and was not persevered with.

Footnotes
BURNIN TURF forwardly placed then got put in tight quarters early, went five deep into the turn, moved in some and came four wide into the stretch, rallied
from outside and proved best in the late. GREGDAR forwardly placed four deep into the turn, bid outside the leader approaching the dirt, vied between in
the lane and got outkicked by the winner. ARKAAN showed the way down the hill, challenged approaching the dirt, resisted to deep stretch and yielded late.
HARBORED MEMORIES bumped with rival early, chased the pace outside foes, angled in entering the turn, tipped out and came three wide into the
stretch, bid between rivals in the lane but lacked the needed late punch. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) tracked along the inside down the hill, lacked room in
midstretch and was ridden out to the wire. ANACONDA bumped between rivals early, floated out by inner rival crossing the dirt and kept on to improve
position. STRIKE THAT got bumped early, put in tight and checked into the turn, went two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. HUDSON RIDGE was
off slow from outside, took a bump early and got put in tight, was crowded between entering the turn, lacked room late on the turn, gained a clear path and
could not rally. ENCODER raced outside a rival at the back, went three wide into the turn, came out crossing the dirt and made no impact. COULTHARD
(IRE) unhurried from inside, traveled two wide then came out crossing the dirt and made no impact. COAST OF ROAN saved ground from off the pace and
failed to menace.

Footnotes
HALFBARBERBINGIE dropped back early, angled in on the first turn, took closer order in the middle stages, angled four wide into the stretch, reached the
front approaching the sixteenth pole and won going away. HULK vied inside a pair of rivals into the first turn, cleared around the bend, took some pressure
on the backstretch before inching clear once more, drew away in upper stretch but was run down by the winner nearing the sixteenth marker and had to
settle for second best. GOT CURLY vied three deep into the first turn, chased the leader into the backstretch, moved up to apply pressure again on the
backstretch, lost touch at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased three wide into the drive and held the show. CANDY FOR CARMEL vied between foes early
then ceded the lead and angled in, stalked from inside up the backstretch, saved ground to the stretch and churned on to secure a minor award. TODAY
MATTERS checked between foes early, went four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, moved closer four deep into the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch and needed to find more in the furlong grounds. LOOKOUT POINT unhurried in the beginning and steered to the inside, tipped two wide on the
far turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to threaten. TUCKER'S TRIBUTE traveled two to three wide and sat well off the pace, entered the lane two wide
and never threatened. BROTHERLY LOVE chased inside into the first turn, tipped off the rail around the bend, went three then four wide on the far turn and
flattened out. ITS BIG chased in the two path then angled to the inside on the clubhouse turn, saved ground off the pace to the stretch and never made an
impact. WEEGEE traveled five wide into the first turn then moved in a bit around the bend, remained wide to the stretch and came up empty. MONGOLIAN
NINJA checked between rivals early, crept closer off the rail up the backstretch, got shuffled between runners into the far turn, drifted five wide around that
bend and tired. ASPHALT ANDY was off a bit slow to begin, was rank when trying to be rated well off the pace, trailed into the lane and was never a factor.
