FLYER'S SHADOW made the pace on a short lead inside rivals, shook off a bid into the lane and held safe through the lane. JUST LUCK tracked the
leaders about two wide, angled out into the lane to have aim at the winner but could not run that one down. SMILIN JOSIE saved ground throughout and
rallied to just gain the show late. BEAUTIFUL JUDGE prompted the pace three wide outside the winner and lacked a final closing bid. RUN BRINLEE RUN
was with the early pace three or four wide and weakened.

TAKE CHARGE PATTI made the pace on a short lead off the rail while inside POW POW, edged clear in the far turn and drew off under urging then was
gearing down nearing the wire. POW POW prompted the pace outside the winner to the far turn and could not match strides nearing the lane.
COUVERTURE angled in going to the far turn and could not threaten in the lane. HEAVENS PRINCESS moved up three and four wide while not a threat.
HANNAH'S STORM was angled out in the first turn nearest the top pair and weakened. GIROLAMO LUCY was not a factor. TICKER had her rider lose his
irons at the break and steadily dropped back.

collar the leader in deep stretch. G KATE was on the pace inside a rival to kick clear into the far turn, widened nearing the lane then could not hold the
winner sae late. NEW YEARS LOVE was crowded between rivals as a rival came out into the first turn, moved back in going up the backstretch and

forced out into the first turn outside rivals, followed the pace four wide and lacked a rally. D'WILD MUFFIN prompted the pace three wide outside G KATE
and weakened nearing the lane. HIGH COST OF LIVIN came out into the first turn to put rivals in tight, continued outside and dropped back while six wide

THAT'S ALL RIGHT tucked inside going to the first turn to save ground behind the lead group, rallied to challenge into the far turn and edged clear then
drew off in the lane under steady handling. DISTINCT APPROVAL was on the pace out from the rail to the far turn then could not go with the winner nearing
the lane. JUST SPLENDID saved ground and moved up through the far turn then slowly closed to miss the place late. SKYKAT moved up outside, came
five wide into the lane and came up short for the minor honors. INDAWIN moved up three wide but could not threaten late. BODIE ON POINTE was
between foes in the first turn and weakened going to the far turn. UNTETHERED SOUL checked inside rivals entering the first turn, was angled out and
weakened. MISS ORATORY was always back. SOYBEAN tired four wide.
