Footnotes
PRINCESS CORA reared up and lost her rider prior to the start of the race, was bumped and squeezed back slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase
the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the two path around the turn, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch and pulled clear with
a furlong to go. HOOSIER GOLD CASE trailed the field from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and
gained ground quickly on the outside late to just get up for the place. I LOVE TO RACE brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, settled off the
pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the turn, could not go with the winner and finished evenly,
getting caught for the place in the final jumps. COOKIN ROSES brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, dueled on the outside up the
backstretch, took over the lead from the two path while racing around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened late.
NOFANSINTHESTANDS raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, improved position mildly while racing in the three path around the
turn and flattened out in the final furlong. AVASARALA dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while
racing in the two path around the turn, and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
TEE BURNS dueled outside of PRAIRIE WOLF early, was keen to take a clear lead past the half, set the pace while saving ground along the turn, was
pushed along in upper stretch and briefly driven midstretch, and maintained a decisive advantage to the wire. RACARINO chased inside of WELLER
ROGUE early, began to rally well up the rail near the three eighths, continued to improve position along the fence in upper stretch, and proved second best.
PRAIRIE WOLF broke inward and bumped IRONMAN RICHIE in the opening strides, dueled inside of TEE BURNS until just past the half, tracked the pace
in the two to three path on the turn, swung into the lane in the five path, and chased on mildly. OFF TO THE BEACH settled at the rear, raced three wide
with the rear group around the turn, swung out to the five to six path in upper stretch, and kept on to pass tiring horses. IRONMAN RICHIE was pinballed
between horses in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, was pushed along in the three path on the turn, swung into the lane in
the six path and went to a drive, drifted out midstretch and came up empty. WELLER ROGUE broke out and bumped IRONMAN RICHIE in the opening
strides, chased outside of RACARINO down the back straight, raced two wide between horses toward the rear around the bend, was driven in the three
path in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MOMENT brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, held a short lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch,
continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn, turned back a challenger in upper stretch and pulled clear. ONE WAY HOME pressed
the pace from the two path through the opening half mile, continued to contest on the outside around the far turn, could not go with the winner in upper
stretch and chased that rival home, holding second. TRY TRY AGAIN raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two and three path, and improved position mildly down the lane while proving to be no
match for the winner. BULLDOG OF BERGEN raced off the pace in the two path around the first turn, continued around the far turn still in the two path and
was outkicked in the stretch. IRISH MAJOR brushed with the horse to his inside and was shuffled back leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground
around the first turn and up the backstretch, made up some ground from the rail while racing around the far turn and was never a threat. THE LAST
OPTION raced in the two and three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn
from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and tired from there.

Footnotes
GOLDEN LANCE broke out, was placed on the lead, was confronted by PO BOY past the seven sixteenths but continued to set the pace in the two path,
opened up when driven in upper stretch and stayed on. PO BOY broke slightly awkwardly and outward, was pushed between for early position, tracked the
early pace two wide, bid outside of GOLDEN LANCE into the turn, proved no match from upper stretch, chased the pacesetter under a drive, and found just
enough to hold place between horses. SMOKEY SONG settled four wide in the rear flight early, settled in a clear last approaching the half mile mark, raced
in the two path on the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, found his best stride in the final sixteenth, rallied, and missed the place. BLOOMING GARDEN
tracked inside, was pushed along while saving ground around the turn, went to a drive inside in upper stretch, chased on but was outfinished for the place.
SMART TRIAL was reluctant to load, got herded out in the opening strides when GOLDEN LANCE broke outward, raced five wide toward the rear early,
was pushed along into the turn, offered a four wide bid, was driven five wide in upper stretch, but could not sustain his rally. MINISTRY OF ART was grazed
by PO BOY in the opening strides, chased three wide early, settled toward the rear approaching the half, chased in the two to three path around the turn,
came into the lane three wide, and offered no rally.

Footnotes
GUACO raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, began to move up while racing in the three path around the turn, raced in tight
quarters and brushed lightly with FLEETWAY near the three sixteenths pole, and wore down his rivals while drifting out in late stretch. WILD FOX raced
inside at the back of the pack in the early going, saved ground around the turn, swung out to launch a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground
outside while chasing the winner home. GOLDENPENCE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle in
upper stretch and was caught late while finishing evenly. FLEETWAY chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path, drifted out mildly and brushed with GUACO at the three sixteenths pole, and was outkicked from there while finishing evenly between horses.
PITAMAN dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn and into upper stretch, and flattened
out in the final sixteenth of a mile. DEMAND RANSOM raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three
and four path and faded entering the stretch.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S BIG WIN was fractious in the gate, attended the early pace outside of OMAHA RED and COURTHOUSE COVE, pressed the pace in the three
path on the turn, was driven three wide with the leading flight in upper stretch, was bumped midstretch by COURTHOUSE COVE as a result of OMAHA
RED coming out, kept on nonetheless, dueled outside of OMAHA RED through the final sixteenth and narrowly outfinished that foe. OMAHA RED broke
sharply, raced at the inside of the leading flight early, settled back to track the leading pair from near the seven sixteenths, saved ground around the turn,
was urged up the inside to reengage the leading flight in upper stretch, came out and bumped COURTHOUSE COVE midstretch, kept on under a drive
inside, dueled inside of GHAALEB'S BIG WIN through the final sixteenth but was just outfinished. COURTHOUSE COVE broke sharply, vied between
horses early, led narrowly around the turn while taking pressure from GHAALEB'S BIG WIN outside, raced into the lane in the leading flight, was bumped
midstretch when OMAHA RED came out, vied to the sixteenth but was no match late. PATH TO SUCCESS chased inside, came out and bumped VALLEY
VISTA near the seven sixteenths, chased in the two path on the turn, was driven in the two path in upper stretch, and kept on best of the rest. DUST
DANCER tracked the leading line down the backstretch, continued to chase the leading trio in the three path on the turn while between horses, was driven
four wide into the lane, and lacked the needed kick between horses. BOAT SONG was bumped soundly in the opening strides by VALLEY VISTA, raced
keenly with the rear of the main field early, bid four wide into the turn, was continued in range approaching the quarter, was driven six wide into the lane and
flattened. ALEXIS N NIKO chased outside of PATH TO SUCCESS early, checked after being bumped near the seven sixteenths, raced at the rear of the
main pack in the four path on the turn, was driven five wide in upper stretch, drifted in and had no rally. VALLEY VISTA broke outward and bumped BOAT
SONG in the opening strides, settled near the rear, was bumped by PATH TO SUCCESS near the seven sixteenths and bumped into ALEXIS N NIKO as a
result, chased toward the rear of the main group in the three path around the bend, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, and lacked a bid. SPALDING
STROLL was awkward into stride, lost touch with the field, and always trailed.

Footnotes
SHEZ RECKLESS was hustled to an early lead up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path around the turn, dueled in upper stretch
and put away her rivals to pull clear in the final furlong. STORMY EMPIRE tracked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch and could not go with the winner late, chasing that rival to the
wire. LONG TALL WOMAN chased the leader between horses in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, was outkicked with a furlong to go
and held third while drifting in late stretch. STACY ATTACK settled off the pace behind horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
two path, and made a mild improvement of position down the lane while never threatening. RANK AND FILE stalked the leader on the outside in the
opening stages, raced three wide around the turn and was no match for the top finishers from there. PERFECT DIVA trailed the field the entire way around
the oval, raced in the three path around the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
FAMA Y DINERO broke outward, tracked inside of COAL TOWN ROAD, encroached inside of that leader into the turn, dueled inside of COAL TOWN
ROAD from the seven sixteenths to past the five sixteenths, took the lead into the lane, began to drift out in upper stretch, kept on, dueled with HIGH BROW
through the final furlong and got the nod. HIGH BROW hesitated slightly at the start, was shut off between FAMA Y DINERO and KAN IT HAPPEN in the
opening strides, chased inside early, was pushed along past the seven sixteenths and began to improve in the two path, went to a drive in upper stretch,
altered inward as FAMA Y DINERO drifted out in front of him, engaged inside of FAMA Y DINERO near the furlong mark, dueled inside of that foe under a
drive and missed. KANITHAPPEN was herded inward by COAL TOWN ROAD in the opening strides, chased between horses, was pushed along in traffic
into the turn, chased two wide around the bend, was driven into the lane two wide, and chased on best of the rest. COAL TOWN ROAD broke inward,
nonetheless soon led, was engaged by FAMA Y DINERO to his inside into the turn, dueled two wide from the seven sixteenths to past the five sixteenths,
proved no match nearing the quarter, raced three wide into the lane, and chased on only mildly. EL ROMANTICO was wrangled to the rear early, saved
ground around the turn, rallied inside in upper stretch, and flattened out late. KING ZION tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and into the turn,
was driven three wide around the bend, came four wide into the lane, and weakened while drifting out. TEA AFTER BALLET chased three deep down the
backstretch, continued near the rear three wide on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, and failed to rally while drifting out. SWEET LITTLE RUE chased
four deep down the backstretch, continued in the four to five path around the turn, swung six wide into the lane and flattened.
