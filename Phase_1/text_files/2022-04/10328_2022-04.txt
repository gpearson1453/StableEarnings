Footnotes
BENEFACTOR grabbed the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch then took on the challenge from
FARLEY mid-way around the far turn, dueled gamely from the inside, got headed by rival a furlong out, battled back, took back a slight edge and refused to
be denied. FARLEY was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge BENEFACTOR midway
around the far turn, dueled outside of rival into the lane, poked a head in front a furlong out, lost the edge in deep stretch and failed to get back by. PAPA
HONOR tugged while rated between foes near midpack, launched a three wide bid leaving the far turn, sustained steady response in the lane and secured
a share. PARLOR angled inside shortly after the start and settled in the back three wide, prompted two wide entering the upper stretch and had a mild
improve. POCO CHARLIE settled outside through early stages, prompted four wide mid-way around the far turn, showed interest then failed to move on in
the lane. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER tracked the pace up the backstretch, prompted inside through the far turn then gave way in the lane. BUFFALO MAX
settled and saved ground through early stages, shifted out approaching the upper stretch and lacked a rally. MYSTERY BANK raced in range up the
backstretch, prompted three to four wide through the final turn then came up empty turning for home.

Footnotes
GHOSTLINER stalked the pace from the rail, waited for room from nearing the quarter pole to midstretch, came through inside of the pacesetter near the
eighth pole, took the lead near the sixteenth marker and just lasted. GRAINGER COUNTY hit the starting gate, chased the pace four wide around the turn,
closed outside and just missed. HENRY'S WORLD sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, drifted slightly in upper stretch, led past the eighth pole and
held well enough to preserve the show. MAI TY ONE ON bumped with BEE BY THE SEA soon after the start, raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in
upper stretch and rallied between foes. HANDSOME PRINCE was off a bit slowly, saved ground well back and rallied along the rail. FAMOUS GENT raced
off the pace three wide, shifted five wide nearing the quarter pole and had a mild stretch gain. MILITARY DRILL dueled two wide to midstretch and
weakened. TRINNI SUMMER broke a bit awkwardly, saved ground and never threatened. RICHY saved ground off the pace, swung four wide near the
quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. BALISTICO pressed the pace three wide between foes and tired in the drive. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES prompted the
pace four wide and faded in upper stretch. BEE BY THE SEA was bumped soon after the start, raced tow wide and played no further factor. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

FAMILY WAY was unhurried to the third and final turn, swung four wide getting roused approaching the top of the stretch, kicked in nicely and swept past
the leaders from outside leaving the furlong grounds. HARAJUKU (IRE) hugged the rail throughout while within range, rallied willingly on the fence and was
up for the place. BEAUTIFUL LOVER advanced three wide to loom a threat on the final turn, bid between horses through midstretch but was outfinished.
SISTER OTOOLE steadied in traffic entering the first turn, continued along saving ground on the ensuing bends, moved out for the drive and gained mildly
outside. SCARABEA steadied in traffic entering the first turn, moved out four wide right after that and went up to take over the lead, moved in showing the
way to the stretch the final time, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. CHAMPAGNE IVY led early inside, conceded the front to SCARABEA
coming off the initial turn and moved out to prompt the pace from outside, stayed on to upper stretch and weakened. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
QUALITY G secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the pacesetter up the backstretch, waited patiently around the far turn, tipped out three
wide and given cue near the furlong marker, responded and edged away in deep stretch. HALL OF DREAMS tracked the pace three wide through early
stages, advanced to threaten MY ROMEO LIMA for the lead late on the far turn, continued in striking distance into the final furlong, could not move on with
the winner in deep stretch but sustained bid and captured place. MY ROMEO LIMA led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and
held a slim lead around the far turn, fought back over threatening HALL OF DREAMS in the lane, continued to hold a slight edge then yielded in deep
stretch. BRAILLE settled three to four wide through early stages, was ridden along three wide a furlong out and lacked a rally. REFUAH was off a step slow
at the start, rated inside off the early pace, came under a ride along the inside at the head of the lane and failed to move on. BANDIMERE stalked the pace
up the backstretch, was ridden along two wide through the far turn then weakened in the lane. WALTHAM WARRIOR raced two wide between foes in the
last flight and had no response when called upon. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

missed second. SOSUA SUMMER pressed the winner two wide to midstretch and weakened. WICKED FAST bumped with RED DANGER at the start,
raced off the pace two wide and never threatened. MANNIX (IRE) hit the starting gate, saved ground off the early pace, rushed up three wide between foes

FEARLESS was never far back, wrested command outside COMMANDEER coming to the five-sixteenths going comfortably, and widened through the
stretch hand urged. CAPOCOSTELLO received a light bump from GREATEST HONOUR at the start, lagged well out of it for six furlongs, came four wide
finding stride at the top of the lane, and was up for the place. GREATEST HONOUR lunged at the break and came down bumping CAPOCOSTELLO lightly,
raced four wide early, was asked to go after the leaders entering the far turn four then three wide, moved into second leaving the eighth-pole, then was
overhauled for that position nearing the wire. TWELVE VOLT MAN was three wide early, stayed in range for six furlongs, and tired. COMMANDEER led into
the first turn before yielding to CARLOS L., rebid for the lead into the far turn, proved no match for FEARLESS approaching the stretch, and faltered through
the drive. CARLOS L. tugged his way through between horses to get the lead midway on the first turn, moved in setting the pace up the backstretch,
stopped abruptly into the far turn, was pulled up and walked off.

CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced two wide into the first turn, settled nicely while rated off the early pace, began to pick
up the tempo late on the far turn, swung four wide into the upper stretch, took over the lead a furlong out, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task
under steady pressure. STOLEN HOLIDAY stalked inside up the backstretch, waited patiently around the far turn then bumped with DESIGNED BY KITTEN
at the head of the lane, raced in traffic at the furlong marker then got clear two wide and produced a solid finish. STUNNING PRINCESS secured inside
position around the first turn and settled off the early pace, raced two wide going by the quarter pole, shifted out wider for a clear path at the head of the
lane, sustained steady response and gained show. GRAND AVE GIRL dictated the pace by a narrow margin on the first turn and set the pace up the
backstretch, held on to a slim lead around the far turn, fought back in the upper stretch then got collared by the winner near the furlong marker and gave
way. SUGAR FIX raced in range up the backstretch, advanced to loom a threat three wide at the quarter pole, stayed on two to three wide into the upper
stretch then flattened out. IL MALOCCHIO raced near midpack, prompted two to three wide around the far turn, shifted wider for the drive and lacked a rally.
DESIGNED BY KITTEN was forwardly placed around the first turn, continued to track in close range up the backstretch, raced in aim two wide at the quarter
pole, began to flatten then bumped with rival at the head of the lane and weakened. TRAFFIC SONG tugged while taken back in opening stages, saved
ground throughout and failed to move on when called upon. RUN UP UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
WISH YOU WELL set the pace in the two path, drew clear rounding the turn and dug in to repel a late challenge. INVENTING stumbled at the start,
advanced inside around the turn, angled three wide nearing the head of the lane, had aim outside of the winner through the lane and was inching closer.
FRIPPET chased the pace three wide, could not threaten the top but outfinished a foe for the show. INVITING saved ground in midpack, improved position
in upper stretch but lacked a closing bid. EASY TO LOVE broke inwardly and bumped HOLY MINISTER into SINGALONG KAYLA at the start, raced four
wide and was no threat. TACHLIS prompted the winner in the three path and was through after a half. STARSHIP BABE was outrun while racing two wide.
SINGALONG KAYLA was bumped at the start, had early speed four wide and was through early. FRIEDA broke awkwardly, raced greenly early, went four
wide around the turn and made little impact. HOLY MINISTER was bumped between foes at the start and never involved.

Footnotes
GUFO saved ground unhurried for a mile, shifted out four wide getting his cue coming to the quarter-pole, responded readily while shaken up a bit through
upper stretch, overpowered ABAAN from outside and drew away hand urged. ABAAN stayed close early, ranged up three wide to take over turning for
home, pulled clear with a furlong remaining but was no match for the winner late. NOVO SOL (BRZ) took closer order inside through the middle stages,
shifted to the three-path with a mild bid coming off the final turn, then flattened out. TEMPLE went along in the second slight two wide for a mile, moved out
three to four wide approaching the stretch, but could not sustain the rally. BAKERS BAY was never prominent. MID DAY IMAGE was reserved tracking
TIDE OF THE SEA early, reached a short lead after a mile, but had nothing left soon after that. TIDE OF THE SEA set the early pace, gave way on the final
turn, and jogged in. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
WEYBURN rated midpack near the inside through early stages, was ridden along the outside around the turn, roused forward to challenge for the lead in the
upper stretch, dug in four deep a furlong out and kicked clear. COLLABORATE tracked up close through early stages, moved up three wide to press the
issue while being roused near upper stretch, failed to move on with the winner past the furlong marker but sustained solid response and edged a rival for
place. FORTIN HILL chased inside in close range, was ridden along the rail around the turn, briefly came out a path at the head of the lane, shifted back to
the inside, raced in striking distance a furlong out, could not kick on for the win but kept on with response and gained show. QUICK TEMPO was ridden
along two wide out of the gate and took a slim lead after initial stages, set the pace inside and held firm around the turn, fought back under attack from trio in
the upper stretch, got collared past the furlong marker and gave way. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK chased two wide in contention into the turn, flattened out near
the quarter pole then came four to five wide into the upper stretch and offered no late rally. SHIVAREE raced off the early speed, swung five wide into the
upper stretch and failed to rally. ROUGH ENTRY raced in the back in early stages, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
WHERE PARADISE LAY raced off the pace under steady urging, came three wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
MY PHILLY TWIRL bumped with ABITIEUSE at the start, pressed the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, edged ahead in midstretch then dug
in to fend off two late challengers. BIG TENTATIONS tracked the pace two wide around both turns, tipped three wide in upper stretch, steadily gained
outside of the winner and finished gamely between rivals to just miss. BEECHNUT TROPHY settled off the pace along the inside, waited for room while
racing two wide around the far turn, angled four wide near the eighth pole, kicked in outside and just missed. MISCHIEVOUS KISS was in range inside,
tipped two wide in upper stretch, made some progress then lacked a path through the final sixteenth. SENSITIVITY broke a bit awkwardly, sped to the front,
set a pressured pace inside, fought inside of the winner to midstretch then gave way. SHAD NATION was in tight early, trailed inside to upper stretch, tipped
out and had a mild belated gain. AMBITIEUSE bumped with the winner at the start then steadied soon after, raced off the pace two and three wide and
never threatened. HAIL TO steadied early, saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and played no factor. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KATHLEEN O. broke a half-step slow, negotiated the first turn four wide while allowed to settle into stride, remained well out in the track up the backstretch,
began moving still four wide into the far turn, challenged outside GODDESS OF FIRE as they left the rest behind after six furlongs, gained the upper hand
after straightening away for the drive and pulled away under only mild late urging. GODDESS OF FIRE moved out four wide approaching the backstretch,
advanced through the middle stages, took over four then three wide midway on the far turn, battled inside KATHLEEN O. into the stretch, and proved no
match while much best of the others. RUNNING LEGACY moved inside early, stayed on the rail for the drive and did enough to wind up a distant third.
AMANI'S IMAGE stayed in range early two wide, checked while being out-moved leaving the half-mile marker, shifted out to the four-path approaching the
stretch, and had nothing more. BLUSTERY raced four then three wide early, and was finished after six furlongs. CANCEL THIS set the early pace inside,
and faltered before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
PHANTOM CURRENCY sped to the lead soon after the start and angled inside, showed the way up the backstretch, held clear racing through the far turn,
given cue two wide at the head of the lane, responded gamely, dug in determinedly and prevailed under a driving finish. WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST was
forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked along the rail, picked up the pace mid-way around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, dug in
determinedly along the rail, raced in striking distance but could not get by the game winner. CARPENTERS CALL was forwardly placed racing just off the
pacesetter into the backstretch, commenced a steady bid around the far turn, stayed on three wide in close range through the stretch run and secured a
share. GRAY'S FABLE tugged a bit while rated near midpack up the backstretch, continued patiently handled two wide around the far turn, shifted out four
to five wide and given cue in upper stretch, gathered some ground in closing stages and gained position. ENGLISH BEE was well placed tracking the early
pace, prompted three wide at the quarter pole, ran on three to four wide into the lane and needed more to impact the front runners. NOBLE INDY was
unhurried and saved ground, angled out around the far turn, came five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. ORDER AND LAW was allowed to settle
through early stages, chased two wide around the far turn and failed to move into contention. SCARLETT SKY raced wide into the backstretch near the
back, edged a bit closer along the far outside then bolted around the far turn, remained in the body of the race and finished on the outside fence. RACE
WAS HAND TIMED, RUN UP UNAVAILABLE, FRACTIONS ADDED AND TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
WHITE ABARRIO settled off the early pace four wide, tucked in three wide early on the first turn, remained in touch outside down the backstretch, advanced
four wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the eighth pole and angled into two path, drove clear soon after, drifted out slightly leaving the
sixteenth pole and held safe. CHARGE IT hit the starting gate, angled into the two path to track the pace around the first turn, remained in range two wide
down the backstretch and around most of the far turn, angled four wide near the quarter pole, lugged in under right-handed urging in upper stretch then
again near the sixteenth pole, angled back outside of the winner leaving the sixteenth marker, switched back to the left lead and inched closer while still
appearing to try to lug in under hand urging. SIMPLIFICATION pressed the pace two wide between rivals, took the lead nearing the half-mile pole, dueled
inside of PAPPACAP in the two path around the far turn, vied inside of that rival and the winner through midstretch, could not keep pace with the winner
from there but stayed on willingly to hold third. PAPPACAP stalked the pace three wide, bid outside of SIMPLIFICATION nearing the far turn, dueled outside
of that foe in the three path around the far turn, turned for home on even terms between foes, could not quite match strides, angled out leaving the eighth as
the winner angled in and weakened. O CAPTAIN raced off the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, shifted out in upper
stretch and passed some tiring rivals. STEAL SUNSHINE raced well back while two wide around both turns, angled out in upper stretch and improved
position. . STRIKE HARD lacked early speed while saving ground around the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. CAJUN'S
MAGIC failed to menace while racing two and three wide. KING OF TRUTH broke a bit awkwardly and was outrun inside. CLAPTON raced four wide in
midpack, angled in nearing the lane and came up empty. CLASSIC CAUSEWAY set the pace along the rail, gave way readily nearing the far turn and was
not persevered with.
