along for third the final strides. FAST LOADED stalked off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced two deep on the far turn, then flattened the

REVEIRS MINUTE settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and
edged clear later yards. PETTYFORURTHOUGHTS rated a slim lead inside, dug in to the challenge of Sister Joann leaving the seven sixteenths pole, put
that one away into the far turn but picked up the winner leaving the turn and succumbed to that one mid-stretch. CHARITABLE MISS entered the first turn
about the four path then angled to the inside and settled off the pace, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and came along
for third mid-stretch. SISTER JOANN exchanged light contact with La Cubana leaving the gate then stalked from the two and three paths, challenged
approaching the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn. CHOPRA entered the first turn in the five path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little more. STONES ROAD rated close to the early
pace inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then faded at the rail on the far turn. SISTER SECRET LEE raced off the pace in the three and
four paths the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch. LA CUBANA exchanged light contact with Sister Joann
leaving the gate and settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then faded into the far turn.
