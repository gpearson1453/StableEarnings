COPPER BEECH was bumped in the first turn, settled down the backside in a good stalking position, rallied in the stretch and drew off under mild urging.
DANZA MAGIC was bumped in the first turn, had good position throughout, could not gain late on the winner but was second best. LAYITONTHICK bore
out in the first turn to avoid a piece of paper bumping with COPPER BEECH and DANZA MAGIC, set the pace until the top of the stretch and gradually
weakened. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ never far back early, saved ground and was no threat. STATE OF GRACE never far back early, lacked a late response.
LADY FORTUNE raced wide early and tired on the far turn. The rider of DANZA MAGIC claimed foul against the rider of COOPER BEECH for interference
in the first turn. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.

FOREST CHATTER dueled early, shook clear on the turn, widened late under steady urging. SALT MINE was unhurried early, rallied in the stretch, split
horses, finished swell and was up for place. LOCK ON contended throughout and finished evenly late. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL allowed to settle, failed to
menace. YO BERBS raced mid pack and had no rally. OX TROT flashed brief foot, and was through early. JOHNNY U dueled early and tired in the stretch.
