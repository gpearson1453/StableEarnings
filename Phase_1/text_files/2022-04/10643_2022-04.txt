Footnotes
G CITY WARRIOR broke on top, was rated on the front end from inside, let out some to shed LONG LEGGED LINDA leaving the turn, widened command
when asked upper stretch then continued to open up while ridden out the last eighth. SKYVALUE settled briefly, advanced four wide on the bend, angled in
some upper stretch and took over second nearing the final sixteenth. HIDDEN FIGURE prominent early, failed to keep up three wide on the turn, angled
outside SKYVALUE upper stretch, was closing the gap on the latter late and gained third. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN chased from between horses, angled to
the rail with two furlongs to go, had a striking position with an eighth left but leveled off instead. LONG LEGGED LINDA pressed G CITY WARRIOR from
just outside for nearly three furlongs then began to slowly yield. MISS LEARJET raced in contention from inside on the backstretch then gave way.

Footnotes
SUPER SILVER shared the early lead in hand outside CAMPAIGN SPY, moved clear when allowed on the second turn then proved much the best with little
encouragement. CAMPAIGN SPY set a pressured pace from inside, did not stay with SUPER SILVER after a half mile but was easily second best. LEMON
BLITZ gradually progressed, took the second bend three wide and gained third late from outside rivals. JOEY B raced in contention for six furlongs then
began to wear down between horses for the drive. DOLLAR BLUE prominent early, faded from inside on the second turn. TOCCETIVE JAC soon trailed,
ran up upon the failing TRUSTWORTHY, was checked solidly, unbalancing his rider briefly and never recovered. TRUSTWORTHY soon began to retreat
from inside, bobbled and lost his rider near the half mile marker and had to be humanely euthanized. There was a stewards' inquiry into TRUSTWORTHY'S
and TOCCETIVE JAC'S loss of action on the backstretch. After their review, no change was made.

Footnotes
LINE OF DENHAMS was kept close, commenced his bid three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the drive and gradually moved clear under a drive the
final eighth. W W RUSSIAN GOLD saved ground taking the turn, rallied the last furlong, split rivals two wide deep stretch and got up for second. STOSH
forwardly placed from outside, lost ground fanning five wide entering the lane and found best stride too late. KAY'S GRAY contested the pace outside
RAHFEE TOWN for four furlongs, could not hold back LINE OF DENHAMS and began to weaken in the waning yards. ZARMAE lost ground fanning widest
entering the stretch, made a strong move the final furlong but was too late. RAHFEE TOWN displayed early speed from inside but wore down the last
eighth. IT'S BELLAMY TIME prominent early, angled out taking the bend and gave way for the drive. CROWNED LEADER failed to menace.

LONESOME DREAM stalked the early speed, swiftly took over from outside on the bend then gradually lengthened command under hand urging the last
eighth. MON AMI FUZZIE broke well but soon dropped back from inside, picked up his pace in the lane, altered out with a sixteenth to go and split rivals
four wide in the waning yards to get up for second at the wire. RODEO MAN vied for the early lead outside CYCLONE ATTACK, did not stay with
LONESOME DREAM on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, fought for second deep stretch but was outfinished. CYCLONE ATTACK was hustled along
to contest the early pace, gained the rail on the bend, edged ahead for second upper stretch but did not have enough left in the late going. MAC
PANDOWDY improved position while widest taking the turn and was closing in on the second flight deep stretch. SAFE failed to menace.

Footnotes
DR. LIECHTY kept close between foes, swung out five wide for a clear path into the lane, gradually lugged in as he went for the lead and shook off
PEACOCK MAN nearing the wire. PEACOCK MAN contested the pace two wide between foes, did not keep up on the bend, came again under urging into
the lane, angled in some when DR. LIECHTY came close inside the last eighth, began to yield inside the final sixteenth but was clearly second best. BEL
BIMBO chased from outside, lost considerable ground fanning to the middle of the track for the stretch run, showed late interest and gained third in the
waning yards. ROAD GAME vied for the lead from inside, did not keep up on the bend, angled out five wide upper stretch and had no late bid. VIRGA was a
brief contender but faded two wide on the turn. STRATE REMARK disputed the pace between foes, took the bend three wide then flattened out for the
drive. RADIANT CASTLE chased from outside then could only improve position some between horses without threatening. R H SMOAKEM displayed early
speed from outside, was four wide taking the turn then gave way in the lane. DANG IT CASSIE showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI POINT shared the early lead just outside DARK NINJA, moved clear when asked upper stretch, was all out the final furlong and held off
TETSU. The latter raced in contention from outside on the backstretch, angled in some on the bend, commenced his bid nearing the end of three furlongs,
rallied from path three under hand urging in the stretch, narrowly missed but proved easily second best. TETSU'S rider returned after the race without his
whip. LITTLE MIGHTY MAN prominent outside SHANGHAI POINT, went for the lead on the turn, floated out some entering the lane and gradually yielded.
TAP'S BIG SHOT chased from inside, fanned out behind TETSU for the drive and showed late interest from between horses. DARK NINJA displayed early
speed from inside but began to yield before finishing three furlongs. OMAR ATTACK bobbled at the break and was never a factor. RIDE INTO THE SKY
reared up when the gate opened and was always outrun in a wide trip. There was a stewards' inquiry into RIDE INTO THE SKY'S start. After their review, it
was determined that RIDE INTO THE SKY was prepared to race with the rest of the field when the gate opened but reared up first.

Footnotes
TROUBLE FINDS ME pressed the early pace from just outside, took over when asked on the turn, responded to urging in the lane to draw off and was kept
to task to the wire. AROSE FOR LYLA well back early, was in path three taking the bend, angled out five wide for a clear path upper stretch, drifted out
under left-handed pressure inside the eighth pole then gradually lugged in when switched right-handed urging as she moved clear for second inside the final
sixteenth. CESSO displayed early speed from inside, was no match for TROUBLE FINDS ME when set down for the drive and began to wear down deep
stretch. PECOS AUTUMN helped prompt the pace from outside on the backstretch, floated out to path four entering the stretch then flattened out.
BETWEEN failed to menace in a wide trip. SHE TAKES FLIGHT in contention on the backstretch began to yield just off the inside leaving the bend. THINK
BLUE bobbled then was checked back from crowding at the break, angled out leaving the bend and had no late bid. CHRISTY ATTACK improved position
some from between rivals on the turn then flattened for the drive. DIAMOND STELLAR steadily faded from along the inside.
