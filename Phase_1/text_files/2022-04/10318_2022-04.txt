chased the pace from the outside, then swung out five wide at the top of the stretch, was closing well to prove second best. BOLD EXCAPER settled along
the rail, then continued to bid around the turn, split rivals mid stretch and closed willingly in the end. BEHIND THE CURTAIN stalked the pace while three
wide going into the turn made a bid but gave way in late stretch. ELTONSINGSTHEBLUES pressed the leader while two wide, was in a hard drive on the
turn then tired in late stretch. DOCTOR DO LITTLE raced while two wide, then checked and steadied in late backstretch, then made a two wide bid on the
turn but was no menace. APPRECIABLE chased the leader while three wide, then veered in toward the rail, made a bid then faded. There was a
STEWARDS INQUIRY in regarding the run down on the backstretch. After reviewing the replay, no action was taken.

five wide on the backstretch, chased the pace while three wide on the turn making a bid but came up empty in late stretch. UNCLE BUFF was unhurried
early then rallied three wide in the stretch and closed willingly in late stretch but was no menace. STORMIN HANK was four wide on the backstretch then
forced in and shuffled back then rallied four wide in the stretch and was no threat. VALDINA DREAMS pressed the pace while two wide, was used up then
gave way. SPORT COAT was unhurried early and no threat. MR. G T O was inside into the turn and no threat. A steward's inquiry was held concerning the

Footnotes
SECRET BLARNEY chased the pace while two wide, was gaining on the turn, then bore in at the top of the stretch, gained the lead to draw off in late
stretch for the win. KINGSTEN'S GOLD stalked the pace while three wide, continued to bid on the turn, was squeezed and taken back, then gamely came
again to be up for the place. ROUSING SLAMMER was away fastest, had the short lead then dueled from the inside, was in a hard drive but weakened in
deep stretch. RAMAAH was unhurried early then swung out five wide to rally mildly but flattened out in the end. DELIRIUM raced while two wide and was
evenly throughout and was no factor. DREAMONMEBABY dueled for the lead while two wide, was hard used after the turn and tired in the stretch drive.
FUNNY ACTOR chased the pace from the inside and failed to menace. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY and a JOCKEY'S OBJECTION, the rider of
KINGSTEN'S GOLD claimed foul against the rider of SECRET BLARNEY for interference at the top of the stretch. After reviewing the replay, there was no
change made to the order of finish.
