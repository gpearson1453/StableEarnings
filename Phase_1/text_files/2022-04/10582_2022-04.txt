Footnotes
FLORENCIA rated inside, bid outside in the stretch, was up in the final sixteenth and lasted against a late challenge. PARTY IN THE SAND lagged far
behind inside then closed well through final the furlong. QUIET PLEASE stalked the pacesetter, took over near the five sixteenths pole, bid clear but tired.
TAYLOR'S BELLE broke awkwardly, chased wide and flattened out late. MY MASTERPIECE controlled the fractions inside to midway on the final turn and
faded. I'M THIRSTY raced off the leaders three wide and was finished by the final turn.

was ridden out. WITHOUT A VIEW settled off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside and dug in gamely to
earn the place spot. ARDEAN chased outside a rival, moved up on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied and was outkicked for second. FLY FLY
BIRD was outrun early and closed belatedly outside. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly on the rail. SPRINKLE THIS
was bumped hard at the start, chased inside, chased on the turn and tired. RUBY DOOBY DOO broke in the air and was off slowly, raced off the pace and
did not factor. PINK VODKA was bumped hard at the start, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn and gave way.

CONDESCENDING broke alertly and quickly moved clear and stayed safe in a mild drive. CHANCE OCCURRENCE raced in closest pursuit of her
stablemate and continued gamely. AMIRA WINS was put to urging early and raced gamely just missing the place. MY TRUE PASSION chased outside and
went evenly in the final furlong. NOW ACT SURPRISED dropped back inside and was always outrun. ENCHANTED PRINCESS broke slowly, took a bad
step soon after and raced far back.

SOPHOS raced off the pace inside, moved up inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled with SAILOR AGAIN in the final furlong
and prevailed determinedly. SAILOR AGAIN set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, raced off the rail turning for home, dug in
gamely in the two path in the stretch drive and dueled with the winner to the finish. LAWLESSNESS was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, advanced inside
on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and rallied mildly between rivals for third. FEARLESS FLY tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled
out in upper stretch and rallied mildly outside. JARLIAN stalked the pacesetter, moved up on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, rallied four wide into the
stretch and was outkicked. COMMISSIONER DAVE was off slowly, outrun early and closed belatedly inside. MONGOLIAN HERO stumbled badly at the
start, raced three wide early, stalked between rivals and gave way. TELLER raced four wide early, then stalked three wide, gave way and was eased up in
the lane.

Footnotes
MOUNTAIN LILLY quickly took control, widened on the turn and remained well clear under moderate pressure. LA REGALADA came in early crowding rival,
advanced inside then angled out in the stretch rallying to be easily second best. CUP OF LIFE squeezed back at the start, moved wide in the stretch closing
well. SANTAFE EXPRESS chased within range three wide then flattened out in the stretch. SHEWEARSTHEPANTS pursued the winner to midstretch and
weakened. OUTLINE angled inside into the far turn and lacked a rally. CINNAMON DREAM dropped back early and trailed throughout. A claim of foul by
the third finisher against the second finisher for interference at the start was dismissed.

finish. FULL SEND dueled three wide for the lead, dueled inside on the turn, battled it out with EXPLAIN in the stretch drive and dug in gamely on the rail to
the end. E T'S SUPER STAR was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn and closed belatedly. I'M BLAMING YOU was bumped at the start, chased the
pace, chased two wide on the turn and tired. THE METHOD was checked after the start, outrun early and passed tired rivals. INVENTIONIST was bumped
