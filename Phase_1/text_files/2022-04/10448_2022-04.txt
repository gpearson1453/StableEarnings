Footnotes
SPEEDY ZEPHYR controlled the pace off the inside, repelled challenges and edged away again driving. GO SKIPPY GO saved ground throughout, bid on
the final turn, loomed a danger but could not get by the winner. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN chased wide throughout and flattened out in the stretch. KANE
raced between rivals early, faded on the final turn and was no factor. CALLMETHEBREEZE was urged close up three wide for five furlongs and gave way.
ENANO squeezed back at the start, took a bad step in the stretch when far back. PREFONTAINE prompted the winner for half a mile then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
MIKEY'S JEWEL broke a step slow, trailed the field, moved up between rivals on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, closed steadily inside,
gained command past the furlong marker and drew clear under urging. THE BIGGEST ONE vied inside for the lead, dueled with LIAM'S LADY on the
backside and far turn, dug in gamely in the stretch run and came up second best. LIAM'S LADY vied two wide for the lead, then dueled, dug in turning for
home, weakened and stayed on for the show spot. CORBALLY tracked on the inside, stalked the dueling leaders, chased on the far turn and lacked a bid.
ALLEGRETTO stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn and tired. SPRITE'S LADY stalked two wide, raced three
wide on the far turn and faded. STARSHIP BLANCA raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced four wide entering the far turn and then flattened out.
AMERICAN MONEY raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
SUGAR STREAK forced the pace outside, took over after half a mile, quickly extended her margin and drew off handily. MINESHAFT MAGIC hustled to a
clear lead inside, was collared before the half, proved no match for the winner but continued willingly. MALIBU ANTHEM reserved inside, made a brief bid
into the stretch then flattened out. GLOWING STAR saved ground close up and began fading on the final turn. LIL TATER settled wide, advanced after half
a mile then weakened. FRISKY FEELING lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

SHOWING OFF raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, angled out nearing the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed
willingly late, charged to the front and drew clear in the final yards. MUTTLEY stalked close up outside, chased on the turn, bid three wide entering the
stretch, rallied to the front, then dug in gamely to the finish. THE TALENTED MR U pressed the pace in the early stages, chased on the turn, was in tight on
the rail and steadied at the top of the stretch, angled out at the eighth pole and came again for a share. ENFORCER set the pace on the inside, shook free
on the turn, dueled to midstretch and weakened. JUST DIVINE was bumped hard at the start and off last, trailed the field, then closed belatedly.
DADASHEV was bumped hard at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide and lacked a rally. ET'S TOY SOLDIER raced off the pace inside,
chased on the turn, lacked a bid and faded. ISSUING JUSTICE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. A Jockey's Objection by the rider of THE
TALENTED MR U against MUTTLEY was dismissed.

Footnotes
AHSAD pressed the pace outside, took over midway on the final turn, repelled a rival near midstretch and edged clear. SON OF A SAINT stalked lthe
eaders three wide, rallied into the stretch, loomed a threat but was outfinished late. LOUIE'S WISH moved clear along the rail early, was collared on the final
turn and weakened. TACTICAL PLAN lacked speed outside and flattened out through the stretch. THE ROBERT trailed early and passed rivals while never
a threat. AMERICAN FLEET was urged within range for half a mile and faded. RELISHMENT drifted very wide off the leaders and weakened steadily.
MONTELEONE broke awkwardly and dropped well behind and was always outrun.

Footnotes
WONDER CITY raced close up under rating, took over when ready into the far turn then drew away through the final eighth under moderate pressure.
SHEKNOWSTHEDRILL went after the winner on the final turn, proved no match but just lasted for the place. MARIANNA QUEEN saved ground early,
angled out on the final turn with a mild bid. I'LL MAKE IT COACH dropped back after the start, chased wide and lacked a rally. JANELLE DREAMS raced
inside off the leaders and was never a factor. SAME MOON trailed to the stretch then caught tiring rivals. CONNOISSEUR hustled to a clear advantage
early then was finished after half a mile. JULIET'S MUSIC was urged close up along the rail early then weakened steadily.

Footnotes
GRACE'S DRAMA stalked close up outside, rallied outside of SOUTHERN CENTS turning for home, gained a short lead, drew clear near the sixteenth
marker and then held on late. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, advanced on the turn, angled out, rallied,
finished well outside and needed a bit more. SOUTHERN CENTS bobbled at the break, set the pace, dueled with the winner entering the stretch, dug in and
weakened late. ATLANTIC AVENUE raced two wide off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. I'M A COCO PEBBLES raced three wide
off the pace, continued evenly and failed to threaten. CREEDIBILITY trailed the field, saved ground on the turn and passed tired rivals. BANGLE GAL
chased the pace in the early stages and faded in the lane. VERRAZANO VITTORIA chased close up on the inside, chased on the turn and tired in the
stretch run. SALLY O'PRADO was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. FOREST HALO raced off the rail, chased and gave
way.
