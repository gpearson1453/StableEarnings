Footnotes
CAMP PENDLETON brushed lightly with a rival at the start, raced inside a rival off the leading pair, took closer order on the turn while shifting out four wide
coming to the quarter pole, struck the lead outside the furlong marker, drifted out a bit in late stretch under steady urging but edged clear. DEJOHN quickly
moved clear to set the pace under light rating tactics, faced some pressure after the opening quarter, saved ground along the rail through the turn, held off
that earlier rival who continued to press but was no match for the winner. CAPTAIN CARDO was bumped at the break, moved forward to apply pressure
after the opening quarter, went two to three wide on the turn and was encouraged a bit at the three-eighths then asked all-out by the top of the stretch, was
outkicked but saved show honors. MANKLIN CREEK exchanged a light brush at the start, settled off the leaders, went four to five wide on the turn, drifted in
a bit in late stretch, evened out and missed third. LOULOVESTHERIVER bumped the outside rival at the start, chased briefly from outside a foe, dropped
back two to three wide on the turn, drifted in and out slightly in the stretch and came up empty. TRIPLE AMERICANO saved ground to no avail.
SHANGHAIED ASTORIA raced outside a foe at the rear, swung four wide into upper stretch and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SUPER LOVE was urged forward from the start, set the pace racing just off the rail, drifted out leaving the turn then drift in and out a bit in the lane but held
a rival at bay under steady handling. SUGAR GRAY LEONARD stalked the eventual winner, was within range three wide on the turn, could make no
headway in the stretch. RUN AWAY EMPIRE stalked the leading pair, went four wide on the turn, was no match for the leading pair. MY HANDSOME MAN
was just a bit fractious in the gate, carried five wide into the turn, angled inside a rival three deep about the three-eighths pole, failed to menace. SURPRISE
HELLO was in just a bit tight early on and guided nearer the rail, continued on or just off the rail and was never a threat. KING SERAF switched outside foes
heading up the backstretch, moved out from four to six wide later on the turn and failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
CRABS N BEER exchanged a light brush at the start, shifted in heading up the backstretch, saved ground along the rail through the turn, angled out at the
three-sixteenths then again at the furlong marker for room, drove past in late stretch. HE'S ORIENTATE bumped with a rival at the start, chased from
outside going four wide on the turn, was forced out a bit by the aforementioned near the eighths pole, ran on to get up for second. BARDOLINO exchanged
an inconsequential brush at the start, contended between runners for the lead going two wide on the turn, saved show honors. MONSTER MASON was
carried five wide outside runners into the turn, shifted inside a rival near the quarter pole as that one came out further, lacked room past the sixteenth pole,
steadied just slightly at that juncture and altered course out a path or so and regained momentum but had to settle for the minor award. RAD PAISLEY vied
inside, was outkicked. BOURBON AND ICE chased from between runners in the second flight, dropped back heading to the turn going two to three wide on
that bend, kept on late. BLOODPROF tracked inside, gradually shifted out on the turn coming past the quarter pole four wide, was within striking distance
but weakened in the stretch. SCIENCE (IRE) moved out from four wide to six wide late on the turn, failed to threaten. SMITTEN ENOUGH pressed from
outside three wide, weakened in the stretch and drifted in late. FLANK SPEED bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide into the turn, altered inside a
rival heading to the rail about the five-sixteenths, steadied in late stretch when a rival drifted in.

Footnotes
BEAR FORCE WON stalked the early leaders, made a swift advance outside four wide on the turn to challenge, was in command by the top of the stretch
and drifted in a bit, drew away under moderate hand-urging. ALL THREES raced just off the leaders, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, was no
match for the winner but gained the place. ROYAL THUNDER set the pace racing off the rail, went in the two path on the turn while challenged by outside
rivals, lacked the needed late kick. COMMANDING GENERAL was within range early, contended three wide and between through the turn, weakened.
SEVEN ON THE ROCKS dropped back from between runners heading to the turn, went three wide on that bend, swung out six deep turning for home and
improved position. SINGLINO angled in heading up the backstretch, steadied slightly about the nine-sixteenths when in tight, moved just off the rail on the
turn and further in the stretch but failed to rally. TENAX chased from inside, moved out a bit to the two path heading into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
I'M BLUSHING bumped the outer rival at the start, tucked in behind the leaders moving in three wide entering the turn and a bit nearer the rail later on that
bend, tracked behind the leaders, moved outside three wide to bid for the lead taking command late on the far turn, drew clear under urging and held safe.
CHARMED WAY was bumped into a rival at the start, settled tracking inside, saved ground till late on the far turn and came out three deep, was second
best. DATS A SUPERSTAR bumped a rival at the start, raced three wide in the back half of the field early, moved out and advanced four then five wide on
the far turn, evened out in the lane. SPELLBOOK settled well back along the inside, steadied when in tight quarters entering the far turn, angled eight wide
out of that bend, gained late but with too much to do. JOYFUL APPLAUSE hopped slightly at the start, moved in from four to three wide on the first turn, was
ridden along early up the backstretch, went two deep on the far turn before coming out at the top of the stretch, improved position. MRS. POSTMAN broke a
step slowly, moved in to go two wide on the first turn, came out heading up the backstretch, took the outside route six deep on the far turn, needed more
late. DATE NIGHT KISSES was close up early chasing two to three wide, weakened. BELLA BETTINA stumbled and was bumped at the start but quickly
recovered to set the pace inside, came up empty in the stretch. VIVI MY LOVE chased the early pace four to three wide through the first turn, continued the
pursuit two wide on the far turn, faded in the lane. BEAUCOUP BELL was bumped at the start, gave brief pursuit outside five then four wide on the first turn,
steadily dropped back five wide on the far turn and was empty for the stretch run. PRACTICAL KITTY shifted in early, went three then two wide on the first
turn, dropped back two deep on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
LUNA BELLE was allowed to settle last but one racing four wide on the first turn, moved in a bit heading to the far turn, began to pick it up under some
encouragement three then four wide on that bend, angled out five wide coming past the quarter for room, took charge and kicked clear under moderate
urging. KHULUQ tracked inside into the first turn, switched outside the leading pair, advanced three wide on those heading into the far turn, asked for a bit
more about three furlongs out, was no match for the winner but second best. CLICK TO CONFIRM raced outside four wide on both turns, was within striking
distance into the far turn, dropped back on that bend but kept on in the lane to gain show honors. CHARDONNAY set the pace inside, drifted out leaving the
far turn and again about the three-sixteenths, came up empty. ZAWISH pursued the pacesetter three then two wide on the first turn, pressed into the far turn
two deep, angled inside that rival at the top of the stretch as that one drifted out, offered no late bid. ABIDALE saved ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DISCO PHAROAH exchanged a light bump just after the start, was allowed to settle into stride while switching outside foes, advanced four wide on the turn,
took charge at the top of the stretch, kicked clear and held safe while being kept to the task. MOHAAFETH switched off the inside early, advanced four wide
on the turn, won a prolonged battle for the place over THREES OVER DEUCES, who bumped with the winner just after the break, encouraged along at that
juncture to track in behind the leaders two wide, moved out three deep at the quarter pole and four wide turning for home, fought for the place but missed.
YOUNGEST OF FIVE tracked inside, came out a path past the quarter pole, ran on. WAR TOCSIN pressed the pace three wide, made a mild bid between
runners late on the far turn, lugged out a bit in upper stretch and weakened. SIR ALFRED JAMES switched off the inside heading up the backstretch, went
three wide on the turn, ran evenly. BORRACHO set the pace inside just off the rail, moved nearer the rail past the quarter pole, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
PENNYBAKER stalked the pace, edged closer four to five wide on the turn, was in command at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit at that juncture, kicked
clear and was geared down late. FILLE D'ESPRIT broke outwardly just a bit, pressed the pace from outside going three then four wide on the turn and
taking a brief lead on that bend, was no match for the winner. MOMA TIGER settled just off the leaders racing outside, went five to six wide on the turn, got
up for show honors at the wire. SHALIMAR GARDENS set the pace racing off the rail, lacked the needed late kick and lost show honors late. PRIMACY was
in a bit tight just after the break, raced in the back half of the field four wide into the turn, moved to the rail near the quarter pole, improved position. FLIGHT
TO SHANGHAI tracked inside, came out a bit late on the turn and further in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. ARTFUL SPLATTER exchanged a
light brush early, chased in behind the leaders three wide through the turn coming out wider into upper stretch, failed to rally. MISS LESLIE switched off the
inside, moved out from three wide early on the turn to swing eight deep into upper stretch while advancing past some rivals but could not sustain the effort.
SHARP STARR exchanged a brush in the early going, was outpaced chasing four wide through the turn, failed to menace. SWEET WILLEMINA was urged
forward chasing inside, came up empty. FINDING FAME failed to threaten after going three wide on the turn. HASHTAG LUCKY shifted in early, went two
wide on the turn, retreated and steadied slightly near the three-eighths and was not a threat.

Footnotes
CHICA RABIOSA exchanged a bump at the start, moved through inside the leader to take command at the half, moved clear into upper stretch and held
safe. STARTWITHABANG settled well back of the leaders, went in the two path on the turn, had room between runners in upper stretch, secured the place.
MONARCH BEACH bobbled just slightly at the start, tracked inside, steadily dropped back and switched out, moved out further shifting five wide turning for
home, ran on to gain late. MARTHARITA exchanged a bump at the start, saved ground inside, lacked the needed late kick. KINKY FROLIC chased the
leading pair into the turn going three to four wide, evened out thereafter. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL raced off the pace, went three to four wide into the turn, was
carried six wide out of that bend, failed to menace. SPANIKOPITA pulled a bit against the rider's restraint while dictating the early tempo, chased the new
leader into the turn three wide, came up empty.
