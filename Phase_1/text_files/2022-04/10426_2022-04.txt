Footnotes
COCO BRAVADO raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn in the three path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and
gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane to pull clear late. JUST RIGHT MIKE led the field through the opening quarter of a mile, extended his
lead while saving ground around the turn, continued to show the way in upper stretch and was caught late, the best of the rest. SIR ACEALOT chased the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, flattened out approaching the eighth pole and just held third. DARE GOES DA DEVIL
trailed the field on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground mildly in late stretch while never threatening the top
two. ALPINE GHOST tracked the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HIDENSEEK SALLY shook to a narrow lead past the five eighths while prompted by GO STORMIN GIRL, edged clear past the half, set the pace in the two
path on the turn, was pushed along in upper stretch and briefly driven midstretch, and drew off. GO STORMIN GIRL pressed the early pace inside of
HIDENSEEK SALLY, tracked the leader past the half, saved ground through the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, could not reel in the pacesetter but
kept on a clear second best. FLYING BUSINESS broke with the main line, tracked the leading pair from past the five eighths, tracked the leader two wide on
the turn, floated five wide into the lane and went to a drive in upper stretch, and chased on mildly while no match for the leading pair. WINNING QUALITY
broke at the inside of the main line, was taken back past the five eighths, entered the turn at the rear of the main group inside of HEY HEY, raced in the two
to three path around the bend, offered a brief inside bid into the lane, but flattened out from midstretch. HEY HEY settled near the rear early, raced at the
rear of the main group two wide into the turn, was pushed along in the four path past the seven sixteenths, swung six wide into the lane, went to a drive
midstretch and offered no kick. SINGING ALLI was in tight between horses and took back in the opening strides, trailed in the four path on the turn, swung
four wide into the lane and offered no rally.

Footnotes
CHINA STAR led the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout, and drew off down the lane, much the best. AMARI S. saved ground
around the first turn, chased the leader in tight quarters on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid while racing in the two path around the turn and was
no match for the the winner, chasing that rival home. SANGFROID hit the gate and bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, raced in the two path
around the first turn, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was outkicked in the
stretch while finishing evenly. WEEKEND PASS brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced three wide around the first turn, stalked the
pacesetter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two and three path and faded in the stretch. RULER DAENERYS raced at the
back of the pack in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field from the rail up the backstretch and around the far turn and was never a factor. CHINA
STAR RAN FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES broke well but settled at the rear of the main pack, chased in range inside down the back straight, began to improve in earnest in the
three to four path past the seven sixteenths, was driven inside foes into the lane, rallied up the inside, led approaching the furlong mark and cleared off.
DARING DAMSEL raced at the inside of the tracking flight into the first turn, settled back to chase inside, continued in range behind the leading flight into
the far turn, was pushed along to improve, split horses near the three eighths to get around a tiring foe, engaged inside of WATCHIN THE WHEELS
approaching the five sixteenths, led into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, was headed by KIMBERLY FRANCES nearing the furlong mark, and chased
on second best. ON A TOUR tracked the leader three wide between horses around the clubhouse turn and into the back straight, chased two deep behind
the leading flight past the nine sixteenths, improved three wide around the far turn, loomed outside the leading pair near the five sixteenths, kept on in range
through upper stretch, and was outfinished for place while drifting out late. WATCHIN THE WHEELS tracked the leader between horses into the clubhouse
turn, raced two wide in the tracking flight down the backstretch, encroached outside of SILVERA near the nine sixteenths, inherited a defined lead after
SILVERA took up near the seven sixteenths, led while positioned two wide around the far turn, was confronted from the inside by DARING DAMSEL
approaching the five sixteenths, proved no match into the lane, chased on through midstretch and weakened in the final furlong. LITTLE CHICK soon
trailed, began to take closer order in the three to four path on the far turn, and passed tiring horses. SILVERA was placed on the lead, was confronted by
WATCHIN THE WHEELS near the nine sixteenths, took up near the seven sixteenths, weakened inside around the far turn and had no more in the lane.
IRISH HALO tracked the leader four wide through the clubhouse turn, chased in range five wide down the backstretch, began to back up past the five
eighths, weakened in the three path on the far turn and had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SMUGGLER'S GHOST chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole,
gained ground on the outside down the lane and pulled clear in the final furlong. PACHI led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while
racing in the two path around the turn, was caught passing the eighth pole and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. TRY TRY AGAIN trailed the
field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, and improved position mildly in late stretch but was no match. COMFORT
ME NOW raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly.
DOLLAR BLUE raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the early going, saved ground around the turn and flattened out late. MAGI raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the turn and continued to tire
from there.

MEDAL OF FACT was sent for speed and taken to the inside, maintained a narrow lead around the turn while pressed by HERE COMES KYLE, edged
away midstretch, and increased his advantage late under a hand ride. ARCHIEMYBOY raced four wide in the tracking flight, was driven five wide in upper
stretch to chase the leading pair, and kept on willingly to get up for place. HERE COMES KYLE prompted the leader while racing two wide between horses,
continued in close range of the leader when put to a drive in upper stretch, proved no match for the pacesetter in the final furlong and lost the place late. LT.
JUNIOR GRADE broke well, settled behind MEDAL OF FACT at the inside of the tracking flight, chased in the two path around the bend, was ddriven inside
in upper stretch, and lacked the needed kick in the lane. CROSSTOWN SHOOTOUT was anxious in the gate, settled at the rear early, raced into the turn
two wide in the rear flight, dropped to the inside in front of TWO COOKIE RULE near the three eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch while under a
drive, shifted six wide midstretch, and rallied belatedly. JOLTING JOE settled at the rear early, continued toward the rear in the three to four path on the
turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and improved mildly late past tiring horses. BACKSHOT chased just behind the tracking flight down the backstretch
and in the three to four path on the turn, swung five wide under a drive into the lane, and lacked the needed rally between horses. LAUDA SPEED tracked
three wide between horses, was no match for the leaders into the lane but continued to chase to midstretch, and emptied out late. TWO COOKIE RULE
broke with the field but gradually settled back to last, raced at the inside of the rear pair into the turn, continued in the two to three path around the bend,
and had no rally.

Footnotes
VALIANT VINNY was placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out, but nonetheless held to the
wire. SILK TRADE tracked the leading pair inside early, continued to chase the leading pair in the three path into the turn, was pushed along from the three
eighths, went to a drive into the lane, shifted four wide in upper stretch, drifted out but nonetheless kicked on with his best near the sixteenth, and just
missed. BASEBALL POLITICS tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the two to three path on the turn, proved no match for VALIANT VINNY in
upper stretch, chased on willingly but was outfinished for the place. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS raced three wide toward the rear early, made a bid in the four
path on the turn, was outkicked into upper stretch, and chased on evenly late. ALEBRIJE raced inside toward the rear early, chased while saving ground
around the turn, was urged for a bid inside foes into the lane and improved in upper stretch, and flattened out late. THRILL RIDE settled near the rear, raced
between horses in the five path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and chased on without finding enough to threaten. FIRST MASAMUNE raced
between horses toward the rear early, continued near the rear in the six path on the turn, came seven wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses late.
TWIRLING ROSES settled at the rear, raced toward the rear in the four path on the turn, was driven into the lane in the three path and offered mild
improvement, but weakened in the final furlong. TOM'S LAST GENERAL chased the leading pair outside of SILK TRADE early, weakened in the three to
four path around the turn, came into the lane between horses, and had no response under a drive.
