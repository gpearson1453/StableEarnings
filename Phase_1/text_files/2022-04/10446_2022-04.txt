Footnotes
MR. GORDY set the pace from the outset, raced in the two path through the turn, drew clear down the lane and held safely in the final stages. RYVIT was
slow and broke in at the start, raced back early on, was in the three path along the turn, in the six path into the lane and rallied for place in the final stages.
LONE LEADER broke slowly at the start, chased the pace early, was on the inside into the lane, raced in the four path into the lane with a mild gain in the
stretch run. TOP OF MY GAME tracked the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the
stretch drive. TWIST OF FAITH stalked the pace early on, raced in the three path through the turn, wandered down the lane while fading. ALIBI IKE was
slow and bothered at the start, blocked a bit along the turn close to the rail, was in the two to three path entering the lane while empty down the lane. TIA
FRIDA was always outrun.

Footnotes
NEPOTISM broke out at the start, stalked the early pace two wide, took over command near the three eighths pole, was in the two path into the lane and
drew off down the lane while ridden out to the wire. MAKE WAY tracked the pace early on, raced on the inside along the turns, was in the two path into the
lane and no match for the winner in the stretch run. BROWN DELIVERS was bumped and bothered at the start, raced in the four path along the first turn,
made a bid three wide near the three eighths pole, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch drive. VITAL SIGNS was bumped and
bothered at the start, raced in the five path along the first turn, made a bid from between horses near the three eighths pole, was in the three path into the
lane and faded late in the stretch. TOLKIEN raced in the two path along the first turn and was back early on, raced in the four path into the lane and leveled
off down the lane. JEDREK came out at the start, set the pace early on, raced on the inside along the far turn, was in the two path into the lane and gave
way down the lane. CALIFORNIA FLIRT was never a factor. BRODY'S FLY was bothered at the start and done early.

final stages. LITTLE BLAZE set the pace early on, raced in the two path through the turn, was under a long drive down the lane and yielded in the late
stages. MERCI ROAD stalked the pace early two wide, raced in the three path through the turn, was under a long drive in the stretch three wide but
weakened late in the drive. RUNAWAY WIFE trailed the field early on, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid down the lane but flattened out late in the
drive. WEST LOVE came in at the start, chased the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane and faded late in the
stretch. ONE FULL MOON was a bit slow at the start and never a threat. STEAL MY SUNSHINE raced on the inside along the turn, was in the two path into
the lane and never fired down the lane. CHARGING LADY raced in the four path along the turn, was in the six path into the lane and never a factor. SURF
BALLROOM was bumped at the start, tracked the pace early on, raced in the four path into the lane and was empty down the lane, vanned off after the

CONAGHER vied four wide early on, then two wide into the turn, disposed of his inner counterpart approaching the final five sixteenths while well in hand,
widened his margin in upper stretch under driving pressure, and held sway under strong urging through the late stages. VARATTI broke a bit flat-footed and
was sent to try to achieve early position, tracked in midpack four wide into the turn under steady urging, inched forward turning for home, kept on under a
stiff drive to bid for place at the furlong grounds, and secured that position. MICKY FROM WEXFORD broke a step slowly, tracked from off of the pace in
the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane while attempting to launch a charge for minor placings, then stayed on in the six path through the final
furlong to reach show at the wire. SKY AND SAND prompted three wide and between horses through the opening furlong, backed off to stalk the top pair
approaching the half mile pole, chased those rivals from the three path into the turn, gained place passing the five sixteenths pole as CONAGHER assumed
command, but failed to keep pace with that one in upper stretch, tired in the final furlong, and lost show late. UNDERHILL'S TAB chased the leading group
three wide while under steady urging to keep pace, got shuffled back slightly behind a faltering LA BELLEZA NEGRA approaching the turn, sustained a
chase in the three to four path, then shifted inwardly in upper stretch, and failed to bid. OVERBORE broke a beat slowly, got hung out in the five path around
the turn while attempting a rally from off of the pace, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, but failed to threaten. BUCKINGHAM PRINCE took the turn
in the five path while far off of the pace, and failed to menace. UNPREDICTABLE BAY failed to factor. KISSALOT trailed around the turn, and made little
impact. LA BELLEZA NEGRA was forward between leaders early on, but failed to keep pace after a furlong, chased between rivals into the turn, but tired.
INDIA INK vied for the lead along the inside, but failed to keep pace approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened. SISAWAY NOW tracked along the
inside, but came under a drive at the three furlong pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
EL KABONG stalked comfortably along the inside, bid along the rail in upper stretch through a wide seam after the leader vacated the inside, drew clear
approaching the furlong grounds, and held sway through the late stages. WIN WORTHY settled off of the pace two wide, took the far turn in the three path
before shifting to the six path entering the lane, got nudged to the seven path while being outkicked by an inner foe, picked up stride shortly after, rallied
outside of foes to bid for place entering the final sixteenth, and claimed that position shortly after while gaining on the clear leader. ARABIAN PRINCE
tracked two wide and between horses, shifted to the four path in upper stretch while inside of KING VEGA (GB), chased among rivals in pursuit of the clear
leader entering the final furlong, vied for place approaching the final sixteenth, but was outkicked leaving that station, then kept on to prevail over the
aforementioned foe for show. KING VEGA (GB) stalked three wide, ranged up turning for home before drifting to the five path entering the lane, hung on his
left lead while bidding in upper stretch, got outkicked by an inner foe approaching the furlong grounds, vied for place between rivals in pursuit of the clear
leader, but was outkicked for that position by rivals both sides entering the final sixteenth while flattening out. DANVILLE rated off of the pace along the
inside, then in the two path around the far turn, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and improved between horses late. AVIANO tracked from midpack in
the three to four paths, nudged an outer foe while shifting to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally between horses. COURAGEOUSLY set the pace
along the inside, but vacated the rail entering the lane, which allowed for the eventual winner to shoot through along the rail, proved no match for that foe
approaching the final furlong, and faded. COOL RAGS trailed, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and failed to factor. LANDBISCUIT prompted the
pace two wide, but was outkicked in upper stretch before faltering between horses at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
BUCK MOON set a clear pace in the three path early on, showed the way from a pair of outer pressers into the far turn, managed an advantage in hand
while STAGE RAIDER continued to pursue turning for home, responded readily when set down entering the lane, shook clear in upper stretch, and held firm
as the aforementioned foe sustained his chase through the lane. STAGE RAIDER was fractious in the gate awaiting the start, stalked two wide while in the
four path around the first turn, moved to press the leader from the three path into the far turn, but briefly failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane,
chased well thereafter, but was only second best. LAUGHING BOY tracked in the five path early on, chased the leading pair from the three path around the
far turn while under strong urging, claimed show approaching the lane, and managed that position while no threatening the leading pair. MILITARIST settled
off of the pace in the two path, but came under a drive between horses entering the far turn, and churned on through the lane to improve mildly between
horses in the late stages. PORTOS stalked along the inside, was roused to attempt a bid two wide and between horses approaching the far turn, but failed
to keep pace with rivals on either side leaving the five sixteenths pole while under a stern drive. PIRATE'S PUNCH laid off of the pace while hung out in the
four to six paths around the turns, and failed to factor. WHO'S THE STAR was restless in the gate pre-race, then broke a beat slowly, saved ground far off
of the pace, improved inside of rivals into the far turn, chased from midpack around that bend, then faded through the lane. HIDDEN STASH rated far back
two wide and between horses early on, then took the far turn in the four path and failed to factor. WINTER POOL trailed three wide, took the far turn in the
four to five path, and was outrun.

Footnotes
MERCY WARREN pressed two wide, led at the three furlong pole when her inner counterpart faltered, felt outer pressure turning for home, but drew off in
upper stretch, and was ridden out under intermediate hand urging. RUNNIN HAPPY stalked three wide, pressed the leader turning for home, but proved no
match for that foe in upper stretch, and was second best. SANTA ELENA chased four wide, sustained position around the turn while outside of the leaders,
then failed to keep pace in upper stretch. RISATA bobbled a bit and bumped an outer rival at the start, rushed along the inside early on, but steadied when
running up on the leader's heels at the eleven sixteenths pole, trailed shortly after, and never got involved. DREAM MUSIC took a bump from an inner foe at
the start, set the pace inside of the pressing eventual winner, but faltered into the turn, and quickly stopped.
