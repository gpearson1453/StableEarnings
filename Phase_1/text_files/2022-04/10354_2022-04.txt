Footnotes
BELLA D reserved in the early going, went two wide into the turn, angled out crossing the turn, tipped out further in the lane, drew alongside the leader past
the eighth pole, took over past the sixteenth marker, got bumped by YOUTE late and prevailed. YOUTE tracked off the rail, went four wide into the turn,
came out and exited the bend seven wide, rallied widest of all, then drifted in and bumped BELLA D late and could not get by. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA sped
to the front, led two then three wide around the turn, challenged from outside with a furlong left to run, clung to a narrow advantage at the sixteenth pole and
succumbed to the pressure late. PISTACHIO PRINCESS pulled early off the pace, continued to tug while behind a rival on the turn, angled out at the top of
the stretch and needed to find more in the final furlong. TEDDY'S BARINO rated early behind the speed, moved to the rail for the turn, came two wide into
the stretch and lacked a bid in the drive. SHE'S A DIME forwardly placed then checked behind the leader early, chased three wide into the turn, became
rank and drifted across the dirt, continued to be hard to toss his head in upper stretch and faded down the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS RULED THAT YOUTE DRIFTED IN AND INITIATED THE CONTACT WITH BELLA D LATE IN THE STRETCH AND THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE.

Footnotes
BUSY PAYNTER stumbled and bumped at the start, recovered quickly and went up duel briefly, could not keep pace past the half-mile pole, lost action
approaching the seven-sixteenths pole which cost her some ground, chased in the two path while cutting into the lead around the bend, drew alongside the
leader and took over in upper stretch, put away that foe in midstretch and drew away. VELLA bobbled at the start, chased widest up the backstretch, took
the turn three wide and got up for second. MAJESTIC GIGI dueled briefly with BUSY PAYNTER then cleared at the half-mile pole, opened up a comfortable
lead into the turn, held a diminishing lead into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and got edged for the place. ANA LISA sat off the pace, rounded
the turn two then three wide, tipped out in the stretch and failed to threaten. SCREAM AND SHOUT bumped leaving the gate, chased inside through the
turn and weakened.

Footnotes
NEWPARK (IRE) took control early and crossed over to the inside, saved ground showing the way through the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was
kept to task to the wire. SANTOS TO WILSON was closest in pursuit off the rail, took aim two wide into the stretch, could not threaten the winner in the final
furlong but stayed on to secure second. CHERUBIC FACTOR hopped at the start to come away last, trailed up the backstretch while moving inside, swung
out leaving the turn, summoned a late rally and missed the show. MY SUMMER DREAM raced three deep early then chased between rivals, raced two wide
in the clear to the stretch, summoned a mild rally and missed the show. TOO LATE broke well then was rated in a stalking position outside rivals, traveled
three then two wide on the turn, moved out in the lane and could not rally. FARQUHAR took awkward step crossing surfaces early then was taken back,
raced along the rail then steered three wide leaving the bend, went between runners in the furlong grounds and got put in tight late. MAJESTIC WIND
traveled between rivals early then moved closer up the inside, saved ground around the turn and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
PINEDALE chased three wide on the first turn, traveled outside a rival up the backstretch, was driven three wide into the lane, rallied steadily in the lane and
overhauled LIL LIGHT HEADED in the final sixteenth. MONGOLIAN BONUS dropped back early and trailed two wide on the first turn, coaxed along on the
backstretch, angled four wide on the second turn, summoned a late rally and gained second. LIL LIGHT HEADED stumbled and bumped with inner rival,
sped to the front, showed the way up the backstretch, felt a bit of pressure on the second bend, cleared with a quarter mile left to run, opened up in upper
stretch, then weakened late and yielded to the top pair. WHISKEY VISION got shuffled between runners early then tucked inside on the first turn, moved
closer under urging in the middle stages, went between rivals and brushed with MISSING MAURICE at the seven-sixteenths pole, continued between
runners then two wide into the lane, finished well and rounded out the superfecta. MISSING MAURICE chased off the rail, brushed with inner rivals three
deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, raced between foes and got put in tight near the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch and put in a mild
late bid. BIG EVENT raced up close on the inside, lost ground leaving the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn, steadied behind DIVINELY DIVERSE
in the stretch and tipped out and had little left for the drive. KING ROB had to go five wide through both turns and came up empty in the stretch. DIVINELY
DIVERSE stalked outside a rival behind the pacesetter, asked two wide on the far turn, lost touch with the leader with a quarter mile left to run, moved to the
rail at the top of the stretch and tired. TRIBUTE TO AFLEET got crowded leaving the gate, went four wide around the first turn, remained well off the rail into
the second bend, steered down to the rail and tired.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONAFFAIR tracked from inside off the pace, ran up on heels while gaining ground and checked hard at the five-eighths pole, waited for room
on the far turn, bid inside rivals at the top of the stretch, quickly took control nearing the eighth pole, surged clear and coasted in while drawing away.
ENCROACHMENT tracked two then three wide around the first turn, attended the pace three deep on the backstretch, challenged from outside on the far
turn and dueled into the stretch, took command in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. BORDER TOWN was off slow in the
beginning, moved into striking distance on the backstretch, steered four wide leaving the far turn, bid outside a trio of rivals in upper stretch but faltered in
the furlong grounds. SNIPER KITTEN angled to the inside early, shifted three wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch and improved position. KAZAN
(IRE) off slow to begin, tucked inside at the back on the first turn, moved to the two path for the second bend, angled four wide leaving the turn and could
not rally. HURRICANE CLOUD (GB) lost his footing at the start and came away very slow, moved into range from outside in the middle stages, drifted six
wide on the far turn and was not a factor. SILVER SUMMER chased two wide early then moved up to duel for command on the backstretch, inched ahead
on the far turn, put away STONE'S RIVER then dueled with ENCROACHMENT leaving the bend and gave way in the lane. STONE'S RIVER took control
from inside, dueled with rival up the backstretch and far turn, lost contact with a quarter mile left to run, steadied in tight entering the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
GOOD BYE PUTIN lacked early speed, steered to the inside, gained ground around the turn and tipped three wide, rallied steadily through the lane, collared
the leader past the sixteenth pole, took control and prevailed over BIG SCOTT DADDY in the closing moments. BIG SCOTT DADDY bumped lightly leaving
the gate, got impeded and force to check hard early, chased two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the lane, closed gamely from outside
but was too late. QUANTUM QUEST broke out and bumped rival at the start, sped clear up the backstretch, showed the way in the two path into the stretch,
drifted to the rail and weakened late. TOM BOMBADIL broke slow, got forced out early, chased three then four wide around the turn and finished evenly in
the final furlong. WINK AND A DREAM traveled near the back of the pack in the early going, lacked room behind weakening rival at the three-eighths pole,
angled out to the five path around the bend and kept on to improve. MUSICAL GEM stalked off the rail, exited the turn three wide and weakened. IM STILL
THIRSTY hustled from inside to chase the pacesetter, saved ground to the lane and weakened. KIMMER got forced out and bumped with MEDINA MAN
early, raced in mid-pack and steered to the inside, angled out and entered the stretch four wide and could not rally. MEDINA MAN got bumped from inside
and forced out early, altered out a bit at the seven-sixteenths pole, was floated six wide on the turn then angled down to to the three path around the bend
and came up empty. WICKED BLUE swerved out early, raced in range off the inside, dropped back into the turn, eased out and entered the lane six wide
and tired.

Footnotes
SOMMER DAISY (FR) set the pace on the inside, took pressure on the far turn, shook free into the lane and padded the lead under mild urging. NOBLE
HEARTED stalked the pace from inside to the stretch, brushed with rival while tipped out, could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but proved
second best. WITCH MOON traveled two wide off the pace early on, angled four wide leaving the far turn, showed a mild response and edged LOOKIN SO
LUCKY for third. LOOKIN SO LUCKY raced in range early on, went three wide around the second bend, tipped out in the stretch and got outkicked for the
show. DERBY QUEST tucked inside at the back, moved off the rail and went two wide into second bend, steered out to the five path leaving the turn, angled
to the inside in the stretch and failed to rally. TAPIT DOUX raced up close off the rail, bid outside on the far turn, failed to keep up into the stretch, brushed
with rival in upper stretch and weakened. BEACHGRASS hit the gate and came away slow, pulled around the first turn on the inside, chased two wide into
the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
HOLDEN THE LUTE showed speed from outside, took the first turn four then three wide, chased the pacesetter from outside, bid two wide past the
seven-sixteenths pole, took over midway around the bend, cleared nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a strong handling and a tap of left-handed
encouragement. PROVERB tracked along the rail the moved out on the first turn, urged around the second bend, entered the lane between rivals and
bested the rest. MOTOWN MUSIC got shuffled back a bit entering the first turn, chased three then four wide around that bend, rounded the far turn three
wide, lost the whip at the top of the stretch and kept on for a clear third. DIRECT LINE sent between early and traveled three then two wide on the first turn,
set the pace up the backstretch, overtaken midway around the far tur and gave way. OWNING sent early and vied two wide into the first turn, moved to the
rail while unable to keep up with the leader, dropped back to last under urging in them middle stages, trailed two wide into the lane, eased in the drive and
walked off.

Footnotes
STREET RUCKUS attended the pace three deep, bid three wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, held command over rivals on both sides into
the final sixteenth and stave off the late bid from SEVEN CHARMS in the end. SEVEN CHARMS broke well from outside, tracked two wide off the pace,
drew closer around the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased within striking distance through the drive, dug in late, could not get by the winner but
proved a game second. LA LA LAND (IRE) got crowded a bit between early then angled to the inside early, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, tipped
two wide on the second bend, angled to the inside and bid along the fence but faltered in the late stages. BEE CATCHER turned his head, bobbled and lost
path at the start, went two wide around the first turn, moved out on the backstretch, went three deep into the far turn, steered out five wide around the bend,
gained a minor award but needed to find more in the furlong grounds. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) pressed the pace between rivals, took over midway around the
far turn, fought with STREET RUCKUS into the stretch, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened. EAST RAND tossed his head leaving the gate,
raced near the back of the pack, angled four wide around the far turn and could not rally. WILLY THE COBBLER got put in a bit tight and steadied along the
rail first time through the stretch, trailed two wide into the stretch and was not a factor. ROSENQUIST off alertly and took control from inside, set the pace
with a pair of rivals to the outside, lost command midway around the far turn, started to weaken late on the bend and tired in the lane.
