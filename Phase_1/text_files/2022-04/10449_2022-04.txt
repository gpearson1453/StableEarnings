WASSER, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders to the backstretch, made a steady advance to challenge outside the pacesetter on the far
turn, took over nearing upper stretch and went well clear under strong handling. ONLY GIRL tracked the leader from just out of striking position racing four
wide to the backstretch, continued three deep on the far turn and proved best of the others entering the lane while no threat to the winner. KILKENNY
BELLA, in touch prompting a rival's pace racing into the backstretch, moved to gain the advantage leaving the five furlong marker, dictated the pace on a
narrow advantage into the far turn, was headed nearing upper stretch and proved no match for the top pair in the last quarter. AMAZING MSKITTY, broke
slowly, then was bumped at the start, tipped out racing into the backstretch gaining some position after a half, then continued evenly racing in three path to
the stretch. J'S STAR JET, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the break to the first turn, gave way nearing the midway point of the backstretch.
BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA was settled into stride near the inside and soon dropped out of contention.

Footnotes
FORTUNATE FRIENDS tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, conceded some position nearing the far turn while shifting off the
inside, came around a tiring foe entering the far turn, angled to the rail to bid inside rivals when presented an opening in upper stretch, wrested the
advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. IRISH VALOR broke inwards bumping SAVVY LAYLA, was settled outside foes racing
to the first turn, shifted four wide after a half, was prompted to advance three wide on the far turn, was fanned four wide entering the lane and contested the
issue past midstretch but was outkicked. ODDS ON, urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the backstretch, gained the advantage between calls
nearing the far turn, dueled for command a bit off the rail into upper stretch and weakened between rivals in the final sixteenth. SAVVY LAYLA, bumped at
the start, tracked off the first flight three deep to the backstretch, moved to press the issue between foes on the far turn and faded in the drive. KRAMDEN
was urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

END ALL GET ALL was settled outside foes to the backstretch, came under prompting to advance three wide on the far turn, moved to challenge in that
path racing into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm left handed encouragement. SNAP HOOK angled to the rail in early stages
while being urged to dispute the pace inside a rival, pressed the issue through the backstretch to the far turn, lost some ground to the pacesetter midway
through the far turn, tipped outside that rival nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to edge that rival for the place honors late while no
match for the winner. BROADWAY PETE broke sharply, tipped off the rail racing into the first turn, was urged pressing the pace outside a rival through the
backstretch, edged clear leaving the midway point of the far turn, but failed to sustain his momentum once headed by the winner in upper stretch. CANDY
CRUSHEM settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch while angling inside, saved ground through the far turn to the lane but offered no rally.
KIGER tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane. ONLYAMATTEROFTIME broke in the air, then
stumbled at the start, lost contact with the field racing to the backstetch but walked off the course under his own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

FINERY was settled outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, made a sharp rally three wide when given her cue entering the far
turn to gain terms with the pacesetter in upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and went well clear under strong left handed pressure. FREEDOM
ROSE angled to the inside tracking the leaders from just out of striking distance to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, then came through inside a
rival to narrowly prevail for the place honors late. KITTEN'S COLLUSION settled while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the
far turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to gain some position while missing for second. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT,
forwardly placed tracking the pacesetter in the opening half, advanced on that foe to wrest the advantage racing through the far turn but failed to sustain her
momentum. MINING CHROME was settled between foes racing in the last flight to the backstretch, was forced out four wide avoiding traffic leaving the
quarter mile marker and had no closing response. LA ROSA tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn, was taken up, then
altered course outside TOUR FOR GOLD nearing upper stretch and quickly dropped out. TOUR FOR GOLD was urged to the lead along the rail leaving the
chute, set the pace on a clear margin to the far turn, drifted out once headed nearing upper stretch, then was taken up while quickly giving way between
foes racing into the lane.

SITTING PRETTY, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, angled inwards to track off the leaders between foes under rating, shifted out to bid
three deep between foes nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. CECI'SAPRILHOTTIE tracked off the first flight inside foes racing to the far

narrow advantage to the far turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. THREE COINS, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight three wide racing to the

GINGERONMYMIND was settled outside rivals in the second flight dropping well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, commenced a steady, three wide
advance in tandem with QUEEN TIGER to challenge the pacesetter racing through the far turn, took over racing into upper stretch and widened her margin
to the end under firm hand urging. QUEEN TIGER was urged to a forward placing tracking just off the leader racing to the first turn, conceded some position
to that foe on the backstretch, continued with a steady advance to bid for command between rivals in tandem with the winner midway through the far turn
but proved no match for that foe while just prevailing for the place honors. BRYCENS GOLD tracked the leaders from out of striking distance between foes
in second flight racing to the far turn, tipped out three wide nearing the lane and continued with interest while just missing for second. MA COCO, off last,
was settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch and lacked a closing response. BAHAMA PEARL was hustled clear along the inside, set the pace
on a commanding margin to the far turn but gave way on the far turn when completely spent midway through that bend. UPPER SPEED DS settled last
early and failed to menace. BELLE GOSSE dropped out early.

Footnotes
GOODBYE CAROLINA tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, steadily advanced on the leader to challenge for command nearing
upper stretch, was carried out midstretch but went clear late under firm handling. BARREL OF BLISS was urged to a forward placing tracking the
pacesetter, moved to press that rival a half, gained the advantage racing into the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch, drifted out racing past
midstretch and proved no match late while lasting for second. DOUBLE DOT was rated off the second flight, continued four wide through the backstretch,
then three wide into the far turn and continued with interest between rivals late to prevail for a share while missing for second. SUMMER HELPER angled to
the inside early while dropping well off the leaders, was prompted to advance along the rail after a half, tipped out on the far turn to split foes racing into
upper stretch but was outkicked for a share. REAL WILD SOLUTION was rated along the inside behind the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but
had no closing bid. LADY WOOD tracked just off the pacesetter along the inside racing to the backstretch and faded early. SHES A THREAT broke
awkwardly momentarily dislodging her rider from his irons and never gained contention. C'EST PARTI switched outside rivals racing to the first turn to make
brief pursuit of the leaders three wide on the backstretch but emptied out racing into the far turn. IMAHONKYTONKGIRL was urged along the inside setting
the pace to the backstretch, dueled for command after half into the far turn and soon gave way. CUPIDS DREAM threw her head while rearing, then ducking
inwards at the start, dislodging her rider, but walked off the course under her own power after being collected by the outrider after the race. FOLLOWING
THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
AWESOME ANYWHERE sped clear a bit off the inside racing through the backstretch, dictated the pace in hand on a comfortable margin to upper stretch,
then responded when roused through the stretch to hold the late challenge of AIN'T WASTING TIME to the end under firm handling. The latter, forwardly
placed stalking the pacesetter through the backstretch, tipped to the three path racing into the stretch and continued with a steady effort to close the gap
while failing to gain even terms with the winner. JUPITER BLUES was settled outside foes in the last flight on the backstretch, was prompted to advance in
the four path leaving the turn but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. MAGICAL TALE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight
racing to the turn, angled inside entering the stretch but offered no rally. FOX ROX made a brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes on the backstretch but
faded early. LOUD N PROUD settled inside foes in the last flight on the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. BLACK V. K. proved no factor.

Footnotes
HARROW, caught four wide racing through the chute, angled inwards racing to the backstretch prompting a rival's pace, moved to press the issue entering
the far turn, gained the advantage leaving the furlong marker, shifted out in late stages while being roused to turn back a challenge from DOUBLE DEMON
and just lasted under brisk handling. VAN was settled outside foes behind the second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide, then five
wide into upper stretch but continued with solid late momentum to edge a rival for the place honors on the wire. DOUBLE DEMON angled inside early to
track behind the second flight, steadily gained position along the rail racing into the far turn, shifted out three wide entering the lane while being urged to
close the gap on the pacesetter in late stages but was carried out by that rival while losing second late. BARAHIN tracked off the first flight between foes
racing to the backstretch, angled inwards entering the stretch and continued with interest while being outkicked for a share. CHINA BEACH, reserved along
the inside in the opening half, made steady progress along the rail nearing the far turn, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch but continued evenly late.
HARPOON HARRY was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command on the far turn into upper stretch and gave
way late. BOCA settled between foes racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. REINER, caught five wide racing through the chute, tracked
the leaders outside foes in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. BROTHER BRAD tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight, tipped
out after a half and emptied out racing into the far turn. MAGICAL ADVENTURE proved no factor. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN AND DISQUALIFIED HARROW FOR INTERFERENCE, PLACING HIM THIRD.
