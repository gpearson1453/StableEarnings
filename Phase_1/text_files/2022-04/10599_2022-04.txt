Footnotes
DRILL'S VALENTINE broke readily, was urged prompting the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and
widened her margin late under firm encouragement. LANGUE LIEE broke inwards bumping ME SAY SO, was urged along three wide pursuing the leaders
into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but continued grudgingly to edge a rival for the place honors. ROYAL ATHENA, urged disputing the pace
inside the eventual winner through the backstretch into the turn, pressed the issue inside that foe into upper stretch but weakened in late stages. ME SAY
SO, bumped, then shuffled back out of tight quarters at the start, settled into stride, shifted out four wide in upper stretch but offered no rally. LLOYDLY was
rated between foes tracking just off the leaders in early stages, angled to the inside on the turn and gave way into the lane.

Footnotes
HARD TEN, in touch three deep prompting the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue in that path on the far turn into upper stretch and narrowly
prevailed under brisk handling in a prolonged drive. AYCAPOTE broke readily, dictated the pace between foes on a narrow advantage to the backstretch,
grudgingly resisted the winner's bid remaining a bit off the rail grudgingly to the end but just failed to contain that rival. SNAP HOOK settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and found his best stride late to edge a rival for a share. STRONG ENDING, in touch
with the leaders four wide racing to the first turn, eased off those rivals to track the leaders to the second bend, was urged to lodge a brief bid in the four
path nearing upper stretch but flattened out in the drive. FUEGO CALIENTE settled last early and failed to menace. I KICKN, urged inside foes prompting
the pace a bit off the rail into the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. IT'S FATE angled to the rail early tracking just off the first flight, made some
brief progress after a half to gain striking distance inside foes but emptied out nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
RAINOUT angled inwards to track just off the pacesetter between foes to the backstretch, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a
steady late response to wrest the advantage and just hold HURRY UP DEAR to the end under firm handling. The latter tracked just off the pacesetter along
the rail from the outset to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, bid for command along the rail when presented an opening midstretch and continued
willingly to contest the issue to the wire. SYLLABUS tracked off the second flight between foes to the backstretch, shifted four wide racing into the stretch
and continued with a mild bid while gaining a share. SHES SKY HIGH was urged setting the pace while angling to the inside leaving the chute, turned back
a rival's challenge while tipping off the inside in upper stretch and yielded to the top trio late. DIALING VALENTINE switched out three wide racing to the first
turn, was prompted to advance with an early move on the backstretch prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, then gave way in the drive.
MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL was settled last, switched outside rivals entering the backstretch, continued four wide to the stretch and gained some position late
while making no impact. DREAM TRACER broke outwards bumping BAROLA, was switched outside foes early while being prompted to contend and
emptied out racing into the far turn. WHAT A KNOCKOUT settled along the inside early and failed to menace. BAROLA, bumped at the start, was settled
between foes and proved no threat. MATCHA angled to the inside early tracking just off the pacesetter to the backstretch but retreated early.

Footnotes
GIOVANE'S PROMISE, brushed by THE EQUINEST at the start, moved to the fore inside foes, pulling against light rating into the backstretch, dictated
terms on a narrow advantage to the far turn, then drove clear racing through the stretch under firm right handed pressure. PLUNK, forwardly placed three
wide in the opening stages, eased off the leaders to track those foes outside a rival on the backstretch, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch, shifted
inwards a bit under pressure and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. POSEIDONS MYTH tracked just off the leaders along the
inside to the backstretch, tipped out to the three path leaving the midway point of the far turn, angled inwards entering the stretch to gain position between
foes but was outkicked for second. AGENT MULGANNON was urged prompting the pace between foes, then outside the eventual winner racing to the
backstretch, pressed the issue to the far turn, drifted out racing into upper stretch and quickly gave way. OSABA settled outside foes racing to the
backstretch, failed to menace. THE EQUINEST popped through the gate just before the start brushing the eventual winner, switched outside foes racing to
the backstretch and came up empty on the far turn.

Footnotes
VITALE pulled his way to the lead while angling to the inside leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a narrow margin under light rating to the far turn, turned
back a challenge from SHINBORO nearing upper stretch, then drew clear through the stretch under firm left handed encouragement. SHINBORO tipped just
off the inside tracking outside the pacesetter under light rating racing to the backstretch, bid for command nearing upper stretch but proved no match while
holding a rival for the place honors. MELINA'S DREAM angled to the inside early tracking just off the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch and was
outkicked for second. LUDO tracked the leaders three wide to the backstretch, was urged to advance in that path racing into the far turn to lodge a brief bid
but flattened out in the drive. PANADERO was settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch but offered no rally. ROCKY
DICE angled inwards to track the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch but faded after a half. FIERCE WARRIOR was rated near
the inside early and failed to menace.

JIM'S BRONZE STAR was rated tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening stages, conceded ground to that foe in the second furlong lead the second
flight on a narrow margin outside a rival, made a steady advance leaving the midway point of the turn to close the gap on the leader in the three path racing
into upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm handling. AZURA tracked off the second flight outside rivals
in the opening stages, tipped out three wide in the stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. ROSE'S CAUSE, bumped at
the start, angled to the inside tracking the leader as part of the second flight, saved ground to the lane and was just outkicked for second. TOWERING
GAZE, shuffled a bit avoiding close quarters at the start, tracked off the second flight racing into the lane but offered no rally. JARA broke outwards bumping
ROSE'S CAUSE, was righted, then sped well clear of the field through the backstretch, held sway to upper stretch but faltered approaching the furlong
marker. PEACELOVENKARMA settled last while shifting off the inside on the backstretch, swung wide entering the stretch but proved no threat.

Footnotes
THAT'S MY BOI TOY broke readily, prompted the pace inside a rival in the opening stages, continued in attendance to the pacesetter into the turn, pressed
the issue nearing upper stretch, then edged forward in the closing stages under right handed encouragement to hold BALLYMENA on a safe advantage to
the end. The latter was rated tracking the leaders four wide in second flight on the backstretch, commenced a steady advance three deep when given his
cue nearing upper stretch, then continued willingly in that path to close the gap on the winner. SWIFT DANCER, brushed at the start, was urged forcing the
pace outside a rival to gain a narrow advantage racing to the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and yielded late. TRAVELINGBLUESMAN tracked
the leaders between foes in second flight in early stages, tipped out to three path entering the lane and made an effort to gain some position while no real
threat. NOT A DANCE ducked inwards at the start losing position, switched outside a drifting rival on the backstretch to race outside foes to the lane but
offered no rally. CAJUN RED broke slowly, was hustled to gain a position inside rivals in second flight racing to the turn, then gave way into the lane.
DAVID'S CUPID tracked the leaders three wide between foes on the backstretch, then steadily faded into upper stretch. JAQUE MATE COCO broke
outwards brushing SWIFT DANCER and emptied out early.

Footnotes
KING RAMOS tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance under rating to the backstretch, tipped outside that foe steadily advancing nearing the
far turn, took over midway through that bend, went clear into upper stretch and widened the margin late under firm left handed encouragement. SWIFT KID,
reserved along the inside in the opening stages, advanced along the rail when presented an opening on the backstretch to gain a position just off the
leaders entering the far turn, tipped outside a tiring rivals racing into upper stretch and edged second between foes. MAGICAL ADVENTURE tracked off the
second flight outside foes, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to improve position. CAPE HEDGE was rated off the second
flight between foes to the backstretch, switched outside foes on the far turn, was fanned five wide racing through the lane but continued to gain position. ICY
STORM tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, then between foes into the backstretch, shifted out to make brief pursuit three wide racing
into the far turn but soon flattened out. BAM BAM WARRIOR angled to the inside early, saved ground to the lane but had no closing bid. HELLFIRE BOB
reserved near the inside, then between foes into the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn but made no real impression. AGRIPINO sprinted clear of the
field along the inside, held sway to the far turn, continued in pursuit of the winner into the stretch but gave way in late stages. ROWDY JESS, reserved in
last to the backstretch, failed to menace. CLEAR TO CLOSE, caught wide early, soon dropped out.

Footnotes
KATIES A LADY broke sharply, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the inside while pulling a bit to the backstretch, held sway on a safe margin past
midstretch and prevailed under pressure. LATIN NIKKITA was rated just off the second flight along the inside, was prompted to advance along the rail into
the far turn, switched outside rivals racing into upper stretch and continued three deep in late stages to edge a rival for the place honors. HIGH VIBES
angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, tipped to the two path racing into the far turn, was roused to close the gap on the winner racing through
the stretch but was outkicked for second. WASSER, reserved off the second flight to the backstretch, was fanned five wide racing through the stretch but
continued with an effort to improve position. I'M BUZZY, forwardly placed outside a rival tracking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, was urged to
lodge a brief bid in the three path nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. NOVELERA, fractious in the gate as the field loaded, was settled
along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but lacked the needed late bid. SHE NASTY settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and
failed to menace thereafter. SHESASCOLDASICE settled along the inside in early stages, switched out entering the backstretch and never proved a serious
threat. MINING CHROME tracked off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, came under pressure after a half and quickly faded. WATER
WITCH soon trailed.
