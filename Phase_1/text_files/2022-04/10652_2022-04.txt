Footnotes
GRAVES MILL ROAD moved up between horses to show the way up the backstretch off the inside, shook clear late in the turn while remaining in the two
path, kept to task past midstretch, stayed clear. VIOLENT PASS back off the pace well out in the strip, four wide through most of the turn, floated out five
wide into the lane when advancing, could do little with the winner the final furlong, remained clear for the second spot while drifting to the inside late.
APPRAISAL behind the pace in the two path, dropped to the inside midway on the turn, continued toward the rail past the furlong marker, altered course
late when the runner up drifted to the rail, remained one paced final strides. FUNANDFUNNY forwardly placed outside, floated out four wide turning for
home, went one paced to the wire. BOLD MINISTER broke back, saved ground to no avail to also be going along evenly through the lane. BRODY
BOUCHER failed to menace while racing off the inside. BITCOIN BANKER last to leave, raced three wide through the turn while still trailing, made no
impact through the lane. OUTCOME broke out but alertly, dueled early inside the winner, began a steady fade before a half, came out into the lane floating
out outer rivals.

Footnotes
MAX'S HEART broke with the leaders, contested the pace while between rivals, remained between horses into the lane, well clear a furlong out while under
pressure, held the runner up comfortably safe late. RISKY SITUATION behind the leaders early out in the strip, closer in some traffic late in the turn, came
between foes into the lane, stalled a furlong out, coming again late, well clear for the place. MORE THAN HAMAZING lacked speed, raced to to three wide
turn, modest late interest to be along and then clear for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. OTHER TIMES off a step slow, raced back early, came
six wide out of the turn, improved position down the middle of the strip with some modest late interest. KISSOFTHENILE reluctant to load, broke well, raced
with the pace up the backstretch, vied four wide into the lane, remained with the pace in the three path turning for home, tired in the run to the wire.
TAPPED OUT in mid pack along the inside, in tight, steadied along the rail late in the turn, continued to save ground into the lane, improved a bit through
upper stretch then flattened out. CYBERTOWN broke back, lacked speed, four wide into the lane, improved slightly, no real threat. PERIPATETIC flashed
speed along the inside for four furlongs and gave way. BOSTON WALLY made little impact while racing three wide. YOUNG O' DAINE broke sharp, helped
set the early pace three wide and between horses, gave way then got out late in the turn, continued to back up through the stretch. CONCOCTION
forwardly placed between horses up the backstretch, shuffled back into the turn, continued to fade through the lane. ROYAL D D hesitated at the start,
trailed far back throughout.

REEF'S DESTINY behind the early pace toward the inside, lacked clear room in traffic into and through much of upper stretch, dropped inside approaching
midstretch, challenged soon after, drew clear under steady handling. LEO DEL REO bothered when in tight at the start, raced well back early as a result,
was four out to five wide late in the turn, finished willingly to earn the place, not a threat to the winner. FIVE O ONE broke out to help tighten up outer rivals,
lacked speed, saved ground into the lane, improved proved position, outkicked for the place position. RUBIGINOUS with the pace while along the inside,
continued to vie through the turn, two path for the drive, weakened. C H JAY in tight at the start to be slow away, lacked speed into the turn, came in the two
path for the drive, improved position without posing a serious threat. MY DOMINATOR in mid pack early, moved closer while five wide into the lane,
prominent past the furlong marker then flattened out in the run to the wire. MARVELOUS THUNDER broke in, was straightened for contest the issue early
three wide, remained forward and in the three path turn, gave way in the drive. TROPHY DADDY pinched back at the break to be slow away, continued to
trail for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. RUSTY CAGE sprinted clear before a quarter, held a slight advantage late in the turn
then gave way readily in the drive. FUNNY ACTOR in the second flight three wide, stopped in the turn, well back, jogged in.

SOUTHERN GRAYCE showed the way up the backstretch inside, continued to hold a slight advantage through the turn, two path into the lane, edged away
under firm handling. JOY'S ROCKET behind the winner in the second flight, continued to follow that one into the lane, roused, finished willingly to be clear
for the place while unable to make much progress on the winner. JOYFUL CADENCE prompted the pace from between horses early, moved out and moved
closer three wide late in the turn, lacked a further advance to the wire. PERFECT HAPPINESS dueled up front outside the winner early, gave way from
between horses exiting the turn. HEADLAND off a step slow, went evenly in the two path. SOMEONE SAID SO was finished early while four wide out of the
turn.

Footnotes
MACHO RONNIE with the early pace while wide and in hand, dueled early to mid turn, shook clear late in the bend, drew out steadily through the lane while
attempting to drift in, kept to pressure with a firm left handed crop. HIGHTAIL COWBOY narrowly set the pace while dueling inside the winner into the turn,
proved no match for that one in the drive, edged clear for the place. DIESEL FUEL in mid pack early while outside, four wide through the turn when staging
a mild rally, flattened out a bit the final furlong, saved the show. CYBER MONDAY bumped early, well wide into the turn, came six wide into the lane when
advancing, gaining for the show down the middle of the strip. CATS GOTTA CHANCE in the second flight while in the two path, continued one paced
through the lane in lacking a closing punch. MO VODKA off a step slow, trailed far back for a half, steered out four wide turning for home, improved position
down the middle of the strip while too late. HARDSCRABBLE broke alertly, pressed the issue up the backstretch, came three wide for the drive, had little lef
tfor the stretch run. SERENDIP RULER came in, bumped CYBER MONDAY early, void of speed, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been
decided. UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP forwardly placed for a half three wide, gave way in some traffic exiting the turn. MY KINDA TETON saved ground to no
avail. ROYAL DE BE lacked speed inside, continued to save ground turn, never involved. HEART HEADED ARKY in mid pack early, staged a steady retreat
while three wide.

Footnotes
TIZ RYE TIME in a bit tight at the start, raced in the second flight outside, challenged three wide and outside midway on the second turn, vied into the lane,
put a head in front nearing the furlong marker, edging clear late under firm handling. TOMA TODO broke in, was righted to contest the pace off the inside,
dueled the middle half, responded when the winner challenged in the second turn when between foes, long drive, proved stubborn to the end. LEADING
WEST in the second flight inside, tracked the pace in the two path into the far turn, moved out a bit and followed the winner in the three path into the stretch,
staged a mild rally to prove best of the rest while getting to the runner up late. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK lacked speed while racing off the inside, four wide
late in the final turn, went flat through the lane in lacking a late kick. EKATI'S VERVE dueled up front closest to the inside, weakened in the drive.
CENTURION off a step slow, remained back in failing to rally. UNIDENTIFIED MAN off a step slow, four wide when continuing to trail into the far turn,
stopped soon after, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
SPEED BIAS lacked early foot while four wide through the first turn, continued outside and was four wide into the far turn when beginning to advance, came
three wide into the lane, lugged in when lodging a late bid, lugged in twice to bother RIDER'S SPECIAL under a steady right handed crop, narrowly
outfinished that one at the wire. RIDER'S SPECIAL forwardly paced first turn while saving ground, continued within striking distance up the backstretch, took
over in the two path midway on the final turn, clear into the lane, came out a bit with less than a furlong to go then was bothered twice by SPEED BIAS in
deep stretch, nipped by that one in the final strides. MAGNIFICUS off a step slow, remained back for six furlongs, rallied in the four path out of the final turn,
challenged outside the top two late, not enough. RED DEVIL settled off the pace toward the inside, three wide exiting the final turn, mild rally to improve
position, not a threat to the top three. PINCH HITTER in the second flight while off the rail, raced three wide through the second turn and had little left.
PORTSMOUTH four wide through both turns, never menaced. WILDWOOD Z stumbled at the start, quickly moved up to be well clear before a quarter,
showed the way up the backstretch, faltered when headed by RIDER''S SPECIAL in the final turn. BLAME ELI off a step slow, remained always back.
PUDGE BOY PALACE in the second flight early, stopped far turn out in the strip, distanced stretch, jogged in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE JOCKEY OF RIDER'S SPECIAL AGAINST SPEED BIAS FOR
INTERFERENCE IN THE LATE GOING, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S TOWER never far back off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, brushed with the runner up repeatedly, challenged while widest of the first
flight past the furlong marker, long drive, proved narrowly best in game fashion. ROLLING FORK also forwardly placed from the start, in some traffic along
the inside into the turn, eased out a bit raced inside the winner into the lane, brushed with that foe several times in the run to the wire, narrowly missed.
RIBBONS AND MEDALS away in good order, vied up front outside, dueled late turn, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker, gave ground
grudgingly to the top pair while inside them at the wire. DERBY DATE void of speed, raced four out to five wide out of the turn, finished with some late
energy while too late for the top three. DEFLATER within striking distance, raced three wide through the turn, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch.
CUMBERLAND AVENUE in mid pack while racing inside early, came three wide turning for home, improved slightly while not a serious threat. HERD
IMMUNITY off a step slow, lacked speed, raced three wide through the turn, never dangerous. REED KAN set or forced the pace for a half closest to the
inside, gave way in the drive. WRONGWAYHIGHWAY fell back to trail after the start, never a factor while picking off a couple of tiring rivals late. JOE
FRAZIER in mid pack and three wide, four wide turning for home, backed up. STORM ADVISORY gave while four wide before a half, eased up stretch to be
distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
WHELEN SPRINGS away in good order, prompted the issue into the turn, moved closer to challenge late in the bend from the outside, fell back off the
leader while drifting out slightly in upper stretch, vigorously roused nearing the furlong marker, lodged a second bid late again from the outside, dug in to find
more, up in the final strides in a game effort. COGBURN bit washy, broke sharp, cleared early to show the way up the backstretch and into the turn,
responded when challenged by the winner turning for home, edged away a bit a furlong out, nailed late by that same rival, far clear of the others. CAIRAMA
last away, moved up settled in mid pack while off the inside, three wide through the turn, moved a bit closer turning for home, proved no match for the top
two, clear of the others. AIN'T LIFE GRAND went one paced in the two path, lacked kick through the lane. MOWINS forwardly placed early in the second
flight inside, weakened. UNIFIED REPORT fell back to trail after the start, drifted out stretch.

Footnotes
BETTYS CASH broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, clear in the two path through the turn, larger lead midstretch, held the runner up safe late
under steady handling. ALLO ENRY pressed the early pace along the inside, fell back off the winner through the turn, moved out to be three wide into the
lane, getting to that same rival late, clearly second best. SKYPED in mid pack while well wide, four out to five wide turning for home, rallied to be clear for
the show, not a threat to the top two. DUDLEY off a step slow, raced well back early three wide into the turn, angled to be five wide exiting, rallied to improve
position, no real threat. EV'S SHERMAN moved out behind the pace, four wide through the turn when one paced, continued in even fashion through the
lane to finish up evenly. TRAFFIC CONTROL in the main body after breaking with the field in the two path backstretch, dropped inside midway on the turn,
lacked a punch through the lane. MORNING DRIVE failed to menace while four out to five wide through the turn. BILLHILL forwardly placed early, steadied
in some traffic with just over a half to run, fell back then continued to gradually fade through the stretch. SECRET SURVIVOR broke back, remained back in
failing to threaten. MOONSHINE SURFER hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, was never a factor. SALTY JONES forwardly placed in
the two path for a half, stopped in the stretch, trailed home.
