Footnotes
CLOSE TO ME last to leave, behind the pace off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide midway on the final turn, narrowly showed the way into the
lane, drew clear under steady handling. SWANAGE narrowly set the early pace inside, dueled into and through the far turn, headed by the winner into the
lane, held stubbornly until late, remained clear for the place. ROAD TEST lacked speed along the inside, continued to save some ground far turn, moved out
a bit to race in the two path into the lane, bothered slightly by a fallen rival upper stretch, mild late interest to be up for the show. PERSISTO in the second
flight outside, moved up four wide with and outside the winner midway on the final turn, battled into the stretch remaining on the outside, weakened the final
furlong to lose the show. DARING fell back to trail, raced on the outside, lacked a closing response while remaining wide. DAIGLE with the early pace, fell
back after a half, was going one paced in the back of the pack turning for home, jumped over fallen foe soon after, unseated rider, walked off. MOSTLY
AWESOME with the pace three wide first turn, dueled into far turn, began to lose position between foes late in the turn, in tight, clipped heels and fell in
upper stretch, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE INCIDENT AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
STRATOFORTRESS behind the pace in the two path, came three wide when moving closer turning for home, challenged outside the leader approaching
the furlong grounds, gained command, edged away late under firm handling. STAYED IN FOR HALF closest to the leader up the backstretch, moved to
challenged between rivals midway on the bend, showed the way into the stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner late,
clearly second best. SPARTY SENSE within striking distance inside, closer while remaining along the rail late in the turn, flattened out in proving no match
for the top two in the drive, clear of the others. PRESSURE broke back, lacked speed while three wide, improved slightly while never posing a serious
threat. BEEASY last away, trailed most of the way, was never a threat. LOCK UP broke sharp, clear while rank early, got out steadily through the turn, lost
the advantage, five path into the lane, backed up.

Footnotes
CENTURION broke back, lacked speed while saving ground first turn, worked way out to be four wide turning for home, steered back in, rallied up the inside
to be in time. SUPPRESSOR broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn in the two path, remained on the engine while off the inside into
the far turn, three wide in keeping a rival parked four wide into the stretch, held that foe at bay to the wire, led late, caught. PIZZA CHARLIE in the second
flight through the first turn three wide, remained outside, four wide into the far turn, was kept in that path by the runner up exiting that bend when
challenging, saw that bid repelled, much best of others. CONTRABANDISTA settled early while saving some ground, roused when moving closer along the
inside into the far turn, flattened out in the drive. PREGAME in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide through the final turn, went flat through the
lane in lacking a closing response. WORDS OF WISDOM broke back, pressed the runner up through the first turn, moved up to duel with that one before a
half, gave way with three furlongs remaining. TAXIT stumbled badly at the break, trailed, four wide into the lane, remained back.

Footnotes
SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY broke alertly from the outside, shook off the other speed to be clear by early turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the
lane, held the runner up comfortably safe in the run to the wire while kept to task with a steady right handed crop. ROAD BIBLE forwardly placed while in the
three path, crept a bit closer late in the turn, could do little more with the winner through the lane, clear of the others. MAJOR CHANCE broke back, moved
up steadily to press the winner by late on the backstretch, fell back off that one through the turn while continuing to save ground, went evenly through the
lane to finish up best of the rest. FUNANDFUNNY in mid pack just off the inside for a half, angled four wide into the lane, improved position well wide in the
drive, gaining for the show. HARD TO PARK off a step slow, raced back and off the inside, fanned six wide when improving turning for home, not dangerous
in the late going. STUD PUPPY lacked speed in the three path, floated out five wide while between horses into the stretch, went one paced through the
stretch. FALLEN EMPIRE fell back to trail soon after the start, remained devoid of speed for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had
been decided. AFRICAN WARRIOR checked up in traffic a furlong in, remained in mid pack through the turn, backed up through the stretch. AMERICAN
CHAOS in the second flight early, staged a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
AVA'S GRACE moved up to show the way into the first turn, rated through a moderate set of early fractions, stayed clear through the lane under a steady
right handed crop. SUNNY ISLE BEACH void of speed just off the inside, moved out to be three wide early in the far turn, rallied for the place while not a
threat to the winner. TOO PRETTY with the winner early, chased that one through the middle half, also proved no match in the drive, outkicked for the
place. SUNDIAL went one paced while saving all the ground. CUPID'S MUSIC four wide into the first turn, remained outside, four wide again early in the
second, finished far back to be well beaten. TROUVILLE void of speed, continued to be outrun while three wide into the far turn, stopped to be distanced,
jogged in.

Footnotes
BUMPER POOL off a step slow, moved up to be in mid pack well off the inside into the turn, steered out four to five wide in traffic exiting the turn, finished
willingly down the middle of the strip to be in time. MAX'S HEART broke on top and outward to bother the winner a bit, allowed the early leader to go,
collared that one in the two path late bend, well clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner. RISKY SITUATION back off the early pace, dropped
toward the inside early in the turn, improved inside of several rivals turning into the stretch, proved determined for the show spot while not a threat to the top
two. UCANTMAKETHISTUFUP back off the pace outside, four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, outfinished for the show. CATS GOTTA CHANCE
forwardly placed off rail, briefly challenged three wide midway on the turn and outside the runner up, weakened. HIGHTAIL COWBOY void of speed, moved
out a bit to be four wide and in some traffic entering the stretch, lacked a closing response when clear for the drive. SERENDIP RULER devoid of speed for
a half, fanned six wide into the lane, improved by passing mostly tiring rivals, not a real threat. FETCHS BRAHM lacked speed, in some traffic while five
wide late in the turn, came four wide into the lane, had nothing for the stretch run. DIESEL FUEL void of speed, five wide into the turn, tired from those early
efforts. HEART HEADED ARKY in the second flight early, began a steady retreat before a half. SACRAMENT moved up inside to flash speed in showing
the way early, stopped when headed by the runner up in the turn. MO VODKA within striking distance early outside, four wide turn, also gave way.

Footnotes
BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN allowed the pace to go early while off the inside, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, advanced and challenged three
wide midway on the final turn, took over into the stretch, kicked clear under steady handling. VENTURE FORTH allowed the pace to go early, four wide into
the first turn, again late in the second bend when beginning to advance, finished willingly to be well clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner
while out in the middle of the strip. GO FOR SHERRIE set or forced the pace along the inside, for over a mile and then weakened when the real running
began at the head of the lane. BEAR OAK set or forced the issue up front in the two path, weakened in the run down the stretch. PEPPER PIKE remained
back in failing to menace. FLATOUT WINNER last to leave, lacked speed, five wide into the lane, came up empty for the drive.

Footnotes
GUANA CAY broke alertly, settled behind the early leaders toward the inside, closer late backstretch, idled along into the far turn, asked, steered three wide
to advance late in that final bend, collared the leader from the outside with a furlong to run, wore that foe down to be edging clear late. TAP FOR ME
forwardly placed from the start off the inside, advanced and took over in the far turn, continued to show the way into the lane, gave ground grudgingly to the
winner, clear for the place. JAZZY LADY last to leave, unhurried while saving ground, continued along the inside second turn, up for the show while not a
threat to the top two. KABOOM BABY four wide into the first turn, continued outside and in mid pack, advanced four wide into the stretch, flattened out late
to be caught for the place. URSULINA away well, pace inside, weakened when headed in the second turn. WEST SIDE GIRL remained back in failing to
menace. UNBRIDLED TWISTER chased the early leader, began a steady retreat after a half. HOT SPRINGS BLING finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
DUPLICITOUS settled off the pace and the inside, began to move a bit closer three to four wide late in the second turn, asked along, roused into the lane,
outside bid a furlong out, drew clear under continued steady handling. MEGAN'S CLARA in the second flight while four wide first turn, continued to track the
middle half, ranged up to challenge three wide turning for home, vied between rivals and inside the winner past the furlong marker, could not match that one
late, held sway for the place. A REAL JEWEL broke on top, pressured the leader to that one's outside early, vied the middle half, continued to battle into the
lane, also gave ground grudgingly late, outkicked for the place spot. IPSUM GRATUS within striking distance inside, two path into the lane, lugged out
stretch, even finish. MY DAMS ATITUDE off a step slow, settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the final turn, finished up flat late in also
lacking a late kick. RIGHT TRAPPE void of speed while well wide into the first turn, five wide again late in the final bend, improved slightly while not posing a
serious threat. LEGENDARY GIFT moved up to show the way through the first turn in the two path, vied backstretch, weakened when headed final bend.
DUCHESS BUBBLES five wide into the first turn, tucked in a bit, three wide second turn, tight, steadied from between foes midway on that bend, fell back.
MOHAYLADY void of speed while toward the inside, continued two path second turn, never a threat. FIFTH RISK off step slow, was finished after a half.
