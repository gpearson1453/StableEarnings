Footnotes
AIR FORCE WOMAN was hustled in the opening stages to dispute the pace, took command into the turn, extended the lead under a hand ride into the
stretch and won as much the best. CLOSED CIRCUIT was a bit slow into stride early on, chased the fast pace from a ground saving path through the turn,
was no match for the winner in the stretch but was best of the rest in the final stages. LADY SKYWALKER broke alertly, chased the pace three wide on the
turn, tired in the late going but was well clear of the rest for third. LUCKY LARA chased the pace outside of rivals on the turn and weakened in the drive.
TRIBUTE TO JAZZ pressed the speed from AIR FORCE WOMAN into the turn and gave out.

Footnotes
BLUSHING BAY attended to the slow early fractions, was roused in upper stretch, reeled in FANTASTIC SECRET approaching the sixteenth marker and
edged clear in the final stages. FANTASTIC SECRET was hustled leaving the break, set pedestrian fractions through the opening half, extended the lead on
the second turn, came under pressure from the winner leaving the furlong grounds and could not hold BLUSHING BAY off in the end but was best of the
rest. BRITE TAN was under a snug hold while just off of the early pace, saved ground along the far turn and finished evenly in the drive, while clear of the
rest for third. FIRE DIAMONDS was unhurried early on, saved ground into the second turn and lacked a late rally. OYSTER SHOOTER settled off of the
early pace, steered three wide on the second turn and was not a factor.

KIND BUT SHE LIES tracked the early pace from a three wide path, overhauled the pacesetter leaving the turn and pulled away in the final furlong. KID IN
THE FOREST lacked early speed, was steered outside of foes on the turn, closed in the drive and was best of the rest. ROSARITA CARMELITA hopped at
the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace two wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. UNBRIDLE THE
WILD broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, was prompted through the turn by the winner, could not hold that one off in upper stretch and gave way in
the late going.

TROJAN CLUBHOUSE broke alertly and was sent to set slow fractions, extended the lead along the second turn, was kept to steady urging through the
stretch, was all out in the final stages and gamely held on to prevail in a blanket finish. MISTY CAT settled just off of the pace while saving all of the ground,
tipped out at the head of the lane, made a steady advance through the stretch run and just missed for the win in the final strides while holding for second
over an oncoming rival. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was unhurried early on, was roused two wide on the second turn, angled out at the head of the lane, made a
good late rally and just missed for the win and place while winning the nod for third. SCHERZO (GB) settled just off of the early pace, was roused three wide
leaving the second turn, vied between rivals while on the left lead in the final stages and was outfinished in the end, while just missing for the win and the
minor awards. MIDNIGHT FLOWER attended to the early pace, lost ground on the second turn and gave way in the drive. REIWA was allowed to settle off
of the early pace, saved ground through the second turn and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY MUFFIN broke sharply, was sent to the front and set moderate fractions through the second turn, was confronted nearing the furlong marker,
was all out in the late stages and gamely dug in to prevail. FILLY PELLI saved ground while stalking the pace, made a steady bid on the second turn and
into upper stretch, confronted the winner nearing the furlong marker, could not get by the game winner in the final sixteenth and was denied for the win,
while holding for the place. FLIPLIT tracked the early moderate pace, was three wide between rivals on the second turn, was able to close ground a bit in
the final stages but was outfinished in the end, while just missing for second and clear of the rest for third. MOONSHINE CAT was three wide on the first
turn while tracking the early pace, swung four deep for the run on the second turn, lost position in upper stretch and was outkicked in the late going.
COUNCILWOMAN JILLY was four wide on the first turn, settled off of the pace through the backstretch run, was steered three wide on the second turn and
did not mount a late rally. CHELINA was away a step slowly, was unhurried early on, saved ground into the second turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
AMERICA GREAT was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions while being well handled through the second turn, turned away the bid of
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS leaving the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and held safely in the end. BERNALINHO saved ground while just off
of the early pace, advanced three wide on the second turn, gained on the winner in the stretch run but could not reel him in in the end and was best of the
rest. BLOOD RED MOON was unhurried early on, was roused five wide leaving the second turn, rallied in the drive and got up for third in the final strides.
CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS broke alertly, took back to stalk the moderate pace, advanced on the winner nearing the quarter-marker, was turned away in that
effort and lost ground in upper stretch, tired in the late going and was just edged out for third. RAILSPLITTER was a bit fractious in the gate and was away a
step slowly, settled off of the pace while saving ground throughout and lacked a late rally. SUGAR BEETS settled just off of the early pace, advanced on the
backstretch run, continued that run four wide on the second turn and gave way in the late stages.

PROOF OF JAZZ was sent leaving the break, set quick fractions while being prompted into the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and held
safely in the end. GRIGORO was forwardly placed while sitting off of the top early pair, advanced three wide on the second turn, closed in the drive and
could not reel in the winner but was clear of the rest for second. FABRIANA saved ground while settling off of the early pace, was roused three wide on the
second turn, made a good late rally and was up in the final strides to secure the show. LORETTA settled off of the early pace, saved all of the ground into
the second turn, steadied off of heels entering the stretch run and lacked a late kick in the final stages. AWESOME AMANDA was hustled leaving the break
and prompted the quick pace, could not match strides with the winner leaving the second turn and weakened in the drive. CECILE'S CHAPTER settled off of
the pace while saving ground, advanced on the second turn three wide, was floated four wide into upper stretch and improved in the late stages. MISS
EVER READY saved ground while settling toward the rear of the field, advanced in upper stretch but lacked the needed late response. BLUEGRASS SKY
settled off of the early pace while in the second flight, lost position along the second turn, swung widest into the drive and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
STALKING SHADOW saved ground in the early stages while stalking the pace, was roused three deep nearing the quarter-marker, was set down for the
drive and determinedly responded to the rider's urging in the final sixteenth to prevail. ROCKTILLYOUDROP saved ground while settling off of the pace,
loomed on the second turn while two wide, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, took command into the final stages and was caught in the final
strides by the winner, while clear of the rest for second. GOVENOR'S PARTY was a bit hard to place into the first turn, was never far back in the early
running, lost ground four wide on the second turn, re-rallied in mid-stretch and could not reel in the top two but held safely for third. ROCKS AND SALT was
content to settle in the early going, saved ground through the second turn, was roused leaving the far turn, angled out approaching the eighth-pole and
closed willingly in the late stages. GALLANT WARREN saved ground while settling off of the pace, gained ground in upper stretch and continued that late
run through the final sixteenth. AUTISMS WORLD was sent leaving the break and set prompted fractions into the second turn, turned away the bid from
DESCARTES nearing the quarter pole, could not hold off the runner-up leaving the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. WINE AND WHISKY
was four wide on the first turn while off of the pace, maintained that four wide trip into the second turn, swung widest into the drive and gained ground in the
late stages. SHOT OF A LIFETIME settled off of the early pace, gained ground leaving the second turn and lacked a final kick in the stretch run.
DESCARTES was hustled early on and prompted the pace, edged up to AUTISMS WORLD nearing the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. SACRED RIDER stalked the early pace, was four wide into the backstretch run, lost ground three deep on the far turn and
faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
SKY MAKER was two wide between foes on the first turn while stalking the pace, tracked SHE'S SO SHINY through the second turn, made a steady gain
on that rival through the lane and made a final late push to earn the nod for the win. SHE'S SO SHINY broke alertly and was sent to set the early pace, was
well rated through the second turn while on a clear lead, was confronted by SKY MAKER inside of the sixteenth marker, battled against that foe's bid while
all out but was nipped on the line for the win, while clear of the rest. SACRED BEAUTY saved ground while stalking the early pace, could not match strides
with the top pair in upper stretch, was able to close a bit in the end but was outfinished, while just holding for third. BLUEBERRY EYES was four wide while
off of the early pace on the first turn, mounted a three wide rally leaving the far turn and continued that run in the final stages, just missing for third.
DASHING DEMI bumped with ALISO BEACH at the start, saved ground while settling off of the early pace, advanced in upper stretch and improved in the
late stages. REMEMBER SUE was unhurried in the early going, gained ground three wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch. CHULA
GIRL saved ground while just off of the early pace, lost ground two wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. ALISO BEACH made contact with
DASHING DEMI at the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle through the early stages, saved ground through the second turn and was not a
factor. GOLD RUSH GAL was forwardly placed in the early stages, lost ground four wide on the second turn and gave out in the drive.

Footnotes
DUMB LUCK broke alertly and was sent under firm hand urging to set the pace, carved out fast fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper
stretch and was kept to task in the end while holding safely over the oncoming runner-up. REFI NOW chased the early pace, was roused five wide into the
stretch run, closed with good interest and was not able to reel in the winner but was best of the rest. AMANOFMYSTATURE stalked the fast early pace two
wide, lost ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while just holding on for third. TIME IS GONE stalked the early pace, steadied
off of heels in tight quarters nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, was able to close in the final stages but was outkicked in the end, while
just missing for third. BOURBONWITHATWIST tracked the fast pace three deep on the turn and lacked a final kick in the stretch. LOVER BOY TOM was
void of early speed, was two wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally. PIVOTAL FEVER chased the fast pace four wide on the turn and tired in the
drive. PRINCE CINDERELLA lacked early speed and was not a factor. CIRCLE BACK was hustled leaving the start, contested the early pace to the turn,
lost position nearing the quarter pole and gave out in the final stages.
