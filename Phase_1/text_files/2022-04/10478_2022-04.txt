Footnotes
EL PECADO stalked the pace in the three path around the first turn, moved up to take a short lead midway down the backstretch, set the pace two wide
from there to midstretch, continued on the left lead and drew off under a drive. HENRYTHETHIRD raced well back three wide for six furlongs and rallied
outside to gain the place in deep stretch. CAPTURE MI set the pace along the rail around the first turn, pressed the winner from the rail down the
backstretch and around the far turn, could not keep pace from the eighth pole and lost second late. SQUEEZE ME MIKE chased the pace two and three
wide and was one-paced in the lane. GLORY AND VICTORY steadied nearing the first turn, raced off the pace three wide around that bend and four wide
around the far turn, made some progress in upper stretch but flattened out late. WARN raced off the pace two and three wide, angled in nearing the eighth
pole and lacked the needed rally. REGIO lunged at the start, had some speed inside and faded around the far turn. SUMMER ASH saved ground off the
pace, steadied in upper stretch and never threatened. NATHANIEL'S HOPE chased the pace two and three wide and retreated through the lane. TWELVE
O'CLOCK was pinched back at the start, raced four wide around the first turn, went two wide around the far turn and played no factor. THIS RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
KARATBARS broke in bumping BAHAMIAN BEAUTY at the start, hustled up to grab the early lead, showed the way widening inside around the turn, and
was kept to steady pressure. BAHAMIAN BEAUTY received a bump from KARATBARS at the start, moved off the inside chasing the latter coming off the
turn, but could not seriously menace while clearly second best. TWENTY ONE SHORT raced two to three wide on the turn, and lacked a rally staying on her
left lead. K COTTEE faded steadily two to three wide. VANISHING FAITH was outsprinted early despite hustling tactics, and remained outrun. EVIL OF
COURSE showed little three wide.

CHITIENNE set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. ADIOS BABE chased the winner in the three path in the clear, could not gain on
that foe and held well enough for the place. DUDESFIRSTDARLING broke in and bumped BE THE ONE at the start, saved ground off the pace and rallied
along the rail for the show. BE THE ONE was bumped on both sides and pinched back at the start, raced well back two wide between foes, angled out in
upper stretch and had a mild rally outside. LEMONADE LADY broke outwardly and bumped BE THE ONE at the start, chased the pace in the three path
and faded in the lane. TIZMET was outrun outside.

Footnotes
STARSHIP NANA advanced after six furlongs in the four-path, rallied steadily through the lane and was along in time outside rivals. KATIESDREAMGIRL
pressed CHARLOTTE THE BRIT from outside, poked a head in front late on the far turn just as the rider dropped the crop, stayed on willingly between
horses through the stretch under a hand drive but was outfinished. CHARLOTTE THE BRIT set the pace inside, lost the advantage soon after completing
six furlongs, then stayed on with good courage inside the top two to salvage third. FEETS OF FEATHER raced two to three wide through an even effort.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN saved ground throughout, and lacked the needed response. FORBIDDEN DREAM saved ground to no avail. TIZ ENOUGH showed
little two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SWEET ACTRESS settled off in range while racing two wide, was content to drop further back as others made middle moves down the backstretch,
advanced four wide around the far turn, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. I LOVE MAGEL vied two wide around the first turn, vied
inside of BRAIN TRUST down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the far turn, kicked clear nearing the lane, led past the eighth pole, could
not resist the winner from there but stayed on to be a clear second. WI FI vied inside of I LOE MAGEL around the first turn, settled back into a stalked
position early on the backstretch, continued to save ground in range around the far turn and churned on through the lane to hold third. KATZ THAT GAL
raced off the pace three wide, went five wide around the far turn and ran on for a minor share. PRESENCIA was off slow, saved ground off the early pace,
went four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. UNMARKED MONEY saved ground in midpack, went three wide around the far turn and
never threatened. RIVERCREST ROAD was bumped at the start then again nearing the first turn, stalked the pace three wide, bid four wide into the far turn
but came up empty in the lane. SHE IS ROYALTY was off slow, saved ground early, raced three wide around the far turn and never factored. VARSITY
KICKLINE (IRE) was bumped at the start, made little impact while racing two wide and was vanned off. FUNNY FACE was bumped twice early, raced three
wide and was through early. BLAME THE MEDIA was bumped at the start, had speed four wide and stopped nearing the lane. BRAIN TRUST rushed up
five wide around the first turn, dueled outside down the backstretch and stopped midway around the far turn.

Footnotes
BIRDMAN RICHIE was unhurried early, took closer order around the far turn three wide, rallied to overhaul HIGH PRESS from outside in midstretch and
edged clear. RYE SENSE OF HUMOR saved ground well back early, began moving around the far turn four wide, and finished well to be clearly second
best. MY MAN FLINT was bumped between horses at the start, raced well back for six furlongs, moved out approaching the stretch and rallied mildly to best
the others. HIGH PRESS vied outside ETERNAL REST through the opening half-mile, drew clear on the far turn, moved inside for the drive and gave way
with a furlong remaining. BE LIKE CLINT broke in bumping MY MAN FLINT into LINGUINI, raced four wide early, and posed no threat. STAR SHOPPING
eyed the dueling leaders up the backstretch, but came up empty after six furlongs. LINGUINI bumped with MY MAN FLINT at the start, and was through
early. MEAN MACHINE was well placed tracking the duel up the backstretch, but was finished before reaching the stretch. ETERNAL REST contested the

GANGLY settled off the pace inside, angled five wide near the quarter pole, bid between foes, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under a
drive. JOE DI BAGGIO stalked the pace between foes in the three path, bid near the quarter pole, vied between foes to deep stretch and was second best
late. HERO TIGER tracked the pace four wide, bid near the quarter pole, vied between rivals to deep stretch and was outfinished. YOU'RE KILLIN ME
settled off the pace while racing four wide, shifted widest in upper stretch and could only gain slightly. HIGH YIELD KITTEN set the pace in the two path,
continued on the left lead in the lane, fought on inside of foes and yielded leaving the sixteenth pole. TOWN CLASSIC saved ground off the pace and lacked
the needed rally. AEQUOR checked early and trailed throughout. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
LUCKY PERIDOT saved ground reserved early, moved out three to four wide approaching the stretch taking closer order, rallied steadily and wore down
STOP WAR from outside. STOP WAR set the pace well off the rail, held stubbornly but could not withstand the winner late. STARSHIP NTERPRISE was
slow into stride and lagged well back for six furlongs, then finished with good energy inside the top two. TIK TOK FAMOUS (GB) raced two to three wide in
range, and lacked a solid closing bid. LOVELY LUVY broke slowly, improved mildly but never factored. SWEET SOUPER SWEET was four wide early,
attempted to come through inside STOP WAR late on the far turn but steadied back, then faded in the drive. WAR CANOE raced three to four wide, and had
no rally. LEXINATOR tired after six furlongs inside. AN OBJECTION AGAINST STOP WAR BY THE RIDER OF SWEET SOUPER SWEET FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE APPROACHING THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

DIGNIFIED hit the starting gate to get off slow, advanced along the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch and drew
off under a drive. DEL REY DOLLY was up close four wide, was floated further out turning for home and stayed on widest to gain the place. JET FORCE set
a pressured pace along the rail, was collared in upper stretch and weakened. RUBYSA pressed the pace two wide between foes, drifted out near the
quarter pole and caused LOOK UP TO HEAVEN to clip heels and weakened in the lane. STACIAS RUBY failed to menace while racing two wide. LOOK UP
TO HEAVEN prompted the pace three wide, clipped heels near the quarter pole and had no further bids. HANNITA'S EMPIRE stumbled at the start, raced
five wide and was never involved. PRESSLY'S HOPE was outrun outside. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, RUBYSA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM

three wide on the turn, and finished one-paced. AMERICAN GODDESS broke slowly, and improved late without factoring. SARA MIA was no factor two
wide. FREE DATA was never prominent. WAR STAR faded after three furlongs. LADY PETROL (GB) broke slowly and was never in contention.

Footnotes
SILENT CHAOS was bumped entering the first turn, angled into the three path soon after, advanced inside nearing the far turn, tipped two wide midway
around the far turn, engulfed the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, quickly cleared, drifted out in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. CATATUMBO
bumped the winner into DUNNIGAN entering the first turn, raced four wide in midpack, advanced four wide around the far turn, angled in when the winner
drifted out well in front of him in upper stretch and finished willingly. TRAVEL GUIDE saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and rallied for
the show. BLUTO'S CANDY raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and improved position in the lane. SIMMS chased the
pace two and three wide, lugged in in upper stretch and faded. DANLEY played no factor while racing two wide. R ADMIRAL sprinted clear, set the pace
along the rail and faltered nearing the lane. CHARMING CHARLIE saved ground in midpack, advanced inside around the far turn, was shut off in upper
stretch and not urged from there. DUNNIGAN was bumped entering the first turn, raced in range five wide for a half then retreated three wide around the far
turn. MAILBOX MONEY was fractious in the gate, broke in the air and was never involved. STREAMING TAP had early speed three wide and stopped
entering the far turn. THE RIDER OF CATATUMBO CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT
THE STEWARDS FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
