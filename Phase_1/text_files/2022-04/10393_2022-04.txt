Footnotes
STALKING rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, then dug
in under a determined drive to eke out the nod over UNDER FIRE, while the latter stalked from the three path the first turn and bid nearing the five
sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dueled gamely through the stretch but missed. GATORATER rated close inside
the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened later yards. FLASH OF DAY stalked the pace, gave chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened stride later yards. TOP HAT ARTIST raced well back off the rail and never
factored. CLASSIC TUXEDO saved ground and showed no response.

chase inside, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. FROSTY THE BULL gave chase then flattened at the rail on the turn. ASK THE

straightened away and inched clear the final strides. PONTICELLO saved early ground racing well off the pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, improved in the five path of the far turn and dug in through the stretch to take second under the wire. MIO GRACELAND took over nearing the three
quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was caught
entering the stretch but continued close to deep stretch before reluctantly ceding. SEXY CHOCOLATTE saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid
approaching the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn mostly at the rail, angled to the seven path nearing the top of the stretch and passed rivals while
lugging in. LEG UP settled off the pace inside, gave chase into the backstretch then faded at the rail on the far turn. ON A WHIM raced well back inside the
first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. SALTY J J rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. CHAMPSTER settled off the early pace in the three and four paths, gave chase nearing the three
