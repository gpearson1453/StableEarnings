Footnotes
THE LAST FEAT broke a step slowly, settled inside on or just off the rail, moved out five wide on the far turn, drove past. SPINNING RED settled mid-pack
near inside, moved out heading to the far turn, commenced a mild bid three to four wide coming out of that bend but proved no match. SMOKE STACK was
caught four then three wide on the first turn, moved in a bit to advance past a rival two wide early on the far turn then shifted to the rail, made a minor bid
inside at the top of the stretch but evened out. VINNIEBOB stalked three wide, made a mild bid turning for home but lacked the needed late kick. BACK TO
WORK was off slowly spotting the field about four lengths, raced off the inside three to four deep and failed to menace. THIRSTY ECHO dueled two wide,
weakened. NOT NOW VICTORIA bumped a rival lightly at the start, raced mostly three to four wide and was never a threat. I AM THE JUAN was lightly
bumped at the start, hustled to duel inside, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
SHAMEONNATALIE dueled outside three wide, edged away. MY INSTIGATOR dueled inside the winner but in the two path, was outkicked. SWEET
REGARDS tracked inside, was within range turning for home but needed more. KEEP IT ROLLIN swung five wide and improved position. DANIEL'S GIRL
eased back from between rivals then encouraged along to chase from outside, fanned six wide into the stretch and had no rally. ALLIE R raced outside a
rival mid-pack, went three to four wide on the turn, failed to menace. NICOLE'S TALES broke awkwardly then was encouraged forward to chase, went four
wide on the turn, flattened out. LILLY DEAREST shifted in going two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. STORMIN CHICKADEE raced off the rail and
was not a factor. CHA CHA TOUCH trailed and was not a factor.

and held safe. TRUST MANDO settled two wide early, advanced while swinging six wide leaving the far turn, was gaining too late. WAYLAY set a pressured
pace two deep, had no extra in the lane. ESTEEMED was caught five wide into the first turn, shifted in, went three wide on the far turn and rallied between
foes in the stretch. LINCOLN COUNTY KID tracked inside, failed to rally. SANTIAGO'S TOWER was in range five wide coming to the far turn, faltered and
faded. ROAD TO HEAT vied inside, switched out three deep near the three-sixteenths while weakening and had no rally. HIT A NOTE moved forward four
wide to contend for the lead briefly up the backstretch, dropped back and faded. TOX was caught four wide early, failed to threaten. SMOOTHING IRON
went three wide into the first turn, tired.

Footnotes
SIGALERT set the pace racing off the rail, faced moderate pressure up the backstretch, drew off. BARBIERE went three wide early moving forward to stalk
the leaders, swung out five wide turning for home, got up for the place. AUTOPILOT bumped a rival at the start, angled in heading to the first turn, moved up
inside briefly to force the issue, came out later, lost second. MASTERCLASS was bumped and steadied at the start, went three wide on the turns and
improved. KENTUCKY PEERLESS was up close two to three wide early, began to weaken three to four deep on the far turn and continued to do so in the
lane. SPINNING BLACK saved ground but failed to threaten. DEL ARGENT was caught five wide into the first turn, raced evenly three to four deep through
the far turn and failed to menace. CALIBOGEE was in a bit tight four wide between rivals into the first turn, continued outside four to five wide on the far turn,
was never a threat. CHATTER BAR raced three to four wide and was not a factor. EPIC ADVENTURE raced four to five wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MINISTERTOMYHEART was two wide on the first turn, moved up between rivals to force the pace at that juncture, was pressured by a foe turning for home
but remained clear and held sway while being eased up in the final yards. MR. BIG RIG drifted out three wide and bumped a rival entering the first turn, was
within contention through much of the running but proved no match. BIG EVENT was bumped into the first turn and floated four wide, tracked the leaders
shifting in at the quarter pole but failed to rally. QUINTON'S CHARMER broke a step slowly, was unhurried early while in the vicinity of a loose horse, shifted
in and raced mostly near the rail, improved position. HUNKY DUNN shifted in heading into the first turn showing brief early speed, dropped back and failed
to rally. LEA COSTA ME went four wide on the turns and failed to menace. FOUR SOCKS WHO went five wide into the first turn, steadily retreated while
remaining wide. EIGHT MAKAR bobbled at the break losing the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START AS WELL AS
AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BIG EVENT AGAINST MR. BIG RIG ALLEGING INTERFERENCE ON THE FIRST TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
