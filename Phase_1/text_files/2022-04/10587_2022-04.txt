Footnotes
PAID THE PREACHER shared the lead outside THAT KHENNY, was roused leaving the turn then moved clear while ridden out the last eighth. THAT
KHENNY contested the pace from inside, did not stay with PAID THE PREACHER when set down for the drive, angled outside that one inside the final
furlong and could only hold his position late. VIOLENZA D'ORO hustled to be forwardly placed between rivals, battled for third in the lane and narrowly kept
his position. FUTURE VISION was also sent to be close early from outside, came into the stretch from path four, fought for the show but did not have
enough late. AWESOME SKIPPY progressed from inside on the bend, gradually angled out five wide for a clear path upper stretch and was closing the gap
in the waning yards. CHARLIE'S BEACH showed little in a ground-saving trip. BLEEDING BLUE was an early factor but gave way two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
CHEEKERS broke alertly, showed the way just off the inside while in hand, was let out leaving the bend and continued to lengthen command while kept to
task in the lane. CRAPS SHOOTER in contention early, was in path four then five through the turn and caught MUNCH for second in the waning yards.
MUNCH gradually improved position from inside, moved clear for second in the lane but could not sustain his bid deep stretch. LIFE IS GRAND forwardly
placed outside CHEEKERS, weakened between rivals for the stretch run. LOW TIDE WARNING stayed in path three taking the turn and failed to menace.
FRIEND was a factor on the backstretch but faded from between rivals on the bend. LUCKYVILLE showed little in a wide trip.

Footnotes
TALIS PARK GRAD boxed in behind the leader on the backstretch, got through to vie for the lead outside CHOPPER on the turn, moved ahead into the
lane, drew clear under urging, gradually drifted out the last furlong but prevailed. AZRAEL prominent early, came into the lane just outside TALIS PARK
GRAD, took over second upper stretch then gradually closed the gap on the latter in the late going. ONE PUTT RICHIE well placed from inside, angled out
five wide upper stretch for a clear path, lacked a significant bid but gained third. W W TRAFALGAR was forwardly placed outside horses to the bend then
began to wear down. CHOPPER was hustled to a clear lead early, challenged from the outside on the turn and gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
PALACE KITTEN soon had a clear clear lead, was challenged from outside on the turn, floated out some entering the lane, battled under mostly his own
courage and kept IMPERIAL MOMENT at bay. IMPERIAL MOMENT advanced from outside, was three wide on the bend, bumped with MIND YOUR OWN
upper stretch, lugged in some inside the last eighth crowding the latter, was straightened beside PALACE KITTEN, all out but did not have enough left.
MIND YOUR OWN pressed PALACE KITTEN from just outside, went for the lead on the turn, bumped with IMPERIAL MOMENT upper stretch, was
crowded by the latter as she began to wear down inside the furlong marker and continued to yield. MOVE ON OVER was hustled to be an early factor but
began to faded from inside on the turn. CARNAVAL CONQUEST stayed off the inside and failed to menace. TOWN AGENDA was hustled along from
between horses but showed little. E Z TAPIT was not a factor in a ground-saving trip. There was a stewards' inquiry into the crowding initiated by IMPERIAL
MOMENT inside the final eighth. After their review, the stewards determined that when IMPERIAL MOMENT lugged in late the eventual outcome of the race
was not affected

Footnotes
KARAYEL quickly sprinted clear, stayed off the rail, floated out further when asked leaving the bend and maintained full control while kept to task in the lane
until about thirty yards from the wire then was allowed to coast. CLEVER BOY progressed from just off the inside on the turn, drew clear for second as he
closed the gap some on KARAYEL upper stretch, leveled off the final furlong but was clearly best of the others. LEE LA DEW without early speed, though
hustled along, advanced from inside on the bend, progressed between rivals in the stretch, took over third inside the final sixteenth and kept CARSON
RULES at bay for the show. CARSON RULES chased from between horses, lost ground angling out six wide at the top of the lane, passed tired ones and
was closing in for third late. COPPER CROSSING bobbled a bit as he broke on top, was soon chasing KARAYEL from along the rail and steadily yielded
after two furlongs. GOLD INCENSE chased from midpack on the backstretch and began to fade from path four on the bend. BOLD ATTACK raced closest
to KARAYEL in the early going, fanned to path four entering the stretch and gave way between rivals. EUGENE failed to menace in a wide trip.

Footnotes
DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT broke on top and was soon well clear of the rest, showed the way just off the inside then widened command under a drive in the
stretch. STOPSHOPPINGAMY urged along from outside, moved clear for second from path three then could only hold her position in the late going. TIZ
HOPPIN progressed from inside on the turn to take over third on the bend then failed to have a serious stretch bid. GHAALEB'S APPEAL was not a threat in
a wide trip. LOUIE P chased from inside, angled out looking for a clear path on the turn, came into the lane from path four and lacked a significant response.
GHAALEB'S MAGIC was an early factor between foes but gave way on the bend. TAP'S LULLABY broke with the pack but was somewhat slow to find her
stride after brief crowding, saved ground and had little to offer for the drive.

Footnotes
FANCY EMPRESS was bumped then jostled briefly with PRETTY GITA and shuffled back at the start, settled, lost ground widest through the turn, all out in
the lane and got up in time. FILLY FROM ILLY chased in midpack from outside, advanced three wide on the bend, fanned to path five for the stretch run,
rallied inside the last furlong to lead briefly between rivals deep stretch but was outfinished in a game effort. REPEAL soon had the lead, had the rail on the
turn, drifted out some entering the lane, drifted out briefly midstretch, was straightened but did not have enough left in the waning yards. AIKEN TO BE
TAKIN chased from just off the inside, fanned out some for the drive and showed a willingness to run late. PRETTY GITA was jostled briefly at the break
and also shuffled back, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail some into the stretch and made a strong move the final eighth. MEETMEINSTLOUIE
broke inward, bumping FANCY EMPRESS, pressed the early pace from outside, was two wide on the turn, forced out some to stay clear of REPEAL
entering the lane and began to wear down the last furlong. COOKIN ROSES chased from inside, came off the rail some on the bend, angled out behind
FANCY EMPRESS upper stretch and also showed a willingness to run late. BOBBIE TOO TOO was a factor just inside MEETMEINSTLOUIE on the
backstretch but faded along the rail on the turn.
