Footnotes
CAYCEE'S MARK altered outside a rival heading up the backstretch as that one moved in, stalked three wide on the turn, drifted six deep into upper stretch,
took command at the furlong marker and edged clear. QUITE LOVELY set the pace moving in to be in the two path entering the turn, came out four wide
turning for home, was outkicked. SPECIAL PRIDE broke outwardly bumping a rival, stalked the leaders four wide on the turn, moved out seven deep into
upper stretch, ran along for show honors. BAND OF GLORY tracked inside on or just off the rail, lacked the needed late kick. ZIVA DA'VID switched out
early racing off the inside at the rear, went three deep on the turn, failed to rally. OUR SOARING ANGEL was bumped and steadied at the start, went three
wide into the turn, swung seven wide into upper stretch and ran on. SUNNY JEWEL pursued the leaders five wide, dropped back and came up empty.

Footnotes
SILVER PONZI set the pace racing off the inside, went three wide on the turn, kicked clear and was taken in hand late. KEY TO THE CITY angled in after
the start, was urged forward inside, eased back and switched out about the seven-sixteenths to go two to three wide on the turn, secured the place inside
rivals. IMPUTED broke awkwardly and slowly spotting the field a couple lengths, angled in heading up the backstretch, went in the two to three path on the
turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch and ran along for show. BARBARA'S CHAMP was up close early, dropped back off the leading pair racing three
wide between runners into the turn, angled six wide at the top of the stretch and ran on to improve. WAYLAY pursued from outside the second flight going
five wide on the turn, weakened. MR LEVI CANYON was getting out in the early stages, pressed from inside a foe but in the two path on the turn, came up
empty in the stretch. MICKEYS GOLD settled at the rear outside a rival, went three to four wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. F S
POSITRACK chased between runners in the second flight four wide through the turn, angled eight wide turning for home, came up empty.

Footnotes
BIG MAC DADDY raced off the early leaders inside, began to shift out at the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch six wide, launched a strong rally in late
stretch to get up just before the wire. COWBOY COOL stalked from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths,
edged clear but was caught late. DIRT ROAD RED moved forward between runners to prompt the pace, took a narrow lead from the three-eighths to the top
of the stretch racing two wide on the turn, kept on but was outkicked. MITHQAAL raced close-up early, dropped back off the leaders going two to three wide
mid-pack through the turn, gained late along the inside. WILMAS IRISH ROVER raced outside off the leaders, went four to five wide on the turn, had no
extra. BRICKBAT settled outside at the rear, was never a threat racing several paths removed from the rail. BAYTOWN MACCA set the early pace, dueled
inside after the opening quarter into the turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
SUNSCREEN attended the pace from outside going three then five wide on the turn, continued to float out six wide at the top of the stretch and drifted out
further in the lane whilst safely clear. SHIO settled off the leaders, advanced outside foes four to six wide on the turn, came into upper stretch seven deep,
made no headway on the winner while being carried out just a bit. DADDY WHAT IF steadied after the break and was unhurried thereafter, moved out from
three to six wide on the turn, tapped on the brakes just slightly turning for home in behind rivals then moved out further to be eight wide and with clear room,
could make no significant rally late while securing show honors. GOLDEN BAND was within range, made a mild bid four wide late on the turn then evened
out. DESERT DANGER bumped a foe just lightly early up the backstretch, tracked in behind two to three wide, had no late kick. FULL OF DRIVE settled off
the pace, saved ground early on the turn before being tipped out midway on that bend, was four wide coming past the quarter pole and had no rally in the
drive. AISLE RUNNER vied between runners and turned up empty. FRANKS DEHERE was lightly bumped in the early going and sent forward inside to
contest the pace, faltered and faded. MR MOO showed brief foot close up to the leaders then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
WILLY TELL HIM stalked the pace, went four to five wide on the turn, struck the lead at the furlong marker and moved clear. CATABILITY was mildly
coaxed forward inside to contest the pace, moved out to the two path early on the turn, was clear midway on that bend but proved second best.
RINESHAFT attended from outside, exchanged a light brush heading to the turn, went three wide on that bend, lacked the needed late kick. SMART
SPREE bumped a rival lightly at the start, switched off the inside up the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn angling eight wide into upper
stretch and ran on for the minor award. NO DOUBT was lightly bumped at the start, raced inside on or just off the rail, lacked room near the quarter pole,
angled out for some coming six wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SMOOTHING IRON settled at the rear, went three to four wide on the turn,
passed tired rivals but was unable to threaten. BISCUIT SNATCHER hopped and veered out at the break then advanced outside rivals, went five to six wide
on the turn, faltered and faded. STORMIN L D exchanged a light brush heading up the backstretch vying between rivals, came up empty.

Footnotes
BURNZ DA BOSS stalked early then steadily advanced into the turn three wide taking command by the midpoint of that bend, kicked clear in upper stretch
and widened late. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP settled mid-pack, went four then five wide on the turn, split rivals in upper stretch and secured the place.
ROCKS A BLACK SUIT tracked mid-pack inside, found room along the rail leaving the turn, came out at the three-sixteenths, got show honors.
RUNNINGINTHERAIN got away well then settled mid-pack outside runners, went five to six wide on the turn, evened out in the stretch. REVOLT AND RIOT
shifted in early, saved ground on the turn advancing past foes and kept on in the lane. GREENBRIER chased the pace, moved out from two to four wide on
the turn, weakened in upper stretch but passed a couple tired foes. BABO STORM raced well back, swung eight wide into the stretch and improved position.
MAGIC IS FLYING shifted in heading up the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and was not a threat. COMMISSIONER DAVID was within
range going four wide on the turn, faltered and faded. GOGO OXBOW set the pace inside to the turn, drifted out three wide leaving that bend, came up
empty. FIRST COUNT was unable to threaten after racing four to five wide on the turn.

Footnotes

from outside, advanced five wide on the turn coming nine wide into upper stretch and clear, just failed to last. SIXTH GEAR broke awkwardly, settled into
stride, swung thirteen wide into the stretch and gained late. CASH CRUZER was outpaced early, advanced outside six wide on the run, came twelve deep
into upper stretch and improved. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING raced in the back half of the field going five wide on the turn, came out eleven wide in upper
stretch and improved position late. RARE COIN attended the pace outside, went four wide on the turn, weakened. UNDER RAPPES tracked inside on or
just off the rail and had no late bid. SANDIA'S BEST vied three wide and between runners, came up empty. DUKE CITY KITTY was outpaced early and
failed to threaten. REBEL RYETTE vied inside foes just off the rail, faltered and faded. WILD FIREWATER showed some brief speed inside, steadily
retreated. JAZZ BOULEVARD broke awkwardly and was not a factor.
