Footnotes
KRUG secured the inside into the first turn and was well handled prompting the pace, responded and moved through along the rail heading to the quarter
pole, struck the top entering the lane, kicked away under left handed asking in mid stretch then continued to widen while steadily hand ridden the final
sixteenth. ILLUSTRIOUS was used four wide to join the pace fray into the first turn, took over soon after then went clear near the three quarter pole, set a
rated pace two wide, had the winner slip through to his inside nearing the quarter pole, proved no match leaving the three sixteenths but kept on with good
effort to save the place. PRINCE OF PORTLAND settled off the pace, edged up a bit into the far turn, worked between runners nearing the stretch, swung
out five wide but could only muster up a mild late response. GREYLOVER steadied off heels into the first turn, recovered and rated within range while
saving ground, was under asking around the final turn, stayed inside for the drive and made a mild run but flattened out through the final seventy yards.
SCHOOLYARD BULLY , taken to rate early, moved up between foes mid way through the backstretch run and stalked, was under asking four wide while
pursuing into the stretch then faded in the final furlong. PRINCIPALITY , between foes early, chased three wide into the far turn and dropped back.
DONTFORGETTOBLINK , three deep around the first turn, dropped back off the pace nearing the five eighths and came up empty.

Footnotes
EMBRACE THE WHINNY , patiently handled early, raced in the two path on the turn, eased out to the three path in upper stretch, gained command
approaching the eighth pole and drew away under steady handling. HARPER'S DO lacked speed, moved up in the three path leaving the turn, angled four
wide in upper stretch, bid for the lead, raced erratically and flattened out. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , clear mid way down the backstretch, angled in, set the
pace along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE bore out leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn,
eased out to the two path in upper stretch and was not a factor. TEXAS GIRL prompted the pace two wide and weakened. ICY REPLY chased the pace,
circled the turn four wide, gave way in upper stretch and was eased late. MIRACLE MISCHIEF dropped back on the turn and was eased through the stretch.

OUR LUCKY MAN broke sharply then drifted out a bit soon after and brushed with a rival, was taken off the inside and settled between runners, took closer
order into the lane, bid three wide between runners leaving the quarter pole and wrested command from JUSTINTHENICKOTIME, sparred to the inside of
that rival past the eighth pole, kicked clear then held firm under right handed asking. JUSTINTHENICKOTIME prompted the pace off the rail and under
some rating, was given his cue mid turn and went after the leader, took a short lead in the four path in upper stretch, ceded to the winner with about three
sixteenths to go, fought on outside that one past the furlong grounds and continued with good energy. INK , off the pace and three deep into the turn,
ranged up five wide outside rivals to loom three sixteenths out, failed to kick on past the eighth pole and flattened out. IMAGE MAKER cleared early and set
the off the inside, met bids into the lane, gave little resistance and retreated through the final furlong. SCIENCE (IRE) , brushed soon after the break, stalked
inside rivals, took closer order approaching the stretch, failed to go on leaving the three sixteenths and gave way. PER RULING #22-083 FROM THE
MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, JUSTINTHENICKOFTIME WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

DAWNLAND saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, found room along the rail to take the lead inside SENSON turning for home, dueled and drove
clear late. SENSON sprinted to the early lead, was kept in the two path around the turn, dueled outside the winner in the stretch and gave way grudgingly.
DATE NIGHT KISSES chased the pace, raced inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. QUEEN OF CLASS , up close outside horses early, circled the
turn four wide, gave way and drifted in near the eighth pole. WET MY BEAK , four wide on the turn, gave way. MOLISE was outrun.

AWESUMMER vied two wide between rivals past the five eighths then poked a head in front, handled outside pressure into and around the turn, moved
clear approaching the lane, opened up a solid advantage under left handed asking in mid stretch then maintained a comfortable margin while kept to task.
UNCOMMON VALOR sped to the front then was joined by a trio of foes nearing the five eighths, rated back along the rail near the half mile marker and
stalked, was under coaxing to hold position mid turn, stayed inside into the lane, shifted out some late and came back on willingly to earn the place. TRIPLE
TITOS edged up to the inside of runners after breaking a bit slowly, stalked into the turn then eased out to give chase, raced four wide between horses
entering the stretch, advanced to the closest pursuer in mid stretch then hung late. LIFESPAN , brushed at the break, raced three wide into the turn, chased
off the rail into the stretch but came up empty. THRUSTER moved up three wide between horses nearing the five eighths and forced the pace, pressed
outside the winner around the turn, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. TYLER TIME , with the pace four deep past the five furlong
pole, forced the issue three deep leaving the far turn, was under asking past the five sixteenths and weakened. DISPUTED NOTION , off the pace while four
wide, dropped back.

furlong and was up in time. MIT MAZEL , four deep entering the first turn, moved over to the two path entering the backstretch, gained the lead mid way
down the backstretch, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and just missed. GOOD MEASURE lacked speed, raced inside horses
in the stretch and offered a mild rally. CHAMPAGNE TOAST , never far back, raced in the two path on the far turn, eased out to the three path for the drive
and lacked a rally. LADY FOX was outrun. FUDGE CAKE showed speed along the inner rail and weakened leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
DAY THE MUSIC DIED broke sharply then relaxed off the pace while three wide, moved up and took aim as a duel developed leaving the far turn, circled
four wide in hand into the lane, moved clear without much asking in mid stretch, widened under a bit of urging then was geared down through the final
yards. EXTRA MEDIUM lagged well back, saved ground into the lane, moved up past the eighth pole, shifted out late and finished with decent energy to nab
the place. BIG HAMBONE sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, met an outside threat leaving the far turn, sparred to the quarter pole, ceded to
the winner inside the three sixteenths then faded. PET'S NIGHT , jostled between runners at the break, saved ground off the pace, eased out for the drive
and had a mild response. TOM TERRIFIC came in at the break and bumped soundly with PET'S NIGHT, corrected and raced well back while three wide,
shifted five wide for the drive but lacked a bid. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT came out at the break and bounced around with a rival, corrected and pulled his way
to a tracking spot, bid outside the leader around the far turn, dueled to about the quarter pole then faltered.
