Footnotes
LA V. got pinballed leaving the gate and steadied soon after, advanced two wide around the turn, tipped out in upper stretch, rallied outside a pair of rivals
nearing the sixteenth pole and bested SPANISH CHANNEL in the end. SPANISH CHANNEL chased the top pair off the rail then outside a rival into the turn,
entered the lane two wide then tipped outside the leader, bid between rivals and got outkicked by the winner. SHE LOVES KARAOKE bumped in the
beginning, steadied off heels early, lacked room and steadied again entering the turn, gained a clear path around the turn, remained inside to the stretch,
rallied up rail and gained the show. READY JET GO dueled for command inside a rival, shook free past the five-sixteenths pole, led clear into the final
furlong, run down by a pair of rivals at the sixteenth pole and weakened late. CAYTON KID chased inside to the turn, drifted out around the bend and
bobbled past the quarter, came four wide into the stretch and went evenly in the furlong grounds. ST HELENA settled in mid-pack off the rail, steered into
the three path for the turn, exited the bend four wide, moved out further in upper stretch and failed to threaten. STOIC LUNA came in and bumped rival at
the start, chased three wide into the turn, angled to the fence around the bend, jumped a shadow in upper stretch and could not rally. CASILLALATER
chased outside a rival early then got shuffled between foes nearing the seven-sixteenths pole, traveled two wide around the turn and faded. FLAG SALUTE
bobbled slightly at the start, went up to duel for command from outside, lost touch with the leader midway around the bend and gave way in the drive.
ROSES R BLUE shifted in at the start, trailed into and around the bend while saving ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ROMAN EMPRESS away quickly from the gate, chased the leader three wide then between rivals on the first turn, was the closest pursuer under coaxing
through the far turn, drew alongside into the lane, took over and cleared outside the eighth pole, challenged late from outside and held on. NANG SINGHA
hit the gate and broke a step slow, stalked along the inside, shifted to the two path with a quarter mile remaining, came out under left-handed urging the
lane. SO SOFTLY cleared rival four wide into the first turn, angled down to the two path around the bend, controlled the pace up the backstretch, saved
ground through the far turn, challenged into the lane, relinquished command in upper stretch and flattened to third. LOVELY LOLA stumbled slightly at the
start, traveled four wide into the first turn then stalked three deep into the backstretch, remained outside rivals through the middle stages, entered the lane
three wide and lacked a late bid. DADDY'SFAVORITESON chased outside a rival then got shuffled back between foes on the first turn, traveled at the rear
in the middle stages, saved ground to the lane, eased in the stretch and walked off. LOOKIN AT SWEETIE broke a step slow, went four wide into the first
turn, remained wide to the backstretch, dropped back into the second bend, eased on the far turn, pulled up at the eighth pole and walked off.

Footnotes
BRAN (FR) closest in pursuit of the leader up the backstretch, took the turn two wide, continued to chase COTOPAXI (IRE) from outside into deep stretch,
put in a late bid under right-handed urging and drove past in the closing moments. COTOPAXI (IRE) set the pace on the inside, roused leaving the turn,
urged right-handed approaching the eighth pole, continued clear into the final sixteenth but got run down by the winner late. DELAWARE (GB) stalked the
pace along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, finished willingly to earn the show but needed more to threaten the top pair in deep stretch. INDIAN
PEAK tossed his head in the early stages, stalked the pacesetter outside rivals, entered the lane three wide and flattened out. KANDEREL got boxed in
behind BRAN (FR) while between foes which made him uncomfortable for a bit, rounded the turn two then three wide and could not rally.

Footnotes
EMPIRE PASS brushed leaving the gate, prompted the pace outside the top pair, challenged with a quarter mile remaining, took control exiting the bend,
cleared in upper stretch and drew away under mild urging. LOMA VISTA got crowded a bit at the start and dropped back, settled out of range and moved to
the inside, swung out leaving the turn, drifted inward in the lane, could not threaten the winner late and was clearly second best. SUE ETTAS GHOST took
an awkward step early, lagged behind up the backstretch, traveled two wide through the turn, steered out nearing the eighth pole and summoned a mild rally
to earn the show. HEAD START dueled for command from inside, inched ahead around the turn, vied with two outer rivals leaving the bend, lost command
into the stretch and gave way. BONITA LEONA brushed inner rival leaving the gate, chased two wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and
faded. UNWRITTEN CODE dueled for command outside HEAD STAR, kept the pressure in the two path on the turn then between rivals past the quarter
pole and weakened down the stretch. PRINCESS ALEXIS traveled in range from outside, took the turn four then three wide while losing ground, eased in
the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
TRAINER PLEASE broke well and went up to take control, cleared rival past the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the front-end through the turn, led clear
into the final sixteenth and was all out to hold over a pair of closing rivals in the end. DANIEL'S MAGIC sat off the pace between rivals then moved inside
leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the bend, angled out in the drive, closed well but could not get by the winner. LANSDOWNE (GB) broke a bit
slow and got bumped from inside, tracked two then three wide on the turn, tipped four wide in the lane and finished willingly outside the top pair late. IRISH
PROPHET bothered by the winner and bumped outside rival leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, driven two wide into the lane and lacked late kick.
MAGIC MAN sat off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the turn three then two wide, moved out in the drive but lacked further response. GOLDEN
SANDALS broke a bit slow but got forced in by rival at the start, chased from inside near the back and failed to menace. MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT was off
a bit slow then veered in leaving the gate, showed early speed inside the winner then got put in tight at the five-eighths pole, stalked behind that rival from
inside, cut the corner into the stretch, then retreated in the lane. IVORY SKY dropped back early, took the turn two wide and made no impact.

Footnotes
GANADORA stalked the top pair well off the rail, went four into the turn, asked around the bend and came three wide into the stretch, drew alongside
MUSICA in the final sixteenth and got up in time. MUSICA was off a bit slow to begin, went up to duel for command outside a rival, put away. DEL MAR
DRAMA tracked wide while out of range in the early stages, went five then four wide on the turn and finished evenly in the final furlong. LITTLE RACHEL
broke a step slow, dropped back and angled in, traveled two then three wide on the turn and passed rivals for a minor award. GOVERNOR GOTEVEN
stalked from inside then tipped two wide around the turn and never responded when called upon. HOTITUDE dueled for command under coaxing inside of
MUSICA up the backstretch, could not match strides with that rival around the turn and weakened in the stretch. GOTHAM DESIRE bobbled a bit leaving
the gate, dropped back early, trailed outside a rival three then two wide on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SUITE MADAM BLUE stumbled and got brushed leaving the gate, pressed from outside then chased the leader into and around the turn, drew alongside in
upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole and drove clear. LUNATIC broke in and bumped rival at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside,
showed the way into the stretch, collared by the winner in upper stretch, lost command inside the eighth pole and held the place. ON PURPOSE away well
in the beginning then settled into a stalking position, raced outside a rival, two wide around the turn, tipped out and finished willingly for the show. RESPECT
MY CANDOR got crowded between rivals and put in tight early, raced along the inside then two wide into the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, moved
in some and kept on for a minor award. ALOHA KITTEN got bumped leaving the gate, raced between foes then outside a rival, traveled three to four wide
around the bend, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. DRAW ME took an awkward step crossing surfaces, chased between foes into and
around the turn, steered out in the lane and failed to threaten. BRISTOL BAYOU tossed her head and brushed rival at the start, steadied off heels over the
dirt crossing, got put in tight briefly down along the inside early, saved ground off the pace and was not persevered with in the final furlong. SAVVY GAL
jumped the dirt crossing, chased inside to the lane and weakened, then walked into the van following the race. MISS LOUNA (FR) off slow to begin, raced
outside rivals at the back into the turn, went three to four wide around the turn and never got involved. CHARETTE tracked outside rivals, dropped back,
three then two wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ROYAL SHIP (BRZ) chased the leader into the first turn then went up to challenged for command, lost contact briefly on the backstretch then re-engaged
AFFABLE at the half-mile pole, dueled around the far turn, took control and cleared past the quarter pole, then drew off under hand urging. TRIPLE TAP
rated in the two path early, stalked the pace off the rail to the far turn, driven three wide into the lane, could not make any headway on the winner late but
was clearly second best. AFFABLE sped to the front in the two path, challenged from inside around the clubhouse turn, inched away early on the
backstretch, pressured again at the four furlong mark, dueled around the far turn, failed to keep up with the winner past the quarter pole, weakened in the
furlong grounds and saved the show. SHOOTERS SHOOT was off a bit slow in the beginning, moved closer along the inside up the backstretch, steered
out in the furlong grounds and could not rally. RESTRAINEDVENGENCE went three wide around the first turn, stalked outside a rival then moved out and
raced four deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three to four wide and never rallied. EXTRA HOPE was off a bit slow from outside, went
five wide into the first turn, angled to the three path and steadied near the three-quarter pole, traveled between foes then two wide into the lane and could
not make an impact. LAMBEAU was off a bit slow to begin, went four wide around the first turn, traveled three deep and between rivals leaving the
backstretch, got shuffled early on the far turn, dropped back and tired.

Footnotes
DORITA'S HAPPY raced off the pace outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, tipped four wide gaining through the bend, cleared in upper stretch and
held safely over the runner-up. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ broke a bit slow, split rivals on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed well but could
not get by. SILENT BEAUTY showed speed from inside with rivals before taking control, cleared around the bend, drifted in and put MIX AND MATCH in
tight in upper stretch, then drifted in and bumped that rival past the sixteenth pole and kept on to secure the show. MIX AND MATCH bobbled leaving the
gate, chased in the two path then moved to the rail, put in tight quarters by SILENT BEAUTY in upper stretch, then got bumped by that rival past the
sixteenth pole halting any late momentum. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE showed early speed from outside, chased the leader outside a rival into and around the
turn, came three wide into the lane and flattened. BELLE MY BELLE sat off the pace outside rivals, came five wide into the drive and could not rally.
BOISTEROUSLY IRISH vied with rivals on both sides for command early, could not keep pace with the leader around the bend, chased two wide into the
lane and faded. CURLIN TO BILLIONS came away slow, traveled off the rail, tossed her head in upper stretch and was not a factor. LET IT REIGN chased
four wide into the turn, exited the bend three wide and weakened. LASSAROCK off slow to begin, moved up to mid-pack early on, got shuffled early on the
turn, lost ground around the turn and tired. DONA FLAMA saved ground and failed to menace. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS
DISQUALIFIED SILENT BEAUTY FROM THIRD TO FOURTH FOR DRIFTING IN, BUMPING AND TAKING THE PATH OF MIX AND MATCH IN THE
FINAL SIXTEENTH, COSTING THAT HER A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
BARRISTER'S RIDE stalked along the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, bid outside and dueled GHOSTEM in the stretch, drifted out and inward in the
lane and gamely prevailed. GHOSTEM set the pace on the inside, led clear under urging into the lane, fought with BARRISTER'S RIDE through the lane
and finished gamely in defeat. ELEGANCE CODE got shuffled between rivals early, settled in mid-pack on the inside, remained along the rail into the
stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. ELA CALIMERA MOU bothered leaving the gate, traveled off the pace, mid-pack outside a rival, tried to
advanced between foes but got put in tight around the far turn, tipped out in the lane and failed to threaten late while earning a minor award. AVERY BLUE
stalked two wide then between rivals, got blocked and had to halt all momentum at the nine-sixteenths pole, went three then four wide on the second turn
and lacked a late bid. TIZ MY PRINCESS steadied off heels while trailing into the first turn, swung five wide into the lane and showed a mild response to
improve position. BIG ATTRACTION was off slow to start, raced off the rail, asked three to four wide around the far turn and made no impact. LADY
BLACKBIRD was off a bit slow to begin then got shuffled back soon after the start, cut the corner into the lane and failed to menace. SHE'S A BIT SASSY
broke out, tugged early and pulled on the backstretch, chased three wide into the lane and weakened. MENSA ON TAP was hard to ride prior to the first
turn, moved to the inside, swung six wide into the stretch and came up empty. BELLEO'S MUSIC was closest in pursuit in the early going, dropped back
around the far turn and tired.
