Footnotes
KNOWHOWIKNOW circled rivals around the turn, was four deep leaving the turn, closed steadily outside rivals, brushed with RUN ON THE TRAIL inside
the sixteenth pole and was bumped by GUNHAND approaching the finish. GUNHAND , quickly clear, saved ground around the turn, tired in the drive and
bumped the winner when drifting out. SNOW CANDY , three deep mid way on the turn, angled in for the drive and rallie. MONEY CODE hugged the inner
rail on the turn, eased out a bit for the drive and had a mild, late gain between rivals. RUN ON THE TRAIL , three deep leaving the turn while chasing the
pace, was lightly steadied when brushing with the winner near the sixteenth pole. I'M NOT SLOW chased the early pace, raced in the two path on the turn
and weakened.

Footnotes
BOSS MAN J J got locked into a battle outside WHENIGETTOHEAVEN soon after the break, kept the pressure on and was put to solid hand asking
approaching the quarter pole, wrested a short lead with a sixteenth to go, switched over to his left lead soon after but held firm while kept to task.
WHENIGETTOHEAVEN , away alertly, set a pressured pace towards the rail, held grimly past the furlong grounds, ceded the lead a sixteenth out but kept
on valiantly to the wire. BRIDGE TO SUCCESS , off the pace while saving ground, was nudged along into the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, slipped
through to the inside of foes in mid stretch and finished up well. CLASSY UNION was sent up between rivals soon after the break and took a tracking spot
off the duel, chased four wide under a ride into the lane but finished evenly through the final furlong. ROLL ME OVER settled off the pace and off the inside,
was put to a ride past the three eighths, came three wide for the drive but failed to generate a solid finish. CLASS WIZARD had her rider lose his balance at
the break and was off a bit slowly, lagged back to the outside of a rival, angled five wide nearing the lane, moved up some in mid stretch then flattened out.
HIGHLAND DREAM tracked the duel while saving some ground, eased out under pressure into the stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded.
LUCKY HERB , inside early while off the pace, dropped further back.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN (AUS) broke on top and set the pace towards the inside, took pressure from the five eighths, came under a solid ride two wide past the five
sixteenths, spurted clear in upper stretch then steadily widened under strong handling through the final furlong. BEYOND THE VICTORY pulled his way
forward between foes past the seven eighths, moved alongside the winner mid way through the backstretch run, forced the issue three wide and under
asking into the lane, could not match strides leaving the three sixteenths but stayed on with good energy to hold down the place. BUMPERDOO , sluggish
early on while off the inside, was put to strong asking leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the stretch and had belated action. ASSEMBLY POINT
(BRZ) broke inward but quickly regrouped and found a forward spot towards the rail, tracked the leading trio past the five eighths pole, failed to kick on when
roused into the far turn, gave futile chase mid way on the final turn and faded. IRISH RIVIERA lagged back, was under a drive leaving the far turn while
saving some ground but failed to respond. HE'S A SHOOTER , hung out three deep while attending the pace, kept in touch while under a ride leaving the
three furlong pole, failed to kick on entering the lane and retreated.

Footnotes
HAMPDEN LANE stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up in the three path leaving the turn, challenged for the lead outside BLISS THIS
approaching the eighth pole, dueled with that one and got the bob in an extended drive. BLISS THIS set a pressured pace along the inner rail, drifted out
near the sixteenth pole, battled inside the winner and just missed in a game effort. ICY MINISTER , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened
through the stretch. PATRIOTIC PARTY , along the inner rail chasing the pace around the turn, angled wide in upper stretch and weakened. TRASH
TALKIN LARRY came out leaving the starting gate and was outrun. BODE LYNX , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path
on the turn while outrun. HE ROLLS prompted the pace two wide around the turn and gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
CHICA RABIOSA settled outside rivals early on, moved up five deep to join the fray nearing lane, was bumped and forced in a bit soon after, corrected and
kicked clear then pulled away under a drive. SHE'S GOT GAME , off the pace and between runners, angled out around the turn, raced five to six wide into
the lane and churned on willingly to gain the place. IMAGINE THE MOJO , taken to rate inside rivals, dropped in mid turn, slipped through along the rail to
threaten into the lane, chased then flattened out. MAGIC IN ME , bumped at the break, edged up inside through the opening quarter mile and tracked the
pace, eased back a bit then angled out around the turn, bid four wide between runners nearing the lane, was floated out a bit by BON FIRE DIVA and
bumped with CHICA RABIOSA soon after, regrouped to pursue then faded in the final sixteenth. LOLA FLO broke outward and bumped with MAGIC IN ME,
settled back off the pace, saved ground leaving the three furlong pole but failed to rally. CABRA CHICA broke slowly and was not a factor. MADAME
CLAUDE broke on top and had speed outside foes, dropped in near the five eighths, met a bid into the turn, dueled around the turn, raced two wide and was
joined from both sides soon into the lane, steadied briefly and tired. BON FIRE DIVA prompted the early pace towards the inside of MADAME CLAUDE,
rated back off that one, angled out and bid outside to engage around the far turn, dueled on near even terms past the three eighths, drifted out a bit battling
between foes into the lane brushing and floating MAGIC IN ME outward, steadied then dropped back. Following a stewards' inquiry and objection by the
rider of MAGIC IN ME, CHICA RABIOSA was disqualified from first and placed fourth.

rivals and was up in time under brisk urging. VICTORY GIVEN , three wide on the turn, drifted four wide approaching the stretch and rallied between rivals.
BULL SHARK , three deep entering the turn, gained the lead near the three eighths pole, opened a clear advantage approaching the stretch, remained well
off the rail in the lane and weakened late. CHRISATUDE saved ground on the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and rallied. PASCAL CHANT showed
speed along the inner rail and weakened. CONFUSION BABY BOY raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN , in the
two path chasing the pace to the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
D' RAPPER , confidently handled three wide outside BENANDJOE, moved clear in hand into the lane, responded when set down nearing the sixteenth
marker and held firm while kept to task. BENANDJOE disputed the pace between rivals leaving the chute, emerged in a battle to the inside of the winner
leaving the three quarter pole, sparred to the three eighths, was under asking to hold position into the lane and stayed on well to narrowly save the place.
ARMANDO R lagged well back, swung very wide under a ride into the lane, straightened away, leveled off leaving the three sixteenths but had his furious
rally fall short. THUNDERSHOOK settled in the clear, was put to ride leaving the far turn, angled five wide and rallied between foes. BOSS LOGIC , with the
pace early on while saving ground, tracked inside mid turn, was under pressure into the lane and faded through the final furlong. HONOR THE FLEET ,
three to four wide outside a rival and stalking the pace, was under asking past the three eighths and gave way. DOUBLEOSEVEN , close up between
horses, failed to kick on under a ride entering the lane and dropped back.

TORCH CARRIER advanced three deep to challenge for the lead leaving the turn, dueled outside DIAL EMMA REILLY through the lane and narrowly
prevailed. DIAL EMMA REILLY hugged the inner rail, bid for the lead mid way on the turn, dueled through the stretch and just missed in a game effort.
LAMBEAU LADY broke poorly, swung five wide leaving the turn, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. ALL ABOUT AUDREY sped to the early lead,
raced in the two path on the turn, failed to keep pace, swung to the four path in upper stretch and retreated. YOUKNOWWHATITIZZZ , four deep on the
turn, chased the pace to the stretch then gave way.
