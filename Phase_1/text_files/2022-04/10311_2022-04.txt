Footnotes
ON ICE stalked the moderately fast pace from a two wide path, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, steadily advanced though the lane while on the
left lead and made a late push to edge clear for the win. OMAHA RUTSCH pressed the moderately quick fractions, vied for the lead nearing the furlong
marker, was outfinished by ON ICE in the final stages but kept on to be best of the rest. BUBBLES IS ON FIRE chased the pace three wide on the turn,
advanced in upper stretch and continued that run to close for third in the end. NON ESSENTIAL was away a bit slowly, lacked speed to the turn while
saving ground, swung widest into the stretch run and passed tiring foes in the late going. ONCE was away alertly and was sent to set the pace, showed
good early speed through the turn, was caught approaching the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. TRIBUTE TO ART broke in at the start,
saved ground while in the second flight through the turn and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TRIBAL NATION broke alertly and cleared the field in hand into the first turn, was well rated while setting moderate fractions through the second turn, was
given a few reminders in upper stretch and was ridden out in the end. MOUNT PELLIAR saved ground while unhurried, waited for racing room in upper
stretch, was coaxed through an opening leaving the furlong marker and while no match for the winner was up to be a clear second. MYSTIC TRAVELER
stalked the pace from a two wide path, gave way in the stretch run and just held for third. MR BOTANICALS settled just off of the pace, lacked a final kick in
the drive but just missed for the show. DOUBLE THE GOLD settled off of the pace, was steered three wide on the second turn and lacked a late rally. REFI
NOW stalked the early pace, lost ground while three wide on the far turn and tired in the late stages. RICH WARRIOR stumbled leaving the break and was
away slowly, recovered to sit just off of the pace while saving ground, improved position along the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
EMMA'S DANCE broke alertly and was sent to set the moderately fast pace, shook clear of a pressing rival into the stretch run and kicked clear in the end.
SWANEE chased the pace from the inside, was outkicked in the drive but kept on to be best of the rest. GOING TO SHABOOMS lacked early speed, was
steered three wide along the turn and closed in the late stages to be a clear third. DANIELA BELLA stalked the early pace, advanced along the turn while
three wide and tired in the stretch. SEGURO stalked the pace, gained four wide along the turn and gave way in the stretch run. I'M SO ADORABLE settled
off of the pace, was guided four wide on the turn and was not a factor. ACAI contested the pace through the turn, could not match strides with the winner
into the stretch and faded in the late stages.

BLESSED BROTHER stalked the pace from a three wide path, was roused at the top of the stretch, closed well to catch HAKUNUI inside of the
sixteenth-marker and held safely in the end. HAKUNUI contested the early pace with ROISTER, edged clear of that rival leaving the furlong grounds, was
caught by BLESSED BROTHER in the final sixteenth and was clear of the rest for the place. ROISTER broke alertly, dueled for pace duties with HAKUNUI
through the turn, lost ground inside of the final furlong and was outfinished in the end. DANNY MICHAEL chased the pace four wide on the turn and did not
have offer a late kick. MAJESTIC LUCK was away slowly, lacked early speed to the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
IL CAPITANO took command of the pace into the first turn, set moderate fractions while establishing a clear lead through the half-mile marker, was
confronted in the final stages by MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH and determinedly held sway in the end. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH stalked the moderate pace, made
a steady gain on the far turn and into upper stretch, closed on the winner in the final stages and was denied for the win, while clear of the rest. EGOMANIA
settled off of the pace while traveling in the midflight, advanced on the far turn, was outfinished in the stretch but was clear for the show. ROYAL 'N RANDO
was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground into the second turn, was steered two wide into the stretch and made a mild late gain in the final stages.
TOFINO BAY settled off of the early pace, was roused two wide on the second turn and gave way in the drive. LYING GHOST was forwardly placed in the
early stages, steadied in tight quarters entering the first turn, dropped back quickly nearing the half-mile marker, was eased in upper stretch and walked off
under his own power.

MISS UNION settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong and made a late surge to
prevail. SLACK TIDE tracked the early pace, saved ground through the turn, closed in the final stages and just missed for the win, while getting up in time
for the place. O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke alertly and was sent to set the pace, maintained a clear lead into the final furlong, was caught inside of the
sixteenth-marker and was just edged out for the place. DULCE EMMA stalked the pace through the turn, was put to firm urging in mid-stretch and was
outfinished in the final sixteenth. TYCHE AWAITS YOU bobbled at the start and lacked early speed to the turn, was steered three wide nearing the
quarter-marker and was not a threat. LION'S LAIR chased the pace four wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. VIVA LA FIESTA chased the
pace three wide, lost ground in upper stretch, gave way in the late stages and was vanned off after pulling up.

Footnotes
J AND K EXPRESS stalked the pace three deep between rivals on the turn, closed in the late stages to confront MUCHA WOMAN, dueled with that foe to
the wire and just got up to prevail. MUCHA WOMAN was sent after the start and set fast fractions through the turn, was headed by the winner inside of the
sixteenth-marker, met that foe's bid while all out in the end and was nipped for the win. KITTY'S CANDY was a bit slow into stride early and lagged into the
turn, closed through the lane and got up in the final strides to secure third. MY LEGAL BET lacked early speed, mounted a two wide rally leaving the bend
and just missed for third in the end. CANAM GAL stumbled at the start, recovered to chased the pace five wide on the turn, advanced in upper stretch and
was outfinished in the final sixteenth. CAROLINA MIA was hustled leaving the start, stalked the pace four wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. LA
AGUILILLA stalked the fast pace from the inside, lost ground inside of the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages.
