Footnotes
PROUD AMERICAN was slow early, moved up four wide through the stretch run, surged late and just got up under all out pressure. VAZS DANCING HESS
stalked the early pace, led deep stretch while racing near the rail and just missed in a game effort. RB MUNCHIE showed good early speed to set the early
pace, veered out sharply just inside the seven sixteenths pole, bothered foes as his back heels were clipped. A stewards inquiry was lodged and disqualified
RB MUNCHIE to last place for interference. WMA FIREBALL checked sharply near the seven sixteenths pole, experienced traffic with the loose horse near
the three sixteenths pole, raced three wide in the lane and had not enough late after a troubling trip. UPTOWN MANONTOP failed to sustain a bid. RB
WHISTLIN DIXIE raced up close early, clipped heels near the seven sixteenths pole and was eased up on in the stretch. RB BAMER was bumped hard
near the seven sixteenths pole and unseated his rider.

Footnotes
CLAIMJUMPER stalked the early going, moved up two to three wide in the drive and drew clear late under strong handling. SI QUERE was slow early,
moved up five wide through the far turn and made a good late rally. PARABELLUM stalked the pace, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and
had not enough in the drive. JUST HANGIN RIDGE dueled for the early lead from the outside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. HEAVENLY
TRUMP was allowed to settle early on, angled seven deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CASH AND TIME was allowed to settle early on,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late response. STONEMEISTER was slow early, raced four wide and never was a factor. NOAH
was hustled along from the inside and faded. SHANGHAI GOLD was hard sent between rivals and tired readily in the drive.

CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR was slow early on, moved up three to four wide in the lane but had not enough. SARCASTIC TONE was forwardly placed to lay up
close early on and gave way. VICTORY BOULEVARD settled off the early going, raced near the inside and had no response.

to prove best under strong handling. OTTOTHELEGEND pressed the early pace, led deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. PINCH ASSAULT was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on and finished willingly while racing between rivals in the stretch run. NATE'S ATTACK stalked the pace, raced two to
three wide and had not enough in the drive. LEMON KICK settled off the early pace, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally.
AKTULGALI raced three wide and had no response. BIZZY LEGS showed good early speed and gave way. CONVICTION TRADE was slow early and
never threatened.

WITT'S TAQUITO showed good early speed and held gamely to be clear under strong encouragement. BIG ONE stalked the pace, raced along the inside in
the stretch run and finished second best. SILVER LUKE SILVER was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced four deep in the stretch run and
finished willingly to the wire. KING KONGO settled off the early going, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and made a good late bid.
FEARLESS PRINCE dropped back early on, raced along the inside in the stretch run but had not enough. COWBOY RIDGE stalked the pace, raced three
to four wide and had no final winning bid. PAPAWS BOY settled off the early pace, raced five wide in the lane and had no rally. MOONSHINERBOY hopped
at the break, raced six to seven wide through the upper lane and never threatened. PHARME'S PHAITH was allowed to settle, raced five deep in the lane
and had no response. WARRIORS HAVEN stalked the pace and weakened while racing four wide. WITH THE BAND raced along the inside and never was
a factor. A HUNK OF HEAVEN failed to respond.

Footnotes
HE'S PRETTY LUCKY rated through early stages then picked up the pace along the inside mid-way around the turn, tipped two wide in the upper stretch
then split foes gamely, dueled with FLIP THE COIN JANE in deep stretch and prevailed in final stride. FLIP THE COIN JAN tracked the pace through the
early going, launched a three wide bid around the turn, surged to duel for the late lead, battled back gamely and got denied in closing strides. THREE EYED
RAVEN took over the lead mid-way around the turn, continued to hold on top into the stretch, got collared by the outside duel in the final furlong and
weakened to shw. MIGHTY MERLE was not far back in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn, continued four wide in range a furlong out
and lacked closing kick. SILVER AND ACES raced off the early pace, was ridden along three to four wide into the lane and improved position without
threatening. LIL BIG MAN saved ground around the turn had no late response. SINGING ACES raced three to four wide around the turn and offered no late
rally. SECULAR STAGNATION raced in the back then three wide around the turn and had no response. CURLINS CAPO vied for the early lead then faded
mid-way around the turn. CROCODILE JACQUES vied for the early lead then retreated around the turn.

came under left handed pressure past the furlong marker, responded willingly, drew off and finished ridden out in the final sixteenth. GJALLARHORN settled
off the early pace, launched a bid into the stretch run, dug in four wide a furlong out and gained second best. GOLDEN FLASH opened up to a clear lead
around the first turn, set then uncontested pace through the backstretch and held clear around the final turn, got collared by the winner in the upper stretch
and weakened to show. MAGAZINE STREET was unhurried through early stages, hustled along two wide into the stretch run and had a mild improve.
BLURT raced four wide into the first turn, tracked the clear pacesetter through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid on the final turn then weakened in
the lane. SUEZ rated off the early pace, chased two wide around the final turn and never threatened. RUNNIN THE RED raced off the pace, saved ground
on the final turn then tipped two wide for the drive and lacked a rally. COUNTRY BRAVE raced near mid-pack, saved ground along the rail on the final turn
then faded. KING ARTHUR RIDGE raced three wide in the back around the first turn, continued unhurried, was ridden along four wide on the final turn and
failed to move into contention.
