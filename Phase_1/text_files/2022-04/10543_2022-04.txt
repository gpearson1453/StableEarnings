Footnotes
ANALOGY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took the
inside route into upper stretch, edged away to the eighth pole, dug in under threat through the final sixteenth and held on to prevail. BALTHUS (IRE) just off
the inside tracking the front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong but was ultimately
repelled at the finish. GRAND CAY tracked the pace along the inside from the pocket, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show honors. I AM THE LAW forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GOOD MEDICINE saved ground at the tail of the compact
field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
HYDRA brushed the outside of the gate at the start but broke near the front, pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, took the
lead into upper stretch, shook clear under the crop into the final furlong and proved best under strong urging. BUSTIN BAY chased the pace on the outside
then in the three path around the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop, pursued the winner to the wire and finished willingly for the place. AWESOME
INDRA went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. QUASAR tossed her head at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few
lengths, moved out while urged along at the rear, went around the turn in the four path and failed to threaten. SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN lost her footing at
the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, angled in while ridden along towards the rear, saved ground around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
SHE'S THE ONE tracked the pace along the inside patiently handled until roused cutting the corner into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the
eighth pole, edged clear briefly before coming under late threat and held safe to prevail. CARA'S DREAMER saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out swinging six to seven wide into upper stretch let out for the drive, closed well outside through to the
finish latching on the winner as she hit the wire. BARKIN just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing two to three wide at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then got outkicked to the finish while just preserving the show honors at the
end. MISCHIEVOUS DREAM just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, remained patiently handled until set down spinning three wide into upper
stretch, seized command straightened away, got displaced by SHE'S THE ONE nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. EPONA'S DREAM
three then two wide through the first turn, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. CHOOSE HAPPINESS saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, and was unable to make an impact. STEAL MY HEART established the front shortly after the start and
showed the way under a light rating hold along the inside, came under light coaxing with five-sixteenths to go and came under growing threat to the outside,
got roused spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away for home and weakened.

Footnotes
SNICKET bumped lightly with a foe at the start, stalked the pace on the far outside, went five then four wide around the turn, gained to take the advantage in
upper stretch, battled outside of two opponents to the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. LETMETAKETHISCALL showed speed then
pressed the pace between horses, vied in the two path around the turn, fought with multiple foes under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished
but just earned the place. CHASING CARA displayed good speed, showed the way on the inside under pressure, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the
advantage in upper stretch, kept on into the final sixteenth but was out-kicked and just missed the place but was well clear for the show. IMPAZIBLE
DONNA was recalcitrant and froze-up during the post parade, became very fractious in the gate and broke through the front of the stall then sat down
behind, was backed out and deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came away in good order, showed speed between horses under urging then chased
the pace, dropped back three then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. TOWERING ORBIT broke out then was corrected with a
hard tug of the left-rein and was off slow, settled at the rear, was roused while saving ground on the turn and came up empty. OUR SWEET GIRL bumped
lightly with a foe at the start, pressed the pace on the outside of three foes, was asked while four then three wide on the turn, dropped back coming to the
quarter-pole and capitulated.

Footnotes
SURPRISE BOSS broke in a step at the start under hustling, tussled briefly with DEEP COVER before that rival backed away inside, showed the way in
hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail.
DEEP COVER bumped at the start by G MUNNING, who broke inwards, advanced inside latched on the aforementioned foe early on before easing off, had
that rival take to the rail and was hard held off his heels down the backstretch and backed away conceding two lengths to the front into the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and ran on through to the finish to share in the place and show honors. VOLKERT just
off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to dead heat for
the place on the wire. UNCLE GEORGE got away to a hesitant beginning and came under hustling when conceding five to six lengths to the front when
sluggish early on, chased just off the inside from the tail of the field before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. BALI'S SHADE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung four then three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. KID D'ORO broke in at the start brushing MARBLE MOON, chased just off
the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued in the two path into upper stretch and weakened. SANDRONE coaxed from the gate, chased just
off the inside in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. G
MUNNING broke in at the start bumping DEEP COVER, chased along the inside under a ride from three furlongs out, continued along the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. MARBLE MOON brushed at the start by KID D'ORO, who broke inwards, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
SONIC SPEED went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably on the outside, was roused three wide on the final turn, rallied to the lead in
upper stretch, kicked clear into the final furlong and proved best under steady urging. EDDIE THE GREAT was asked leaving the gate, came out some into
the first turn, dropped from the three path to the two path around that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked late on the backstretch, chased in
the two path around the far turn, gained the advantage at the quarter-pole, brushed with a rival near the three-sixteenths then lost the lead to the winner and
proved no match while able to hold the place. EXALTED CHARM went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail around the opening bend, showed
the way down the backstretch, was asked along the rail on the far turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole then brushed with a foe around the three-sixteenths,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. OCEAN DEEP saved ground through the first turn, settled towards the rear,
rounded the far turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while improving position. ACTUARY (GB) settled
near the middle of the field while saving ground, was roused for more in the two path into the stretch and failed to rally. NOBLE CONQUEST was taken in
hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was reserved towards the back, came under urging in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the
stretch, had the rider lose his crop outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten. GHOSTMON was rated while four then three wide around the opening
turn, settled outside down the backstretch, was roused in the two path on the final turn, spun three wide into the stretch, raced between horses in the drive
and lacked the needed response. PRAYER BOOK went five then four wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, dropped back while
lugging out some four then five wide around the final turn and had nothing left. LABAN M MO dropped well behind early, saved ground through the first turn,
moved out early on the backstretch, lagged at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.
MALIBU STAR was sent hard from the start, saved ground around the first turn, was coaxed along towards the front, came under stronger encouragement
outside the half-mile pole, chased inside around the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FLAME established the front after a brief tussle with a host of forwardly placed rivals to show the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside
through the turn and came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under growing threat to the outside
and gamely rebuffed the challenge, then held on from another closing rival at the finish. ROYAL CURRENCY five paths off the inside early on got bumped
between foes and jostled six furlongs from home between BAVARIAN CREME and VIVAZANO, raced four wide until tucked briefly to the two path near the
turn then tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in behind the top pair,
tipped out to the three path near the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to miss at the end. BAVARIAN CREME five paths off the inside early on, tucked
four wide and bumped the aforementioned foe into VIVAZANO, with six furlongs to go, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, rallied to latch on the leader a furlong out and loomed boldly to the outside, then got rebuffed through to the finish
and was along clear for the show honors. DUCKPHAT chased along the inside from the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the wire. CABERNET TRAIL coaxed from the start, chased along the inside from near the rear of
the field, tipped to the two path into the turn, then got out five wide nearing the three-eighths and was placed to coaxing, swung four then three wide into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals. CAPITAL GAL chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch
and weakened in the drive. SECRET HIDEOUT coaxed from the gate, raced eight paths off the inside forwardly placed down the backstretch before tucking
three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. VIVAZANO three wide in pursuit,
got bumped by ROYAL CURRENCY with six furlongs to go due to pressure from BAVARIAN CREME, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and faltered. CERRETTA hustled from the gate, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
KAZMIKE broke out and brushed the gate then was corrected by the rider, angled in while going to the front, controlled the action while inside to the two
path around the turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, fought back to regain the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under
strong urging. UNIQUE UNIONS was well placed just off the early pace then chased the leader, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went four then three
wide on the turn, took the lead under a left-handed crop while still on his inside lead in upper stretch, swapped to the proper lead at the furlong marker, lost
the advantage back to the winner just before the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished but well clear for the place. BARESE broke in and brushed with a foe
then was hustled, moved out while hard ridden around the five-eighths, went five then four wide around the turn and weakened but earned the show. MO
DANCIN angled in while urged along towards the back, saved ground through the turn and failed to threaten. RED D G P broke a half-step slow, was ridden
along at the rear, went three then our wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. TOMMY GUN broke in and hit the gate then
brushed with a foe while off a step slow, raced towards the back under urging, went three wide around the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and came up
empty. MISTER LARRY tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two to three path through the turn and faded.

tucked back to the rail with three furlongs to run, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and angled out five wide into upper stretch let out for the
drive, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong and seized command nearing the sixteenth marker, then edged clear to the finish back in hand in the final jumps
to the wire. FORT WASHINGTON settled two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish and just got up for the place honors on the wire. CHANCEUX established the front and showed
the way just off the inside through the first turn before tucking inside down the backstretch, remained patiently handled settled into a comfortable rhythm until
placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole and the pressure in behind intensified, spun just off the inside into upper stretch set down for the drive, took to
the inside straightened away and dug in under growing threat, got displaced just outside the sixteenth marker, kept on to the finish and was nailed in the
very last jump for the place honors while safe for the show. OHTWOOHTHREEFIVE just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong from home, then flattened out in the late stages. HEAVEN STREET tracked
the pace along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive in behind
CHANCEUX in upper stretch lacking daylight to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. MASETA forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim
of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch unable to quicken with the rest of the field, then weakened

Footnotes
SHARP SENSATION veered in at the start and bumped with a foe, chased the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn, gained to make a four wide
bid into the stretch, battled with BOINTHEBACK while a bit green into the final sixteenth, came out and bumped with HE'S GOT IT twice late and narrowly
prevailed under strong urging. HE'S GOT IT brushed the inside of the gate at the start and knocked the jockeys inside foot a bit loose from the iron, bumped
soundly with LIMIT UP while the rider reached down to adjust his iron early, settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch,
chased outside into the final furlong, gained to make a bid into the final sixteenth, was bumped twice by the winner late and just missed. BOINTHEBACK
was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, dueled with the winner
in the stretch and just missed while just able to get the show. JOSHUA broke a tad slow, settled under some urging, went three wide on the turn, was
roused for his best into upper stretch, dropped in inside the furlong marker and finished with good courage to just miss the show. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK
was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn, came six wide itno the stretch and gained while finished willingly. TONALISTIC was
bumped at the start and forced in then checked, raced at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained some ground
while failing to impact. REAP WHAT YOU SOW broke in and bumped with a foe then bumped with another foe while off a step slow, moved out towards the
rear, rounded the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, moved out into the final furlong and was no factor. LIMIT UP bumped with a foe at
the start, was bumped soundly early, settled off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, was roused into upper stretch and failed to rally.
CROSTATA B C bumped with a foe at the start then was sent hard, angled in while going to the front, vied inside around the turn, lost the advantage into
upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. MARTINI MARGARITA was urged along on the inside, saved ground on the turn, came
out into the stretch and failed to respond. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF HE'S GOT IT AGAINST SHARP SENSATION FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, SHARP SENSATION WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND
