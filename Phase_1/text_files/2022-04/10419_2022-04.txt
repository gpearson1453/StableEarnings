Footnotes
FUEGO CALIENTE, forwardly placed nearest the rail tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced inside that foe to prompt the pace after a half, briefly awaited
an opening racing into the far turn, continued with a steady bid nearing upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker, shifted out under
right handed pressure and edged clear. CASTLE KING, forwardly placed three deep tracking just off the pacesetter, moved to press the issue between foes
in that path racing through the far turn, dueled outside the winner to midstretch but proved no match late. TIZ TRIUMPHANT tracked off the second flight
outside foes racing to the backstretch, tipped out four wide nearing the five furlong marker while being prompted to advance, continued in that path into the
far turn and flattened out in the drive while continuing well enough to prevail for a share. DOHKO, reserved outside foes to the backstretch, continued with
an even effort to gain some position between rivals late. YOU'RE IN COREY, urged to the lead a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, dueled for
command between foes into the far turn and gave way nearing midstretch. SUPER EDGAR tracked off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch
but offered no rally.

Footnotes
MESA SKYLINE was rated outside foes tracking the leaders from out of striking distance on the backstretch, advanced on the pacesetter three wide
entering the turn, took over nearing upper stretch and made the balance of the pace under right handed pressure. WILSHIRE DIAMOND, reserved outside
foes while dropping out last on the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes nearing upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for
the place honors late. CANDY MY BOY broke slowly, tracked the pace between foes from just out of striking distance, shifted out three wide nearing upper
stretch and continued with interest while being outkicked for second. LAUDERDALE settled inside foes in the opening stages, saved ground to upper stretch
but had no closing bid. HIGHLAND PARK HERO, urged clear along the inside, dictated the pace into the turn, proved no match when confronted by the
winner and gave way leaving midstretch. D'ROCK, urged to a forward placing pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch, emptied out early.

Footnotes
KARL CARES was settled outside foes to the backstretch, came under pressure to advance on the leaders four wide racing into the far turn, was carried out
racing through the stretch but prevailed under firm encouragement. STRONG EAGLE was urged to set the pace dictating terms just off the rail to the
backstretch, dueled for command between foes through the far turn to upper stretch, was carried out into the winner's path by MAPACHE G leaving
midstretch but continued grudgingly to the end while just failing to contain the winner. MAPACHE G, reserved while angling to the inside racing to the first
turn, advanced inside the pacesetter after a half to press the issue along the rail entering the far turn, drifted out contesting the issue to late stages but
couldn't fend off the top pair. COMMANDER BIZ, forwardly placed three wide prompting the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, pressed the issue between
foes in that path into the far turn and gave way racing into upper stretch. GHOST OF KHOZAN, in touch with the first flight between rivals racing to the first
turn, was eased off the leaders to track those foes between rivals on the backstretch, dropped out last racing into the far turn continuing under patient
handling, tipped out three wide entering the stretch while being prompted to advance but had no rally.

Footnotes
COFFEE ESSENCE, in touch with the leaders three wide attending the pace under light rating in the opening stages, pressed the issue outside a rival
through the turn, altered course to the inside when losing her path to BALLYMENA racing past midstretch but continued with a solid late response to wrest
the advantage under right handed pressure. The latter was urged between foes disputing the pace through the backstretch, edged forward to dictate terms
on a narrow advantage into the bend, dueled for command into upper stretch, drifted out under left handed pressure racing past midstretch then yielded to
the winner late. MAKIN IT LOOK EASY tracked just off the first flight four wide between foes in the opening stages, then continued willingly in that path to
close the gap on the top pair late. MISS INEZ angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the bend, then came around a tiring foe while
continuing evenly along the inside late. MISS ENCISO was urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset through the backstretch, gave way racing
into the turn. HELENS SPIRIT was urged in pursuit of the leaders three wide between foes while racing in close quarters approaching the turn and gave way
nearing the lane. IVY WAY was off slowly and proved no factor. PRINCESS OF SWORDS raced five wide early behind the second flight while under some
prompting, was pulled up outside foes leaving the half mile marker and was vanned off the course.

Footnotes
CIDSTAYINURLAINE, urged to a forward placing just off the inside racing to the backstretch, shifted to the rail racing into the far turn while being prompted
to advance, came through inside the pacesetter leaving midstretch and edged forward in time under firm right handed pressure. ASTERS D'ORO, caught
four wide racing through the first turn while under prompting to gain terms with the leaders, moved to gain the advantage three deep entering the
backstretch, shifted inwards to dictate terms on a narrow advantage between foes through the far turn, held sway in that path to midstretch but couldn't
contain the winner late. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY, prompted between foes to a forward placing racing to the first turn, tipped outside ASTERS D'ORO
entering the backstretch while being rated off the first flight between foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance while tipping out four wide entering
the lane and continued with interest to close the gap on the top pair. SCHATZI settled well off the leaders racing to the far turn, then advanced five wide
nearing upper stretch, drifted out late but continued with interest to improve position to the end. BRAMBLE BUSH tracked off the first flight between foes
racing to the first turn, steadied a bit avoiding tight quarters entering the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside the pacesetter challenging that rival
three deep racing through the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. FARCICAL broke awkwardly, settled last to the far turn and passed only tiring rivals.
BUMBLELICIOUS angled to the inside tracking off the first flight to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and steadily faded in the drive. MYSTIC
DREAMS was settled inside foes in early stages, tipped out while being prompted to advance between foes on the far turn but had no closing response.
MAJESTIC QUEEN tracked the leaders three wide between foes off the first flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded after a half.

DAZZLING SUNSHINE ducked outwards a bit at the start, was quickly righted to track just off the leaders a bit off the inside inside a rival racing to the turn,
advanced to challenge between foes in upper stretch, then wrested the advantage and edged clear late under firm encouragement. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE
was urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch, edged forward nearing upper stretch, tipped to the three path entering the lane, resisted
the winner's bid to midstretch but proved only second best. KILLARGUE'S GIRL settled between foes in early stages, swung out four wide racing into upper
stretch and continued with some late interest to prevail for a share in time. SUMMER OF MISCHIEF was urged inside a rival disputing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, dueled for command into upper stretch and gave way. SHE'S PEACHY KEEN, urged to a forward placing three deep tracking just
off the leaders racing to the turn, faded into upper stretch. SONNET settled along the inside early and failed to menace thereafter.

Footnotes
DREAM LINER (BRZ) reserved between foes in the opening half, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance and
produced a stout rally to wrest command under firm handling. MINNESOTA LUCKY sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin to
the stretch but proved no match when confronted by the winner. THRU THE VINE was rated outside foes off the second flight, advanced on the leaders
three wide between foes racing through the far turn but lacked the needed late kick while prevailing for a share. WESTWARD LOOK was rated tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was urged to lodge a brief bid outside that foe nearing the lane but flattened out midstretch. I SAY I PLAY was
rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the first turn, angled to the inside after a half, saved ground to upper stretch while being prompted to
advance but lacked the needed late kick. TOSS, swerved, then steadied leaving the chute while angling to the inside, saved ground on the far turn, tipped
out racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. THOMOND PARK broke awkwardly to race last to the backstretch, then passed inside some tiring rivals
in late stages. NINJA DUST settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to mount a serious challenge. CHIC N WILBUR switched out tracking the
leaders as part of the second flight racing three deep to the far turn, drifted wide nearing upper stretch and quickly gave way. CAN'T TRUMP KITTEN was
settled between foes, then came up empty nearing the far turn while suffering no apparent mishap.

Footnotes
JUST LIKE INDY, reserved last while shifting well off the inside racing through the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders four wide nearing upper
stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest the advantage and go clear under firm left handed pressure. SPARKLING PLENTY settled into stride
shifting off the inside on the backstretch, angled to the rail on the turn, then advanced inside foes racing into upper stretch but was outkicked by the winner.
FIRST GOLD was urged disputing the pace inside foes racing through the backstretch, dueled for command a bit off the rail into upper stretch but yielded to
the top pair late. JULIE'S GRACE joined the pace three wide in early stages, pressed the pace in that path to upper stretch and gave way leaving
midstretch. DE PURA SANGRE, forwardly placed four wide tracking just off the leaders racing to the turn, faded between rivals racing three deep into the
lane. NAVAL WAVE angled inwards while being urged between foes pressing the pace in the opening half and gave way nearing the lane. ESTILO
DIFERENTE angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn but dropped out early.

Footnotes
MAINTAINER, forwardly placed three wide racing to the first turn, continued with a steady advance just outside the pacesetter to challenge that rival leaving
the far turn and edged forward late under firm handling. BET sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid
past midstretch but couldn't contain that foe while prevailing for the place honors. DELTA RIDGE, reserved along the inside to the backstretch, switched out
four wide approaching the far turn, then continued in that path to the closing stages while finishing with interest to close the gap while prevailing for a share.
MORE THAN A DANCE tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, made steady progress in that path to upper stretch but was
outkicked by the top trio. SON OF NEOLITHIC angled inwards tracking the leaders between foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, lost ground to
the leaders racing into the far turn, then shifted five wide in the closing stages to find his best stride late. JIMMY THE BOOT settled off the second flight
between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes nearing upper stretch and came up empty entering the lane. BRUCE
BANNER angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, saved ground to upper stretch and faded in the drive. URBAN BEACH settled last early and proved
no threat. LIKESO dropped out early. JOE IRISH flashed brief pace between foes and gave way abruptly after a half.
