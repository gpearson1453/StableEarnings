stretch, shifted out soon into the lane and set his sights on the leader, reeled that one in while under left handed asking, forged clear with a sixteenth
remaining then held firm while kept alert. NO MONEY DOWN , well back while off the inside, circled four to five wide into the lane, drifted in briefly near the
three sixteenths, swung back out and finished strong. GOLDEN AVIEATOR opened up early, set a quick pace towards the inside, raced two wide into the
stretch, offered brief resistance in mid stretch then faded. MUGSY MALONE stalked the pace three wide, was under a hearty ride past the five sixteenths,
shifted out a bit wider soon into the lane but failed to seriously respond. WORLD OF FOOLS , bumped at the break, raced off the pace, was under pressure
off the rail leaving the three eighths and had no response.

MAVILUS vied early to the inside of a rival, rated back off the leaders leaving the five eighths, tracked patiently while saving ground mid turn, came back
along the rail to re take command nearing mid stretch and drew out under a drive. BREVIARY lacked speed while off the inside, was under pressure mid
turn, swung five to six wide and closed belatedly to second best. MI CLEOPATRA AND I disputed the pace outside the winner early on then to the inside of
ACADIAN GIRL into the turn, moved clear of that one around the turn, raced two wide into the stretch, was hooked from her inside nearing the eighth pole
and faded. ACADIAN GIRL broke a bit slowly, regrouped and angled three wide advancing past the three quarter pole, bid three wide outside MI
CLEOPATRA AND I to force the issue, failed to keep pace with that one mid turn, pursued into the lane and faded. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , brushed at the
break, stalked the pace four wide, failed to kick on under pressure into the stretch and faded. GOLDEN GRANT dropped well back early on, raced off the
rail and never fired.

Footnotes
MAID THE JOURNEY , four wide entering the first turn, opened up on the backstretch, was slightly off the inner rail around the far turn, drifted out
approaching the sixteenth pole and twice switched leads in the drive while ridden out. JACK GAVE BACK , in the two path around the far turn, gained the
place. DR. FERBER , checked when getting out at the break, hugged the inner rail around the far turn and weakened. ALBERTANO , in close quarters
leaving the starting gate, was outrun, circled the far turn three deep then faltered. STRAIGHT UP GUY , three wide the first turn, raced along the inner rail
on the far turn and faltered. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , always well off the inner rail, stopped.

Footnotes
DECOUPAGE , four to five wide tracking a contested pace, came under pressure mid turn, closed in under a drive to engage BACI past the eighth pole,
secured command a sixteenth later then drew clear while kept alert. BACI , with the pace three deep and under rating, applied more pressure past the five
sixteenths, responded when set down in upper stretch and struck the top, kicked clear with a furlong remaining then gave way grudgingly. LITTLE MS
SCARLET had speed then was eased back off the leading quartet, saved ground in a perfect spot leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, had a
seam to go through leaving mid stretch but only mustered up a mild kick. JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT disputed the pace between rivals, stayed on to battle past
the three sixteenths then gave way stubbornly in the final seventy yards. MY LOVELY GIRL took over inside rivals in the opening furlong, was hounded by
rivals to her outside, ceded command in upper stretch, kept on willingly to about the furlong grounds then weakened. RUTABAGA angled in some early and
raced well off the pace, swung about six to seven wide for the drive but lacked a bid. AWESOME VIEW , fidgety in the gate, was unprepared as the gates
opened, edged up a bit off the inside, remained wide for the drive, gave way and was eased in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
MISTY TASTE stalked the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, found room inside horses through the stretch, bid near the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. DARIA'S ANGEL , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, angled to the four path turning for home, drifted out near the
eighth pole, challenged for the lead outside foes and flattened out. FOGGY DREAMS showed speed, raced in the two path approaching the turn, came in
on DULCE KIARA entering the turn, was well off the rail in the stretch, remained on her left lead and tired. FOLLY , a forward factor three deep on the turn,
failed to rally in an even effort. DULCE KIARA , close up down the backstretch, hugged the inner rail approaching the stretch and clipped heels with FOGGY
DREAMS when that one came in entering the turn. PRINCESS GEORGIA , five wide leaving the turn, was never a factor. Following a stewards' inquiry and
an objection by the rider of DULCE KIARA, FOGGY DREAMS was disqualified and placed fifth.

Footnotes
FLY ME HOME cleared early, dictated the pace towards inside, opened up after being roused in upper stretch and maintained a safe margin while solidly
hand ridden to the wire. HOLLYWOOD WALK , taken to rate early, advanced to the inside of a rival mid turn, angled four wide for the drive and rallied. GIO
MARIA rated outside a foe early on, came wide for the drive and finished with interest. ASHARA stalked two to three wide, was under pressure chasing into
the lane and faded. LOOKS DON'T LIE saved ground and have a mild response. FORETELL , bumped at the break, steadied soon after, angled out and
had belated action. PRINCESS PALMER came in at the break bumping with a rival and failed to menace. LONG DISTANCE PASS , bumped at the break,
steadied in the opening furlong, angled wide, faltered and was eased late.

Footnotes
PROPER ATTIRE sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and pulled away under hand urging. BUFF MY BOOTS prompted the pace outside
the winner around the turn and weakened through the stretch. RUNUP lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the four path in mid
stretch, flattened out, fell past the finish, got up, walked onto the van and was vanned off. DARK HONEY , three deep chasing the pace around the turn,
weakened in the drive. BEHIND THE COUCH , outrun, drifted wide leaving the turn. Due to a malfunction, the fractions were hand timed but the finish was
electronically timed.

Footnotes
TEXAS TOWER tracked to the inside of a rival, eased out advancing into the lane, moved to command nearing mid stretch then shook clear late under a
drive. UNCLE JEROME cleared early and dropped in to set a rated pace, came two wide for the drive, ceded command past the three sixteenths, fought on
past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. ORO GRIS , off the pace two wide, edged up between runners into the far turn, angled out, circled four to
five wide and offered up a mild rally. AFTERMATH rated to the inside of a rival early on, moved between runners near the half mile pole, chased outside a
rival past the five sixteenths then flattened out. CLEVER BOB lacked speed, was sent up to the inside of a rival nearing the half mile pole, shifted out to
make a mild run around the final turn then failed to seriously sustain. SHANGHAI CANDY , three wide early, angled in and lacked a bid. KAZU stalked three
wide and tired around the final turn. NINETYNINE EXCUSES , five wide into the backstretch, raced forwardly for about a half mile then faltered.
