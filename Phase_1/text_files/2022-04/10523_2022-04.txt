Footnotes
ENGLISH CHALLENGE broke slowly, improved inside of foes into the first turn to a forward position just behind the pace setter, stalked under a snug hold
from the pocket, tipped outside of the leading pair turning for home, chased them while inching closer in midstretch, and drove past entering the final
sixteenth before clearing. HIGHER AUTHORITY set the pace while a bit off of the race, dueled inside of a bidding MISSISSIPPI around the far turn, clung to
a minor margin through upper stretch, but was outkicked by a wider bidder entering the final sixteenth, and fended off the aforementioned foe for place.
MISSISSIPPI pressed the leader from the outside, came under a drive to keep pace into the far turn, responded and led turning for home, battled with his
inner counterpart through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but lost momentum when asked to change leaders entering the final furlong, did so
awkwardly soon after, then was outkicked entering the final sixteenth, and lost in the place duel. IRISH DECLARATION broke a step slowly and trailed
around the first turn, improved inside of foes around the far turn, but lacked a rail kick while tentative to slip inside of foes at the furlong grounds, altered
course outside of them while flopping back to his left lead, and kept on for a minor share. EL FRANCO tracked forwardly placed two wide and between
horses, but chased from the four path while under strong urging around the far turn, and lacked to a bid. TILL THEN laid off of the pace in the three path and
made little impact. DUEL FUEL tracked in the four path, but faded in the five path around the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
CRACKALACKING pressed three wide, vied into the turn, assumed command under her own power at the five sixteenths pole, drew off when driven in
upper stretch, and was kept busy through the late stages. GRAND OAK (IRE) broke a step slowly, tracked while unhurried off of the pace in the two path,
picked up stride while surpassing outer foes passing the quarter pole, tipped three wide in the process, rallied to bid for place leaving the furlong grounds
while having many lengths to find on the clear leader, and cut into that foe's margin while clearly second best. SOMEBODYLOVESYOU vied for the lead
two wide and between horses, but quickly failed to match strides with her outer counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, vied for place through upper stretch,
but was outkicked for that position entering the final sixteenth. THATSHOWSHEROLLS vied inside of a pair of foes early on, proved no match approaching
the five sixteenths pole, vied for place through upper stretch, but gave way leaving the furlong grounds. YOU CHOSE WISELY lacked early speed and took
the turn in the five path while far back, mildly veered outwardly entering the lane, and moved up outside of foes. CATCHA LATER MO stumbled a few
strides out of the gate, came under urging in the four path while off of the pace and outside of foes into the turn, then failed to menace through the lane.
SHE'S JERSEY TUFF hesitated at the start then was slow into stride while many lengths behind the field, lagged behind into the turn, and surpassed tiring
ones in the lane without making an impact. LADY EVELYN CAN chased along the inside, but weakened. LOTTA MOSCATO stalked in the three path
around the turn, got floated to the four path passing the quarter pole, struggled to change leads despite rider encouragement to do so in upper stretch, and
faded.

Footnotes
STAGE LEFT set the pace while tugging a bit in the early stages, felt pressure from an outer LAFITTE'S FLEET around the turn, responded readily when
set down passing the quarter pole, shook away to a clear margin, held sway through midstretch as LOGICAL MYTH pursued, tired in the late stages
allowing that one to close in, but lasted to the wire. LOGICAL MYTH broke a step slowly, tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair at the
five sixteenths pole, took aim on the clearing leader in upper stretch, but hung on his left lead while failing to progress, changed over at the furlong grounds,
grinded away in the closing stages to attempt a late bid, but missed reeling the leader in. LAFITTE'S FLEET pressed the leader from the outside around the
turn, but yielded between horses at the quarter pole. CAVE HILL broke a beat slowly, trailed the field while saving ground around the turn, then improved
inside of rivals at the quarter pole, but failed to threaten the top trio through the lane. CARAMELITO chased three wide and between horses, but faded
around the turn. HE HATE ME stalked four wide, but tired turning for home.

Footnotes
LYRICAL POET set the pace while a bit off of the rail around the turn, shifted out to the five path passing the quarter pole to deter an outer bidder, tucked
back down after noticing an inner well traveling APACHE TEARS in upper stretch, got shaken up and set down to scoot clear at the furlong grounds, and
held firmly through the late stages. APACHE TEARS stalked along the inside, took aim with a rail charge while the leader shifted out passing the quarter
pole, but decided to alter course outside of that inwardly-shifting rival at the furlong grounds, and chased that foe thereafter to prove second best. FOLIAGE
pressed the leader from the outside while in the three path around the turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane while being floated to the six path, then
sustained his chase thereafter to prove best of the rest. ROCKSTAR RO tracked in the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on
without menacing. SUPER DESIGN laid off of the pace in the three to two path, then came into the lane between horses, and failed to threaten. READY TO
ANSWER settled far back in the two path, shifted out to the seven path entering the lane, but only produced a mild kick. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE broke
slowly, then got outrun. CHIEF HOWCOME hopped at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. LOMU tracked in the four path, but faded.

Footnotes
PLIANTLEA raced in the two path along the first turn, tracked the early pace, was in the two path along the far turn, in the four path into the lane, made a bid
down the lane three wide, had a late kick and drove past in the final stages. WAYWARDNESS set the pace early on, raced in the two path into the lane,
inched clear in the stretch but was caught in the final stages. RHUBARB MARTINI raced in the three path along the first turn, pressed the pace while two
wide, was in the three path through the far turn, continued to bid in the stretch but weakened late in the drive. BITTER VIXEN came out and was bumped at
the start, stalked the pace early along the inside, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch run. WORLD PARTY raced in the four path
along the first turn, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and lacked a late bid in the stretch drive. LA NEBLINA trailed the field early on,
raced on the inside along the far turn, shifted into the four path entering the lane and moved up in the stretch run. GORILLA GIRL raced in the two path
along the first turn while back early on, was in the four path along the far turn, fanned into the seven path entering the lane with no rally down the lane.
SIMPLY BEGUILED was never a threat. BIG BUGG'S GIRL was done early. LA TOURISTA raced up close early on, was roused nearing the far turn and
lacked any response.

Footnotes
PISTOL was bumped at the start, pressed the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, under a long drive down
the lane, inched clear and held off rival in the final stages. HOT ANNA broke out at the start, chased the pace early, raced in the four path along the turn,
was in the six path into the lane, made a bid four wide near the three sixteenths pole and was gaining in the late stages. WATERMARK set the pace early,
raced in the two path along the turn, was in the three path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and yielded in the late stages. QUEEN CORDELIA
stalked the pace early, was on the inside along the turn, raced in the five path into the lane, made a bid three wide in the stretch but flattened out late in the
drive. KISS THEORY raced back early on, was in the three path along the turn, in the five path into the lane with no late gain in the stretch run. SUPER
SURGE was never a threat. SHADY was never a factor. I'M STYLIN bobbled at the start and was never a factor. OUT OF THE SILENCE was through after
a half. BACKYARD HEN steadied along the backstretch from the inside. DOGWOODS BECCA was a bit slow at the start and trailed the field throughout.
