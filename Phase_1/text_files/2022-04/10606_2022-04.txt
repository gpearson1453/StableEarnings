Footnotes
GUANAJUATO dueled for the lead on the outside in the early going, took command after a furlong, continued to show the way while saving ground around
the turn, and drew off to the wire while drifting out in the final furlong. CECE WAVE dueled for the lead on the inside through the opening eighth of a mile,
dropped back to chase the leader up what remained of the backstretch, began a bid from the two path around the turn and could not go with the winner,
chasing that rival home. SUPER ET tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. TRINITY HOPE
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, and finished evenly while never
threatening. BAD GAL RIRI trailed the field in the opening stages, made a mild improvement of position while saving ground around the turn and flattened
out in the stretch. DAVE'S RONDA swerved sharply to the inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn
in the two path, and made no bid.

Footnotes
LUNDI led the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground around the turn and drew off down the lane to win handily. ST BASIL chased the leader on
the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and continued pursuit of that rival to the wire, the best of the rest. BLAZING CHARLIE
stalked the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and chased the winner home, finishing evenly. CLEVER
PRINCE raced at the back of the pack on the inside in the early going, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and continued to gain
ground late. P T'S FLASH trailed the field on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and improved position in late
stretch. WESTERN STAR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly.
SHADY MONKEY tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired in the final furlong.
ZION'S CALL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two and three path and weakened in the
stretch while drifting out mildly. DAVES FRIEND DEWEY raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path,
improved position mildly in upper stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. RICHARDS DREAM raced off the pace on the outside in the early going,
came around the turn in the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
ABSOLUTELY angled in to show the way from the two path around the first turn, continued to lead the field while saving ground up the backstretch and
around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive. MS. CAJUN QUEEN bumped with the horse to her inside leaving
the gate, raced at the back of the pack in the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path, and
gained ground steadily on the outside to the wire, but was no match for the winner. TURF DANCER bumped with the horse to outside leaving the gate,
saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. SWIZZLECITY raced
in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing
in the four path around the turn and gained ground mildly in the stretch while never truly threatening. SARATOGA PASODOBLE raced in the three path
around the first turn, angled in to stalk the pace setter on the inside while racing up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the final
furlong. CZAR'S BALLERINA saved ground around the first turn, raced between horses in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, moved up while racing
in the three path around the second turn and flattened out in the stretch. THAT YOU MARGARET saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far turn, swung wide into the stretch and was empty on the outside from there. I GOT WINGS
raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and tired.
