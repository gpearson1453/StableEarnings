NY TRAFFIC set the pace in the two path while inside of a prompting LOBSTA, readily shook free of that foe passing the quarter pole, drew off under driving
pressure through midstretch, then was wrapped up through the final sixteenth. LOBSTA prompted the pace setter from the outside while intentionally
staying a path away from that rival, but failed to keep pace while hanging on his left lead through upper stretch, but remained clearly second best. REGGAE
MUSIC MAN bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside while a path off of the rail, but failed to keep pace with the top two in upper
stretch, tired through the final furlong, but lasted for show from a pair of pursuing rivals on either side. BANK ON SHEA bumped with an inner foe leaving the
gates, stalked two wide while in the three path around the turn, shifted outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch,
lacked a bid, and faded. HOLD THE SALSA was jostled and bounced around between horses at the start, lagged behind the field around the turn, then cut

Footnotes
SHAMALAMADINGDONG broke a step slowly before nudging an outer foe at the start, tracked along the inside, committed to a rail charge entering the lane
when the inside was vacated, surged through in upper stretch to drive clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway through the late stages. QUEEN OF LIES
dueled for the lead along the inside, but was taken firmly in hand at the quarter pole to back off and alter course outside of her outer counterpart, pursued
that foe entering the lane, got herded outwardly while attempting a rebid in upper stretch, but was outkicked by a rail rallying rival approaching the furlong
grounds, kept on while shifting ground inwardly through the final furlong, and chased the leader home. DREAM CENTRAL took a mild tap from an inner foe
at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, fanned five wide and among foes entering the lane, bumped with rivals on either side
approaching the furlong grounds, then was leaned on by an outer rival entering the final sixteenth, took bumps from that foe soon after while sustaining her
pursuit a tiring SHINFULL for show, and claimed that position late. SHINFULL sparred for the lead two wide, inherited a clear advantage entering the lane,
drifted out subtly in upper stretch as her prior inner counterpart reengaged from the outside, but proved no match for an inner bidding rival approaching the
furlong grounds, and tired while drifting in. TREAT STREET laid off of the pace three wide, swung six wide entering the lane, took a bump from an inner foe
in upper stretch, chased on her left lead thereafter, but leaned on an inner rival entering the final sixteenth, bumped that foe multiple times, and flattened
out. GIGGLING GHOST stalked along the inside, shied four wide entering the lane when QUEEN OF LIES altered out, but lacked a kick before being
herded into an outer rival in upper stretch, and gave way. LOLA LOLA hopped at the start, saved ground while trailing around the turn, but to no avail.
IMPAZIBLE DREAM stalked the pace, bore out to the center of the track turning for home, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
WE READY settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted off of the rail turning for home, split rivals four wide entering the lane, rallied in pursuit of a
bidding SEAN THE HAMMER in the final furlong, and reeled that foe in on the wire. SEAN THE HAMMER vied along the inside early on before backing off
to stalk into the turn, claimed place while taking aim outside of the clear leader in midstretch, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole, led leaving that station, but
met WE READY's challenge soon after, and got nailed at the wire. PRINCE OF FENTON stalked three wide, bid in the four path at the seven sixteenths
pole, cleared while well in hand turning for home, but began to tired in the final furlong, was surpassed entering the final sixteenth, and gave way. R BOY
CHEEKUM tracked from midpack in the two path, shifted four wide turning for home before being floated five wide entering the lane by the eventual winner,
and chased the leaders home. MISTER J T stalked in the three path, but failed to bid before faltering between horses in upper stretch. ROMANTIC MAN
took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, and failed to menace. HIT BY A WAVE vied two wide while striding with a highly held head carriage,
showed the way from an outer prompting foe while remaining in the two path into the turn, got headed by that rival at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened
between horses at the quarter pole. RAISING SAND lagged behind while taking the turn in the five path, and never got involved. VINNY TWO CENTS
bobbled at the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, but made little impact. DR. LEVY tracked four wide, chased
under urging from the five path around the turn, weakened turning for home, then was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS prompted the pace two wide, vied around the bend, dueled with her inner counterpart through upper stretch, exchanged a brush
with that one closing in on the furlong grounds, led at that junction, and edged away through the late stages. OFALLTHEGINJOINTS set the pace along the
inside, vied with an outer FREEDOMOFTHEPRESS around the turn, sustained the battle through upper stretch, but brushed with that one approaching the
final furlong, and was bested soon after. HALF BIRTHDAY tracked two wide, bid for show inside of CANDY MONET at the furlong grounds, dueled for that
position thereafter, and prevailed. CANDY MONET stalked three wide, ranged up to the leading pair turning for home, but failed to keep pace with them in
upper stretch, met HALF BIRTHDAY's inside show bid in midstretch, dueled with that rival thereafter, but was bested. APPRECIATE laid off of the pace
three to two wide and between horses, and failed to menace. BLIND SIGHT saved ground in midpack, but to no avail. WICKED HAPPY raced off of the
pace four to three wide, and made little impact. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE stalked along the inside, but caved in upper stretch, and was eased up through the
final furlong. BISTRITA trailed in the two path, and was outrun. WRITE THIS DOWN laid off of the pace two wide and between foes, took up amongst those
rivals at the seven sixteenths grounds, and got outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
MONTAUK DADDY dueled for the lead inside of QUALITY STONES early on, drew clear of that foe leaving the three furlong pole, widened under his own
power in upper stretch, and lasted safely while tiring in the late stages. SICILIA MIKE saved ground far off of the pace, then rallied along the rail in pursuit of
the clear leader, steadily narrowed that rival's margin through the final furlong, but was too late. FAST BREAK stalked in the three path, bid for place in
upper stretch, but was outkicked. WINNING DRIVE trailed two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and moved up. KAREN'S COVE took the
turn in the four path, shifted inwardly at the furlong pole, but failed to make an impact. QUALITY STONES dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner,
but proved no match for that foe passing the three furlong pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
SHESALITTLE EDGY vied two wide early on before clearing her inner counterpart at the nine sixteenths pole, tucked to the rail into the turn, felt mild
pressure from an outer prompting ROYAL MEGHAN, but shook away from that foe in upper stretch, drew off under driving pressure, and was ridden out
through the final furlong under consistent hand urging. ROYAL MEGHAN stalked three wide, pressed two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace with
the leader in upper stretch, and maintained place thereafter. LOVE AND LOVE vied along the inside early on, backed off to stalk at the nine sixteenths pole,
rated in the pocket around the turn, shifted three wide in upper stretch, but lacked a kick, and chased the top pair home. CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE laid off
of the pace in the two path, swung five wide in upper stretch, but failed to menace. FLASHNDYNAMITE tracked four to three wide, but failed to bid while
getting floated four wide in upper stretch, and yielded between foes at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
BOX OF JOE prompted two wide, bid entering the lane, led at the furlong grounds, drew clear, and lasted from an outer on-charging rival to the wire.
MIZTERTONIC broke in a tangle while brushing an outer rival, settled far back in the two to three path before swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied
with a good kick to take aim on the clear leader in the late stages, but did so belatedly. LUCA AT THE SPA saved ground far back, swung six wide entering
the lane, and stayed on to claim show late. RAW COURAGE set the pace inside of a prompting rival, resisted that foe's bid entering the lane, but was
headed at the furlong grounds, and weakened. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE stalked behind the leading pair while in the two path, shifted outside of them in
upper stretch while chasing, but faded in the final furlong. SELL SOMETHING leaned inwardly at the start, raced off of the pace three wide around the turn,
came into the lane four wide, but lacked a rally. SIXTY THREE S failed to keep pace with the main group entering the turn, raced far back two wide, moved
out seven wide in midstretch, and improved position outside of rivals. RED JET brushed the outer part of the gate at the start, took the turn in the two path
while off of the pace, shifted three wide entering the lane, but made little impact. KARMA'S WARRIOR broke a beat slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted
out in midstretch, and moved up. PEPPER KING saved ground in midpack, but faded. PERFECT BANKER brushed the outer part of the gate before being
bumped by an outer rival at the start, tracked in the two path, but weakened between horses approaching midstretch. ROYAL TIME bumped an inner rival at
the start, stalked three wide, then weakened between horses in upper stretch.
