Footnotes
BRAVO BRAVO broke well, cleared to the lead while racing keenly near the seven eighths, continued to set the pace while eager down the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, drew well clear of everyone except for GUN WAR who continued to give chase in
close range inside, but kept finding enough to hold that foe at bay. GUN WAR was keen inside while disputing the pace in the opening furlong, found himself
outsprinted from the seven eighths, continued to track the leader while racing inside, saved ground around the far turn while still tracking BRAVO BRAVO,
went to a drive inside into the lane, opened up on the rest of the field while still chasing BRAVO BRAVO, and kept on evenly to prove second best. DARE
GOES DA DEVIL settled at the rear, was pushed along in the three to four path around the far turn, swung into the stretch in the five path, drifted out slightly
further under a drive in upper stretch, proved no match for the leading pair but chased on mildly to prove best of the rest. SMOKEY SONG tracked the
leading pair two wide through the first turn, raced three wide with the tracking flight into the backstretch, was pushed along into the far turn while still tracking
outside of GUN WAR but soon outpaced by the leading pair, chased those foes in the three path on the far turn, and proved empty between horses in the
lane. BLOOMING GARDEN tracked the leading pair inside of SMOKEY SONG through the clubhouse turn, raced into the backstretch between horses in the
tracking flight, began to gradually flatten from the eleven sixteenths, raced along the rail with the rear flight around the far turn, was driven inside in upper
stretch and proved empty.

PRESIDENT ELECT trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, began a bid from the two path entering the stretch, gained ground
quickly on the outside down the lane and pulled clear. HIGH HERO pressed the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, took over the lead
while saving ground around the turn, was caught in the final furlong and chased the eventual winner to the wire. CONTRACTION hit the gate leaving it,
recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, could not go with the top two in late stretch and drifted out on the way
to the wire. W W KAN DO raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, began a three a wide bid passing the three eighths pole and
flattened out in the stretch. GREELEYS ICE chased the frontrunners up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and faded in the final furlong.

ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE was sent for speed inside but outsprinted to the lead by ULIKEAPPLES near the five eighths, tracked the pace inside from there,
encroached inside the pacesetter past the three eighths, was put in tight between ULIKEAPPLES and the rail approaching the quarter but appeared to
maintain momentum, chased the leader while racing inside in upper stretch, switched two wide midstretch, bid outside of ULIKEAPPLES and reeled her in
past the sixteenth. ULIKEAPPLES broke outward, was sent for speed and took the lead near the five eighths, set the pace in the two path on the turn, was
encroached upon from both sides around the bend, kicked clear of her foes in upper stretch, but was caught inside the sixteenth. MOMMASGOTTARUN
tracked the leading pair, was pushed along two wide into the turn, advanced to prompt the pace three wide past the seven sixteenths, was driven three wide
into upper stretch but outkicked by her other foes, and never found the needed rally.

Footnotes
AGAVE KID dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the frontrunner while saving ground around the turn, re rallied
approaching the eighth pole and gamely wore down his rival to get up just in time for the wire. DIVE DEEP dueled for the lead on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, took over while saving ground around the turn, continued to show the way in upper stretch, was collared by the eventual winner in
the final furlong and gamely dug in to duel to the finish but just missed. ONE WAY HOME raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going,
began a bid while saving ground passing the three eighths pole, could not keep up with the top two in late stretch and chased those two home, the best of
the rest. WINGING WAYS chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and was outkicked in the stretch
while finishing evenly. WILD WES raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground
around the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MORETHANSOULTITLE trailed the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, offered
a mild bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole and flattened out from there. EL MAS LOCO trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty in the lane. GOLDENPENCE raced in the middle of the pack

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S BIG WIN led the field under a hold up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and drew off to the wire, much the best. MISTER CHARMING raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, began a bid between horses
while racing in the two path around the turn, gained ground on the outside down the lane and just got up for the place. DEVIL'S RULE raced in the middle of
the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, was no match for the winner in the stretch and chased
that rival home, getting caught for second in the final jump. EMPTY HOLSTER was away from the gate a bit slowly, trailed the field on the inside in the
opening stages, made a mild improvement of position while saving ground around the turn, and faded in the final furlong. TUFF ATTACK chased the leader
up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and weakened between horses in tight quarters passing the eighth pole. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN
trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. CYCLONE
ATTACK tracked the leader on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SEARCH ENGINE broke well, tracked the pace two wide, was pushed along between horses in the three path into the far turn and bid between horses,
raced into the lane between horses in the leading flight, drove to a narrow lead past the three sixteenths, and kept finding enough to hold sway. LAVENDER
EARL chased outside of REGULAR GUY through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, took closer order past the nine sixteenths in tandem with
that foe, sustained that bid three wide around the far turn to engage outside of SPEED BOAT and SEARCH ENGINE past the three eighths, swung four
wide into upper stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, kept on with interest but could not reel in SEARCH ENGINE. SPEED BOAT was keen to the lead inside
and cleared into the clubhouse turn, continued on a clear lead down the back straight, was engaged near the three eighths while leading in the two path,
raced into the lane at the inside of the leading flight, was headed by SEARCH ENGINE past the three sixteenths, battled in close range past midstretch but
flattened out late. HAPPY CAMPER settled near the rear two wide, kept on unhurriedly in the five path on the far turn, floated out into the lane six wide, and
passed tiring horses. JUST GUN IT tracked the leader inside of SEARCH ENGINE, was outkicked by that foe and LAVENDER EARL into the far turn,
chased around that bend while saving ground, was driven inside into the lane, chased on to midstretch and flattened out late. REGULAR GUY was bumped
by TRIGGER HAPPY in the opening strides, chased midfield inside of LAVENDER EARL, was keen to take closer order between horses past the nine
sixteenths and made a brief bid, chased two wide around the far turn, and gradually flattened out in the lane. TRIGGER HAPPY stumbled at the start and
bumped into REGULAR GUY, was held near the rear inside while racing keenly, continued near the rear down the back straight, was urged into the far turn,
raced in the three to four path at the rear of the main group around that turn, and had no rally in the lane. DYNABLUE soon trailed, was driven in the four
path on the far turn, and offered no response.

Footnotes
NICE AND TRUE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, launched a four wide bid approaching the quarter pole, gained ground on the outside
down the lane and pulled clear late. HELEN MAE'S SONG dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle from
the rail in upper stretch, was caught by the eventual winner in the final sixteenth of a mile and chased that rival home. HER GOLD MINE stalked the leaders
on the outside in the early going, dropped back to race in the middle of the pack in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and
gained ground on the outside late. HEY HEY dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn
and into upper stretch, and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. ARCH FLYER chased the frontrunners on the inside through the opening quarter of a
mile, saved ground around the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. LADY ATLANTIC tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked in the stretch. SINGING ALLI raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, came
around the turn in the two path and was empty from there. BLUES MARY trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn
and made no bid.
