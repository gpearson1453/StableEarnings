angling out late with plenty left. SHELL FIRE raced evenly through the far turn emerging off a loose leader in upper stretch angling out toward mid track
there holding as a clear second best. ENJOY BASEBALL advanced on the backside giving chase through the far turn weakening on the outside in upper
stretch. HIGH POWERED slow early played no factor. INTENTIONAL WALK stalked through the backside then wilted on the far turn.

touch short. WWINSPIRED brushed with foe inside the five eighths pole chasing through the turn into upper stretch weakening late. CONSECUTIVE RUN
