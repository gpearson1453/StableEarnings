Footnotes
FIRST TO ACT bumped at the start by AUNT NAUGHTY, raced three wide in closest aim of that barn mate, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took
over narrow command swinging four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive tussling with AUNT NAUGHTY to the end and gamely inched away in the
late going. AUNT NAUGHTY broke out at the start bumping the aforementioned foe and came under coaxing to establish the front crossing to show the way
in hand along the inside, remained patiently handled under threat until placed to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got headed for the front spinning two to
three wide into upper stretch, dug in fighting on to the finish to be along clear for the place honors. LAKOTA SPIRIT coaxed from the gate, chased just off
the inside, tucked briefly inside near the half mile pole before tipping back to the two path through the turn, got placed to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths,
bid five wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages while well clear for the show honors. ST MAARTEN GIRL broke in a step at the start
brushing CULDEE, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and tired. JABBERWOCK four to five paths
off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing midway, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired.
CULDEE brushed at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
AL'S PRINCE bumped soundly with a rival at the start, went two then three wide around the first turn, was reserved on the outside in the middle of the field,
moved closer while three then four wide on the far turn, gained to make an outside bid into upper stretch, dueled outside of the runner-up from that juncture,
bumped with that opponent late and gamely prevailed. BAIL OUT went around the opening bend in the two path, settled while well placed in third position,
ranged up three wide on the far turn, took the lead at the quarter-pole then was put to a drive, dueled gamely inside of the winner from the three-sixteenths,
bumped with that foe late and was denied while well clear for the place. LEFT ON BOYLSTON saved ground around the opening bend, settled off the pace,
was urged along passing the half-mile pole, went around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch then moved further out in pursuit of the
top two and lacked the needed response while clearly best of the rest. KING OF STING ran-off with the rider during the warm-up and needed to be pulled up
by outrider on the backstretch, bumped soundly with a foe at the start, steadied off heels nearing the first turn, raced inside to the two path on that bend,
settled at the rear, was roused while inside to the two path on the final turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to respond.
AMERICAN DAY leaned out against the gate at the start, traveled around the first turn in the three path, settled near the back, was urged along in the two
path on the far turn and was no factor. GOOD TIP tugged his way forward passing the wire for the first time, contested the pace on the inside of a rival while
along the rail through solid fractions, dropped back while tiring in upper stretch and gave way. STRIKE PRICE was hustled from the gate, came off the rail
leaving the chute while going to the front, contested the pace on the outside of a foe in the two path, dropped back while shortening stride in upper stretch
and capitulated.

Footnotes
SHASTA STAR was hustled from the start then settled towards the back, went three wide early on the turn, commenced a rally between foes at the
three-eighths, gained while moving to the four path around the five-sixteenths, bumped with VIOLENT POINT while advancing at the quarter-pole, made an
outside bid at the three-sixteenths then took a narrow advantage, fought outside of two opponents in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under good
handling. BABA was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage under a drive in upper stretch, fought on gamely inside of two rivals in the final furlong and just missed while able to get the place. VIOLENT
POINT stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, bumped with SHASTA STAR at the quarter-pole, fought between the top two
in the stretch and missed while able to get the show. COVER PHOTO was rated off the pace, saved ground for most of the turn, shifted three wide while
roused outside the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and gained some while finishing willingly but missed the trifecta. WAIT A MINUTE
tracked the pace down the backstretch, drafted behind horses in the two path around the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under the crop in
upper stretch, moved out behind foes the vicinity of the furlong marker and weakened. GREATEST LOVE was taken under a snug hold early then rated on
the far outside, went four then five wide while asked on the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and came up empty.

NAKED ON THE BEACH tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped out
to the two path nearing the eighth pole and rallied with good energy to engage the leader running her down in the last jumps to the finish to prevail.
EXPAND THE MAP (IRE) established the front shortly after the start and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before tucking inside into
the backstretch, remained patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under growing
threat and was caught in the last jumps to the wire. LIBRETTO (IRE) just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors. CHARLEY RUDE coaxed from the start, raced forwardly placed just
off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. PRUNING bobbled at the break, tracked the front two to three wide from near the rear of the field coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home,
continued two to three wide into upper stretch and came up empty. Following an escort early to the gate to be loaded for an adjustment to the bridle, FLACA
raced three wide through the first turn, then chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
COLORMEPAZZI was hustled to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail around the turn, came under a right-handed crop in
upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and drew clear under strong urging. EXTREME was sent hard from the start, contested the
pace on the outside of a foe, vied in the two path around the turn, battled under a drive with the winner to the sixteenth-pole then weakened but held the
place. MAGNIFICENT CHROME was well placed just off the pace, came under urging in the two path around the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. BEZOS broke a step slow then was a bit slow into
stride, moved up under urging, saved ground early on the turn then shifted three wide, came six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.
CAJUN COMMANDER dropped back while urged along, saved ground through the turn and failed to threaten. JAKE ROCKS was hustled from the start,
chased the pace on the outside of a duo, went three wide around the turn, was carried five wide into upper stretch and tired. MR. BUCKLEY dropped back
while climbing some under urging, went three wide around the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE) was taken in hand early, saved ground around the opening bend, came off the inside on the backstretch, advanced closer
coming to the nine-sixteenths then dropped back just off the pace, moved in near the seven-sixteenths, drafted behind the leader while inside through the
final turn, came out some behind foes into upper stretch then was roused with clear room along the rail near the three-sixteenths, dropped in then came
through to make a rail bid outside the furlong marker, fought with the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under good handling. SO HIGH (GB)
went clear early, raced inside around the first turn, was challenged around the nine-sixteenths, vied inside on the far turn, was asked when confronted near
the five-sixteenths, responded well under heavy pressure in upper stretch, led determinedly into the final furlong then lost the advantage to the winner and
was outfinished but came home with good courage to get the place. EASTER (FR) was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went around the first
turn in the three path, settled at the rear of the field, was roused while three to four wide on the far turn, dropped to the two path outside the quarter-pole,
gained into the final furlong, moved out into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy to just miss the place while able to get the show. CONQUER
THE WORLD traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled outside down the backstretch, was urged two then three wide on the final turn, came five
wide into the stretch under a drive, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed kick. MICROPHONE (IRE) rounded the
first turn in the two path, followed the leader from second, moved up with nine-sixteenths to run, vied in the two path on the far turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, drifted out coming to the the furlong marker and was out-kicked. GHOST GIANT was taken in hand
early, raced in the three path through the first turn, was reserved on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, gained three wide on the far turn,
made a bid in upper stretch, was carried out into the final furlong and weakened. OLYMPIC ROMP rounded the first turn in the two path, settled on the
inside of a rival, was roused in the two path on the final turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
THISMIGHTBETHEONE broke out at the start bumping CADENCIA in tandem with ADAYDREAMBELIEVER, chased along the inside from just off the pace
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out a path straightened away and rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command just inside seventy yards to go, then inched away to the finish. CADENCIA got bumped between foes at the start
and came under coaxing, chased just off the inside down the backstretch in mid pack before tipping three wide into the turn, commenced a bid through the
turn into contention midway, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, dug in under threat and was caught in the final
seventy yards to the finish while clear for the place honors. MISPELLED MOOON broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way lightly coaxed
along inside, came under threat near the quarter pole and was roused taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and
weakened in the final furlong while clear for the show honors. SOLID TUNE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from three
furlongs out, spun three wide for home and improved position for the last major share. ROMA CARPE coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under
a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through to the finish. THISLADYIS THE LAW broke in at the start
and was corrected, chased just off the inside coaxed along from the get go, angled three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ADAYDREAMBELIEVER
broke in at the start bumping CADENCIA in tandem with THISMIGHTBETHEONE, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered
three wide into upper stretch and tired. TWENTY TWO ELLE shied in at the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DUSTED three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along midway on the turn, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and made no impact. DON'T BE CHEEKY broke three lengths slow and grew detached at the tail of the field just off the inside, tucked inside
