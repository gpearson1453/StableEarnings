Footnotes
DIVINING DANCER rated a slim lead inside, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole and came under pressure at the three eighths, contested the
advantage at the rail on the far turn, drifted into the lane but held on well under steady encouragement. MERCURY TEN settled off the rail on the opening
turn, bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and dueled clear for second later yards. SMOOZER raced off the early pace
about the three path, closed ground from the seven sixteenths pole and challenged, rounded the far turn about the three path then relented second later
yards. ZERO TO ONEHUNDRED broke awkwardly then stalked two deep, raced at even terms nearing the seven sixteenths pole and challenged from that
point, but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and weakened. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME saved ground, as did PALACE KING. This race was hand
timed.

Footnotes
MISS SEDUCTIVE stalked off the rail, bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep past the five sixteenths, contested the edge off the rail on
the far turn and dug in determinedly to edge clear of DEVILISH TRUTH through later yards, while the latter rated a short lead inside, came under pressure
toward the three eighths pole, gave up the advantage past the five sixteenths, though continued a close factor to mid-stretch before yielding; reluctantly.
CHANNEL SCENT rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane
while gaining on the runner-up. GOLDEN GLOW saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then weakened
inside the eighth pole. EL MILAGRA drifted to the five path on the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole then weakened in the five path of the
far turn.

Footnotes
TIZ THE REASON surged clear from the half mile pole and opened up a long early lead, came under pressure past the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on
the turn and was kept alert in the lane. MISS GRANDSTANDER became a bit anxious in the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the five path,
dug in leaving the turn and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. GRAM'S GAL chased the early pace outside, rounded the turn about the three
path and was outfinished for second the final sixteenth. REAWAKENED gave chase, ran in the six path of the turn and passed rivals outside. MOJO
MATTERS chased, ran at the rail on the turn and finished evenly to pass rivals. LA RUFINA chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail
then weakened. BRONZE DIVA became anxious in the gate, gave chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. LIL MISS FIBER
chased and rounded the turn about the four path. SINGING HARMONY gave chase, rounded the turn two deep then weakened. THISLILLIMEOFMINE was
not a factor.
