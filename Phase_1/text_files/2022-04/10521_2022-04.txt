Footnotes
THENORTHREMEMBERS settled off the early pace two wide, found room splitting horses in midstretch and edged away to the finish. SEIZE THE HAY
prompted LEASE from outside for six furlongs, reached a short lead turning for home, could not cope with the winner and held to be second best. PREFECT
saved ground on the turns in range, moved out widest for the drive and needed more. LEASE was fidgety in the gate and hopped slightly at the start, went
up to take command first time through the stretch, showed the way inside for six furlongs, and weakened once displaced up front. HAIL TO THE CHIEF
raced three wide on the turns, and faded in the stretch. AL HILAL lunged at the break and was away slowest, and remained in arrears. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

GIRL BYE set the pace in the two path and drew off under a mild drive. QUEENZY bobbled at the break, steadied off heels not long after, advanced along
the rail around the turn and ran on to be clearly second best. KRAZYKATKOUSIN pressed the winner from the three path, could not keep pace nearing the
lane, continued on the left lead in the stretch and held third. OLGA failed to menace while racing two wide. STEPHANIE'S CHARM played no factor while
racing three wide. JELLYBEAN was outrun while racing five wide. IMPERIOUSLY broke a bit awkwardly, raced four wide and made little impact. REGAL
BEGINNING had brief speed four wide.

outfinished for the runner-up spot. ENSIGN PARKER pursued the winner from outside to the stretch, and faded. VIVE BIEN showed nothing trailing outside.

Footnotes
MORNING COLORS set the pace along the rail, drifted out leaving the quarter pole, dug in outside of DIVINE EXCHANGE through the final sixteenth and
held firm. DIVINE EXCHANGE settled off the pace along the rail, advanced inside around the far turn, bid inside of the winner in the lane but could not quite
get past. WINTER PRINCESS stalked the pace two wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn then was one-paced through the lane to
maintain the show. ALPHA BABE steadied early, raced in range three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. PANOTTI trailed in the two path early,
went four wide around the far turn and passed some tiring rivals in the lane. LA COSTA chased the pace two wide and faded through the stretch. KATZ A
DREAM saved ground in range early, bid two wide between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole but tired soon after.

Footnotes
OMIXOCHITL took the early lead inside, got hooked by CHACALOSA coming off the first turn, vied inside that rival through the middle stages, regained
command a quarter-mile out, spurted away into the stretch and remained clear under a mild drive. ANADOR (FR) saved ground covered up behind the
leaders to the stretch, and finished willingly while unable to seriously menace the winner. KEEN KINGDOM broke a step slow, raced three wide on the turns,
loomed outside the leaders at the top of the stretch, but was outkicked from there. LADY PUCHI went along in the two-path for six furlongs, swung four wide
at the top of the lane, then flattened out. CHACALOSA went up outside OMIXOCHITL to take a short lead up the backstretch, could not match strides
turning for home and gave way. QUEEN CAMILLA trailed inside. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

GREEN UP raced with the pace outside for six furlongs, took over three to four wide roused past the quarter-pole, opened up through midstretch and was
geared down by the sixteenth-pole. PEACHY WEACHY advanced on the turn, reached the front with a rail bid near the five-sixteenths, proved no match for
the winner turning for home and ran on best of the rest. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO vied up front early, could not handle challengers on either flank after six
furlongs, and faded while able to salvage the show spot. EASY COME EASY GO was no menace two to three wide. BLUSTERY failed to factor three to four
wide. SURREAL FANTASY bobbled at the start, showed early speed outside, dropped far back after six furlongs and jogged in.

Footnotes
CREATIVE GIRL set the pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, steadily drifted out under right-handed urging and lasted. KODAMA (IRE) stalked
the winner two wide, could not quite match strides in upper stretch then gained outside of the drifting winner late. POIEMA stalked the pace inside, angled
three wide near the quarter pole and stayed on to hold the show. STRATEGY QUEEN checked entering the turn, saved ground and had a mild rally. THE
CLUB broke awkwardly, raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. BABY'S DIALED IN chased the pace three
wide, came five wide into the lane and lacked a closing bid. LI LI BEAR was outrun while racing two wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED WITH THE
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
