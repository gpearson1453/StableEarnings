Footnotes
URKILLINGMEBETH saved ground on the opening turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and steadily improved in the three path of the far turn,
drifted leaving the turn but dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. TOY TIGER stalked the early pace off the rail, dueled to the front past
the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was caught mid-stretch, flattened the final sixteenth and just lasted for place. KEEN MACHINE raced
well off the early pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, finished well and just missed place. MY
EXPENSIVE GIFT saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. CHRISTINE'S
COSMO rated close to the early pace inside, bid at the rail leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the lane. WHYCANTTHISBELOVE set the
early pace, was caught past the three eighths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
BONNIE BLUETOOTH broke in to make sharp contact with Hook The Chain then settled off the rail, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn about the three path, drifted outward while taking a slim lead entering the stretch then dug in to duel clear later yards. EX RATED stalked from the three
path the first turn, took the lead into the backstretch and dueled at even terms, drew clear approaching the quarter pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, was
headed into the lane but remained close to mid-stretch before relenting. HOOK THE CHAIN was jostled sharply then pinched back at the break, saved
ground into the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail and came along for third two deep approaching the head
of the lane. MAGNIFICENT ROCKET settled off the pace in the two and three paths the opening turn, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, ran three wide on
the far turn then flattened stride. CHOPRA rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked entering the backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
but weakened into the far turn. PROUDLY ELEGANT broke in to make sharp contact with Hook The Chain then angled to the inside to set the pace, was
met into the backstretch, dueled at even terms but dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter pole and weakened on the far turn. LADY SPARROW
raced inside and never factored. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Bonnie Bluetooth, lodged by the rider of Hook The Chain and
disqualified the former to third place for his part in the incident leaving the gate.

FAST LOADED rounded the opening turn in the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and took the lead five wide midway on the far turn, then dug
in determinedly to inch away from QUICK ENTRY, who rated close inside the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but was blocked at the heels of
Big Hambone past the five sixteenths pole, eased around that one leaving the quarter pole, dueled between horses two deep on the far turn and dug in
gamely to late stretch before relenting; reluctantly. FEDERALE raced with the early pace two deep then took a slim lead leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
dueled at even terms from that point but was caught in the three path midway on the far turn and flattened the final furlong. FRANKEE MERCH raced off the
rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and finished evenly to pass rivals. DARK AGES settled off the pace
inside, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn and showed little more. BIG HAMBONE broke awkwardly then rated
a slim lead inside, was met and dueled at even terms from the seven sixteenths pole, steadied at the rail nearing the head of the lane and weakened. ONE
MORE FACTOR rounded the first turn in the four path then stalked into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced close four
wide on the far turn but weakened leaving the turn.

Footnotes
STYLISH PAINT saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily progressed at the rail on the far turn, took the lead two deep
leaving the turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over the game stretch challenge of DUSTWHIRL WONDER, who was rated off the pace and off
the rail on the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and bid leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path, then outfinished in a
game stretch effort. EARNED THE SHOT saved ground, bid nearing the quarter pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for third inside the
sixteenth pole. HAD THE NOTION stalked from the three path the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the five path of the far turn, left
the turn outside and showed little more. JUST A BIT SASSY settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn about the four path, drifted toward the head of the lane and passed rivals. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG was shuffled back leaving the gate
and rounded the opening turn about the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole, eased to the four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane.
CENTERFOLD ANGEL stalked two deep on the first turn, took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths, rounded the
far turn near the rail, was met into the lane and weakened. GOLD AND STRIKE rounded the opening turn in the four path and stalked into the backstretch,
gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened. CATHERINES WARRIOR rated a slim early lead, came
under pressure and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, dropped back nearing the three eighths, checked at the rail toward the quarter pole and
gave way into the far turn.
