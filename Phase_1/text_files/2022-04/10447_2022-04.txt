Footnotes
MY PIE made the early lead edging clear on the turn moving to a commanding lead in upper stretch being ridden out. LATE DATE went evenly through the
turn rallying into upper stretch dueling inside of rival getting up for place. CABARET FLEUR hustled along chased through the turn battling abreast foe down
the lane holding well late. GIMME CLEARANCE slow early lagged to upper stretch picking up tired ones there. FOREVER FACTUM pressed then chased
on the turn tiring the final eighth. SASSY POWER played no factor. LEONA'S PROMISE gave way on the turn. LA TAINA was always outrun.
