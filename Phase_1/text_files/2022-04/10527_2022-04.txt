ROUSING RUBBLE pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command nearing the quarter pole and held gamely to be clear late under strong
encouragement. SMOOTH PAPA was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch and finished well to get up for
the place position late. TOP HAT HIGH JINKS stalked the top pair early, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. MONTANA
JACK was unhurried early, raced five deep around the far turn and moved up through the drive. LINEMANS CHECK was slow in the early stages, raced

Footnotes
BIG HEAT was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, took command through the far turn, drifted through the stretch run and was well clear late under
strong handling. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and was no match for the winner. HEART ON THE RUN
showed good early speed and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BLACK BELT GINNY was off slowly, raced near the inside through the stretch, lacked
room near the eighth pole and moved up late. BOOSICAL LADY was off slowly, raced towards the inside and had no response. LOTSA LACE raced three
to four wide in the lane and never was a factor. BONITA DIXIE settled off the early going, raced three to two wide in the stretch run and never threatened.
BAKERSFIELD BABE was fractious behind the gate, stalked the pace, lost his whip near the three sixteenths pole and tired.
