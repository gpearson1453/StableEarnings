Footnotes
KIRSTENBOSCH off a bit slow to begin then drifted out and bumped rival shortly after, pulled to the front and dueled inside ISOLA MIA for command, fought
head to head into and around the far turn, took control and cleared with a furlong to go, got pressured by RHEA MOON (IRE) late and held gamely to the
wire. RHEA MOON (IRE) broke out and bumped rival at the start, rated between foes early, went two into the far turn, tipped out and was driven three wide
into the stretch, showed late effort outside the winner but was not enough. TALENTED LADY got sandwiched leaving the gate, taken to the inside while
racing at the back, moved to the two path on the first turn, angled out in the stretch and put in a late bid to earn the show. ISOLA MIA got bumped shortly
after the start from inside, went up to duel for command outside of KIRSTENBOSCH, battled around the far turn and into the stretch, then faltered in the late
stages. DEAR BEAU (IRE) got bothered by inside rival leaving the gate, chased inside a pair of rivals along the rail, lost some ground up the backstretch,
remained inside to the stretch, moved out a bit in the lane, came back to the fence in the drive and got put in a bit tight late which halted her late momentum.
VIOLET STORM hit the gate when breaking out and came away awkwardly, settled inside near the back, angled three wide on the far turn, steered out in
the stretch and failed to menace. SWEET TALKED bumped from inside at the start, stalked three deep early, raced outside a rival three then four wide on
the far turn and weakened.

SWISS SWOO (IRE) got put in tight and checked between rivals early, angled down to the inside while off the pace, saved ground advancing through the
turn, steered out in the lane, rallied three deep and got up in time. SMILING GOODBYE sped to the front from inside, pressured by THIRSTY ALWAYS
around the turn, maintained a short lead into the final sixteenth and got nailed at the wire. THIRSTY ALWAYS raced up close outside the leader early,
headed SMILING GOODBYE midway around the turn, continued to apply pressured through the stretch, dug in late and got a bad bob between rivals at the
wire. PERFECTO AMOR dropped back early, navigated the turn three wide and showed a mild response to round out the superfecta. PRINCE MAGICIAN
broke well then chased the leader off the inside, rounded the turn four wide and faded. GATOR SHINING tracked two wide around the turn, three wide and
between rivals into the lane and weakened.

QUEEN OFTHE TEMPLE raced near the back outside a rival, took closer order in the middle stages, angled out and bid four wide into the stretch, gained
command in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong left to run, drifted to the rail and drew off. CARROLL GIRL stumbled a bit and jumped the track crossing
onto the turf shortly after, raced up close in the two path, bid two wide around far turn, took a short lead at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command in upper
stretch and stayed on to secure the place. EXIT SOUL sped to the front from inside, show the way up the backstretch, lost command midway around the far
turn, churned on through the lane and outkicked ADELIE (IRE) for the show honors. ADELIE (IRE) settled early and tucked inside on the first turn, moved
closer up the backstretch, tipped two wide on the far turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and got edged for the show. ROCK THE BOURBON hustled
from the gate then got shuffled early, steered to the inside, trailed into the far turn, moved off the rail and came three wide into the stretch and made no
impact. SUNNY MORNING (FR) broke a step slow and was hustled briefly, pulled through the early stages and up the backstretch, bid three deep on the far
turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
BIG HAND prompted the pace from outside, headed rival midway around the turn, grabbed the lead exiting the bend, disposed of GRAZEN SUN in upper
stretch under right-handed urging and drew off under strong handling. HEAVEN'S MUSIC off alertly in the beginning, chased the speed from between rivals,
got put in tight by TORRID TOMMY and checked early on the turn, angled down to the rail around the bend, tipped out in the lane and bested the rest.
GRAZEN SUN went up to take command, set the pace with company alongside, held a short lead through the turn, lost command in to the stretch, drifted
inward in upper stretch and flattened to third. TORRID TOMMY was off a bit slow to begin, was rank behind rivals and checked early, became hard to
manage again entering the turn and had to check once more, spun three wide into the lane and flattened out. LIMITED HEATWAVE trailed early well off the
rail, rounded the bend four wide and was not a factor. MAGNIFICENT RIDE broke well from outside, forwardly placed early outside a pair of rivals, exited
the turn four wide and faded out of contention.

CLAMPETT stalked PAPALE in the two path early, bid outside past the three-eighths pole, took over late on the far turn and edged away from PAPALE in
the final sixteenth. PAPALE sped to the front from inside, took pressure on the second bend, lost the lead leaving the turn, stayed on from inside and
secured the place. BRIGHT LEAF off slow to begin, traveled four around the clubhouse turn, chased three wide into the lane and finished willingly outside
the top pair for the show. BUD KNIGHT was rank three wide early on the first turn, steered down to the inside around the bend, moved into striking position
inside a rival, dropped back around the far turn and lacked a late rally. SALTO DE TIGRE settled on the inside near the back, coaxed along up the
backstretch, came out on the far turn and exited the bend five wide and failed to menace. ONEPARTICULRHARBOR was off a bit slow to begin, went three
wide into the turn then angled out a bit further around the bend, continued wide around the far turn, entered the stretch four to five wide and came up empty.
MONGOLIAN FORD chased three wide around the first turn, asked four then three wide on the second turn, entered the lane two wide and tired.

Footnotes
FUNKENSTEIN tracked the pace off the rail, got blocked behind ERIK THE VIKING early on the turn and had to check at the three-eighths pole, shifted to
the inside and saved ground to the stretch, bid inside BESAME MUCHO past the eighth pole, quickly took over and inched away. BESAME MUCHO vied for
the lead from inside then cleared approaching the half-mile pole, showed the way two wide into the stretch, lost the lead in midstretch and stayed on well to
prove second best. CONUNDRUM broke out and bumped rival, sat off the pace early on, went outside rivals into the turn, came four wide into the stretch,
finished willingly in the final furlong and was a clear third. LITTLE MISCHIEF away quickly in the beginning, vied for command three deep but could not keep
up with BESAME MUCHO nearing the half-mile pole, chased that rival four then three wide around the bend and weakened. THE BOSS HARTY climbed
early before settling into stride and moving into range up the backstretch, took aim at the leader two wide into the stretch, made light contact with LITTLE
MISCHIEF at the top of the lane and weakened. ERIK THE VIKING got bumped from inside at the start, vied between for the lead early, could not keep up
with the leader approaching the half-mile pole, dropped back three, four, then five wide on the turn and tired. COME ON COME ON broke out, went up to
challenge four deep early but could not keep pace past the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and tired.
