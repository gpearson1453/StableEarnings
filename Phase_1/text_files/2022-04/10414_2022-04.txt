GO STELLAIRE unhurried early, closed willingly three wide through the stretch under right handed urging and got up in the final strides. EASY EYES
stalked the pace three then two wide into the stretch, made the lead, shook clear and just missed hanging on. MISS SURPRISE away alertly, set a
pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was outfinished. READY TO PLAY pressed the early pace two wide then faded. NATALIA'S TEMPLE
failed to menace. PREFER DIAMONDS trailed.
