Footnotes
CINDY'S G MAN broke inward and lightly bumped J J'S SOLUTION in the opening strides, soon cleared, edged further away in the two path on the turn,
opened up further under a mild hand ride midstretch and was wrapped up late. B G ATTACK settled near the rear inside, began to improve up the rail from
the three eighths, passed most of the rest of his rivals inside in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but kept on willingly for the place. INSIDE THE
CIRCLE tracked the leader down the backstretch, chased him in the three path on the turn, was driven between horses past the quarter, and kept on mildly.
J J'S SOLUTION was bumped lightly by CINDY'S G MAN in the opening strides, settled between horses in the rear flight, raced in the three path in the rear
pair around the far turn, angled inside in upper stretch, was driven near the three sixteenths, and improved position mildly past tiring foes. GREAT PLAINES
chased outside of INSIDE THE CIRCLE down the backstretch and in the five path on the turn, went to a drive approaching the quarter and weakened.
DREAM ATTACK settled at the rear well off the inside, trailed in the seven path on the turn and mustered no rally.

Footnotes
CHICKADEE brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, was hustled to the lead up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in
the two path around the turn, turned back a challenger in upper stretch and maintained a comfortable margin to the wire under a drive. CHINA STAR chased
the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path, offered a bid approaching the quarter pole, could not
go with the winner and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. AMARI S. bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of
the pack up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on
the outside down the lane while no match for the top two. BELLS OF JOY chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved
ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. LEA'S DREAMER hopped up slightly and bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate,
raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the three path and came up empty in the stretch. RULER DAENERYS brushed
with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path
and made no bid. IRINA'S HERO trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and never fired. PIPPITY DO DA
tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
ON K P broke outward, set the pace while taking early pressure from TOM'S LAST GENERAL to his outside, cleared into the turn, set the pace in the two
path, cleared further under a hand ride in upper stretch, felt the right-handed crop as he drifted out late but won well clear. DYNABLUE settled near the rear,
raced in the three path on the turn, responded when urged in the two to three path in upper stretch, continued to run on under a drive from midstretch and
proved a clear second best. FROOME (IRE) chased the leading pair outside of TOUGH AINT ENOUGH early, chased in the three to four path on the turn,
swung out into the six path into the stretch, and kept on well enough to narrowly secure the show. TOM'S LAST GENERAL broke inward and grazed
TOUGH AINT ENOUGH, pressed the pace outside of ON K P in the opening furlong, chased the leader while racing along the inside on the turn, swung into
the lane in the three path and went to a drive, chased on while no match for the leader, and could not hold off FROOME for the show. WHERE'S LUCKY
hopped at the break and was slow into stride, trailed down the backstretch and while saving ground around the turn, raced into the lane in the three to four
path and lacked the needed rally. TOUGH AINT ENOUGH was grazed by TOM'S LAST GENERAL in the opening strides, chased the leading pair inside of
FROOME down the back straight, tracked the leading pair in the two to three path down the turn, was no match for the leader in the lane despite being all
out in the five path between horses, and weakened between in the final furlong.

Footnotes
WAY TOO SMARTE raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bold bid
entering the stretch and gained ground quickly from there to pull clear in the final sixteenth of a mile. FANCIFIED raced off the pace up the backstretch,
began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and continued to gain ground betweeen horses down the lane. ARCH FLYER pressed the
pace on the outside in the early going, dropped back to chase the leaders from the two and three path around the turn and finished evenly. NICE AND
TRUE dueled for the lead between horses in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened late.
CHECOTAH pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, took over a short lead while saving ground around the turn, dueled in upper stretch and
tired on the rail in the final furlong. AUTUMN ASPEN tracked the leaders between horses in the opening stages, raced in the three path around the turn and
came up empty in the stretch. DON'T HOLD QUEENS checked and was forced to steady leaving the gate, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch
and around the turn and made no bid. SHE'S A BIG STAR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the
three path, swung wide entering the stretch and tired on the outside from there.

Footnotes
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE was sent to the front, led narrowly outside of KHOZYS CROWN early, saved ground while just clear around the turn, was pushed
along in upper stretch and opened up on the field, and continued to draw off under a mild drive. KHOZYS CROWN attended the early pace inside of
DELIGHTFUL BREEZE, switched out and tracked that foe while positioned two wide on the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, continued to chase the
pacesetter under a drive in the lane, but proved second best. SENORITA AURORA raced at the inside of the chasing flight while well behind the leading
pair, continued patiently while saving ground on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, angled out when JANE'S GOLD TOUR angled inward in front of
her, and chased on mildly for show. JANE'S GOLD TOUR chased three deep well behind the leading pair early, chased the leading pair in the three to four
path on the turn, angled inward in upper stretch, went to a drive, and flattened out in the final furlong. TIME BREAK chased between horses early while
racing well behind the leading pair, continued toward the rear two wide on the turn and failed to muster a rally in the lane. SPECIAL CONQUEST settled at
the rear, trailed in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out and offered no bid. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THIS
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HONEY MUG disputed the pace between horses early, dueled inside of FIRST SQUADRON on the turn, drifted out from upper stretch but nonetheless
drew off under a mild drive. SEAWARD chased along the rail, began to improve into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch, kicked away from the rest of
the field nearing the sixteenth pole and proved a clear second best. MARYS LAST SONG was extremely reluctant to load, unseated the rider in the gate
before the break, settled near the rear, raced patiently in the three path on the turn, swung out near the center of the track in upper stretch, and rallied with
good late interest for show. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM chased the leading line early, continued to chase three wide between horses around the bend, came into
the lane four wide under a drive, chased on while no match for the top two, but was outkicked for show. BAILESTON LASSIE disputed the early pace inside,
proved no match for the leading pair into the turn, tracked the leading trio two wide on the turn, chased inside foes into the lane, chased on past midstretch
but was outfinished late. FIRST SQUADRON contested the early pace three wide, dueled outside of HONEY MUG around the turn, was carried out in upper
stretch when HONEY MUG drifted out, proved no match for her past the quarter pole despite going to a drive, drifted inward approaching midstretch, and
flattened between horses. SUNDAY SCHEMING broke near the rear but was urged for better position, improved to midpack, continued under strong urging
four wide in the chasing flight on the turn, swung out near the center of the track into the lane, chased on through midstretch but ultimately found no kick.
KIMBERLY FRANCES was slow into stride, raced at the rear through the opening furlong, continued near the rear in the three to four path on the turn, was
driven inside foes into the lane and lacked the necessary rally. GO STORMIN GIRL was sent to stalk the pace four wide, tracked three wide on the turn,
proved no match for the leaders approaching the quarter, floated into upper stretch in the seven to eight path, and proved empty between horses. SATIATE
settled near the rear early, was outpaced from near the nine sixteenths, raced in the two path on the turn and offered no bid. THE TRAINER OF
BAILESTON LASSIE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HONEY MUG, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.
