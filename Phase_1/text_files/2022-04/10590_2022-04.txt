EASY EYES with the second flight into the turn, closed with a rapid response three wide entering the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and
won under brisk handling. BLACK KETTLE broke in front, set a pressured pace two wide then along the inside but was no match for the winner in the final
furlong. LILAC LACE was bumped at the start, matched strides for the early lead along the rail, checked entering the turn, dropped back then came on again
late. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL close up along the rail, shifted out to the two path while steadying a bit entering the turn, swung out to the six path entering the
stretch and closed ground late. BLACK BUTTE hopped outward bumping LILAC LACE at the start, offered a mild bid three wide into the turn then came up
empty. WOLF EYES trailed

GONE IN A FLASH unhurried early, angled out on the turn, circled rivals five deep and was along in time. KID RUSSELL pressed the pace three wide, drew
on even terms for the lead in deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. MUTINY dueled for the lead along the inside until deep stretch and was
outfinished. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS close up near the inside, advanced through upper stretch, lacked room, altered course outside and finished
determinedly. COUNTRY RUCKUS battled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then was outfinished. RED HOT POWER with the second flight between
horses, failed to respond. OHIO CAUSE with the second flight three wide, faded in the stretch. HAPPY TAKEOVER trailed.

Footnotes
QUIET AMIGO rushed to lead along the rail before a quarter, set a pressured pace into the stretch, drifted to the middle of the racetrack and prevailed under
right handed urging. QUIMBY unhurried early, closed fast along the inside and got up for second. TRAITOR AMONGST US had good early speed three
wide, shifted out four wide on the turn, also drifted to mid track and finished with good courage. TALE OF LACEY went evenly. KINGDOM DIAMOND failed
to menace. GIV'EM THE BIZ pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened. FOREIGN battled for the early lead three wide, had speed into the
stretch then was used up. SWEET JILL'S JACK trailed.
