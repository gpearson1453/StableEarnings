HANDS DOWN tapered in and rated a short early lead just off the rail, came under pressure at the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily encouraged to hold on. LUNAR IMAGE saved ground off the pace, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, progressed at the rail on the far turn and
finished well while gaining on the winner. TOMMY PIES stalked off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, but dropped
back at the quarter, rounded the far turn off the rail and flattened in the lane. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR settled back in the three path the first turn, eased
out into the backstretch and started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path then flattened the final sixteenth.
BONEYARDHOLLER rated close to the early pace inside then steadied at the rail into the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn about the three path then flattened stride toward mid-stretch. RUN RABBIT stalked inside then eased outward leaving the first turn, gave chase past
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. EXPLOITATION settled off the rail the first turn then faded through the

HARDLY EVER BETTER was hustled to the front past the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, drew clear leaving the turn and was steadily
handled through the lane. MYSTIC O'SHAUNESIE angled in to give chase, rounded the turn near the rail, dug in leaving the turn and came between horses
mid-stretch while dueling for second. NEEDNOEXPLANATION chased the early pace toward the outside, rounded the turn about the three path then
outfinished in the later duel for second. TWILIGHT YEARS angled to the outside to give chase, rounded the turn about the five path, drifted leaving the turn
then finished evenly to pass rivals. CATS DIAMOND BOY broke clear then gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued close two deep on the
far turn but dropped back into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. JUBA JUNIOR gave chase inside and rounded the turn near the rail. QUIET
JUSTICE gave chase and rounded the turn near the rail.
