SEB'S WELCOME (FR) and another rival hallanged each other from the start, exchanging leads along the way in a closely group of contenders, the two
front runners were not giving up any groung, they both rallied up the hilll with neither rival giving way .with two fences to go, they jumped the last as a team
and dueled all the way to the wire with SEB'S WELCOME getting the nod at the wire.ONDALOVE challanged the winner from the start, The two rivals were
always within a lengh of each other, testing there jumping ability at every fence, neither opponent gave an inch and jumped the last as a team, battled hard
through the stretch and he just missed at the finish. HARD GAME lagged early but was always in strking distance, rllied up the hill and over the last two
fences then weakened in the late going. MASTERFUL TOUCH was well placed in the early going, but failed to respond when called upon. FIDDLYN raced
mid pack and was in striking distance until they headed up the hill for the final time then tiired. and was pulled up before the last jump and walked off.

Footnotes
MR.BRIDGER was always in contention, rallied up the hill to gain command heading for the seocnd last, still had the advantage jumping the last and drew
clear through the stretch run. CRITICIZE was unhurried in the early going, started to close the gap going down the backside for the final time, rallied after
the second last to track the leader over the last fence then flattened out through the lane. EMBRACE THE GRIND had command for the first mile and a half
then relinquished that position heading into the home turn, then flattened out from there but made a game effort to hold on to the third spot.
GHOSTLIGHTER was in contention until they headed up the hill for the final time then started to back up. BELLA COOLA raced towards the back and failed
to menace. EVE'S CITY was in contention down on the inside and mad a horrible blunder at the last losing her rider and walked off. ISLAND NATION (IRE)
trailed through out and was pulled up before the last jump and walked off.

CHIEF JUSTICE (G) was in no hurry for the first mile, then took over the lead, controled the pace on the front end, still had a clear advantage heading to the
last, then widened that margin through the lane. BRIANBAKESCOOKIES drafted the leader throughout but failed to respond when called upon. RAZOUL
(IRE) was never a threat here. MIGHTY MARK pulled up with a circuit to go and was vanned off.

SEMPRE MEDICI (FR) stalked the leader for most of the way, rallied up the hill after the second last, came on the inside approaching the final obstacle,
after the last collared the leader, dueled through the stretch and wasn't to be denied. COURT RULER (IRE) showed the way until after the last fence, then
dueled with the charging rival through the stretch and just mist at the wire. BULLET STAR settled in third position but wasn't that far out of it until a major
blunder at the last almost losing her rider and all momentum.
