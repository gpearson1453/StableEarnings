and proved no match while producing a solid effort. HENRY D broke in, a bit awkward in his actions, looked to buck a couple times early and finished ok
when finally leveling and galloped out well. EASE DOWN FIRST away cleanly, steady right hand urging and failed to make up ground in a even effort. THE
TRAIN STATION away cleanly, failed to accelerate well enough to stay in contention and lacked rally under a hand ride.
