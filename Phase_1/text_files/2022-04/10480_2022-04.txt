HOOK THE CHAIN raced hemmed in entering the first turn then settled close through the turn, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, contested close
three wide on the far turn, took over past the eighth pole and edged clear inside the sixteenth. OFFICER SLEW came away a bit awkwardly then rated a
slim lead inside, was met leaving the nine sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested at a close disadvantage into the far turn, recovered the nod
nearing the head of the lane, was caught past the eighth pole but held on for second. TAPTAP stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, moved
to even terms leaving the nine sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, had the advantage two deep into the far turn but was caught toward the eighth
pole and flattened the final sixteenth. LIL PERFECT rounded the first turn about the three path, bid into the backstretch, raced at the rail on the far turn and
showed little more. MEDAL GENIUS settled back off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn.
IHEARTRAINACOMN rated off the pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. NOT FOR ME saved
ground and showed little response. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE rounded the first turn in the three and four paths, left the turn outside and showed little
response.

MISS WAVE stalked from the three path then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, took the lead two deep past the quarter and was steadily handled
through the lane. PETTIGO GIRL raced boxed in off the rail early and rounded the opening turn about the three path, started a bid toward the seven
sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and ran evenly in the stretch. HOLLY'S PERSUASION steadied at the break and rounded the
first turn in the four path, left the turn toward the outside and gave chase from that point, ran in the five path of the far turn and finished evenly to pass rivals.
TRUMPET LILLY came away a bit awkwardly then stalked two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened
inside the eighth pole. SARATOGA BEAUTY bobbled leaving the gate then rated close inside the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and weakened in the stretch. UNCAPTURED RUBY showed little response through the backstretch.
DISCREETLY TOUGH mostly saved ground. MENDING rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught past the
quarter and gave way at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
JUNGLE BEAST rounded the opening turn about the three path then bid into the backstretch, took a slim lead toward the quarter pole, raced at even terms
off the rail through the far turn, then dug in determinedly to eke out the edge over the game challenge of SHAMELESS RISK, who stalked from the three
path, bid nearing the three eighths pole, dueled between horses to the mid point of the far turn and dug in gamely to the finish. CANDY INVASION eased
outward on the opening turn and started an outside bid leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third
mid-stretch. SPUNMAN rated close inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, though showed little more.
SPANGLISH took over at the three quarter pole and rated a slim early lead, was met at the nine sixteenths pole, dug in from the three eighths but was
caught at the rail approaching the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. TOWERING CHANCE rated close inside, moved to even terms at the
nine sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the three eighths and faded approaching the far turn. STRONG HEART stumbled at the break then saved
ground.

inside the opening turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled to the outside leaving the turn and finished
well to take third the final yards. C R'S MANDATE rounded the first turn in the four path, bid into the backstretch and took the lead nearing the three eighths

make contact with Talking Teddy and rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase leaving the turn, ran in the four path of the far turn but showed little
more. NOID broke inward and rounded the first turn about the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and weakened. JACKSON MAN broke in to make contact with Talking Teddy then saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the three and four paths and showed little more. CHARITABLY GIFTED angled to the inside to set the early pace, was caught
approaching the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point then weakened at the rail on the far turn. TALKING TEDDY was bumped between horses
leaving the gate, took a brief early lead while angling to the inside, though, faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
HINK'S PALADIN was brushed lightly leaving the gate then contested the early pace, took a clear lead and angled in past the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. HURRICANE AMIGO made light contact with Bought By Diva leaving the gate then gave
close chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail, was gaining late but ran out of ground. ASCENDED gave chase, rounded the turn
at the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. ROCKING TO HOME gave chase, ran in the three path of the turn and finished evenly. TEMPESTA gave chase
inside, angled out entering the stretch and ran evenly in the lane. BOUGHT BY DIVA was jostled mildly leaving the gate, gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. I WANT MORE gave chase, ran in the four path of the turn and was never a factor.
JUBA'S YANKEE ONE gave chase and rounded the turn about the six path.
