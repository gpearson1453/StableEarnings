Footnotes
ESTILO VARONIL broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch, then edged
clear in the final sixteenth under firm left handed pressure. THROWN FOR A LOUPE, urged to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage, dueled for command through the turn into the stretch but proved no match for the winner late. JACKSON STRONG settled in hand behind the
first flight outside a rival on the backstretch, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch but continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. LAST
INVESTMENT tracked off the first flight along the early, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch while being prompted to advance but had no closing
bid. TITHED settled into stride near the inside behind the second flight on the backstretch, switched out to the three path nearing the lane but lacked the
needed late response. EAGLE KEEPER trailed.

Footnotes
TOWERING GAZE, held up between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside nearing the backstretch while racing under rating, made a steady
advance inside foes nearing the far turn to close the gap on the pacesetter, tipped outside that foe to challenge for command racing into upper stretch,
wrested the advantage under firm right handed pressure and was taken in hand in the final strides. THUNDER BUGGY angled in sharply brushing
AWILDAS TREASURE while being urged to secure the lead along the rail racing into the first turn, dictated terms on a clear margin to the second bend,
shifted out a bit while being urged to resist the winner's bid racing into upper stretch but proved no match late. SPEED SALSA, caught four wide while being
urged to a contending position in the opening three furlongs, continued three deep in second flight racing to the far turn, lost ground to the leaders but
continued with a steady effort to earn a share. ASPROPODIA, reserved off the second flight racing in the three path to the backstretch, lacked a closing
response. AWILDAS TREASURE, brushed in the opening stages, switched out of close quarters while being urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter in
the two path to the backstretch, then emptied out racing into the far turn. KEITANY, urged to a forward placing three wide between foes racing to the
backstretch, emptied out early. TRULY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GUS K was rated just off the leaders while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, moved to challenge nearest the rail entering the far turn, was
taken back avoiding tight quarters midway through the bend, tipped out three wide nearing upper stretch, altered course four wide midstretch, produced a
solid late response to wrest the advantage in time, then was taken in hand nearing the wire. EL POLICIA broke awkwardly losing position to the field, was
urged to gain position between foes after a half, tipped three wide on the far turn while moving to challenge for command, gained the advantage nearing
upper stretch, lugged inwards crossing the winner's path entering the lane and proved only second best when confronted by that rival.
TAPINTOYOURBEER broke sharply, prompted the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes through the far turn, was brushed by the
winner entering upper stretch and proved no match for the top pair late while keeping on for a share. TELECAST, urged to a forward placing three wide
tracking just off the leaders, was fanned four wide racing into the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT, urged inside rivals
disputing the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command a bit off the rail racing into the far turn and gave way abruptly entering
the stretch. HEAVY WEIGHT was settled into stride along the inside and dropped out early. ZIPPER ZAPPER broke through the gate prior to the start,
necessitating his late scratch.

Footnotes
BABY BEE MERRY was urged to a forward placing along the inside tracking just off the leaders racing into the turn, was urged through close quarters to bid
for command along the rail in upper stretch and prevailed in time under firm handling. WEDONTBELIEVEHER was urged setting the pace along the inside
in the opening stages, dueled for command on the turn, then into upper stretch racing a bit off the rail, couldn't contain the winner late but edged a rival for
the place honors on the wire. LEA ME ALONE was rated off the first flight in the opening quarter, tipped out advancing to challenge three wide racing into
the turn, pressed the issue to strike the front midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. KENAI COOL broke sharply to gain terms with the pacesetter in
the opening furlong, was taken back off the leaders nearing the seven sixteenths marker, angled out to the five path racing into upper stretch and continued
with some late interest to regain some position. CLEM GEM settled along the inside dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, tipped off the inside
while being prompted to advance racing through the stretch and continued with mild interest. FOOLISH HEART bobbled at the start, was righted, then urged
prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch, lost terms with the leaders while shifting out four wide in upper stretch and faded late. TALE OF V K
balked in the post parade, threw her head while ducking out at the start and trailed throughout.

advance, moved to challenge for command in that path nearing upper stretch, shifted out under pressure in a prolonged drive but edged clear in time under
stout encouragement. BENCH WALK angled to the rail just after the start, was urged inside foes racing into the first turn to gain a narrow advantage, dueled
for command inside a rival through the backstretch into the far turn, kept on resolutely contesting the issue inside the winner past midstretch but proved only
second best. ECCENTRICO was settled last racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into the far turn while coming under pressure to advance
and edged a rival for a share in the closing stages while no threat to the top pair. SUMMER BOSS, prominent three wide in the opening stages, continued in

BARBARA ducked out slightly at the start, was urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, moved forward nearing upper stretch, forged
clear entering the lane and widened the advantage while being kept to some right handed pressure. FABULOUS PHILLY broke readily, was urged inside
the eventual winner disputing the pace through the backstretch, proved no match for that foe after a half but continued with interest to edge a rival for the
place honors late. BALLYMENA tracked off the first flight in the five path in the opening furlong, tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing into
the bend, was urged to advance in that path nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. HAPPY RIDE, off a bit slowly, was urged to contention
three wide between foes in the opening sixteenth, angled to the inside tracking the leaders as part of the second flight racing into the turn and steadily faded
nearing the lane. BEAUTIFUL ROSALIA, held up avoiding close at the start, settled well off the leaders on the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter.
LOVERS AT MIDNIGHT, forwardly placed four wide between foes in the opening furlong, shifted inwards to track the leaders between foes in second flight,
then gave way racing into the turn. CLASSIC REWIND ducked out at the start while losing contact with the field and trailed throughout.

ORIGO angled inwards in the opening stages while being rated between foes racing to the backstretch, pulled his way to contention in the four path racing
through the backstretch advancing on the pacesetter, moved to wrest the advantage in that path nearing upper stretch, shifted inwards entering the lane and
steadily widened the margin under a few right handed taps to prove best. ONE LUCKY DAY was rated tracking off the first flight while racing off the inside to
the backstretch, continued three wide nearing upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors in the closing stages. MEROKEE, urged forcing the pace
outside a rival racing in the three path into the backstretch, gained a brief lead after a half setting the pace in the three path racing into the far turn, proved
no match when confronted by the winner and gave way racing into the stretch. WILD IRISHMAN, off a bit slowly, was settled outside foes in the last flight
early, shifted inwards racing through the far turn to gain some position between foes in the closing stages and was taken in hand approaching the wire.
ONWARD AUSTIN, urged along the disputing the pace from the outset to the backstretch, gave way racing into the far turn. BALI BEACH was settled inside
foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. AGENT COOPER hopped at the start breaking last, settled between foes in the last flight and never
proved a threat.

Footnotes
ALL GOOD TIMES raced four deep to the first turn tracking the leaders outside foes as part of the second flight, steadily advanced in that path nearing the
far turn, bid for command three deep midway through the second bend, moved away to a clear advantage while shifting inwards racing into upper stretch
and held sway on a widening margin under energetic handling. MALIBU CURL, a bit restless in the gate prior to the start, tipped off the inside racing into the
first turn to track the leaders between foes in second flight through the backstretch, angled to the rail racing into the far turn while being prompted in pursuit
of the winner into upper stretch but was always only second best. AZURA settled outside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch,
continued five wide after a half, then raced four wide into the lane but continued well enough to gain a share. IRAZU was settled while angling to the inside
racing to the backstretch, saved ground throughout and made an effort to improve position entering the lane. IRISH DREAM GIRL sprinted to the lead while
angling inwards racing to the first turn, set the pace on a narrow advantage into the far turn while shifting off the inside to briefly resist the winner's bid but
gave way between foes racing into upper stretch. ROSE'S CAUSE angled to the inside in the opening stages while being prompted to a position in second
flight, switched out after a half to race three wide, then four wide into the far turn but offered no rally. TOOLEGITTOQUIT, forwardly placed prompting the
pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
TOURING EGYPT was rated tracking the pacesetter from well out of striking distance leading the second flight on a narrow advantage to the backstretch,
was prompted to advance in tandem with a rival nearing the far turn, moved to challenge for command three deep nearing upper stretch, wrested the
advantage and went clear under right handed pressure. SHES SKY HIGH tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail
nearing the far turn while coming under pressure to advance, saved ground through the second bend, found her best response then tipped out to the four
path entering the lane and continued with interest to prove best of the others. FEEL LIKE GUESSING angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking
behind the second flight, was prompted to make a steady gain inside the eventual winner nearing the far turn, advanced in tandem with that rival to bid for
command between rivals nearing upper stretch but flattened out leaving the furlong marker. SYLLABUS tracked off the second flight three wide racing to the
far turn but had no closing bid. SOLDAT TEMPTATION, caught four wide in the opening stages, shifted in on the backstretch to race behind the second
flight between foes but faded on the far turn. LADY MANHATTAN hopped at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace
thereafter. LA LENA was hustled well clear of the field into the backstretch, set the pace into the far turn and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner.
CALIFORNIA REIGN, restless in the gate, dropped out early.
