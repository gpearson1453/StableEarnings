Footnotes
CATCH THE SMOKE was well spotted just off the pace, made a bid along the rail with a half-mile to run, steadied against the rail near the seven-sixteenths
then dropped back a bit, saved ground through the turn, squeezed through along the rail to make a bid in upper stretch, took the lead approaching the
furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up under a right-handed crop inside that marker and powered away under steady urging to prove much the best.
JOKEMEISTER bumped with a rival at the start while last away, moved up under urging to set the pace, lugged out three wide into the turn then dropped to
the two path, was asked for his best in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the furlong marker and proved no match while able to get
the place. FATHER WALSH was urged along early then settled off the pace, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, chased outside into
upper stretch and weakened but was best of the rest. WINTER SON was reluctant to load, pressed the pace on the outside, vied four then three wide under
urging on the turn, chased the leader past the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the stretch and tired. VIBE SETTER bumped with a rival at the start then
dropped well behind early, moved out around the five-eighths, dropped in some leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path and was no
factor. BUSTIN PIETRE chased the pace down the backstretch, checked in the three path into the turn then moved to the five path and capitulated.

Footnotes
MY FIRST LOVE stumbled at the start and recovered outwards bumping EMERALD BANKER against pressure from ELEGANT LAOBAN outside
squeezing back FLIGHT FORWARD, prompted the leader from the outside three wide patiently handled until set down when seizing command three wide
into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive to prevail. ELEGANT LAOBAN broke in at the start squeezing back FLIGHT FORWARD against pressure
inside from the aforementioned foe, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, proved
no match for the top one while offering up a mild bid to secure the place honors. ICE KREEM SUNDAE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased five
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. PHENOMENAL WOMAN
bobbled at the start, advanced to take command shortly after and show the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from the presence of MY
FIRST LOVE to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, yielded the front spinning just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. KEEN
DANCER coaxed from the start, chased three to four wide coming under a right handed crop at the nine-sixteenths, tucked to the two path through the turn,
went three wide for home and made no impact. CREDIT SUSPENDED coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
angled five to six wide for home and faltered. EMERALD BANKER got bumped between foes at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and tired. FLIGHT FORWARD got squeezed back at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front before
settling into stride, chased six paths off the inside at the tail of the field down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and went four wide into
upper stretch while trailing throughout.

Footnotes
EL MAYOR settled at the rear of the compact field, was asked while slipping from the rail to the two path around the turn, rallied to the lead into upper
stretch, drifted in under a right-handed crop and put the runner-up in tight quarters inside the three-sixteenths, shook clear into the final furlong and held
under strong urging. EXALTED CHARM was sent hard to the lead then taken in hand after hitting the front, showed the way on the inside, lost the
advantage into upper stretch, steadied while put in tight by the winner while about three-quarters behind inside the three-sixteenths then dropped back,
moved out into the final furlong, gained on the winner into the final sixteenth but missed while well clear for the place. DONTBELATE tracked the pace
between horses, was urged along passing the nine-sixteenths, dropped back three then two wide on the turn and came up empty while best of the rest.
BREAKING STONES was coaxed along in the early going, dropped back under stronger encouragement at the nine-sixteenths, fell further back in the two
path on the turn and had nothing left. PRINCE OF JOY tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the turn and faded.
ACCEPTABLE RISK stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back in the four path under urging on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
HEAT'S ON ZAP broke a bit awkwardly then bumped with an opponent, went to the front, set the pace under pressure from both sides, shook clear in the
two path with three furlongs to run then dropped a bit closer to the rail, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a
left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under strong urging. EVAN HARLAN pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped
back along the rail with three furlongs to run, came off the inside into the stretch, drifted out in pursuit of the winner near the furlong marker and safely
secured the place. RUN SMITTY RUN drifted out just after the start, settled off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths in
hand, moved out while put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while just up for the show. ISLANDMAN dropped back then settled
towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT was forced out just after the start, pressed the pace
on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back at the three-eighths pole, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. NINTH OF APRIL
bumped with a foe at the start then was hustled, established a good position down the backstretch, was urged along in the two path around the turn and
tired. MISSOURI was forced out just after the start then dropped back, fell well behind while traveling greenly, rounded the turn in the two path and was no
factor. R BOY CHEEKUM settled on the outside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went four to five wide around the turn, dropped to the three path
outside the quarter-pole and faltered. TIMES PROVIDED UPON REVIEW.

Footnotes
POP THE BUBBLY was taken back between horses under tight restraint early then angled in, settled comfortably on the inside, saved ground through the
far turn, was roused while shifting three wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a strong hand-ride, closed well to get the lead just inside the
sixteenth-pole and proved best under good handling. WATERVILLE was taken back before the first turn then angled in, saved ground around that bend,
settled nicely in third position, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, was roused while moving from the inside to the two path on the final turn, gained to
take the lead in upper stretch, came out some while clinging to the advantage at the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken but well clear for the place. SWEET
FRANNY LU went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail around the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, extended the advantage
while inside on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the
show. INFRINGEMENT was taken up between horses early, went around the first turn in the three path, settled while last but one, was urged along in the
two path around the far turn and failed to threaten. HOME FOR CHRISTMAS went three then two wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside,
dropped back under urging while two then three wide on the far turn and capitulated. REIGNING CHICK ducked in sharply at the start and was slow to
commence, lagged at the rear while racing in mostly the two path and was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
EXOTIC WEST along the inside through the first turn, settled under a rating hold just off the pace three paths off the inside, tucked to the two path through
the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, tipped out to swing five wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the leader and take command
a furlong from home, dug in under a drive being flashed a right handed crop to come inwards a sixteenth out to get an eye on her main danger and held safe
to the finish. BATTLE BLING coaxed from the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn before settling three wide at the tail of the field down the
backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn and got placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, angled
in to the rail with three-sixteenths to go and rallied willingly along the inside issuing a challenge inside the final furlong but was ultimately staved off at the
end. FROST POINT broke through the gate prior to the start and was reloaded, raced forwardly placed from the start, raced three then two wide through the
first turn before settling four then three wide down the backstretch prompting the leader from the outside, tucked to the two path through the far turn and
advanced to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded a furlong out, angled in inside
that station and weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. ICE PRINCESS three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAIDEN BEAUTY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside into the first turn before tucking to the rail midway and then back to the two path down the backstretch, faced little pressure on the
front save for the presence of the attending FROST POINT to the outside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths as
the pressure intensified, yielded the front inside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened.
