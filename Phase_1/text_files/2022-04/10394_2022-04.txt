Footnotes
KING ADROCK prompted the pace setter from the outside while in the three path, bid entering the lane, assumed command in upper stretch, and widened
under strong hand urging. BAYTOWN GET IT ON laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, then rallied to reach place in the final furlong.
MO'S TREASURE raced off of the pace along the inside, shied while inside of a rival and along the inner railing at the five sixteenths pole, lost action in the
process, then moved up between horses in the late stages. ROL AGAIN DANCER took a bump from an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside,
shifted to the three path turning for home, but lacked a rally. I AM FREAKY FAST briefly lost his rider in the post parade, then broke a step slowly while
leaning into an outer foe at the start, took the turn in the four to five path while off of the pace, and failed to menace. DOMINICANA chased the top pair from
the two path around the turn, then weakened passing the quarter pole. UPTOWN SOCIAL set the pace inside of the pressing eventual winner while a path
off of the inner railing, proved no match for that rival at the three sixteenths pole, then weakened between horses in the final fulong. YOU'RE A DANDY was
outrun.

Footnotes
LAVISH HABITS saved ground off of the pace, waited for racing room turning for home, tipped to the five path entering the lane while picking up stride,
rallied while shifting outwardly to take aim on a leading BEACHFRONT BID at the furlong grounds, led between horses entering the final sixteenth, and held
gamely. MYRISKYAFFAIR settled off of the pace two wide, swung to the six path entering the lane, rallied to bid entering the final sixteenth, but was firmly
kept at bay through the late stages. CURIOUSLY rated kindly off of the pace in the two path, split rivals four wide in upper stretch, rallied to vie inside of
bidding foes approaching the final sixteenth, but flattened out late while getting outfinished. BEACHFRONT BID tracked from midpack along the inside,
gained in the four path turning for home to make first bid entering the lane, drew clear in upper stretch, but was bested by a pair of rivals entering the final
sixteenth. PURE COUNTRY sat reserved in the three path, shifted to the seven path entering the lane, stayed on to chase the leading group in midstretch,
but leveled off. DUVET DAY (IRE) settled back two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and failed threaten while moving up. POINT WELL TAKEN
pressed the leader from the three path, but was outkicked by a bidding rival entering the lane, and gave way between horses in upper stretch. JUST A
NYQUIST stalked along the inside, but faded through the lane. PORONUI set the pace while a bit off of the inner railing, but weakened between horses in
upper stretch. WINTER MUSIC broke a step slowly and shied a bit from an inner rival at the start, then failed to factor. BLAMETHECHAMPAGNE tracked
two wide, but was outmoved turning for home, and faded. RUN THE TAP broke a step slowly, then trailed throughout before being pulled up early in the
gallop out, was dismounted and untacked around the first turn, and got vanned off.

Footnotes
VIDAL set the pace along the inside, shook away from a pressing rival at the quarter pole, and held safely from oncharging rivals through the late stages.
PASSWORD PROTECTED took the turn in the four path while midpack, came into the lane five wide, rallied along with an outer TERAWATT through the
final furlong, claimed place between horses in the final sixteenth, and fended off the aforementioned foe to the wire. TERAWATT laid off of the pace in the
four to five path, fanned six wide entering the lane, then stayed on outside of foes while hanging on his left lead, bid for place in the late stages, but was
denied. GUNDUZ was hustled out of the gate to press the leader from the outside, but failed to keep pace with that rival in upper stretch, sustained his
chase while holding place through midstretch, but faltered late. FORMAL ORDER broke a step slowly, took the turn off of the pace in the three path, shifted
out to the seven path in midstretch, and stayed on. HOT PASTRAMI bumped an inner foe early on, then failed to menace. BARBARINO chased the top trio
from the three path while under steady urging, then tired between horses in midstretch. SCARY LARRY was bumped by outer foes into the inner railing
causing him to steady early on, and never got involved. FLORIDA GATOR bumped between horses early on, and made little impact. VOLBEAT stalked in
the two to three path around the turn, but weakened on his left lead in upper stretch. KIDYOUNOT never got involved. LITTLE ALEX hopped slightly while
breaking a step slowly, then was bumped by an outer foe into an inner rival early on, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MALIBU MARIE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of her leading stable-mate to take aim on that foe approaching the lane, ranged up to bid in
midstretch, and drew clear through the final sixteenth. MARR TIME set the pace while a bit off of the rail, showed the way around the far turn as her
stablemate gave chase, came under a drive to maintain a margin through upper stretch, but met that foe's challenge entering the final furlong, gave in a
sixteenth from home, and lasted to the wire for place. CUSTOMER DRIVEN saved ground in midpack, claimed show from outer foes entering the lane, then
shifted out, stayed on in pursuit of MARR TIME for place, but failed to reach that tiring rival late. SKRATCH KAT stalked two wide, chased under urging
between horses around the far turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, then failed to progress while hanging on his left lead. PARK ON THE NILE tracked
in the four path, stalked in pursuit in the three path around the far turn, but tired entering the lane. MISS CHAMITA slightly hopped while breaking slowly,
trailed around both turns, then improved in upper stretch. GLACKEN'S CAUSE never got involved. MYSTIQUE SABOTEUR pressed the leader from the
three path early on, but faded between horses at the half mile pole. IF YOU PLEASE broke a step slowly before shying from inner foes at the start, and
failed to factor. A MO REAY tracked three to four wide, but drifted out entering the lane while being eased up, then pulled up in the closing stages, failed to
cross the wire, and walked off.

Footnotes
HEALING tracked from midpack along the inside, tipped out to the four path passing the quarter pole while surpassing outer rivals, grinded away in pursuit
of the leading pair in midstretch while hanging on his left lead, ranged up entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage late. RED HORNET tracked
three wide, stalked around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, vied through midstretch, led briefly from between horses entering the final sixteenth, but was
outkicked by an outer rival soon after. ROCHAMBEAU vied for the lead two wide, showed the way a bit off of the rail down the backstretch, resisted RED
HORNET's bid in upper stretch, but yielded to that foe and another outer rival late. MYOPIC got rank and shifted outside of foes to the four path around the
first turn, tucked entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, then chased while mildly progressing through the lane. OF THE MOMENT vied
along the inside early on, stalked entering the backstretch, chased the top pair through upper stretch, but failed to progress before tiring in the late stages.
SUPPLY CHAIN stalked the leaders from the two path, tracked in midpack around the far turn, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but hung on his left
lead in upper stretch, got outkicked by rivals on either side in the process, and lacked a rally. GINSBURNED tracked from midpack two wide, fanned to the
five path entering the lane, but lacked a true kick to produce a bid. DADDY FRANK (GB) broke half a step slowly, and made little impact. IN EFFECT broke
a beat slowly, and failed to factor. TIZ OUR TURN pressed the pace in the three path early on, stalked two wide down the backstretch, but yielded between
horses at the five sixteenths pole. HUNT THE FRONT broke a beat slowly and never got involved. DUE TO AN INCORRECT SHOWING OF THE ORDER
OF FINISH, THE ADDITIONAL EXACTA, TRIFECTA AND SUPERFECTA WAGERS WERE HONORED.
