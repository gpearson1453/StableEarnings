Footnotes
ONCE A GIANT showed the way rated on the pace just off the inside, came under light coaxing and widened away midway on the turn, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to the finish. BOLD VICTORY broke out a step at the start and was bumped by RAISING SAND in a
chain of bumps due to pressure from BE ONBOARD, chased briefly inside before angling four paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
into the turn and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on
to secure the place honors. BE ONBOARD broke in at the start bumping CASH KID solidly into RAISING SAND and in turn BOLD VICTORY, chased just off
the pace two then three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened. CUGINE forwardly placed three then
four wide, came under coaxing half a mile from home, tipped five wide into upper stretch and weakened. CASH KID got bumped solidly between foes at the
start, chased four wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, continued four wide for home and faltered. RAISING SAND got bumped at the start by CASH
KID due to pressure from BE ONBOARD, who broke inwards, chased three wide down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn coaxed along
from the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
KING KUMBALAY bumped with a rival at the start, was taken under a very strong hold early, tugged his way to the front when nobody else had any interest
in the lead, was well rated under a snug hold, went around the turn in the two path while let out, responded well when asked in the three path into the
stretch, easily shook off the runner-up under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under strong urging. CIVIL WAR was coaxed from
the gate then tracked the leader under light restraint, dropped back some leaving the backstretch, saved ground early on the turn, was given his cue at the
five-sixteenths then shifted three wide, gained to make a bid in the four path into the stretch, battled outside under a right-handed crop while remaining on
his inside lead, was turned away by the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match but finished with good courage for the place.
SHAWDYSHAWDYSHAWDY bumped with a rival at the start, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the seven-sixteenths, moved from the three
path to the five path around the turn and came up empty while clear for third. GUSSY MAC (IRE) was coaxed from the gate then taken in hand early,
stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the three then four path around the turn, dropped to the two path into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
GOLQUIST hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from HEREBY to the outside, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and edged clear under a drive to prevail. PATRICK THE GREAT coaxed from the gate,
chased five then four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. HEREBY
broke in at the start brushing URAGANO, pressed the pace three wide patiently handled until set down continuing three wide at the head of the stretch, dug
in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. URAGANO coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
tipped three to four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SALT CAY hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the half
mile pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BOX OF JOE coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coaxed along with
seven-sixteenths remaining, tipped five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MEDIA SENSATION grew detached at the tail of the field early on four to five
paths off the inside when striding a bit green, tucked to the two path through the turn and continued just off the inside into upper stretch and trailed.

CASALSA broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, moved up under urging then pressed the pace on the outside, chased in three path around
the turn, made a bid into upper stretch, gained the advantage outside the furlong marker and drew clear under strong urging. TRUEBELIEVE raced just
behind the leader on the inside, drafted along the rail early on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and secured the
place while no match for the winner. BROCKMONINOFF was hustled to the front, showed the way under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the
turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the furlong marker and
weakened but was clear for the show. CONFORMIST raced just off the pace between horses, dropped back leaving the backstretch, rounded the turn in the
two path, shifted four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PROFUSION bumped with a rival at the start, was ridden along at the rear,
went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and came up empty. EXXTOP was last to commence, raced on the outside while urged along,
went five wide around the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
CRYPTO CASH chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong getting bumped by the leader just inside the sixteenth marker and got up to get the nod on the wire. TWO THIRTY FIVE broke out
at the start bumping MY FIRST GRAMMY, chased five wide advancing from the seven-sixteenths in tandem with AUBURN HILLS to his inside to engage
the top pair through the latter portion of the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and seized command near the three-sixteenths, dug in under growing
threat to the outside under a right handed crop, had the rider switch to the left hand near the sixteenth marker and came out bumping CRYPTO CASH
inside that station, then lost the bob on the line. AUBURN HILLS leaned on the near side stall, then broke in at the start bumping STRIKING SPEED, raced
four wide in pursuit, advanced in concert with the aforementioned foe from the seven-sixteenths coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five
wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. MY FIRST GRAMMY bumped at the start by TWO THIRTY FIVE, who broke outwards, chased three
wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and passed tired rivals. FREE ENTERPRISE coaxed from the gate, showed
the way early on until headed by STRIKING SPEED six furlongs from home, raced in closest aim three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths as a
pair of rivals joined the front to the outside, took over narrow and brief command swinging four wide into upper stretch, yielded the front near the
three-sixteenths and weakened. STRIKING SPEED bumped at the start by AUBURN HILLS, ranged up after the start to poke a head in front six furlongs
from home along the inside, tipped to the two path showing the way safely in front in hand but given his head freely, tucked inside into the turn and had a trio
of rivals advance midway on the bend, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response and yielded the front near the quarter pole before spinning just
off the inside into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

MORE AMMO was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, inched clear in the two path around the turn, was asked at the
five-sixteenths, extended the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, was shaken up for more in upper stretch, drew off under a hand-ride into the final
furlong and proved much the best while eased up to win handily. RHOMBIQUE drifted out early, settled off the pace, moved closer around the
nine-sixteenths, was urged along passing the half-mile pole then dropped back while moving out leaving the backstretch, went four wide through the turn
and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. DOLCE SERA broke a half-step slow, angled in at the rear then settled towards the back,
moved closer with six furlongs to run, chased inside around the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop and tired while well clear for the show.
MARTINI'S AMICA broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left.
EMPRESS THEODORA pressed the pace on the outside, chased in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch, drifted out near the
furlong marker and faltered.

Footnotes
ELECTABILITY prompted the pace of HAGLER to his inside early on then prompted the pace of UNBRIDLED BOMBER when that rival took over five
furlongs from home from the outside while never leaving the two path, advanced into the turn patiently handled to take narrow command three furlongs from
home, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, inched away straightened away into upper stretch
coming under threat to the outside, dug in gamely to the finish to rebuff the challenge to the wire. LUNI SIMA six paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied through the final furlong getting on
near even terms a sixteenth out fighting on gamely but was ultimately denied at the end. GOOD SKATE five paths off the inside down the backstretch just
off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn patiently handled until placed to coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning four wide into upper
stretch, weakened in the late stages. REBEL EMPIRE struck the near side stall at the start conceding two lengths to the front before settling into stride,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ONE MORE SCORE tossed
his head and was away to an awkward start conceding five to six lengths to the front, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide
through the turn, tipped five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. UNBRIDLED BOMBER got carried in at the start by EAGLE IN LOVE conceding five
lengths to the front before being able to escape that foe, chased inside briefly before advancing along the rail to take command five furlongs from home,
faced some pressure from ELECTABILITY to the outside, got headed for command with three-eighths to go and came under coaxing at that station, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. EAGLE IN LOVE broke in awkwardly at the start carrying in UNBRIDLED BOMBER with his head cocked to
the right side, chased three to four wide getting a corrective tap to the right side by the rider nearing the half mile pole, went three to four wide through the
turn and five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HAGLER led early on four paths off the inside under some pressure from ELECTABILITY to the
outside, got headed for the front nearing five furlongs to run, tucked three wide into the turn and retreated lightly coaxed along, swung four wide into upper
stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MASHNEE GIRL was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, moved clear at the seven-sixteenths, controlled the action in the two
path around the turn, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, clung gamely to the advantage in the final sixteenth and was fully extended
to last. A BIT O'IRISH SASS bumped lightly with a foe just after the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, was asked in the four path on the turn,
chased the winner under a drive in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and missed while able to get the place. KHALI MAGIC pressed the pace on the
outside, chased in the three path around the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth but also missed while able
to secure the show. WAILIN JOSIE settled on the outside, was roused in the five path on the turn, chased the winner while outside in the stretch and lacked
the needed kick. GRINGOTTS bumped lightly with an opponent shortly after the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the turn, moved
out into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. IFIHADACHANCE settled off the pace, was urged two to three wide on the turn and failed to rally.
SHADOLAMO dropped to the rear, angled out near the three-quarter pole, went five to six wide on the turn and was no factor.
