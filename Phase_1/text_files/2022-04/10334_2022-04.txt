Footnotes
SANTOS DUMONT away well, with the pace into the first turn, dueled onto the backstretch, continued to alternate into the far turn, disposed of the other
speed turning for home, drew out steadily while being kept to pressure. STARRININMYDREAMS within striking distance off the inside, stalked in the run up
the backstretch, moved closer in the three path second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the place. SALOW dueled up front
along the inside, continued to alternate up front into the far turn, began to weaken, remained closest to the winner with a furlong to run, could not contain the
runner up while saving the place. SERMONONTHEMOUNT in the second flight while racing off the inside, failed to respond when called on for the drive.
MANHATTAN UP off the pace outside, raced four wide through the first turn , continued outside, raced four wide again in the second bend, also came up
empty when the real running began at the head of the lane. SHORTLIST last away, remained back. RECONVENE was finished after a half.

Footnotes
OVERTAXED in the second group while off the inside, advanced three wide to challenge turning for home, vied past the furlong marker, edging away late
under steady handling. LUDWIG dueled up front while racing off the inside, continued to vie while between foes and inside the winner with a furlong
remaining, could not match strides with that one late, clear of the rest. MEAN JAKEY broke alertly, alternated up front closest to the inside, raced on equal
terms with the top two approaching midstretch, gradually weakened, saved show. SPEED BIAS fell back to trail soon after the start, continued to lag turn,
three wide into the lane, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position. SPANKSTER back off the early pace, four wide exiting the turn, failed
to muster a rally in coming up empty. CALL THE MALL went one paced throughout while racing three wide. KUNSHAN BRIDGE off a step slow, remained
always back in showing little. BE THERE closest to the dueling leaders in the run up the backstretch, stopped.

LIFE IS HARD broke alertly showed the way into the first turn, headed onto the backstretch closest to the inside, dueled far turn, shook off other speed,
increased advantage to the wire under a steady hand ride to win ridden out. CAERUS forwardly placed inside, continued to track the leaders inside, angled
out four wide turning for home, long drive for the place, gained the nod at the wire. ALEJANDRO last away, lacked speed just off the inside, three wide into
far turn, dropped to the rail late in the final turn, shifted out, missed the nod for the place. HIDDEN PROMISE moved up to duel outside the winner, narrowly
showed the way the middle half mile, faltered in the drive. SPACE ODESSEY prompted the issue late in the first turn four wide, continued outside, closer
three wide in the second bend then weakened through the stretch. GOSPEL WAY settled off the pace, remained always back. RESTORING HOPE void of
speed while slow to settle in the first turn five wide, remained always back. NAMESAKE rank first turn, five wide onto the backstretch, stopped far turn,
trailed home.

Footnotes
BACKGROUND broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, headed up the backstretch, retook the advantage in the second turn then edged clear in
the short stretch run under firm handling. TWILIGHT BLUE in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide out of the final turn commencing to rally,
finished willingly well out in the strip to gain the nod for the place at the wire. WELLS BAYOU forwardly placed while in the second flight in the three path,
moved slightly closer on the outside second turn, could not get to the winner through the lane, nipped late for the place. TITLE READY mid pack off the
inside, shuffled back when attempting to move closer onto the backstretch, continued back into the far turn, three wide into the stretch, improved position
through traffic. GUN IT settled off the pace while saving ground through the first turn, continued to save some ground second bend, came up empty in the
drive in lacking a late punch. FACT FINDING set or forced the pace while racing in the two path, gave way. SONNEMAN last away, was never involved
while remaining always back. MY SIXTH SENSE broke back, was never involved in showing little.

Footnotes
ACTING OUT broke alertly, set the pace while toward the inside shook clear entering the stretch, enough left to hold the runner up safe in the late going
under a brisk right handed crop. FRANK'S ROCKETTE broke with winner, in the second flight while off the inside, split foes when accelerating exiting the
turn, roused, slowly and steadily getting to the winner from the outside, ran out of real estate, well clear of the others. NOVEL SQUALL last to leave, lacked
speed off the inside, three wide through most of the turn, rallied for the show, no match for the top pair. JOY'S ROCKET moved up to a forward position
soon after the start, pressured the winner from the outside through the turn, steadily weakened through the stretch, caught for the show. WILDWOOD'S
BEAUTY within striking distance along the inside, gave way entering the stretch. LI'L TOOTSIE fell back to trail just after the start and was never involved.

Footnotes
WESTERN RIVER fell back to trail soon after the start, continued void of speed in the run up the backstretch, began a four wide advance far turn, continued
moving smartly upper stretch, won going away down the middle of the strip. RIDER'S SPECIAL also lacked early foot while off the inside, dropped to the rail
when moving closer late in the second turn, shifted out when straightened for home, up late to garner the place. PLAUSIBLE DENILE pressed early, fell
back the middle half, rejoined the fray in the second turn off the inside, briefly clear past the furlong marker, could not last. KING OTTOMAN within striking
distance, moved closer in the second turn in the three path, failed to sustain that advance in the drive. QUICK TO BLAME pulled early while in some traffic
in the first turn while keen, steadied slightly in continued traffic late backstretch, moved off the inside far turn, came up empty for the stretch run. CHIRON
four wide through much of the turn, continued outside and was four wide again in the second bend, failed to muster a rally when set down for the drive.
BLAME ELI off a step slow, raced back and failed to make much of an impact. COMMANDER COMPTON remained back. PAID IN FULL dueled early
inside, shook clear before a half, stopped when headed into the far turn.

I'M THE BOSS OF ME away well, dueled early off the inside, continued two path into the turn, shook clear soon after, maintained a comfortable margin
through the stretch under steady handling. PHAROAH'S HEART raced back early, improved through traffic in the two path through the turn, chased the
winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one to the wire, clearly second best. LIBERATED LADY (IRE) lacked speed, raced five wide out of
the turn, improved upper stretch, finished up best of the rest, not a threat to the top two while remaining well out in the strip. MUN LUV closest to the dueling
leaders early, moved out three wide late backstretch, within striking in the three path turn, had little left for the stretch run. IZZYBELLA last away, trailed well
back, moved out around a tiring rival late in the turn and picked off another couple of rivals while never a threat. SIANARA in mid pack off the inside, four
wide midway on the turn, tired. SWEET TEA broke well, dueled inside the winner for three furlongs and stopped, jogged in.

Footnotes
BREAKING NEWS forwardly placed after breaking with the leaders, in tight between horses for a furlong late backstretch while under stout restraint,
advanced to through the turn while continuing between rivals, disposed of that pair entering the stretch to shake clear, not threatened to the wire under
steady handling. A C EXPRESSWAY broke a step slow to race back for a half, in traffic exiting the turn, angled in for room upper stretch floating BANDIT
POINT to the rail, rallied in turn up the inside to gain the place. DRENA'S STAR behind the first flight, four wide through the turn when prompting the issue,
continued outside, lacked a closing punch. BANDIT POINT lacked speed while racing toward the inside, raced in the two path into the stretch, floated in
soon after, altered course to the outside afterward, improved position through the lane. CHIEF RON off slowly, trailed early, angled three wide exiting the
turn, showed some belated interest to improve position. MARTINI BLU in mid pack and inside, saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing bid.
WOBBERJOD with the pace for a half along the inside, gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. BEER CHASER lacked speed, five
wide turning into the stretch, made little impact. INCORRUPTIBLE set or for the pace for a half while in the three path, stopped. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY IN THE RUN THROUGH UPPER STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE TRAINER OF BANDIT POINT AGAINST THE
RUNNER UP FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
FULSOME shuffled back when in tight after the start, lacked speed in trailing the opening half mile, began to move into the far turn, circled toward the front
five wide turning for home, engaged the leader nearing the furlong grounds and wore that rival down under firm handling. CEZANNE broke sharp, stalked
the pace while off the inside, ranged up to challenge three wide midway on the final turn, put a head in front when straightened for home, could not contain
the winner late while clear of the others. RUNNIN' RAY with the early pace inside, chased the leader the middle half, lodged a bid midway on the final turn
while between horses, briefly led then could not match the top two the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. NECKER ISLAND lacked speed while
tucking in a bit in the first turn, raced back, improved through some traffic late in the final turn, steered out to be four wide into the lane, flattened out late to
finish up evenly. SILVER PROSPECTOR settled in mid pack just off the inside, raced in the two path up the backstretch and into the far turn, continued one
paced when roused turning for home. MO MOSA off a step slow, raced back early as a result, continued to save ground when improving a bit through the
final bend, also failed to continue that advance through the short stretch run. ROADSTER in the second flight while four wide through the first turn,
continued to race outside and was four wide again in the second turn, failed to muster a rally. MARKET ANALYSIS took command after the start, edged
clear before a half, held the advantage into the far turn, gave way when headed soon after. LAW PROFESSOR back off the pace outside, four wide into the
first turn, checked up across a rival's heels soon after, fell back, four wide second turn, remained back.

Footnotes
YUUGIRI broke in to bother inner rivals, showed the way into and through the first turn racing in the two path, relaxed in the run up the backstretch and into
the far turn, responded when confronted exiting the final bend from both the inside and outside, extended drive, came in slightly to brush with the runner up
a furlong out, again when that rival drifted out late, dug in the final strides to prevail in game fashion. BEGUINE broke alertly, allowed the winner the
advantage soon after, lurked behind that one and another forwardly placed rival, crept closer while continuing to save ground late in the final turn,
challenged nearing midstretch still inside, brushed with the winner, drifted out under a brisk left handed crop late to again come into contact, outfinished in
the waning strides. BUBBLE ROCK broke with the leaders, prompted the issue in the three path, continued to closely pursue the winner up the backstretch,
advanced and lodged a brief bid in the three path, flattened through the lane, remained clear of the others. I FEEL THE NEED off a step slow, void of speed
in the two path, saved ground into the lane, steered out approaching the furlong marker, improved position with some modest late interest. DREAM LITH
back off the pace and the inside, came three wide into the lane, roused, lacked a significant closing response in failing to fire. HEARTYCONSTITUTION
away in good order, raced within striking distance outside, remained prominent on the outside in the second turn, came up empty for the stretch run.
MARIAH'S FORTUNE bothered at the start when the winner broke in, remained back to be always outside. MAGIC CIRCLE bothered at the break, mid pack
for a half, gave way and finished far back while jogging in. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH,
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MACRON lacked early foot, began to move midway on the turn, knifed through between foes four wide turning for home, bid, dueled final furlong, proved
determined. ABSOLUTE CHAOS behind the leaders off the inside, challenged three wide late in the turn, led upper stretch, proved stubborn the final furlong
while holding the place. GAR HOLE last away, raced well back for a half, shaken up, steered out, rallied midtrack, too late. SUPREMACY raced in mid pack
while outside, five wide into the lane, improved slightly while widest through the stretch. STORM THE COURT dueled up front along the inside, continued to
vie into the lane, faltered the final furlong. EDGE TO EDGE one paced behind the leaders off the inside, fanned five wide into the lane, went evenly in the
drive in lacking a closing punch. NUCLEAR OPTION saved ground to no avail. JOE FRAZIER broke back and was never a factor. HAPPYMAC dueled up
front in the two path for a half and stopped at the head of the lane.

through the first turn, moved closer under light restraint late on the backstretch, challenged between horses soon after, gained command midway on the
final turn, clear into the lane, maintained a consistent daylight advantage the final furlong while under brisk handling, lugged out late. BARBER ROAD lacked

backstretch, moved out to be six wide far turn, made a good gain into contention late in the final bend, chased the winner past the furlong marker, slight drift,
flattened, caught late for the place. DOPPELGANGER forwardly placed while four wide through the first turn, continued forward, shuffled back in traffic
second turn, came on the outside for the drive, improved while not a serious threat. KAVOD broke on top, helped set a quick early pace inside, continued to

up inside the furlong grounds, continued to weaken. BEN DIESEL steadied when bothered when put in tight by the winner just after the start, lacked speed,
raced five wide through the final turn, went flat through the lane in lacking a closing response. WE THE PEOPLE washy when forwardly placed and five
wide into the first turn, continued to lack speed, four wide and in traffic second turn, came up empty for the stretch run. UN OJO off the pace, saved ground

Footnotes
TWISTED DIXIE off a step slow, raced back early as a result, moved out three to four wide turn, roused for the drive, slight drift 1/8, late surge to be up in
the final strides. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE broke sharp, narrowly set the pace off the inside, larger lead 2p into lane, proved stubborn to the inside, game for
the pace. BLAME J D off the pace and the inside, advanced four wide into contention in the second turn, challenged outside the runner up past the furlong
marker, outkicked between rivals in the final strides. IMA BLING CAT forwardly placed from the start, two path turn, dropped inside nearing the furlong
marker, finished up evenly in lacking a closing punch. MACHO ROCCO away well, raced forwardly and three wide through the turn, remained within striking
distance in mid stretch, also lacked a winning finish. NAVY SEAL in the main body while in some traffic into the turn, moved a bit to the rail to be two wide
into the lane, evenly to the wire. BELLAMYS ROAN in mid pack and off the inside, raced in traffic three wide into the turn, also failed to respond when called
on for the drive. YOU VEE CEE hesitated at the start, raced back in the early going, came three path into the lane, improved position while not a serious
threat. SUPER GEEK broke back, void of speed, came four wide out of the turn, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. CHICKEN HAWK with the runner
up inside that one for a half, gave way in the drive. MAHOMEY always back, was floated out five wide turning for home, continued to be outrun. DATA
STORM in mid pack early, began a steady retreat before a half.
