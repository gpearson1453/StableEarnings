AUJARA slow early angled out into the turn emerging at mid track in upper stretch surging clear in the final yards. CAUSE OF LOVE pressured the pace
dueling on the turn taking a narrow lead in the two path upper stretch ceding grudgingly to outside pressure late. SOLE FACTOR pressed early then
dropped off on the turn racing inside to upper stretch regrouping somewhat there with an even finish. FLATTER HER AGAIN a step slow while saving
ground to upper stretch angled to the three path there lacking needing response. A SMILE A DAY pressed on a narrow lead through the turn dueled into
upper stretch wearing out late along the rail. ROCK STAR LADY folded up on the turn.

under hand urging. BRODY'S JESSICA tracked the pace through the turn losing ground to upper stretch rallying seven then six wide down the lane willingly
getting up for place. ABERRATION stalked the pace pressing up on the turn to duel into upper stretch taking a short lead there in the four path being
overpowered from the outside late. BENEATH THE STARS away alertly pressured the pace through the turn dueling into upper stretch battling in the three
path coming up short. OFFTHEROADAGAIN pressed early then chased through the turn re bidding along the rail in upper stretch weakening bumping with
rival when in close nearing the finish. JACKIE THE JOKER slow early rallied on the inside in upper stretch before being bumped and jostled between horses
nearing the wire. SHE'S PURE SILVER hustled on the outside pursued five wide on the turn then faded in upper stretch. HIGH SPEED hesitated breaking
late. MY ROSIE had brief speed before retreating on the turn. KENDAL GRACE was never involved.

pressed a narrow lead through the turn shaking clear in upper stretch digging in from the three path being run down late. KID RUSSELL away alertly
pressed the pace moving between horses on the turn extending from mid track down the lane hanging late. SHOW SLIDING HOME rushed up to bid three
deep on the turn racing six wide into upper stretch wavering some late. HANSENATION slow early gave a mild rally to upper stretch looking for room late
finishing evenly in the four path. WEST LEONARD played no factor. MUSTANG WILLIE gained on the turn then weakened seven wide in upper stretch.

Footnotes

the pace extending into upper stretch responding there to finish a clear second best. BIRDIE'S CHANTZ raced mid pack moved inside to upper stretch
being squeezed between horses checking near the eighth pole. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM slow early saved ground to upper stretch being in a bit close near
the eighth pole finishing evenly along the rail. MARGARITA CINCO pressured the pace dueling through the turn, weakened in upper stretch lugging in
jamming foe near the eighth pole. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT played no factor. LAYITONTHICK pressed then chased through the turn weakening in upper
stretch. NOT JIMMY'S TOY was always outrun. AN OBJECTION FROM THE TRAINER OF GETOUTOFTHEHAREM AGAINST THE RIDER OF BIRDIE'S
CHANNTZ FOR INTERFERENCE NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
