Footnotes
CENTRIST allowed to settle, circled rivals five wide through deep stretch under left handed urging and was along in time. FREE SPEECH was shortly after
the start, shifted out to the four path, rallied through the stretch four wide and finished second best. MAS CHIKILIN pressed the pace two wide into the turn,
made the lead, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished. COLOMBARD with the second flight three wide, drew on even terms for the lead midway on
the turn, dueled until deep stretch and was also outfinished. FOX ON THE RUN chased the early pace, slipped through along the inside to draw on even
terms for the lead nearing the quarter pole, contested the lead until deep stretch then weakened. CUTLER was in tight along the rail at the eleven sixteenths
pole then was no threat. BIG TRIP broke in front, set the pace until mid turn, had speed into the stretch and gave way late.

and drew off. LINO'S KID sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, shook clear nearing the top of the stretch, maintained his

Footnotes
GRINS N' WINS never far back, closed with a burst of speed in the six then five paths, made the lead in deep stretch and finished full of run to win going
away. POWER BANKER sped to the lead along the inside, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear then couldn't handle the winner. GIFT FROM
MOM pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. HERE COMES JIGS trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed a gap late.
CAT'S RHYTHM failed to menace. CUT RATES was no factor. SWEET EVY GRACE pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then weakened.
CRISTALINDA was no threat. CARMEN OHIO had speed along the inside into the stretch then faltered.
