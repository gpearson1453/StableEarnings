the five path into the lane and leveled off late in the stretch. COMMON BOND was never a threat. SCALES OF JUSTICE broke a tad slow at the break then
was rushed up and set the early pace, raced on the inside along the turns and gave way down the lane.

Footnotes
SUNNY ONE tracked three, wide stalked the top trio around the far turn, tipped five wide entering the lane, drove past the leaders at the furlong grounds,
and drew clear. POCA MUCHA settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped three wide into the far turn, then to the six path in upper stretch, produced a
late rally with a good kick in the final furlong, and surpassed inner foes to claim place in the final sixteenth. SWEET SERENADE stalked along the inside,
then from the two path and in the pocket around the far turn, but lacked a kick to split the leaders in upper stretch, stayed on in the final furlong after an inner
rival gave way to bid for show in the final sixteenth, and prevailed. POSTNUP stalked three wide early on, pressed the leader between horses down the
backstretch before vying around the far turn, led in upper stretch, but was outkicked by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds, and yielded between
horses. UNDISTURBED stalked four to three wide, pressed around the far turn, came into the lane four wide, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper
stretch, and lacked a further bid. FAIR GAME settled far back along the inside, shifted to the four path in midstretch, and moved up between horses. VEZPA
(BRZ) vied two wide early on, cleared her inner counterpart at the five furlong pole, showed the way from a pair of outer vying rivals around the far turn, but
weakened in midstretch. PETER'S KITTEN trailed, swung to to the seven path entering the lane, but hung on his left lead and only managed to pass tired
rivals. DISCREET KITTY vied along the inside early on, backed off to stalk at the five furlong pole, then further faded turning for home. KESTENNA (GB)
tracked two wide and from between horses, but faded.

FIRE ON TIME set the pace inside of a pressing rival, met FABRICATE's bid entering the lane, and gamely kept that foe at bay through the stretch.
FABRICATE tracked four to three wide, ranged up turning for home to bid outside of FIRE ON TIME entering the lane, but only managed to chase
thereafter, and proved second best. MYEERAH tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch in pursuit of the top pair, and was best of
the rest. SPEIGHTFUL CHARGE laid off of the pace four wide, and improved entering the lane. SUM KINDA PRETTY was moving about when the gates
opened, causing him to be unprepared for the start, came out many lengths slowly, trailed the field around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and
surpassed tiring rivals. BLOSSOM ROAD vied two wide and weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. HOSTILE PRINCESS chased three
wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
SEVEN SCENTS stalked in the two path, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane to take aim in upper stretch, bid at the furlong grounds, led
leaving that station, and lasted from an outer oncharging foe to the wire. BULLSEYE BEAUTY trailed along the inside, swung six wide approaching
midstretch to be outside of rivals, and produced a strong kick in the final furlong, attempted a late bid, but missed reeling in the leader. OCEANIC vied two
wide while in the three path around the turn, gained an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by the eventual winner entering the final
sixteenth, yielded late, but saved show. HIGH CRIME got caught in the four path while off of the pace around the turn, tipped five wide entering the lane,
produced a grinding rally to gain show passing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked in the final sixteenth, kept on late, but missed reaching a yielding foe
late. MR. HUSTLE saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the two path turning for home, then to the five path entering the lane, offered a mild kick in upper
stretch before being put to tight quarters between horses in midstretch, backed out and altered outwardly, then kept on. HAUNT stalked three wide, tipped
four wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase on his left lead between horses through midstretch before fading. NATURAL POWER (IRE) raced
far back in the three path, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. INTO THE SUNRISE tracked in the three path, chased entering the
lane, dove inside of the faltering early pace setter at the furlong grounds, but lacked a rail kick. MAVEN set the pace inside of a vying rival while a bit off of
the rail, but got headed by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, then wilted between horses in the final furlong. INHALATION (GB) was taken in hand
between horses at the start, raced at the rear in the five path into the turn, but was bearing out entering the lane, and failed to factor. TURNED ASIDE
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but faded. BODENHEIMER saved ground in midpack, but weakened through the lane.

Footnotes
B DAWK prompted the pace three wide, gained an advantage into the turn, then drew off under driving pressure through the lane. EXACT ESTIMATE
tugged forward down the backstretch to split the leaders and vie at the half mile pole, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart into the turn, chased
that foe turning for home as GUEST SPEAKER ranged up alongside, dueled with that foe for place through the lane, and prevailed. GUEST SPEAKER
stumbled significantly at the start, recovered to track in the five path while perched outside of rivals, stalked in the four path around the turn, inched closer to
bid for place entering the lane while not threatening the leader, dueled with an inner rival for that position through the final furlong, but was bested.
GULLANE was slow into stride, took the turn far back in the five path, and improved in the late stages. ANARCHIST tracked four wide early on, then two
wide and between horses while in the three path around the turn, but tired in upper stretch. BIG HELLO tracked in the two path while forwardly placed early
on, but steadily faded in the four path around the turn. KENTUCKY MIST failed to factor. G FLAT made little impact. KINGMAKER set the pace along the
inside early on, but wilted into the turn. THOUGHT hesitated substantially at the start, and was outrun.

Footnotes
PETRICOR (GB) saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room entering the lane after intermediately coming under urging around the far turn, picked
up stride with clear rail sailing in upper stretch, split rivals two wide at the furlong grounds, bid inside of the leaders soon after, dueled throguh the final
sixteenth, and prevailed. ABSCOND tracked three wide, stalked around the far turn, tipped to the five path passing the quarter pole, produced a good kick in
upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds, battled through the late stages as an inner foe menaced, but got outfinished. FLATTER ME SILLY settled far
back three wide, swung to the seven path in upper stretch, and produced a belated rally. FOREVER DREAMING stalked two wide, pressed around the far
turn, bid entering the lane, led in the four path in upper stretch, dug in to meet ABSCOND's outer bid at the furlong grounds before PETRICOR (GB) loomed
inside, and faltered between those foes late. LASHARA (GB) tracked from midpack two wide, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, then chased evenly
among foes. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN got caught four wide while off of the pace, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but failed to menace between horses.
GOTE GO trailed, swung to the six path entering the lane, and moved up. QUEEN OF THE GREEN was never involved. URBAN FAIRYTALE stalked along
the inside after being a bit keen into the first turn, then tipped off of the rail in upper stretch after outer rivals made bids, then lacked a kick between horses
before fading. AMICHE was last away, then rushed in the opening stages, cleared into the first turn, showed the way around the far turn, but was headed in
upper stretch, and weakened at the furlong grounds.
