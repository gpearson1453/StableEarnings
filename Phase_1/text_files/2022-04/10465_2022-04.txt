Footnotes
ORBIT MARS broke a bit awkwardly but immediately picked up the chase, rounded the turn in the three path, drifted toward the top of the stretch, veered in
past the eighth pole and matched strides with LUNAR NOTION approaching the sixteenth pole then dug in to edge clear of that one late yards. The latter
accelerated to the front inside approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was met toward
mid-stretch and reluctantly ceded late yards. HURRICANE DIRECTOR chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn, eased out through the upper stretch,
came along for third late yards and was gaining on the early pace-setter. BIG EYE JOY chased and rounded the turn about the six path then passed rivals
outside in an even finish. MY BEST GIRL gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and ran evenly in the lane. PRINCESS MIA ROSE had an early
lead then gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn but weakened inside the eighth pole. LA LIMA
gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the lane.

ROCK FILE settled off the pace inside on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved four wide on the far turn, dug in to take over past
the sixteenth pole and drew clear approaching the wire. WEAVINTHEBLOCKS stalked the earlier pace in the three path, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn three wide then dueled through the stretch for second. THORN OF ROSE HILL saved ground on the first turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn just off the rail, then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. MINDYOURPSANDQS rated a slim
lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn but was caught flattening stride late yards.
CHAMPAGNE JAM settled off the pace about the three path, eased out into the backstretch and bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn
in the six path and finished well outside. HERCULES HARBOR stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage two deep on the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. MASTER YOO settled off the rail then faded past the three eighths pole.

FORGOTTEN MISSION gave chase toward the inside, ran in the three path of the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards.
BALTIMORE BUD chased through the backstretch, contested at near even terms two deep on the turn, cleared second in late stretch but was outfinished
for the win. STRONG SAFETY set a pressured pace, was met leaving the quarter pole, contested the edge at the rail on the turn but gave up the lead
mid-stretch and flattened stride the final sixteenth. HENRY STANDINGBEAR stumbled leaving the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn about the four
path, drifted to the seven path into the stretch, finished well and just missed third. REY O REYES pressured the pace inside, dropped back at the rail past
the quarter pole and flattened leaving the turn. TWOBITSARIDE chased, rounded the turn about the seven path and showed little in the lane. RAVEN RAHY
pressured the early pace but faded in the three path of the turn. VIDMER'S COURAGE broke a step slow and saved ground. NIGHTENFORD KAZ gave
chase outside and was not a factor.

half pole, challenged toward the three eighths and took over leaving the pole, drew clear past the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and was
steadily handled in the lane. BOOK OF DELANCEY rounded the opening turn in the three and four paths and raced well back leaving the turn, bid past the
seven sixteenths pole, steadily improved and raced five wide on the far turn, then dug in to take second later yards. FOREST FROST raced well off the
pace and off the rail, bid nearing the three eighths pole and ran three wide on the far turn, then gave up second in later yards. TRANSFER THE FUNDS
rounded the first turn about the three path and was well off the pace into the backstretch, bid leaving the three eighths pole, ran six wide on the far turn and
raced evenly to late stretch before flattening stride. MOTIVATED SPEAKER saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the
three path of the far turn, then ran evenly in the lane. SHACKLE IT raced with the early pace inside but dropped back at the half mile pole, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. CARSON AND I saved early ground and showed little response. AMAZING ROCKET
took over at the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead, was caught past the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but faded at the rail on the far

bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close in the three path of the far turn then dug in gamely to the finish. COASTAL CHAOS settled off the
pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the four path and was along for third just inside
the sixteenth pole. ARE YOU HAPPY saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little
further. MORE PLEASE rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was caught at the rail nearing the quarter and
