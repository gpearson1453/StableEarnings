Footnotes
TROPINKA pushed in at the start, four wide through the turn, challenged on the outside when straightened for home, quickly clear, kept to task. BEYOND
THE HYPE away in good order, dropped inside early in the turn, continued to save ground into the lane, rallied up the rail to be clear for the place, not a
serious threat to the winner. DIAL IT UP A NOTCH broke in to push the winner into the gap, was straightened and chased the leader up the backstretch,
collared that one late in the turn, lugged in to bother that same rival nearing the furlong marker when unable to match the winner, caught late for the place.
MILANA broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear, responded when challenged late in the bend, was vying nearing midstretch when brushed by a lugging DIAL IT
UP A NOTCH, weakened. MAGGIE'S WILL remained back in failing to menace. CANDY'S STORY in the second flight while off the inside, weakened
through the lane. FINAL TABLE was finished early, never a factor. KATHYS CUP OF JOE in mid pack while three wide into the turn, backed up through the
stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

MY DAMS ATITUDE off a step slow, lacked speed, four wide when beginning to rally in some traffic turning for home, outside just inside the furlong marker,
powered clear under steady handling. EURO ME off slowly, moved up to the second flight, behind some traffic late in the turn, challenged between foes
inside the furlong grounds, proved no match for the winner late, determined for the place. MOCHA KISS with the pace while between horses, dueled into the
lane closest to the inside, not enough for the place while coming back for the show. SULWE off a step slow, angled out sharply to be five wide turning for
home, improved position well out in the strip. HEATED ARGUMENT broke alertly, vied up front three wide and on the outside in the run up the backstretch,
dueled into and through upper stretch off the inside, faltered late. TAPIT RIGHT in the second flight while racing three wide, bit closer four wide late in the
turn, came up empty the final furlong. LADY ASTRID was finished early, no kick in the drive. OOCHIE with the early pace along the inside, gave way late in
the turn. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION, FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

PROUD VICTORIA pressured the leader off the inside up the backstretch, moved to engage that one midway on the turn, put a head in front entering the
stretch, drove steadily clear. SPURWINK LANE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, responded briefly when confronted by the
winner in the turn then proved no match through the stretch, remained comfortably clear for the place. TRULY A ROCKET behind the leaders in the three
path, remained three wide through the turn, lacked a winning response when set down for the drive, finished up best of the rest. TIGER BAIT went one
paced throughout while saving ground. DENALI ROCKET off the pace while well out in the strip, remained four wide through the turn, lacked a rally. FIVE
QUEENS in mid pack early toward the inside, came three wide for the drive, came up empty in the run to the wire. B'S LIL' BUMBLEBEE failed to menace
while racing just off the inside. FLOWERSFORSHANTELL broke back, raced in the three path, lacked a closing bid. ROSE MARIE B off the pace while well
wide, five path through the turn, tired. WARM BEAUTY off a step slow, trailed throughout while racing in the three path.

SHACKS WAY set the pace up the backstretch, shrugged off foe when straightened for home, drew well clear under steady handling. SKYSCANNER in mid
pack early, moved closer along the inside through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, held sway late for the place. WIN WITH PRIDE last
to leave, trailed early inside, continued to save ground through the turn, steered out for the drive, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. MR.
ANKENY pressed the winner up the backstretch from the outside, lodged a brief bid in the three path turning for home, relented soon after, continued to
weaken to lose a couple of positions late. SECRETARY AT WAR within striking distance early, fell back a bit in the turn then failed to menace while going
evenly through the stretch. WILD BEHAVIOR in the three path early, moved a bit closer in that path through the turn, flattened out in the drive. CARL G void
of speed, four wide into the turn, failed to threaten. CAN IMAGINE was through early while racing outside.

Footnotes
RED AGAIN with the pace from the start closest to the inside, continued to do battle up front in the run up the backstretch, dueled through the final turn,
disposed of that rival past the furlong marker, dug in late when confronted by the runner up, held that foe at bay under firm handling. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT
lacked early foot while angling to the rail first turn, continued back the middle four furlongs, two path into the lane, challenged outside the winner late, could
not get by. SEAU set or forced the pace off the inside, dueled far turn and into the stretch, weakened the final furlong, well clear of the others. MR. DOUGIE
FRESH with the early pace between horses and between the top two, fell bac, off that pair before a half, little left for the stretch run. PEPPER PIKE devoid
of speed in trailing for six furlongs, passed tiring rivals to improve position while never a serious threat. RIVER CACTUS off a step slow, raced back early,
improved through the final turn then failed to sustain that advance in the drive. JUSTIN'S QUEST in mid pack for five furlongs off the inside, tired.
BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS off a step slow, had nothing for the drive. COLOSI forwardly placed for a half, retreated.

Footnotes
TAP FOR ME rank, pulled early when with the pace, shook clear before a half after leveling off, continued to hold a clear advantage through the second
turn, not seriously threatened in the run through the lane while being kept to task. TEXAS RAIN void of early speed inside, took up in tight quarters midway
on the first turn, continued back, began to rally two then three wide second turn, getting to the winner late while having too much to do, clearly second best.
WARRIOR'S BATTLE behind the first flight early, chased the winner while off the inside into and through the second turn, had nothing more for that one in
the stretch, no match for the runner up the final furlong. MARIAH'S FORTUNE in mid pack early, moved closer in the two path in the second turn, failed to
sustain that advance through the stretch. DUPLICITOUS turned in a one paced effort throughout while racing three wide. C. C. HARBOR hesitated at the
break to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed well back, passed some tiring rivals while not a serious threat. A BROKEN BREEZE void of speed, four
wide into the far turn, failed to produce a rally when called on for the drive. SWANAGE prompted the pace while racing inside early, continued to save
ground, tired through the stretch. SUNDIAL finished after a half. LADY VALENTINE vied early while four wide into the first turn, chased the winner the
middle part then stopped far turn, jogged in after losing contact with the field.

Footnotes
RUN FEARLESS in mid pack early while off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, dropped in upper stretch, shifted back out a short time
later and finished full of run to win going away. PATTERN BET forwardly placed from the start outside, vied three wide into the turn, dueled two path into the
lane, clear past the furlong marker, no match for the winner late, lasted for the place. RUNNINTHESTREETS bumped early, raced back off the pace and the
inside, swung out further to be five wide into the lane, closed steadily down the middle of the strip to be gaining for the place. MIRACLE SHOES void of
speed, steadied toward the inside late in the turn in some traffic, moved out three wide into the lane, improved position with some late interest. GOLD
STRATEGY came in early to bump RUNNINTHESTREETS, raced in the second flight while three wide, light rated into the turn, asked along into the lane,
proceeded evenly through the lane. PRINIA broke sharp, set the pace along the inside, faltered when headed out of the turn. HAMAZING DEBATE
prompted the pace off the inside, continued to prompt the issue into the lane, gave way. RIVERCREST GIRL broke back, raced three wide when lacking
speed into and through the turn, passed tiring rivals through the lane while never a threat. MAY DISCO off slowly, lacked speed, four wide through the turn,
made little impact. ARDEN AR off slowly, fell back to trail before a half and was never a factor. SWEETNESS TO bumped early in traffic, raced in mid pack
for a half, tired in the drive. CALYPSO STREET tired while saving ground, well beaten.
