Footnotes
XYLOPHONE stalked the pace from the outside, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and finished gamely late to get up under strong handling.
MALIBU MIDNIGHT settled off the early pace, made a good three wide bid around the far turn, raced between rivals late and finished willingly to the wire.
GURKHA GOLD (IRE) settled to the middle of the pack early, moved up two to three wide and kept on to the wire. SWEET PERFECTION tracked Empty
Net down the backstretch, raced near the inside throughout and weakened through the drive. WILD PROSPECT was bumped, shuffled back at the break,
raced near the back early on, moved up four wide through the upper stretch and had not enough. EMPTY NET was quick to begin to set the early pace and
gave way the final quarter of a mile. CHEROKEE SUMMER was bumped at the break, dropped back early and never was a factor.
THOUGHTSANDPRAYERS was bumped at the break, raced towards the inside and had no response.

STRIKING OIL was coaxed along while racing three wide down the backstretch, raced well off the inside through the lane and drew off to be clear under
strong pressure. CRIMSON STORM stalked the pace, moved up to challenge Striking Oil near the three sixteenths pole from the inside but was no match
for the winner late. TENOR pressed the pace while racing between rivals down the backstretch and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. GEMINATOR
settled off the early going, raced widest through the lane and had no late rally. EUROEAST was slow early, raced three to four wide in the lane and had no
response. ROYAL TAP vied for the early lead from the inside, drifted through the stretch run and tired readily.

MY FRIEND AMY settled off the early pace battle, made a quick five wide move around the far turn and finished well to be clear under a hand ride.
AMERICAN COALMINER vied for the early lead from the inside, raced near the inside in the stretch run and held the place position. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA
was coaxed along early while racing four wide and kept on to the wire. TAIGA was hustled along in the early stages while racing three wide and weakened
the final eighth of a mile. TYPO pressed the early pace while racing between horses and faded. JOY IN THE BATTLE stalked the pace, raced five to six
wide through the upper stretch and had no response. CAUSE FOR LOVE was slow early and never threatened.
