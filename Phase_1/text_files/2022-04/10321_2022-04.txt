Footnotes
HAPPY CAJUN, carried out by STREET LAMP at the start, was quickly righted, then urged clear along the inside racing through the backstretch, widened
the advantage under hand urging into the stretch and was taken in hand approaching the wire. STREET LAMP ducked out at the start, was righted to track
the leaders inside a rival racing through the backstretch, tipped to the three path while being prompted to advance and continued with interest to prove best
of the others. MARSICO broke readily, was urged pursuing the pacesetter just off the inside to the turn and gave way nearing the lane. RUM NOT
BOURBON broke slowly, saved ground throughout and continued with some late interest to gain some position. BRAMBLE BEACH settled outside a rival
tracking off the first flight and dropped out early.

PREFERRED OUTCOME tracked the pacesetter inside foes under light rating racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance on that foe while
tipping out to the three path entering upper stretch, then produced a steady late response to wear down NOTORIOUS NICK and go clear in time under firm
handling. The latter ducked out at the start crossing into the path of PHILO while forcing that rival into GEMO, was quickly righted gaining the advantage
three deep, was urged dictating the pace a bit off the rail into the turn, held sway past midstretch racing a bit off the rail but yielded to the winner late.
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY, prompted to a position between foes tracking just off the pacesetter, was bumped, then steadied slightly out of tight quarters
nearing the nine sixteenths marker, angled to the rail nearing the turn and continued with a steady effort inside the top pair to close the gap late while
earning a share. MR LIGHTNING BOY was prompted to a position between foes in second flight, shifted inwards racing through the backstretch exchanging
some contact with YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY, continued between foes into the bend, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and finished evenly in late
stages. GEMO, carried out at the start, tracked just off the second flight five wide on the backstretch and steadily faded into the lane. PHILO was forced out
by NOTORIOUS NICK at the start while momentarily impeding GEMO, was righted to track the pacesetter four wide between foes on the backstretch but
gave way early. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
NOTORIOUS NICK BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

SWEET SENSATION, off last and a bit outpaced racing to the first turn, settled into stride along the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gained position
inside foes nearing the second bend, shifted out three wide leaving the midway point of the far turn, moved to challenge for command in that path racing into
upper stretch, wrested the advantage, then went clear late under firm right handed encouragement. SONG OF THE HEART, urged to a position tracking just
off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, moved to press the issue after a half, dueled for command into the far turn, resisted the winner's bid racing into
upper stretch but proved no match late while best of the others. LADY CREATIVE tracked off the first flight a bit off the inside, then between foes racing into
the far turn and continued with a steady effort in the closing stages to prevail for a share between foes late. LUNA'S TREASURE, urged to a forward placing
three wide tracking just off the leaders for five furlongs, steadily faded into the stretch. G G'S DARK STAR sprinted to the lead along the inside racing to the
first turn, dueled for command inside rivals nearing the second bend and gave way nearing midstretch. CURRENT CAUSE settled off the second flight
outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no threat.

Footnotes
WICKED GOOD broke inwards, then was held up off a rival while dropping out last, angled to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground racing into the
turn gathering momentum, shifted off the inside to split foes advancing in close quarters racing into upper stretch, bid for command inside the pacesetter
leaving the furlong marker and went clear under right handed encouragement. PONY GIRL, forwardly placed four wide racing just off the leaders on the
backstretch, advanced three deep entering the turn to press the issue, gained a clear advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. AMAZING GRACES JOY broke sharply, angled inwards pressing the pace between foes racing through the backstretch into the
turn, shifted to the inside entering the lane and weakened nearing the furlong marker. YABA DABA DIVA, reserved while racing well off the inside tracking
the leaders from out of striking distance, altered course slightly outside the eventual winner nearing upper stretch, then continued evenly between foes while
being outkicked for a share. EXPECT TO BE READY switched off the inside tracking just off the leaders on the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into
upper stretch but offered no rally. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE was urged inside foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way after a
half.

Footnotes
CAPE HEDGE broke slowly losing several lengths to the field, then came under pressure while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, steadily gained
position inside foes nearing the far turn, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch, continued with a sustained response to wrest a narrow advantage
leaving midstretch, then continued under firm right handed pressure to edge clear late. DEREGULATION (GB) was urged three deep pressing the pace in
the opening furlong, continued to force the issue outside a rival nearing the backstretch, shook clear after a half to set the pace into the far turn, resisted the
challenge of MIDNIGHT TEQUILA nearing the lane to maintain a narrow advantage into the stretch but proved no match for the winner late. CREATIVE
CHOICE, caught five wide while being prompted to a contending position racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders four wide, then three deep in second
flight racing into the far turn, lost some position entering the stretch but continued with interest outside rivals to prevail for a share in the closing stages.
ASSERT DOMINANCE tracked off the first flight between foes, then dropped off the second flight racing into the backstretch while shifting inside, was urged
to advance tipping off the inside to split foes racing through the far turn, angled to the rail to challenge inside foes entering the lane but came up empty late.
MIDNIGHT TEQUILA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the backstretch, tipped out racing into the far turn advancing on the pacesetter
to briefly challenge that rival nearing upper stretch but flattened out entering the lane. MAGIC BOMB, urged between foes, then inside a rival disputing the
pace from the outset into the backstretch, gave way when failing to match the pacesetter racing into the far turn. RAGING WHIRLWIND settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. WICKED MOMENT dropped out early. NOBLE CROSS, urged inside rivals prompting the pace in the
opening stages, was eased back while shifting off the inside racing into the backstretch and gave way abruptly after a half. PALACE SINGER, urged to a
forward placing four wide between foes into the first turn, emptied out early.

Footnotes
ORNERY ANGEL was rated out of striking distance behind the second flight while shifting off the inside on the backstretch, responded when prompted to
advance on the leaders in the five path nearing upper stretch, continued with a steady gain while shifting inwards under pressure in the closing stages and
just edged LYRICAL in time under firm right handed pressure. The latter tracked off the first flight inside foes on the backstretch, made steady progress
nearest the rail to challenge inside the pacesetter approaching midstretch and contested the issue to the end while just failing to match the winner's kick.
PROBABLY GRACE, held up momentarily in close quarters at the start, tracked the leaders three deep in second flight on the backstretch, angled inwards
nearing upper stretch to bid between foes entering the lane but couldn't match the top pair late while prevailing for a share. BIONIC BOTTLE was urged
disputing the pace a bit off the rail through the backstretch, shifted to the three path dueling for command between foes into the stretch and faded in late
stages. TEE UP, in touch attending a rival's pace on the backstretch, tipped to the four path nearing upper stretch and faded between foes in that path
nearing midstretch. WORKING OVERTIME settled last, then angled to the inside on the backstretch but never gained contention. HASTY LADY tracked off
the first flight between foes racing to the turn and gave way nearing the lane.

LADY JEAN broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue entering the turn to gain a narrow advantage
nearing upper stretch, then edged clear in the closing stages under firm left handed encouragement. KITTY KITTY tracked off the leaders between foes
racing into the turn, tipped outside the leader racing into upper stretch and proved best of the others. BELLARIFIC, urged to dictate the pace on a narrow
margin while angling to the inside on the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner through the turn to upper stretch and gave way late.
PRINCESS LIVIA tracked off the first flight three wide racing through the backstretch into the turn and faded entering upper stretch. BALLET SCHOOL, off
slowly, was settled off the second flight racing off the inside into the turn, then shifted entering the stretch and continued evenly along the inside late. BION
MAGIC settled outside a rival in the last flight on the backstretch and failed to menace thereafter. SWEET BABY RAELYNN was rated just off the leaders
stalking those rivals along the rail through the backstretch into the turn, suffered an apparent catastrophic injury leaving the five sixteenths marker,
dislodging her rider while falling down, then was vanned off the course after the race.

Footnotes
GROWL TIGER, pulling against restraint inside foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, moved to gain the lead leaving the half mile marker, held
sway on a comfortable advantage racing into the turn, forged well clear under right handed pressure racing through the stretch and was taken in hand late
while widening to the end. MONAASIB, off slowly, was settled along the inside in early, saved ground on the turn gaining position and continued with
interest inside foes to prevail for the place honors. THE BEST DISTANCE switched off the inside racing through the backstretch tracking off the first flight,
lost some position nearing the lane, angled to the rail entering the stretch and continued with interest to improve position while prevailing for a share. LIFE
CHANGER tracked off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch into the turn and lacked the needed closing bid. WELD, urged between foes
pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into the lane. FIRSTCADETE settled outside foes in early stages and failed to menace thereafter. BLACK V.
K. dropped out early. FORWARD MOTION, prominent three wide in the opening stages, gave way between foes in that path after a half.

Footnotes
TIZ HERSELF broke readily, tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out three wide entering the far turn while being prompted
to advance, continued with a sustained bid under brisk handling to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went well clear late. R TENDERONI,
off a bit slowly, was urged to a forward placing just outside the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, took over from that rival racing into the far turn, resisted
the winner's bid with a grudging effort to midstretch but proved only second best. LOVIN LIVIN settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, split
foes nearing upper stretch, then continued with an effort to improve position three wide in the closing stages while earning a share. SILVER PACKAGE
settled last to the far turn and passed only tiring rivals. ME SAY SO, urged to the lead while angling to the inside, set the pace to the far turn and gave way
nearing upper stretch. GRANDMARY, off slowly, was urged to gain a position three deep tracking the leaders in second flight to the backstretch and steadily
faded racing through the far turn. TEGLA tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the backstretch, shifted to the inside after a half, was taken up by
her rider entering the far turn and was vanned off the course.
