BOWLMAGEDDON stalked the quick early pace from the inside, tipped out leaving the bend, overtook SHARP CURVE leaving the furlong marker and
pulled away in the end. SHARP CURVE was hustled leaving the start and set quick fractions through the turn, was caught by the winner leaving the furlong
marker and was outfinished by that one but kept on to be best of the rest. SASSY EINSTEIN saved ground while lacking early speed, maintained a rail trip
into the stretch and closed well in the late going to secure the show. FIREITUP was a bit keen in the early going and steadied off heels nearing the half-mile
marker, chased three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. UNAFIESTAPARATODOS stalked the quick pace two deep on the turn, was outkicked in
upper stretch and faded in the late stages. THISONESFORBARRY chased the early pace, was steered outside of rivals on the turn and did not have a late
response in the stretch.

Footnotes
CANNONBALL COMIN stalked the fast pace three wide on the turn, lost a bit of ground in upper stretch, made a late push in the final sixteenth and edged
clear in the end. PRINCE DE PRINCE settled off of the early pace, was roused three wide into the drive and made a steady advance under firm urging to
get up for second. SUNSET DRAGUNN broke alertly, set fast contested fractions through the turn, could not hold off COLORMEMONEY into the stretch
run, came back on in the final furlong to vie for the lead approaching the sixteenth-marker but was outfinished in the end, while just holding for third.
COLORMEMONEY pressed the fast pace, vied for the lead nearing the quarter-marker, took command into the final furlong but was outkicked in the end
and just missed for the show. EMERALD MAGIC was pinched at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the pace while saving ground, advanced
in upper stretch and was outclosed in the final stages. TRIBAL STORM settled off of the fast early pace, gained ground while widest of the field nearing the
furlong marker but lacked the needed response in the late going.

DON'T TELL HYDEE chased the pace from the inside, advanced in upper stretch, slipped inside of HANNAH IN A HURRY in the final stages and kicked
clear in the end. HANNAH IN A HURRY stalked the pace, made a steady gain to confront the pacesetter inside of the furlong marker, could not match
strides with the winner and was outkicked in the end while holding safely for second. LA POPIS broke alertly and was sent to set the fractions, came under
pressure nearing the furlong grounds, was caught and outfinished in the late going but was clear of the rest for third. TIME TO SMILE was forwardly placed
through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. FIT FOR TOM broke in at the start and bumped HANNAH IN A HURRY,
chased the pace and tired in the late stages. KISS OF CRAN was reluctant to load, chased the early pace and lacked a late response. NITE SALE was
bumped sharply leaving the break and took up soon after the start, chased the pace outside of rivals, gained a bit of ground five wide on the turn and faded
in the drive. TICKLE ME CRAZY was a bit slow away from the gate, lacked speed to the turn and was not a factor.

safely in the end over the oncoming runner-up. LOVELY COLLEEN stalked the pace three wide on the turn, was roused leaving the furlong grounds, closed
well in the late stages and was unable to reel in the winner but was best of the rest. PRESKITT pressed the early fractions, lost ground along the turn and
was outkicked in the stretch, while well clear of the rest for third. SMILING THUNDER bobbled at the start, recovered then was keen in the early stages and
steadied off of heels nearing the half-mile marker, was steered four wide on the turn and tired in the late stages. LIGHT UP lacked early speed to the turn
and was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHIEF WILD EAGLE saved ground while off of the early pace, improved position on the far turn three wide, closed in upper stretch to vie for the lead
nearing the furlong marker, took command into the late stages and dug in to prevail. CAT GAMER was never far back in the early stages, gained ground in
upper stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final stages but was best of the rest. RIMPROTECTOR was content to settle in the early stages, gained
ground three wide on the second turn and continued that rally through the lane to secure the show. MITAD DEL MUNDO was four wide while close up on
the first turn, took command of the pace into the backstretch run, extended the lead nearing the quarter-marker, was caught approaching the furlong
grounds and weakened in the late stages. QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW saved ground in the early stages while traveling in the second flight, was steered
three wide on the far turn and lacked a late response. TAM'S TIME set the early pace, stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, lost ground on the far turn
and faded in the final stages. STEMWINDER settled off of the early pace and weakened in the late going. STAY LIT was forwardly placed in the early
stages, lost position along the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and gave out in the late stages.

CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) settled three wide off of the early pace, advanced along the backstretch run and into the second turn, mounted a three wide bid
into the drive, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, took command into the final stages and responded to steady urging to hold safely in the end.
SUNSET STAR was forwardly placed while two wide on the first turn, was steered four wide on the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch, came back on
in the final stages and was outkicked in the end but was best of the rest. HARBOR ABBEY broke alertly and was hustled to set the early pace, was engaged
by SHANGHAI MIST along the backstretch run and dueled with that foe on the front end through the quarter-marker, could not hold off the winner in the final
furlong and was outfinished but was a clear third over the rest. SHANGHAI MIST stalked the early pace then was given rein to contest the pace to the
quarter-marker, lost a bit of ground in upper stretch and weakened late. BLUE BREEZE was unhurried in the early going, mounted a five wide bid into the
stretch but flattened out in that effort in the drive. KISS RIDE GOODBYE saved ground in the early stages while settling off of the pace, advanced three
wide on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. STEIN'S GIRL was four wide on the first turn while off of the pace, continued that wide trip through the
backstretch and into the second turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was not a threat. KITTYBE QUICK settled just off of the early pace, lost ground
on the second turn, was steered to the six path for the stretch run and tired in the late stages.

ASSIGNATION settled off of the pace while saving ground, angled out at the top of the stretch, closed fast in the late stages to overtake MOMMA MOCCA
and kicked clear in the end. MOMMA MOCCA stalked the pace from a two wide path, closed on OCTANE in upper stretch, was overtaken by the winner
inside of the sixteenth-marker and was outkicked but held safely for the place. OCTANE (BRZ) broke alertly and was sent to set the fractions through the
second turn, came under pressure in upper stretch, was outfinished by the top pair but kept on to hold for third. REV REE saved ground while just off of the
pace and did not mount a late rally. GEA was allowed to settle, gained ground three wide on the far turn and finished evenly in the late stages. ROSE
PRINCESS settled just off of the early pace, gained ground on the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
MILEYS BLUECAT stalked the fast early fractions from an inside path, shifted out at the top of the lane, made a steady advance in the final furlong, surged
in the final strides and was up at the wire for the win. JOHNNY DAR broke alertly and showed good early speed while setting fast fractions, edged to a clear
lead nearing the furlong marker, was all out in the final sixteenth when confronted by the winner and was nailed on the wire for the win, while besting the
rest in a good debut. FRISCO KID chased the fast pace five wide on the turn and closed in the final stages to earn the nod for third. HUNTERS GHOST was
off slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter-marker while four wide, continued to advance in the stretch run and closed
willingly in the end, just missing for third. DUDE IT'S A PARTY contested the fast early pace from a three wide path and was outfinished in the stretch run.
THE LONNA RANGER was away slowly, chased the early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and did not mount a late rally. SHANGHAI WILD CAT
disputed the fast early pace, dropped back midway through the turn and was not asked for run in the final stages.

Footnotes
PHANTOM INDIAN saved all of the ground while settling off of the early pace, closed fast leaving the bend and into upper stretch, overtook LOUD
FUSAICHI inside of the furlong grounds and kicked clear in the late stages. LOUD FUSAICHI broke alertly and was sent to set the fast pace, shook free of
CLEAR WIN nearing the quarter-marker, could not hold off the bid of PHANTOM INDIAN inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished, while clear of the
rest for second. MAGGIE FITZGERALD chased the pace, mounted a five wide rally into the stretch and was clear for third in the end. CLEAR WIN attended
to the fast early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn, improved a bit in upper stretch but faltered in the late going. ZAKKIYYAH was forwardly placed in
the early going, lost ground into the stretch run and was outkicked in the final stages. TIZ A TIGER chased the pace outside of rivals to the turn, lost ground
five wide on the turn and did not offer a late rally. JANERO ROSE lacked early speed, advanced to chase the fast pace four wide on the turn and gave way
in the drive. CLEVER CHIEFTESS hopped at the start, recovered to chase the early pace, was hard to place along the turn while two wide and weakened in
the stretch run. LAST INNING chased the fast pace six wide on the turn and tired in the late stages. MI AMARE stalked the pace three wide on the turn and
faded in the stretch run.
