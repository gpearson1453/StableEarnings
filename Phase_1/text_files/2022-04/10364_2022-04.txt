NO SYMPATHY stalked three wide, bid to the front into the stretch and pulled away under moderate coaxing. PEARLBDANCING dueled in the two path,
moved briefly clear at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. TREASURE SEEKER lacked speed then split rivals in the stretch rallying for third.
LADY SIMPATIA prompted the pace inside then began fading on the turn. IMAGINARY SKY dropped back despite urging inside and was never a factor.
PAGE ELEVEN trailed early, moved wide in the stretch while outrun. MICHAELA VEE alternated for the lead inside to the quarter pole and stopped.

Footnotes
IRISH JUMPER raced three wide early, stalked between rivals, chased on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong
marker and then drew clear under urging. BELLAMY'SPARTYGIRL vied outside for the early lead, took over on the backside, shook free on the far turn,
dueled between rivals into the stretch, dug in gamely and came up second best. BRODY SLAM vied inside for the early lead, then tracked the pace on the
backside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled and flattened out. SWEET BALLERINA stalked three wide, chased the
leaders on the far turn and tired. MONSTER RISING raced two wide off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and failed to threaten. YOURINDENIAL
raced four wide off the pace, then chased three wide and gave way. REMEMBER THIS GAL raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

STAY HYDRATED firmly rated close up, took over when ready near the quarter pole and pulled clear under confident handling. LAWLESSNESS lacked
speed, angled out in the stretch and closed well for place. NINE TOE JOHNNY stalked the pace four wide down the backstretch then weakened in the final
furlong. DON'T RECALL lagged far behind inside then narrowed the gap while no threat. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER saved ground close up then began fading
on the turn. SAPONARA hustled to the front inside for half a mile and faltered. PERFECT REVENGE dropped back outside, then trailed in the stretch losing
contact with his field.

SUBSIDIARY stalked close up racing three wide, bid three wide on the turn, dueled with SOUTHERN CENTS in upper stretch, put away that rival and drew
clear in the final sixteenth, driving. I'M THIRSTY tracked close up on the inside, moved up on the rail to challenge at the half mile marker, chased on the far
turn, then rallied inside in the final furlong to get second. SOUTHERN CENTS rated the pace in the two path, vied two wide on the backside, showed the
way on the far turn, dueled with the winner in the lane, weakened and held for third. SWEET BLAME raced off the pace, went three or four wide on the
backside, bid four wide on the turn, continued evenly and missed for third. WEST HORIZEN raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn, raced evenly
in the lane and between rivals in deep stretch. FLORENCIA raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. JANELLE DREAMS raced off the pace inside
and was outrun.

BRILLIANT CHASE broke a step slow, raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, swung wide, came five wide into the lane, closed steadily outside
and wore down HIGH VELOCITY in deep stretch for the win. HIGH VELOCITY showed good early speed to set the pace, responded when roused, dug in
gamely in the stretch run and yielded grudgingly late. JOHNNY RITT chased on the inside, rallied on the rail in the stretch and got third. RACK GIN was off
slowly and outrun early, moved up entering the stretch, angled out and closed belatedly outside. NIMBLE BEAST stalked three wide, chased three wide on

Footnotes
CALL FITZROY was outrun early, advanced midway on the turn, came two wide into the lane, split rivals nearing the sixteenth marker, closed willingly to the
front and won going away. AMERICAN RIVER (VEN) raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn, rallied on the rail, gained a short lead past
midstretch and dug in gamely to the end. I SAW IT ALL tracked on the inside, rallied three wide into the lane, bid, dueled past the furlong marker and was
outkicked. INDIRECTLY raced off the pace, between rivals, angled out entering the stretch and rallied mildly outside. KIKKERLAND away alertly, set the
pace racing with a clear lead, dug in through the stretch drive and weakened late. YEI YEI stalked three wide, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. CALL
ME G Q stalked two wide, chased on the turn and tired. RISING STORM raced off the pace, inside on the turn and failed to threaten.
