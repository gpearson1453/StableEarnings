BUILDING HOME vied for the lead, challenged throughout, saved ground, took command and won under steady urging. GILDED APPLE broke a step slow,
quickly rushed up, pressed the pace, couldn't match strides with the winner, but was a clear second. ENVOYS LEGACY raced near the back, came around
the turn on the outside, made a mild bid, finished wide and proved no match for the top two. RIVETRIX dueled on the front end and faded. SASSY
MALLORY lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never a threat.

Footnotes
FASHION MERIT vied for the early advantage, raced outside around the first turn, drove clear down the backside, moved to the rail, dueled to the wire,
being challenged by JUBELLA and prevailed for the win. JUBELLA pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, moved up on the outside around the final
turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for the win, but held on for second. CRIMSON FELINE raced in the middle of the field, made a late wide bid,
missed second, while putting forth a game effort. SHE A HOT MESS lacked early speed, made a late rail bid and finished willingly. COINMAKER void of
early speed, finished wide and was never a factor. GATOR PROUD always raced near the back, saved ground around the second turn and showed little.
KIND WAYS flashed early speed, saved ground around the second turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
YES BAB void of early speed, made a steady gain, rallied wide down the home stretch and drove clear. FLASH ME BACK raced in the middle of the field,
made a late wide gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT showed early speed, racing on the inside, steadied down
the backside, getting in tight quarters, moved up on inside around the turn, rallied down the stretch and finished willingly. ZCAT'S CHATAIN vied for the
early lead, forwardly placed throughout, saved ground around the turn and was outfinished, while putting forth a game effort. FAZIO pressed the early pace,
raced close throughout and lacked a finish. CLASSIC GREELEY lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER broke
a step slow, made a steady gain, took command coming out of the turn, drove clear and hung late. SHANGHAI BROTHER raced within striking distance
and faded. AW SHUCKS raced near the middle of the field and retreated. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE vied for the lead early, dropped back coming out of the turn
and was done. TIN ROOF RUSTED always raced near the back and showed little.
