Footnotes
QUEEN OF POMPEII raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, challenged two then three wide leaving the turn, took over and clear in upper stretch
and held safely in the end. MAGIC GAME stalked along the inside, tipped three wide nearing the stretch, finished willingly down the lane but could not
threaten the winner in deep stretch. SHE'S A JOKER chased outside a rival then settled in mid-pack, went two wide between rivals around the turn, moved
out and came four wide into the stretch and held the show. CLADDAGH CURE got put in tight quarters and checked early, ran up on heels and steadied into
the turn, chased two wide into the drive and summoned a mild rally but could gain the show. SUMMER LAKE broke a step slow, dropped back early,
entered the turn three wide, swung out into the stretch and improved position. BAKER KAIT away quickly from inside, bobbled crossing the dirt then took full
control, roused with a quarter mile left to run, challenged from outside leaving leaving the bend, drifted in and almost hit the rail in upper stretch, losing
command in the process and weakened in the final furlong. HEAVEN'S GHOST tracked off the rail then steered down to the fence, shifted to the two path
around the bend and could not rally. MARGOT'S GIRL got crowded between rivals and forced to check early, took an awkward step crossing surfaces,
saved ground to the stretch, then tipped out but failed to menace. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE sat off the pace well off the rail, went three deep into the turn, got
floated five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. APPLAUD THE BENCH stalked three wide into the turn, came four wide into the drive
and weakened.

Footnotes
PARNELLI sped to the front and steered to the inside, set the pace with THERE GOES HARVARD alongside, was overtaken in upper stretch but battled
back gamely through the final furlong and was all out to get up at the wire. THERE GOES HARVARD pressed PARNELLI from outside, moved up to take a
short lead in upper stretch, battled through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. DIVINE ARMOR away well in the beginning then chased the top trio in the
two path under coaxing into the first turn and eased to the three path leaving the bend, trailed off the rail in the middle stages, steered out and came four
wide into the lane and bested the rest. BACK RING LUCK was off a step slow then moved up to a forward position three wide early, remained off the rail
and coaxed around the far turn, failed to find the needed response and got edged for the show. SPIRIT MAKER stalked along the inside then a bit off the
rail into the backstretch, moved to the rail again on the far turn then entered the stretch two wide and faded.

Footnotes
BALLY'S CHARM lightly brushed the gate but still came away well, applied pressure outside JACK SIXPACK early on, lost touch with that rival around the
far turn, re-engaged from outside with a sixteenth remaining and drove past. JACK SIXPACK set a pressure pace with BALLY'S CHARM to the outside,
cleared that rival around the far turn, carried the lead into the final furlong, pressured again by BALLY'S CHARM in the final sixteenth and could not fend off
the winner. WORSE READ SANCHEZ rated on the inside, shifted out to the three path entering the stretch, bid outside the top pair late but lacked the
needed late kick. FOWLER BLUE reserved in the two path early, saved ground around the far turn, showed a mild response in the lane and whittle the gap
on the top trio. ROCKY GIBRALTAR was off a bit slow to begin, stalked the top pair off the rail, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, bolted outside
entering the stretch and weakened. BIG SPLASH lagged behind on the inside, traveled two wide into the stretch and never got involved.

GOT THUNDER bumped PIROLI at the start, had speed three deep into the first turn then moved back a bit to stalk the top pair, bid three deep on the far
turn and vied four wide into the stretch, held a slim advantage entering the final furlong and inched away from GO JOE WON in the late stages. GO JOE
WON had early speed along the rail into the first turn then dueled with BALLADEER, vied with a pair of rivals around the far turn and into the stretch, fought
with GOT THUNDER in the final sixteenth and was bested in the end. BALLADEER showed speed between rivals into the first turn then dueled outside GO
JOE WON, vied between again on the far turn and down the stretch, fought into the final sixteenth and faltered late. PIROLI bumped with inner rival leaving
the gate, chased three deep and steadied off heels midway around first turn, closed in around the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, could not
summon the needed rally in the final furlong but kept on for a minor award. UNION TRAIN forwardly placed outside the top trio four deep into the first turn,
dropped back off the pace around the bend but remained four wide, lost ground around the second bend while in the four path and weakened in the stretch.
KEROUAC stalked the pace from inside, saved ground to the stretch and faded. Q B ONE tossed his head briefly soon after the start, chased between rivals
then got shuffled back at the three-eighths pole, trailed two wide into the lane and had little left.

Footnotes
UNFAITHFUL WAYS broke a step slow, tucked inside on the first turn, moved closer between rivals on the backstretch, angled out into the stretch, rallied
outside the top pair and drove past to prove best. ROPERS N WRANGLERS set the pace under pressure early then cleared up the backstretch, led a bit off
the rail into the stretch, met the challenge from SPRING SPINNING entering the final furlong, held that foe at bay but could not fend off the rally from
UNFAITHFUL WAYS in deep stretch. TEAM CONCEPT stalked the pace from inside, coaxed leaving the backstretch, got raced in a bit tight at the
three-eighths pole, remained inside to the stretch, finished willingly under left-handed encouragement and gained the show. SPRING SPINNING hopped
slightly and came away slow at the start, chased three deep early, remained three wide into the lane, bid outside with a furlong remaining but lacked the
needed late punch and got edged for the show. SQUILLIONS broke a step slow, steadied briefly crossing the finish line for the first time, raced near the
back early on, checked and avoided injured rival at the five-eighths pole, entered the far turn between runners, came three wide into the stretch and could
not rally. SWEET WORKOUT broke a bit slow, unhurried in the early going and moved inside, tipped out late on the far turn, moved out further in the stretch
and failed to menace. ARDIS showed speed but pulled early, around the first turn and into the backstretch, taken back at the nine-sixteenths pole, chased
two wide into the drive and weakened. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) broke out, tracked two wide around the first turn, could not avoid making contact with
injured rival and checked at the five-eighths pole, came five wide into the lane and was not persevered with. ROYALLY COMMAND chased in the two path,
became rough gated into the backstretch, sustained an injury at the five-eighths pole and unseated the rider and was vanned off following the race.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT BETWEEN ROYALLY COMMAND AND THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) AT THE FIVE-EIGHTHS
POLE, NO CHANGE WAS MADE.

Footnotes
TAKE A LEAP fanned four wide into the first turn, moved closer four deep early on the backstretch, ranged up three wide on the far turn, cleared in upper
stretch and drew off under right-handed urging and steady handling. HOT ON THE TRAIL pressed from outside early then moved up to duel on the
backstretch, inched ahead on the far turn, put away inside rival near the quarter pole then fought with the winner into the stretch, could not kick on with that
rival in upper stretch and stayed on to secure second. BEST OF SHOW stalked on the inside, moved off the rail on the backstretch, angled out and came
four deep into the stretch and ran on for the show. ZABAVA was in a bit tight between runners two then three wide and was ridden cautiously late on the first
turn, entered the lane three deep and failed to threaten while earning a minor award. BOSSY SOUL broke a bit slow and took up at the start, angled down to
the inside, saved ground to the stretch, tipped out in the lane and could not rally. DISCRETE STEVIE B showed speed from the rail, set the pace under
pressure early then dueled in the middle stages, fought back on the far turn then lost touch with a quarter mile left to run and weakened.
FLATTERWITHJEWELS was a bit fractious in the gate, stalked off the inside, lost ground on the far turn and entered the stretch between rivals and faded.
GOTTA BE LUCKY raced three deep around the first turn, dropped back to last up the backstretch, angled in and saved ground on the far turn and was not
a factor. BIG PASSION traveled four then five wide near the back early, remained well off the rail up the backstretch, entered the second turn five wide,
angled down to the three path and tired.

Footnotes
THRUMPS DREAM (IRE) off slow to begin, went two wide around the first turn, closed in three wide or three deep on the far turn, challenged from outside
and took over in upper stretch and lasted over the late bid from CARPE VINUM on the line. CARPE VINUM settled inside, tipped out a bit but was caught in
tight quarters and had to check at the half-mile pole, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, rallied and drew alongside with a sixteenth remaining
and missed on the line. CHARGES DROPPED stalked along the inside, put in a rail bid in upper stretch and got outkicked by the top pair. HEATHERS
GREY bobbled leaving the gate, sped to the front from inside, showed the way a bit off the rail into the drive, lost command in upper stretch and flattened to
fourth. OLE SILVER closest in pursuit in the two path to the far turn, pushed upon around the bend but lacked room past the quarter pole, angled to the
inside in the stretch and could not rally. NEW HEAT off slow to begin, lagged behind and steered inside, went around a rival on the far turn and failed to
threaten. SHORE BREAK (IRE) tracked off the rail then outside a rival, steadied off heels between rivals past the half-mile pole, angled to the rail around the
far turn, tired and eased in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
GERLACH'S was off a bit slow to begin, coaxed up the backstretch, raced three wide leaving the turn, then swung out in upper stretch, drifted in some while

the turn, led into the stretch, lost command in upper stretch but fought back from inside, regained the lead late but got nailed at the wire. SQUALOTORO sat
off the pace, gained four wide around the turn, bid four deep with a quarter mile left to run, took control in upper stretch, vied between foes late and was
edged by the top pair in a blanket finish. SUZIE QZZ BROTHER chased between runners, got shuffled early on the turn, wen two to three wide into the
stretch, angled out the steered back inward in the lane and flattened out. BIG FLAME stumbled a bit leaving the gate then dropped back, steered to the
inside, exited the bend two wide, came out in the stretch and improved position. QUICK BUCK broke inward, chased inside to the stretch, tipped out in the
lane and lacked late response. STIR THE POT sped clear quickly, showed the way up the backstretch, challenged midway around the bend, vied inside into

Footnotes
CURRENT MOOD chased the leader three deep up the backstretch, took aim three wide entering the stretch, drew alongside ROUBAIX at the eighth pole
and surged clear under hand urging. ROUBAIX away quickly from outside, cleared the field and crossed over to the inside, pressured from outside leaving
the backstretch, maintained a short lead through the turn, cleared at the top of the stretch but was soon challenged by CURRENT MOOD entering the final
furlong, yielded to the winner in midstretch and stayed on to best the rest. BUSKER ALLIE lacked early speed, went outside a rival entering the turn but got
forced out when TAPIT ROCKS lugged out early on the bend, entered the stretch five wide and summoned a mild rally for the show. GALARINA forwardly
placed early three deep then moved up to press from outside, remained alongside the leader on the turn, then lost touch with that rival at the top of the
stretch, flattened in the late stages and lost the show. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL got crowded between rivals early, sat off the pace up the backstretch, went
three deep on the turn then came four wide into the stretch and could not rally. IT'S GREEK TO ME chased out of range early, saved ground through the
turn, angled out then shifted back inward in the stretch and failed to threaten. DIALING SCOTTY chased along the inside, steadied off the heels of the
leader early, saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail in the lane and faded. TAPIT ROCKS broke slow, climbed crossing the dirt, lugged out entering
the turn and had the rider take up, came back to the inside, then had to checked again along the rail late. ACT OF SERENDIPITY tracked between early
and around the turn, lacked room past the five-sixteenths pole and flattened in the stretch. SHEZ OUR ARCH allowed to settle in the early going, went three
deep into the turn and got forced out by inner rivals and could not make an impact afterwards. SUMMER PUDDING chased between early then had to
steady at the nine-sixteenths pole, continued between rivals leaving the backstretch, was getting out and had the rider take hold at the quarter pole and
flattened in the lane.
