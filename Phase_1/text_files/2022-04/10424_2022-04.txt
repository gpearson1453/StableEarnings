Footnotes
TRAFFIC STOPPER engaged with RAMONCITA LIGHT to dispute the early pace, shook free of that rival leaving the bend, was confronted by ST. ANNIE'S
INDY approaching the eighth pole, dueled with that foe to the wire and dug in to prevail. ST. ANNIE'S INDY tracked the pace from the inside, advanced in
upper stretch, took a narrow lead into the final furlong, dueled with the winner through the lane and was gamely bested in the end, while clear for second.
SEASIDE DANCER stalked the pace three deep on the turn, was roused in upper stretch, closed ground in the final sixteenth but could not reel in the top
pair and was a clear third. SLEW OF FASHION lacked early speed, gained ground nearing the quarter marker and finished evenly in the drive. JUMPING
JILL FLASH stalked the pace four wide on the turn and gave way. RAMONCITA LIGHT broke alertly, disputed the early pace with TRAFFIC STOPPER,
drifted a bit on the turn into the three path, was overtaken into the stretch run and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
CONTINENTAL UNION broke sharply and was sent to set moderate fractions, extended the lead leaving the turn and drew clear while kept to task in the
final stages. BERNIE'S BIG BOY saved ground while stalking the early pace, was outkicked in the stretch run but kept on in the end to be a clear second
over the rest. CAJUN BETTOR tracked the early pace three wide, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and lacked a final
bid. HARDY CHISEL chased the pace four wide into the stretch run and weakened in the final stages. HAWK'S RISING chased the pace three wide on the
turn and tired in the drive. GOBSMACK tracked the pace, was three wide between rivals on the turn and faded in the stretch. AIGLE was unprepared at the
start and spotted the field several lengths, was steered three wide into the stretch run and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FRIDAY'S AT SHADY saved ground while just off of the pace, advanced along the inside nearing the quarter marker, took command into the final furlong,
was confronted in the late stages by FAR WEST and dug in to hold off that foe for the win. FAR WEST stalked the pace, was roused four wide on the far
turn, came within aim in midstretch, continued to close in the final stages but could not get by the determined winner in the end, while besting the rest.
KNOWN settled off of the pace, was steered five wide into the stretch run, rallied in the late going and just got up for third in the final strides. SUNNY SPOT
bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, advanced four wide into the drive and just missed for third in the end.
HYDROGEN tracked the moderate pace, gained ground three wide between foes while in tight on the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch, weakened
in the final stages and was just edged for third. HARBOR KITTY broke alertly and was sent to the front early on, set moderate fractions, came under

Footnotes
BANDERA AZTECA settled just off of the early pace, advanced along the inside on the turn to stalk the pace, angled out in upper stretch, closed well in the
final furlong and had a good late kick to draw clear in the end. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM bobbled at the start, was a bit green in the early stages, was taken
three wide outside of rivals on the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, took command leaving the eighth pole, could not hold off the fast closing winner in
the end but was best of the rest. RHODIUM RUNNER was hustled leaving the break and set contested early fractions, edged to a clear lead nearing the
quarter marker, was confronted approaching the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages, while clear of the rest for third. I GOT SPEED chased the
early pace, was floated out a bit nearing the half-mile marker, was two wide along the turn and lacked a late rally. FULL OF LIFE was away well, tracked the
early pace, could not match strides leaving the turn and tired in the stretch run.

BANDEENA broke alertly and was hustled to the front, set the pace while being prompted into the second turn, was put to steady encouragement through
the lane and was clear at the end. SUGAR KISSES was content to settle early on, was roused five wide into the stretch run, closed fast in the final furlong
and won the nod for second in the final strides. LIAM'S SECRET bumped NICOLE GRACE leaving the start, was forwardly placed early on while three wide,
gained ground in upper stretch, was outfinished in the late stages and was just edged out for second. NICOLE GRACE was bumped at the start by LIAM'S
SECRET, recovered to settle off of the early pace, was steered three wide into the stretch run and lacked a late response. GOOD TIME DOLLY was sent
leaving the break and took back into the first turn to track the pace, prompted the fractions into the second turn, came under a ride in upper stretch and gave
way in the late going. PREMIUMONSATURDAY settled off of the early pace, advanced along the inside on the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and
weakened in the final stages.

WAR GAMES was hustled leaving the gate, quickly took command of the pace and set quick fractions through the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch
and pulled away in the end. IN OUR A tracked the fast early pace, could not match strides with the winner leaving the turn and was outfinished in the final
stages, while clear of the rest for second. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) chased the fast pace four wide on the turn, was outkicked in the stretch run but kept on in
the end to get the nod for third. HEY MATE chased the pace from a ground saving path through the turn and gave way in the drive. EXCLUSIVE SPEAKER
lacked early speed and was not a factor. LET'S REJOYCE took back early on to stalk the fast pace, lost position three wide on the turn and faded in the
drive.

REBALATION was allowed to settle early on, was roused four wide into the drive, closed fast in the final furlong and drew clear in the end in an impressive
run. MAYBE I WILL was sent leaving the start and showed good early speed while setting fast fractions, edged to a clear lead nearing the furlong grounds,
was overhauled by the winner in the final sixteenth but held for second in the end. DO YOU HEAR THAT tracked the fast early pace from the inside,
advanced in upper stretch but was outfinished in the final stages, while clear of the rest for third. EMPIRE HOUSE stalked the pace three deep, lost position
nearing the furlong marker and did not mount a late rally. TIP TOP GAL chased the pace two wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run. IMA HAPPY CAT
pressed the fast pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
DARK PRINCE hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to sit just off of the early pace, was roused four wide into the stretch run, confronted
JEDI KNIGHT inside of the furlong marker, battled with that foe and dug in in the final strides to prevail. JEDI KNIGHT stalked the early pace from a three
wide path, mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, took a narrow lead nearing the eighth pole, was confronted by DARK PRINCE inside of the furlong
marker, battled against that rival and was bested in the end, while clear for second. ALLEYCAT was allowed to settle in the early going, was steered five
wide on the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, the rider lost his crop nearing the sixteenth-marker, closed well in the final stages and was up in
time to claim third. UNPOSSIBLE was sent leaving the break and set the pace while on a clear lead, was confronted by JEDI KNIGHT nearing the furlong
marker, ceded the lead to that rival and weakened in the late going, while just missing for third. EARNEST was never far back in the early going, threw his
head along the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn two wide, came back on in the stretch, continued to be hard to place in the late stages and
was outfinished in the end, while challenging for third. FOUR O'FIVE tracked the moderate pace from the inside, lost position in upper stretch and gave way
in the final stages. INVERTIGO settled off of the pace while saving ground in the early stages, was steered three wide on the second turn and did not offer a
late response. TOUGH IT OUT was off a bit slowly and was unhurried early, saved ground while trailing through the second turn and was not a factor.
