was gaining late. PANZER PRIDE failed to menace in an even effort. PAISLEY'S VISION led early, showed speed to the turn and gave way. JUSTIN

BEYOND AWESOME got away alertly, led throughout, drew off in the drive under mild left handed urging and won handily. NATURAL IMMUNITY chased
the pace, went seven wide at the top of the stretch, failed to gain and was no match for the winner. SCATALICIOUS was reluctant to load, broke in, went
eight wide at the top of the stretch and raced greenly. ARIZONA KALEI hesitated at the start to be off slowly and failed to menace in an even effort. LITTLE
AXE SOUL was in tight at the start and outrun. RAGING RIVER was in tight at the start and outrun.

Footnotes
PARTY POLICE set a pressured pace to mid stretch and inched clear under urging. AWESOME LADY raced between horses to the turn, bid willingly and
yielded near the eighth pole to finish second best. SWEET LADY LANA pressed the pace while racing three across, swung six wide leaving the turn, fell
back and settled for show. CORAGEOUSCHRISTINE was fractious in the gate, slow early, closed mid track and improved position. ARIZONA BREW
showed good early speed, saved ground and lacked a stretch response. ROCKIN IN veered out at the start, raced outside, went nine wide at the top of the
stretch and lacked a bid. MISCHIEVOUS EFFORT broke awkwardly and was steadied at the start, advanced to the turn, swung wide and dropped back.
DYNAMIC WOMAN was not a factor. MY NAME IS INDY was outrun.
