Footnotes
KATY AND EMMA was urged to the lead outside a rival into the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, widened that margin on the far turn,
then shook clear racing through the stretch while being kept to firm encouragement. FABIOLA PRINCESS was rated just off the second flight to the
backstretch, tipped out three wide racing into the stretch and proved best of the others. THAWED, urged to a forward placing tracking just outside the
pacesetter, continued in pursuit of that foe to the far turn and faded into upper stretch. LADY MANHATTAN broke awkwardly, was settled between foes in
the last flight and never gained contention. AWESOME WINNA, reserved outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, failed to menace thereafter.
SOK FURY flashed brief pace prompting a rival along the inside to the backstretch and gave way after a half. MARYMOTHEROF JESUS angled to the
inside early but proved no factor.

Footnotes
KINGSWOOD, in touch with the first flight between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, gained a narrow advantage nearing upper stretch,
forged clear in upper stretch and widened late under pressure. NORTH CAUCASUS broke readily, was rated tracking off the first flight inside a rival racing
to the bend, tipped out in upper stretch, then altered course three wide nearing the furlong marker but continued with some late momentum to secure the
place honors between foes. THE SKIPSTER tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch and
continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. EDMUND FITZGERALD broke readily, prompted the pace three wide through the backstretch, then into
the lane and gave way midstretch. M V SPEED, urged inside foes disputing the pace while angling to the inside racing into the turn, emptied out in the drive.
O DANNY BOY settled off the second flight racing a bit off the inside but failed to menace. REGAL EAGLE trailed.

Footnotes
NOICATTARO angled inwards in early stages while being rated between foes behind the second flight, conceded some position nearing the far turn while
continuing under patient handling, advanced to contention just off the inside nearing upper stretch, came through tight quarters splitting rivals near the inside
leaving midstretch and edged away to a clear advantage in time under firm handling. CHEF MENTEUR angled to the rail stalking just off the leaders racing
to the backstretch, continued under reserve awaiting an opening racing into the far turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper stretch while advancing to
challenge but was outkicked. LYING JEFF, urged prompting the pace outside a rival in the opening half, dueled for command on the far turn into the stretch
but yielded to the top pair late. HE'SSOSUBTLE tracked off the first flight outside a rival, was fanned four wide entering the lane and weakened in the drive.
FEDERAL OFFENSE was urged along the rail disputing the pace from the outset, dueled into upper stretch and gave way late. URBAN BEACH settled
inside foes racing to the backstretch, was held up momentarily racing into the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick. EL
POLICIA was rated behind rivals in second flight racing to the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but lacked a rally. AS DE ORO COCO
hesitated, then hopped at the start to break well behind the field and passed only tiring rivals late. BALLINDERRY settled into stride off the inside early and
proved no factor. SOLAR SHIELD, pulling hard against restraint racing three wide to the backstretch, emptied out early.

MALIBU MAX was rated tracking off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, angled inwards on the far turn, came through inside the pacesetter to
challenge for command leaving the quarter mile marker and edged clear in the closing stages under firm handling. CHILL HAZE was urged inside a rival
disputing the pace to the backstretch, tipped off the rail while edging forward on the far turn, resisted the winner's bid past midstretch but proved only
second best. WHISTLE ME HOME settled last to the far turn, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch and made some belated progress. KRAMDEN
settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch and continued evenly between foes to late stages. INTERNET OF THINGS was urged prompting the
pace outside a rival to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. BODIE CODY tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight but gave way nearing
the far turn.

Footnotes
DIVINE CONTROL was rated between foes in the opening stages, tipped out three wide entering the backstretch to track the leaders in second flight, was
prompted to advance on the far turn while being fanned four wide nearing upper stretch but continued with a steady late response to prevail in time under
firm handling. SOAKING WET angled to the rail tracking just off the leaders in the opening half, briefly awaited an opening nearing the second bend, came
through inside the leaders to challenge for command nearing upper stretch, struck the front midstretch but was outkicked. THE DUNGEON, off last, was
settled into stride, saved ground steadily gaining position nearing upper stretch, bid along the rail leaving the furlong marker but lacked the needed final kick.
FEISTY KITTEN, reserved near the inside to the backstretch, shifted outside foes after a half, advanced four, then five wide through the far turn to upper
stretch but continued with a mild gain. OUR GREY GHOST angled inwards a bit to track off the first flight between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance racing into upper stretch but came up empty late. FORMAL TREASURE settled into stride off the inside racing to the backstretch and never proved
a threat. THE WILD FLYER, roused from the break to gain terms with a rival on the pace, was urged prompting that rival's pace to the far turn and gave way
into the lane. DYNAMORE was urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset to the second bend, shifted off the rail racing through the far turn and
gave way. SECLUDE proved no factor.

Footnotes
HOT OMELET swerved out at the start losing position to the field, was collected by her rider while angling nearer the inside on the backstretch, gathered
momentum on the turn, swung five wide racing into upper stretch and rallied sharply to the front to wrest the advantage in time under pressure. FABULOUS
PHILLY, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the pacesetter, advanced in that path to challenge for command leaving midstretch but was outkicked.
BAYOU MELODY, urged inside rivals prompting the pace through the backstretch into the turn, moved to wrest the advantage nearing upper stretch, edged
forward racing past the furlong marker but failed to sustain that momentum. IT IS WHAT IT IS was settled off the second flight early, angled in to save
ground on the turn to the lane and continued with an effort to improve position. WHITEROSE SPIRIT tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight in
early, tipped out racing into the turn and soon gave way. GIO'S MY DAD proved no factor. AMOR COCO was urged to the lead in the opening stages racing
a bit off the rail into the turn and gave way between foes entering upper stretch.

CLEVER FELLOW, reserved last racing to the first turn, gained position inside rivals after a half, tipped out racing through the far turn to split foes nearing
upper stretch, shifted out three wide entering upper stretch and produced a solid late response to wrest command and go clear under firm left handed
pressure. JOE PHILLIPS, bumped at the start, pulled his way along the inside tracking just off the leaders, then between foes into the backstretch,
advanced on the pacesetter to challenge racing through the far turn, gained a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. LUIS TWO GUNS broke awkwardly while losing position to the field, angled to the inside entering the first turn while making a
sharp advance to contention inside foes nearing the backstretch, steadied nearing the five furlong marker, continued along the inside to the far turn, then
tipped out in the closing stages to edge rivals for a share. HOLIDAY DANCER was urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage in the
opening stages, set pace to the far turn and gave way midstretch. NIP OF BOURBON tracked off the first flight three wide in early stages, made some brief
progress in that path after a half but soon emptied out. WILD IRISHMAN angled inwards a bit tracking off the first flight between foes, shifted out avoiding
close quarters entering the backstretch ducking into the path of GFRIDAY, was caught four wide racing into the far turn and offered no rally. RAMIRIN was
rated between foes racing to the first turn and dropped back early. G FRIDAY, forced wide racing to the backstretch, soon retreated. OHANA EMPIRE broke
inwards bumping JOE PHILLIPS, was righted to briefly prompt the pacesetter but gave way midway through the backstretch. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START OF LUIS TWO GUNS BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

CODETOWIN was rated just out of striking distance near the inside in the opening stages, saved ground through the turn gathering momentum, tipped out
splitting rivals entering upper stretch, took over leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. NOVGOROD THE GREAT was urged inside foes
disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch but proved no match when
confronted by the winner. WELD was rated off the first flight while shifting out four wide on the backstretch, advanced in that path through the turn to upper
stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. FIRSTCADETE ducked in at the start losing position to the field, settled into stride racing to the
turn, saved ground to upper stretch and made an effort to improve his position. ELLAS MY LOVE settled well off the leaders in early stages, swung five wide
racing into upper stretch and gained some position while making no real impression. FORWARD MOTION was urged pressing the pace three wide between
foes through the backstretch, continued to press the issue to upper stretch and gave way in the drive. ARCADIA CALLS flashed brief pace between foes but
faded from conention early. DOCTOR K joined the pace four wide in early stages, dueled for command in that path into the turn and gave way abruptly after
a half.

TWISTED TREASURE was reserved dropping out of striking distance while angling inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum racing to
the far turn, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch, then reeled in SASSY CAT to go clear in time under firm right handed pressure. The latter joined
the pace three wide leaving the chute, angled inwards forcing the pace into the first turn, went clear on the backstretch, held sway on a comfortable margin
past midstretch but couldn't fend off the winner. GOODBYE CAROLINA angled to the inside tracking the pacesetter to the backstretch, tipped out nearing
the far turn to advance on the leader between foes nearing upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SUNNYMEDE DREAM settled between foes
racing to the backstretch, then made an effort to improve her position near the inside in late stages. AUDRINA'S CITY settled last racing to the far turn,
saved ground to the stretch and passed inside some tiring rivals. CIDSTAYINURLAINE, away awkwardly, never gained contention. AMERICAN EMPRESS,
pulling between foes racing to the first turn, shifted out three wide racing to the backstretch and soon retreated. THUNDER BUGGY tipped outside a rival
racing to the first turn, then angled back to the rail tracking the pacesetter along the inside on the backstretch but proved empty in the drive. GOLDEN
OLDIE, urged to a forward placing between foes, emptied out early.
