MACHO MADNESS stalked the leaders from along the inside through the first pair of turns, angled out going to the far turn to bid four wide then edged clear
under steady handling. BUD MINISTER stalked the early pace four wide, moved three wide to challenge through the final turn but could not go with the
winner late. DAYS OF GLORY made the pace on a pressured lead along the inside and was worn down through the lane. HE HAD A SECRET lacked a
rally two and three wide. CHARED was not a threat. TAP A MIRACLE was always back. SOUL READY was not a factor. PREFERRED PROSPECT
prompted the pace and gave way in the final turn.

ITS A DEAL showed the most early speed to move to a clear lead inside, opened the advantage into the far turn then held safe through the lane under
steady handling. THE BIG SHOW tracked the winner two or three wide in reach but could not close the gap in the lane. CHISMOSO moved up three wide
but could not threaten in the lane. JONO floated out into the first turn, settled four wide and tired. LEFT BEHIND saved ground and was not a factor. FAST
MISCHIEF was always back. SAW THE SUNRISE tired two and three wide.

ADDISYN K dueled on the pace outside POSSIBLY IN LOVE to the far turn, was joined by the winner into the lane and could not go with that one. JOY

the pace out from the rail and inside MISS ADDISYN K to the far turn and weakened into the lane. BEE MERRY saved ground and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
LADDIE BOY stalked the early leaders inside to bid and move clear into the second turn, shook free nearing the lane and drew off while kept to urging.
KNOWYOUROPTIONS contested the early pace out from the rail, continued just off the winner to the far turn and could not keep pace while holding clear
for the place. HOLIDAY JOKE saved ground to move up and just gain the show late. SCOOTER'S BOY stalked the pace three and four wide in reach but
could not hold position in the lane. THETRASHMANSCOMING settled two and three wide and could not threaten late. ACCOUSTICAL was not a factor.
RANDOM AFFAIR was with the early pace three wide and tired. GRAN EDITION trailed.
