PAGEANT PRINCESS forced the pace outside, edged to front at the quarter pole then edged clear following a long drive. EIGHTY EIGHT KEYS stalked the
dueling leaders three wide, bid in the stretch but could not get by the winner. ONE PAIR OF HANDS settled inside the pacesetters, angled out in the stretch
and made a mild gain. DUNE JUMPER earned a narrow advantage inside for half a mile and came up empty. MELITZA dropped far behind after the start
then offered some late energy. ECLIPTICALS SHORTY lacked speed and weakened steadily.

for the win. CRAZY SERENA chased three wide early on, moved up on the turn, rallied outside entering the stretch, bid at the eighth pole, dug in gamely
outside in the final sixteenth but second best. TOURING MARYANNE bobbled at the break, raced off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, came four
wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside for third. CICI UNIFIED was reluctant to load, chased two wide, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. DIVINE
TWIST raced off the pace inside, came two wide into the lane and had no rally. PRINCESS EMMA JO raced off the pace, came three wide into the stretch
and tired. WHAT'S COOKIN chased inside and faded.

steady advance outside to gain the place while no threat to the winner. KODAPENDENT trailed for half a mile, moved very wide on the final turn and closed
well. ESOR hustled to a clear lead outside then weakened through the stretch. ALPHA SIXTY SIX prompted pace the outside then proved empty in the

STARSHIP CHARLY stalked close up early, tracked between rivals on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied between rivals, dueled through the
final sixteenth and surged late for the victory. FRIEDER FANATIC chased two wide, then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied
outside, dueled in deep stretch and dug in gamely to the finish. ORB'S PARTY GIRL set the pace, raced in the two path turning for home, dueled through
the final furlong and dug in gamely inside of rival to the wire. DECISIVE CAUSE chased on the inside, rode the rail into the stretch, bid at the eighth pole
and then was outkicked. ARDEAN was off slowly, raced off the rail, off the pace and did not factor. VEINTE showed brief speed outside, dropped back at
the half mile marker and gave way.

wide, edged clear in midstretch but was outfinished. SHETALKSTOMUCH chased outside off the leaders, swung wider in the stretch rallying. PRINCESS
KAIRA dropped well behind then passed rivals without menacing. GOING GOING GONE prompted the pace outside, led briefly at the quarter pole then
faded in the stretch. IOVA dropped back between rivals and was never a factor. SEIZE THE WHISKEY hustled to a narrow advantage inside then stopped
in the stretch. RISQUE'S JEWEL chased three wide and was always far behind.

Footnotes
FOREST FIRE stalked close up outside, bid three wide on the turn, put a head in front at the furlong marker, dug in gamely outside and held on
determinedly for the win. TOWN JAK chased two wide, then raced inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in upper stretch, dug in gamely inside and battled to
the wire. KADENS COURAGE showed good speed outside rivals to set the pace, dueled into the stretch, dug in between rivals and battled gamely to the
finish. MACH TRIAL chased between rivals, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. FROSTED INDIAN was off a bit slow, raced off the pace
between rivals, angled out on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. DECKOLOGY raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten.
SILVER FURY raced three wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT stalked the pacesetters four wide, bid to the front near midstretch and prevailed in a long drive. HIGHTIME VALENTINE settled
inside the dueling leaders, moved wide on the turn, loomed a threat but made a gradual gain. BLUNT FORCE lacked speed, advanced along the rail and
closed well too late. ORIGINALY FROM DOT raced close up outside early, took over midway on the turn then weakened late. OCEANO ROSSO broke
slowest then rushed to a narrow lead and was finished after the half. ZENSATIONAL DIXIE lagged far behind then reduced the margin without menacing.
STORMBEAM dropped far behind and narrowed the gap while no menace. FAST INTENTIONS dueled along the inside, led briefly into the far turn and
stopped abruptly.

made a six wide run at the quarter pole, rallied outside to the lead in midstretch, then dug in gamely to the finish. STONEHARBOR BLONDE dueled three
wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, led into the lane, dug in and weakened late. INTERVENTION dueled two wide for command, dueled on the turn and
tired. QUEEN ABARRIO dueled four wide for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. ALMOST EVIL was outrun early and passed tired rivals. PRESTO
CHANGE O was outrun early and failed to threaten. HEY DEWZPOTS chased on the rail, lacked room entering the stretch and steadied while tiring. MY
