NICE WEATHER set the pace while clear early in the two path, drew out leaving the turn and held sway late to prove best under a drive. NEW HIRE stalked
the early pace from between rivals, then was three wide on the turn, came in slightly by the three sixteenths, then was corrected and angled out and closed
full of run to be getting to the winner late. FED CHAIR stalked the early pace four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn but flattened out. CRITICAL
THINKING broke outwardly at the start, was rated along early, advanced four wide on the turn and had no late kick. JUMP FREE was outrun early and
lacked a rally. NAZARENO was hard used early on the inside under strong urging and stopped.
