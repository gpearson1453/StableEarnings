FAIT ACCOMPLI settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a
sixteenth to run and quickly drew off. BUHM'S CANDY BOY was away in good order to be just off the leaders from the inside, checked nearing the
three-eighths marker, angled out five-wide through the second turn, rallied with good courage but could not match strides with the winner.
DAREABIGDREAM lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, gained command with a furlong to run and gave way in the drive. SILVER
KID was off a step slow, lagged early, saved ground through the second turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished willingly. LUCKY CHAMP pressed the
pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. FLYING CHARLIE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going
three-quarters. MR BUG Z raced four-wide through the first turn, set a pressured pace for six furlongs and weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
STARLIGHT TWIST raced unhurried early, advanced four-wide through the second turn, reached the fore inside the sixteenth marker and was going away
late. NOUMEA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a late bid.
WILLING TO BURN chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin and
gave way late. AMERICAN ROYALTY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, checked nearing the sixteenth pole and
finished willingly when clear. SOJOURNER TRUTH showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. RED DAHLIA
sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened after going three-quarters. FOXY CARMELA was pulled up after going a half
and walked off. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
FIRST STRING was away in good order to duel for the early advantage, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and held off the closing
FULL VELOCITY to prevail. FULL VELOCITY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with good
late energy. RANCHER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. RISE UP
MOSCOW was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. LUCKY CHANCE showed no early speed, raced
five-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. JUNGLE ROAR dueled for the lead from between foes, moved four-wide through the turn and
weakened. BIG TONY vied for the lead from the inside for a half and weakened. INFATUATE settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually
weakened. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
