Footnotes
FEEL THE GLORY , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, eased out to the three path turning for home, swept to command approaching the eighth
pole and pulled away under urging. INSTPARTY , three wide entering the turn, moved over to the two path approaching the stretch, gained the lead at the
head of the lane and weakened in the drive. PARTY MONSTER saved ground around the turn, bore out in front of MISS SECUCTIVE approaching the
sixteenth pole and finished evenly. CHARLYS WILD ANGEL , four wide on the turn, floated to the five path turning for home, raced outside horses and
passed tired ones. MISS SEDUCTIVE , a bit rank at the break, saved ground on the turn, angled off the rail in upper stretch, gave way and steadied to avoid
the heels of PARTY MONSTER approaching the sixteenth pole. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE , steered to the inner rail after sprinting clear mid way down the
backstretch, set the pace along the rail and gave way in upper stretch. BARB THE BOSS unseated her rider and ran off about a quarter mile before the
race, chased the early pace, gave way on the turn and was eased. Following a stewards' inquiry, PARTY MONSTER was disqualified and fifth for impeding
MISS SEDUCTIVE approaching the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
HAD THE NOTION , forwardly placed inside foes early, eased back off the leaders into the turn and allowed a duel to develop, dropped in to save ground
under some rating past the three eighths, angled four wide into the lane, closed in under right handed asking, forged to command heading to the sixteenth
marker, kicked clear and was steadily hand ridden through the final seventy yards. PRINCESS ADIRA broke a step slow, regrouped and moved up a bit
while saving ground nearing the five eighths, dropped back some into the turn, eased off the rail and came under pressure, shifted five wide with momentum
into the lane, failed to kick on with the winner but continued on willingly to progress and gain the place in the final yards. RAVENEL tracked the pace outside
rivals, moved up and bid three deep around the far turn, dueled, took command soon into the lane, spurted clear under a drive in mid stretch the gave way
grudgingly. GRACE ISABELLA was sent clear early, set the pace towards the rail, was joined by a pair of runners entering the turn, battled around the turn
and into the lane, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded late. WIN THEN GRIN prompted the pace off the inside, moved up between rivals into the
far turn and challenged for command, sparred to upper stretch, chased after others cleared then weakened very late. NATIONALIST bobbled at the break,
dropped off the pace in the opening furlong and failed to respond.

TORRE BRANCA , four deep around the turn, challenged for the lead outside UTTERLY COURAGEOUS in upper stretch, dueled with that one and got the
bob. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS , a forward factor in the three path around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, dueled inside the winner and just
missed. VODKATINI stalked the pace racing in the two path on the turn, angled out near the eighth pole and failed to menace in an even effort. GREAT
BARONESS , unruly in the post parade, was sent to the early lead, set the pace in the two path around the turn and tired in the drive. THREE
SHAMROCKS hugged the inner rail, chased the pace for the three furlongs, raced on his left lead in the stretch and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MOODY WOMAN , patiently handled in range while about three wide, took aim as a duel developed mid turn, angled five wide into the lane, closed nicely
under steady hand encouragement, put a head in front with a furlong remaining, was roused once then pulled away under a hand ride. NOBLE BID pulled
his to command outside BANDITS WARRIOR then went clear, dropped in and was joined by a pair of rivals leaving the far turn, dueled, lost a bit of ground
nearing the lane, battled back inside foes to threaten in mid stretch, continued with good energy but was second best. BANDITS WARRIOR sped to the
early lead, set the pace towards the rail, eased back off foes leaving the far turn, chased past the five sixteenths, came back out leaving mid stretch and
finished willingly. FUHGEDDABOUDIT prompted the pace off the rail, bid between foes leaving the far turn, dueled on a short lead past the five sixteenths,
kept on battling past the furlong grounds then faded late. SWEET GRACIE , off slow when rank at the break, checked soon after, regrouped then rolled up
four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, sparred three deep past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. MO FIRE
came out at the break, dropped off the pace, raced three wide in upper stretch and failed to respond.

JEMISON , fractious behind the gate, bobbled at the start, quickly recovered and pulled her way forward four wide outside rivals heading to the five eighths,
tracked the leader under confident handling, moved to apply more pressure mid turn, secured command soon into the lane, spurted clear with a furlong
remaining, eagerly widened after some left handed rousing then was taken in hand through the final yards. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE quickly to the front, set
the pace towards the inside, was joined by the winner leaving the three eighths, held that one off to the head of the lane, battled on to about mid stretch then
gave way grudgingly and saved the place. MUTASALLEM , in the clear chasing the leaders, raced four wide under a ride in upper stretch but lacked a
serious response. FRIGHTLAND , off slow after hopping and bumping with HOFBURG PLACE, rated four wide outside a rival nearing the half mile marker,
shifted in some and came on with some late interest. HOFBURG PALACE , bumped at the break, was outrun. DIVINING DANCER dropped back early.

Footnotes
SHINY PENNY had speed outside rivals and was rated back a bit to track the duel, took closer order leaving the five sixteenths, bid four wide outside
runners to take command in upper stretch, kicked clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under solid handling turned away an inside
challenge from SPECIAL FREEDOM. SPECIAL FREEDOM bobbled at the break, recovered and moved up to be in the clear off the embattled leaders,
rushed up to the inside of the winner around the far turn, was hemmed in a bit three wide nearing the quarter pole, ranged up nearing the eighth pole,
shifted in and closed the gap. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS lacked speed while off the rail, circled four wide into the lane and closed steadily. HAPPYLIFE
broke a step slow, rated well off the early pace while saving ground, swung out wide for the drive and had belated action. MEXICALI ROSE dueled two wide
outside MOON BIZ, held a slim lead past the five sixteenths, ceded the lead in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. MOON BIZ got engaged in a duel
to the inside of MEXICALI ROSE soon after the break, sparred for a half mile then retreated.
