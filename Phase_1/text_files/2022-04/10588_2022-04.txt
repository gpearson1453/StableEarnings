Footnotes
EDENS GLORY stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, steadily gained on the leader inside the eighth pole and moved
clear late. PRINCE SHIM set the pace from the two path through the turn, continued with the lead into the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go then
yielded to the winner late. CIRCLE INDY chased the pace along the inside through the turn and offered a mild gain. A LITTLE ECCENTRIC was in the two
or three path through the turn and into the lane and never threatened. PURE TAP saved ground through the turn and into the lane and never factored.

Footnotes
MYERS TIGER pressed the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane, inched to the front just outside the eighth pole, extended the lead to the
sixteenth pole then just lasted. FANCIFIED was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, angled into the seven path when straightening into the
lane then rallied and just missed. APRON STRINGS trailed into the lane from the inside, guided to the six path through the lane while gaining momentum
and was still interested at the end. JILLS PASSION set the pace while under pressure through the turn, continued a serious contender with an eighth to to
go then yielded. GOLDEN COMMAND chased the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane then weakened the final eighth. DICHOTOMY
was never a factor while near the rail. MAJESTIC CLIMB chased the pace from the four path through the turn and into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
LADY FROSTED raced in the three path into the far turn, moved to challenge in mid-turn, gained the lead near the quarter pole, quickly cleared while
straightening into the lane, was urged twice inside the eighth pole then geared down considerably late. KYNANCE (IRE) was in the three or four path into
the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up to be well clear for the place spot while not an serious threat to the winner. BUMBLE OF
LOVE was unhurried while in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the three or four path and moved up without being a serious threat.
JUDY'S WAY was never a threat while racing near the rail. TELLMEONASUNDAY set the pace into the far turn, was under pressure in mid-turn then gave
way into the lane. POLKA POLENTA stalked the pace while in the three path into the far turn, bid into mid-turn then was empty in late turn and was eased
through the lane.

ANNA'S TRIBUTE set the pace at once, raced on a clear lead early, was put under pressure in late turn, repelled that challenge and re-cleared after
straightening in the lane, continued under strong handling to the end to maintain the clear lead. MRSINATRAGLORYLADY was unhurried while in the three
or four path through the turn, angled into the six path for the drive and finished with good energy to be closing in late. WINDOW SHAKER was near the rail
through the turn, moved closest to the winner into the lane then could not gain on that one while finishing clearly best of the rest. MYGIRLJUSTICE was
bumped and bobbled between rivals at the start, raced well back and in the two or three path through the turn, angled into the eight path for the drive and
showed late energy. IMA N H LADY CAT saved ground through the turn and lacked a closing bid. SHE'S NO TOY was in the four path through the turn,
came into the lane from the six path and tired. WRAPPINJUSTICE chased the pace from the three or four path then faded through the final eighth. PRIME N
PROPER broke in at the start and bothered inside foe, raced in the two path through the turn and tired. DON'T BE TURPRIZED pressed the pace two wide
and in the three path through the turn then was empty after turning into the lane. HANDFUL OF CARATS was always last while in the three path.

Footnotes
JOVA chased the three rival duel through the turn, bid after straightening into the lane from the six path, engaged the runner-up outside the eighth pole then
inched to the lead inside the sixteenth pole. TAPIT'S SPIRIT settled off the very early pace, moved up along the inside to vie with two others through the
turn, gained the lead outside the eighth pole, dueled with the winner through the final eighth and could not keep up while turning in a game effort and being
second best. VIVID VERSE chased the duel from the three to four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path, could not keep up with the
top two but kept on well to be clear for the show spot. FIGHT ON vied for the lead from between rivals through the turn then weakened after turning into the
lane. LOST IN LIMBO was near the rail through the turn and into the lane then lacked a response. COUNTER OFFER was never a factor while in the two
path. POWELL never a menace while in the two path. LITTLE KANSAS was off a step slow, saved ground throughout and never was a factor. MR
MANNING vied for the lead from the outset and three wide into the lane then was empty. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
TAPPINTOTHEBEAT set the pace from the two path while clear, continued on a clear advantage through the turn and into the lane then slowly widened
while being kept to the task to the end. BEYOND JUSTICE chased the winner from along the inside through the turn, bid into the lane while still near the
inside, could not gain on the top one through the final eighth and stayed on well. AJIC JAY was in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the
six path, shifted to the eight path inside the eighth pole and finished with good energy to be clear for the show spot. SWEEPINJUSTICE raced in the five to
the four path through the turn when never far back, continued in the six or seven path into the lane and finished evenly. SIGNATURE STREET broke
inwardly, raced in the two path through the turn and lacked a closing bid. LADY STARLIGHT raced in the two or three path through the turn and raced
evenly. NORA'S STAR was never a factor while near the rail. INDY LITES four path through the turn when never far back then tired after straightening in the
lane. ERINS LITTLE MAE chased the winner from the three path through the turn and was empty nearing the eighth pole. HERKINDOFJUSTICE was
bumped solidly and inwardly at the start, raced well back and was never in it. ADDEMUPJUSTICE was outrun while in the three path.
