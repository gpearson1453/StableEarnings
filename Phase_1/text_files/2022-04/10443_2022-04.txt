under heavy urging to prevail. TOAH set most of the pace then battled with JUST A IRISH LAD for the last half but was able to hold on for the place
position. JUST A IRISH LAD pressed the pace from the half pole to the wire from the two path and just missed the place. HUMOR'S REWARD was
unhurried early but proved to be best of the rest. YOUNG SKYWALKER saved ground to no avail. GOSPEL MUSKETEER was allowed to settle but was
