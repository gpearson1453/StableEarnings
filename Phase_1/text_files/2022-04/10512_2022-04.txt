final stages. TALKIN PHAROAH set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane from the rail and gave in during the
final stages. SERGEANT COUNTZLER chased the leaders early on, was in the four path along the turn, in the five path into the lane and weakened late in
the stretch run. LATE SEPTEMBER hopped at the start, chased the early pace, raced in the four path along the turn, in the five path into the lane and
flattened out late in the stretch drive. BAYTOWN GET IT ON took a bad step at the start and was done early. ABINADI ducked in at the start and was
through early. MARIACHI CRUSH was a bit slow at the start and never a factor. REVERE NOTE was always outrun.

Footnotes
GOLDEN VOICE saved ground in midpack early on, moved forward to stalk from the pocket into the far turn, smoothly slipped inside of the pace-setter in
upper stretch to bid for the lead, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds while dueling, and gamely clung to that margin to the wire. DREAMFUL
tugged to a clear advantage into the first turn, showed the way while in the bit and a path off of the rail around both turns, which allowed for GOLDEN
VOICE to produce a rail bid in upper stretch, got headed by that foe at the furlong grounds, sparred on through the late stages as YOUENS menaced
alongside in the late stages, but was denied re-reaching even terms while saving place. YOUENS bumped with an outer foe soon after the start, saved
ground while rating off of the pace, awaited racing room behind the eventual winner around the far turn, tipped two wide entering the lane, then three wide in
upper stretch before forging through rivals to gain show and take aim on the leading pair entering the final furlong, grinded away while steadily progressing
in the late stages, but missed reaching those foes. VIBURNUM trailed while saving ground turning for home, improved inside of foes entering the lane, then
evenly chased behind the top pair through the final furlong. CUZZYWUZZY bumped with an inner foe soon after the start, stalked along the inside early on,
then outside of the clear leader around the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a true kick and only managed to chase evenly. AIZU
tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, but was shuffled back while among foes into the far turn, trailed at the five sixteenths pole, then moved
up inside of foes in midstretch. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) bumped with rivals on both sides in the early stages, laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, the three to four wide turning for home, but failed to menace. HAT TIP settled off three to four wide, attempted to circle foes with a five wide rally
around the far turn, but flattened out in upper stretch without contending. RUNAWAY ROCKETTE tracked from midpack three wide, inched closer four wide
around the far turn, but faded in the five path passing the quarter pole. FREEDOM BOUND stalked two wide, but required rider encouragement to keep
pace three wide and among foes around the far turn, and weakened through the lane.

KOBE B vied for the lead three to two wide and between horses, then drew off passing the quarter pole, and inched away under driving pressure. NOTABLE
EXCEPTION broke a step slowly, trailed into the turn, swung seven wide entering the lane, and stayed on to reach place approaching the wire. HANEY
BOYS prompted the pace along the inside early on before backing off to stalk after a quarter mile, tracked from the pocket around the turn, tipped to the four
path at the three sixteenths pole, gained between horses to gain place entering the final furlong while having many lengths to find on the clear leader, then
chased that rival home before being nailed for place. CAPTAIN FANTASTIC got hung out four wide while off of the pace, was floated to the six path entering
the lane, chased mildly thereafter, but was outkicked for show entering the final sixteenth. DROP ANCHOR tracked three wide and between horses, came
into the lane in the five path and among foes, then failed to menace. EL SEGUNDO pressed four to three wide, vied around the turn, but faltered in upper
stretch. GRAYWING set the pace, showed the way from a pair of vying outer rivals around the turn, then weakened passing the quarter pole. BARSTOW
bumped an outer foe at the start, stalked two wide and between horses, came under urging into the turn, then weakened on his left lead passing the quarter
pole. BEEP BEEP broke a beat slowly and took a bump from an inner foe at the start, took the turn in the three path while far off of the pace, and was
outrun.

Footnotes
CAMP HOPE stalked along the inside, then from the two path behind the leading pair around the far turn, bumped an outer steadfast GREYES CREEK
while searching for racing room passing the quarter pole, committed to a wide rail seam soon after, slipped through and produced bid in upper stretch, led
entering the final furlong, inched clear soon after as a pair of outer foes pursued, met their bids approaching the wire, was surpassed by his outermost
challenger, but regained an advantage via a head-bob at the wire. BEACON HILL rated back in the two to three path around the turns, swung wide entering
the lane, then out to the nine path in upper stretch, rallied while lugging in subtly in midstretch, determinedly pursued the clear leader in the final furlong
along with an inner rival to produce a bid in the closing stages, gained a very narrow advantage late, but missed via a head-bob. T D DANCE broke slowly,
laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, rallied while hanging on his left lead to bid for place entering the
final furlong, changed over approaching the final sixteenth as an outer BEACON HILL surged alongside, pursued the leader along with that foe to bid
between horses in the closing stages, but missed while getting outfinished. PINE KNOLL was hung out three wide while off of the pace, floated to the seven
path in upper stretch, then stayed on mildly after getting outkicked by an outer rival to reach a minor placing at the wire. LIKE THE KING saved ground off of
the pace, took the far turn in the two path before shifting out to the six path in upper stretch, but lacked a kick between horses in midstretch, then got
outfinished for fourth at the wire. STREET READY pressed two wide while in the three path, led turning for home, but met bids on either side in upper
stretch, proved no match for his inner challenger at the furlong grounds, and faltered. GREYES CREEK inconsequentially tossed his head at the start,
tracked two wide, then from the three path around the far turn, came into the lane in the four path, held his ground while taking a bump from an inner foe at
the quarter pole, ranged up between horses to vie in upper stretch, but was outkicked entering the final furlong, then faltered. GLYNN COUNTY tracked
from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but only managed to chase through midstretch before encountering traffic entering
the final sixteenth. ARGENTELLO (IRE) broke slowly and never got involved. INVADER set the pace while a bit off of the rail, but was headed by an outer
rival at the five sixteenths pole, and caved entering the lane.

Footnotes
LAPIS LAZULI bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, tipped four wide entering the lane, grinded away while taking aim on the clear leader
in the final furlong, and reeled that rival in at the wire. FULLY CONNECTED bumped with an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, held sway
through midstretch, but tired in the final furlong, and was caught on the wire. LUNAR ROCKET stalked three wide, ranged up to the leader turning for home,
but only managed to chase through upper stretch as that foe held sway, kept on as an outer LAPIS LAZULI rallied alongside in the final furlong, produced a
bid between horses at the leader tired late, but missed. ART HEIST pressed two wide, chased under urging around the turn, but failed to keep pace with the
leader and an outer foe turning for home, but kept on through the lane to secure a minor share. ISTHMIAN laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the
five path in upper stretch, and stayed on mildly while hanging on his left lead. RIGHT OF RUSH raced far back three wide, got flaoted to the six path in
upper stretch, and failed to menace. KEVALAR never got involved. CONGRATS TO MI broke a step slowly before being firmly taken in hand at the start,
then trailed and failed to factor. BRUCE ON THE LOOSE chased along the inside, but faded around the turn. KENNEDY'S BEAU never got involved.
HEARNS chased from midpack four wide, then faded around the turn.
