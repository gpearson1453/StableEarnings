Footnotes
BELLA PRIMA pressed the pace between horses in the early going, moved up to duel headed into the turn, took over the lead while saving ground from
there and pulled clear in the stretch. SHOW'EM WHO'S BOSS broke out slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders up the backstretch,
offered a mild bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN chased
the leader on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn, and gained ground mildly on the outside in the
stretch while never threatening the top two. KISSIN COUSIN led the field on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground
around the turn and tired in the stretch.

dueled while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened from there. SHASHKA tracked the leader on the inside in the early going,
dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and made no bid. SMOKE AND MIRRORS trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, came

WAR NOVEL was urged to an early lead while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, repelled a bid from the two path while racing
around the far turn, and drew off down the lane, much the best. SUPER REIGN raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the
backstretch, launched a bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole, was denied by the eventual winner, and chased that rival home while drifting
out in late stretch, the best of the rest. TASTY'S BULLSEYE raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the
pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was outkicked in the stretch. MISTER ARANGUIZ saved ground around the first turn,
raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and never threatened. JOHNNY ICE
hopped up and hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, improved position slightly while racing in
the three path around the far turn and flattened out from there.

AUTOMATE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field form the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
dueled while saving ground around the far turn and battled gamely from the rail the length of the stretch, holding a narrow margin to the wire. BUILT THAT
WAY hit the gate leaving it, settled in to chase the leader from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid still in the three path
approaching the five sixteenths pole, dueled between horses down the lane, raced in tight quarters with a furlong to go and continued to race gamely from
there, but could not get by the winner. KATHERN'S JOY bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, angled over to save ground around the first
turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to press the pace around the far turn, and dueled between horses down the stretch, just getting nosed
out for second. LEGIT raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, launched a four wide bid
approaching the quarter pole and dueled gamely on the outside down the lane, narrowly outfinished. BOYS OF QUEENS trailed the field from the two path
through the opening half mile, made a mild improvement of position while racing in the two path around the far turn and offered no bid. VITESSE raced in
the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, saved ground around the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch,
and faded from there while drifting out to the wire.

PINK LILY bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to lead between horses up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the
two path around the turn and drew off down the lane. OUR JESSICA JOAN pressed the pace from the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the
turn from the two and three path, made a mild bid turning from home and could not go with the winner, chasing that rival home. NYX AND CHAOS bumped
with the horse to her outside at the break, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, was blocked nearing the half mile, dropped back while saving
ground from there and continued to tire in the stretch. PER RULING #22177PN FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, PINK LILY WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
