racing near the back, moved up late, but was no factor. PROUDTOWN lacked early speed and was never a factor. ST JOE showed early speed, saved
ground around the turn and dropped back. BIG TIME BANDIT broke slow and trailed throughout.

GRAND PRIORITY raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, dueled down the lane with CARLOS PUNCH and proved the
best late. CARLOS PUNCH vied for the early lead, saved ground, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. LEYTON'S
HIPPIE challenged on the front end, forwardly placed throughout, but proved no match for the top two. RUNNER void of early speed, showed late interest,
but was no factor. SPEEDOFTHESPEED pressed the early pace, racing behind the top two in the early part and faded. SWEET DREAMS BABE lacked
early speed, finished wide and was never close. HOPE FOR CHANGE raced near the back, saved ground and showed little.

THUNK unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the turn on the outside, dueled down the lane and was just up. MONZZA pressed the pace, raced
outside around the turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. MEAN CRUISER void of early speed, made a steady
gain, finished wide and proved no match for the top two. CUSTOM KAT lacked early speed, moved up and finished evenly. HOT LE ROY raced evenly near
the back in the early part, saved ground around the turn, checked, getting in tight quarters, moved up late, but was no factor. STAND AND CHEER raced in
the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. SHAR'S TREASURE raced within striking distance in the beginning, dropped back and was
no threat late. SAILING JETT pressed the early pace and retreated. GOT KRAMER sprinted to the front, drove clear and stopped. A STEWARDS INQUIRY
WAS CALLED INTO THE RUNNING OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

GREEN MONSTER raced within striking distance, came around the turn, racing between rivals, made a bid, took the lead and held off CAVE CREEK, who
had a troubled trip. CAVE CREEK broke slow, moved up on the inside around the turn, steadied, blocked, angled out, rallied stretch, swung to the inside
and finished gamely. BAR TAP lacked early speed, moved up, challenged for the lead, dueled down the lane, was outfinished by the top two, but proved
best of others. ORB'S SOUL raced in the back of the pack, moved up on the outside around the turn and finished evenly. MEMORY MAGIC showed early
speed, faded, finished wide and was outrun. BIND ON EARTH vied for the early advantage and made a steady retreat. OPPS MY BAD dueled on the front
end, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
CITIZENS REWARD stalked the leaders in the early part, came around the turn on the outside, took command, pulled away and won handily.
HAIRTRIGGER HEART raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. GRAND ISLE
SUMMER vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. CUPIE CUTIE broke a step slow, made a wide late gain, but was no
factor. SWIFT N' STORMY raced within contention, weakened and finished evenly. KATIE'S C raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the
outside and weakened. MT HOPY raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was no threat. ALLEN'S JUDY void of early speed and showed little. MISS
CARUSO flashed brief speed and made a steady retreat. RENE'S NEW BOW broke a step slow and was never close.
