Footnotes
HISTORIC HEART (IRE) was well placed mid pack just behind the two front runners, came with a rush after the last fence to gain command mid stretch and
drew clear. PRESENCE OF MIND (IRE) battled with DECISIVE TRIUMPH most of the way, they were dueing it out over the last jump then gave way to the
winner in mid stretch. DECISIVE TRIUMPH was battling for the lead with the second place finisher most of the way when the winner took command mid
stretch and could not hold on to the second spot but hung in there for third. STEP TO THE BAR lagged early, rallied on the final turn, but flattened out from
there. GHOSTLIGHTER was no factor here. THE HAPPY GIANT cut beacon lost rider after third jump walked off.
