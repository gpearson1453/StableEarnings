LIVINGONTULSATIME was position just off the pace then angled out at the five sixteenths pole to take the lead at the three sixteens pole, cleared and just
held on. REMEMBER ME TONY chased the leaders then made a three wide rally into the stretch but closed too late. OKIE UNION sprinted to the lead and
after a half gave way. GOSPEL CARLOTTA trailed early and was never a factor. KAT'S HITMAN race three wide throughout and had no impact.

light urging. LADAWN pressed the pace from the inside then lead briefly at the half pole and gave way grudgingly. SWEET STORMY ELLE pressed the
pace from the three path made a bid on the turn but was no match for the top two. FIERY LUCK broke well had had a five wide trip and gave a late try.
MARION BLUE raced near the back and was not a factor. WHO'S MY GIRL was never a threat. DEVINE CANDY was rushed to contention and stopped in
