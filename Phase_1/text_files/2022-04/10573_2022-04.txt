Footnotes
MUY BIEN CORONA away well, drifted in two paths approaching the eighth pole, stayed under a strong drive throughout in a professional effort. NAVAJA
bumped on hind end at the start, drifted out slightly throughout and small filly finished up willingly under a hand ride. J PERFECT DEAL broke in a path at
the start, steady urged early, proved no match for top two and hand ridden final sixteenth. ROSY CARTEL broke in, drifted in and bumped rival early, rider
was hesitant to set down horse, once straightened, was asked right handed and lugged in late, failed to fully extend. ONE FAMOUS BOOGIE bumped by
outside rival at the start, drifted out half a path and corrected early, steady urged thereafter and finished up evenly. ALFONSO off bit slow, came in and
bumped rival at the start, rival then drifted out and caused ALFONSO to shy away a bit, urged midway and failed to have the kick needed to improve. PYC
SPECIAL DASH away cleanly, bumped by outside rival early, and failed to respond when asked, hand ridden the last third of the race. HOLDONIMCOMING
off three quarter slow and in, lost path, angled to rail, asked and lacked needed response to improve, galloped out with some energy.

ONE SWEET BAR away well, quickly assumed command under hand ride, drifted in three paths midway and won well under a hand ride. MORE THAN
CHANCEY broke in, a tad crooked early, straightened out past the eighth and finished well under steady urging. THE TRAIN STATION brushed with inside
rival at the start, set down early and stayed on well in a game effort. VAL QUERETANO minor bump at the start, leveled quickly and failed to finish well
enough to improve position and was crossed over late. CAPORAL RUNAWAY away cleanly, drifted in early, failed to respond to the hand urging, finished
up one paced while lugging out three lanes late. DECLARE MR PERRY away cleanly and had a wide path, lugged out approaching eighth pole, rider rode
cautiously, horse reacted to something and shifted in late while never being set down. FIRE WALL off slow, lacked path during the first half of race and was
not asked thereafter. KARMAVORE away cleanly, rivals on either side were hard to manage and impeded KARMAVORE approaching the eighth pole, had
to take up sharply and lost all chance.

NAVA CARTEL broke in, led by half length early, steady urged and outkicked by inside rival. JACKIES FAMOUS GIRL shifted in away from rival at the start,
steady urged in a solid try. CHISUM away cleanly, floated in early, steady urged and finished evenly. J EL SOVERANO broke in two paths, failed to fully
level and was outrun. VGK FIRE FLY broke in, pushed in early, rider pulled up slightly to avoid ducking in at the gap, that's when outside rival came in and
caused rider to steady sharply and lose all chance.

Footnotes
IMM BORN TO FLY broke in two paths at the start, asked left handed and drifted out a path in the final sixteenth while clear. KR BIKINI BAR broke out a
path, ran straight under steady right hand urging while being no match for winner. AA CARTEL hesitated and came away slow, bumped both sides at the
start, urged right handed and responded, brushed by inside rival as he got up for third. MAS INTEREST bumped at the start and bumped on hind end early,
hand urged while drifting out and brushing with rival late. J BEST QUEEN ducked in three lanes and bothered rivals at the start, straightened out and lugged
out second half of the race. BEE SIESTA broke out, failed to threaten while under urging throughout. FRIVOLOUS fractious behind the gate, off a bit slow,
slammed by ducking in rival and took up sharply at the start. A REV off slow, and slammed at the start, steadied and not asked after.
