Footnotes
COO BIRD was settled early, advanced three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up in deep stretch to
prove best, driving. BOUND LUCKY vied for the lead between horses, then dueled for command on the inside by the furlong marker and led late but it
proved to be not enough, second best. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE vied for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn, then dueled for command in the
drive before fading late. BODIE broke outwardly and was off a step slowly, then raced in the back on the inside on the turn, swung out five wide for the drive
and had a belated rally. RED MAPLE vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. ULTIMATE ANSWER chased the early pace and was on the inside on
the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
GRANDMAS FAVORITE set a pressured pace while racing two wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn and drew out in the drive to prove much the best,
driving. STEEL WOOL tracked the early pace three wide, then was between rivals leaving the turn, then finished willingly to gain the place award. WILD
RIVER WOLF was off slowly, then raced on the inside on the turn, tipped out two wide leaving the turn for racing room, then got the show award late from
between rivals. GLITTER MOUNTAIN pressed the winner from the inside and weakened in the drive. TOO LEGIT chased the pace and was four wide on
the turn and came up empty in the drive. PUGIN was settled three wide on the turn and swung out five wide for the drive and had no rally.

IBRIM shifted off the inside nearing the half mile marker and stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid leaving the turn and took over leaving the
furlong marker, then maintained a safe margin late to prove best under a mild drive. VICTORY JET was bumped at the start, settled early and saved ground
on the turn, angled out leaving the turn four wide for racing room, closed well but could not get to the winner, second best. WARP RIDE was rated along
early and dropped to the inside on the turn, was boxed by the quarter pole, then was blocked and had to check by the furlong marker, shifted out and was
up for the show award late. FEELTHEBEAT set an unchallenged pace and raced towards the inside on the turn, was headed nearing the furlong marker and
weakened. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA chased the early pace and made a mild bid four wide nearing the quarter pole but was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
GIMBALA stalked the early pace and made a two wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew clear in the stretch to prove best under a
drive. WHERE'S ANTHONY chased the early pace, and was two wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive and finished willingly while getting the
nod for the place award. WAKE UP MAGGIE chased the early pace on the inside and came two wide into the drive, then was outfinished for the place
award while staying on. PLUTONIAN (IRE) was off slowly, then settled early, raced on the inside on the turn and swung out five wide for the drive but had
no kick. ROBUSTO was settled early, then raced three wide on the turn and came six wide into the drive but had no late rally. A I INITIATIVE was bumped
at the start, then taken back and to the inside, then found best stride late while being no threat. DEALMAKER was sent to the front to set the pace on the
inside and faltered the final quarter of a mile.
