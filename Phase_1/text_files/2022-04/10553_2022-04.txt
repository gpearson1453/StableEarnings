Footnotes
DUST DANCER was bumped by ROCKET MAN ATTACK in the opening strides, came in on J J'S SOLUTION near the eleven sixteenths, tracked the
leading pair outside of B G ATTACK down the back straight and in the three path on the turn, was pushed along approaching the three eighths, encroached
four wide on the leading group approaching the quarter, chased the leader to midstretch, kicked on in earnest approaching the sixteenth, took the lead at the
sixteenth and cleared. ROCKET MAN ATTACK broke inward and bumped into DUST DANCER in the opening strides, was sent to the lead, took pressure
from ASTI SKY to his outside into the turn, was engaged by B G ATTACK as well past the five sixteenths, shook to a clear lead in upper stretch, kept on
under a drive, was caught near the sixteenth pole and no match for the winner from there but held safe for the place, unseated his rider on the gallop out,
but was soon apprehended and walked off the course. J J'S SOLUTION was bumped between horses in the opening strides, raced at the rear of a
tightly-knit main pack early, checked between horses at the eleven sixteenths when DUST DANCER came in, trailed in the three to four path around the
turn, was asked near the three eighths, came into the lane three wide, found his best in the final sixteenths and gained late for show. DASTARDLY DEEDS
chased at the inside of the main group early, settled well behind the leading group past the five eighths, raced in second last in the two to three path on the
turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, chased on but ultimately lacked the necessary late kick. B G ATTACK was bumped in the opening strides as a
result of the chain reaction from ROCKET MAN ATTACK breaking inward, tracked the leading pair inside, raced in the two path at the inside of the tracking
flight on the turn, bid between the leading pair near the five sixteenths, loomed between horses into the lane, proved no match past the three sixteenths and
flattened. ASTI SKY tracked the pacesetter down the backstretch, attended the pace two wide on the turn, raced three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
KREWE CHIEF hopped up and broke out leaving the gate, brushing with the horse to his outside in the process, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside
up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole and dueled gamely down the stretch to get up in the final strides. TRY
TRY AGAIN chased the frontrunner between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path while racing around the turn, dueled gamely on the
inside in tight quarters down the lane and just missed. RENEGADE BOB was brushed and forced out by the horse to his inside at the break, settled off the
pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring horses on the
outside from there. HIGH HERO led the field between horses through the opening three eighths of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, swung wide
entering the stretch when MAXIMUS IMAGE forced his way through on the rail, and flattened out in the final furlong. OUR THOMAS raced off the pace on
the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly while never threatening. MAXIMUS IMAGE tracked the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, raced in tight quarters entering the stretch, found room and weakened in the final furlong. THE
RIDER OF THE TRY TRY AGAIN CLAIMED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF KREWE CHIEF, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.
UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

SWEET BLINDNESS settled in the rear flight inside of RARE ACTION ATTACK early, chased at the rear of the main group in the two path on the turn,
rallied inside into the lane, switched outside of FIRST SQUADRON midstretch, sustained his rally, and took the lead between horses in the final fifty yards.
FIRST SQUADRON cleared to the lead inside, saved ground on the turn, continued on a measured lead into the lane, went to a drive near the furlong mark,
led to the final fifty yards but was caught late. GRAND PRIZE chased the leading pair down the backstretch, was pushed along three wide on the turn, was
driven three wide into the lane, chased on willingly but was ultimately outfinished. THAT LUVIN FEELING broke through the gate before the race but was
stopped from running off by an adept assistant starter, passed fit to reload, tracked the leader down the backstretch and two wide on the turn, came into the
lane between horses in the tracking flight, and weakened from midstretch. RARE ACTION ATTACK was pushed along early but settled at the rear, found
himself outpaced in the three path on the turn, and had no response under a drive three wide in the lane.

COMISKEY PARK led the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held off a late
closer to the wire. COCO BRAVADO chased the leader up the backstretch, raced between horses in the three path around the turn, and gained ground in
late stretch, the best of the rest. TWO COOKIE RULE bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced outside up the backstretch, offered a bid
from the four path coming around the turn, and was outkicked while finishing evenly from there. AWESOME FAMILY pressed the pace on the inside through
the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the final furlong. DRAMATIC KITTEN bumped with the horse to his
outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and made no
bid. YALIKEANYTHING trailed the field throughout, raced in the two and three path around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COYOTE ROAD chased three wide down the backstretch, was pushed along into the turn and joined the tracking flight three wide, was driven between
horses in upper stretch and rallied, took the lead approaching the furlong mark and drove clear. PATH TO SUCCESS settled at the rear, raced two wide in
the rear flight into the turn, began to improve four wide when asked near the three eighths, went to a drive in upper stretch, chased on willingly but could not
reel in the winner. JUSTICE ONCE chased between horses down the back straight, settled back to the inside of the rear flight into the turn, went to a drive in
the three path, was taken four wide into upper stretch, and chased on evenly for the show. MR CLINE raced at the inside of the chasing flight down the
backstretch, tracked well off the leader while saving ground inside horses on the turn, was outkicked inside into the lane and flattened out. ALL OVER
OLIVER cleared to the lead, set the pace well ahead of the rest of the field while racing in the two to three path on the turn, went to a drive near the three
sixteenths as his lead was diminishing, was caught by COYOTE ROAD approaching the furlong mark and weakened inside. NO MORE Z U tracked the
leader between horses down the backstretch and around the turn, raced three wide into the lane, shifted slightly further out midstretch and proved empty.

Footnotes
HOT DAME set a pressured pace inside through the clubhouse turn, dueled inside of GOOD MAGNOLIA down the backstretch, continued to dispute terms
inside of that foe and MAYSTART around the far turn and into the lane, and edged clear in the final furlong. MAYSTART tracked the leading pair four wide
through the clubhouse turn, advanced to attend outside the dueling pair down the back straight, joined the battle up front around the far turn and into the
lane, was outfinished by HOT DAME in the final furlong but chased on a clear second best. WILDWOOD MAGGIE settled near the rear, was pushed along
in the two to three path around the far turn, rallied between horses last the three eighths, chased on while continuing to improve position through upper
stretch, and kept on well enough to hold the show despite drifting out. SEAWARD chased midpack inside of foes, tipped out for a three wide rally around the
far turn, swung out six wide into the lane, kept on with interest while drifting out, but was narrowly outkicked for the show. KIMBERLY FRANCES broke
inward and grazed SAMARITA in the opening strides, settled at the rear early, continued patiently toward the rear in the two to three path around the five
turn, swung out five wide into the lane, angled in from midstretch, kept on willingly but missed the show. GOOD MONGOLIA pressed outside of HOT DAME
around the first turn, engaged her in a duel into the backstretch, disputed the pace two wide down the back straight, continued to battle on the pace while
racing between horses around the far turn and into the lane, proved no match for HOT DAME and MAYSTART from the three sixteenths, and weakened.
WAVE OF GOODNESS chased between horses around the first turn, tracked just behind the leading trio down the back straight, was pushed along into the
far turn, began to lose ground on the leaders in the two to three path around the bend, and had no more in the lane. SAMARITA was grazed by KIMBERLY
FRANCES in the opening strides, raced rank three wide between horses through the first turn, chased near the rear two wide down the back straight,
emptied out in the five to six path on the far turn and found nothing further for the drive.

Footnotes
KITTEN ROCKS hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, began
a bid passing the quarter pole, and gained ground outside to pull clear in the final furlong. PERFECT DIVA bumped with the horses to either side at the
break, raced in the middle of the pack between horses early, saved ground around the turn, began an inside bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled in
upper stretch and chased the winner home, the best of the rest. HOOSIER GOLD CASE hit the gate leaving it, settled at the back of the pack on the inside
through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside late. I LOVE
TO RACE raced off the pace on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path, and made a mild improvement of position between
horses in late stretch. ELSIE'S KID bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, dueled inside in upper stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. GODSGIFT trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the
three path around the turn and passed tiring horses late while never threatening. UPSIDE DOWN brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, was
urged to an early lead, opened up while saving ground around the turn, was caught entering the stretch and tired between horses in the final furlong.
SHEZA SAVAGE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and continued to tire from
there.
