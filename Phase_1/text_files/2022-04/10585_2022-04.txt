WINDIGO SPIRIT pressed the early pace from the inside, then took the lead at the half pole to a clear lead and held on in the drive. TOMMY TSUNAMI was
positioned just off the pace on the inside then made a rail rally to just miss. GRAYGHOSTGRANVILLE was forwardly placed in the three path and made his
bid on the turn but faltered. JUST BECAUSEWAY saved ground through the turn then angled out at the head of the stretch to improve position late.
FORTYSLEW sprinted to the early lead then steadily retreated. MAHOMEITE tracked the leaders while racing four wide throughout and was never a factor.
MY SECRETARIAT trailed. FRACTIONAL TIME IS NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. PER THE OKLAHOMA RACING COMMISSION,
TOMMY TSUNAMI HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

QUEENOFTHERAINBOW was within striking distance from the three path made her move in mid turn and wore down the leader in the stretch to hold sway.
DIXIEFIED sprinted to a clear lead to set the early pace but when headed in the drive lacked the late kick needed. RIVER LIBERTY chased the leaders from
the four path then made her bid in mid turn to go between rivals but couldn't gain on top two but was best of the rest. AFLEET OKIE was void of early speed
and raced four wide throughout. FATEFULLY YOURS saved ground to no avail. CHANGED TIMES FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
TAKE ME SERIOUS was forwardly placed while saving ground through the first turn and down the backstretch then waited for room to move on the second
turn and angled out at the head of the stretch and drew off to be much the best. SMOKIN' OKIE was unhurried the early and middle stages then made a rail
rally on the second turn but veered out in mid stretch to have her best strides late. RIVER VENUS set the pace from two wide for three quarters and was
empty in the stretch drive. LIL' JIMMI SUE was void of early speed while being four wide on the first turn then was just off the pace in the two path on the
backstretch, made a three wide bid on the final turn and faltered. WHAT A BABE was allowed to settle going five wide in the first turn, four wide on
backstretch and second turn and was never a factor. GOSPEL GINA pressed the pace from the three path then was through after three quarters. TIMES
