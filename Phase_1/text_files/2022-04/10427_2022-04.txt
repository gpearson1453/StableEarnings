Footnotes
BAYTOWN LOVELY laid off of the pace in the two path, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied with a good kick while having many lengths to find
on the leading pair entering the final furlong, ranged up to them in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage at the wire. SEACHROME stalked in the four
path, bid three wide entering the lane, battled with an inner GILA through upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, changed over before gaining an
advantage at the furlong grounds, led entering the closing stages, but was nailed at the wire by an outer oncharging foe. GILA dueled for the lead inside of a
foe while a bit off of the rail, then inside of a pair of rivals entering the lane when SEACHROME joined the fray, battled with that rival through upper stretch,
but was headed at the furlong grounds, fought on through deep stretch, but was outkicked for place late. JULIA'S CHARDONNAY was brushed by an inner
foe into an outer rival, bobbled due to the incident, then chased the leading pair from the two to three path, shifted out to the five path while failing to keep
pace in upper stretch, then was outkicked while surpassing an inner tiring rival at the furlong grounds. ONE STORMY LADY brushed with an inner foe at the
start, and was outrun. STARSTRIKER (GB) was last away while, rushed up to press along the inside early on, was rated back approaching the turn to stalk,
chased the leaders entering the lane, but failed to change leads while fading thereafter. SPECIAL BOND came out and brushed an outer foe at the start,
dueled for the lead two wide, then weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
STELLAR GRACE laid off of the pace in the four path, gained in the three path behind the leaders around the turn, tipped outside of the leading trio passing
the quarter pole, rallied to bid outside of them entering the final sixteenth, and drew clear. FOUR DAWN vied for the lead two wide and between horses, got
headed while inside of a pair of foes turning for home, battled on through upper stretch to regain an advantage at the furlong grounds, but was bested by an
outer foe entering the final sixteenth, and held place. SMILE AT THE STORM pressed four wide, bid outside of the leading pair turning for home, but briefly
failed to keep pace in upper stretch, chased those rivals into the final furlong before being outkicked entering the final sixteenth, and kept on. SUPER
WONDER GIRL broke slowly, gained four wide around the turn from far off of the pace, then chased the rallying eventual winner through the final furlong,
and missed reaching show. LATTE DOLCE bumped with an inner foe at the start, vied three wide, then from between a pair of rivals turning for home,
continued to contest the lead through midstretch, but yielded entering the final sixteenth. KAIYAS SONG bumped with an outer rival before being taken in
hand between horses soon after the start, trailed around the turn, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and moved up. BODE BY YOU laid back two
wide and between horses, but was shuffled back behind tiring foes around the turn, shifted out to the six path entering the lane, and improved. GEM KEY
raced off of the pace three wide and between horses, shifted out to the five path turning for home, but checked in between horses entering the lane.
GRAVITRON tracked the top flight while tucking down to the three path into the turn, came under a drive while shifting to the two path at the three furlong
pole, and tired through the lane. FLORIS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. PAPPYSAYSYES set the pace inside of a pair of rivals, but
weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. ECLIPSED chased along the inside, and faded around the turn.

DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked the top pair along the inside early on, ranged up in hand into the far turn while tipping
outside of those rivals, bid three wide at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, cleared in upper stretch, and held sway from a rallying outer rival late.
MISS YEARWOOD laid off of the pace two to three wide, gained on the leading trio in the three path around the far turn, tipped to the four path in upper
stretch as DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE took charge, rallied to take aim on that foe in the final furlong, but was only second best. TAKE A STAND pressed two
wide, vied between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering the lane, and gave way. AL QAHIRA set the pace, vied inside of a
pair of foes turning for home, and weakened approaching the quarter pole. PRIMA BALLERINA settled far back along the inside, then took the far turn in the
three to four path, and moved up. BUTTERBEAN tracked four wide, retreated back entering the backstretch, then saved ground around the far turn, and
failed to menace. DUNVEGAN DOLL bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed around both turns, swung to the six path entering the lane, and improved.
MULLING bumped with an outer rival at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MISSED OPPORTUNITY stalked three wide, but came
under a drive into the far turn, and faded around that bend. QUALITY bumped with an inner foe at the start, and never got involved. M M M MY SHAROANA
raced in midpack five wide, but required coaxing approaching the five furlong pole, weakened in the three path into the far turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
DREAM SHAKE tracked two to three wide, split foes through a very narrow seam between horses passing the quarter pole, ranged up to a leading BAG
BOSS at the furlong grounds, and edged ahead through the late stages. BAGBOSS stalked in the two path, smoothly split the leaders when the seas parted
entering the lane, bid in hand at the quarter pole, gained an advantage soon after, dug in at the furlong grounds as rivals on either side produced bids, but
was bested by an outer foe in the late stages. MILLIKEN tracked along the inside, moved to the two path entering the lane to surpass the early pace-setter
in upper stretch after BAGBOSS made first turn, sustained a rail charge to attempt a bid in the final furlong, but lost action when he jumped to avoid a break
in the inner railing's shadow at the sixteenth pole, and flattened out. RUN RUN RAPIDASH stalked outside of the leading trio from the five path, got floated
to the six path entering the lane, then chased inner bidding rivals thereafter and failed to bid. TEQUILAS RANGER raced at the rear in the three path,
shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and moved up. OUTLIER prompted the pace three wide from the four path, vied at the five sixteenths pole before
being floated to the five path approaching the lane, then weakened between horses passing the quarter pole. HANDCARVED set the pace inside of a pair of
prompting foes, and faltered in upper stretch. UBER KIRK prompted the pace two wide and between horses while staying a path away from his inner
counterpart, vied at the five sixteenths pole before drifting outwardly to the four path entering the lane, then weakened passing the quarter pole. WELLMAN
was outrun.

BIZZEE CHANNEL stalked the clear leader from the two path, took aim turning for home, bid in upper stretch while shifting ground outwardly as MR
DUMAS pursued, straightened when the rider switched to right handed urging, resisted the aforementioned menacing rival's bid at the furlong grounds, and
tenaciously fended off that foe under a stiff drive. MR DUMAS tracked in the two to three path, ranged up turning for home, took aim on a leading BIZZEE
CHANNEL in upper stretch while being herded a bit outwardly, grinded away to bid leaving the furlong grounds, sparred through the late stages while not
quite able to reach even terms, and was denied. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME tracked along the inside, chased the top trio from the four path around the far turn,
sustained his pursuit through midstretch to bid for show at the furlong grounds, gained that position soon after while flopping back to his left lead, and held
show from an inner foe late. HIGHEST HONORS saved ground off of the pace, shifted to the two path turning for home, then stayed on between horses
after shifting to the three path in midstretch, bid for show inside of MIDNIGHT TEA TIME in the late stages, but was kept at bay. SOLE VOLANTE rated far
back two to three wide, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on. EONS settled at the rear two wide, swung to the eight path in upper
stretch, but failed to threaten between horses. MONARCHS GLEN (GB) leaned outwardly and bumped an outer foe at the start, trailed along the inside,
angled to the nine path entering the lane, but failed to menace. HAWKISH tracked in midpack two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, but
lacked the needed kick to produce a bid. MUTAKATIF (IRE) laid off of the pace three wide, but failed to factor. MEGACITY took a bump from an inner foe at
the start, cleared off into the first turn, met the winner's bid in upper stretch, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. TIESTO bumped with
an inner foe at the start, saved ground in midpack, and faded entering the lane. GUNNISON bumped with an outer rival aa the start, and was outrun along
the inside.
