Footnotes
MARITAL BLISS chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide in mid-turn, cleared into the lane when roused then was hand urged to
the end while lead diminished. MIDWAY MIRACLE was unhurried while off the inside, moved through the three path in the far turn, asked in late turn then
gained through the lane to the end. FAST ICE was near the rail through the far turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up for the minor share
while not a threat. OFFUTT COLE chased the pace from the two path into the turn, bid with the winner two wide through mid-turn, continued to chase the
top one into the lane then flattened out. BRIGHT SPARK was never a factor while racing near the rail far back. HALOO set the pace while near the inside
into the far turn then gave way nearing the five-sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
CAP DE FUEGO vied for the lead two wide through the turn, was challenged on the outside in late turn, dueled with that one to inside the eighth pole, shook
off that challenge, cleared then was kept to the task to the end. FOREVER A CHAMP raced along the inside through the turn when never far back, came off
the rail into the lane, bullied through between rivals near the sixteenth pole and finished with good energy while running out of real estate. G AS IN
GEORGE was in the three path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path, had aim on the dueling leaders with an eighth to
go then hung. TUFFER THAN TUFF settled off the pace while in the three path, bid quickly three wide in late turn, dueled for the lead through the lane then
faltered nearing the sixteenth pole. CLEARING WAIVERS was never a factor while in the two path through the turn. SACRED SKY vied for the lead along
the inside through late turn then faded after entering the lane. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG was never a menace while saving ground.

DESTINY'S DARLING was unhurried while off the inside and in the three path, angled into the five path entering the lane, continued with good momentum
after straightening, caught the leader near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. DULCIMER DAME saved ground through the turn when never far back, came
off the rail and into the two path to bid for the lead, was inching past the leader approaching the sixteenth pole when caught by the winner then kept on to be
clear for the place spot. BETCHA raced behind a wall of rivals through the turn, was beaten to the five path in upper lane, continued behind after
straightening, shifted clear nearing the sixteenth pole then finished with good energy. ONLY REWARD'S saved ground through the turn, cut the corner into
the lane, gained then lead soon after, maintained a short advantage with a furlong to go then faltered late. MARYS LAST SONG was four wide through the
turn when not far back, continued in the six path into the lane and never menaced thereafter. SHAPE OF YOU pressed the pace three wide through late
turn, loomed with aim on the top one into the lane then was empty late. BAILESTON LASSIE set the pace from the two path through the turn, came under
pressure in late turn then gave way through the lane. SENTIMENTALJOURNEY trailed throughout while in the three path.

the latter stages while widening. CLIMBER vied for the lead along the inside through the turn and into the lane, yielded to the top one inside the eighth pole
then kept on well to finish well clear for the place spot. LAST HURRAH vied for the lead three wide through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five
path then weakened the final eighth. IDAREYOUTODANCE raced in the four path through the turn while chasing the three rival duel, came into the lane
from the five path and never threatened. LIZZSAIDNO raced in the two or three path through the turn, came three wide into the lane and never factored.
SURLEY in the two path through the turn and tired. FARM SAFETY was never a menace while along the inside. SWIFT RITHMS was outrun while in the

Footnotes
ONE FOR RICHIE gained a quick lead, cleared well before the first call, continued on a clear advantage through the turn and into the lane, widened when
straightening then was kept to the task to the end. LT. JUNIOR GRADE was along the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the two path and was
slowly gaining to the end. TALE OF FAME raced in the three path through the turn, was asked in late turn while swinging into the lane from the seven path
then moved up to gain the minor share while not a threat to the top two. WAR ACT raced in the three path through mid-turn, was roused nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, continued in the three path in the lane, could not gain on the top ones then lost the show spot late. GAME BOY BENNY was bothered
at the start, raced along the inside into the lane and never was a serious threat. APACHE saved ground through the turn and moved up while not a menace.
PETIT VERDOT in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and lacked a response. NAUGHTY ALFRED never a factor while in
the five to the four path. PITAMAN chased the pace from the two path into the lane then faded.

LADY VANIER clear on the lead through the turn, was joined by the runner-up outside the eighth pole, dueled with that one through the final eighth and just
prevailed. Z ZS RED chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane, got on near even terms with the winner near the eighth pole,
dueled with that one through the final furlong and could not get past. TRAFALGAR SHORE saved ground through the turn and into the lane and offered a
mild gain to be clear for the minor share. HABUIAH raced in the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and was even.
CATCHAFALLNSTAR trailed while near the inside through the turn, came off the inside into the lane and offered belated interest. MOLLY'S WARRIOR was
in the three path through the turn and lacked a response. HAPPYKIYAY chased the pace from the two to the four path through late turn then faded after
turning into the lane. FASHION DIVA raced in the five to the four path through the turn and never was a factor. NEVER TO MANY HUGS raced between
rivals leaving the backstretch, was taken up while in tight and dropped back. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

SPIN THAT TUNE vied for the lead from the two path into the turn, continued on near even terms with the runner-up into the lane, shook clear when
straightening in the lane after roused then geared down late while well clear. FIRST KITTEN vied for the lead from the three path through the turn, continued
close up into the lane, could not keep up with the winner through the final eighth and settled for second best. GABERDINE was in the two path through the
turn while well back of the top two then came along for the minor share. TAKE CHARGE CHLOE walked out of gate and spotted field about six lengths,
raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane and showed interest to the wire. WICKED KITTY never a factor while along the inside. LET'S DUET
moved up through the land while well back. EASYONMYEYES raced in the three path through the turn and tired while never a serious contender. GET
STORM AWAY was outrun from off the rail. ROCK OUT chased the two rival duel into the turn, dropped back approaching the five-sixteenths pole, was

Footnotes
SIXTYTHREECALIBER gained the lead nearing the half mile pole, maintained a short advantage through the turn and into the lane, was joined on both
sides by rivals approaching the eighth pole, dueled between while exchanging brushes with the show rival inside the eighth pole, continued to duel to the
wire and prevailed while stepping in a half path late. FORGOTTEN REALM raced near the rail through the far turn when just behind the top ones, got
through near the quarter pole, moved to duel for the lead with two others after straightening in the lane and racing very near the rail, continued on near even
terms with the winner into deep stretch, was brushed very late and denied. BEACH KITTEN unhurried early while off the inside, bid quickly four wide
through late turn, continued with momentum into the lane, gained a short lead with an eighth to go then could not sustain the effort the final sixteenth. NILE
RIVER QUEEN was unhurried early while trailing into the backstretch, bid in late turn and into the lane from the three path then could not close in on the top
three late. VERKLIMT was in the three path through the turn and weakened. MEGAN'S NOEL never was a factor while in the four path through the far turn.
DIAMONDS N DENIM vied for the lead into the far turn, dropped back and was done in mid-turn. KEEN ICE SIGHT chased the pace then vied for the lead
through the far turn while in the three path then was suddenly done after entering the lane. WINTER LOVE was hustled through the first turn to gain the
lead, continued to lead down the backstretch, was done approaching the half-mile pole and finished far back.

Footnotes
STORMY'S HERO broke alertly and gained the lead at once, maintained a clear lead through the turn, continued to be clear well inside the sixteenth pole,
shortened late and lasted. TALKTOMEJUSTICE chased the clear leader through the turn and into the lane, continued to be kept to task late and was
suddenly closing in on her stablemate. MISSY LIZZY was in the two path through the turn and into the lane then finished evenly. WICKED JUSTICE raced
in the two or three path through the turn and into the lane and turned in an even effort. I MATTER in the two or three path through the turn, came into the
lane from the four or five path and offered a mild gain while not a threat. WAY BALI never a factor while racing near the inside into the lane. LUSH BE A
LADY never menaced while along the rail. TIME TO CONFESS chased the winner along the inside through the turn then was empty approaching the eighth
pole.
