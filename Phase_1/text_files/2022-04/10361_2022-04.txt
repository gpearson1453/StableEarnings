Footnotes
AFLEET SNIPER rated in behind the leaders, tipped out early on the turn and was given more rein past the three-eighths beginning to pick it up traveling
outside three to four wide, struck the lead at the top of the stretch and was shaken up, drove clear and held safe. GRAND ROYALE broke just a half-step
slowly and was given mild encouragement to track in behind the leaders while shifting in, sat in behind the pacesetter along the rail on the turn, lacked room
and had to tape on the brakes past the quarter pole, angled out five wide after that but was left with too much to do and was second best. YESTERYEAR
stalked the early pacesetter, took closer order entering the turn to press two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR moved to the
fore soon after the start to dictate terms racing several paths off the rail, shifted in entering the turn, weakened in the stretch. KWIK broke a half-step slowly,
switched outside a rival heading up the backstretch, moved out further past the five-sixteenths to be five wide past the quarter pole, failed to rally. DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
OSIYO was coaxed forward after the start to set the pace facing pressure from an outside rival while racing off the inside, continued this way in the two to
three path through the first turn, up the backstretch and into the far turn, was shaken up at the top of the stretch and kicked clear. BACKSTAGE BUD
pressed outside the aforementioned three to four wide, offered no late kick but was second best. SOME DUDE exchanged light contact into the first turn
racing between runners, continued two to three deep on that bend, raced in behind rivals heading up the backstretch, lacked room and altered outside a foe
at the half, moved out further from three to five wide on the far turn, finished up evenly to capture show honors. SINNER REJOICE exchanged a light bump
at the seven-eighths while three wide entering the first turn, raced two to three deep throughout and kept on evenly. WILD RUMBLE was lightly brushed at
the start, settled into stride at the rear racing outside, went four wide on the first turn, continued in that path on the far turn before angling out at the
three-sixteenths, failed to rally. CONTINENTAL COWBOY broke sharply but was outpaced to the first turn despite some encouragement, shifted in to save
ground tracking inside, steadily retreated. STEELY CAPER broke outwardly brushing a rival, stalked the leading pair four to five wide, turned up empty.
HERE'S YOUR DRINK raced inside, tired.

Footnotes
PLENTY OF VISION stalked the pacesetter from outside three wide through the first turn, ranged up alongside on the far turn going three then four wide on
that bend, took over a narrow lead at the three-sixteenths, was put to a drive and edged clear by mid-stretch then held under steady handling. SMOKIN'
OKIE settled off the leaders two wide on the first turn, advanced inside on the far turn gradually moving out later on that bend, angled further still to be five
wide turning for home and put to an all-out drive at this juncture, gained steadily but was too little too late. GOSPEL GINA got away alertly, set the pace
inside, moved off the fence and saw the lead shrink while racing in the two then three path on the far turn, weakened in the stretch. SMOKEY REFLECTION
was unhurried early and shifted in, saved ground on both turns and ran on evenly. VALENTINA LIL was in just a bit tight two wide into the first turn then
moved out a path, was within range four wide on the far turn but flattened out. I'M A STEPHANIE went three to four wide on the first turn and moved forward
in pursuit of the leaders leaving that bend, steadily dropped back five wide thereafter and came up empty. WHAT A BABE raced outside four to five wide
around the first turn, went six deep on the far turn, dropped back and faded.

DECEMBER SEVEN broke on top and dictated terms on the front end racing off the rail, continued mostly in the two to three path, was challenged by an
outside rival late on the far turn, edged away and then held that rival at bay while being kept to the task. GOT MOJO stalked the pace three to four wide,
edged closer to be in contention but could not overtake the leader while keeping on well to be clearly second best. JOHN ALLEN pressed inside, steadily
weakened. THAT'S WHAT I SAY was far back early content to trail, moved out four wide late on the far turn and improved position. MIDNIGHT REVOLT
failed to threaten after racing four to five wide on the turns. ALWAYS A CATCH was caught four to five wide on the first turn, shifted in heading nearing the
three-quarter pole, saved some ground on the far turn but dropped back and tired. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. PER RULING FROM THE OKLAHOMA
RACING COMMISSION, DECEMBER SEVEN HAS BEEN DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MY FORTUNATE SON settled inside just off the rail, moved out on the turn to be five wide coming into upper stretch, struck the lead just outside the furlong
marker and drove clear. EL VALE exchanged a bump after the start, stalked from outside, edged closer to contend four wide on the turn, took a narrow lead
near the quarter pole, began to edge away in upper stretch but was soon overtaken and no match for the winner. MAGIC CARPET settled off the leaders,
went four wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch, got up for show honors while no threat to the top ones. CAJUNS GOLDEN POND was prominent
early vying for the lead inside, switched outside a rival about three wide coming past the quarter pole, failed to rally. A FLICKER OFSILVER exchanged
bumps with inside and outside rivals just after the start, vied between runners then dueled inside a rival but off the fence in about the two path through the
turn, weakened in the stretch. BEST YEAR YET exchanged contact after the break, lacked early speed despite some encouragement, moved near the
inside heading into the turn and failed to threaten. ONE SILVER DOLLAR raced off the inside in the four path through the turn, tired. DUE TO TIMER
ISSUE, FIVE-FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE.

MARIA ELENA Y. G dueled inside a rival, lost some ground on that one on the turn but regained control in upper stretch and edged clear while being kept to
the task. DIXIEFIED dueled outside the winner going two to three wide on the turn, was no match for that one but saved the place. RIVER LIBERTY settled
off the leaders inside on or just off the rail, began to move out late on the turn angling five wide into upper stretch, gained mildly but steadily and missed
second. SIGICRICKET reared at the start spotting the field about three to four lengths, was guided outside and advanced past rivals to pursue the leading
pair, went three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. AFLEET OKIE settled off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn swinging six
deep into upper stretch, failed to rally.

TWICE THE PRICE settled well back of the leaders, moved out from three to five wide on the turn beginning to pick it up, came out a further path turning for
home, was carried out in mid-stretch, took aim and drove past late. CITY OF HOPE was forwardly-placed inside to contest the pace, edged clear on the
turn, drifted into the stretch and then further while in the stretch, was no match for the winner but held the place. MONET'S DEVIL chased the leaders
mid-pack, went three to four wide on the turn dropping back, belatedly made a run while shifting in a bit near the sixteenth pole and missed second. I CAN'T
TELL YA was forwardly-placed outside, chased four wide through the turn, moved out a bit in the stretch and had no extra. PRINCE OF EARL steadied
when in tight between rivals in the early going, trailed to the turn, went five wide on that bend moving out further for the stretch run, gained mildly. GOD
HELP US was forwardly-placed between runners early then chased three wide through the turn, weakened thereafter. GOSPEL TRUTH showed brief speed
between runners early, dropped back and moved nearer the rail saving ground on the turn, had no late bid.

ROZEY CHEEKS was somewhat coaxed from the break to make the lead, shifted in entering the first turn to dictate terms in the two path, faced pressure up
the backstretch, regained control entering the far turn racing inside, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out in mid- to late-stretch but held. CANADA
CANDY tracked the pace two wide, shifted out about the five-eighths, went three wide into the second turn, moved out five wide into upper stretch, took aim
but despite solid urging could make no headway. DO YOU BILEVE raced outside four wide early, moved forward to prompt the pace taking a narrow lead
about the five-eighths till the seven-sixteenths, continued to press two wide from outside on the far turn, was outkicked in the stretch. SEEING DOUBLE
raced off the leaders two to three wide on the first turn, took closer order two deep on the far turn, came out in the stretch and ran on evenly. NORA'S
LEGACY stumbled outwardly after the break, saved ground but was not a threat. BRODIE BABY was up close three wide early, continued the pursuit four to
five wide on the far turn, was empty in the stretch. BIRDIE CURDY failed to threaten racing three to six wide throughout.

Footnotes
MY REAL DIAMOND stalked the early pace, ranged up outside entering the turn going four wide on that bend, was in command at the top of the stretch and
kicked clear. TRUE GLORY exchanged a bump shortly after the start, steadily advanced on the leaders heading to the turn, went five wide on that bend,
loomed a threat turning for home but was no match for the winner. DEVIL EYED DEXTER contested the early pace, went three wide on the turn, was
overtaken in upper stretch and offered no late kick. CHARING CROSS had brief speed among the leaders but soon dropped back being outpaced, went
three to four wide on the turn and secured a minor award in the stretch. ACTING WIZARD lacked room in behind rivals up the backstretch, went five wide on
the turn and in the clear, improved position. BEAR DEN was mid-pack two to three wide through the turn and ran on evenly. SMOOTH OPERATOR
exchanged a bump just after the break, went two to three wide on the turn and passed tired rivals. KOBE BEAN tracked mid-pack inside, altered out in
upper stretch then back in to avoid a tiring rival. LEDOUX WHAT IT DO contended inside, dropped back and faded. RAINBOWS TREASURE failed to
threaten after saving ground on the turn. JEANO went five wide on the turn and was not a factor. FIVE-FURLONG FRACTIONAL TIME UNAVAILABLE.
