Footnotes
ITSALLINTHENOTES in the second flight while in three path into the lane, moved to the fore at will while three wide midway on the turn, clear into the lane,
kept to task the final furlong. HOPTOWN HONEY settled off the pace toward the inside, steered out to be four wide around the tiring early leaders exiting
the turn, roused, finished willingly to be up late for the place. HONEY PARADE in the second group while racing outside, four wide bid outside her entrymate
late in the bend, could not match that one in the drive, caught late for the place. MARY ALICE back off the leaders early well wide, raced four out to five
wide into the lane, went one paced to the wire in lacking a late kick. TAILORBESWIFT off a step slow, trailed early, came five wide out of the turn, improved
position while not a serious threat. HIT IT TWICE remained back in failing to threaten. MO MONEYHONEY alternated up front closest to the inside, gave
way in the drive. COURTLY dueled up front off the inside, stopped.

GREELEY AND BEN broke with the field, within striking distance while saving ground, continued inside into the stretch, roused for the drive, challenged a
furlong out, edged clear under steady handling. MUCH BETTER set the pace while in the two path, vied between horses in upper stretch, could not match
strides with the winner late, proved game for part of the place. ABSOLUTE CHAOS prompted the pace outside, three wide bid late in the turn, could not
match the winner late, determined for part of the place. UPSTRIKER fell well back off the pace soon after the start, lacked a closing response. LIGHTNING
STRUCK last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SHE'S HAMAZING broke back, lacked early foot, moved out and circled several rivals while four wide into the lane, collared the leader past the furlong
marker and drew well clear under pressure. K J'S PISTOL ANNIE forwardly placed while outside, took over three wide turning for home, clear in upper
stretch, proved no match for the winner, remained clear for the place. FIBRILLATOR broke out and slowly, raced well back early, swung out five wide exiting
the turn, finished willingly to annex the show while too late for the top two. NAVAGATIONALBEACON prompted the pace up the backstretch, brief bid
between foes early in the turn, weakened through the stretch. TALLANDLONG broke sharp, set the pace along the inside for a half, faltered when headed
by the runner up entering the stretch. MILU ROCKET hesitated at the break, raced well back early, in the two path into the lane, dropped to the rail and
improved position. MISS DUTTON void of speed, outside the winner up the backstretch, in the two path through most of the turn, passed tiring rivals to
improve position. JERI DAWN off the pace while toward the inside, continued to save ground turn, made little impact in the two path through the stretch.
LORI'S EYES behind the first flight inside, two path exiting the bend, had little left for the stretch run. CADILLAC LADY in the second flight, three wide
through the turn, failed to muster a response. SHAMEFUL PRINCESS balked at loading, raced in mid pack while four wide, also lacked a rally when called
on. STREET RIDE in the main body for a half, backed up through the stretch.

between horses turning into the lane, flattened out in the late going but managed to save the show. ALEX'S STRIKE void of speed outside, raced four wide
through the turn, displayed some belated interest to improve position down the stretch. CAPTURE THE GLORY vied up front while closest to the inside, fell
back inside, continued to weaken through the lane. LOVER BOY prompted the pace from the outside, faltered after a half. TAPPIN FORA DANCE settled
off the pace toward the inside, came three wide into the stretch. LEO DEL REO slight bump break, off the pace, fell back while three wide through the turn,

Footnotes
CAPTAIN DON behind the leader up the backstretch along the inside, angled out to be four wide into the stretch, challenged and took over just inside the
furlong grounds, drew clear under firm handling. MARVIN moved up to contest the issue soon after the start, dueled into the lane closest to the inside,
proved no match for the winner late, game for the place. ESPIONAGE also with the pace from the start, dueled outside the runner up into the lane,
outkicked for the place spot while holding the show. VIOLENT GIGI void of early foot, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, split foes into the lane,
shifted out a bit nearing the furlong marker, improved position. O DOGG lacked early foot well wide, four path through the turn, lacked the needed closing
punch. CHARLIECANDO fell back to trail after the start, three wide through the turn, improved position with some belated interest. INCORRUPTIBLE in mid
pack just off the inside, continued one pace through the lane in lacking a late kick. SPEAK UNITY void of speed, trailed well back midstretch, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. FIVE DREAMS in mid pack for a half, had little for the drive. WIPE THE SLATE with the pace for
three furlongs between horses, gave way. SPECIAL PRYCE in the second flight early, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
REDEFINITION with the pace from the start, shook clear into the turn, drew off through the lane under token pressure to win ridden out. KAYLA behind the
winner off the inside, continued to chase through the turn and into the stretch, could do little with that rival in the run to the wire, game to narrowly garner the
place. ROMANTIC COMEDY off the early pace while racing well wide, four path through the turn, long duel for the place, outfinished. SWEET BEAUTY last
away, lacked speed just off the inside, remained in the two path through the turn, split foes into the lane, improved slightly without posing a serious threat.
EMITYAAZ broke back, continued to trail in the run up the backstretch and into the turn, swung five wide into the lane, passed tiring rivals while also never
dangerous. JOG remained back in lacking a rally. MIDDIE failed to rally after a three wide trip. MONET chased the winner early, beat a steady retreat before
a half.

Footnotes
BOW BOW GIRL outrun early off the inside, closer into the far turn, knifed through in the two path turning for home, vigorous handling, drifted, proved best.
LET'S CRUISE took over soon after the start, set the pace toward the inside, continued to show the way past the furlong marker while off the inside, proved
stubborn to the end. BOBBIN TAIL within striking distance off the inside, three wide through the final turn, remained prominent past the furlong marker,
lacked a winning punch. BLESSED AGAIN closest to the leader for five furlongs, bid second turn, faltered in the drive. SUNNY ISLE BEACH last away,
trailed early, in the two path through the final turn, displayed a modest amount of late interest to improve modestly. MELTING SNOW within striking distance
along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, had little left for the drive. BEACH FLOWER remained back three wide. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME was
finished early while four wide.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW CHARLIE closed from the start off the inside, crept closer and challenged in the three path late in the turn, kicked clear through the lane under
steady handling. LIFE OF SATURDAYS behind the pace just off the inside, steered out when being asked for run in upper stretch, closed with good resolve
to be in time for the place, no real threat to the winner. FLIRTATIOUS SMILE void of early foot, in some traffic when beginning to advance late in the turn,
two path for the drive, improved to be along for the show. WICKED STREET pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, two path through the turn,
came up empty for the drive. OLIVIAN broke sharp, set the pace for a half along the inside, weakened when headed by the winner entering the stretch.
VERY SPICY broke back, lacked speed, steered out sharply in traffic late in the turn to be four wide turning for home, improved position while not a serious
threat. MISS RITA in mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, lacked rally. GUEST IN MY HEART off slowly, raced back and outside, four wide
into the turn, fanned six wide exiting, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. EPWORTH within striking striking distance while four wide, tired
through the lane. FAST SOPHIA broke back, three out to five wide wide through the turn, lacked closing kick. MAZIE G in mid pack and three wide for a
half, backed up through the stretch.
