BIRTHDAY PARTY pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, drove clear down the home stretch and was kept to the task. TIN DELAY lacked early
speed, moved up fast down the backside, challenged to the wire, couldn't match strides late, but held on for place. LAST TO KNOW raced near the back in
the beginning, gained ground on the outside around the final turn, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. HE'S A LUCKY MAN raced within
contention, eased back, improved position late, but was no factor. THE BIG IRISHMAN void of early speed and showed little. RANGE OF MOTION went to
the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. COCO'S MAN raced near the back, raced wide around the first turn, pulled up down the backside and was
vanned off.

GOLDEN PASSAGE vied for the early lead, drove clear and won under steady urging. LEROY JENKINS raced within striking distance, moved up on the
outside around the turn, made a bid, couldn't catch the winner, but was a clear second. CHIEF CHARLIE raced within contention, made a bid, hung down
the stretch, lacking a late kick. SY MICHAEL pressed the pace, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and missed show. PLEASANT VISION was
an early factor, faded and was no threat late. DRAFT CHOICE raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was outrun. SPIN TOWN stumbled badly at
the start and was never close. SEEHOSS dueled on the front end, saved ground and dropped back.

the win. FIRST I'VE SEEN was an early factor, eased off the front end, saved ground and came back willingly. IRONIT void of early speed, came around the
turn wide, made a bid, but proved no match late for the top two. MACEE raced evenly near the back, finished wide and was no threat. WON DAY raced
within striking distance and faded. LAKE MARIE dueled on the front end in the beginning, saved ground and was finished early.

Footnotes
PARALISSFRMANALYSS raced within contention in the early going, came around the turn on the outside, pulled away and won handily. CYBER GUN
bobbled start, void of early speed, made a late gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. PALIMONIUM dueled on the front end, forwardly
placed throughout and was caught late for second. THE KUKRI vied for the early lead, raced close throughout and weakened late. CHAPEL OF DREAMS
raced in the middle of the field, made a bid and faded. I'M A FLASHY KID lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. MY LITTLE JUNIOR
flashed early speed, saved ground and faded. HESACALENDARBOY raced near the middle of the pack, put forth an even effort and lacked a bid. TENPINS
TERRITORY always raced near the back and was outrun. RIVER'S RAGING was an early factor and made a steady retreat. BARNEY'S PASSION lacked
early speed and was never close.
