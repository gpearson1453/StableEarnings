Footnotes
SONORA SERMON settled off of the early pace, was roused four wide on the turn, was put to firm encouragement through the lane and responded in the
final sixteenth to prevail. CHUMLY broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions through the turn, was confronted nearing the quarter
marker, shook clear in upper stretch but was tagged in the final strides by the winner and bested the rest. FLOYD KNOWLES was hustled leaving the break,
stalked the pace two wide through the turn and advanced nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and was outfinished in the end, while
holding for third. STARRY SIERRA lacked speed through the turn and rallied in the final furlong to challenge for the show. FULL OF LIFE tracked the early
pace, advanced on the turn three wide, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the final stages. KEEP ON DANZING bobbled at the start and was off
slowly, chased the pace from an inside position through the turn and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
QUANTUM QUEST broke alertly and took command of the early pace while in hand, set fast fractions while extending the lead through the turn, shifted to
the left lead in the final sixteenth but was well clear in the end. STRUT TO THE WIRE bobbled at the start but recovered well to track the early pace, could
not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and was outkicked in the late stages, while holding for second over an oncoming rival. SATANTA was a bit
slow in the early stages while never far back, maintained a two wide path on the turn, floated out COUNTING CARDS leaving the turn, closed well in the
final stages and just missed for second while clear for third. FURY KAP was hustled leaving the break, chased the pace from the inside through the turn and
gave way in the drive. COUNTING CARDS chased the quick fractions to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker while three wide, was floated out a
path leaving the turn and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
TRIP TO SPAIN chased the quick early pace from an inside path, improved position on the turn while mounting a three wide bid into the stretch, came within
aim leaving the furlong marker, confronted and overtook FRANKLIN ONE STAR leaving the sixteenth marker and had a good late kick to prevail.
FRANKLIN ONE STAR was away alertly, ceded the early lead to FASCINATED, moved up two wide on the turn to duel with that foe nearing the quarter
marker, took command into the drive, was confronted and overtaken by the winner in the final sixteenth but was clear of the rest for second. ARTEMUS
GORDON chased the fast early pace, was coaxed along the turn to be three then four wide at the head of the lane, was outkicked by the top pair but closed
in the end to secure third. FASCINATED was off a step slowly, was hustled to the early lead, dueled for pace duties with FRANKLIN ONE STAR through the
turn, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
DIAMOND WILLOW tracked the pace three wide through the turn, was roused into the stretch run to confront HAKUNUI, battled with that foe, wore him
down in the final sixteenth and drew clear in the end. HAKUNUI was away alertly, conceded the early lead to WHISPER AND WINK and pressed that foe
through the turn, took command leaving the bend, was headed by DIAMOND WILLOW, battled with that foe through the lane, the rider lost his crop leaving
the sixteenth marker, and was bested in the end, while well clear of the rest. DANNY MICHAEL chased the pace three wide on the turn, lacked a late rally in
the stretch but kept on to be clear for third. WHISPER AND WINK was off a bit slowly, was hustled to the front and set disputed fractions through the turn,
was overtaken in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. NORWESTER lacked early speed, saved ground while trailing through the turn and was not a
factor. PEQUENO AVELITO was quite keen with a high head carriage in the early stages, settled on the turn while outside of rivals, lost ground in upper
stretch and tired late.

Footnotes
MOHAWK KING (IRE) was sent in hand to the front after an alert beginning, set solid fractions while being prompted through the second turn, was kept to
steady encouragement through the lane while all out and determinedly held on to prevail. SHADRACK settled just off of the early pace, improved position
three wide on the second turn, closed well in the final furlong, came within aim in the final strides and just missed for the win while securing the place. TED
attended to the solid early pace from a two wide path, brushed with FUENTE leaving the furlong marker, was outfinished in the final stages and just held for
third. FUENTE (GB) saved ground while settling off of the early pace, improved position on the second turn while still along the rail, tipped out leaving the
turn, made contact with TED leaving the furlong marker and was outclosed in the end, just missing for third. RESPECT THE HUSTLE was three wide on the
first turn while stalking the pace, advanced along the backstretch run, lost position four wide on the second turn and weakened in the drive. NOWHERE
MAN hopped at the start then was sandwiched by neighbors leaving the break, was unhurried through the early stages and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
DESERT DUDE was sent to the front after an alert beginning, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, extended the lead along the second turn
and into the stretch and kicked clear in the end. KALINE was forwardly placed early on, stalked the moderate pace from a two wide path through the second
turn, was outkicked by the winner in upper stretch but held for second in the late stages. OH BE ONE stalked the early pace while on a tight hold on the first
turn, lost ground nearing the half-mile marker, advanced on the inside in upper stretch but lacked a final bid and was edged for third. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT
saved ground while unhurried in the early going, advanced along the inside on the second turn, continued that run into the stretch, shifted out in midstretch
and came within aim of the minor awards in the end. KNOWN settled off of the early pace, mounted a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker but
flattened out in that effort and was outfinished in the stretch run. AWE was a bit slow into stride early on, settled off of the pace while trailing and lacked a
late response.

Footnotes
BROTHERLY LOVE was sent leaving the break, set a contested pace through the first turn, jumped shadows leaving the first turn, extended the lead
nearing the half-mile marker, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, dueled with QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW to the furlong marker, shook free of
that rival and determinedly held sway over the oncoming runner-up. BIG BROTHER was a bit unprepared at the start and floated out leaving the break, was
content to settle through the early stages, was guided four then five wide nearing the top of the stretch, made a good late rally and was not able to reel in the
winner but bested the rest in a good debut. STAY LIT saved ground while setting off of the early pace, gained ground while two wide on the second turn,
continued that run through the stretch and closed well in the end to secure the show. QUIDPROQUO JOEBLOW was forwardly placed early on, advanced
on the second turn to confront the winner, dueled with BROTHERLY LOVE to the furlong marker, was outrun into the final stages and weakened late.
COUSIN MARK bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to settled just off of the pace while three wide on the first turn, gained ground three
wide on the second turn and tired in the drive. BLUE SILVER contested the early pace, gave ground to the winner on the backstretch run while still up close,
saved ground while still in contention on the far turn and faded through the stretch run. TAM'S TIME settled off of the pace while four wide on the first turn,
continued that wide trip through the backstretch run, lost position while five wide on the second turn and did not have a late response. THE LONNA
RANGER steadied off of heels while in tight traffic entering the first turn, saved ground while just off of the pace on the backstretch run, lost ground leaving
the second turn and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
NATURAL COLOUR (GB) was asked for a bit of early speed into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide into the backstretch run, made a steady advance
on the pacesetter on the second turn, overtook I'LL DO IT FOR YOU in upper stretch, edged to a clear lead in the final furlong, felt late pressure from the
runner-up but held safely in the end. GEA was away a bit slowly and was content to settle through the opening stages, kept a two wide path through the
second turn, was steered to the four path and set down for the drive leaving the bend, closed well late and could not get by the winner but bested the rest.
MOMMA MOCCA was forwardly placed early on, lost ground on the second turn and into upper stretch and was outkicked in the late stages, while clear for
third. LOTSABLING was unhurried in the early stages, gained ground three wide on the second turn but lacked a final response in the drive. DAMN THE
TORPEDOES was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, settled off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced on the second turn, continued
that run in upper stretch but tired in the final furlong. I'LL DO IT FOR YOU broke alertly and was sent to the front, set solid fractions through the backstretch
run, was confronted by the winner nearing the quarter marker, battled against that foes bid in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
WINTER FALCON chased the fast pace four wide on the turn, improved position in upper stretch, continued that run in the final sixteenth, made a final
surge and was up in time to prevail. CRAZY DREAMS was away well and was hustled into early contention, dueled for pace duties with HUNTER JOHN
through the turn while carving out fast fractions, lost a bit of ground to that foe leaving the furlong marker, came on again late, vied for the lead in the final
stages and was nipped on the wire by WINTER FALCON for the win, while getting up for the place. HUNTER JOHN was sent from the inside and disputed
the fast early pace, dueled with CRAZY DREAMS through the turn, was able to gain a narrow lead on that foe into the final furlong, was again headed by
CRAZY DREAMS in the late stages and was tagged by WINTER FALCON in the final strides, while being edged for second. TIZ A THRILL saved ground
while chasing the fast early pace, made a mild late gain in the final furlong but was not a threat to the top three. YOU KIDDING ME chased the fast pace two
wide through the turn and did not have a late response. OBVIOUS was fractious in the gate, was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace, lost
ground on the turn and tired in the drive. HERMISTON was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not mount a late rally. MEDAL ICE
lacked early speed and was not a factor. PLAYER OPTION was off slowly and lacked early speed, was steered four wide on the turn, swung widest into the
stretch and did not make an impact. BRUNO B was prominent in the run to the turn while three deep, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and faded
through the stretch run.
