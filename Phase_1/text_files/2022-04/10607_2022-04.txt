Footnotes
CONGRATS AGAIN was outrun early, swung widest turning for home, and rallied steadily to overhaul the leaders a sixteenth out. PORK CHOP pressed the
pace outside rivals, wrested command at the top of the stretch, ran on willingly but could not hold off the top one. SANDY DUDE saved ground to the
stretch, moved to the two-path and was up near the wire to get the show. PIYPA DE LYNDA pressed the pace between horses to the stretch, and
weakened. TACTICAL CHEECH faded after a half-mile. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS bumped with INNER WAVE just past the three-quarter-pole, came in
bumping that rival again, vied inside rivals to the stretch, and gave way. ALFIE'S BOY broke slowest and was always far back. INNER WAVE bumped with
ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS while inside that one going by the three-quarter pole, then was put in tight, hit the rail and fell unseating the rider, and was
vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS INQUIRY, ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SIXTH AND PLACED LAST FOR IMPEDING
INNER WAVE UP THE BACKSTRETCH. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

SKY BRIDGE stalked the pace two wide in the clear, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drove clear. AWESOME PUDDING set as clear pace
inside, yielded to the winner leaving the eighth pole and stayed on to remain clear of the rest. WAR FEATHER raced in range three wide, edged closer in
upper stretch but evened out. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. SIXTY ONE was outrun inside. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
QUANTUM THEORY cleared to the lead entering the first turn, vied inside CANYOUHEARMENOW, got clipped from behind by SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD
while under pressure from both flanks in deep stretch, and held gamely for the decision. CANYOUHEARMENOW moved off the inside on the first turn,
pressed QUANTUM THEORY the rest of the way, could not get by through a long drive and settled for second best. SPACE RUNNER was three to four
wide early, moved in a bit after that, came back out for the drive and gained mildly late. MOONQUEST tracked outside the leaders three wide, and finished
one-paced. ENGINE'S READY was slow into stride, and never factored. SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD saved ground just off the first flight, unsuccessfully
attempted to come through a narrow opening on the rail in midstretch, remained in tight, then clipped the heels of QUANTUM THEORY and steadied 50
yards out. DUNKLE was outrun early, came wide into the lane and failed to menace. GEMINI MOON was never prominent. THE MAR was outrun inside.
THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOCUSING ON QUANTUM THEORY AND SEVEN BRIDGES ROAD BEFORE THE
RESULT WAS MADE OFFICIAL. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CASHIER CHECK angled out midway around the first turn, stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew off under a
drive. BIRDMAN RICHIE raced off the pace outside, steadied midway around the first turn when horses came out in front of him, edged closer three wide
around far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along late for the place. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND was hard held inside, angled out nearing the
quarter pole, angled back to the rail in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally and was up for the show. BACKATYA set the pace in the two path and
weakened in the lane. VANCOUVER D'ORO stalked the pace three wide, was forced four wide midway around the first turn, dropped back a bit down the
backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn, checked near the quarter pole and lacked any further bids. PER RULING #2022025402 FROM THE
FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, CASHIER CHECK WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
COZY CAFE stayed close early, was roused three wide to go after the leaders on the turn, fought outside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL through a stretch-long duel
and narrowly prevailed. PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL vied outside SWEET PEARL early, poked a head in front after six furlongs, was hooked from outside at that
point by COZY CAFE, battled in tight quarters along the rail through the lane and stayed on tenaciously. PRINCESS BETTY broke in bumping KHOSEA into
TIIME TO TWO STEP, went along in striking range two wide to the stretch, and finished evenly to be clear of the remainder. KHOSEA got bumped between
horses at the start, and failed to menace three wide. SWEET PEARL contested the pace inside PAPA'S LITTLE GIRL for six furlongs, and gave way. TIME
TO TWO STEP bumped with KHOSEA at the start, and was no factor. INFATUATING made no impact on the proceedings.

SUSANS NOVELA settled in range inside, angled three wide leaving the three-eighths pole, moved to the front turning for home, vied outside of PROMISE
ME through the lane while appearing to constantly try to lug in and edged ahead. PROMISE ME sped to the front two wide around the first turn, set the pace
along the rail around the far turn, dug in inside of the winner and fought on through the lane. NANA FANNY lacked early speed while racing two wide,
angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the show. CINDY'S SONG had early speed inside, settled behind the pacesetter midway around the
first turn, remained up close inside to midstretch and lacked the needed rally. EISWEIN broke awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, advanced inside down
the backstretch, checked near the three-eighths pole, swung out in upper stretch and finished evenly. SUMTING RIGHT stalked the pace three then two
wide and came up empty in the lane. BASILIA chased the pace two and three wide and had no response. TRUE BLUE PEARL failed to menace while
racing three and four wide. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SARA MIA lagged at the back on hold to the top of the stretch, tipped to the three-path for daylight once straightened away, responded readily and
overhauled CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY from outside in time. CHOOSE TO BE HAPPY broke to the lead, showed the way slightly off the inside to the stretch,
was clear into the final furlong but could not hang on. QUEEN CALYPSO pursued the pacesetter from outside to the stretch, and was outfinished.
CARAMEL MARTINI broke through the gate prior to the start, reloaded and came away without incident, saved ground throughout and needed more late.
GREY CHARLOTTE gave chase between horses two to three wide, and faded in the stretch. FOLLOW ME MOM raced three to four wide, and lacked a
rally. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S PRIDE sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, switched back to the left when urged right-handed near the sixteenth pole
then held clear safe hand urging from there. THE VIRGINIAN chased the pace two wide around the turn and finished willingly three wide in the lane to
narrow much of the gap. BELGRANO gave closest chase to the winner mostly in the two path, gained in the lane but was outkicked for the place. ONUR
(ARG) failed to menace while racing three wide. OLD CHESTNUT played no factor while racing two and three wide. INDY LYON was outrun inside. GHOUL
(BRZ) hit the rail entering the turn, continued to save ground around the bend and was never a threat. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.
