Footnotes
LOVE IN PARADISE eyed the dueling leaders up the backstretch, began closing in on SUMMER ASH after six furlongs, took over outside that rival in
midstretch and drove clear. SUMMER ASH vied early outside THE BEAST, put that one away and opened up on the turn, could not withstand LOVE IN
PARADISE through the furlong grounds and settled for second best. CATCHING MAGIC bumped solidly with PRINCIPE at the start, settled in midpack
early three to four wide, and rallied mildly outside to pick up the show. GHOST FIGHTER raced in the middle of the field two wide to the stretch, moved
inside and lacked the needed response. TWELVE O'CLOCK lacked speed, and passed only tired horses. ONE MORE DAY was five wide at the back
coming off the turn, and remained outrun. THE BEAST argued the early pace inside SUMMER ASH, and was finished before completing five furlongs.
PRINCIPE bumped solidly with CATCHING MAGIC at the start, and was never close. D BLACK MAMBA was through early inside.

PERFORMING ARTS settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer between foes down the backstretch, bumped with PUNX near the
three-eighths pole, angled to the rail not long after, tipped out in midstretch, kicked in and was up late. TETRAGRAMMATON set the pace along the rail,
dueled inside down the backstretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. TULFARRIS (GB) stalked the pace three wide, continued on the
left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. CORRADO bumped with PUNX at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and passed tiring rivals
in the lane. THE BEST DISTANCE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead early on the backstretch, vied to upper stretch and tired. PUNX was bumped at
the start, steadied along inside, was bumped near the three-eighths pole and had no further bids. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
DAYS OF YORE dueled early inside STRASBOURG, got the best of that skirmish early on the turn, lost the advantage to REFUAH with five-sixteenths
remaining, battled back on the rail to regain command in upper stretch, and dug in for the decision. REFUAH tracked the duel three wide, took over outside
DAYS OF YORE late on the turn, relinquished the lead after straightening away for the drive, and ran on to be clearly second best. KING OF CHAOS stayed
in range for six furlongs, could not keep pace with the top two into the lane, and kept on well clear of the remainder. STRASBOURG vied early outside
DAYS OF YORE, could not match strides by midway on the turn, and drifted wide tiring into the stretch. HIDDEN PLAN tired after a half-mile outside.
REDJACK was finished early.

AWESOME BIRDIE stalked the pace three wide, took over in midstretch and powered clear. WITCH OF LOVE dueled two wide to midstretch, was no match
for winner from there but stayed on to hold second. SONGTELLER dueled along the rail to midstretch, could not match strides with the winner and was
narrowly outfinished by her pace rival for the place. CUPID AUSTIN came out bumped LANIAKEA STORM just after the start, raced off the pace inside,
swung four wide near the quarter pole and was one-paced through the lane. LANIAKEA STORM was bumped and in tight just after the start, raced off the
pace two wide, swung five wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. NICOLINO chased the pace two wide and tired in the drive.
CENTSATIONAL GRACE played no factor while racing four wide.

I'M A G SIX was close up early inside, moved outside TUNE IN midway up the backstretch, came under a ride on the turn, could not reach the leader but
stayed on task into the stretch, kept on resolutely and gained the upper hand in the closing stages. TUNE IN set the pace inside, resisted when challenged
by I'M A G SIX on the turn, was clear leaving the furlong grounds but was worn down late. MR TITO'S saved ground through an even effort, and salvaged
the show. LUDINGTON came four wide off the turn, could not mount a serious threat and was outfinished for third. REBELDE dropped far back after six
furlongs. PER RULING 2022-024607 DATED 9-15-22 RECEIVED FROM THE GULFSTREAM BOARD OF STEWARDS, I'M A G SIX WAS DISQUALIFIED
DUE TO A MEDICATION VIOLATION.

the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn then had a mild rally between foes in the lane. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED hopped
at the start, saved ground off the early pace, tugged her way forward inside down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and was one-paced
through the lane. ADELE KAT failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CENTSATIONAL set the pace in the two path and tired in the drive.

PACO'S PICO was sent up inside to grab the early lead, shook off MITICO after a half-mile in the two-path, widened the advantage through upper stretch,
then was all out to keep SENSEI LAWRENCE at bay late. SENSEI LAWRENCE raced in range three to four wide, stayed on his left lead through the lane
and was inching closer to the winner from outside at the wire. MITICO pressed PACO'S PICO from outside for a half, and weakened turning into the stretch.
POSEIDON'S SON saved ground and lacked the needed rally. HEY PORTER spotted the field a couple lengths at the break, and showed little at the back.

Footnotes
MAI TY ONE ON set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. KASIM tracked the pace from the rail,
angled three wide leaving the quarter pole and ran on for the place. J P HELLISH pressed the winner two wide, could not keep pace with that foe in upper
stretch but kept trying and held well enough for the show. CRACK SHOT chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. WORA hit the starting
gate, raced three wide and never threatened. HOPPING HENRY broke a bit awkwardly, raced two wide and made little impact. AMOR LEJANO (ARG)
prompted the pace three wide and tired in the drive. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
SASSY BUT SMART broke to the lead, showed the way in the two-path around the turn, came a bit wider into the stretch and responded well to get the
decision. BEE BY THE SEA was held up in traffic midway on the turn, squeezed through a narrow opening between horses brushing with LOYAL LOUIE at
the top of the stretch, shifted to the rail and finished gamely. LOYAL LOUIE brushed with BEE BY THE SEA while outside that one at the top of the stretch,
and rallied willingly. VINNY DREAM tracked outside the leaders four wide to the stretch, and lacked a late bid. ROYAL WAR moved out five wide leaving the
turn, and made no headway. BOLDNESS bumped with WEIGHT OF GLORY just after the start, and was no factor four to five wide. FREE FLAYME chased
inside for three furlongs, and tired. PERSONAL MEADOW broke three lengths slow, and was always outrun. VENERATE was outrun three to four wide.
WEIGHT OF GLORY bumped with BOLDNESS after the start, pressed the pace outside for three furlongs, and faltered. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
