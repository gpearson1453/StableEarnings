THAT'S THE WAY never far back, closed thee wide on the far turn to draw on even terms for the lead, matched stride the balance of the trip and proved
best by the narrowest of margins. LIL RICKYS JEWEL pressed the pace two wide into the far turn, made the lead, dropped inside, set the balance of the
pace but was caught in the final jump. THE GOSPEL OF MARK passed tiring rivals near mid track. ELLADA PINOT set a slow pace for nearly six furlongs
then weakened. VENTURE ON failed to respond. SPLIT MY BRITCHES was no factor.

Footnotes
KING OF THE RING was brushed entering the clubhouse turn, allowed to settle, moved up steadily three wide through the far turn, matched strides the
length of the stretch and proved best under strong handling. MAN DOWN close up, split horses on the far turn, made the lead, dueled to the wire two wide
and just failed. SWINGIN FRIAR stalked the pace from the inside, slipped through to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, battled the balance of the trip
but was outfinished despite a game effort. STUNNING BABY pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, drifted out through the final furlong and faded.

AYKIZ sprinted to a clear lead shortly after the start, set all the pace, drifted out late and just lasted under right handed urging. BOURBONWITHGINGER
never far back, dug in late in the three path and just missed. DIAL AGAIN chased the early pace along the inside, loomed boldly along the rail nearing the
furlong marker then was outfinished. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE stalked the pace into the stretch, swung wide and came on again late. LUCKY LAUREN
closed gap late in the five path. AFERDITA had good early speed along the inside and went evenly. LITTLE DUTCH GIRL stumbled badly at the start and
was no threat. AWESOME WONDER had brief speed.
