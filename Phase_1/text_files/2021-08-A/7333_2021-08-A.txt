Footnotes
DIXIELAND DREAM set the pace in the two path, showed the way around the turn before kicking clear in upper stretch, then held from a rallying
BOTSWANA TAPS to the wire. BOTSWANA TAPS trailed in the two path into the turn, steadied when aiming to split horses at the five sixteenths pole,
shifted four wide and outside of foes turning for home, then rallied through the lane, claimed place passing the furlong grounds, and sustained a steady gain
on the clear leader, but did not have enough to catch her. WAVE LAND OUTLAW lied close up along the inside early on before tipping to the two path into
the turn, stalked from between horses around then bend, but only managed to chase the leader through the lane while getting outkicked for place in
midstretch. PEQUENO GRANDE tracked along the inside around the turn, but faded through the lane. GRATIFIED stalked three wide, but came under a
drive at the fie sixteenths pole, and tired through the lane.

Footnotes
TOWN BEAUTY was bumped by an inner lunging foe at the start, stalked outside of the dueling pair while in the four path into the turn, ranged up to those
foes approaching the quarter pole, swept past them entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and widened through the final furlong under a statuesque
rider. BRODY SLAM saved ground far off of the pace, shifted three wide entering the lane, then rallied between horses through the final furlong to claim
place approaching the wire. SUA SORELLA brushed the gate at the start and was last away, trailed two wide into the turn, shifted five wide turning for
home, and stayed on outside of foes through the final furlong to vie for place, but was outfinished by an inner rival. SENTIMENTAL CROSS lunged
outwards at the start, dueled for the lead outside of AS YOU WERE while kept in the three path by that rival around the turn, but was overhauled by an outer
foe entering the lane, then lost place in the final sixteenth. AS YOU WERE dueled for the lead inside of SENTIMENTAL CROSS while staying a path off of
the rail around the turn, but offered little resistance to TOWN BEAUTY's sweeping move turning for home, and weakened through the lane. WICKED KITTY
stalked along the inside, but failed to produce a bid. SHIRLEY GREENE lied off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and failed to factor.
LAURA'S ANGLE broke well, but steadily faded thereafter and was outrun.

Footnotes
BUCKETS OF RAIN managed a loose lead down the backstretch, felt pressure from COPPER KING turning for home, dug in to resist that foe's bid inside
the final furlong, and held firm from that foe and outer rallying rivals late. COPPER KING tracked along the inside before coming under urging to press the
leader two wide at the five sixteenths pole, steadily grinded away at that foe's advantage to produce a bid approaching the wire as outer foes did the same,
but was denied by the leader, and saved place. HARD STRIKE trailed along the inside, attempted a five wide rally around the far turn, sustained his charge
through the final furlong while gaining ground outside of the leaders, but ran out of ground. LAKE NAKURU settled off of the pace two wide, maintained that
path while passing tiring foes to claim show entering the lane, chased from outside of the leading pair through upper stretch, grinded away to produce a late
bid between horses, but was outfinished for show by an outer foe. JAMES'S MOONSHINE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. HE'S PRETTY
LUCKY stalked two wide, but faded between horses while floated four wide at the five sixteenths pole. EL FRANCO tracked two to three wide, but faded
while being floated four wide around the far turn.

CODE FOR SUCCESS chased from midpack while under urging along the inside around the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch, then rallied outside of
foes to wear down the clear leader approaching the wire. DELIGHTOF THE NILE stalked two wide, assumed command from the inner leader passing the
three sixteenths pole, cleared off and maintained a margin to deep stretch with CODE FOR SUCCESS menacing, but was worn down by that foe a few
strides from the wire. MRS. NUSHI tracked along the inside, tipped out from just behind the leading pair in upper stretch, but only managed to chase the
leader before being outkicked passing the furlong grounds, then held show. OFF THE CHARTS was bumped by an inner foe while getting a bit keen at the
start, lied at the rear of the field two wide, shifted four wide in midstretch, and moved up in the collapsing pace. RAIN CHECK broke a beat slowly and
bumped an outer foe at the start, saved ground at the rear of the field, and improved past tiring foes through the lane. CATBRIER set a clear pace around
the turn, but offered little resistance to DELIGHTOF THE NILE's bid entering the lane, and weakened thereafter. YELLOW CREEK ROAD took the turn in
the four to five path while far off of the pace, and failed to get involved. NOT SO CLOSE chased three wide, but weakened with five sixteenths to go, and
stopped through the lane.

Footnotes
ATOKA stalked along the inside, smoothly forged place from outer foes under mild urging in upper stretch, shifted two wide to take dead aim on the clear
leader, blew past that foe passing the furlong grounds, and drew off under wraps with a strong finish. SUPPRESSOR set the pace inside of a pair of
pressing rivals around the turn, shook clear from them in upper stretch, but proved no match for the eventual winner passing the furlong pole, and stayed
well clear of show thereafter. SCAT SHACK saved ground while trailing around the turn, and improved along the rail for show while not threatening the top
two. B MAKER pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but gave way entering the lane. HERE MI SONG prompted the pace three wide, but tired at
the three sixteenths pole. TEST OF WILL hesitated and spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, recovered to track two wide, shifted four wide entering
the lane, but came up empty and weakened.

GUNTOWN prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch, and drew off through the late stages. IGNITIS set
the pace while feeling stern pressure from GUNTOWN, but was headed by that foe in upper stretch, proved no match at the sixteenth pole, and was second
best. SCATTERSHACK saved ground off of the pace, improved past outer foes by hugging the inside entering the lane, forged show approaching the
furlong pole, then stayed on to secure show. BON BUENO dwelt a the start while hesitating significantly, trailed early on, improved outside of, and along
with, SCATTERSHACK turning for home, then chased that foe through the lane while failing to catch him for a minor placing. SENSEI LAWRENCE stalked
along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair at the quarter pole, but came up empty, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, and weakened. WE ALL
SEE IT took the turns in the three path while off of the pace, and failed to factor. EAGLE FEATHER tracked three wide, but faded when floated five wide
entering the lane.

BURNING AMBITION vied inside of ASSERTIVE STYLE, shook clear in upper stretch as that foe drifted out, then held sway through the final furlong under
driving pressure. PETER'S KITTEN saved ground while stalking, but failed to keep pace with the leader in upper stretch, chased to claim place from outer
foes a sixteenth out, and secured that position. JEZEBEL'S KITTEN tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and chased the leader
through the lane while outside of PETER'S KITTEN, but failed to catch that for foe place. SPANX LEGACY stalked three wide, but was floated four wide
entering the lane by ASSERTIVE STYLE causing her to fail to keep pace with the leader, kept on thereafter, but was herded outwards by that foe again
inside the final furlong, and failed to reach an inner foe for show. ASSERTIVE STYLE vied two wide, drifted to the three path entering the lane causing her
to be outpaced by her inner counterpart, then lugged outwards again in the final furlong while weakening. RUSSIAN MAFIA lied off of the pace two wide,
gained four wide around the far turn to produce a mild bid at the quarter pole, but faltered when floated five wide entering the lane. ASK BAILEY fidgeted
just before the gates opened then spotted the field multiple lengths at the start, trailed while taking the far turn in the three path, swung six wide turning for
home, but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
UNION SOLDIER tracked from midpack two to four wide, bid for the lead between horses while bumping amongst those foes entering the lane, dueled
between them through the final furlong, and prevailed gamely. ZOFFA trailed, rallied four wide around the far turn, but was bumped by inner foes while
bidding entering the lane, sustained a battle outside of those game rivals through the final furlong, but was outgamed. AWESUMMER lied close up along the
inside, chased under urging into the far turn, tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane to produce a bid, but bumped outer rivals in the process,
dueled inside of that pair through the final furlong, but was bested. AMES MISTER stalked three wide, bid at the quarter pole, briefly led entering the lane,
but gave way to a trio of outer foes approaching the furlong grounds. HEX failed to factor. FUTURO tracked along the inside, but was done early. INDIAN
SPRINGS cleared inner foes around the first turn, set the pace two wide before tucking to the rail into the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch.
PHARAOH'S KITTEN hopped at the start and was off poorly, then got outrun. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF ZOFFA CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH, BUT THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINSIH
