Footnotes
LUNAR BLAST advanced slowly but surely up the backstretch inside, moved out to go after MAMMA J from outside with five-sixteenths remaining, took
over soon after completing six furlongs and drove clear. YES IT'S FREE was slow into stride and outrun early, circled four wide approaching the stretch, and
rallied to be second best. STEVIELYNN hit the left side of the gate to get away slowest, trailed to the turn, moved out three wide near the quarter-pole,
rallied into third through the furlong grounds and finished up evenly. ASPROPODIA raced three then four wide around the turn, improved position into the
stretch but lacked a final bid. J D'S VISTA advanced after a half-mile, stayed in range three wide to the end of the turn, and faded. DRILLZILLA was through
early inside. BELLA GABRIELLA was outrun three to four wide. MAMMA J sped clear early inside, got collared by the winner after six furlongs, and gave
way. PALOMA MIA tired after a half-mile. SYLLABUS dropped far back on the turn, and jogged in.

SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL settled off the duel in the clear, split rivals two wide turning for home and drew off under a drive. CAJUN COUSIN pressed the pace
three wide, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted in through the final sixteenth and was up for the place late. BLUSHING KEYLEN vied inside of foes to upper
stretch, could not keep pace with the winner nearing the eighth pole but stayed on well enough to hold third. SHE NASTY was off slow, raced well back in
the two path, swung widest in upper stretch and improved position. LAST LEAF dueled between foes to upper stretch and tired. YEARS AGO steadied near
the nine-sixteenths marker, raced three and four wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
KHOZMORE brushed with JOYOUS FAIRY TALE at the start, pursued FRU FRU ZAN early, took over outside her stablemate in the four-path coming off
the turn, was roused mildly in midstretch and kicked away hand urged. FRU FRU ZAN set the pace inside, proved no match for KHOZMORE by upper
stretch, and ran on best of the others. STARSHIP NUGGET raced four to five wide around the turn, posed no threat to the top two but was much best of the
remainder. WALKS LIKE A LADY gave chase three to four wide to midway on the turn, and faded steadily after a half-mile. TIZ IMPRESSIVE raced near the
inside and was never a factor. CRYSTAL LAGOON was difficult to load, and faded inside before reaching the stretch. JOYOUS FAIRY TALE broke through
the gate prior to the start, brushed with KHOZMORE at the start, and showed brief speed before dropping far back. MARIAHS CHRISTMAS was outrun
three wide. EFFIES GIRL was never close. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

PUDDING stalked the pace from the rail, angled out nearing the eighth pole, surged outside and was ridden out. DOUBLE CROWN settled off the early
pace, advanced three wide around the turn, took over turning for home, drew clear in upper stretch, led to deep stretch but had no answer for the winner
late. TONALISM raced well off the pace and four wide and rallied for the show. ONE FAST set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. JACKSON
pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole but came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
FLAMINGO HAWK raced three to four wide advancing after a half-mile, caught the leaders from outside coming to midstretch and drove clear.
DEMOCRACY walked out of the gate, was outrun for a half, moved out in the stretch and rallied to go clear of the others. THE DISTRACTOR pressed
GATSBY from outside early, took over after a sharp half, then yielded to the winner in upper stretch. ANOTHER DUKE saved ground outrun to the stretch,
and finished with some interest on the rail going by tired horses. OH STEVE shifted out four wide leaving the turn, and could not threaten. BIG THORN
raced two to three wide around the turn in range, and faded in the drive. GATSBY set the early pace hounded by THE DISTRACTOR, could not hold that
one off after a half, and gave way.

Footnotes
RACE DAY SPEED settled off the pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, kicked in in upper stretch and rolled past under mild urging. COZY
CAFE was in range three and four wide, took over near the quarter pole, quickly cleared in upper stretch, had no response for the winner in the final
sixteenth but held well to be clearly second best. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL saved ground in midpack, angled out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and
was along for the show. LOVIN LIVIN hopped at the start and bumped with IZSHEFROSTED, raced well back inside for five furlongs topped out in upper
stretch and passed tiring rivals. MARICOPA steadied at the start, raced well back four and five wide and improved position in the lane. LEYENDA failed to
menace while racing two wide. YOU'RE THE BEST tracked the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. THE BIGGEST ONE set the pace
along the rail and faltered nearing the lane. IZSHEFROSTED was bumped at the start, advanced two wide down the backstretch, vied two wide around
much of the turn then stopped nearing the lane. ASTROMELIA was outrun while racing three wide. MANGROVE MAMMA had brief speed three wide.
