Footnotes
MILLENNIUM FORCE was off slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide on the turn, launched a determined drive, had
command well into the final furlong and held under a strong hand ride. STERLING SPEED raced in mid pack, was hustled and angled from the rail to
three-wide late turn then rallied gamely. STARLIGHT RIDGE, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn then closed through the
stretch. SYSTEMIC RISK set a pressured pace, had the rail for the run through the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch but was passed in the final
furlong and chased to no avail. MRS. DEL raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn then rallied belatedly. FOREST DRIFT stalked the
pace, moved from the rail to two-wide into the turn, chased after the leader but drifted four-wide late turn and lost ground then flattened out mid stretch.
SILVER DAHLIA, away slowly, settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn but lacked a rally.

determinedly. SEA ANNA DREAM settled off the early pace, was hustled four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. DISCREET
BEAR, rated off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide through the turn and rallied gamely outside. SOMEONE ELSE was herded inward leaving the gate,
settled in mid pack, angled from the rail to three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. HOLD THE APPLAUSE was herded inward leaving the
gate and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, moved back to the rail in the stretch and finished gamely. THE GOOD
WITCH pressed the pace, chased from two-wide and the rail on the turn then leveled out in deep stretch. WHAT A BEAUT raced in mid pack, dropped back
two and three-wide through the turn then lacked a rally. DAISY JANE broke inward and moved up to press the pace, stalked from the rail on the turn but
lacked a closing response.

GOLDMINE CAT chased the four pace rivals while outside two foes, tipped out three to four wide late on the turn and loomed in the five path in upper
stretch, layed in when passing the pacesetters at the eighth pole and opened up, kept to task to hold off the closing second place finisher. TYCOON off
slowly and off the pace, rallied two to three wide on the turn into range and tipped out in upper stretch. closing well while failing to change leads down the
lane, easily second best. CARL G stalked and pressed while three wide throughout, bid with a rival in upper stretch when inside the winner but outside his
pace rivals, game for the show but no match for the top pair. WHERES MY HALTER broke out and brushed a rival at the start, recovered to stalk and press
the early leader inside two other rivals, stayed on until the eighth pole and was outgamed for show by a rival to his outside. UNLIMITED TALENT between
rivals in a group of three behind the early leaders, closing well to best the balance down the lane without threatening. BOKERMIN four wide in midpack
early, rallied mildly while three to four wide on the turn and inched up in the final furlong without menacing the top finishers. OVER THE HILLS was taken
back while wide early, circled three to five wide on the turn and was rallying mildly while still outside in the final furlong. CRAFTY CONQUEST won a mad
scramble for the lead and inched away on the turn but was swallowed up by numerous rivals at the eighth pole and retreated. BETTER BOOGIE had a nice
rail trip in behind a group of leaders, but had no kick when room appeared in upper stretch. KEEN SAMURAI jumped up at the start and settled along the rail
off the pace, no response when asked on the turn. COPINSAY along the rail and off the pace, never in contention. ANTE UP ALEX trailed backstretch,
circled four to six wide on the turn and stalled in upper stretch in the middle of the track. DE ONLY SOLUTION four wide and pressing the early pace, fell
back while wide on the turn and could not contend.

ANOTHER led on the first turn, set a reserved pace, held a comfortable lead on the backstretch, quickened on the turn then was all out to hold. COURTLY
MANNER stalked the pacesetter, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn then finished gamely. PERLARANA settled off the pace, came three and
four-wide through both turns, was hustled along then rallied outside and gained steadily. FIRST SPRING, in range, rode the rail then finished willingly.
GREENFIELD raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch and leveled out. CHEEK TO CHEEK settled in mid pack,
came through both turns three and four-wide, was hustled along and finished evenly. GORGEOUS KITTEN was checked in tight quarters passing the wire
for the first time, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail on the far turn, rallied, but evened out late. DISTINCT PASSION stalked the pace, chased
two-wide late turn and evened out with a 16th to run. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL, in mid pack early, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the far turn, ran
into a blind switch mid stretch and flattened out. MOSCOW MINISTER settled well off the pace, trailed the field, was hustled on the far turn but never

in mid pack, was hustled late turn then rallied along the rail. WICKED CRAZY broke inward and bumped KIDDIE HOLIDAY, raced in striking range, chased
hard six-wide late turn, rallied gamely but did not get off a bid. LATE SURGE, bumped at the start, settled well back, was hustled on the turn then rallied
outside and closed a gap. I'M A CHI TOO broke outward and bumped THELONIOUS, forced the pace, bid mid turn, dueled, then gave way a furlong out.

chased into the stretch but was lugging in and evened out. THELONIOUS, bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, was set down upper stretch but evened
out in the final 16th. INCENDIO, in range, dropped to the rear on the turn but lacked a rally. PERFECT PICTURE, bumped at the start, was quick to the fore,
set a pressured pace, was headed at the top of the stretch and retreated. SAILOR'S PASSION was bumped at the start, forced the pace, chased three and
four-wide on the turn, tired a furlong out and faded.

Footnotes
FEDALIA chased the top pair between rivals, got a seam between stopping pacesetters in upper stretch, cleared off but needed the wire late to win a
desperate photo. SECRETS TOLD was inside the winner and chasing a trio of leaders around the turn, followed that foe and got through at the three
sixteenths, flying late but just missing. USING COCONUTS broke out at the start, had one rival beat late on the turn, came inside into the stretch before
shifting out to the six path at the eighth pole, finding her best stride and closing for show in the final sixteenth. LADY AT BLAME stalked the early leader,
took the lead late on the turn but could not get separation in upper stretch and was headed by the winner at the three sixteenths, dropping a few positions to
closers in the final eighth. IN MY OPINION sat in midpack along the rail, angled out late on the turn to be three wide, loomed outside the leaders in the four
path in upper stretch but stalled at the eighth pole. BIG GINGER stalked the leading pair three wide throughout, looked dangerous outside turning for home
but flattened out in the final furlong. TWISTER ALERT trailed by a wide margin until passing a few stragglers in the final sixteenth. GWEN led while being
stalked and pressed by a rival, was headed midway on the turn and faded down the lane. HARVEST wide and off the pace down the backstretch, mildly
rallied three to four wide on the turn and was steadied in upper stretch when the show finisher came out but there was no evident advancement in the cards
when that occurred. CRYSTAL CRESCENT between rivals and off the pace, had room to go in upper stretch but could not quicken and take advantage of
the oppurtunity. RECIPROCAL rallied three wide on the turn into midpack but could not sustain her bid and shortened strides in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LORD OF LEGENDS was sent to a clear early lead, set a reserved pace, quickened on the turn then widened under a drive. TIZ ROMANTIC stalked the
pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. KAWACATOOSE settled in striking range, was hustled from the rail on
the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. MAD DOG N JOE raced in mid pack, was hustled two-wide to the rail on the turn then showed some
interest in the stretch. COUSIN BOB settled in mid pack, was hustled four and five-wide through the turn then finished gamely from the outside.
PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ was bumped by ZEPHYRTIZER at the outset, settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, then was all out
in the stretch but failed to menace. DAWSON SILVER settled off the pace, chased two-wide on the turn then finished gamely to no avail. ZEPHYRTIZER
