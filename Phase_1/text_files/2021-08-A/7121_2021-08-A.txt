Footnotes
SOUTHSIDER was sent for speed and soon cleared, saved ground through the turn on a well-settled lead, was engaged by GUMWRAPPER into the lane,
opened up when hand urged past the three sixteenths, and held sway to the end under a mild drive. GUMWRAPPER tracked the leader outside of HIGH
HERO, continued to stalk the leader two wide on the turn, loomed two wide into the lane, was turned back from the three sixteenths but chased on willingly
to the wire. HIGH HERO tracked the leading pair inside, joined inside of GUMWRAPPER into the turn, was relegated to a clear third past the three eighths
while saving ground, turned for home inside behind the leader, chased on mildly the rest of the way but lacked the needed kick to improve position. YOUNG
CORBETT settled at the rear, saved ground through the turn, was driven inside into the lane, but did not muster the needed rally while drifting out slightly.
MAGI came away last, settled second from the rear, chased in the three to four path on the turn, continued in the four path into the lane, and offered no
response.

Footnotes
SEVEN KINGDOMS dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch, opened up down the lane and held off a late closer under a drive to the wire. JULIAISON bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate,
rated in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, continued up what remained up the backstretch between horses, navigated the turn
from the three path and gained ground steadily in late stretch. NOFANSINTHESTANDS chased the leaders on the inside through the opening half mile,
saved ground around the turn, and finished evenly on the rail, while proving to be no match for the top two. GRAPEVINE led the field with a narrow
advantage up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, gave way entering the stretch and faded between horses from there. TIZ A
QUEEN hit the gate leaving it, was forced to steady slightly and switch to the outside in the opening quarter of a mile, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid approaching the turn, raced in the two path from there and flattened out in upper stretch. JANE'S GOLD TOUR bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop back while running in the two path
around the turn and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
LADY MAGNA was asked for speed inside, led past the eleven sixteenths, saved ground on the pace through the turn, opened up into the lane, went to a
drive approaching the furlong mark, and drifted out while remaining clear to the wire. HOPPESTRY tracked inside of FIRST SQUADRON early, raced at the
inside of the cashing flight approaching the half mile mark, chased while saving ground around the turn, was driven for an inside bid into the lane, could not
get to LADY MAGNA but kept on with continued interest to the wire. LADY EXPRESS broke inward and bumped HEY HEY in the opening strides, settled at
the rear, continued to trail in the three to four path on the turn, swung five wide into the lane, and kept on mildly for show while drifting out slightly. FIRST
SQUADRON tracked outside of HOPPESTRY early, advanced to stalk outside of LADY MAGNA past the five eighths, continued in range two wide on the
turn, was driven into the lane but proved no match for the pacesetter, and flattened under a drive in the lane while drifting out late. CONSTANCIA came
away well, was outsprinted by LADY MAGNA past the eleven sixteenths, settled back to join the chasing flight between horses, continued midpack between
horses around the turn, flattened two wide into the lane and was no further threat. HEY HEY was bumped by LADY EXPRESS in the opening strides,
settled in second last, inched forward to join the chasing flight three wide approaching the half, raced three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the
lane and weakened.

quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch and dueled gamely in the final furlong. WHITE MIST angled in to save ground around the first turn, opened up a
three length lead racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way around the far turn and dueled gamely down the lane, refusing to yield late. TOM'S
LAST GENERAL trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, swung out to race in the three path around the far turn,
improved position in upper stretch and chased the winners home, proving to be no match for those rivals. DOM CAETANO (ARG) raced in the two path
around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was outkicked in the
stretch. FRONTIER CHARLIE was off a bit slowly, raced into traffic and steadied slightly headed into the first turn, saved ground from there, raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, and weakened on the rail in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LAKE MILLS took mild early pressure while setting the pace inside, saved ground while setting the pace under restraint on the turn, slightly increased his
advantage when pushed along past the three sixteenths, and held sway under a mild drive in the final furlong. DASTARDLY DEEDS raced inside toward the
rear early, continued near the rear of a compact field while saving ground on the turn, inched forward between LOOK AWAY and the rail approaching the
quarter, was driven two wide into the lane to make a bid on LAKE MILLS, kept on willingly the length of the stretch, was making slight gain late but could not
reel him in. LOOK AWAY prompted the pace outside of LAKE MILLS early, stalked two wide around the bend, was driven three wide into the lane, dropped
to the inside in upper stretch, and chased on no match for the top two. DREAM ATTACK settled at the rear for the backstretch run, raced three wide in the
rear flight into the turn, raced in the four path near the rear of a compact field on the turn, was asked near the five sixteenths, raced four wide into the lane,
but lacked the needed rally in the lane. B G ATTACK chased toward the rear between horses down the backstretch, continued two wide between into the
turn, settled back into a clear last past the three eighths, was driven inside into the lane, and had no response. KING'S STORY stalked the pace three wide
down the backstretch, continued in the three path in the stalking flight outside of LOOK AWAY around the bend, stopped at the quarter, continued to drop
back when driven in upper stretch, and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
SKIP THE SMALLTALK alternated between dueling for the lead and pressing the pace on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the
two path around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, and wore down his rival to pull clear in the final furlong. NAVY PIER led the field by a short margin up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and into the stretch, gave way with a furlong to go and had to settle for second best. KINGSBURRY
ATTACK raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground
on the outside from there. MUNCH raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two path, made a mild gain
of ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong. COLD BIRDIE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of
a mile, saved ground around the turn, raced evenly in upper stretch and weakened late. BEHAVIN MYSELF raced at the back of the pack throughout, came
around the turn in the two path and made no bid. A P BLAZING GREEN broke slowly and veered in sharply leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field the
entire way around the oval and was never a factor.

Footnotes
JETTIN OUT raced four wide toward the rear early, advanced to track the leading pair outside of UPHAM into the turn, tracked three wide around the bend,
came into the lane in range while still three wide, rallied, struck the front approaching the furlong mark and held. DEMAND RANSOM came out in the
opening strides and bumped with GRAND HIDEAWAY, chased inside near the rear, raced keenly inside into the turn, chased in the two path around the
bend, shifted out four wide in upper stretch, rallied under a drive and just missed. GRAND HIDEAWAY came out slightly in the opening strides and bumped
with DEMAND RANSOM, raced between horses toward the rear early, continued two wide near the rear around the turn, took closer order outside of
UPHAM in upper stretch, altered out five wide midstretch, found his best in the final sixteenth and gained belatedly. MR. ELEVENTH HOUR prompted the
pace outside of GIVIN UP NONE down the backstretch and through the turn, came into the lane between horses behind the leader, kept on in range
between horses in upper stretch, and flattened out in the final furlong. OVERPRAISE settled at the rear, trailed in the four path on the turn, was taken five
wide in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. UPHAM raced three wide toward the rear early, edged forward to track the leading pair inside of JETTIN
OUT into the turn, saved ground while tracking the leading pair around that bend, was keen inside behind GIVIN UP NONE near the quarter, stumbled when
taking up on heels behind GIVIN UP NONE while turning into the lane, stayed on his feet but lost position while recovering his stride, and continued willingly
late. GIVIN UP NONE was hustled for speed, set the pace inside while prompted by MR. ELEVENTH HOUR, led inside into the lane, was headed
approaching the furlong mark, and faded inside. STEWARDS MADE AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT TURNING INTO THE STRETCH, WHEN UPHAM
TOOK UP ON HEELS BEHIND GIVIN UP NONE. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PLUS CHIC hit the gate and was off slowly, made up ground quickly on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to make a bid from the rail nearing the
three eighths pole, saved ground from there, dueled in upper stretch, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off down the lane. DRESSED chased the
leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, gained ground on the outside in upper stretch, could not go with the eventual winner in the
final furlong and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. DING DING led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way while
saving ground around the turn, was caught with a furlong to go and weakened further in late stretch. CHACALOSA raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, and made a mild improvement of position in late stretch. GWENDOLA raced
off the pace on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, and passed tiring horses down the lane. MIZHIPZLETUS trailed the field on the
inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. CLEVER KITTEN was
reluctant to load, broke well and trailed the field between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and made no bid. LIZY D raced in
the middle of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn, and faded on the rail entering the stretch. SIMPLY
COMPLICATED trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, raced at the back of the pack in the two path around the turn, and was never a factor.
