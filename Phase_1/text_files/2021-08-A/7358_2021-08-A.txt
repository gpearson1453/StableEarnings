GOVERNOR ARTHUR brushed MR BOTANICALS leaving the gate, settled just off of the early pace from SMILING PATRICK, was two wide on the turn
while tracking that leader, slipped to the rail for the stretch drive and had a late push in the end to prevail. TALISKER BAY settled near the rear of the field,
was two wide on the turn, rallied off of the turn but was outkicked in the stretch by the winner while besting the rest. ADD ON had no speed in the early
going, was three wide on the turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch to earn the show. MR BOTANICALS hopped at the start and was brushed by
GOVERNOR ARTHUR leaving the gate, chased the pace while four wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. BETTER TOMORROW tracked the
leaders through the turn while three wide between foes, gained ground off of the turn but gave way in the stretch run. SMILING PATRICK broke on top and
set the quick pace through the turn, was two wide on the turn, was headed leaving the turn and tired in the stretch run.

ALLIE'S PAL broke sharply and set a quick pace into the turn while saving ground, kicked clear in the stretch and was geared down at the end. ISLA ROSE
chased the pacesetter into the turn while two wide, swung out for the drive and was no match for the winner but an easy second over the rest. MICKEY
DOBBS tracked the winner into the turn while two wide, lost ground on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. DANIELA BELLA settled toward the rear of
the field, was three wide on the turn and lacked a late response in the stretch. WINNING VALLE stalked the early pace, was three wide on the turn, lost
ground into the stretch and gave way in the late going. COASTARANDO was away a bit slowly and had no speed early, was two wide on the turn and was
not a factor.

SWANEE pressured PEARL DRAGON on the front end in the early going, continued to duel with that rival on the turn while two wide, put that one away and
pulled away in the end to prevail. SENORITA ESTRELLA stalked the dueling pacesetters while saving ground on the turn and made a late bid in the stretch
to win the head nod for the place. GLITTER LAKE bobbled at the start and chased the field in the early going, saved ground on the turn and rallied in the
stretch and just missed for second. KATE BOSS chased the pacesetters while three wide on the turn, lost ground off of the turn and finished evenly in the
stretch. PEARL DRAGON broke on top and dueled on the front end with the winner, saved ground on the turn but lost position into the lane and weakened
in the stretch. ST. ANNIE'S INDY settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the turn and did not rally in the late stages.

QICK QUACK QUO in the final strides to prevail. QICK QUACK QUO settled toward the rear of the field, mounted a bid on the second turn while saving
ground, led off of the turn and into the stretch and was nailed in the final strides by BLAKEFORD while clear of the rest. AMITY HARBOR attended the pace,
was three wide on the second turn, and was outkicked in the stretch. ROBIE sat just off of the leader on the backstretch, waited for racing room on the
second turn while in tight quarters, and was outfinished in the stretch. FOREST VICTORY chased the early pace, lost ground on the backstretch, mounted a
bid on the second turn while four wide and finished evenly in the stretch run. PERSEVERANCE made a middle move to contest the pace, was four wide on

but dug in and outdueled that foe while holding off OH BE ONE at the end in a game win. OH BE ONE prompted the pace by EARNEST, was three wide on
the second turn, made a late gain in the final sixteenth and pressured the winner but was outfinished while holding on for second. MOONLIGHT BLUE
tracked the pace through the second turn while two wide on that turn, confronted EARNEST off of the turn to take the lead but was outdueled by that one in
the final sixteenth while not able to hold off an oncoming OH BE ONE for the place. UBER STAR stalked the pace through the second turn, was three wide
on the turn and weakened in the stretch. LINGUA FRANCA sat just off of the early pace, gained ground while four wide on the second turn but tired in the
stretch run. TYLER'S TEK settled in the midflight, was five wide on the second turn while improving position but gave way in the stretch. ONE EYED ROBIN

Footnotes
KODIACTION never far back to the second turn, saved ground to the stretch then shifted out, responded to pressure and wore down ROUEN late. ROUEN
The latter had the best speed, set all the pace in the two path to the stretch, responded to mid stretch then could not stal t he winner. BIG CITY BANE was
hurried early to press the runnerup to the second turn, raced three wide to the stretch then was outkicked to mid stretch and did not rally. BALIUS had no
speed, trailed to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch then could not threaten in the drive. MCGEORGE was chasing to the half, raced two wide on
the second turn and also lacked a closing response. ROARING TIGER bobbled at the start then recovered to stalk the pace in the four path for six furlongs
then was also outrun to mid stretch and weakened. BROKEN FINGER had no speed, was three wide throughout and never a factor.

Footnotes
JUNGLE CRY disputed the pace with SHORE BREAK(IRE) three wide, continued to duel two wide to the stretch, responded to edge away to mid stretch
and held under steady urging. CODE DUELLO chased the leaders to the second turn, made a bid three wide to the stretch but was outkicked by the winner
to mid stretch and was second best. SHORE BREAK (IRE) alternated on the lead inside the winner to the five sixteenths, was outrun in upper stretch and
finished evenly. MISTY CAT had no speed, trailed to the second turn, saved ground then shifted out for room and inconvenienced STALKING SHADOW in
mid stretch and did not rally late. STALKING SHADOW also had no speed, was outside of MISTY CAT to the stretch then shifted away from that one in mid
stretch and lacked a late response. JOYMAKER stalked the leaders to the second turn, was four wide to the stretch then tired. The stewards conducted an
inquiry into the stretch run involving MISTY CAT and STALKING SHADOW but found no reason to alter the results.

Footnotes
LINFIELD was unhurried in the early going, improved position on the second turn while coming five wide, continued that run into the lane and dug in in the
final sixteenth to get by ROBBER BARON to prevail. ROBBER BARON sat just off of the early leaders, was three wide on the second turn, vied for the lead
inside of the furlong marker but was caught in the final sixteenth by LINFIELD while holding for second over the rest. MY SUNSHINE attended to the early
pace, was four wide on the second turn, took the lead off of that turn but was outkicked in the stretch. CHOSEN MOON settled toward the rear of the field,
was two wide on the second turn while gaining ground and continued that run into the stretch but was outfinished by the top three. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE)
stalked the early pace, mounted a bid on the second turn while two wide but finished evenly in the stretch run. MEGAMEISTER sat off of the early pace,
was four wide on the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch. SINGLE BARREL prompted the pace by C'MON JENNA, was three wide on the second
turn while gaining ground on that one but faltered in the stretch. C'MON JENNA broke alertly and set all of the fractions, was challenged throughout by
SINGLE BARREL, was headed nearing the top of the stretch and tired in the stretch run. DI LAURIAN settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on
the second turn and did not rally in the stretch.

Footnotes
TALE OF THE TAVERN broke on top and was sent to set the pace, was two wide on the front through the turn, was kept to task through the stretch and felt
mild pressure at the end from SWEET TOPPER but won in a drive. SWEET TOPPER prompted the pace in the turn by the winner, steadily gained on TALE
OF THE TAVERN off of the turn and into the lane but could not reel her in while besting the rest. LADY DOC settled toward the rear of the field, was three
wide on the turn, made a mild gain on the leaders into the stretch and finished evenly in the stretch run. MY BELLA CHICK chased the winner for the first
quarter, lost ground on the turn while four wide and weakened in the stretch run. LADY MOHICAN chased the pace from a ground saving position but was
outrun off of the turn and tired in the stretch. CONSENTIA stumbled and unseated the jockey at the start. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START REGARDING #2 CONSENTIA AND DETERMINED THAT SHE CAUSED HER OWN TROUBLE AT THE BREAK AND THAT THERE
WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER.
