Footnotes
LAUTREC vied for the lead three wide, finished determinedly under a strong hand ride and proved best in the final yards by the narrowest of margins. KING
RICHIE away alertly, set all the pace, dug in gamely when joined by the winner and just failed. ROGALLO pressed the pace two wide, had his heels clipped
just past the quarter pole then went evenly. MOST SANDISFACTORY moved closer two wide before a half then failed to sustain that bid. BANDERAS was
in tight along the rail entering the clubhouse turn, saved ground, clipped heels with ROGALLO just past the quarter pole then faded. SAN RULER was
outrun. KULP was through after a half. THE RIDER OF BANDERAS LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF ROGALLO FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE ON THE FAR TURN. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

IMPERIAL KING battled for the lead three wide into the stretch, gained command before the furlong marker then widened the balance of the trip under left
handed urging to win as much the best. LATIN SPICE dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch and gamely held on for second. SCARED WARIOR
broke outward bumping a rival at the start then had a mild rally late in the four path. TIME TO SHOOT was bumped between rivals and squeezed at the
start, rushed to contention along the rail before a quarter, matched strides into the stretch and weakened late. GRANDGRAN bumped at the start then failed
to menace.

TALKBACK prompted the pace from the five path early, angled in on the turn, drew on even terms for the lead before the quarter pole, matched strides until
deep stretch then surged clear late under mild left urging. BLACK BUTTE stalked the pace into the stretch, had a mild late rally in the five path and got up
for second. READY TO CHARM made the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace until mid stretch, dug in gamely but was outfinished. JILLY FROM
JERSEY close up, dropped back on the turn, swung wide then came on again late in the six path. LUMINAIRE advanced three wide on the turn then failed
to sustain that bid. PURE SUGAR trailed.
