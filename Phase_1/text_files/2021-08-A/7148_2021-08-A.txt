Footnotes
BALA FALLS was up close, a factor from between foes on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. PRECIOUS
BADGE settle off the leaders, raced evenly on the turn and rallied late but just missed. UNION APPRECIATION showed speed from the inside, had the lead
on the turn and vied from the four path at the top of the stretch in a good effort. A GERSHWIN TUNE stalked the leaders from the outside and was roused
on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch had no late kick.

turn and had the lead in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. CURLIN WORLD was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and from the four path
through the stretch held show. OPTIMYSTICAL showed no speed, moved up on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch was up for a
share. SETSON was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. SALT MINE TEDDY was
in touch and hustled along on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out. JMR AWESOM SILENCE tracked the leaders and was
roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. J M R TURGUCCI showed speed from the inside and had the lead on the

Footnotes
PETAL set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task. LAXMI stalked the leader and was a factor on the turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch was second best. MISS MATILDA was in range and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. FAIRY
was off slow and gained ground on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was all out. MOLLYTARA was in mid pack and hustled along on
the turn but had no rally. I'M A GINGER was in touch but chased on the turn and had no kick. TARA EMPIRE was hustled early and raced evenly on the
turn but came up empty. SMOKEHOUSE was off slow, showed little and had no impact. STARONTHEHORIZON was off the pace and showed nothing in a
dull effort.

at the top of the stretch held show. TOBRUK was away alertly and had a good position on the turn but had no late kick. HESATHRILLER showed no speed
and closed the gap on the turn but was no threat. J M R VICTORY LAP was in touch and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. DYNA'S GAMBLE was
in range and raced evenly on the turn but pulled up in mid stretch.

Footnotes
LIL'S TURN was unhurried early, raced evenly on the turn and with a bid at the top of the stretch drew clear. MARTINI SUE set the pace and had the lead
on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. BENADETTE'S LADY stalked the leader and dueled on the turn but
from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. ROMANTIC BLISS showed no speed, saved ground on the turn and from the three path at the top of
the stretch was the best of the rest. I HAVE FEELINGS was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no
response. MUSICAL FLIGHT was well back and had a mild gain on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch evened out. DANZIG RAINBOW
was away alertly but chased on the turn and failed to fire. SILENT CHARITY was off slow and a factor on the turn but came up empty. GLIB MARYLIN was
off the pace and showed nothing in a dull effort.

inside on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. SUBZERO PLUS was in range and a factor on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch needed more. BLONDILIKESTODANCE was off the pace and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top of the
stretch was all out. OUR PETUNIA was hustled early and had a clear lead on the turn but from the three path through the stretch gave way late.
ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA was away alertly but chased on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty.

turn but evened out through the stretch. TOTAL BETTY was in range and hustled along on the turn but needed more. DOODLE DANDY was off the pace
and gained ground on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was all out. MI TIA REGIS was well back and saved ground on the turn but
was not a factor. SILVER SUNRISE was away alertly and had a mild gain on the turn but had no impact. CURT'S ANGEL was unhurried early and raced
evenly on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was no real threat. ONLY BELIEVE was in touch and roused on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch had no response. STREET JOY stalked from the outside and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the top
of the stretch weakened. SPLENDIDA showed speed from the inside but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch. ONE LUCKY WOMAN
