MID DAY IMAGE set the pace on the inside racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, responded when asked turning for home, kicked away
and was ridden out. CASH CALL KITTEN tracked along the inside, chased between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and rallied for
second. DRILLOMATIC stalked two wide early on, chased inside on the far turn, dug in gamely on the rail in the stretch run and earned the show spot. KING
OF SPADES raced off the pace inside, angled out for the drive and closed belatedly outside. BEACH TRAFFIC raced off the pace inside, then between
rivals, rallied two wide on the far turn, raced between horses in the stretch drive and weakened. BARINGER SPRING raced three wide off the pace, came
four wide into the lane and weakened. SMALL HOPE raced three wide early, settled off the pace and did not factor. PROMISE ILLGETYOU raced off the
pace between rivals and faded.

TAKAFUMI (BRZ) in the stretch run and was outkicked between rivals late. ETERNAL SUMMER stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, could not

Footnotes
PIRATE PARADE set the pace on the inside, opened up a comfortable lead, responded when roused, was kept to the task and held well to the end. RED
MULE raced off the pace inside, moved up between rivals at the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch drive and got up late for second. SAN ANTONE
settled off the leader, rallied into the stretch, dug in gamely and lost second late. TIGER KINGDOM raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and
finished evenly on the rail. LUCKY AS A SEVEN raced between rivals leaving the chute, chased on the turn, came four wide into the lane and weakened.
BARAHIN raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. GRAND UNION hopped at the start, raced three wide leaving the chute, saved
ground on the turn and did not factor. POP POP'S BOY stalked outside, lugged out on the turn, dropped back, was eased and walked off.
