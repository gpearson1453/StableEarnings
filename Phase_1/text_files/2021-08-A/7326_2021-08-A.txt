Footnotes
BRING DA FUDGE, at the rear early, angled from the rail to four-wide late turn, rallied, led in the final furlong and widened under light handling. CHASING
DESTINY broke outward but gained a quick lead, set a pressured pace, was headed mid turn, stayed close along the rail then rallied in the stretch and was
up for the place. LITTLE MISS CAT pressed the pace from the outside, bid four-wide and took the lead mid turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was
passed in the final furlong and chased to the end. SEA FRET pressed the pace, bid mid turn from the second path, was outkicked by LITTLE MISS CAT to
the stretch then evened out in the final furlong. THE TWELFTH pressed the pace, forced the issue three-wide into the turn, was taken back a bit mid turn,
chased four-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.

NOW WE ARE NINE settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, rallied outside and outkicked YOLA late. YOLA stalked the pace,
was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn, launched a determined stretch drive but was outfinished in the late stages. BLIND TRUST dueled briefly
then pressed the pace, forced the issue on the turn, bid approaching the stretch and moved clear but was passed in the final 70 yards. CAPTAIN
HANDSOME, in range, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn then chased through the stretch. SPRING EDITION settled well off the pace, was
hustled on the turn and gained steadily through the stretch. NORTHERN SOLUTION vied briefly and drew clear, set a pressured pace, was headed at the
top of the stretch and faded.

WESTLODGE INTRIGUE led quickly, set a reserved but pressured pace, dashed clear from the top of the stretch then held under a drive. CANADIAN
MAGIC stalked the early pace, closed up and forced the issue on the turn, chased into the stretch and launched an all out rally. MODUS OPERANDI broke
slowly and settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn then gained steadily through the stretch. RINCE TAPAIGH stalked the pace,
chased three-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. BIG MAMBA broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide
through the turn then finished evenly from the outside. FINDING PERFECTION broke well but settled in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the
turn then rallied gamely between foes. LINE OF VISION hopped at the outset and settled off the pace, saved ground on the turn but never reached
contention. SPROG stalked the pace, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

SPEEDY LYNN forced the pace, lodged her bid leaving the turn, drove clear a furlong out and was all out to hold. POLAR APPEAL raced in mid pack,
chased hard 2-3w through the turn, finished under a determined drive and just missed at the wire. NO WHAMMIE settled off the pace, was hustled thee and
four-wide on the turn then rallied gamely from outside rivals but missed. CLASSY GIZMO settled off the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn
then rallied gamely. ARRA GO WAN set a pressured pace, quickened on the turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way grudgingly. CHIEF STEW broke
outward, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then evened out in the final 16th. HIT AND RUN stalked the pace, chased from the rail on the turn then
lacked a closing response. ALPHA MIA broke slowly and settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn then lacked a rally.
