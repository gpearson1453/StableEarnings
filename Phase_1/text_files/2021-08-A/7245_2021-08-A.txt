Footnotes
JILL showed early speed, set the pace, quickened on the turn then held sway under light handling. MY FINAL TRICK stalked the pace, chased along the rail
late turn and finished under a determined drive. FLAT OUT FABULOUS pressed the early pace then dropped to the rear of the tightly knit group
approaching the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied along the wood. TOUCH OF ROUGE was off slowly and settled at the back of the pack, chased
two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. REDHAIR N FRECKLES stalked the pace, chased two-wide into the stretch but failed to menace. ENHANCED
FINANCE raced off the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn then showed mild interest in the late stages. DOWN TO EARTH stalked the pace, was
hustled three-wide on the turn and chased through the stretch. KEYED UP was off slowly, stalked the pace, was hustled four-wide through the turn then
lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
READY HERO raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from two to four-wide on the turn, rallied between foes and led in the final 16th under a hand ride.
STRIBLING led early, set a reserved pace, was roused upper stretch but was passed in the final 16th. DYNAMITE DUKE, off slowly, settled in mid pack,
came three to five-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished with a determined drive. VICTORY TOWN stalked the pace, took a bad step
near mid turn, recovered quickly, was gaining in the stretch but evened out late. NEWPORT AGENT, in range, was hustled from the rail on the turn and
chased through the stretch. BENLION, away slowly, settled off the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn then finished gamely while widest in the
stretch. RACING IN THE RAIN, in touch, came four-wide through the turn then finished evenly. JACK, in range, chased three-wide late turn then flattened
out in the late stages. SUGAR RAY, steadied at the start, raced in mid pack, lost his path behind rivals three-wide 3/16ths out and finished evenly. SPIRAL
STORM, in range, was hustled along the rail on the turn, hit the fence upper stretch and lacked a rally. SUNRISE DRIVE was steadied at the start, settled
off the pace and was never in contention. VIEW FROM EGBERT raced in mid pack, came four to six-wide on the turn, dropped back approaching the
stretch and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
RAKASA rushed up the fence to maintain rail control and get the lead, shook off her pace rival late on the turn and had a clear advantage in upper stretch,
holding on to her diminishing lead in the final stages. OL' BLONDIE broke out and brushed the gate at the start and trailed the field, well off the pace before
commencing a three to four wide run on the turn, came widest around rivals down the lane with an excellent rush to grab the place spot late. RAVEN ECHO
went to her nose at the start, recovered quickly to chase outside a rival behind the duo in front, tipped out two to three wide turning for home to loom outside
that front pair, gamely beating the rival she raced alongside the entire trip for the show at the wire. KNOW HOW (GB) chased along the rail behind the
leading pair, a very nice inside trip but could not kick on down the lane and was outgamed for show by the rival she raced inside of all the way. GOLD
FORESTER settled three wide off the pace early, roused around the turn in the two path and closed mildly down the lane to beat the rest, inching up in the
final sixteenth. CORA chased along the inside, dropped back around the turn and rallied along the inside down the lane without threatening. NO MORE
FENCES settled off the pace, came up along the fence on the turn and angled out in upper stretch, finding her best stride late while outside of rivals.
SILENZIO had an awkward beginning, sat in midpack in the two path, over to the rail on the turn and rallied mildly in upper stretch before levelling off in the
final furlong. WICKED MIAH off the pace and three to four wide outside the place finisher on the turn, no rally forthcoming. PESARO stalked and pressed
the winner throughout, fell back mid turn but took another shot nearing the turn for home, tiring in the final furlong. MI TORMENTA trailed by a good margin
down the backside, the rider having some difficulty along the rail and never able to mount a charge.

Footnotes
BURNING MAN pinched back at the start and was off the pace on the first turn, commenced a three wide run up the backstretch to get into position,
continued to advance four to five wide on the far turn and fanned out to the six path turning for home, kept coming outside down the lane and after a slight
brush with the place finisher in midstretch got the lead at the sixteenth pole, in hand the final two strides. VELOCE chased the top pair outside a rival,
moved up two to three wide inside the winner on the far turn and fanned out into the five path turning for home, outkicked by that rival but holding on to the
place spot late. GIANT CRITIC chased in midpack along the rail, dropped back on the far turn but was re-energized down the lane and rallied inside the top
pair outside the tiring pacesetters, game for the show. LION KINGDOM trailed all the way until tipping out in upper stretch and finishing with a strong, eye
catching late rally but running out of real estate up behind the leaders. LUCAS N' LORI was bumped at the start and off the pace, in the two and three path
on the turns but could not muster a rally of any kind. MATINEE broke in and bumped a rival at the start, took the lead quickly but was stalked and pressed
by a rival throughout, kept going until the eighth pole when headed by the top pair, giving ground from there to the wire. FINAL STRIKE stalked the leader
throughout, bid for the front midway and late on the far turn but was repulsed by the leader, falling back in the final furlong. DETROIT STEEL (IRE) broke
out at the start, settled in chasing the leaders along the fence, asked for run midway on the turn but did not respond.

FOREST SURVIVOR dueled on the backstretch, gained a short advantage approaching the turn, set a pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch,
widened under steady encouragement and held the late running GALVASTON safe under a drive. GALVASTON bumped JOCULARITY leaving the gate,
settled in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide on the turn, swung out for the drive and rallied fast but was too late. JOCULARITY, bumped at the
outset, showed brief speed then settled in striking range, was hustled along the rail on the turn and chased through the stretch. DRAGON'S BREW broke
outward and settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn then finished willingly. ALL CANADIAN was prominent on the backstretch, forced the
pace on the turn, chased into the stretch but tired a 16th out.

POST TO POST settled off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn, rallied outside and was up just in time. STORMY SUMMER led into the first
turn, set a reserved pace from the rail, quickened on the first turn, was all out in the stretch but was caught on the wire. CRUMLIN TIME stalked the pace,
came four then three-wide through both turns, bid approaching the top of the stretch, was quickly headed but rallied smartly and just missed. CRUMLIN
QUEEN stalked the pace from the rail, was hustled into the stretch and chased gamely to the end. EXPRESS BANKING pressed the pace, lapped onto the
leader on the far turn, challenged in earnest approaching the stretch but was headed and gave way after a brief chase. DESERT POEM settled off the pace,
came along the rail and two-wide through the far turn, chased into the stretch but never reached contention. FINEST JEWEL was steadied at the break and
settled in mid pack, chased two-wide into the stretch but evened out in the final 16th. SOTHATSTHEWAYITIS settled off the pace, was hustled two and
three-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.
