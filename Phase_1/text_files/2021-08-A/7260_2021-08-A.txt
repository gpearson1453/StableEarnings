after showing mount the whip hand riding to the wire. DOUBLE DOT was prompted under early pressure through the backside, overtaken on the far turn
chased to upper stretch digging deep there to hold reasonably well. NOMIRACLESNEEDED carried in a bit at the break lagged early giving a mild move on
the far turn racing evenly in the four path down the lane. TAILADIOS raced evenly failing to mount a bid. SWEEPENO slow early proved no factor.
MELISANDE pressed the early pace fading on the far turn. SHESAROCKSTARTOO rushed out pressured for a half then wilted on the far turn.

gave a middle move to press on the backside then wavered dropping off on the far turn racing evenly through the lane in the two path. LADY BREANNA off
slowly was always a step slow advancing minimally on the far turn laboring home the final eighth. PRINCESS TIZNOW tracked for a half mile then faded on
the far turn. DIXIE RED gave a prompted middle move then folded abruptly on the far turn.
