Footnotes
REGAL LADY settled just off of the early pace, was two wide between horses on the turn and mounted a long bid off of the turn and found more in the final
stages to prevail. DESERT SMOKE stalked the early leaders while saving ground, gained ground off of the turn but was outfinished by the winner while
holding for second. VANGOGO dueled for early pace duties with PREMIERE LADY, was four wide on the turn, led into the stretch but was caught in the
final sixteenth and was outfinished by the top two. COASTAL STARLITE settled toward the rear of the field while saving ground and made a late rally in the
stretch. WICKED SUNSET was away a bit slowly and chased the field from the rear while saving ground in the two path and showed late interest in the
stretch but was not affecting the leaders. PREMIERE LADY contested the early fractions with VANGOGO, was three wide on the turn and weakened in the
stretch run. SLIGHTLY chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while three wide and was not a factor in the stretch run.

MEET MISS KITTY chased the field in the early going, was four then five wide on the turn to confront the pacesetters, mounted a run leaving the turn,
engaged ROLINGA inside of the final sixteenth and just won the head nod at the end. ROLINGA contested the early pace, was four wide on the turn, had a
late lead inside of the final sixteenth but was nailed by the oncoming winner at the wire while holding for second. ZELAIA dueled for early pace duties while
saving ground on the turn, was tiring in the final stages when overhauled by the top two but was a clear third over the rest. MISS SKI contested the early
pace through the turn while three wide, was outrun off of the turn and weakened in the stretch run. NAMORITA was away a bit slowly, chased the leaders
into the turn, steadied off of heels leaving the three-eights marker and did not rally in the stretch run.

HYDROGEN sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, gained ground into the stretch, was roused and made a late push to get by
MANY ROSES to prevail. MANY ROSES set comfortable fractions through the second turn while saving ground, was urged off of the turn and eventually
outfinished by the winner inside of the final sixteenth while holding for second. UNLAWFUL ACT stalked the early pace, was four wide on the second turn
and made a late bid in the stretch to hold for third. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT settled off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn and showed late
interest in the stretch, just missing for third. IZ INVINCIBLE stalked the early fractions while saving ground on the second turn, mounted a bid off of the turn
but lacked the needed late response. ANGELO'S PRIDE was away slowly and trailed through the early going, was four wide on the second turn and was not
a factor.

end. BLUEGRASS SKY was away a step slowly and chased the field in the early going, saved ground on the turn while improving position but was
outfinished by the winner while holding for second. RUNNIN DIVA settled off of the early pace while saving ground on the turn and rallied for third in the
stretch. BRITE TAN chased the pace through the turn while four wide, lost ground off of the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. PERFECT EDITION
chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while five wide and gave out in the stretch. CUTETIP was hustled to challenge WICKS AND CHAPPIES in
the first quarter, was rank and hard to place while losing position on the turn and was not a factor in the late going.

Footnotes
COMBAT ZONE contested the early pace with SARNI, rated nicely through the backstretch, was two wide on the second turn, had a clear lead off of the
turn and was mildly pressured in the final sixteenth by the runner-up but held on to prevail. KODIACTION sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on
the second turn, made a late rally in the stretch and put mild pressure on the winner but could not close the margin while besting the rest. HONOS MAN
settled in the midflight while saving ground, gained ground off of the second turn and into the stretch but lacked the needed late response. LORD
WIMBORNE (IRE) settled off of the early pace, was four wide on the second turn and showed late interest in the stretch to challenge for third. SARNI
contested the early pace with COMBAT ZONE, saved ground along the second turn while still dueling on the front end but was outrun off of the turn and
gave way in the stretch drive. CANYON CREST was unhurried in the early going, trailed through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MINOSO sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn, was urged on in the final sixteenth and responded to get by
HYPERSONIC and edge clear to prevail. HYPERSONIC prompted the early quick pace by MY FATHER FOOTSTEP, was three wide on the turn, had the
lead in deep stretch but was outfinished by the winner while holding for second. HULA KING stalked the pace while saving ground on the turn and made a
mild late gain to get third. MY FATHER FOOTSTEP set a quick pace through the turn while saving ground, led into the last furlong but weakened in the final
stages. HE BE MOJO RISIN settled off of the pace while traveling two wide on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch run. MIKE OPERATOR stalked the
pace, was four wide on the turn and tired in the stretch. PEQUENO MONTE had no speed in the early going, was four wide on the turn and did not rally in
the stretch run. HARDY CHISEL settled off of the pace, was three wide on the turn and was empty for the stretch run.
