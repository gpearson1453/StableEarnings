Footnotes
TUCUM was quickly clear, set the pace off the rail, drew away under moderate urging. WATFORD raced off the early leaders outside foes seven wide into
the turn, ran on to gain the place while no threat to the winner. BONFIRE PARTY stalked the winner, went three to four wide on the turn, didn't have enough
in the stretch. SECRET'S DOUBLE was up close early racing inside, failed to rally. HALF COURT SAM was very hard to load, raced well back two to three
wide on the turn and improved position in the stretch. SPURS N LATIGO was reluctant to load, raced mid-pack inside on or just off the rail, had no rally.
JAZZIE DREAM went outside foes eight wide on the turn and was not a threat. COLOR ME GONE steadied from between rivals six deep entering the turn
when in a bit tight, failed to rally. FLYING WARRIOR chased the leaders from inside foes but going five wide on the turn, dropped back and faded. WHERE
IS TROCHU broke inwardly a bit, chased briefly along or just off the inside, steadied near the three-eighths while getting out a bit, dropped back and faded.
ORGULLO MIO was reluctant to load, steadied in tight quarters soon after the break, entered the turn nine wide moving in to about four deep then back out
nine wide, faded. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF COLOR ME GONE AGAINST WATFORD ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION
WAS TAKEN.

CANOODLING tracked from between runners, moved to the fore by the three-eighths going three wide on the turn, kicked clear under steady handling.
ZAMARA settled off the leaders, made a nice middle move outside foes five wide on the turn to reach contention, proved no match for the winner. BRAVE
CINDERELLA settled off the leaders, dropped back two to three wide, swung five deep out of the turn, ran along for show. SHANGHAI KEELY vied inside
early, dropped back and shifted out five wide past the seven-sixteenths, made no late bid. REVENOOR WOMAN broke a step slowly, shifted out and
advanced four wide between runners to reach striking distance then flattened out. SPUN LINE tracked from inside and had no rally. AMEERAH B had early
speed racing two wide into the turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
RAAGHEB, unhurried early and well back heading into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend, came out seven deep at the top of the stretch, drifted
in late while surging past. BLACK OPS tracked inside into the turn, came out a path on that bend, moved into upper stretch three wide, drifted in a path and
kept on well but was outkicked. COMPETITIVE IDEA got away alertly, allowed a foe to go on with it content to stalk four wide, took the lead at the top of the
stretch, was overtaken late and in tight at the wire while weakening. MAGIC MOSCO made a four to five wide advance on the turn, asked for more at the
quarter, could not kick on and was in tight late. NIFTY tracked two wide early, moved to the rail on the turn, failed to rally. DINAR was off the pace early,
edged a little closer three wide into the turn shifting out five wide on that bend, had no rally. FLAT FAST was coaxed forward to clear the field and set the
pace in the two path, came up empty. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MAGIC MOSCO AGAINST RAAGHEB ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
FULL OF DRIVE was urged inside early, outrun heading into the turn and shifted out while losing ground, came five wide to the quarter pole, got up late and
held off an outside challenge. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE settled off the leaders, made a sweeping move outside rivals five to six wide on the turn, continued to
rally in the lane but just missed. MOVE IT MISTER was unhurried early racing off the inside, went in the three to four path on the turn, came out in upper
stretch and gained to get up for show. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE vied three wide between runners, drifted in a hair in upper stretch, dueled inside a foe in
mid-stretch, kept on to defeat that runner but was outkicked by the top three. TYGER TENNESSEE pressed from outside going four wide on the turn, led
from the quarter pole till past the eighth pole but flattened out. LATIGO RIO vied for the lead racing off the fence, was in a bit tight near the three-sixteenths
as a rival came in just slightly, weakened. DIVE BAR chased the leaders early, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. SKEETER WHO raced
off the inside and was outrun. MISTER KOWEN settled mid-pack, advanced inside on the turn but faced some traffic past the quarter, angled five wide into
upper stretch and was within striking range but faltered and faded.
