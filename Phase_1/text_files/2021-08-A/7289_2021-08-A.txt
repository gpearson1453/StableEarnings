sway late to prove best under a drive. EXPRESS LADY was allowed to settle early, then made a three wide move on the turn to move into contention,
angled out five wide for aim on the front runner, then was getting to the rival late but could not go by while clearly second best. CECIL'S ANGEL stumbled
slightly at the start, then chased the early pace and advanced towards the inside, angled out in the drive but was empty while lasting for the show award.

Footnotes
IRON LADY AWAY set the early pace on the inside, then turned back a bid leaving the turn and shook clear by the furlong marker, then was kept safe to
prove best under a drive. KATIE'S BELLE was allowed to settle early on the inside, then closed well on the inside to close the gap late. SACRED PEACE
(FR) was reserved early while saving ground to leaving the turn, then angled out to have a wide rally gaining the show award late. BLESSING THE FLAG
was well placed early on the inside, swung out three wide for the drive but had no kick. LOFTHOUSE prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide
bid to press the winner by the quarter pole but flattened out in the drive. CAJUN KID was reserved early while three wide into the turn, then angled in to be
towards the inside in the drive but had no rally. LIZ C was allowed to settle while two wide, swung out five wide for the drive but lacked a rally.
INSPEIGHTFUL stalked the early pace four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
GOLD BUCKLE was well rated early while four wide, made a five wide swoop on the turn, hit the front leaving the turn and moved in to the three path, then
drew off in the stretch to prove much the best while being fully extended. SKY LIBERTY dueled for the lead in between rivals, made a bid two wide on the
turn and proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. GO RODNEY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but
came up empty in the drive while besting the rest. EVEN MONEY passed the tiring rivals. JUST DIG IT ducked in at the start, then was hard to handle and
moved to the outside, then lacked a rally. RILEY RICH dueled for the early lead on the inside and faltered. HERBIE DERBIE DAY failed to menace.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CONSUELA was rated along early, then made a three to four wide move on the turn, took over leaving the turn and drew clear by the furlong
marker, then drew out in the final furlong to prove best, driving. MORE APPROVAL stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and went up to tracked the pace
and made a three wide bid to shake clear by the five sixteenths pole, then was headed by the winner leaving the turn, proved to be no match for that rival
while clearly second best. SHOTGUN KATIE chased the early pace four wide, then was five wide into the drive and was empty while besting the rest.
HEATED KISS was reserved early towards the inside, then made a run three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and had no late rally.
SEQUEEKER was allowed to settle early and was three wide by the quarter pole but lacked a rally. TWO LUCKY was settled back early, then was on the
inside by the quarter pole and failed to menace. WANTING set the pace from the inside and gave way. ELLIE'S DISPUTE chased the pace five wide and
stopped. DE LA CHA CHING stopped.
