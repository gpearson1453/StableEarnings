Footnotes
FORGOTTEN ONE ducked out while breaking sharply, made all the pace while racing out from the inside and widened under brisk urging. FLYIN IT was
unhurried, made a run in the three path around the final turn but failed to sustain through the lane. WOOD BEE pressed outside the winner in the three path
into the far turn then tired. ATHENASWAY stayed inside and lacked a rally. ARCTICA was prominent between rivals early, angled to the rail on the
backstretch and stopped after six furlongs. SHINE LIKE BOBBY was outrun.

Footnotes
HAY BUCK took command at once, stayed close to the inside into the stretch then held while drifting badly. INTROSPECTION split rivals while moving on
the backstretch, steadied in tight between foes entering the far turn, vied outside the winner through the lane but wasn't enough. GALILEO'S AFFAIR lagged
early, raced two wide around the final turn and gained late between rivals. SIMMARD SHENANIGAN settled outside and lacked a closing. MONACO
PRINCESS advanced four wide around the first turn, pressed outside the winner into the final furlong then tired. IZZADORA BELLA raced within striking
distance along the rail to the far turn then tired.
