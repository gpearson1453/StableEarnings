Footnotes
RAILMASTER was never far back along the rail, rallied to the front just before a half then began to draw off soon after. ANY SUGAR HONEY raced two
wide outside the winner into the stretch but couldn't keep up after a half. WEST FORK was slow early, raced the three path around the turn and improved
position outside through the lane. MEMORY BOUQUET made a three wide run around the turn, loomed between horses into the final furlong then flattened
out. AMERICAN QUALITY was hustled clear soon after the break, stayed inside into the turn, ran out entering the stretch and weakened. INDOCTRINATE
moved closer between horses into the final furlong but failed to sustain his bid. CLASSY SOLUTION was outrun. MR. DODA trailed.

raced wide around the turn and outfinished the others while no threat. OSCAR WINNER raced three wide and passed tired ones in the lane.

STONEHARBOR BLONDE moved to a short lead before going a quarter, was displaced on the turn, came again in late stretch and prevailed. GOING
GOING GONE made the early pace, was displaced before a quarter, came again midway on the turn then gave way late. GOLD TIME VIXEN steadied
behind the first flight while trying to rally into the stretch, angled out for room in early stretch, bid into the final furlong but lacked the needed closing. MISS
CONSTITUTION raced three wide with the pace into the final furlong then weakened. TONIGHT MAYBE lagged after a slow break, made a mild run into the
stretch then flattened out. MAGICALLYDELICIOUS was eased up late while outrun. HERE I COME stopped and was eased up.
