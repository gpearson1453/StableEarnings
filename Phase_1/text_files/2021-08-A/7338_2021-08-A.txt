but dug in under steady handling to hold on well. THE KING AQUILES stalked two deep, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the
rail on the far turn and finished well to be second best. MALIBU CIRCLE settled off the pace about the three path, started a bid toward the three eighths
pole, continued in the three path of the far turn and was along for third later yards. NOW I'M BROKE raced off the pace toward the inside, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then flattened stride later yards. NEW SOUTH stalked the earlier pace off the rail, started a four
wide bid at the three eighths pole then weakened leaving the far turn. YOUREASCOLDASICE saved ground.

ALLTHEWAY TO CAIRO chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail, eased out entering the stretch, dug in to get up later yards and
widened nearing the wire. STRONG LIKE BULL accelerated to the lead inside at the three eighths pole, drew clear into the turn, was steadily encouraged
from the eighth pole but gave up the lead while flattening stride later yards. UNNAMED SOLDIER chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about
the four path, drifted a bit into the lane, though, finished well while gaining on the runner-up. WON DOZEN BANKS gave chase, raced in the five path of the
turn and finished evenly. GRANDPA MUNSTER led the opening three sixteenths of a mile then gave chase from the three eighths pole, contested at a close
disadvantage in the three path of the turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. UNION GRACE stumbled after the start and lost his rider. Pursuant to
Stewards ruling #56, Alltheway to Cairo is disqualified from earnings.

Footnotes
CHANGE THE WORLD pressured the pace three wide on the backstretch and took a slim lead two deep approaching the quarter pole, dueled clear into the
stretch, was steadily handled to mid-stretch then hand urged the final sixteenth. MY JUBA was bumped at the break then pressured the pace four wide,
dueled at a close disadvantage three wide on the turn and settled for second best. HESSICA was bumped at the break then gave chase through the
backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path then dug in from the head of the lane to take third the final strides. A BLONDE THING came out to make
contact with My Juba leaving the gate then gave chase outside, raced in the five path on the turn, briefly occupied third mid-stretch but was nipped from that
position the final strides. LA CUBANA came out to make contact with Hessica leaving the gate then pressured the pace two deep, but dropped back at the
five sixteenths pole and faded near the rail on the turn. GHOSTLY SQUALL ducked in at the break and was steadied leaving the chute, picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little further. CASTLE LIGHTS was hustled up the set a pressured pace from the
seven sixteenths pole, gave up the nod nearing the quarter pole, dropped back at the rail toward the head of the lane and weakened into the stretch.
WAGER WORTHY raced briefly close then faded past the three eighths pole. HOOK THE CHAIN was not a factor. WITNESS THE ENERGY was not a
factor.

Footnotes
THE IRON BANK settled off the pace inside on the opening turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three
path, dug in for the lead later yards and raced clear under the wire. CANDYGRAMFORMONGO was hustled clear and rated the pace inside, came under
pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave up the lead later yards and just held on for second. SOUTHSIDE WARRIOR rounded the first turn in the four
path and raced well off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the five path of the far turn, finished
well and just missed second. LITTLE LEO saved early ground racing well off the pace, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and entered the far turn about
the four path, angled to the seven path approaching the top of the stretch and passed rivals outside. CARMELO raced in the four path the first turn and left
the turn outside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the three path then flattened through the lane. ADIOS
HILLARY raced in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. LONDON WEREWOLF stalked the earlier pace from the
two and three paths, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. TOMMY'S TOP CAT saved early ground and
showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
RIGHTEOUS RENEGADE settled off the pace inside, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and drew close three wide on the far turn, then dug in at
the head of the lane to take over later yards. HE'S NOT CURLY rated a slim lead inside, maintained the edge over Absalom leaving the half mile pole and
contested the turn at the rail, dug in from the top of the lane to put that one away but was caught in later yards. TIZEZZY raced well off the pace about the
three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path, then steadily improved to take third under
the wire. ABSALOM raced with the pace through the front stretch then stalked into the opening turn, drew to near even terms past the half mile pole,
challenged at the five sixteenths and raced close two deep on the far turn, though, flattened inside the sixteenth pole. CHARITABLE VISIT stalked the early
pace from the three path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and ran in the five path of the far turn, then raced evenly to late stretch before
flattening stride. BOBBYFROMTHEPALM raced well off the pace and off the rail on the first turn, bid from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off
the rail and showed little further. ROSSIE VAL raced off the pace in the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch.

NAVY SWORD settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, started a bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed to take the lead in
the three path approaching the top of the stretch, raced clear at the eighth pole and was steadily handled to draw away. PRINECESS DOIR was bumped at
the break and settled off the rail the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close at the rail on the far turn, angled to the three path
approaching the top of the lane, dueled for second in the upper stretch and just held on. THE BETTER ONE exchanged contact with Anna Rocks leaving
the gate then saved ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and closed to a hemmed in position off the rail nearing the head of the lane, angled to the
three path at the eighth pole and finished well while just missing second. BOUNDTOBEBAD raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn in the five and six paths, though, flattened the final sixteenth. LETTS GO TO DIXIES took over and
angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the rail nearing the head of the lane then weakened
inside the eighth pole. ANNA ROCKS exchanged contact with The Better One leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the
turn outside and bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more. RHYTHM TREE stalked two deep then
gave chase into the backstretch, though, faded on the far turn. THAT KENNEY KID broke outward to make contact with Princess Doir then rated close
inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole then weakened while losing ground on the far turn.

Footnotes
SUPER MALIBU rounded the first turn in the three path and settled off the pace into the backstretch, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, took the
lead in the three path into the far turn and drew clear midway through the turn, then held well under steady stretch handling. I'M EXCEE saved ground
through the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and improved in the three path of the far turn, then ran evenly down the lane. RAINBOW RIVER
saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole then steadied past the five sixteenths, angled out into the far turn and raced in the five
path through the turn, then ran evenly in the stretch. COWGIRL NIGHT raced in the five path the first turn, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and
ran close off the rail on the far turn, moved to the rail at the eighth pole but showed little more. SARAH BELLUM rounded the opening turn about the four
path and was well off the pace into the backstretch, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, lacked room toward the head of the lane and
angled to the five path at the eighth pole, then passed rivals. RACHEL'S WISH raced in the four path the first turn and was just off the pace into the
backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the five path on the far turn. SINGLE MOM rated close to the early pace inside, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole and angled to the three path midway on the far turn, then weakened. TRINNI SUNSET raced well back, made a mild
bid from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the six path. SHO U RIGHT stalked three wide on the first turn, gave chase from the three
eighths pole then faded on the far turn. WOMEN NOT EASY took the lead two deep nearing the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving
the three eighths pole, was caught at the quarter, checked at the rail at the inside flank of Cowgirl Night midway on the far turn then weakened leaving the
turn.
