Footnotes
PHANTOM POWER vied outside for the lead, fanned three wide into the turn gaining a short advantage over her inside rivals and drew clear in stretch. RED
ECHO hurried inside but was outsprinted to the turn, chased through the stretch but was unable to reach the winner and held place. FRAN FROM PERU sat
just off the early pacesetters, drove four wide into the lane and lacked the kick that was needed. PERPETUAL BLISS lacked early speed needed inside,
angled out into the stretch and passed tiring rival. KNOWENTOHOLDUM hustled between in the early stages and was unable to keep pace with the field
nearing the three sixteenth marker. SWEAT EQUITY offered some early speed and was outrun.

OUT FRONT bumped leaving the gate, contended the early pace inside of CAPA BELLA, dueled through the turn outside of LIGHT FAST FEET, gained the
lead into the stretch and held under steady pressure. CAPA BELLA bumped away from the gate then vied for the early lead, dropped back in the turn,
re-rallied four wide into the lane and was gaining late. LIGHT FAST FEET broke outward, moved up alongside OUT FRONT to challenge the lead in the
turn, was unable to move on with rival into the stretch and flattened out. AWESOME GIGI stalked the early stages and faded steadily. STOLEN JEWEL
bumped away, hurried into contention leaving the backstretch and had nothing left in reserve.

the backstretch, shifted outside and improved deep stretch. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER bid between rivals leaving the backstretch and faded steadily

NO COLLUSION rated off the pace from the four path, shifted inside leaving the backstretch, moved up three wide alongside CHATTY GAL, edged away
then drove clear in stretch. CHATTY GAL showed the way through the backstretch, lacked a response to challenge from NO COLLUSION at the quarter
pole and held safely for place. GO MAMA tracked outside, raced three wide into the far turn and was unable to improve position. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI
showed little. NO BAKK TALK pressed the pace from the four path under a snug hold and was done early.

Footnotes
DAZZLING CHIC allowed to settle early, rallied in the four path through the lane, angled in to the three path at the head of the stretch and was up late for
the win. LIA'S ON TUNE tracked four wide, bid three wide at the five sixteenth pole, gained a slim lead and was out finished. CAN'T TOUCH THIS hurried
two to three wide and lacked a closing response required. LA MER set the pace from the rail, was unable to move on with outside rivals with a furlong
remaining and yielded. SAMURAI GIRL reserved off the early pacesetters and lacked a serious bid. ASTARTOBE outrun throughout.

CHILLIN WITH CHIP saved ground while setting the pace, disposed to rival into the far turn, pulled away when given her cue and proved much the best.
SCARLETTE ROSE trailed outside, bid between foes at the head of the stretch and got up in time. SAYGE'S SPIRIT tracked the early pacesetters, roused
at the quarter pole then went in pursuit of the leader and was caught late. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL rallied belatedly and failed to threaten. APRIL'S IMPERIAL
offered little. YUKON MIST prompted the pace, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and tired.

LADY BENGEL vied outside, gained an advantage through the turn, came under steady handling into the stretch and held under a late drive. GLINDA
GOOD WITCH chased early, waited for running room in the final turn, rallied three wide into the stretch and closed steadily missing out. LIL OL FLATTER
trailed the field, came under light handed urging after the quarter pole, was all out late and earned show. TALA sent for early speed in the four path from the
rail, dropped to rail approaching the far turn, drove four wide and flattened out. EMERALD CANYON attended the early pace, dropped back through turn
and was roused to no avail. LUCY TREASURE pressed the pace from between foes, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and gave way inside.
SALTY O'DAY shuffled back in the early going, settled outside and tired.

Footnotes
PRESS GANG rated off the pace outside, circled into the lane, closed determinedly outside and got by in time. MINSKY MOMENT prompted the pace from
the two path, inherited the lead approaching the quarter pole, saw margins diminish early stretch and was caught late. MY SAMURAI WARRIOR tracked
outside from second flight, gained closer order leaving the backstretch, rallied five wide into the lane and inched up for show honors. STOCKWATCHER
tracked inside, lodged a bid into the lane while two wide, raced through traffic into the stretch and was narrowly denied for show. STAPLETON gained closer
order in the final turn, lodged a rail bid and was edged out. MY LUCKY MARK reserved off the pacesetters, rallied three to four wide into the stretch and
flattened late stretch. MIDNIGHT SHAKE lagged early and showed a mild interest late. BOLSANO saved ground early and failed to menace.
NORTHERNLOCOMOTIVE contested the early pace, was unable to sustain the bid that was needed and tired. TRANG showed little. POWER OF
INTENTION never reached contention. AWESOME ANTHONY saved ground and was done early.
