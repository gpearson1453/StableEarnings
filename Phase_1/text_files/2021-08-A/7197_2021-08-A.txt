on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced five wide on the far turn, then outfinished for second late yards. SUPER MALIBU settled just off
the pace and off the rail, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. ADDY'S
LOVE took the lead at the three quarter pole and angled in to rate the pace from the five eighths, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths, was
met at the three eighths and dueled close from that point, but dropped back past the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. QUINCYS WAY saved ground
off the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, entered the stretch about the three path and showed little
further. RACHEL'S WISH rated close inside the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn. CASTLE OF
CAYLEE ran in the three path on the first turn and raced well back.

of the far turn, took the lead past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to keep WIDGET FACTORY at his withers, while the latter stalked the early pace
two deep and moved to even terms approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to the lead two deep midway on the far turn, was caught past the eighth pole
but continued on gamely to the wire. EL ROJO raced well off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and came
through the far turn in the three and four paths, finished well to take third the final yards and was gaining on the top two. GOOFY BOY was shuffled back at
the start and raced well back about the three path the first turn, eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the five path
of the far turn and finished well outside. FLAMING HOT raced off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and ran
near the rail on the far turn, then finished evenly. BROTHER SKYE rated a slim lead inside, was met approaching the three eighths pole and dueled from
that point, gave up the lead at the rail midway on the far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. MARU'S RAVEN saved ground well off the pace, picked
up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. FIFTY SEVEN CHEVY raced in the four path the first
turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded in the five path of the far turn.

RIVER CROSROAD RVF raced close while well reserved, eased out with a bid into the stretch and dug in to take over later yards. DERBY DAY DREAMS
took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and was
steadily handled through the lane, but gave up the lead later yards. PISTOL P saved ground off the pace, started a bid approaching the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. MISSIONSNINETYNINE rated close in the four path the first turn, bid nearing the
three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, though, showed little further. LUFTY'S KISSES saved early ground then eased out into the
backstretch, bid approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little more. SONDE ST BLUES raced off the
pace about the three path and showed little response through the backstretch. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE stalked two deep, picked up the chase from the three
eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn.

DECO STRONG stalked in the three path then took the lead approaching the seven sixteenths pole, contested the advantage off the rail on the far turn, dug
in under steady stretch encouragement and held off the late arrival of AZZURRA, who settled close off the rail on the opening turn then eased out into the
backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced close in the three path of the far turn, dug in to take second mid-stretch and finished well.
SLINGIN SAMMY B took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, gave up the lead nearing the seven
sixteenths and gave chase from the three eighths pole, but dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth. GRACE
ELIZABETH stalked the early pace off the rail, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. LADY MACHO settled
back in the three and four paths the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and showed little
further. IMAGOODCHATTERBUG settled back off the rail then bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and showed little more.
