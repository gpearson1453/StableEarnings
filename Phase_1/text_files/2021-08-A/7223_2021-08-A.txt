Footnotes
A BIT OF BOTH was a bit keen inside to the early lead, took pressure from READY FOR CHANGE down the backstretch and into the turn, edged away
from that foe past the three eighths while saving ground, began to draw further clear when pushed along in upper stretch, felt a strike of the crop past the
furlong mark and gradually increased her advantage further while hand ridden the rest of the way. READY FOR CHANGE was keen early to prompt the
pace outside of A BIT OF BOTH, attended outside that foe to the three eighths, was no match from there, but chased on in the three path in the lane to
prove best of the rest. PIECE OF MY HEART broke sharply, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch, was urged in the two path on the turn well
behind the leading pair, offered a brief bid past the five sixteenths, swung into the lane in the four path under a drive, flattened out from upper stretch but
held the show. MARYANORGINGER settled at the rear, trailed in the three path on the turn, was driven inside in the lane and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
RAPID TRANSIT steadied slightly headed into the first turn, raced in the two path from there, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the two and three path, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground steadily on the outside to get up for the win late. ZANDREA'S raced
in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the three and four
path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, improved position in upper stretch, took over with a sixteenth of a mile to go and was caught in the final
strides. SMACK chased the leader from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths
pole, kicked clear entering the stretch, was caught in the final furlong and gave way late. APRIL'S GEM saved ground around the first turn, chased the
leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, raced into mild traffic in upper stretch and was outkicked between horses
from there. CITY FUN saved ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around
the far turn and made no bid. WINDY CITY GIRL led the field while saving ground around the first turn, opened up while racing up the backstretch,
continued to show the way from the rail around the far turn, and tired entering the stretch.

Footnotes
GO LITTLE GERT GO prompted the pace inside of ESTARDO early, tracked that foe into the turn, switched outside that foe, bid in the three path to
reengage her past the three eighths, was outkicked by the pacesetter into upper stretch but kept giving chase with interest, reeled him in past the eighth
pole, took the lead inside the sixteenth and held to the wire. ESTARDO was sent to the lead, took early pressure from GO LITTLE GERT GO to his inside
early, edged clear of that foe while saving ground into the turn, was reengaged from the outside by GO LITTLE GERT GO past the three eighths, inched
clear of that foe again in upper stretch, could not hold him off past the sixteenth but chased on with continued interest to prove second best. LADY
ATLANTIC chased inside down the backstretch, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the turn while positioned inside of TIZ SUSAN ANN, turned for
home two wide behind the leading pair, chased on inside, could not reel in the top pair but kept on evenly to hold show. FLYING BUSINESS broke slightly
inward, settled at the rear, raced in second last in the three path on the turn, was driven into the lane while still racing in the three path, past tiring horses in
upper stretch and took mildly closer order late. TIZ SUSAN ANN chased three wide early, came in on MAJESTIC BLEND near the nine sixteenths, chased
in the three to four path on the turn, floated into the lane in the five path while under a drive, and came up empty. MAJESTIC BLEND chased near the rear
between horses early, took up near the nine sixteenths when TIZ SUSAN ANN came in, dropped back to the rear pair, trailed in the four path on the turn,
floated into the lane in the six path and had no rally.

Footnotes
QUEENS UP raced at the inside of the chasing flight, rallied in the two path past the seven sixteenths, chased SWEET N SASSY in upper stretch, gained
well on that foe from midstretch while under a drive, caught her just past the sixteenth pole and cleared. SWEET N SASSY was bumped by OEUVRE in the
opening strides but appeared unperturbed, advanced to hound outside that foe into the turn, dueled two wide to the five sixteenths, cleared from there,
raced on a clear lead under a drive into the final furlong, was caught by QUEENS UP past the furlong mark and chased on second best. FABULOUS
PHILLY was slow into stride while breaking a bit outward, soon trailed, took closer order past the seven sixteenths while saving ground, was driven inside
into the lane, angled out past the three sixteenths, found his best past the furlong mark, and proved best of the rest. LAURA'S CHARM raced between
horses in the chasing flight early, chased in the four path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, rallied under a drive, kept on but was outkicked narrowly
for the show. WAY OF LIFE was in a little tight early, settled inside at the rear of the main group, bid between horses in the two path on the turn, raced two
wide into the stretch, rallied with continued interest but was outfinished for the show. SUMMER BELLE raced two wide at the rear of the main group early,
continued at the rear of the main group in the two to three path on the turn, raced inside into the lane, made mild improvement in upper stretch, but was
outfinished in the final furlong. OEUVRE broke out and bumped SWEET N SASSY in the opening strides, was sent for pace, was confronted by SWEET N
SASSY into the turn, dueled inside that foe to the five sixteenths, was no match from there, flattened into the lane and was no further threat. FREEDOM
ROSE tracked close to the leading pair early, tracked them in the three to four path on the turn, was outpaced from near the five sixteenths and faded
between horses into the lane. SWOONATRA veered out at the break, raced three wide in the chasing flight on the backstretch, was driven in the five to six
path on the turn and five wide into the lane, and came up empty.

KATIE M'LADY led the field from the two path around first turn, dueled on the inside while racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving
ground around the far turn, dug in gamely in upper stretch and kicked clear in the final furlong. CAT ATTACK saved ground around the first turn, stalked the
frontrunners on the inside up the backstretch, began to move up from the two path around the turn, launched a bid nearing the quarter pole, gained ground
on the winner in upper stretch, could not go with her in the final furlong, and chased that rival home while drifting out mildly late. BEYOND PROPER saved
ground around the first turn, settled in in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, swung out
entering the stretch, causing LILY'S WOOFY to steady, and gained ground while continuing to drift out in the final furlong. LILY'S WOOFY chased the leader
from the three path around the first turn, raced in tight quarters just off the pace through the next quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing in
the three path around the turn, was forced to steady entering the stretch when BEYOND PROPER swung out entering the turn, and finished evenly on the
outside from there. PERFECT DIVA raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack on the inside, saved
ground around the far turn and was outkicked on the rail in the stretch. CHARLO raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside
up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and made no bid. AVASARALA raced outside in the early going, made an early move from
the four path coming off the clubhouse turn, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and faded entering
the stretch. MANHATTAN LEGACY raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back
while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to tire from there. A RIDER OBJECTION AND STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE
CONCERNING THE INCIDENT WITH THE THIRD AND FOURTH PLACED HORSES AT THE TOP OF THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES
WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

range while saving ground around the far turn, angled two wide for a bid in upper stretch, rallied between VALIANT VINNY and RICHIESGOTGAME, led at
the furlong mark, and drove clear. RICHIESGOTGAME broke inward and bumped SIMPLE LOGIC in the opening strides, raced keenly toward the rear into
the clubhouse turn, joined the chasing flight four wide for the backstretch run, bid three wide into the far turn to track in range of the leader while racing
outside of TEMPER TANTRUM, raced three wide in upper stretch, was outkicked by TEMPER TANTRUM to his inside into the final furlong but kept on with
interest to prove second best. VALIANT VINNY broke inward but was nonetheless soon clear to set the pace, continued on a clear lead in the two path on
the far turn, carried that lead into upper stretch, was confronted by TEMPER TANTRUM and RICHIESGOTGAME to his outside midstretch, lost the lead at
the furlong mark, proved no match for his pair of stablemates from there but was never threatened for the show. MKAR THE FAST veered sharply inward in
the opening strides, settled at the inside of the chasing flight, was put in tight between ONE PUTT RICHIE and the rail into the far turn, continued in the
chasing flight inside around the far turn, proved no match for the leading trio into the lane, steadily drifted out down the lane but nonetheless kept on to
prove best of the rest. BEEALEA broke slightly outward and bumped SIMPLE LOGIC in the opening strides, settled near the rear, continued in second last
down the backstretch, raced in the three path with the rear flight around the far turn, was driven inside from upper stretch and passed tiring horses. FLASHY
RICHIE settled at the rear, trailed through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, joined outside of BEEALEA into the far turn, raced in the four path
around that bend, swung seven wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses despite being carried out by ONE PUTT RICHIE. The latter raced between
horses in the chasing flight through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, began to flatten between horses near the three eighths, and drifted out
steadily down the lane without offering a finishing kick. SIMPLE LOGIC was bumped between horses early, chased midfield three wide, continued midpack
in the four path around the far turn, and emptied out three wide from the three sixteenths. KING TITO was sent for pace outside but outsprinted to the lead
by VALIANT VINNY, drifted out past the seven eighths but soon corrected course to track the leader two wide, tracked the pace through the rest of the turn,
down the backstretch and into the far turn, emptied out between horses in the two to three path past the three eighths, and had no more when driven
between in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHUSH raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, began a bid from the three path nearing the
three eighths pole, gained ground on the outside down the lane and pulled clear late. ALL IN A DREAM raced in the three path around the first turn, came
up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, moved up to challenge from the two path headed into the far turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and was caught late. MULSANNE (IRE) angled over to race in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position on the outside in late stretch. MAID OF HONOR saved ground around the first turn, chased
the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, was outkicked in upper stretch and made a late surge between
horses in the final stride. TORN JEANS raced in the two path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, raced
in the two path around the far turn, dueled evenly in upper stretch and weakened late. READY AT MIDNIGHT saved ground around the first turn, trailed the
field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch, and finished evenly, gaining ground mildly
in the final furlong. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued
around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked in late stretch. COLOROFACLOUD raced in the three path around the turn, led the field up the
backstretch, dueled for the lead while saving ground around the far turn and tired in the final furlong. BELLS OF JOY raced into traffic and steadied slightly
while saving ground around the first turn, recovered to run in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the
far turn and was empty from there.
