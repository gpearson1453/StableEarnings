Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SWAP sped to the lead at the start, set the pace near the inside through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, sent clear into the
lane and held safe under a driving finish. DOTHAT DANCE was allowed to settle through early stages, saved ground then tipped out three wide heading into
the lane, responded and roused forward but could not reach the winner. BRIAR JUMPER stalked inside through the backstretch, launched an inside bid at
the head of the lane and churned on for a share. CIRCLE AWAY was reserved through early stages, went four wide into the lane, gained closer contention
but needed more fir serious impact. OBLIO'S WISH stalked two wide through early stages, ridden along around the far turn then gave way in the lane.
WATCHTHEBOURBON tracked the early pace, ridden along two to three wide around the far turn then retreated.

THE CONNECTOR broke on top then settled in behind the pacesetter, remained patiently handled around the far turn, given cue two wide in the upper
stretch, responded and drew clear. BACKWOODS BOOGIE tracked the top two leaders through the backstretch, launched a two wide bid at the quarter
pole, stayed on three wide and gained place. MISSIONATTHESPA set the pace through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, saved ground
into the lane, got collared in the final furlong then got edged out late for place. DONJI settled inside through early stages, ridden along the rail into the lane
then chased on evenly. DIRECT APPROACH raced two wide off the pace, went four wide into the lane and never threatened. BIG DAVE was off awkward
at the start, settled inside and had no response when called upon.

pressure. A GREAT AFFAIR vied briefly then edged back and raced in contention along the inside, slipped through the rail late turn, tipped out a path and
sustained a steady bid for second best. PRINCESS POWER raced off the top flight and chased between around the turn, hustled along four wide into the
lane and stayed on for a share. AINTGOTTACLUE vied two wide between foes, fought back at the head of the lane then flattened out. ONE MORE
FACTOR dueled three wide between foes in early stages then gave way in the lane. CUP MATCH vied for the early lead then weakened nearing the quarter

SUMMER SPLASH set the pace through early stages, vied with GOODLUCKCHUCK around the turn, shook free heading into the lane, cleared on top, dug
in under pressure and held on. GUILLAUME stalked inside through early stages, angled out late on the turn, roused four wide into the lane, responded and
was getting to the winner in final strides. BELLE TAPISSERIE rated through early stages, picked up the pace three wide around the turn, sustained a steady
bid and raced along for show. GOODLUCKCHUCK vied inside of the winner around the turn then gave way in the lane. GOSPEL WAY settled through early
stages, went three wide around the turn and failed to move on. HELLO HELLO MISTER tracked the pace through early stages and had no response when
called upon around the turn. IL FARAONE lacked speed and saved ground to no avail.
