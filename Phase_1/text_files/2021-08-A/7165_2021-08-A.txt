KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down
the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of his pace rival entering the lane, and inched clear late. STAY ALL NIGHT away alertly and tracked
the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, trailed the field into the final turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed
determinedly from along the rail in deep stretch to get up for the place in the closing strides. PARKER POINT broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the
outside of KLONDIKE GENTLEMAN entering the backstretch, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, was unable
to keep tabs on his pace rival entering the lane, and just failed to hold the place. BRANDON'S LEGACY settled at the back of the pack while racing one out
from the rail entering the first turn, rushed up three wide soon after entering the backside, collared the leaders while racing two out from the rail entering the
final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the late stages.

DEFINITE PLEASURE broke sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run down the
backside, held a long lead into the final turn, and was never seriously threatened late while being ridden out late. KANDY KATIE unhurried early while
dropping back to trail, advanced one out from the rail midway down the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, was never a threat to the winner,
but proved clearly second best. PINEAPPLE TIDBITS away well and stalked the leader from along the rail entering the first turn, maintained her position in
the run down the backside, steadied briefly when put in tight quarters at the rail entering the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished one out
from the rail in the drive in an even effort. DON'T TESS ME settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three
wide through the final turn, but needed more of a closing response when called upon. LITTLE BLACK DRESS away alertly and chased the leader into the
first turn before settling into a tracking trip one out from the rail, maintained her position to the final turn, before weakening.

CALAMAZEUS away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the
final turn, continued to save ground through the final turn, and held ATOMIC HAZE safely at bay late to prevail. ATOMIC HAZE away well and stalked the
leader into the first turn while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove easily
second best. JUVEE TOO stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished
three wide in the drive to prove best of the rest. KEEPINGTHEDREAM settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the the
backstretch at the back of a compact field, rallied two wide between rivals through the final urn, and finished from along the inside in the drive. HARVEST
DAY was slow into stride, then rushed up from along the rail and was forced to steady off heels entering the first turn, held a tracking trip from along the
inside in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, steadied sharply when in tight quarters midway through the turn, and had
nothing to offer thereafter. COMMANDER B broke sharply and tracked the leader three wide entering the backstretch, held a striking trip in the run to the
final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's claim of foul. the rider of HARVEST MOON lodged a
claim of foul against the rider of KEEPINGTHEDREAM for alleged interference midway through the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed,
and no change was made to the original order of finish

TOBELUCKY AGAIN away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position
in the run down the backstretch, tipped three wide to commence his bid entering the final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and was all out to fend
of a late charge by BETATHANABOTFRIEND to prevail. BETATHANABOYFRIEND unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied three wide entering
the final turn, and closed with a rush three out from the rail in the drive to just miss. ACE DEUCE broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of
WICKED FORTITUDE through the stretch the first time, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken
entering the lane, and finished two wide in the drive to hold on for a share. HIGHWAY BOSS tracked the dueling leaders through the stretch the first time
while saving ground at the rail, maintained his position in the run to the final turn, rallied along the inside while awaiting room through the turn, tipped three
wide entering the lane, and finished evenly. WICKED FORTITUDE away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, but faded in the stretch drive. CRAZY PROPHET settled off
the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the lane the first time, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon.
