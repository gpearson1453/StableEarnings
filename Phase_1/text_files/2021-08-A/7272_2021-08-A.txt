ACT OF BOB showed speed from the inside and set the pace, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for
the win. HARD N'SWEET was hustled early, roused on the turn and was second best in a good effort. MONEY MATTERS stalked the early leader, was a
factor on the turn and had a bid from the four path in mid stretch but was outfinished. ROBUSTO was well back and saved ground on the turn but had no
impact. BORN TO BE KING was unhurried early and showed little in a dull effort.

ONE STAR GIRL tracked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and with the lead from the three path in mid stretch held sway. DELIGHTFUL
DREAMER was unhurried early and gained ground on the far turn but from the five path through the stretch was no match for the winner. MACHISIMA was
hustled early, had a clear lead on the far turn but was headed in mid stretch and was outgunned. SEAQUELLE was off the pace and had a mild gain on the
far turn but was no real threat. HIDEY HIDEY was away alertly and roused from the inside on the far turn but had no response. DONT WAKE THE BEAR
was in touch but chased on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch failed to fire. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON MACHISIMA
AGAINST ONE STAR GIRL FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MID STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

READY AT DAWN set the pace, took command on the far turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. TURKISH TIME was in range, raced
evenly on the far turn and was no match for the winner. CALMING INFLUENCE tracked the early leader, a factor on the far turn and was the best of the
rest. SETSON was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. JMR AWESOM SILENCE was in touch but chased
on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. HEEHAA had no speed and roused from between foes on the far turn but from the
six path at the top of the stretch had no response. FORGED BY FIRE was away alertly and hustled along on the far turn but from the eight path at the top of
the stretch had no rally. SLIGO CALLING was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn while outrun.

on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. MARRIAGE COUNSELOR was in range and roused on the turn but needed
more. MR CHANGUE was in touch and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact. BIG TIME LOUIE lost his

DYNAMIC FORCE settled off the early pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch drew clear. WATER POLO forced the
pace, was a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was second best in a good effort. EXECUTIVE RETREAT showed speed
from the inside and had the lead on the turn but gave way in mid stretch. TOBRUK had no speed, saved ground on the turn and angled out through the
stretch to get up for a share. OPTIC stumbled at the start and raced evenly on the turn but had no kick. ZOOMER MUSIC was in mid pack and hustled
along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. SUMMER RETREAT was up close but chased on the turn and from the four path
at the top of the stretch was empty. FRONT NINE was off the pace and showed nothing in a dull effort.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR SILENCE was in touch, a factor on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. WHAT'S IN A KISS
(IRE) was off the pace, saved ground on the far turn and rallied late but just missed. WILBURNRUBBER was in range, moved up on the far turn and from
the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. PRINCESS MORO was well back, trailed the field on the far turn and passed tired foes through the
stretch. PRESSURE FRONT had no speed and raced evenly on the far turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch needed more. GOSUDARINA
was in mid pack and had a good position on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. LILIBET was up close and had a slim lead
on the far turn but gave way late. STORMY SUZIE set a pressured pace and dueled on the far turn but had nothing left. KLASSY DELIGHT forced the early
pace but lost ground on the far turn and was empty.
