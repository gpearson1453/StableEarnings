Footnotes
SECRET SQUARE broke out and brushed rival at the start, dueled from inside before inching ahead into the backstretch, put away PAIGE RUNNER at the
five-sixteenths then met the challenge from SHERILINDA nearing the quarter pole, responded well and shook free into the stretch, then widened through the
final furlong. SHERILINDA stalked the top pair from outside, bid alongside SECRET SQUARE past the five-sixteenths pole, could not sustain the
momentum leaving the turn and chased the winner to the wire. MONGOLIAN WINDOW was put in tight and checked between early, angled to the inside,
came out on the far turn and was along for the show. PAIGE RUNNER dueled from outside on the first turn then pressed up the backstretch, lost contact
past the five-sixteenths and weakened in the lane. REDS SACRED APPEAL got floated out nearing the first turn, tracked off the the pace off the rail, came
three wide into the drive and improved position. PROMNESIA tracked the speed in the two path, angled to the rail on the far turn, saved ground to the
stretch and could not rally. RED NOVA became fractious in the gate, got brushed from inside at the start, was hard to ride entering the first turn, trailed well
off the rail to the second bend, came six wide into the stretch and was never a factor. SMILING ANN bobbled leaving the gate, tracked off the inside,
entered the stretch five wide and had little left.

Footnotes
VIKING PLUNDER reserved early from inside, tugged closer up the backstretch then went between runner, got bumped and put in tight quarters at the
seven-sixteenths pole, angled five wide around the second bend, rallied outside the top pair and drew alongside mid-stretch, dueled with TOM'S SURPRISE
in deep stretch and got up. TOM'S SURPRISE pulled early on the first turn, stalked the top pair from inside, checked hard at the three-eighths, remained
inside then tipped out into the stretch, struck the front inside the eighth pole, fought with the winner to the wire but was edged on the line. MOUNTAIN
SPIRIT brushed from outside leaving the gate, exchanged bumps with that same rival to the first turn, dueled for the lead from inside, cleared at the
five-sixteenths, challenged from outside with a furlong remaining and yielded to the top pair. RESPECT THE HUSTLE steadied off heels early on the first
turn, tracked off the rail to the far turn, advanced four wide around that bend but faltered in the stretch. INDY JONES settled off the rail, advanced outside
rivals on the backstretch, bumped inner rival at the seven-sixteenths, chased three wide into the drive and could produce a bid. BIG BAD GARY broke in
and brushed rival, exchanged bumps with same rival to the first turn, went up to duel for the lead from outside, could not keep pace midway around the far
turn and weakened. MAHI MAHI ceded the lead to the top pair early, chased outside a rival then between foes, got knocked into inner rival at the
seven-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch and lacked further response. MEADWAY dropped back soon after the start and never got inovled.

LISETTE chased off the inside then went up to apply pressure on the backstretch, launched a bid at the five-sixteenths, took over into the stretch, put away
PARK AVENUE at the eighth pole and inched away. PARK AVENUE bobbled and brushed with inside rival at the start, sped to the front and set the pace,
challenged at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command into the stretch and stayed on to hold secure the place. ASSIGNATION broke out, stalked off the rail,
chased within range three wide leaving the far turn but faltered in the lane. OPTIMAS stalked along the inside, coaxed near the halfway point, came under a
ride on the far turn, angled off the inside in upper stretch and weakened. FLIPPING FAST stumbled leaving the gate, traveled four to five wide on both turns
and failed to threatened. ANGEL OF FREEDOM got floated out into the first turn then pulled while racing off heels and steered out four wide, remained off
the rail into the stretch, came in a bit at the top of the lane and weakened. ESAGERARE brushed with outside rival at the start, drifted out into the first turn,
chased two wide to the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
T BONES TRICK settled on the inside, came out leaving the far turn and into the stretch, closed through the lane and drew alongside with a sixteenth
remaining and proved best late. PRESS BRIEFING was closest in pursuit early, closed in past the three-eighths, bid inside at the five-sixteenths pole, fought
with rivals leaving the turn, cleared in upper stretch then yielded grudgingly to the winner. JAN'S RESERVE off slow to begin, angled out on the far turn and
came six wide into the stretch, closed widest in the drive and whittle the gap late. KENZOU'S RHYTHM went five wide around the first turn, bid four deep at
the five-sixteenths, drifted five wide into the stretch and flattened out. HOUSE LIMIT bumped both sides leaving the gate, chased outside a rival early,
moved closer leaving the backstretch, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths, fought with PRESS BRIEFING into the stretch and flattened out. SATANTA sat
off the pace early on, went between foes on the backstretch, angled around rival past the five-sixteenths, steered in upper stretch and could not rally. SAYIN
GRACE got bumped leaving the gate, traveled three deep on the backstretch, four wide into the drive and lacked further response. WHATSITTOYA showed
keen early foot and opened up a comfortable advantage, remained clear into the far turn, got swallowed up at the five-sixteenths, tired in the lane and eased
across the wire. TYPHOON HARRY broke out and bumped rival at the start, traveled well off the pace, came up empty in the late stages eased down the
lane and walked off.

BOSSY SOUL closest in pursuit in the early going, drew alongside at the three-sixteenths, gained the lead in upper stretch and drew away. NAUGHTY
EVELYN sped clear and controlled the pace in the early stages, challenged into the drive, overtaken in upper stretch and held the place. BANDEENA went
five wide into the first turn, remained off the rail, three wide into the stretch and kept on to earn the show honors. CONSIDER ME GONE traveled in
mid-pack, went between foes into the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. PORTUGUESEPRINCESS went four wide through
the first turn, four to five wide on the second bend and also lacked a rally. DUAL REALITY got pinballed at the start, angled six wide on the far turn and
moved up in the stretch. VANNA bobbled and bumped leaving the gate, raced off the rail then angled to the inside, moved closer up the backstretch but
weakened in the late stages. MAMMA RAMA bumped repeatedly from outside at the start, pulled and drifted out some around the clubhouse turn, started to
weaken around the second bend, eased in the lane and walked off. BRIO IS AWESOME stumbled at the start, traveled four wide around both turns, had
nothing left for the stretch and was eased to the wire and walked off. MOREAVINO raced off the pace in the early going, sustained an injury past the
five-sixteenths and was pulled up shortly after, then walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
KLEEN KARMA stalked the pace from inside, tipped out into the stretch, rallied to the front in the final sixteenth, drifted out late and prevailed. BIG CLARE
got bumped at the start, settled off the pace, traveled along the inside then a bit off the rail into the drive, split foes in the final sixteenth and missed. KEEP
DANCING unhurried at the back, moved into the two path on the far turn, drifted out and brushed rival mid-stretch, rallied alongside the leader and was
bothered by that foe drifting out late and kept on gamely to the wire. BELLA D broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack through the
early stages, went four wide into the drive, drifted in and brushed rival in upper stretch, got brushed by KEEP DANCING in mid-stretch, and kept to task in
the final sixteenth while getting bothered by the winner late. WARRIOR'S MOON up close early on the inside, tipped out on the far turn, remained off the rail
in the stretch and finished willingly while failing to find the needed late kick. NICE ICE broke alertly to gain control, set the pace clear of the field, remained
unchallenged into the lane but weakened in deep stretch. BIG MAMA SUE came away to an awkward beginning, raced well off the pace, stayed inside to
the stretch but lacked room near the fence through the lane. SUNSHINE BABE traveled two wide then moved out three wide while in range but lacked the
needed response when called upon. SWING THOUGHTS stalked in the two path, chased three to four wide into the drive and faded. PAWNEE traveled
near the back of the pack outside a rival, a bit off the rail into the stretch and was never a factor. THERE WERE TWO INQUIRIES INTO THE RUNNING OF
RACE SIX. FIRST THE STEWARDS REVIEW THE INCIDENT BETWEEN KEEP DANCING AND BELLA D IN MID-STRETCH AND RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH KEEP DANCING DID COME OUT AND MAKE SLIGHT CONTACT WITH BELLA D, THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A
DISQUALIFICATION. THE STEWARDS THEN LOOKED AT THE INCIDENT BETWEEN KLEEN KARMA, KEEP DANCING, AND BELLA D LATE IN THE
RACE AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH KELEEN KARM DID COME OUT AND BOTHER KEEP DANCING AND BELLA D LATE, IT DID NOT AFFECT
THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
AT THE SPA ran up on heels and steadied at the seven-sixteenths pole, waited for room along the inside through the turn, slipped through inside and
brushed rival in upper stretch, fought with DRIZELLA in the final furlong and edged the runner-up. DRIZELLA got forced out leaving the gate, bothered by
IT'S SIMPLE who steadied and shifted out early, bid three deep with a quarter mile remaining, gained command in upper stretch, dueled with AT THE SPA
in the final furlong and yielded grudgingly. MADIHA traveled in mid-pack early on, angled off the rail and came four wide into the stretch, closed outside the
top pair in the late stages but was not enough. IRISH WAHINE came away slow and got bumped at the start, trailed early, went four wide into the turn, six
wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally but made no impact on the top trio. CARMEN MIRANDA broke out and bumped rival at the start, chased
outside rivals then four to five wide around the turn and lacked a rally. IT'S SIMPLE showed early speed then steadied behind the leader and switched to the
outside, drew alongside leaving the back, vied between past the quarter pole and flattened out. LION'S LAIR chased between rivals, traveled three to four
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. KO OLINA broke out and bobbled while still coming away quickest, set the pace outside a rival then cleared and
angled over to the two path, vied with a pair of rivals a bit off the rail leaving the turn, relinquished the lead and brushed with the winner in upper stretch,
then weakened in the late stages. GIANNA'S WILD CAT traveled two wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ALGERIA (IRE) tracked just out of range on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, steered out at the top of the lane, struck the front inside the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. TIZ TACT TOE got bumped and squeezed back early, stalked the pace outside a rival, went three wide into the far turn, took aim two
wide entering the stretch, bid alongside in the final furlong may have led briefly mid-stretch but got outkicked by the winner. BENDER got bumped leaving
the gate, stalked on the inside, tipped out mid-stretch and finished willingly for the show honors. CIRCUMVENT set the pace under pressure from outside,
moved clear at the five-sixteenths, gained a challenger mid-stretch and weakened in the late stages. FIRE POLISH chased off the inside then outside a rival
on the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide and never launched a bid. AMERICAN GREAT broke in and bumped rival at the start, pulled around the
first turn, tracked inside then waited for an opening leaving the second bend, gained a clear path in the lane but needed to find more late. GOT CURLY
raced three wide around the first turn, went outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, exited the far turn four wide and and could not rally. BORKAN angled
down to the two path early, traveled three deep on the backstretch, angled five wide into the lane and failed to menace. MY INDY was unhurried in the early
going from inside, came out on the far turn and entered the stretch five to six wide and failed to rally. WINZER tucked inside from off the pace then went
outside a rival, came under a ride on the far turn but weakened in the lane. CANT STOP THIS MAN came in and bumped rival soon after the start, went up
to prompt the pace from outside, applied pressure to the five-sixteenths pole then could not keep up with the leader and faded through the lane.
