INFINITE PATIENCE away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue from the outside of
HEIDI in the run to the final turn, assumed command under confident handling entering the final turn, and quickly drew clear through the final furlong without
any encouragement. HEIDI raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, and through the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along
the rail in the run to the final turn, was no match for the winner entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive to prove easily second
best. MI REYNA stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, began to lose touch with her pace rivals in the run
down the backstretch, raced three wide through the final furlong without the needed closing response.

BOLD ARCH away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the second turn and
in the run down the backstretch, turned back a mild challenge from AT ATTENTION entering the final turn, and drew clear through the final furlong under
confident handling. AT ATTENTION broke sharply and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, shifted just off the
rail for the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, was unable to threaten the winner over the final furlong, but finished willingly to
prove clearly second best. PAY MY WAY settled at the back of the field while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, advanced midway down the
backstretch to gain a striking position entering the final turn, rallied along the inside through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. GUNS N
AMMO tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the pacesetter two wide into the
backstretch, struggled to hold his position in the run to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

TEXAS HUMOR away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and through

turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was unable to match strides with TEXAS HUMOR entering the
lane, and finished three wide in the drive to hold the place. VALUE MAX was off a step slow, and pinched between rivals to trail the field into the first turn,
commenced his bid from along the inside approaching the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. SILVER
ARROW away well and stalked the dueling leader one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, swung

BOUNDARY BAY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, battled from the inside of YOU DON'T OWN ME leaving the turn, and prevailed over that determined foe following a stretch long battle. YOU
DON'T OWN ME tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied smartly three wide entering the final turn, battled for the
lead into the stretch, and finished three wide in the drive to just miss. PADDY D'ORO tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail,
rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive in a solid effort. TIZ MEOW settled at the back of the back
while racing three wide entering the backstretch, advanced four wide midway down the backside, rallied four wide through the final turn, and finished five
wide in the drive. SANAWAR away alertly and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, lacked room entering the lane, and finished with late interest two wide in deep stretch. QUAGMIRE away
well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, but was
outfinished in the drive.
