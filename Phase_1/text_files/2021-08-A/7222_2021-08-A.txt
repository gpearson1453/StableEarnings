Footnotes
ENDORPHIN RUSH stalked the pace, lapped on the leader on the far turn, led midway through the turn then held off UMNEYAAT through the stretch.
UMNEYAAT broke outward, stalked the pace, forced the issue on the turn, bid upper stretch, was determined, but hung. SKY OF DREAMS settled off the
pace, closed late backstretch, was hustled from the rail on the turn and gained steadily through the stretch. TRANQUIL SKY raced off the pace, rode the rail
on the turns, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. CARELESS HEIRESS raced in mid pack, closed into the far turn, angled from the rail to three-wide
then finished evenly. OUT OF ROMANCE settled in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then evened out late. SILENT AND SMART
broke outward and settled off the pace, was hustled three to five-wide through the far turn but never reached contention. VICTORIAVILLE led early, set a
pressured pace, was headed mid turn, chased to the stretch and tired. TWOCANKEEPASECRET raced in mid pack, dropped back late backstretch and
lacked a rally. SNOW SQUALL stalked the pace, faded between foes on the far turn and showed no closing response. SUSPICIOUS MINDS raced in mid
pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
SELF INFLICTED sat in mid pack and two wide on the first turn, advanced into contention three wide at the quarter pole, joined the leaders outside in
midstretch and got a short lead at the sixteenth pole, holding a head advantage in the final yards. SECRET PATH was last into the first turn, the rider
sensing a soft pace circled up to take command in early backstretch, had a clear margin into the far turn, challenged and headed by a rival turning for home
but fought that one off before succumbing to the winner in the final sixteenth, battling on gamely to the wire. QUANTUM VELOCITY stalked the early leader
on the first turn, was hard held to sit off when a rival went around to take the front early on the backstretch, bid for the front midway on the far turn and had a
brief lead turning for home, outkicked by the top two finishers when between them in late stretch, holding the show. POLYDEUCES led into the first turn,
taken back to allow a rival the front in early backstretch, along the rail in behind two foes and inside the eventual winner until turning for home, but could not
match the top trio's gameness in the final stages. DADDYPLAYSTHEBLUES off the pace and three wide on the first turn, asked to rally on the far turn but
had no response. KNOTTY BY DESIGN chased along the rail, stayed inside throughout and never in contention. SHAKOO MAKOO off the pace, rallied
mildly on the far turn when two to three wide and drifted out in the stretch without threatening.

RACE FOR PINKS stalked the pace, closed four then three-wide through the turn, led into the stretch and held sway under a drive. EXECUTIVE HOLIDAY
bumped with LIVERPOOL MAN at the start, settled in range, was hustled three-wide late turn and finished under a determined drive. LIVERPOOL MAN,
bumped at the outset, raced from off the pace, came two and three-wide on the turn then rallied full of run through the stretch but was too late to menace.
WHIZMO was herded outward leaving the gate, forced the pace, dueled, was headed late turn and chased through the stretch. SALTY CANDY broke
outward, set a pressured pace, backed away late turn and lacked a further response. COUSIN ROB raced in mid pack, was hustled angling from the rail to
three-wide on the turn but never reached contention. MR SOUPERSTITIOUS, steadied at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail on the turn
but lacked a closing response. HIT THIS TOWN raced in mid pack, closed four-wide on the turn, stalked into the stretch but tired a furlong out.

Footnotes
LONGANDSHORTOFIT raced in mid pack, was hustled from the second path and the rail on the turn, was bumping with SON OF MY FATHER in the
stretch, shrugged it off, dug in and got up in time under a drive. VIRREINATO broke outward, forced the pace, bid at the 1/4 pole, was headed upper stretch,
rallied gamely looking for a second battle and just missed. BULLET SPEED set a pressured pace, was joined late turn, led upper stretch, almost lasted but
was caught on the wire. SON OF MY FATHER had the early lead but was headed early on the backstretch, forced the pace, stalked two and three-wide on
the turn, launched his rally in the gridlocked upper stretch, bumped with CARDIFF HALL and SON OF MY FATHER, was brave and finished gamely.
CARDIFF HALL broke slowly and settled at the back of the pack, closed angling from two to four-wide on the turn, was involved in the bumping in the
stretch but chased to the end. SWEET LITTLE ARTIE raced in mid pack, came two-wide through the turn then raced evenly to the end. MAGIC MOUNTAIN
was herded outward leaving the gate, pressed the pace, bid four-wide at the 1/4 pole, lost ground at the top of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SAMUEL H moved up early to force the pace, challenged at the top of the stretch, dueled to the end and prevailed under a drive. ORPHAN HALLIE led into
the first turn, set a pressured pace, was engaged at the top of the stretch, battled to the wire but was outfinished. I HAVE HOPE stalked the pace, raced
three and four-wide on both turns, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. DR. JEWEL bobbled leaving the gate and was steadied, settled in range,
chased two and three-wide on the far turn, was steadied mid rally behind a rival a furlong out and finished gamely to no avail. L'ETAT (GER) stalked the
pace from the rail, chased into the stretch and finished willingly. NO EXIT settled in mid pack, was hustled four-wide on the far turn but never reached
contention. STRONG ATTITUDE stalked the pace two-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. PATERNOSTER
rated in mid pack, rode the rail on both turns, was hustled into the stretch and finished with some interest. JR BOURBON settled in mid pack, came
three-wide through the clubhouse turn, moved to the rail for the far turn where he was roused several times but had no response and showed little in the
stretch. MIRACULOUS BREW hit the gate leaving and settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide and from the rail on the final turn but lacked a closing
response. WENJACK settled well off the pace and trailed throughout.
