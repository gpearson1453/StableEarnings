Footnotes
NURSE SADIE settled early inside, gradually progressed to take over the lead on the second turn, floated out some entering the stretch and steadily
widened command under a mild drive. LADY DI was sent to a clear lead at the start, drifted out badly leaving the first bend, gradually made her way back
toward the inside on the backstretch, bore out leaving the second turn, was under a steady drive through the lane and proved easily second best. CREAL
ANGEL hesitated, broke outward and responded awkwardly to her correction, was settled inside, commenced her bid on the second bend and drew off for
second inside the last furlong. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN raced in contention from path two for six furlongs, stayed outside NURSE SADIE into the stretch, was
also no match for that one and gave way the final eighth. LORI ATTACK steadily faded from path three.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SUCCESS rated along the rail through the early going, was roused on the second turn, took the lead leaving that bend, moved clear upper
stretch and kept DAVKA at bay under steady handling. DAVKA pressed the early pace from between rivals, threatened three wide on he second turn,
fanned out some for the stretch run, was all out, came up short but pulled clear for second. MR. LUV MAKER was sent to a clear early lead, showed the
way just off the inside, was overtaken from inside leaving the second bend and slowly yielded between horses in the lane. TOCCETIVE JAC was settled
inside, gradually progressed along the rail to have a striking position with two furlongs to go but could only make up minor ground through the stretch. JOEY
B raced in contention from outside for more than six furlongs then flattened out for the drive.

SYMBOLIST was bumped solidly, forced into AWINBENEATMYWINGS then bumped solidly again with TEARS ON A RIVER at the break, quickly
recovered, was rated just outside the latter, took the lead when asked on the second bend then steadily drew away under a drive through the stretch.
EUGENE settled at the back and inside, picked up his pace after a half mile, split horses two wide on the second turn, swung toward the outside for the
stretch run and caught TRAVEL ACCOUNT for second near the wire. TRAVEL ACCOUNT rated from outside, also commenced his bid after a half mile,
came into contention four wide on the second bend, angled in some for the drive, moved ahead for second upper stretch, did not have enough left in the
waning yards but was easily best of the others. TEARS ON A RIVER bumped twice with SYMBOLIST at the start, was hustled up to a clear early lead,
showed the way from inside, did not stay with the latter on the second turn and flattened out through the lane. WAVE THE GOLD chased from paths three to
five and had no late bid. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS bumped at the break, raced in the second flight from outside, did not keep up into the second bend,
moved to the rail and steadily gave way.

STORMY EMPIRE a step slow at the start, soon advanced inside to vie for the lead after the first furlong, moved clear when allowed on the turn, responded
to hand urging upper stretch to drew off then lengthened command under a drive the last eighth. HOLD THE SPENDING broke alertly, was challenged from
inside after a furlong, put to a drive on the bend, battled through the stretch and lasted for the place. MY WIFE IS BOSS gradually angled in on the
backstretch, moved clear for third three wide on the turn, fought gamely for second in the lane, did not have enough late but was easily best of the rest. MIZ
CLIPPER chased while toward the outside on the backstretch, took the rail on the bend and had no stretch bid. SING KITTY SING bumped with I JUANA
HERO at the break, trailed, moved to the inside nearing the turn and was empty for the drive. I JUANA HERO gave way nearing the end of three furlongs,
was pulled up in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE soon shared the lead between horses, moved clear and stayed just off the inside on the backstretch, was roused with two furlongs
to go and drew away from the others under urging the final furlong. TWO BIT KID vied for the early lead from inside, did not stay with KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE on the backstretch, was roused on the second bend, took over second into the lane, was no match for the latter the last eighth but easily
second best. TETSU progressed between horses on the backstretch to take second with a half mile left, angled outside KHOZAN'S VALENTINE to loom a
threat approaching the end of six furlongs but gave way for the stretch run. STALLONE was prominent early from outside, began to fade before finishing five
furlongs, distanced himself from the rest through the stretch and was walked off after the race.

Footnotes
GO FOR SHERRIE was hustled from the gate to stay close to the early pacesetter, went for the lead two wide on the second turn, edged ahead under hand
urging upper stretch then drew clear under a drive the last furlong. WILD FOX broke on top and was sent to a clear lead, rated from inside on the
backstretch, roused when challenged on the second bend, could not stay with GO FOR SHERRIE in the lane but kept second under urging. SHELL FIRE
bumped with SARACEN at the start, advanced to contention from just off the inside on the backstretch, did not keep up after a half mile, steadily angled out
taking the second turn, lost ground staying outside D'ARCHER entering the lane, showed a willingness to run the final furlong and drew away for third late.
D'ARCHER was urged up from outside to be a contender on the backstretch, threatened from path three on the second bend, drifted out some into the
stretch and began to flatten. MIAS MOONBEAM advanced to contention from between horses on the backstretch, moved to the rail midway on the second
turn and began to yield before finishing six furlongs. ANDREW THE GIANT also bumped with SARACEN at the break, chased from inside, swung out for a
better path with two furlongs left but had no late bid. SARACEN pinched briefly between horses at the start, progressed to be factor from outside on the
backstretch but gave way with three furlongs to go.
