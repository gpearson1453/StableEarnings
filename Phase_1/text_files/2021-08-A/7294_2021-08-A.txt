KITTY EXPRESS always within striking distance while along the rail, was boxed in on the far turn, shifted out splitting rivals two wide nearing the top of the
stretch, closed with a rush in the five path and was along in time. ALL AMERICAN JEWEL made the lead two wide after a quarter, set the balance of the
pace, widened into the stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. MISS IRISH BOSS trailed early, moved up quickly three wide into the far
turn then failed to sustain that bid. POPPY'S GIRL had her head turned at the start, vied for the lead into the second turn then gave way. TIZ THIRSTY was
no factor. TIKA set the pace along the inside through the first turn, kept pressure into the second turn then stopped.
