Footnotes
BELLEHAVEN rail speed throughout, well rated to the stretch, all out lasted. PASSO A FRENTE never far back throughout, coming on from the quarter pole
late. FIST FULL OF DICE unhurried to far turn, rallied in stretch to close the gap late. WENDY'S FINE WINE pressed pace to far turn, weakened in the
stretch run. TELLER TO SING outside trip throughout, nothing left in the stretch run. BIRRA roughed up in the stretch the first time and going into first turn,
made a middle move to far turn in good position but gave way from that point. CLASSIC TALE SAVER through early, dropped back. EKATI EMPRESS no
factor. LEMONY SASS steadily faded. QUICK DIAL no factor.

Footnotes
MORO MAGIC chased leader to stretch, carried out in the drive, up in time. FIOR DI LATTE sprinted clear at once, led to the stretch, drifted out stretch. LA
TAPATIA chased to pair throughout while mildly in the final furlong. EGALITE off tardy from the gate, far back to stretch with a late surge too late. C V
THUNDER raced evenly to the stretch, cut the margin in the final furlong. SPITZ unhurried to the turn, cut into margin while no real threat. CHLOE RENE
ran into trouble on the turn from inside, angled out and cut into margin in the drive. TALK DIRTY failed to menace after being steadied into turn. GET
CLEAR never menaced. WHAT'S HER FACE through early, dropped back.
