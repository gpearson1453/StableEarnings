SONG OF INDY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside the leader, then made a steady gain and drove clear late. SOPHIE'S
ANGEL allowed to settle, angled out through the turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady gain and closed the gap on the winner. SHALL RETURN
well placed and outside, held position two and three wide through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and evened out. YES IT'S ERIE allowed to settle,
moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and got up for a share. GENEVIEVE'S Z VA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the
start, stayed on when challenged through the turn, shook clear, then weakened late. THE TWO NANCY'S stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of
that one into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
THEYKEEPONCOMIN well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and
drove clear late. SENORITA SPARKPLUG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, shook clear
inside the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. SECRET TEMPLE allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the
second turn, bid four wide into the stretch, closed willingly and missed the place. LACEE well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the
second turn, bid on that path and weakened in the stretch. ANNIE UP BUCK never far back, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, then
had no stretch rally. MONSOON RAIN rated close up and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into the
stretch and faded the final furlong. CASPIAN TALE lunged at the start and was no factor.

BATTLE CHARGE mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room,
made a steady gain and drove clear. WONDERSTRUCK broke sharply from the gate gaining a clear lead early, saved ground inside the leader through the
turn, bid three wide into the stretch, then closed well late to gain the place. ALI ALLEY eased to the lead, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook
clear, then was no match for the winner and held the show. SHESASCOLDASICE allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path
into the lane and missed the show. SWEET DUTCHESS well placed, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane
and weakened the final furlong. RUNAWAY BREEZE was no factor. DONYA KNOW IT well placed, gained a striking position on the two path through the
turn, bid between rivals into the stretch and had no rally.
