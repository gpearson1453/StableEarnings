Footnotes
DEL MAR SUMMER attended the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, took a narrow lead at the head of the lane, was kept busy to the wire and
held from STORMIN FAST, who moved forward inside to press, went on or just off the rail on the turn, stayed on late under urging to narrowly miss.
CERVEZA was urged strongly at the break, contended from between runners two to three wide on the turn, was outkicked late. COURAGE N ORDER
settled in the back group, went between rivals six deep into the turn, ran on mildly in the lane. HOLD ME ONLY broke outwardly and was devoid of early
speed, went seven wide on the turn and ran evenly. NO PASA NADA switched out at the half-mile marker, went in the five path on the turn, failed to rally.
GUNNERS ONE was forwardly-positioned between runners three wide into the turn, appeared done early on that bend, dropped back and faded.

BORTSTEIN settled off the leaders, moved in to go two then three wide on the turn, came out six wide turning into upper stretch, took aim and drove past in
late stretch. ALMOST A STORM vied inside rivals but off the fence in the two path, edged clear turning for home, led late but was outkicked. BLUE BOY
WHO settled mid-pack, advanced inside leaving the turn but evened out. DAJUDGE settled last but one racing off the inside, went three to four wide on the
turn, passed tired rivals in the stretch. WILLY TELL HIM contested the pace from outside, lost ground entering the turn going four wide on that bend before
reapplying pressure briefly near the quarter pole, weakened thereafter. AUSSIE YOU LATER vied from between runners, dropped back three wide on the
turn and came up empty. A CEE DOO CEE was completely devoid of speed racing off the inside and was never a threat.

MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T broke in just a bit the moved forward tracking the leaders, bid inside early on the turn, was clear turning for home and drew away
under steady handling. CAUGHT STEALING settled in behind the leaders off the inside, went three then four wide on the turn put to a drive late on that
bend, was no match for the winner but second best. SEVENTH HENNESSY contended between runners early, dropped back four then three wide on the
turn, kept on for show honors. TEXANA vied inside runners early then two to three wide on the turn before weakening. SPECIAL PRIDE was outpaced
early, moved in six then five wide on the turn and ran on evenly. OUR ISLAND GIRL was outside a foe early, dropped back and shifted in entering the turn,
saved ground on the rail before coming out in upper stretch but had no rally. MY INSTIGATOR showed brief speed from outside but soon dropped back
going five then four wide on the turn, faded in the lane.

CATCH TEN settled outside off the leaders, advanced four to five wide on the turn taking the lead a furlong from home, drew away under steady handling.
SONG OF LAURA stalked the dueling leaders early, went three to four wide on the turn, was no match but second best. E BAR GOLD dueled inside a rival
up the backstretch, lost ground on that one and switched out early on the turn going mostly three wide on that bend, evened out in drive. MIGHTY OAKS
MAGIC dueled outside a foe, edged clear two wide early on the turn, came up empty. DIABOLICAL KING shifted in heading up the backstretch, rode the rail
on the turn and failed to rally. REBACK HOME was not a factor racing in the two path.
