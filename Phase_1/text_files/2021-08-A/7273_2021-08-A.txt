GROOVY GIRL away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, collared the leaders three wide entering the final
turn, assumed control entering the lane, and inched clear late under confident handling. GET BAKK broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside, battled for the lead from along the rail entering the final turn, was unable to match
strides with GROOVY GIRL in the lane, but finished well to prove clearly second best. ANAAMY away well and tracked the leader one out from the rail
entering the backstretch, rallied two wide from between rivals entering the final turn, steadied slightly entering the lane, but was no match for the top pair,
while proving best of the rest. SILVER ARROW settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through
the final turn, but needed more when called upon. HARBOUR STORM unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced out from the rail in the run down
the backside, and failed to make a late impact.

VANCOUVER'S HUNTER broke sharply and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the
final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane while overhauling the pacesetters and drew clear late under confident handling. CAROLINA GENT away well
and vied for the lead from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside and through
the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and while no match for the winner, battled gamely to hold the place. ITSMYDAY settled well off the contested
early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished with good late interest one out from
the rail in deep stretch to just miss the place. MONTE away alertly and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two
wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, drifted out in deep stretch under left handed urging, and
the rider dropped his whip. QUALITY COMMAND settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide
entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon.

KHAIKY'S COMMAND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch,
held a clear advantage through the final turn, and held THE CHANCES R safely at bay to prevail. THE CHANCES R away well and tracked the leader into
the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best.
APPELLANT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found his best stride late while finishing three wide to
get up for a share. AVE'S IN COMMAND away alertly and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, struggled to maintain his
position approaching the final turn, rallied two wide through the turn, and finished one out from the rail in the drive. SPOKANE'S GEM stalked the leader into
the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. TORINO GRAND settled off
the early pace while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid.

UPTOWN FUNKY CAT broke sharply and tracked the leader one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position through the
second turn and in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the the final turn, drifted wide entering the lane, but straightened out and closed
willingly one out from the rail in deep stretch to get up in time. TUXEDO away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time,
dictated the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn while continuing to save ground, increased his margin entering the lane, but was
unable to fend off UPTOWN FUNKY CAT in the closing strides. NORTHERN KID away alertly and was taken in hand and allowed to settle off the early pace
while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in
the drive to get up for a share. ACCEPT NO OTHER stalked the leader three wide entering the stretch the first time, maintained his position in the run down
the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to just miss the show spot. MUD POET stalked the leader
from along the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called upon.
