Footnotes
BIG HEARTED FACTOR chased the pace setter, lost his position on the far turn, responded to pressure and kept on resiliently in the stretch to prevail.
JASIRI settled while four wide, moved closer on the far turn and finished well in the stretch. TAKE THAT FOR DATA led early, was headed on the far turn
and stayed on in the stretch. CAMPAIGN SPY never menaced. XTREME LYRA raced in striking position while three wide, led around the far turn and came
up empty in the stretch. CALL YOU TOMORROW was void of speed. GO GET THAT was always outrun.
