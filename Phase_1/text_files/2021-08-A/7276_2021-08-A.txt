Footnotes
AW ITE away alertly set the pace holding daylight to upper stretch angling from the two to the four path late holding safe. AUGER rushed on the outside
through the turn lost ground coming six wide into upper stretch finishing strong saving place. BLAME IT ON HONEY chased the pace being bumped and
crowded in a chain reaction near the quarter pole, lost momentum into upper stretch finishing evenly at mid track. ARBA hustled along was squeezed and
jostled checking between horses near the quarter losing all chance there. UHAVETOBEKITTENME sent hard came in causing multiple problems near the
quarter pole then weakened down the stretch. SIR HIGGINS slow early had no impact racing six wide down the stretch. AIR FORCE JET (GB) was jammed
on the rail being forced to take up outside the quarter pole. BABY WHITE SOX was squeezed steadying back at the break. YOUR MOM KNOWS was
always outrun. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION UHAVETOBEKITTENME WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH FOR INTERFERENCE WITH
MULTIPLE HORSES NEAR THE QUARTER POLE.

CHEERFUL CHIMES hustled out made the lead setting a pressured pace through the turn saving ground to upper stretch angling off the rail a bit holding on
gamely. LOOPY went evenly coming five wide into upper stretch surging late at mid track pressing the winner in the last strides. CONNIE TOO sent hard
pressed the pace dueling abreast rival down the stretch being carried out a bit while out finished. AZLYNN'S DREAMER a step slow through the turn cut the
corner to upper stretch responding to finish well along the rail. SUGAR BRITCHES chased the pace through the turn weakening under a drive. CONGRATS
GOLDA hesitated breaking a step behind the field. FLAT OUT APPEALING raced mid pack playing no factor. PALM D'ORO was never involved.
SHIPMANS MAGIC was always outrun.

Footnotes
OAK ROOM tracked the pace engaging on the far turn dueling abreast rival in upper stretch drawing away in the late going. SKYDIVING prompted the pace
dueling on the inside through the far turn into upper stretch weakening a sixteenth out holding as second best. EL DUQUE well back early angled five wide
to upper stretch finishing evenly at mid track. EARS UP stalked the early pace fading on the far turn. UNBRIDLEDSELECTION stumbled badly as the rider
lost both irons at the break, quickly regaining stirrups pressed to lead early before flattening out on the far turn.

Footnotes
ORGANZA chased the pace through the turn drawing even in upper stretch wearing foe down to win clear. DILEMMA away alertly set the pace through the
turn being collared on the inside in upper stretch proving no match late. SWEET MISS PABLO chased the pace weakening in upper stretch holding the
others safe. UNUSUALGIFT slow early played no factor. CAUSELUCK ducked out rushing on the outside through the turn before fading in upper stretch.
FLAGGED was never involved. COKERS COWGIRL had brief speed then gave way on the turn. QUID PRO GLOW folded up on the turn.
