kick. GOLDEN SPEAR settled inside through early stages, tipped out at a path at the head of the lane, stayed on with response and got edged out late for
show. TOP BOMB raced outside off the second flight, hustled up five wide at the head of the lane and needed more for serious impact. FEISTY KITTEN
rated between foes, hustled up four wide into the lane and failed to move on. KING LEONARDO tracked the pace between foes, roused forward and vied at
the eighth pole then gave way. BIRDSNEST PARTY set the pace, vied around the far turn, stayed on in the upper stretch then gave way.

the lane and lacked a needed rally. JOYA DEL SUR stalked inside through the backstretch, stayed on around the far turn then gave way in the lane.
