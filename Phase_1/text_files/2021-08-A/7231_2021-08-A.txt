Footnotes
SHOTGUN RIDER was away a step slowly, then was hustled to prompt the pace, was three wide on the second turn, mounted a bid leaving the turn to
collar COUSIN EDDIE inside of the furlong marker and drew clear in the end. PROOF OF PARANOIA settled just off of the early pace, saved ground in the
second turn, closed ground leaving the turn, flattened out in the stretch but held on to save second. COUSIN EDDIE set all of the pace through the second
turn while two wide, was confronted inside of the eighth pole by the winner and weakened in the stretch, and just missed for second. WHISPERING FLAME
settled in the middle of the field, was three wide between foes on the second turn and did not offer a rally in the stretch. MASTER DIAMOND had no speed
in the early going, saved ground on the second turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch run. LONGFORD settled toward the rear of the field, was four
wide on the second turn and was not a factor in the stretch run. COASTING NOW chased COUSIN EDDIE in the early going, then lost ground through the
backstretch and second turn and gave out in the stretch run.

out leaving the furlong marker and made a bold late bid to prevail in the closing stages. JUNE GLOOM stumbled leaving the start and settled at the rear of
the field, was four wide on the second turn, rallied off of that turn and was closing ground in the stretch but was passed in the final yards by the winner while
winning the head nod for second. LUCKY GENERAL settled off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, mounted a bid in the stretch to split
horses inside of the last sixteenth but was outkicked by the winner and just missed for second. SECOND BOLD sat just off of the early pace, was three wide
on the second turn, vied for the lead leaving the turn but was outfinished in the stretch. IMPERATOR stalked the pace through the second turn while saving
ground and tired in the stretch drive. HAWK'S RISING settled in the midlight, saved ground on the second turn and gave way in the stretch. RED'S
SHOWTIME broke on top and set all of the pace through the second turn, was tiring while on the lead into the stretch and faded in the late going.

Footnotes
SASSY EINSTEIN settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the second turn, mounted a bid on the turn, led into the final furlong, was confronted
by the runner-up inside of the sixteenth marker, dueled and won the head nod to prevail. STEIN'S GIRL settled toward the rear of the field, saved ground
while two wide on the second turn, slipped to the rail in the stretch, came to terms with SASSY EINSTEIN inside of the sixteenth-pole, dueled with that rival
and just missed for the win, while a clear second over the rest. SHARP CURVE broke alertly and set the pace with a long lead, was tiring near the head of
the stretch when confronted by the winner but held on for third. ABIGAIL ALDEN tracked SHARP CURVE through the second turn, was two wide on the
turn, closed a bit of ground on that rival off of the turn but weakened in the stretch run. BIG CALI GIRL settled in the midflight through the second turn, was
three wide on the second turn, made a mild gain off of the turn and weakened in the stretch. HASTA LUEGO sat off of the pace, was four wide on the
second turn and was empty for the stretch drive. SWEET MEG had no speed in the early going, lost ground on the second turn while four wide and was not
a factor in the late going.

LET'S REJOYCE was away sharply and set quick fractions while in the two path, extended the lead off of the turn and won in a drive. BIG DUKE sat off of
the pace while three wide on the turn, gained ground off of the turn and outdueled SILENT MOVIES in the stretch for the place spot. SILENT MOVIES
tracked the winner's pace while three wide on the turn, was running evenly in the stretch when confronted by BIG DUKE and was outdueled by that one for
second. SLAM DUNK SERMON chased the pace while saving ground on the turn and tired in the stretch run. BUILDER was off last of the field, saved
ground on the turn and was not a factor in the late going.

AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) was unhurried in the early going, was four wide on the second turn, was bumped when CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE moved out a
path nearing the three-sixteenths marker, mounted a bid leaving the eighth pole and held on over an oncoming CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE at the wire to
prevail. CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE settled toward the rear of the field, gained ground on the second turn while two wide, was moved out nearing the
three-sixteenths marker and impeded DUTCH PAINTING, rallied in the stretch and pressured the winner in the final yards but was denied the win while a
clear second over the rest. STAR OF AFRICA prompted the early pace, was three wide on the second turn while gaining a bit of ground but was outkicked
by the top two in the stretch. DYNASTY OF HER OWN broke on top and set all of the pace through the second turn, had a clear lead off of the second turn
but was quickly confronted and weakened in the final furlong. MISTY CAT settled in the midflight while saving ground, improved position on the second turn
but was outrun in the stretch and outfinished in the drive. DUTCH PAINTING (GB) sat just off of the early leaders, was three wide on the second turn, took
up nearing the three-sixteenths marker when CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was moved out a path and weakened in the late stages. CONVINCE chased the
early leaders, lost position on the second turn and faded in the stretch run. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE
THREE-SIXTEENTHS MARKER INVOLVING #5 DUTCH PAINTING, #6 CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE AND #7 AVENUE DE FRANCE AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE COST #5 DUTCH PAINTING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A BETTER PLACING AND
DISQUALIFIED CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE FROM 2ND TO 6TH.

Footnotes
FRIDAY'S AT SHADY chased the field from the rear, was three wide on the turn, mounted a rally in the stretch, split horses inside of the final sixteenth and
gamely got up in the final stages to prevail. DUB TOWN settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the turn, swung widest to rally in the stretch
and was tagged by the winner while holding for second. POUR ON THE COLE prompted the pace through the turn while two wide, vied for the lead leaving
the turn, led into the final sixteenth but was caught by the top two while just missing for second. BOTTLE OF SMOKE sat just off of the early pace while
three wide on the turn, vied for the lead off of the turn and into the stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth. ARCH PRINCE stalked the pace while
saving ground on the turn and made a mild late bid in the stretch but was not affecting the leaders. STAY GOLDEN broke alertly and set the pace through
the turn while saving ground, was pressured on the turn, relented the lead and weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
WELL DONE SALLY sat just off of the early pacesetter, was three wide on the turn, caught NIP NAP inside of the furlong marker, dueled with FLAG
SALUTE and won the head nod at the end under left-handed encouragement. FLAG SALUTE settled in the midflight, was three wide on the turn, improved
position leaving the turn, dueled with WELL DONE SALLY and was just nipped on the line while besting the rest. CONCISE ADVICE hopped at the start and
was shuffled back leaving the break, chased the field from the rear while saving ground on the turn and rallied in the stretch to win the head nod for third.
ALL MY HOPE sat off of the early pace, was three wide on the turn and rallied in the stretch, just missing for third. CHRIS IS READY was hustled to prompt
the pace by NIP NAP while saving ground on the turn, was outrun off of the turn and was outfinished in the stretch run. NIP NAP set a quick pace through
the turn while saving ground, led into the stretch but was caught by the winner and faded in the late going. UNUSUAL SECRET had no speed in the early
going, was three wide on the turn and did not offer a rally in the stretch. BIG AWARD settled in the middle of the field while saving ground and did not rally in
the stretch.
