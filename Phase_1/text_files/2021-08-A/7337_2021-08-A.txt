Footnotes
LITTLE BIT GOOD saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch, surged between foes late and was up in the final strides. LEA RO pressed the
pace outside of AFFICIONADO, slowly gained on that foe through the lane, finally wore her down but was outkicked by the winner. AFFICIONADO (FR) set
the pace along the rail, fought on inside of foes through the lane and was outfinished in the final strides. NOBLE INTENTIONS tracked the pace two and
three wide, came four wide into the lane and could only incrementally gain outside of the top three finishers. NYMUE'S TREASURE stalked the pace inside,
angled three wide turning for home and lacked a rally. CODRINGTON failed to menace while racing two wide. CLASSY OF COURSE broke in the air, was
quite rank into and around the first turn, raced three wide and never threatened. JOST SAYIN was outrun inside.

GOLDEN JUAN vied inside CAJUN INVASION for a half-mile, got the best of that dispute turning for home, and widened the advantage kept to pressure.
MR MAC QUHAE advanced gradually three then four wide after a half, stayed on his left lead through the lane and went clear of the rest. EUPHORIA STAR
was outsprinted to the turn, moved in from the three-path to the rail approaching the stretch, and offered a mild response. CAJUN INVASION dueled outside
GOLDEN JUAN early, could not match strides at the top of the lane, and weakened on his left lead. BOGGIEMIESTER stayed close early, and faded under
a drive around the turn. BIG BOY TIZZY took an initial stride to the right at the break and was slowest away, and dropped far back after a half.

ROSY APPLE broke a bit awkwardly, set the pace along the rail, drew clear nearing the five-sixteenths pole and widened under a drive. FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO broke awkwardly but quickest of all, vied outside of the winner down the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, angled in near the
quarter pole and was clearly second best. SOLAR GIRL saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. FLOURISHING played no factor while
racing four wide. GOOD TROUBLE chased the pace three wide and retreated after a half.

Footnotes
JUPITER BLUES stayed close early outside, moved inward after a half-mile, came back out for clearance rallying in midstretch, got past BARREL PROOF
and edged clear. BARREL PROOF bumped with MALIBU MANDATE at the start, hustled up on the rail to take over before going a quarter-mile, shook off
BLAKENSTEIN after a half, yielded to the winner on his left lead leaving the furlong grounds and remained best of the others. THE BEAST GOES ON saved
ground outrun to the stretch, and rallied mildly on the rail. NO COMMISSION raced three to four wide in range on the turn, and flattened out through the
drive. HALO'S DANCE bumped with MALIBU MANDATE at the start, trailed early two wide, and improved position through the stretch without threatening.
BLAKENSTEIN led early before deferring to BARREL PROOF, pressed that one for a half and tired. MALIBU MANDATE got bumped between horses at the
break and was slowest away, and was outrun near the inside. HARD ASTRAY stumbled at the start, showed brief speed outside, stopped on the turn and
jogged in. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TAKE ME AS I AM set the pace along the rail, dug in when confronted by MORNING COLORS near the quarter poled, vied inside that foe past the eighth
pole and re-cleared late. MORNING COLORS pressed the winner two wide, reached near even terms turning for home, vied past the eighth pole but was
turned back in the final furlong. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY had early speed between the top two finishers, rated back and angled in midway around the first
turn, stalked inside under a firm hold down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally while holding clear of the
rest. RED WIND bumped with CHIPS AND SALSA at the start, was in range three wide and lacked the needed rally. KATZ A DREAM was bumped between
foes entering the first turn, raced two and wide and went evenly. ANONYMOUS SOURCE failed to menace while racing two wide. CAPTURE THE GENIE
saved ground, checked midway around the first turn and made little impact. PERFECT KIMBERLY S steadied entering the first turn, checked midway
around that bend, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. CHIPS AND SALSA bumped with RED WIND at the start, raced three wide and
had no response. FIRST GOLD was bumped entering the first turn, raced three wide and was never in contention.

DEVILETTE dueled inside PERFECT PROVISION for a half-mile, got away from that rival approaching the top of the stretch, and widened under a steady
drive. CHROME RACER raced two to three wide around the turn in the second flight, and rallied through the lane to go clear for the place. PERFECT
PROVISION vied outside DEVILETTE for a half, drifted out weakening at the top of the stretch, and ran on widest to salvage the show. STRATEGY QUEEN
broke slowly, and posed no threat four wide. TORA LORA LORA was no factor inside. MADEFORSUMMER hit the left side of the gate and was off slow,
was outrun to the lane, and lugged in through the furlong grounds. MOON PARTY chased after the leaders three to four wide, and was finished after a half.

Footnotes
KAHIKO stalked the pace inside, advanced two wide around the far turn, put a head in front nearing the eighth pole and drew off under a drive.
CENTSLESS DRAMA rated in the three path around the first turn, cruised up down the backstretch, took over near the seven-sixteenths pole, quickly
cleared, angled in around the far turn, led to midstretch and was clearly second best. EXTRAVAGANT ROSIE settled off the early pace two wide, edged
closer between foe rounding the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. HOT BABE chased the pace three wide and faded in the lane. CHOOSE TO BE
HAPPY saved ground to no avail. HAPPY THOUGHT was outrun while racing two wide. TWIRLING STAR was shuffled back entering the first turn, raced
two and three wide and never threatened. SILVER TUNES set the pace along the rail and was through after a half.

Footnotes
ROUGH ENTRY dueled inside FRONT LOADED for a half-mile, put daylight on that rival going comfortably nearing the stretch, was roused mildly once
straightened away for the drive, and widened through the last eighth of a mile in hand. SEPTEMBERTEN was never far back, came five wide off the turn
and rallied mildly to go clear for the place. FRONT LOADED dueled outside ROUGH ENTRY for a half, could not match strides approaching the stretch, and
saved the show. UNCORK THE BOTTLE raced between horses into the turn, shifted out to the four-path at the head of the lane, and weakened through the
furlong grounds. GANGLY lost his footing at the start, and was no factor widest throughout. BELLAVIA broke two lengths slow, moved up to stay close for a
half, had nothing left in the stretch and was vanned off after the finish.

UNIMPEACHED led early, settled back inside around the first turn, edged closer inside around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter pole, steadily
gained outside through the lane and was up in deep stretch. ROYAL WAR had speed between foes, steadied when ADMIRAL TRUFFLES angled in
midway around the first turn, angled out early on the backstretch, re-bid three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, drew clear nearing the lane, held
clear past the eighth pole, drifted out late and was overhauled. HONESTO raced off the early pace three wide advanced outside down the backstretch,
chased three wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. ZIGGY hit the starting gate and was away several lengths slowly, saved ground well
back early, advanced three wide around the far turn and evened out in the lane. SMART SOLDIER raced off the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper
stretch and never threatened. BACKCHAT saved ground off the pace around the first turn, went three and four wide around the far turn and retreated.
ADMIRAL TRUFFLES vied three wide early, cleared midway around the first turn, set the pace along the rail down the backstretch and faltered around the
far turn.
