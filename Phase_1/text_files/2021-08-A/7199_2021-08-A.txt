PEERLESS COURT never far back, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain, edged ahead and held
under mild urging. OVERTHOUGHT chased the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, then lacked the
needed late kick. THATS MARGE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened in the late going.

steady pressure. ZURI allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the lane, then could not threaten the

Footnotes
WE THE CLOUDS mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a steady
gain and drove clear. FORGOTTEN PEACE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then was
no match for the winner and held the place. TOOLCAT tracked the pace, gained position on the two path through the second turn, bid outside the leader into
the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. BRASSY allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path and improved
position. TILTINGATWINDMILLS allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and had no rally. KELTOI well
placed and outside, faded after a half.

outfinished. NATURAL POWER (IRE) mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then closed willingly and
missed. DIAMOND DUST set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. SMOKY BLUES

Footnotes
CORT'N ASONG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task.
GOLD WING mid pack, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and closed well for the place. TALK TO THE MEDIA
tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, bid outside the leader into the stretch, weakened late and held the show. LEAVEITALONELARRY well
placed and outside, held position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong, holding a share.
AMERICAN CAMP allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. BAHAMIAN
PARK allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, then had no rally. THAT'S BUCKBEAK stalked the pace on the outside, bid
three wide outside that one and faded in the lane. TAPITOR was no factor.
