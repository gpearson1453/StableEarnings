SHARED SENSE tracked the pace early on, took over command nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane, inched clear down the lane and held
sway in the final stages. BEAU LUMINARIE was in tight and steadied into the first turn, trailed the field early on, was in the four path into the lane, rallied in
the upper stretch, made a three wide bid near the eighth pole but lugged in and out with no final gain on the winner in the late stages. BEAVER HAT was
steadied into the first turn, stalked the pace early on, was in the three path into the lane and up for show in the final stages. FACT FINDING stumbled badly
at the start but recovered quickly and set the early pace, was overtaken nearing the lane while off the rail into the lane and faltered late in the stretch run.
ROYAL MESA tracked the pace early on, was in the four path into the lane and weakened down the lane.
