Footnotes
BEZEL SET broke on top and was quickly clear, showed the way in hand just off the rail, responded to urging upper stretch, steadily opened up and was
kept to task to the wire. PINCH MINE raced closest to BEZEL SET from just outside, came into the lane behind the latter, proved no match but was
unchallenged for second. FULL OF HEART moved to the inside early on, raced in contention for six furlongs then could only hold her position deep stretch.
INSTA GLAM soon trailed, chased from just off the inside, angled out through the second bend and had no late bid. VERRAZANO WOMAN was a factor
from outside but began to yield from path three before finishing six furlongs.

REJOICE AN BE GLAD steadied from inside behind MIZ CLIPPER into the first bend, was kept close along the rail, roused with two furlongs to go, took
over upper stretch and gradually widened command the last eighth under urging. MIZ CLIPPER took the lead and the inside into the first turn, was
challenged from outside on the backstretch, roused from between rivals leaving the second bend and did not have enough left for the drive. LADY
EXPRESS advanced from outside to share the lead outside MIZ CLIPPER on the backstretch, continued to dispute the pace to upper stretch then began to
wear down. SING KITTY SING soon trailed, stayed a contender from well off the inside for six furlongs then gave way.

Footnotes
MAGNA LEE was sent up from inside to gain the lead midway on the backstretch, roused again leaving the quarter pole, lengthened command under a
drive in the stretch and maintained control while kept to task until nearing the wire. ABOVE NIKE broke on top, was soon chasing MAGNA LEE from just
outside, drifted out leaving the bend and upper stretch, was straightened approaching the eighth pole, gradually closed the gap the final furlong, was too late
but easily second best. BRIANS WAY unruly in the gate, raced in contention just outside ABOVE NIKE for a half mile, angled inside that one when ABOVE
NIKE came out upper stretch, was no match for the top pair but was unchallenged for third. HE'S SO WILD chased from outside and failed to menace.
FADE FROM BLACK void of speed, though urged along from the early going, showed little in a ground-saving trip.

HIDDEN FIGURE was bumped solidly then checked behind SONG AND A KISS, settled outside, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, advanced widest
on the bend, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure as she rallied in the lane, took the lead inside the last eighth, steadily widened command and
kept to urging until the last seventy yards. REPEAL disputed the pace from inside, moved clear on the turn, was under a drive in the lane, no match for
HIDDEN FIGURE as she began to wear down deep stretch but stayed clear for the place. SONG AND A KISS broke outward, bumped hard with HIDDEN
FIGURE, chased from inside, came off the rail after two furlongs, was two wide on the bend, angled out widest upper stretch, lacked a significant bid but
caught HOMETOWN PROSPECT for third. HOMETOWN PROSPECT reluctant to load, displayed early speed from outside once the race began, did not
keep up on the turn, came into the stretch from path three and began to fade. FILLY FROM ILLY faded along the rail on the bend. PRINCESS MANDII
raced in the second flight on the backstretch but gave way from path three on the bend.

Footnotes
FAST ONE broke alertly, showed the way in hand from just off or along the rail, was put to urging at the top of the lane, drew away, began to drift out under
left-handed pressure with a sixteenth left, was straightened and allowed to finish the race without any encouragement. LEE LA DEW bumped with B'S
TURNING POINT at the break, was rated from along the rail, checked solidly when his path was taken into the second turn, angled out some on the bend,
rallied two wide in the stretch and drew off for second inside the last furlong. SYMBOLIST pressed FAST ONE from just outside for six furlongs, was no
match for that one when set down for the drive and flattened out the final eighth. CLEVER BOY raced in contention from between horses, moved to the rail
into the second bend and gave way from inside the final quarter mile. B'S TURNING POINT bumped with LEE LA DEW at the start and steadily retreated
from outside.

Footnotes
W W HOTSHOT broke inward, was corrected and sent to gain a clear early lead, roused again leaving the bend then maintained full control under steady
urging through the stretch. STEALIN' SUMMER forwardly placed from outside, was three wide on the turn, angled in some for the drive, took over second
upper stretch, could not close the gap on the leader but drew away for the place the final furlong. W W RUSSIAN GOLD caught in tight quarters between
rivals on the backstretch, moved to the inside into the turn, angled to the outside at the top of the lane, drifted out further, lacked a significant response but
drew clear for third late. DEVIL'S RULE was prominent just outside W W HOTSHOT for a half mile, moved to the rail at the top of the stretch and began to
flatten out. A BOLD RYDE failed to menace.

Footnotes
DR. LIECHTY bore in at the start, bumping hard with TURN YOUR EYES, was straightened and soon took the lead, showed the way just off or along the
rail, was roused into the lane, put to a drive inside the last eighth, drifted out some under left-handed pressure but held on. TURN YOUR EYES was bumped
hard and forced into FAIRWAY LANE at the break, boxed in and bumped several times with PURGING THE STONE after the first furlong, began to move
inside midway on the backstretch, took over second along the rail on the bend, moved outside DR. LIECHTY entering the stretch, steadily closed the gap on
the leader inside the final furlong but came up short. COLOMBARD chased from inside, angled out some to advance two wide on the turn, battled for third in
the lane and was closing in on the top pair late. TRUE TEN broke very alertly, was soon overtaken from inside, was two wide on the bend, began to yield
some as he floated out entering the stretch, fought to hold onto third but leveled off in the waning yards. FAIRWAY LANE was bumped hard by TURN
YOUR EYES and forced inward at the start, chased from between rivals, did not keep up on the turn, moved to the rail upper stretch and showed a
willingness to run late. PURGING THE STONE a step slow at the start, advanced from outside, was bumped a few times by TURN YOUR EYES after the
first eighth of a mile, was three wide on the bend, carried out some by TRUE TEN leaving the turn and ran evenly through the lane.
FORAFEWDOLLARSMORE soon trailed from just off the inside, angled out through the bend, came widest into the stretch and had no late bid. The rider of
TURN YOUR EYES lodged an objection claiming interference from DR. LIECHTY at the start. After their review, the stewards disqualified DR. LIECHTY
and placed him second.
