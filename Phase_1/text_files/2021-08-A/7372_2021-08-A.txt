Footnotes
SOUPER CLASSY stalked the pace, closed three to five-wide on the turn, rallied outside and was up late under a drive. SOUPER RIVER broke inward but
moved up quickly to duel, battled on the rail, shook clear briefly at the top of the stretch and was caught in the final yards. KID FORESTER stalked the pace,
closed two and three-wide on the turn, bid approaching the stretch but was quickly headed, rallied determinedly but was outkicked. EXCEED stalked the
pace, closed along the rail on the turn and finished all out on the fence. TRADING BAY forced the pace, chased three and four-wide late turn but evened out
in the final furlong. DANCING DRAGON dueled, gave way late turn and tired.

COCOTARA led quickly, set a reserved pace, quickened on the far turn, was headed a furlong out but bravely held the place. KNEW AS A BREEZE stalked
the pace, chased two-wide on the far turn, rallied between foes and was in striking distance, did not get off a bid but finished gamely. FANCYSOUL broke in
the air and settled off the pace, angled from the rail to three-wide midway through the far turn, chased to the stretch and rallied gamely. RELENTLESS
RUBY, in range, was hustled two-wide on the final turn and rallied determinedly. JOCASSEE settled in mid pack and had a rail trip, was hustled on the far

Footnotes
ANITA GRIGIO set a pressured pace, repelled NAITAKA late turn and again in the stretch then drew away in the late stages and finished under a hand ride.
NAITAKA forced the pace, failed with a challenge late turn and launched a strong bid in the stretch, could not draw even and chased to the end. SADIE
IRENE stalked the pace, was hustled late turn, rallied mildly but did not menace. CALAIS COVE raced in mid pack, was hustled three-wide late turn, moved
inward upper stretch and chased in vain. MERINO WOOL broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled three to five-wide on the turn but never
reached contention. RASPBERRY WILD settled off the pace, closed along the rail through the turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. LIGHT IT
UP broke outward and was steadied, settled off the pace, was hustled angling in from four-wide to the second path on the turn but had no closing response.

hustled two-wide on the turn but failed to menace. ECHO IN THE FOREST settled off the pace, came three and four-wide on the turn, was not a threat but
did show interest late. FLAWLESS PINK dueled, dropped back midway through the backstretch and fell back again on the turn then rallied between rivals in
the stretch. QUEEN ANDHER COURT settled off the pace, was hustled from the rail and two-wide on the turn but never reached contention. SILENT

Footnotes
FIFTH ANNIVERSARY won the break but was taken back to stalk the two early leaders, bid three wide at the quarter pole and led turning for home, cleared
off by the eighth pole and was kept to her task under vigorous handling to maintain a safe margin. BAKSHEESH had one beat early, was steadied in behind
rivals to trail late backstretch, swung out to four wide at the quarter pole and in the six path in upper stretch, closing with purposeful strides to go by them all
but the winner while widest. EXIT STAGE RIGHT stalked the early pacesetter, bid inside eventual winner at the quarter pole and had a brief lead but
couldn't match the energy of that foe and managed to hold the show spot after the place horse went whizzing by in the late stages. LOADED VIXEN was
pinched back and steadied early on, able to get over to the rail chasing the leaders, angled out to look dangerous midway on the turn but could only run
evenly down the lane and hang on for a minor award. CLASSIC QUEEN settled in midpack, two to three wide throughout and put in a mild close down the
lane, continuing to inch up late without threatening. SUGAR IS GOLDEN sent to the lead from her inside post, was stalked and pressed by two foes on the
turn and relinquished the lead by the quarter pole, fighting on for a furlong before retreating in the later stages. STREGA sat in midpack along the rail and
appeared to be backing up midway on the turn, then figured it out in midstretch and found her best stride late, galloping out very well after the wire. MISS
NAHA TE off the pace and looking uncomfortable between rivals on the turn, never entering contention. AVIE'S BOSS was steadied out hard in the early
going, trailed and put in a big run to get by a few when three wide into the turn, but stalled by the time the stretch arrived.

RELIABILITY lost his path at the start and settled off the pace, came two to four-wide through the far turn, rallied outside and was just up under a drive.
GREEN FLEET broke inward and bumped BIRCHMOUNT RD, settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn, battled through the stretch but was
outfinished. ULTIMATE STORM set a pressured pace, was clear on the backstretch and far turn then gave way grudgingly in deep stretch. MEYER stalked
the pace, was hustled three-wide on the far turn, dueled briefly in the stretch and gave way. MUSKOKA GIANT broke inward and settled off the pace, was
hustled four and five-wide on the far turn then finished under a determined drive. LUMBERJACK stalked the pace from the rail, was all out in the stretch but
weakened late. GRAZELY, off slowly, forced the pace into the backstretch, chased two and three-wide on the far turn then lacked a closing response.
CANADIAN PHAROAH broke outward and settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch but failed to menace.
BIRCHMOUNT RD, bumped at the start, settled off the pace, came three and four-wide through the final turn then finished evenly. HAVE A SOUPER DAY
broke in the air, had a rail trip in mid pack but evened out in the stretch.

Footnotes
DOLDER GRAND off the pace set by two rivals on a long lead, advanced two to four wide at the quarter pole, tipped out into the six path turning for home
and drove by outside the leader at the sixteenth pole, in hand the final few strides when clearly going best. SOUPER WATSON rallied from off the pace to
be in behind the leaders with no path at the quarter pole, shifted out to find a seam turning for home and drove to the front in upper stretch, a clear lead at
the eighth pole but collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole, a clear second best. FINALIST led quickly out in the three path into the first turn, took back
to let a rival go on the backside, bid and regained the front late on the far turn and had command in upper stretch but tired in the final furlong, stubbornly
holding on to the show over his race long pace buddy. GUESTIMATION pressed four wide outside a rival into the first turn, took the lead from that one down
the backstretch when the pair opened up a wide margin over the rest of the field, headed by that same rival on the far turn, battling that one down the lane
but outgamed for the show. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE off the pace and two wide throughout, besting the balance down the lane with a mild rally.
PRIDEOFDISTINCTION three wide and off the pace around the first turn, circled up four wide to make it three in a line for the lead late on the far turn, but
stalled at the furlong pole and could not carry on with his rally. HIT THE POINT trailed the field inside before rallying mildly up the rail to get in behind the
pack of also rans down the lane. ARGENTIUM three to two wide around the first turn, moved up to stalk the leaders three wide on the far turn, was a tad
intimidated when the place horse came up to his inside nearing the stretch and retreated down the lane.

stretch then rallied willingly from the outside. SPIN THAT TUNE bumped with LEAVEYOUBREATHLESS at the outset, dueled briefly then settled just off the
pace, was hustled from the rail on the turn, angled out a bit in the stretch then finished gamely. CEDAR VALLEY, in range, closed three-wide on the turn
then chased gamely to the wire. RED FUJI broke in the air and bumped LEAVEYOUBREATHLESS, had speed and gained the lead, dueled on the turn,
shook clear at the top of the stretch but was passed a furlong out and evened out. IS THERE A FOREST bumped with CRIMSON INVASION leaving the
gate, forced the pace, dueled two-wide on the turn, was headed at the top of the stretch, chased, then evened out. CRIMSON INVASION bumped with lS
THERE A FOREST leaving the gate, settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn then finished evenly. PRACTICAL GIZMO broke
sharply, stalked the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn, lost ground at the top of the stretch and leveled out. LEAVEYOUBREATHLESS
bumped between SPIN THAT TURN and RED FUJI at the break, settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail through the turn but lacked a rally.
