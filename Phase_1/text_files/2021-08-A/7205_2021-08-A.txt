Footnotes
ABOGADA settled off of the pace in the three path around the first turn, gained four wide around the far turn, then sustained that rally through the final
furlong to drive past inner foes approaching the wire. TEMPESTUOUS AMY saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, shifted outside of foes down
the backstretch, inched closer to press the leaders before dueling outside of ALLOUTPATRICIA around the far turn, bid for the lead approaching the furlong
grounds, led passing the sixteenth pole as AOBGADA ranged up alongside, but was outkicked by that foe late. ALLOUTPATRICIA stalked the clear leader
around the first turn, ranged up to that foe passing the five furlong pole, showed the way from a vying TEMPESTUOUS AMY while staying a path off of the
rail around the far turn, clung to a margin through midstretch but gave way to a pair of outer foes a sixteenth out. MALICED hopped at the start, saved
ground at the back of the back around the first turn, progressed in hand down the backstretch to stalk the dueling pair from the two path around the far turn,
chased along the rail through upper stretch, but lacked a kick to produce a bid. COLORINCOLONEL cleared off early on, met ALLOUTPATRICIA's bid at
the five furlong pole, then faltered through the field around the far turn.

Footnotes
BRODYTHEOXMAN stalked the clear leader from the two path around the first turn, inched closer to bid into the far turn, drew clear approaching the five
sixteenths pole as NEW YEAR'S LUCK pursued, floated that foe wide by drifted multiple paths outwards entering the lane, but held firm from that foe's inner
challenge through the final furlong. NEW YEAR'S LUCK trailed three wide, gained down the backstretch to press the leading pair into the far turn, chased
BRODYTHEOXMAN around that bend while under steady urging, got floated multiple paths out by that foe entering the lane before shifting inside of that foe
in upper stretch, kept on to produce a bid through the final furlong, but did not have enough to catch the outer leader. LEMON BLITZ chased from midpack
along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and failed to threaten the leaders. EMPEROR'S GOLD cleared off early on, but BRODYTHEOXMAN's
bid into the far turn, failed to keep pace approaching the five sixteenths pole, and faded thereafter. ANIMAL KRACKERS never got involved.

MIGHTY ANGEL vied three wide early on, dueled for the lead outside of PETIT VERDOT while staying a path off of the rail around the turn, then drew clear
passing the furlong grounds. ORB OF THE BORO trailed early on, gained four wide around the turn, then stayed on through the lane to catch a tiring foe for
place on the wire. PETIT VERDOT led between horses early on before dueling inside of MIGHTY ANGEL while staying path off of the rail around the turn,
but yielded to that foe passing the furlong pole, gave way, and was nailed on the wire for place. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS vied along the inside down the

Footnotes
SILVER LULU prompted the pace three wide, cleared inner foes at the five sixteenths pole with BOURBON BUNS giving chase, then held firm from that foe
before widening late. BOURBON BUNS tracked four wide, attempted a bid for the lead outside of SILVER LULU turning for home, but failed to keep pace
entering the lane, sustained the chase to deep stretch, but tired through the final sixteenth before holding place. PANGEA set the pace two wide and from
between horses, but proved no match for her outer counterpart approaching the five sixteenths pole, but sustained chasing position through the lane to hold
show. CALIFORNIA KITTY lied off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but failed to mount a rally. MY HEAD HURTS broke slowly,
rushed early on to vie inside of foes after a furlong, but faded passing the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
HOLIDAY DANCER took up soon after the start and trailed the field early on, lied far off of the pace in the two path into the turn, swung five wide entering
the lane, and rallied outside of foes while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong to wear down the leader strides from the wire.
SHARINGTHEJOURNEY set the pace inside of a pair of foes around the turn, shook clear of those rivals entering the lane before shifting multiple paths
outwards in upper stretch, managed a clear margin through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but was challenged by HOLIDAY DANCER a sixteenth
out, and was worn down approaching the wire. CHEROKEE HAWK pressed the pace four to three wide into the turn, then chased evenly through the lane.
NINJA vied for the lead two wide and between horses into the turn, but yielded to his inner counterpart at the quarter pole, sustained the chase through
midstretch, but faded late. NEW YORK NIGHT lied far off of the pace in the three path into the turn, got floated six wide by the eventual winner turning for
home, but failed to match rallying strides with that rival in upper stretch, but stayed on to threaten a minor share late. HALABOUTTHAT tucked behind the
leading duo into the turn, saved ground while stalking, but lacked a kick through a rail seem through the lane before fading. TOP HAT TROUBADOUR was
outrun.

Footnotes
FREDERICKTOWN stalked from just behind the dueling pair into the turn, tipped outside of those foes entering the lane, rallied to range up to the clear
leader passing the furlong pole while requiring rider's correction from lugging in, then drove clear of that rival through the late stages. AUDACIOUS
ANTOINE set the pace inside of a pressing LINE OF GOLD, shook clear of that foe in upper stretch, but was worn down by an outer rallying rival a sixteenth
out. COME SEE ABOUT IT chased three wide and outside of FREDERICKTOWN around the turn, got floated four wide by that foe while getting outkicked
entering the lane, then kept on thereafter the achieve show. LINE OF GOLD pressed the pace two wide, but gave way between horses in upper stretch.
PLONDER saved ground from midpack, but faded turning for home. KING T'CHALLA lied off of the pace two wide, pulled while hard to handle into the turn,
then tired in upper stretch. OSMI SLEW never got involved.

OLE WATASHI stalked the dueling pair around the turn, rallied outside of those foes to drive past them at the furlong grounds, then just held from a lunging
HEIDI'S SINATRA on the wire. HEIDI'S SINATRA saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide in upper stretch, rallied late to bid approaching the wire,
but ran out of ground. TRUST AND OBEY vied along the inside around the turn, but offered little resistance to a bidding foe at the furlong grounds, and gave
way. COREY'S CATCH tracked along the inside, shifted four wide turning for home, but lacked a rally. KINETIC ART vied two wide, but weakened passing
the furlong pole. BUCKEYE WARRIOR was outrun. INSPIRED TO ROCK clipped heels with FEISTY RUBIANO into the turn, and lost his rider, then was
corralled by the outrider and walked off. FEISTY RUBIANO vied three wide early on, but went wrong approaching the seven sixteenths pole, pulled up into
the turn, was untacked around the five sixteenths pole, then walked off.
