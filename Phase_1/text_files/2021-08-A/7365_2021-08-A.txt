midstretch and prevailed determinedly. STREET PRAYER was bumped and steadied at the start, raced off the pace, made a four wide run on the turn, put a
head in front turning for home, dueled outside of RUN FAST through the stretch drive and dug in gamely to the end. UNCAPTURED SOLDIER was bumped
hard at the start, raced off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, angled out three wide approaching the quarter pole, then lacked a winning bid. FIFTY

Footnotes
KOSCIUSZKO stalked close up two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, kicked clear, dug in gamely in the lane and held well late for the win. RELISHMENT
trailed the field, split rivals on the far turn, angled out, rallied late outside and finished well to get up for second. HIGH FIVE COTTON stalked three wide, bid
three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied and lost second nearing the wire. ZITMAN tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far
turn, moved up between horses at the quarter pole, then was outkicked. FEDERAL CASE set the pace, dueled on the far turn and tired. COBH raced off the
pace inside and failed to threaten. COACH ADAMS raced off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the stretch and had no rally. DON'T POKE THE CAT
fractious in the gate, stalked between rivals and gave way.

and coasted late. BOLD CONFECTION dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in gamely between rivals in upper stretch and proved second
best. MILESTONE PAYMENT (IRE) moved up early on the rail to contest the pace, dueled inside, dug in at the top of the lane, then weakened. GOD STILL
LOVES ME steadied at the start, outrun early and passed tired ones. NICKYS NOTION raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane and
had no rally. SINGLEBERYLBOURBON chased inside and tired. MS. GUCCI GIRL raced two wide and was outrun.

gained a short lead and edged away late for the win. RUNNING MEMORIES set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the turn, dug in gamely inside in
the stretch drive, yielded and earned the place award. NO MERCY PERCY raced two wide off the pace, chased on the turn, closed late on the rail and got
up for third. MISS AURAMET tracked close up on the inside, came two wide into the lane, rallied between horses in upper stretch, was outkicked and lost
third at the wire. RITHM BOX raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and had no rally. LOVE AND PEACE (FR) steadied in tight leaving the chute,
raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and failed to threaten. MARIES MELODY was outrun.

Footnotes
WICKED REBEL stalked outside a rival, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dueled into the stretch, pulled away and was ridden out. NEPTUNES REVENGE
stalked the early pacesetter, bid two wide on the turn, dueled with the winner entering the stretch, dug in and held on for second. ALITE chased close up on
the inside, angled out at the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. DIAMANTE DE ORO was off slowly and steadied, outrun
early and closed belatedly. POSTINO'S STORY stumbled badly at the start, outrun early and did not factor. HOTEL CHARLIE set the pace, dueled inside
on the turn and gave way.
