INVINCIBELLA (GB) tracked on the inside off the pace, swung out into the stretch, rallied and outkicked STORMING LADY in the final furlong. STORMING
LADY settled off the pace, angled four wide on the turn, got floated out five wide into the stretch, rallied but was bested by the winner. SMILING ANNIE
pressed the pace three deep, vied between on the turn, led in upper stretch, cleared with a furlong to go then yielded to the top pair and held the show. ON
DECK traveled off the rail or outside rivals early, angled five wide around the turn, got floated six wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award.
SAVING SOPHIE off a bit slow to begin, lost path behind INVINCIBELLA early, saved ground around the bend and summoned a mild rally. MISS KITNESS
set the pace under pressure from a trio of rivals, vied with a pair of foes around the turn, overtaken at the top of the stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. MALIBU MISTRESS up close early between the top trio, could not keep pace and chased into the turn, went three wide into the lane and flattened
out. I'M THE HERO showed early speed four deep up the backstretch, vied for the lead three deep on the turn, lost contact in upper stretch and faded inside
the furlong grounds. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
FANTASY HEAT stalked the pace and angled to the inside, saved ground through the turn, angled outside the leader in the stretch, got carried wide by that
rival lugging out in the furlong grounds, took over in the final sixteenth and prevailed over the runner-up. BEAUTIFUL BALLAD trailed early, angled in on the
turn, angled out in upper stretch, closed fast and was gaining to the wire. GIDGETTA bumped shortly after the start, rallied up the fence and got outkicked
by the top pair. ANGELCENTS bumped with GIDGETTA soon after the start, went up to set the pace under pressure, cleared at the three-eighths, inched
away on the turn, lugged out through the final furlong and weakened late. NEVER FOR MONEY broke out, chased off the inside, two to then three wide on
the turn, lugged out late and lacked a bid. FIVE PICS PLEASE pressed the pace from outside, could not match strides past the three-eighths pole, chased
two wide into the drive and weakened. ANA LISA steadied in tight between rivals early, went two to three wide into the stretch and never made an impact.

PAINT ME LUCKY fractious in the gate, showed early speed from inside, pulled around the first turn, steered out on the backstretch, launched a bid at the
three-eighths, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, took over with a quarter mile remaining, kicked clear then weakened in the final sixteenth and held late.
PRINCE ZIGGY got bumped leaving the gate, traveled near the back of the pack, came four wide into the stretch, rallied through the late stages but was too
late. BOLD VOYAGER bumped both sides at the start, vied three deep into the first turn, pressed three deep on the backstretch, chased past the half-mile
pole, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. INVESTMENT ACCOUNT had early speed between rivals then was ceded the lead into the first
turn, chased in the two path into the drive and also went evenly late. HEIR (FR) bumped outside rival at the start, vied between then cleared briefly around
the first turn, gained pressured into the backstretch, cleared again past the nine-sixteenths pole, got headed at the five-sixteenths, relinquished the lead at
the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. MONGOL ALTAI trailed early and passed tired rivals in the lane. WHISTLEBLOWER angled from the
four path down to the two path on the first turn, steered to the inside on the backstretch, exited the second bend two wide and was never a factor. BIG
WELL showed early speed five then four wide on the first turn, was forwardly placed outside rivals early, came three wide into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
HELENS WELL (IRE) hesitated and was off slow to begin, went between rivals around the first turn, settled off the pace, exited the far turn four wide, closed
fast and overhauled the top pair in deep stretch. VERY SCARY steadied briefly around the first turn, went outside rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole,
challenged into the stretch, battled down the lane, was overtaken by the winner but kept to task to hold the place. LIAM'S DOVE broke in and bumped rival
at the start, sped to the front, set the pace to the second turn, pressured leaving the bend, dueled through the lane and missed the place. HEMMERLE lost
path into the first turn, raced off the pace early, between foes on the backstretch then moved closer nearing the far turn, advanced two wide around the
bend, angled out in upper stretch and kept on willingly to the wire. A CROWN FOR KITTEN traveled in mid-pack early on, entered the stretch three wide
and never produced a bid. BEACHGRASS angled to the inside and settled off the pace, exited the far turn two wide and lacked further response. CARROLL
GIRL traveled near the back of the pack, came five wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and lacked a rally. SET THE TONE threw her head and
was off slow, steadied off heels nearing the first turn, angled three wide on the far turn, shifted inward in upper stretch and failed to menace.
MACRELLETTA got bumped from outside at the start, chased on the inside, dropped back on the far turn, bothered by SET THE TONE shifting inward in
upper stretch and weakened. SOUL OF A WARRIOR stalked the pace outside a rival, lost ground on the far turn and faded in the drive.

FLAT OUT JOY chased the leader early then went up to duel from outside, battled around the turn and into the lane, shook free in upper stretch and drew
off. ANGEL'S ADVOCATE was off alertly to take control crossed over to the two path, dueled with FLAT OUT JOY into and around the bend, could not go
on with the winner in upper stretch, flattened out late but saved the place. SECRET MANEUVER lacked early speed, advanced five wide around the turn
and rallied for the show. LISTEN TO BLUE dropped back early, lacked room around the turn, steadied into the stretch, angled in at the three-sixteenths,
tipped out in the lane and finished willingly. BOLD MISTRESS stalked the top pair from outside, chased four wide through the turn and weakened. PASITO
tracked off the pace on the inside, angled four wide around the bend and never rallied. JAMMINJL sat off the pace up the backstretch, went four wide into
the turn, five wide into the stretch and never made an impact. DARING CAT mid-pack early between rivals, took the turn two wide and came up empty.
SECRET MISTRESS forwardly placed early along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, had the rider lose the whip at the eighth pole and faded. COAL
SHAFT tossed his head her head leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the group three deep, chased three wide into the drive and had little left. TRAFFIC
STOPPER traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, navigated the turn along the inside and tired.

Footnotes
PULPIT RIDER off slow to begin, unhurried at the back on the inside, tipped out while trailing into the stretch, rallied two then three wide in the lane and got
up in time. NARDINI brushed with SEDAMAR at the start, was closest in pursuit from the two path, moved out in the lane, bid outside with a furlong
remaining, struck the front mid-stretch but got nailed at the wire. WARREN'S SHOWTIME raced three around the first turn, stalked outside a rival into the
second bend, continued three wide to the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and finished evenly. LEGGS GALORE jumped out to the lead quickly, set the
pace clear on the inside, roused with a quarter mile remaining, held a short lead with a furlong to go, relinquished control mid-stretch and weakened late.
SEDAMAR brushed with inner rival then got shuffled back shortly after the start, tracked off the pace outside a rival or two wide, came three wide into the
stretch and lacked a rally. CASSIE BELLE angled to the rail early, saved ground to the stretch and lacked the needed late punch.

CAUSEIDIDITMYWAY went four wide around the first turn, came out some into the backstretch, traveled four deep outside the leader, chased four wide into
the lane, dug in outside the top pair and edged away late. LEPRINO stalked three wide around the first turn, went up three deep outside the pacesetter,
challenged into the far turn, dueled around the bend and into the stretch and continued gamely to the wire. CAJUN TREASURE away quickly from the start,
led into the clubhouse turn then lost command nearing the three-quarter pole, pressed between rivals then bid between into the second bend, dueled
around that turn and into the stretch, held a short lead with a furlong to go and faltered late. ROYAL INSIDER chased five wide through both turns and kept
on for a minor award. ITSTHATTIME stalked off the inside, exited the far turn three wide and weakened. DR. TROUTMAN hustled early from inside, went up
inside to take control around the first turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, headed at the three-eighths and gave way. OWNING steadied off
heels entering the first turn, raced along the inside then angled out on the second bend, came four wide into the drive and tired.

Footnotes
VANTASTIC stalked the pace from inside, waited for an opening leaving the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and was put to left-handed urging,
gained command with a sixteenth remaining and held the runner-up at bay. BEST CHANCE threw head and was off slow to begin, settled well off the pace,
given his cue with three-eighths remaining, swung five wide into the stretch, drew alongside VANTASTIC in the final furlong, dueled to the wire but could not
go by. EAST RAND unhurried in the beginning, lacked room past the quarter pole and upper stretch, tipped out mid-stretch and finished well for the show
honors. NERVES OF STEEL took control early, set the pace on the inside, met the challenge from C FALLS at the three-eighths, headed by that rival at the
quarter pole, fought back from inside and cleared approaching the final furlong but yielded in the final sixteenth. LIAR LIAR (IRE) stalked outside a rival then
between foes, raced two wide through the far turn and could not offer the needed response. C FALLS pressed the pace early, chased the pacesetter up the
backstretch, drew alongside nearing the far turn, dueled around the second bend and into the stretch, lost contact with a furlong to go and weakened. SEA
OF LIBERTY angled to the two path early, steered out and traveled four deep up on the backstretch, remained four wide to the lane and lacked a rally.
FOOTHILL traveled along the inside then moved out and went three deep on the backstretch, moved closer outside the top pair nearing the far turn, chased
three wide into the stretch and weakened. TWILIGHT RIDER steered to the rail early, raced well off the pace, angled out into the stretch and failed to
menace. FUEGO CALIENTE moved to the inside early, moved out on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch and proved no menace.
