Footnotes
HEIDI'S BACK broke sharply, tracked the early pace three wide, rallied in the stretch and drew clear late under mild urging. SECRET FORMULA was
unhurried early, rallied in the stretch, split horses and closed fast to be gaining. HELLS BELLS HELEN set the pace until the top of the stretch, was hooked
in mid stretch and held well late. GRINS N' WINS had good position early, lacked a late kick and went evenly. CONGRATS JENSEN raced close up for a
half, then gradually faded. CIRCLE WILL RUN allowed to settle on the inside, failed to menace. HYDRA'S HOPE was outrun. BEACH BABE was no factor.

Footnotes
CHIEF BUCKEYE dueled on the lead until the top of the stretch, shook clear in mid stretch and widened late under left handed urging. BEAT THE DEALER
was never far back early, angled out and rallied three wide in the stretch, finished well and was clearly second best. LITTLE BITA SMOKE pressed the
winner and weakened, late. VOLUME OF TRUST was bumped at the start and trailed, passed tiring rivals. BRILLIANTBENNY had good position early and
lacked a late response. SWEET EMPIRE dueled on the lead until the top of the stretch, then tired. AFLEET O ME was no factor. SWEET JILL'S JACK was
outrun.
