Footnotes
CAPA BELLA took command quickly leaving the chute, responded willingly to challenge from WICKED WIZZY, widened through the stretch and won easily.
FIONA BAY raced near the back of the pack early in the three path, chased four wide into the lane but was no match for the winner and finished clearly
second best. CUVEE TEE raced at the back of the pack and showed interest late. MISS DIRECTED outsprinted leaving the chute, raced in closest pursuit
through the backstretch and lacked a closing response when asked. WICKED WIZZY stalked the pacesetters five wide through the backstretch, moved up
menacingly near the three eighths pole to the leader and left nothing in reserve for the drive. LUCKY HALO raced four wide through the backstretch and
was outrun.

Footnotes
PREDESTINED emerged the leader leaving the chute, dueled inside of DOCSLASTJOKE through the backstretch, then responded to challenge from
SPIRIT RACER into the lane, edged away then drifted in under left handed encouragement in the final furlong and held under a late drive. SPORTSCARR
saved ground along the rail leaving the backstretch, launched a late rally inside and missed. SPIRIT RACER stalked the pacesetters from the three path,
moved up alongside PREDESTINED at the quarter pole to challenge the lead and weakened late. LORD STANLEY was six wide leaving the chute, cut the
corner into the far turn, shifted out into the stretch and passed tiring rival. SECRET MEETING chased wide through the backstretch, fanned five wide in the
turn, chased the leaders from the quarter pole and evened out. CUZ IM A DANCER trailed the field and failed to threaten. DOCSLASTJOKE contested the
early pace while two to three wide, was unable to keep pace with rivals nearing the quarter pole and yielded. MAJESTYS CUP rated off the pace from the
five path and tired early.

Footnotes
DANCE SHOES attended the pace from the rail, gained the lead into the far turn, raced clear into the stretch and drew off under a confident hand ride. GO
MAMA tracked outside, fanned four wide through the turn, rallied three wide outside of NO COLLUSION and inched clear for place honors. NO COLLUSION
rated just off the pace from the three path, was set down for a drive at the quarter pole, dueled through the stretch and relented second in the final strides.
CARAT'S SONG sat in range under a snug hold, shifted out into the lane and failed to threaten. PRECIOUS NOTES attended the pace from the two path,
dropped back leaving the backstretch and faded steadily. CIGARILLO tracked four wide early and tired.

Footnotes
TONY'S TAPIT fractious in gate, hopped leaving, raced six wide into the backstretch under a strong hold, was given cue near the quarter pole then drove
four wide into the stretch and edged away. BODEMONSTER trailed the field in the two path, rallied outside then was gaining late but was unable to stall the
winner. BANG ON raced four wide through the opening turn, sat in striking range from the four path, hustled on the final turn and finished evenly. SIR
MIEZIE led the field into the backstretch, was under a attack nearing the quarter pole, rallied determinedly between rivals, drifted in under right handed
encouragement and gave way. DEPARTURE sat in striking range under snug hold, cruised up alongside SIR MIEZIE in the backstretch, was unable to keep
pace with the field, checked in the stretch and yielded. DAD'S LEGACY stalked the pacesetter and lacked a closing response. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of DEPARTURE against the rider of SIR MIEZIE alleging inference in the stretch run was upheld. SIR MIEZIE was disqualified
and placed fifth for interference.

Footnotes
SHELTERED BAY loaded without the rider, broke alertly then contested the pace from the two path, responded willingly to looming threat from SHANNON'S
SECRET in the far turn, drew clear into the lane and was under steady pressure to the wire. SHE LIKES TO PARTY tracked inside, rounded the turn about
three wide, chased hard through the drive and was gaining late. BAKKEN THE SUN raced four to five wide leaving the opening turn, tracked outside, roused
at the quarter pole, angled to the rail and lacked the kick needed. QUEEN RHONDA raced at the back of the pack under a snug hold, saved ground on the
rail in the far turn and passed tiring rivals late. COUNT ON IT went three wide through the first turn, pressed four wide leaving the backstretch and faded.
SHANNON'S SECRET pressed from between rivals and left little in reserve.

Footnotes
GEM ALTA rated just of the pace from the three path, swept the lead at the quarter pole and drew clear. REY COLIMAN broke awkwardly from the gate,
tracked inside, rounded the final turn about four wide but was no match for winner in the stretch. RAIDEN raced five wide in second flight and bid steadily
through stretch for show. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed outside early and closed late. HARRY'S HAMMER raced four wide through the backstretch and
lacked a bid. MINSKY MOMENT showed the way into the backstretch, was overtaken at the quarter pole and stopped. MOROCCAN WARRIOR offered
little. SANTA FE TRAIL outrun throughout.
