Footnotes
MISS SUGARBAKER was away alertly, then was well rated letting the front runner go early, then made a three wide move on the far turn, hit the front
leaving the turn and drew off in the stretch while being ridden out. SMOOTH JUSTICE set the early pace while well clear by the half mile pole and on the
inside, then was headed by the winner leaving the turn and proved to be no match for that rival while lasting for the place award. LOOKIN ROYAL was
allowed to settle early and came three wide into the drive, found best stride late to just miss the place award and besting the rest. WICKED JUSTICE
chased the pace four wide and was empty in the drive. TRILOBYTE was reserved on the inside to leaving the quarter pole, swung out four wide for the drive
and had no response. KANGAROO TALK was allowed to settle on the inside and tired.

SPA CITY was three to four wide on the first turn, then stalked the slow pace four wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and took over leaving the quarter
pole, quickly drew clear by the furlong marker, then was shown the crop and then wrapped up to prove much the best. LEMON KICK was four wide into the
first turn, then tracked the pace four wide on the backstretch, made a five wide bid on the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second
best. LONTANI set a pressured pace three wide and weakened in the drive, bested rest. SOMETHING NATURAL was bumped at the start, then chased the
pace on the inside and weakened. ARRIVAL chased the pace between horses and tired. BLUERIDGE MOUNTAIN was reserved early towards the inside
and swung out five wide for the drive but offered no rally. MAN IN THE CAN vied for the lead on the inside and tired. VASARIANO was bumped at the start,
then was reserved three wide on the backstretch, swung out seven wide for the drive and had no response.

Footnotes
TROUBLED JUSTICE pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid entering the turn, then dueled for command to the furlong marker, dug in gamely
in the final furlong to prevail late under a drive. MILLION DOLLAR RED stalked the early pace, made a four wide bid on the turn to duel for command, then
had a long drive with the winner but was outfinished, good effort. BAKER'S MAN was well placed early, then raced behind the duel by the quarter pole,
swung out three wide for the drive and rallied mildly but needed more. PRADO'S PLAYBOY was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the drive,
ducked out under left handed encouragement, then was corrected right handed and moved in, then rallied well late. CONCRETE CHARLIE set a pressured
pace on the inside and then dueled for command before fading in the drive. FEVER TEMPLE was bumped at the start, then was reserved early, then was
three wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally. INDOCUMENTADO chased the pace on the inside and weakened. PURPLE SHIRT was hard held early
while reserved, then was four wide by the quarter pole and had no response.

SHORT SUMMER DRESS was away alertly and was soon clear to set the pace towards the inside, then remained clear leaving the turn, then dug in
gamely in the stretch moving out in mid stretch and held on gamely to prove best under a drive. LADY OF LUXURY was bumped at the start, then chased
the early pace four then three wide entering the turn, then was between rivals by the quarter pole while making a bid, fanned out four wide turning for home
but needed more late while holding on for the place spot. CARIMBA hit the gate at the start, then made a five wide run on the turn and was fanned out six
wide for the drive and was gaining late. TAP N SWAY chased the early pace and made a inside bid on the turn but flattened out the final furlong. DANCE
RHYTHMS was allowed to settle while two wide, then came four wide into the drive but had no rally. BOLD FIGURE stalked the early pace four wide then
weakened.

Footnotes
CHARCOAL stalked the pace three wide early, then moved in to draft behind the dueling leaders by the quarter pole, then eased out three wide leaving the
turn, waited for room leaving the three sixteenths pole, then when room opened up quickly split rivals leaving the furlong marker and drew clear to prove
best under a hand ride. MARK OF THE Z dueled for the lead two wide, then was in between rivals leaving the turn, then proved to be no match for the
winner while saving the place award. JAZZY TIMES dueled for the lead on the inside and faded in the final furlong, bested rest. NUCLEAR OPTION chased
the pace on the inside but lacked the needed rally. KEEPIN IT CLASSY pressed the early pace four wide then made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for
command, then drifted out nearing the furlong marker and weakened.
