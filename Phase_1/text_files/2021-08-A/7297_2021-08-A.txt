ME vied inside to the turn, drew off for a clear lead, drifted out through the stretch and held safely. RED CHARGER was off a step slowly, saved ground, bid
inside and finished second best. BARTOLOMEO was void of early speed, put in a steady effort and was along for show while no threat to the top two. TIM'S
BUDDY stalked to the turn, angled out for the drive, weakened and faded from contention. DELICIOUS trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. READY TO
FORGIVE vied two wide to the turn, dropped back and stopped mid stretch. Hand timed.
