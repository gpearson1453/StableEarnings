WHISKEY NOT WINE sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control
through mid-stretch and was fully extended to hold ALPINE HYPNOSIS safe late. ALPINE HYPNOSIS tracked the winner from the inside, angled out into
the stretch, bumped with TRUTH TO POWER, angled inside nearing the sixteenth pole and was gaining on that rival late. TRUTH TO POWER chased the
winner while racing three-wide, bumped with ALPINE HYPNOSIS nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late. HARBOR OUTLAW showed no
early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. MARCH ON LINCH was off slow, lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and did not reach contention.

SUDDENLY WINNING broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off through
the lane. UNSINKABLE MOLLY B lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy. IT'S
CURLIN TIME was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. GOLD ROSE settled off
the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a contending position but failed to gain late. CHARMANT E pressed the pace of the winner
while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. NOOSITA lagged and raced five-wide through the turn.

STAY IN GRACE was away in good order to stalk the pace of LADY CAMPBELL while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was
up in the closing yards. PLEASE ME was never far back while racing along the inside, remained inside for the drive, offered a bid with a furlong to run,
gained a brief lead and just missed. LADY CAMPBELL was away in good order then hustled along to opened a clear margin before going a quarter and
gave way through the final furlong. FORTUNE'S FREUDE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and
failed to sustain her rally. LINDA'S BALLET showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.

PRINCESS OF CAIRO was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run and quickly
drew off. COMPELLING SMILE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn, could no gain on the winner in the drive but was up for the place.
GALILETA sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was off a step slow,
showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with good late energy. KILLARNEY LASS raced off the pacesetters early, moved
five-wide through the second turn and finished evenly late. DAFFODIL SWEET chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going
three-quarters. SQUAN'S KINGDOM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. MS LYNN was void
of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not reach contention.

MY GRANDPA settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and was up in the closing yards.
TOGRANPASHOUSEWEGO was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. TIZ MANNY disputed
the pace from between foes and gave way through the final furlong. RENO ROY pressed the pace while racing four-wide for a half and gave way. ACTIVE
PASS was off a step slow, lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. NORSKI was void of earl speed, raced five-wide through
the turn and was not a factor. MONSTRODAMOUS raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

drive. CITY STEEL chased the winner while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. HOT ENCOUNTER settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn and lacked the needed rally. REGAZZE CAT showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace.
