Footnotes
CHAPPY'S BREEZE broke awkwardly, in hand along the three path, two path on the last turn, appeared blocked into the lane, altered out, responded and
rallied for the win. HURRICANE ALPHA saved ground, checked into the first turn, tracked after a half mile, challenged along the three path nearing the top
of the lane, took the advantage and then was no match late. LIAMS MAJESTY set the pace along the two path around the turns, was collared at the top of
the lane, battled and then failed to secure the place. E MOLINARI well placed along the two path, saved ground on the last turn with a chance and
weakened. DR. FLASH ducked out at the start, close up along the three path leaving the half mile pole, continued on that path into the lane and weakened.
NARCISSISTIC broke slow, ducked in slamming SWAMP WATER, four wide on the first turn and was done on the last one. SWAMP WATER broke slow,
slammed after that, three path on the turns and tired.

Footnotes
SMOOTH OPERATION away on top, showed the way along the two path around the turns, responded when asked and was ridden out. I LOVE JAXSON
broke sluggishly, tracked along the three path from the get go, lodged a bid outside but was no match late. SOCIAL MOBILITY tracked along the rail,
continued inside on the last turn, eased out some and finished well. RUN FOR BOSTON broke sluggishly, well placed along the three path, two path on the
last turn, angled out some and finished with interest. GEMLOVER lagged back, three path on the last turn and tired.

Footnotes
WHO IS JARETT stalked in hand early, three path on the turn, quickly found the front and drew clear to be ridden out. SMOKIN' ALONE bore out some into
the turn, four wide around it, angled wide and rallied. LORCAN well placed along the three path into the turn, four wide out of it and finished with interest.
DOUBLE D DAY never far back along the rail and weakened inside. THERESA'S BOY broke slow, two path into the turn, was not a threat. BUSS THE
BELL broke on top, showed the way along the two path, was collared and gave way.
