SHOP AROUND outrun early along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, knifed through between foes and inside a tiring rival turning for
home to challenge into the lane under confident handling, drew out under a light hand ride to win ridden out. SAFE KEEPING broke with the field, lacked
speed off the inside, asked along, fanned five wide into the lane, proved no match for the winner, clearly second best. TENSAS SUNDAY within striking
distance while racing in the second flight, fell back, dropped inside into the the lane, improved position to finish best rest. GRACE'S GAL in mid pack while
off the inside, four wide through the second turn, went evenly through the lane. KAITLYN'S COURT pressed the issue off the inside, gave way late in the
final turn. SUNDAY'S GIFT broke on top, set a soft pace along the inside, stopped in the drive. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS
HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

SOME WOULD SAY with the pace from the start inside, dueled through the turn remaining on the rail, shook off the other speed to be clear when
straightened for home, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. ROSE CROWN last to leave, raced back off the pace while saving ground early
in the turn, angled out to be three wide in to the lane, finished up willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late. TIZZY'S SONG forwardly placed early,
fell back steadily through the turn to trail into the lane, came again late with a belated rally to annex the show from between rivals. COOL SPRING void of
speed, passed a couple of tiring rivals while not a serious threat. SHE'S SEVENTEEN in the second flight while racing outside, came up empty for the
stretch run. MISS UNDERRATED pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled outside the winner through the turn and gave way when the real running
began at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
ACCUSTOMED TO HOPE broke on top, narrowly set the pace for a half under a light hold along the inside, disposed of the other speed in upper stretch
and drew out under pressure the final furlong. PEACEFUL VISION closest to the two leaders toward the inside and also under restraint, continued to save
ground turn, asked into lane, no match winner, clear for the place. LIL' SISTER LOU away in good order, pressured the winner from the outside up the
backstretch and into the turn, lodged a brief bid late in the turn, could not keep up in the drive nor contain the winner,comfortably saved the show. WILL B
LATE went one paced while racing three wide, lacked late punch. QUEEN GIGI last away, trailed for over a half, lost whip exiting the turn, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CLOCKED IN TYME made little impact from off the pace. RHETT'S RACER four wide through the
turn, tired through the stretch.

Footnotes
ECLECTIC SOUL broke on top, showed the way through the first turn toward the inside, continued to set an uncontested pace the middle half, drew out
steadily through the lane while being kept to task the final furlong. LIZZ A BEE last to leave, lacked speed toward the inside, two path when beginning to
improve late in the final turn, lugged in past the furlong marker, clearly second best while not a threat to the winner. SWEET AMELIA settled off the pace
and the inside, roused three wide turning for home, no match top two, along for the show. MISS MIRACLE GIRL prompted the pace along the inside,
continued to chase into the lane, gave way the final furlong. SUM NATION four wide into the first turn, continued to race back and outside, five wide into the
lane, failed to muster a rally. LUCKY HARBORAGE settled off the early pace, moved a bit closer while four wide late in the final turn, flattened out in the
drive. GOTTABEGOLDEN forwardly placed for a half, faltered. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
QUEEN NEFERTARI with the pace while three wide and between rivals, continued to vie into the turn, shook free of the other speed late in the turn, drew
off through the lane while feeling the crop until late. AKIANE'S SOLDIER last to leave, continued to trail early, advanced just off the inside late in the turn,
rallied from between horses upper stretch and finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a match for the winner. LIBERTY DIAMOND back off the early
pace, steered out to be five wide turning for home, improved position to prove best of the rest while remaining well out in the strip. IN FOR A PENNY broke
in, was straightened and moved up to contest the pace for just under a half while in the two path and between horses, weakened in the drive. OUR LITTLE
GIRL flashed speed for almost four furlongs as well closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. MY LOVELY CHARLIE with the pace while four wide,
continued in the four path turn, backed up through the stretch as well. CUSTOM MADE finished early to be never a threat.

Footnotes
OURPERFECTPRINCESS closest to the early leader from the outside up the backstretch, closed the gap on that one late in the turn, collared that same
rival past the furlong marker, edged clear under steady handling. HARRIET'S DREAM broke alertly, soon sprinted clear soon after, set the pace into the turn
along the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner in mid stretch then could not keep up, remained clear for the place. MY KIKI broke awkwardly to be
away slowly, raced back for a half, slipped through along the rail turning for home to improve position, came out to bother OUR MARDI GRAS slightly with a
furlong remaining, edged clear of that one for the show, no threat to the top pair. OUR MARDI GRAS in the second flight outside, three wide into the lane,
bothered slightly a furlong out, finished up evenly to come up empty. SHE'S MY PRIORITY remained back in failing to menace. HALF DIALED had nothing
for the stretch run.

Footnotes
MAGEEZ last away, void of speed, moved closer in traffic late in the final turn, made a hole through a narrow opening between horses past the furlong
marker, closed with good resolve to be up in time. POWER JET also lacked any early foot, advanced along the inside and slipped through along the rail to
reach contention entering the stretch, shifted out a bit and challenged between rivals late, outkicked. GET THEM JUSTIN with the early pace inside, dueled
the middle half while helping set some lively fractions, shook off the other speed to be clear when straightened for home, responded when the top two
challenged with a sixteenth remaining, proved stubborn to the end. DREWCITABLE settled off the pace and the inside, brushed midstretch, lacked a closing
kick. SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE away in good order, vied first turn between rivals, dueled through those quick fractions the middle four furlongs, first to blink
turning for home. WISE VERDICT settled off the pace, fanned five wide turning into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. STRONG RULES with the early
pace three wide first turn, was tiring when four wide exiting the final turn, continued to weaken to the wire. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT
WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
GOT KRAMER close from the start while between horses, dueled closest to the inside through the turn and into the lane, remained on equal terms with the
runner up past the furlong marker, extended duel to the end, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. PERFECT PERIGEE broke well, set or forced
the early pace off the inside, dueled through the turn outside the winner, continued through the lane, narrowly missed, clearly second best. MIDNIGHT
NIGHTMARE broke back, lacked speed, steady advance turn, steered out four wide into the lane, finished willingly to gain the nod for the show, not a threat
to the top two. POWERSHOT broke back, moved up in the run up the backstretch, four wide through the turn while continuing to advance, closest to the top
two a furlong out, flattened and was narrowly nipped late for the show spot. FIRST METAL COUNT within striking distance in the early going, fell back off
the top two late in the turn and proceeded in even fashion through the lane in lacking a closing punch. FLASHBURN in tight at the start to be last away,
lacked early foot, improved through the turn a bit and into upper stretch, was never dangerous. UNBELIEVABLE CATCH lacked speed, passed tiring rivals.
GOLDEN V C prompted the issue early from along the inside, gave way. GOLDEN NOGUEZ broke in, brushed with FLASHBURN, moved up to race in mid
pack early and began to fade before three furlongs. LAST APPEAL was finished early, trailed home.
