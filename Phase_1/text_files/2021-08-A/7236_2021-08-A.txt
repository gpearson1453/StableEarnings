MARY JACK went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, led throughout and won under steady urging, holding off a late running GOINGTOAGOGO.
GOINGTOAGOGO unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late bid, racing five wide and was gaining on the
winner. CARSON'S PRINCESS pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. BANKABLE raced in
the middle of the field, eased back, made a mild bid and was outfinished for show. SHACKS RIVER lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn,
moved up, within contention and hung down the stretch. GRAYGIRLGO pressed the early pace, raced three wide around the second turn and was finished
early. JEWEL STREET void of early speed and was never close RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

KING FORD unhurried in the early going, had an outside trip, made a rally down the final stretch six wide and proved the best at the wire. BEST LITTLE
MAN pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, came around the final turn three wide, was outfinished for the win, while putting forth a game effort.
LUCKY INFERNO lacked early speed, showed late interest, was no match for the top two, but got up for show. NETELA challenged for the early lead,
forwardly placed until late, faded down the home stretch. SENATOR CON went to the front, drove clear and lacked a finish. LUCKY STREAKER raced
within contention, saved ground and dropped back. MOSTA FLYIN always raced near the back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

an early factor, saved ground around the turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. ZELIG lacked early speed, made a
steady gain and proved third best. DESTINY WAY raced within contention, came around the turn three wide, came down the stretch wide and finished
evenly. JACK THE RIPPER (FR) went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. BAJAN CASH lacked early speed, came around the turn five wide
and was never a threat. PALVERA always raced near the back and was outrun. BLUEWATER CAT raced near the middle of the field in the early part,
dropped back and was no threat late. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
