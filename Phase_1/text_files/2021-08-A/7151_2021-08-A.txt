CLASSIC MAN dueled for the early lead, being challenged by CHARCO, took the advantage at the head of the stretch and pulled clear down the lane.
CHARCO vied for the early lead, saved ground, couldn't keep up with the winner late, but was a clear second. CREME DE BALI raced within contention,
came around the turn three wide, made a mild bid, couldn't the top two, but was best of others. WATSONS BAY void of early speed, improved position, but
was no factor. LUCK OF THE STARS raced evenly near the back and was never a threat. AS THUNDER HEART raced near the middle of the field in the
early part and weakened. COSTELLO'S KITTEN broke well, quickly dropped back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

SIR SMACK stalked the leaders in the early part, moved up around the turn, pulled away down the stretch and won under steady urging. BOGEY lacked
early speed, made a late bid, racing four wide, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HOLY SPIRIT raced in the middle of the field,
moved up, three wide around the turn, made a bid, racing behind SIR SMACK, but lacked a rally and couldn't hold off BOGEY for the place position.
DINNER AT CRUMPIES raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. DUSTY HILL showed early speed, drove clear, saved ground and tired. PULL
MY CHAIN pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn and dropped back.

WAR ROGUE unhurried in the early going, raced four wide around the first turn, moved up around the second turn, came in at the head of the stretch and
drove clear. JR'S SAUVAGE raced within contention, being reserved, bid final turn, angled out as WAR ROGUE came in and proved second best.
THIRTYSIX G'S lacked early speed, made a late rail bid and got up for the show. DOUBLE PRIORITY went to the front, drove clear and faded. POWER
SERVE void of early speed, raced outside around the final turn and was never a factor. ZION'S CALL pressed the early pace and made a steady retreat.
THE JOCKEY OF #5 JR'S SAUVAGE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #6 WAR ROGUE FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN THE HOME STRETCH.

factor, saved ground around the final turn, angled out down the stretch and proved third best. TREFOIL void of early speed, saved ground around the final
turn and passed tired ones. LIMITLESS MAZIE went to the front, took command and was finished early. DARLING JOANNA raced within striking distance,

GOTTA A. P. B. pinched back at the start, racing in the rear, made a steady gain, finished wide, pulled away and proved much the best. CAPTAIN NOBLE
bumped at the start, raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout, took command at the head of the stretch, but proved no match for the winner late.
OREGON COUNTY broke in sharply, went to the front, took command and weakened. KASENS TRAIN lacked early speed, raced evenly near the back and
was never a factor. HEAROSEONEASTER raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and weakened. BIG T bumped at the start,
vied for the early lead and dropped back. MORO SAVAGE always raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was no threat. RACE
