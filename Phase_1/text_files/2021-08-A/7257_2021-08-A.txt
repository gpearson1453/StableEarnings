continued off the rail on the turn, bid three wide approaching the stretch and missed third under steady urging. ANGEL OF THE CITY broke in, bumped
start, tracked leader along the inside, continued along the rail, dueled with rival in the stretch for third and edged out late. DOHENY BEACH settled off the
