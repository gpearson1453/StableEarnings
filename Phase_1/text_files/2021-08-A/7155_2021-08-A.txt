Footnotes
RIVERSIDE WALK (GB) rated on a clear lead, increased her margin through the turn, then drew off in the lane and was kept to the task. ABBEY'S SNOW
WHITE allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best of the rest.
BRIDGE DANCER well placed and between rivals, angled in and lost some ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
closed well for the show. GET SASSY stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and weakened the
final furlong. LIL HOOH'S HOOH well placed and three wide, angled in to the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the stretch and flattened out.
GOLDEN PEARL rated in a tracking position, lost some ground through the turn, then had no rally.

the final strides. BEARS BREECHES allowed to settle, looped up four and five wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane, made a steady
gain and missed. LADY MECHANIC mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, dueled in upper stretch
and evened out. SPIN CLASS never far back, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path, dueled in upper stretch and missed the show.
DOMINANT STRANGER sprinted to a long lead soon after the start, held sway to the late going and weakened. TREASURE THE STORM well placed and
outside, lost some ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane and ran evenly the final furlong. PRAIRIE CITIZEN improved
position. LA REINA DEL NORTE ran evenly for three quarters, then had no rally. MOMS LOVE well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, then

task. LA LA LAND (IRE) never far back, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then could not threaten the winner and
held the place. GOODIE GOOMER steadied into the first turn, tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch, then
lugged in and closed for the show. VINTAGE KITTEN allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane and
got up for a share. SUMMER PALACE well placed and outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
CONCEALED CARRIER mid pack, saved ground through the turns, angle out to bid four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up late.
DEPUTY OX never far back, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick.
STARE DECISIS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turns, came through inside steadying, then could not gain the final furlong. RATCHET sprinted
to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, shook clear, then weakened late and held a share. BOARDWALK BOB
allowed to settle, looped four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gain. SPROLES allowed to settle, saved ground
through the turns, came through inside of rivals and evened out the final furlong. MIO D' EVEN passed tiring rivals. TRAIN IN VAIN stalked the pace on the
outside and faded through the second turn. COMMANDER TRUMP allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the second turn, then had no rally.
BO RHAPSODY showed little. STORMBIRD'S SONG was no factor.
