GARNETS GAL attended the early pace, was settled on the turn, responded when called upon and edged clear in the stretch under a drive. FRUGAL
BETTY chased while three wide, remained three wide into the stretch and stayed on. CAVATICA dueled early, forged clear on the turn and was worn down
in the stretch. KALLISTE ROSE was outpaced while four wide and proved no factor. SINGING ALLI was always outrun. RIVER RAIN saved ground and
proved no factor. MUWAAN MAT showed little interest.

Footnotes
SHIP BOSS gained the early lead, edged clear into the stretch and held sway under vigorous pressure. ABOUT OUR TIME outpaced while four wide,
continued four wide into the stretch and finished well. KING DEUCE chased while three wide and lacked the needed bid. UNCLE CHAD outrun early,
commenced a bid on the turn and showed some late interest. JUSTA STREAK raced forwardly along the inside, was steadied when short of room at the
five-sixteenths pole and came up empty in the stretch. CHOOS UR ADVENTURE raced in striking position while four wide and came up empty in the
stretch. LARCH never menaced. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE WAS A BOTH A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A JOCKEY'S CLAIM OF FOUL
REGARDING AN INCIDENT ON THE TURN. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS DECIDED TO MAKE NO CHANGES TO
THE ORDER OF FINISH.
