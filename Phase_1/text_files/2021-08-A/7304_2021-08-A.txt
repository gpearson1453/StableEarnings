Footnotes
COLOR CHART three path on the first turn with the lead, showed the way two from the rail after that, opened up and then was ridden out while wrapping up
late for the score. WHISPERING ROSE unhurried along the two path, began to gain on that path around the last turn, angled out, chased and finished well.
SMART BROAD in tight early, trailed along the rail, swung out to the three path into the lane and finished with interest. SISTER PATRICIA tracked along the
rail for a half mile and then done on the last turn. Y'ALLCOMENOW unhurried along the three path around the turns and tired. BEL CUORE tracked four
wide into the backstretch, three path on the last turn and tired.

interest inside. ANOTHER IMAGE broke slow, well placed along the rail on the turn and weakened,. CLARICE tracked along the three path on the turn and
tired. SAILOR'S TREASURE unhurried along the two path and failed to take part. SAW four wide on the turn, was outrun. CHOSEN BY GRACE ducked in
