ONE NATION settled at the back of the field, began an outside rally after half a mile, moved clear near the quarter pole and drew away. MAYBE AFTER
LATER prompted the pace outside, led briefly on the final turn but proved no match for his winning stablemate. DIABLO D ORO chased in the two path and
lacked a solid rally. MIDLANER reserved inside the pacesetters, was asked for run on the final turn but had no response. COBBLE ROAD saved ground
well behind and gave way readily. LIAR SIDE CHAT set a pressured pace for half a mile and stopped abruptly.

went after the winner on the turn but was no match for the winner. SARGEANT DRIVE lacked speed, advanced inside on the turn while no threat.
WEEKEND IN COURT lagged far behind then caught a fading opponent. BOSTON LIGHT dueled between rivals early then stopped abruptly.

THORNY TALE stalked the leader, took over when ready at the three eighths pole and drew off handily. BARINGER SPRING settled well back, split rivals
and angled wide on the final turn and closed well. BUMPERDOO advanced outside on the final turn and continued willingly. KOAN set the pace along the
rail and weakened on the final turn. KINGSVILLE rated just off the leaders inside then proved empty in the stretch. CALL FITZROY lagged far behind and
lacked a response. JAMMINWITHBRANDON was close up three wide early then gave way readily.

rallied four wide on the turn and closed well too late. ROCKIN COWBOY vied briefly, drew clear on the turn and came up empty in the stretch. CLEAR
PROSPERITY dropped back early, angled out in the stretch with a mild bid. SMART ROYAL T was urged close up inside then began retreating on the turn.
THESE BLUES trailed early then passed fading opponents. ASK CHUCK broke a bit awkwardly and gave way readily. IRONBOUND forced the pace briefly
then faded on the turn. INKY DINKY DO raced outside in midpack and stopped abruptly.

SHEER FLATTERY stalked the pace outside, took over before a half mile and pulled away under mild urging. IYWAAN lacked speed inside, angled out into
the stretch and closed strongly too late. THEY SHOT SONNY raced close up between rivals, rallied on the final turn then flattened out. MOON GATE
WARRIOR settled three wide off the pace, bid on the final turn then tired. RISQUE REBEL hustled to the front inside and was finished after half a mile.
SACRAMENTO Q chased wide, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. NOBIZ LIKE JETBIZ lagged far behind and was always outrun. MY MAN ELVIS
was urged close up to the final turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
SWEET WILLEMINA prompted the pace outside, bid and led into the stretch and edged away while kept to a drive. BARISTA VIXEN saved ground close
up, to the stretch, angled out and closed well. SHESALITTLE EDGY held a measured lead inside to the stretch, was collared and tired. TONAL VISION
eased back and moved very wide on the final turn then offered a mild bid. LULA'S ROADRUNNER chased four wide off the leaders and flattened out in the
stretch. SOUTHERN CENTS raced close up between rivals for three quarters and faded. MINI SCOOP dropped far behind and was never in contention.
SHOOBIEDOOBYDOO ducked out at the start, angled near the inside and gave way.

SILVER EDGE close up between foes, angled out advancing into the stretch and edged away while kept to his task. START MEEE pressed the pace
outside, vied through the final turn and yielded in the stretch. ROAN MOUNTAIN settled inside, was asked for run on the final turn and had only a mild
response. CLASSIFIED INFO led inside under pressure and began fading at the quarter pole. END ALL GET ALL dropped far behind and passed fading
rival. UNBRIDLED JOHN prompted the leaders three wide and stopped after half a mile. GRAND OASIS lagged far back and trailed throughout.
GREENBACK was ordered a late scratch at the gate on the advice of the track veterinarian.
