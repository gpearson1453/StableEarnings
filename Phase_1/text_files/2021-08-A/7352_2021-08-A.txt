continued willingly. CAPTIVATING GAL raced close up between rivals, moved wide on the stretch with a mild bid. THEA'S THEME moved clear inside, vied
through the turn and weakened late. MELODIOUS SINGER raced wide throughout and proved empty in the stretch.

AWAY JOE angled three wide into the first turn, stalked the leader and continued willingly for the place. EVEN THUNDER set a measured pace inside, was
collared midway on the final turn then tired through the lane. TIVANO was sluggish outside early then offered some late energy while no threat. ECLIPSED
MOON dropped back inside early and steadily faded.

NO SABE NADA slow early, advanced three wide on the turn, bore out into the stretch, raced an erratic course through the stretch but pulled away
convincingly. DRAMA'S PRAYER led along the rail, was engaged from the outside, dueled on the turn and could not hold off the winner. MY HANDSOME
MAN dropped back early then closed the gap without menacing. SMARTHUMOR was urged off the leaders inside then began faltering on the turn. GREAT
ASSUMPTIONS rushed to contention outside, dueled on the turn, earned a brief lead then proved empty. KICK ROCKS KID chased wide and was always
outrun. SAPIO SOCIAL lacked speed and gave way readily.

HERE COMES MAGIC forced the pace outside, took over on the final turn, repelled a challenge and edged away through the stretch. PAPA JIMMY settled
inside, made a menacing rally into the stretch, was repelled by the winner but was easily second best. MY DANNY BOY firmly rated off the leaders then
closed willingly to earn the show. SOCIAL EQUALITY was in tight between rivals on the first turn, chased outside and was no factor. CONQUISTADOR
SHOW broke sluggishly, trailed inside and was never in contention. MY FREEDOM hustled to the lead inside to the final turn and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
SASSY BABE pursued the loose pacesetter, angled out into the lane and was up in the final yards following a long drive. LA FAMILIA quickly sprinted clear,
widened on the turn, fought back gamely when challenged but yielded late. HOT TO PARTY chased leaders inside and continued well while no threat.
KATS IN CHARGE lacked speed, moved inside and picked off rivals late. COCKTAILS AT EIGHT chased wide off the leaders and lacked a solid rally.
MIZSHIPMAN dropped back very wide and was never in contention. EMME ROO was urged close up in the two path, drifted out on the turn retreating.
JORDIN'S SURPRISE raced far behind throughout.

SAMMIE SUNSHINE dueled along the rail, took over near the three eighths pole then edged away through the stretch. THAT IS KEY rated inside, loomed a
threat into the stretch but could not get by the winner. WHAT ABOUT TONIGHT vied outside the winner to the stretch and weakened slightly. NANA'S
SHOES far back inside, moved wide on the final turn with a mild bid. HETTY G. chased between rivals down the backstretch then gave way. PENANCE
rated outside well off the pace and failed to menace. TINK was urged close wide into the far turn then faded.

INANNA'S QUEST very reluctant loading delaying the start, was firmly rated inside, angled out into the lane and drew clear as much the best. THREE
COINS fanned wide on the first turn, remained wide, angled inside in the stretch to gain runner-up spot. BOHEMIA BABE dueled outside to midstretch and
continued willingly to the finish. NAUGHTY NOTION alternated for the advantage inside and weakened slightly. BELLA BETTINA raced close up between
rivals then moved wide in the stretch and flattened out. FARCICAL far back early, was taken up sharply and bobbled on the final turn losing any chance.
DRINK THE TAP was urged close up three wide then began fading on the final turn. REMARKABLE LASS dropped back early and was always outrun.
