Footnotes
PURE PURSUIT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. ROCKET POWER was
reserved just off the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with a steady bid to gain the place. MR BINGLEY chased
the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. JIMJIMMYJAMES stumbled at the start, raced
unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BERNIE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not
reach contention.

in the drive. COASTAL WONDER was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the five-sixteenths pole and again
nearing the quarter and was eased through the lane. THE RIDER OF COASTAL WONDER LODGED AND OBJECTION CONCERNING THE STEADYING

Footnotes
DAVID NOSE BEST broke sharply to press the pace of LUCKENBACK while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the half, opened a
clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and held off the closing HAVEULOSTYOURMIND to prevail. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND raced unhurried early,
moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. LUCKENBACH was away alertly to set a
pressured pace, gave way to the winner after going five furlongs and stayed on well in the drive. PREACHINATDINNER lacked early speed, saved ground
through teh second turn and finished evenly late. RAPHAEL was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened.
COLAVITO hopped at the start, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

OUR LYLA GRACE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch, reached the fore soon after and drew
off with complete authority. JACANA lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further with a furlong to run and finished with good late
energy. OREO'S DREAM settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. LUTES LIL GIFT was away in good
order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear lead before going a quarter and gave way through the final furlong. BOTTLE NECK was squeezed back at the
start, lagged early, angled out approaching the stretch and did not threaten. COASTAL RUN was away alertly to press the pace while racing three-wide and
weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
CHRIS THE BEAVER sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his advantage into the lane and was fully extended
to hold INQUISITION safe late. INQUISITION was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, remained inside for the drive and
finished with good late energy. PRINCE OF LUCK broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide throughout and lacked the needed late
response. OFFICER OF WAR was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the dirve. KING CHARLIE showed no early
speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SMILE FOR ASHLEY hopped at the start, raced just off the leaders early, moved six-wide
through the turn and weakened.
