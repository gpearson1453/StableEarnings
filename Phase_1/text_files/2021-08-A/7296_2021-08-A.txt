STUNTING led throughout and kept to task in the drive. QUE TEE stalked the pace and gained ground on leader in the drive but was no match for the
winner. MIDNIGHT MADNESS raced in the middle of the pack then made a mild bid to be best of rest. NATIVE BLOOM chased the leaders from the two
path and weakened. SEATTLE TWIST was allowed to settle then made a mild bid on the inside but failed to menace. HANNAH'S STORM was not a factor.
RUN FOR RANDY broke through the gate before the start but was not a threat. OUR LADY BLING trailed the field throughout.
