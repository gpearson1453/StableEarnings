Footnotes
CINCY BELLE went evenly pressing up on the turn shaking clear in upper stretch widening to wire. KITTY EXPRESS slow early gave a mild rally on the far
turn angling out in upper stretch rallying to save place. SWEET LEAF slow early gave a mild rally on the far turn extending to upper stretch hanging late.
ORIENTAL LADY was in tight at the break lagging through the turn mustering a modest rally down the lane. QUIET DAWN stalked the pace pressing on the
far turn weakening in upper stretch. TEATOE played no factor. WIKI WOOD veered out crowding foes at the break, rushed clear was hooked on the far turn
wilting in upper stretch. FACTUM'S REWARD was bumped and crowded at the break, tracked the early wilting on the far turn.
