Footnotes
HONEY BELLA , prominent six wide in the opening stages, was urged to gain a clear advantage while angling inwards a bit nearing the turn, dictated the
pace on a comfortable advantage on her own courage racing through the turn, then came under firm right handed pressure to extend her margin to the end.
BAILOUT KELA, urged three wide between foes prompting the pace in the opening stages, continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner to the stretch
but proved only second best. SUMMER FIREFLYS, urged to contention four wide, then three wide between foes racing into the turn, finished evenly late.
SHEZONEZESTREET angled to the inside tracking just off the first flight racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and was just outkicked for a
share. SPEEDY ENOUGH was rated off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch while being
urged to advance but continued with an even effort. MY EAS Z RIDER, off slowly, was urged five wide, then four wide racing into the turn to gain terms with
the second flight but flattened out in the drive. ANNIE M settled between foes in early stages and offered no rally. MINKOTA JOY proved no factor. LOCK IT
DOWN ducked inwards at the start while getting away slowly, switched outside rivals racing to the turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GOPHER, urged to terms with the leaders three deep prompting the pace to the backstretch, pressed the issue outside a rival nearing upper
stretch, drifted out under pressure nearing the furlong marker but continued with a steady effort to narrowly prevail between foes on the wire. HUNTER'S
MAGIC tracked off the first flight outside a rival to the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the far turn while being prompted to advance, switched outside
the drifting pacesetter with an abrupt move to bid in the four path leaving midstretch and continued willingly to close the gap while narrowly prevailing for the
place honors. NOTE PAD settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide racing into the lane gathering late momentum, altered
course in traffic leaving the furlong marker to bid inside the top pair and continued with a steady late bid to just miss for second. LEFT OF CENTER,
reserved near the inside racing to the far turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and made an effort to improve position. ANNIE'S SHENANIGAN was
rated tracking off the first flight in the opening half, switched out racing into the far turn and had no closing bid. CANTERBURY GOLD, urged inside foes
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage in the opening stages, dueled inside foes into the far turn, then through the stretch and gave out late.
MOONSHINE MOXY, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LESLIE'S GOLD, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, shifted out racing through the stretch gaining a narrow advantage and
edged away under pressure. VEGAS GUY broke readily, forced the pace outside the eventual winner racing into the turn, was floated out racing through the
stretch and weakened in late stages. NEW DICE, bumped, then squeezed back while clipping heels just after the start, settled well off the leaders and
displayed some late interest to improve position between foes. TWISTED DIXIE broke inwards bumping NEW DICE, shifted to the inside racing into the turn
and continued evenly. MOVER, off slowly, then carried out at the start, was prompted to regain position between foes racing into the turn and flattened out
nearing midstretch. ARCTIC RIDGE ducked out at the start and dropped out early. BAYOU COLONEL broke out bumping NEW DICE at the start, was
righted, then shifted out three wide in early stages while being prompted to brief contention, emptied out nearing the lane.

Footnotes
WITHHERBOOTSON, urged inside rivals disputing the pace, dueled into the far turn, shook clear racing through the stretch and was kept to firm
encouragement. SUNDANCE STAR broke readily, was eased off the pace to track off the first flight near the inside, shifted out to bid three wide racing into
the lane and edged a rival for the place honors. SURELY A LEGEND, urged between foes to force the pace outside the eventual winner to the backstretch,
dueled for command into the far turn and gave way in the drive. TIMBER LADY settled last early, was urged to advance five wide racing into the far turn but
had no final kick. SHE APPEALS HOLY, caught a bit wide into the first turn, proved no threat. FIREMAN'S LIL SIS, caught five wide racing to the first turn,
angled inside on the backstretch and steadily faded. POPPIN TOPS flashed brief pace three wide between foes and emptied out after a half. HOLY SOUL
made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide between foes into the first turn and emptied out early.

Footnotes
JOHAN ZOFFANI (IRE) was rated off the first flight a bit off the inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing upper stretch, edged forward
between calls late and held the late challenge of MARK IN GREELEY under firm encouragement. The latter was settled in the last flight switching outside
foes racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide nearing the lane and found his best stride late to close the gap. DOODLE TIME tracked off the first flight
three wide in the opening half, advanced in that path on the far turn to challenge for command in the lane but had no final kick. WILLTOBELUCKY tracked
off the second flight outside foes and continued evenly between foes to late stages. STAR OF STARS settled inside rivals early, saved ground to the lane,
then split foes to make some belated progress. MY GOLDEN BOY, urged inside rivals prompting the pace, faded after a half. GAINER, urged between foes,
then along the inside prompting the pace, dueled to midstretch and gave way late. GRAPHYTE settled between foes and failed to menace. RYE HUMOR
settled outside a rival in the last flight early and never menaced. WHERE'D THE DAY GO, urged three wide prompting the pace to the backstretch, gave
way into upper stretch.

LOVE THE NEST broke readily, tracked the pacesetter outside rivals in the opening stages, angled inwards racing into the turn prompting the pacesetter
through the bend, took over racing into upper stretch and went well clear late under firm hand urging. BENS MALICE was settled between foes racing to the
turn, angled out five wide in upper stretch and found his best stride late to prevail for the place honors. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY broke sharply, sprinted clear
while angling to the inside, dueled for command through the turn and weakened in the drive. HUNTER JUMPER, forwardly placed along the inside in the
opening stages, switched outside the leaders entering the turn and faded in the drive. DIRECT ACTION, pulling between foes early, shifted out four wide
racing into the lane and continued with an even effort. NORTH ARM BAY tracked the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, was caught in tight
quarters racing into upper stretch, shifted out to race between foes but had no rally. THAT'S NOT FUNNY broke awkwardly, was urged pursuing the leaders
three wide between foes into the turn and came up empty in the drive. HONEY'S SUPERMAN settled inside foes in early stages and failed to menace.
MINNESOTA RED, urged along the inside pursuing the leaders into the turn, emptied out racing into upper stretch. SMART OXIE, off last, was going

WILLING TO BURN, forwardly placed stalking just off the first flight racing to the backstretch, gained position along the rail nearing upper stretch, then came
through inside foes to edge GIVEITSOMEWELLIE in time under firm encouragement. The latter, off slowly, was prompted to make a steady gain between
foes racing through the backstretch, drew into striking distance nearing upper stretch while shifting out four wide, then continued willingly in that path to just
miss. WESTERN BERLIN, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset to the far turn, dueled between foes into upper stretch and weakened late.
NORTH OF EDEN settled in the last flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, steadily gathered momentum switching off the inside nearing
the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. LILA'S LUCKY LADY settled outside foes, was
fanned five wide into the lane and passed tiring rivals. MISS BROOKSIDE settled along the inside early, saved ground to the lane and made some belated
progress inside foes. DUSTY PRINCESS settled last racing to the backstretch and never gained contention. TEQUILA MARY switched out three wide
tracking the leaders in second flight to the far turn, then faded into the stretch. EVERYBODY DOES IT worked her way to the inside early but offered no
rally. SILVERA, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, gave way midstretch. DOUBLE BEE STING was urged three wide
pressing the pace from the break to the far turn and gave way between foes in upper stretch. Y NOT SIZZLE tracked off the first flight along the inside to the
backstretch and retreated early.

Footnotes
CANDY PRINCE broke well from the gate, dueled for the lead on the inside into the bend, continued to battle for command to the top of the lane then dug in
under firm left handed urging, drifted out slightly during the last sixteenth while bumping with PRINCE RAMA and prevailed on the wire. PRINCE RAMA
broke well, dueled three wide for the lead into the turn, took a minimal advantage at the top of the stretch to the sixteenth pole but was hand ridden through
the lane until the final few jumps where he got minor right handed encouragement but was outfinished. WESTONS WILDCAT dueled for the lead between
foes, battled to the top of the lane but failed to match strides with the top two in the final furlong but held on for show while under steady right-handed
encouragement. SILVER DASH was squeezed back after being bumped from both sides at the start then tracked the dueling pacesetters on the inside,
shifted out at the quarter pole then continued to move five wide at the three sixteenths and finished evenly through the lane. GOLDEN GULLEY tracked
three wide down the backstretch then angled six wide at the top of the stretch and failed to rally late. GONE A LIL LU HU was unhurried on the inside early,
continued inside through the bend and passed tiring foes in the lane. MAGICIAN'S HOLIDAY lacked early speed out of the gate then moved up to chase the
pacesetters three wide through the bend but failed to threaten in the stretch. JOHNNY UP dueled four wide in the early going then faded off the turn. WORN
A BIT trailed throughout and was eased late in the stretch.

Footnotes
BAYOU GEM broke well, forced the pace three wide into the bend, took the lead from SILVER RATIO nearing the sixteenth pole and prevailed while under
steady urging throughout the stretch drive. MISTER K broke well from the gate, led briefly before ceding command to SILVER RATIO at the half mile pole,
tracked the pacesetter on the inside through the bend, put to a drive at the top of the lane then shifted out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished willingly
while gaining on the winner to the wire. WARRIOR BOSS tracked the pace on the inside early, shifted out three wide nearing the quarter pole and gained
mildly to earn the show. SILVER RATIO was hustled between foes to take command down the backstretch, led through the bend but failed to match strides
when challenged by BAYOU GEM at the top of the lane and weakened in the stretch. CHICKEN TRUCK lacked early speed out of the gate, settled back
four wide, and passed tiring foes in the lane to earn a minor share. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM settled between foes in the early going and proved no threat late.
EXCURSION lacked speed out of the gate, trailed and proved no factor late. HAPPY HOUR COWBOY tracked between foes early then steadied slightly
nearing the half mile pole and failed to menace in the lane.

Footnotes
RUBY'S RED DEVIL was reserved through the opening bend while saving ground, improved position from the three eighths to the quarter pole then was
blocked multiple times between the three sixteenths and the furlong marker, shifted out late and rallied to get up just in time. SHAKELAS DESTINY was
allowed to settle midpack through the first half then commenced a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over the lead in the final sixteenth but was
outfinished late and had to settle for place. ME AND ROSE tracked midpack in the early going, shifted out three wide at the half to avoid GOLDIE'S
REVENGE retreating on the rail, commenced a three wide bid at the five sixteenths pole and was outfinished in the lane. ROVERTON broke well, led briefly,
attended pace on the rail, shifted out at the three sixteenths, bumped with rivals midstretch but had no late kick. GUEST CHECK chased the early pace on
the outside and weakened in the stretch while under steady urging. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE forced pace three wide early, led to the furlong marker and
gave way in the lane. GOLDIE'S REVENGE showed brief early speed on the inside then stopped.
