the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. GOLDEN G saved ground around the turn disputing the pace and gave way in the drive. ZIP THE LIP hugged
the inner rail and lacked the needed rally. PRICEY VICTORY , outrun, drifted very wide entering the stretch. BOB MAN lightly bumped with WHERE U B
leaving the starting gate, raced two wide on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
YESTERDAYSPLAN , in a bit close at the break, regrouped and was taken four wide, moved up outside rivals heading past the five eighths, sat patiently
four wide tracking the leaders leaving the five sixteenths, bid five wide soon into the lane, responded when set down soon after and pulled away while kept
alert. MISDRIVEN eased off the rail nearing the backstretch, rated forwardly while three wide, took closer order into the far turn, waited between runners
past the five sixteenths, altered wide for the drive, made a run past the furlong grounds, flattened out late but did manage to save the place. LIFE IN FLASH
, taken to rate off the pace, edged up two wide near the far turn, dropped in some to advance inside foes leaving the three eighths, got through along the rail
in upper stretch and continued with interest. SHAK'S HIDDEN GEM pulled her way three wide to contention after a quarter mile, prompted the pace outside
ARBUTUS, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, fought on past the three sixteenths then faded. LETMESLIDEBYYOU , taken to rate while
saving ground into the backstretch, angled out leaving the far turn, circled into the lane but lacked a serious response. ARBUTUS vied three wide outside a
rival early then kicked clear, dropped in to set the pace, was taken on while in the two path into the lane, kept on willingly past the three sixteenths then
weakened. SUSI SOLE saved ground stalking the pace, was under pressure into the far turn, failed to kick on and gave way.

Footnotes
CURLEE FOX set a pressured pace while under rating and towards the rail, went clear nearing the far turn, was then joined by SEVILLE ROW leaving the
far turn, put away that rival and kicked back away mid way on the final turn, eagerly kept on past the furlong grounds and was under steady hand
encouragement to the wire. GOLDIE'S BOY was well handled early and dropped in the secure the rail in the opening three sixteenths, edged up under
rating and tracked past the five eighths, briefly steadied into the far turn, stayed inside to give chase past the five sixteenths, eased out for the final furlong
and kept on with good energy though second best. STRIKING IT LUCKY , between runners while close up past the three quarter pole, drafted back some
through the backstretch, checked when in close around the far turn, angled out to circle five wide and came back on with interest to get the show. SENOR
SEVILLE saved ground early, eased out and moved up three wide past the five eighths, chased three wide into the lane but came up empty. SEVILLE ROW
, four wide into the first turn, stalked three wide through the backstretch, bid to threaten to the winner leaving the far turn, could not match strides past the
five sixteenths, have hard pursuit into the lane and faded. BUSSTER VON TRAPPE , allowed to settle, saved ground while making a mild run mid way on
the final turn, eased out in the drive but lacked a solid finish. FUSED , two wide outside the winner pressing the pace, failed to keep up leaving the far turn
and retreated. MO AMERICAN was outrun.

Footnotes
ARMANDO R lacked speed, was in the two path on the far turn, angled to the inner rail in upper stretch, closed strongly, led late and drew off. INSPECTOR
FROST set the pace in the two path, opened up on the far turn, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and tired late. INK , four wide both turns, was well positioned
turning for home and flattened out. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME , along the inner rail most of the race, failed to be a factor. JACKIE A stalked the pace down the
backstretch, was fanned five deep at the head of the stretch and failed to rally. SPEIGHTSTER RED showed speed along the inner rail and weakened.
SHANGHAIED ASTORIA , along the inner rail most of the race, was not a factor. LAW OF THE LAND , three wide both turns, checked in traffic leaving the
far turn and was eased.

angled five wide into the lane, leveled off under stout handling, rolled past rivals from the outside, took command late and won going away. HELLO AMIGO
prompted between foes early, stalked inside mid turn, eased out and advanced between foes past the furlong grounds, shifted back in late and kept on
gamely to earn the place. PREMIERE CHOICE veered in start, corrected and was taken to rate early while three wide, advanced four wide into the lane,
shied when in a bit of a close spot in deep stretch then kept on willingly to nab the show. BILLINGSGATE stalked three wide, moved to engage the leader in
upper stretch, shook clear past the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. IRISH SNOW steadied leaving the gate, settled off the pace, split rivals
around the turn, swung five wide, ranged up nearing mid stretch, drifted in then kept on trying after correcting. HE'S A SHOOTER , forwardly while saving
ground, was under rating mid turn, altered out near mid stretch and continued with interest. BADGER TOOTH edged up early while saving ground, was
steadied along into the turn, swung out for the drive and came up empty. LOOKATLITTLEFERRIS quickly went clear, dropped in and set the pace, was
collared soon into the stretch, kept on to about the eighth pole then surrendered. CALL ME MAESTRO broke slowly, raced off the pace, steadied off heels
near the quarter pole and faded.

MCELMORE AVENUE set the pace slightly off the rail, drifted out a bit entering the stretch while well clear, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and held sway
under encouragement. HANALEI'S HOUDINI stalked the pace, circled the far turn three wide, advanced to mid stretch and flattened out. COAL TRUTH ,
outside the winner, chased that one for six furlongs then weakened. BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL , along the inner rail most of the race, was not a factor.

Footnotes
ATREYU cleared early, dropped in and controlled the pace, opened up in mid stretch and won under a mild drive. CHOO CHOO , in the clear early, came
under pressure three wide leaving the far turn, circled into the lane and continued willingly to be second best. CAPTAIN THUNDER saved ground stalking
the pace, eased out a bit past the quarter pole, altered back in but lacked a serious response. TUSK stalked off the rail and under a light hold, was put to
pressure nearing the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. POSTERITY , pinched back at the break, raced three wide around the first
turn, angled five wide for the drive but lacked a rally. BELTWAY BOB , in the clear leaving the five eighths, came four wide for the drive and failed to
respond. LUDICROUS MODE bore out at the break, saved ground and failed to menace. THANK YOU RICKETTS was outrun.
