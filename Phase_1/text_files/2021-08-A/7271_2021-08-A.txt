Footnotes
PARTY AT PAGE'S set the pace along the rail, was headed at the top of the lane, cleared a furlong out and was under the whip while drifting out late for the
win. FLEETA BELLE unhurried four wide, four wide into the lane and rallied wide. SWEET SHALLOTS tracked along the three path, challenged three
across at the top of the lane, chased and finished with interest. LET'S MAGA tracked, challenged from between at the top of the lane, battled briefly, chased
and weakened. TRIPP ROAD unhurried along the two path, angled four wide into the lane and failed to rally from well out in the strip. MAD FOR FAME
three path into the turn, five wide out of it and failed to rally while wide. CROSSING ALASKA fractious just as the gates opened, broke awkwardly spotting
the field four lengths and then was outrun. BECCA TAKES CHARGE two path on the turn and failed to threaten. CLARA'S GONE WEST saved ground
tracking early and tired.
