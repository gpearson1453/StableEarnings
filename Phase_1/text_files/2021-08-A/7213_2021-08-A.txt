Footnotes
DADDY'S JOY raced close up three wide to the stretch, finished determinedly outside PIPER, and got past that one through the closing yards. PIPER set
the pace inside, dug in through a long drive and yielded grudgingly. R LOVE ON THE RUN pressed the pace two wide to the stretch, weakened and saved
the show. TURN IT ON was outsprinted three to four wide for three furlongs, and offered a mild response on the far outside. RUBY LEE lacked the needed
response three wide. KAY'S PROJECT was outrun early, and passed tired horses on the rail. AUBURN was never prominent. MISS LAMARR faded inside
after three furlongs. ONE SLICK FACT was always far back. QUEEN DOMINA was no factor two wide. MADAME BARRISTER raced four wide, and tired
leaving the turn. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED, FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE IVY was unhurried for six furlongs, came three wide off the far turn, rallied smartly past the eighth-pole and drew clear late. TRANQUILLINA
saved ground in the second flight to the top of the stretch, lodged a bid between horses through the furlong grounds just inside CHAMPAGNE IVY, and was
outkicked by that rival. MARIA'S REVENGE trailed to the far turn, fanned widest into the stretch and finished with good energy. FREE DATA pressed the
pace three wide, took over outside LOVE MY JOB coming to the quarter-pole, stayed on to midstretch and gave way. VENTRILOQUIST bumped with
BETTABE SWIFT after the start, went to the first turn keyed up behind horses, stayed in range two wide to the end of the far turn, and faded. LOVE MY JOB
pressed the early pace between horses, and tired after six furlongs. BETTABE SWIFT bumped with VENTRILOQUIST after the start, steadied behind that
same foe approaching the first turn, and tired into the stretch four to five wide. KULTHUM set a pressured pace to the far turn, and gave way before
reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
SHARM EL SHEIKH grabbed the lead with an alert beginning, rated along through an even pace inside, and stayed clear on his left lead through the lane.
FIG JELLY pursued the pacesetter from outside throughout, and could not make a dent in the margin late while clearly second best. ALL GOOD saved
ground on the turns in midpack, moved out for the drive and could not seriously menace with an even finish. HIGH NOON RIDER was slow into stride, raced
three to four wide at the back for six furlongs, and improved on the far outside without threatening. MITZRAYIM delayed the start difficult to load, chased
three wide outside the leaders for six furlongs, and faded. MR TITO'S raced three wide early, moved inside for the stretch run and could not gain. BRAY
broke slowly and was never prominent. PHILO was bothered behind POSITIVE PHIL midway on the first turn, and never reached contention. POSITIVE
PHIL got out badly through the first turn while becoming increasingly rank, dropped far back very tough to handle into the backstretch, moved in
approaching the far turn, and remained in arrears.

Footnotes
KING CAB broke slowest, rushed through between horses early, took over outside ONE MORE SCORE and went clear entering the turn in the two-path,
moved to the rail for the drive and remained in command under pressure. AWESOME CRUSADER was outsprinted early despite urging, shifted off the
inside to the three-path approaching the stretch, and finished with good courage to overtake SPUNTACULAR from outside for second. SPUNTACULAR
bobbled and bumped into ADVENTURE SEEKER at the start, chased three wide to the stretch, and was outfinished for the place. THE GREEN
CRUSADER raced four to five wide around the turn, and improved mildly on the far outside for the last major share. THE SKIPPER TOO brushed with THE
MAR at the start, raced two wide around the turn at the back, and improved position without becoming a factor. SPACE RUNNER shifted out four wide after
a half-mile, and faded into the lane. THE MAR broke out brushing into THE SKIPPER TOO, and could not reach contention two wide. ONE MORE SCORE
led early inside, could not keep pace with KING CAB into the turn, and retreated. MACHINEGUNPREACHER was slow into stride, and remained outrun
inside. ADVENTURE SEEKER got bumped by SPUNTACULAR at the start, and was through early outside. SOCIAL REVOLUTION was bumped by
ADVENTURE SEEKER at the start, raced three wide and dropped far back after a half-mile. NERVE retired early three wide.

Footnotes
DRAPES prompted the pace two wide, took a narrow in upper stretch, dueled outside of JABUTICABA past the eighth pole then drove clear. JABUTICABA
came a bit and bumped HELPING LISA D at the start, set a rated pace a bit off the rail, led to upper stretch, fought on inside of the winner past the eighth
pole, angled out when that foe cleared and held clear of the rest. BIENVILLE STREET tracked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane to
hold third. SPEEDY SOLUTION steadied near the three-quarter poles, advanced inside down the backstretch, was in range inside around the far turn and
lacked the needed rally. ZARINA saved ground well back, angled out nearing the eighth pole and had a mild gain. QUEEN OF GOD failed to menace while
racing two wide. ONYX steadied near the three-quarters pole, raced mostly inside and never threatened. LOVELY LUVY played no factor while racing three
and four wide. HELPING LISA D was bumped at the start and played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
PENS STREET broke out into MISZLO, stalked outside PERSPIRE to the turn, poked a head in front with a quarter-mile remaining, and edged clear under
pressure leaving the furlong grounds. PRINCESS BETTY had aim outside the leaders into the turn, came under a ride near the five-sixteenths, could not
reach PENS STREET but ran on to go clear of the others. OUR FANTASY raced two to three wide around the turn, and lacked a solid closing response
while able to get up for the show. PERSPIRE set the pace near the inside, could not withstand PENS STREET after six furlongs and yielded through upper
stretch. MISZLO got bumped by PENS STREET at the start, and saved ground to no avail. TEN PIN ALLY raced three wide, and dropped far back through
the stretch.

Footnotes
HARDLY SOCIAL stalked the pace inside, split rivals in upper stretch, struck the front near the eighth pole and powered clear. BLAZINONBAYOU prompted
the pace two wide around the turns, bid three wide in upper stretch but was no match for the winner in the final furlong. UNMARKED MONEY saved ground
off the early pace, advanced three wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. TONALA raced two and three wide in midpack and was one-paced
through the stretch. B C BELLE set the pace along the rail to upper stretch and tired through the lane. FABIOLA PRINCESS chased the pace two wide,
angled four wide nearing the lane and faded. KAMALA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. PRINCESS KYLISE was outrun inside. SIGNING
BONUS had early speed inside and steadily faded. LEARNT was outrun while saving ground early and going four wide around the far turn. SEGOVIANA
hesitated at the start, raced three wide and made little impact. DOITTOGETHER got out entering the first turn, dropped far back while racing far off the rail.
