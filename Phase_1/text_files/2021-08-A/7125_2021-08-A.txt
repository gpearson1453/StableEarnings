Footnotes
FOREST CARAWAY tracked off the rail then angled in leaving the backstretch, ranged up from inside and drew alongside past the quarter pole, quickly took
control then kicked clear in upper stretch and drew away. BIG SWEEP chased between early then outside rival turn, entered the lane three wide and
finished willingly for the place. QUEENGOL raced at the back near the inside, exited the turn a bit off the rail, remained along the inside in the lane and was
along for the show. LIVINGMYBESTLIFE set the pace in the two path, collared by the winner past the quarter pole and weakened. LIV AND LET LIV chased
from outside early on, went five wide into the turn then angled in and lacked room at the three-eighths pole, drifted five wide into the lane and came up
empty. JUST DISTORTED broke out a bit, closest in pursuit outside the leader, chased three wide into the turn, dropped back and drifted five wide into the
stretch and tired. HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA was off a bit slow to begin, stalked the top pair from inside, remained patiently handled on the turn, tipped outside the leader at the eighth pole
and overhauled the runner-up. TIME TO PARTY set the pace under pressure from outside, shook free at the three-sixteenths, came out a bit at the eighth
pole and yielded in the final sixteenth. URBAN got bumped hard and dropped back early, chased in the two path to the stretch, angled out and summoned a
mild late bid. NO LIMITATION broke a bit slow, stalked between rivals, came four wide into the stretch, got floated out mid-stretch, bumped at the sixteenth
pole and kept on for a minor award. DOUBLE THE GOLD pressed the pace from outside, chased between on the turn, exited the bend three wide, got
bumped at the sixteenth pole and weakened. ROY C came away a bit slow, lacked early speed, moved to the inside, angled out into the stretch and never
made an impact. BOMBS AT COCAL lugged in and bumped rival soon after the start, lost a shoe early, chased outside rivals, three deep into the turn, three
to four wide around the bend, drifted in and bumped rivals on both sides at the sixteenth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
NEW DRAMA hustled to the front from inside, cleared approaching the seven-sixteenths, inched away around the turn and lasted at the wire. ZERO
TOLERANCE came away to an awkward beginning, checked off heels soon after, angled to the inside, saved ground on the turn, shifted out and bumped
rival at the three-sixteenths, angled out late while closing fast and just missed. BOWL OF CHERRIES chased along the inside through the turn and into the
stretch, finished well up the inside and proved a game third. M IS FOR MAGIC tracked off the rail, got floated out into the stretch, moved out further and
finished with a mild late bid to round out the superfecta. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) chased outside a rival, three wide into the lane and finished evenly.
CHRISTMAS DIAMOND (GB) chased on the inside then a bit off the rail leaving the turn, got bumped into the stretch and kept on through the lane. KALON
traveled in mid-pack early, checked past the seven-sixteenths pole, angled four wide into the lane, kept to task in the drive but failed to threaten. BRAZILIAN
SECRET (IRE) showed early speed outside the winner, chased that rival past the seven-sixteenths, went two wide around the bend and weakened.
PEQUENA TORMENTA settled off the pace, traveled in the two path, swung five wide into the stretch, angled back inside in upper stretch and was never a
factor. JUBILEE LAKE (GB) saved ground and never got involved.

AFTERNOON HEAT settled off the pace, swung five wide leaving the turn, angled out widest in the drive, produced a late rally and got up for the place.
RINSE AND REPEAT chased off the pace and moved inside, remained along the fence into and down the stretch, went willingly through the final furlong
and got outkicked for the place. BOB'S SNIPER tracked the top trio well off the inside, went five wide around the turn and finished evenly. REEDLEY dueled
for the lead from outside up the backstretch, vied between foes around the turn and into the stretch, fought to the eighth pole and weakened. LUCKY RYAN

in the stretch. ROYAL SEEKER sat off the pace in the beginning, took the turn two wide, steered out in the stretch and could not rally. REDACTION threw
head and was off slow to start, traveled along the inside into the turn, angled off the rail and came three wide into the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
INTO TOURING off a bit slow to begin, angled down to the two path and settled outside a rival, advanced into the far turn, angled five wide into the stretch,
rallied inside the leader in deep stretch and drew clear late. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE vied three deep into the first turn, pressed outside to the second bend,
dueled through the turn then drifted four wide into the stretch, cleared in upper stretch but yielded in the final sixteenth. VERY SCARY tracked three deep
early, raced outside a rival into the far turn, angled out then got carried five wide into the stretch, evened out in the late stages and held the show. A
CROWN FOR KITTEN off a step slow, raced outside a rival at or near the back of the pack, moved closer up the backstretch, angled six wide leaving the far
turn but could not find more in deep stretch. VIOLET STORM fought the rider soon after the start before settling into stride, steered to the inside while racing
near the back, moved out on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted back inward in the lane and kept on to move up. BABY'S DREAM stalked
the pace between foes, entered the stretch two to three wide and flattened in the final furlong. BEACHGRASS traveled along the inside, shifted two wide
into the stretch and lacked further response. BURROW DOWN angled to the inside early, angled out around rival at the three-eighths, went two wide into
the lane and failed to menace. PRECIOUS INSIGHT vied for the lead between rivals, took over at the half-mile pole, dueled on the far turn, fought to the
stretch and folded. SCAM LIKELY sped to the front, vied for the lead from inside, started to weaken leaving the backstretch, dropped back around the turn
and tired.

at the top of the stretch, angled back inside and missed the show. IN VRONSKY STYLE stalked the pace between foes into and around the bend, tipped out
in upper stretch and missed the show. NICHIREN stalked outside a pair of rivals, came four wide into the stretch and flattened inside in the furlong grounds.

at the start, chased outside rivals, three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. STIR THE POT broke alertly then dueled from outside, battled around the turn
and gave way. THISMUSTBETHEPLACE brushed from outside at the start, chased off the rail, between foes into the turn, three wide around the bend and

SHEDARESTHEDEVIL stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, crept closer on the backstretch, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, took over at the quarter
pole, kicked clear approaching the furlong grounds and drew away. VENETIAN HARBOR sped to the front and cleared early in the two path, gained
pressure from PAIGE ANNE at the half-mile marker, turned away that foe at the seven-sixteenths, fought with SHEDARESTHEDEVIL on the far turn, lost
command with a quarter mile remaining, fought back into the stretch, lost contact at the eighth pole, drifted out and stayed on to hold the place. PAIGE
ANNE stalked the pace from inside, put in a mild bid inside the leader at the half-mile pole, could not keep pace leaving the backstretch, chased inside
through the far turn and kept on for the show honors. AS TIME GOES BY stumbled leaving the gate, reserved early from inside then moved out to the two
path and came up empty in the lane. COVER VERSION tracked off the pace, dropped back around the far turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SHIZAAM (IRE) settled off the pace in the opening stages, closed in while angling out five wide leaving the far turn, struck the front with a furlong remaining,
drew clear and held safely under urging. QUINEVERE (GER) steered to the inside early, came out a bit and went two wide into the second bend, angled
four wide leaving the turn, rallied through the final furlong to gain the place but could not threaten the winner. BELLIZE angled to the inside for the first turn,
moved out and stalked outside a rival on the backstretch, went two then three wide around the far turn, gained the lead in upper stretch but was overtaken
at the eighth pole and flattened to third. FABIOLLA (GB) chased at the back of the pack up the backstretch, moved out on the far turn and came four wide
into the stretch and produced a mild rally for a minor award. BEIRUT BEAUTY set the pace from inside under pressure, cleared rival at the
seven-sixteenths, saved ground into the drive, overtaken in upper stretch and weakened. THE GINGER QUEEN (IRE) traveled near the back of the field
early on, went between rivals at the seven-sixteenths, stayed in the two path on the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch and improved position. PLUMA
angled to the inside on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened. I GIVE UP dropped to the back quickly, raced outside rivals on the
backstretch, went four wide into the far turn, was floated out a bit on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and passed tired rivals. MONGOLIAN
MISSION broke in, prompted the pace from outside, lost contact at the seven-sixteenths and faded through the late stages. BIG MOON tucked inside early,
remained along the inside into the far turn, came two wide into the stretch and tired. RETURN TO HARBOR angled down to the two path early, went three
deep into the far turn, drifted out to the five path briefly around that bend but was corrected and steered back in to come three wide into the stretch and
never made an impact.
