XAVEY DAVE vied for command between foes soon after the break, edged forward to a narrow advantage nearing the lane, shook clear leaving midstretch
and widened late under firm encouragement. ROAD TRIP, urged inside foes through the backstretch disputing the pace, dueled inside the eventual winner
to upper stretch but proved no match late. EYES FLYING BYE, in touch with the leaders five wide in the opening stages, continued in pursuit of the top pair
racing four deep into the turn and flattened out midstretch. RED WAVE was rated off the first flight between foes, angled inside entering the turn, saved
ground to the lane but had no closing bid. SILENT SAILOR tracked just off the first flight between foes in the opening stages, angled inwards racing through
the turn while being prompted to gain some position but came up empty in the drive. KING OF THE KIDS flashed brief pace three wide between foes racing
to the turn and gave way after a half. WILDCAT SKY was slow into stride and trailed thereafter.

CENTRAL PARK broke readily, attended a rival's pace to the backstretch under light rating, moved to press the issue nearing upper stretch and wrested a
narrow advantage through the closing stages under steady pressure. MARKET ANALYSIS, bumped lightly at the start, sped to the lead while angling to the
inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the rail racing to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid but came up second best. LORD DRAGON broke
outwards. was collected, then rated off the first flight shifting to the outside racing to the first turn, continued outside a rival in second flight to the far turn,
shifted to the three path while being prompted to advance but finished evenly late. BEAT THE HEAT settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch
and never gained contention. CODETOWIN, caught in tight quarters at the start, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the far turn and
faded into the lane.

Footnotes
SUPERSTAR BEA angled to the inside tracking off the first flight inside foes racing to the backstretch, continued inside rivals to upper stretch, shifted out,
then angled sharply to the rail when presented an opening racing past midstretch and wrested a narrow advantage nearing the wire to prevail under firm
handling. WESTERN BERLIN angled inwards to prompt the pace outside a rival racing through the first turn to the backstretch, pressed the issue into the far
turn, edged forward midstretch to gain a narrow advantage between calls but couldn't fend off the winner. GIVEITSOMEWELLIE settled between foes in the
opening stages, shifted out three wide racing through the backstretch gaining terms with the second flight, continued to advance in that path on the far turn
to upper stretch to gain striking distance but was outkicked by the top pair. BELLA FIGURA (IRE), urged to the lead along the inside, dueled for command
inside a rival to the far turn, drifted out leaving midstretch and yielded nearing the wire. LILA'S LUCKY LADY hopped at the start, was settled outside foes
racing to the backstretch, came under stout pressure to advance racing four wide through the far turn, was fanned five wide in the closing stages and
continued evenly. UNCHAINING MELODY (GB) angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, shifted out nearing upper stretch
while being prompted to advance but had no rally. DUSTY PRINCESS settled last along the inside to the backstretch, angled out six wide racing through the
lane but made no impact. KIMBERLY FRANCES settled outside a rival racing to the far turn, was fanned seven wide in the closing stages but proved no
factor. TOURIST LIKE ME tracked off the first flight between foes for a half but retreated early.

J J'S WILDCAT angled to the rail tracking just off the pacesetter as part of the second flight racing to the turn, saved ground to the lane, came through
inside the pacesetter when presented an opening nearing midstretch and wrested a clear advantage late under firm encouragement NATURAL CHILL
tracked the leaders three deep between foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch and continued with
interest to edge a rival for the place honors nearing the wire. DEPUTY LAW, urged inside rivals disputing the pace while angling to the rail racing into the
turn, edged forward to a clear advantage in upper stretch but failed to sustain his momentum. TOP DOG stumbled at the start, settled well off the leaders
along the inside, saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest inside foes to gain position to the end. WARBUCKS bobbled at the start, was
settled off the leaders racing to the turn, then gradually drew into contention splitting rivals in foes late stages to improve position. TAPIT SAM, urged
between foes disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way into upper stretch. HOLDENTIGHT tracked the pace between foes in second flight,
briefly gained striking position racing into upper stretch but emptied out in late stages. HEAVENLY GAZEBO tracked the leaders four wide as part of the
second flight racing to the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and faded. WEAREINITTOWINIT joined the pace three wide in the opening quarter,
pressed the issue in that path into the turn and gave way after a half. WIND OF DISCRETION ducked out at the start and trailed thereafter.

Footnotes
OFF RAMP was hustled up the rail to contest the pace racing into the turn, shook clear on the bend, held sway into upper stretch and held MORGS WORLD
safe to the end under firm handling. The latter broke sharply, was urged six wide prompting the pace, shifted inwards to race along the rail nearing the
midway point of the turn, then continued willingly along the inside to challenge inside the winner nearing the wire. REID'S FANGIRL tracked off the first flight
three deep between foes into the turn, steadied off MORGS WORLD when momentarily losing her path midway through the turn, shifted out four wide in
upper stretch and continued with interest to improve position to the end. LIPSTICK LADY, urged four wide between foes pressing the pace from the outset
into the turn, faded into upper stretch. ROLLIN BLACKOUT, off a bit slowly, settled along the inside early, switched out gathering momentum racing into the
turn, split foes, then shifted four wide racing into the lane while finishing evenly. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER was urged three wide between foes prompting the
pace into the turn and gave way in late stages. LATIN NIKKITA broke inwards bumping IMPULSUS, was righted to make brief pursuit between foes just off
the inside in the opening stages, dropped off the first flight while angling inside entering the bend, then was taken up nearing the midway point of the turn
avoiding MORGS WORLD and had no closing response. INDOMITABLE OMA, steadied avoiding close quarters early, never gained contention. ASENA,
held up off the second flight while going a bit erratically early, was prompted to advance nearing the bend, then steadied off rivals racing into the turn and
never gained contention. GAME OF INCHES, bumped at the start, settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn and failed to menace. IMPULSUS,
bumped at the start, dropped out early. KISSES ARENT FREE made brief pursuit of the pacesetter five wide between foes early and emptied out abruptly
racing into the turn.

Footnotes
JOE JACKSON, prominent four wide in the opening stages, pressed the leaders three wide through the turn and found some late momentum to wrest a
clear advantage under pressure. HERBIE, urged between foes pressing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the turn, couldn't match the winner late
but edged a rival for the place honors. DANZ A REBEL, urged inside foes disputing the pace from the outset to midstretch, weakened in late stages.
CANDY WOMPUS settled into stride along the inside, shifted out splitting rivals nearing the lane, angled five wide in the last furlong and was making some
belated progress. CIMPL MAN tracked off the first flight four wide between foes, angled in racing into the lane but had no final bid. SPIRIT MISSION angled
inwards to track between foes in second flight racing to the turn and faded into upper stretch. VOW OF FRANCIS angled to the inside tracking the leaders
just off the second flight but offered no rally. MASTERFUL STRIDE broke awkwardly, swerved outside rivals early and failed to menace. DROP THE
GLOVES proved no factor. TALKING ZIP dropped out early.

Footnotes
KISSMELIPS broke readily, was urged inside a rival disputing the pace into the backstretch, shook clear racing into the far turn, maintained a comfortable
advantage past midstretch and held the late challenge of PRINCESS RENEE to the end under firm encouragement. The latter tracked off the second flight
along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn while being prompted to advance and continued willingly to close the gap to
the end. K B'S MINT tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the backstretch, made brief progress to gain contention three wide between foes
racing into the far turn but lacked the needed late bid. BAILDON tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing three wide to the far turn and continued
evenly in that path into the stretch. QUALITY CHROME off slowly, was settled between foes racing to the backstretch, was fanned four wide into the lane
and made an effort to improve position. GOLDIE'S DELIGHT settled last along the inside, shifted out racing into the far turn to split foes three wide in the
lane but made no impact. PAYNTER'S LOVE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch. BEEMER
BRIDGETTE settled along the inside to the backstretch and never gained contention. HALF SCOUT, urged prompting the pacesetter to the backstretch,
gave way racing into the far turn. DIGGS WON, fractious in the gate, settled between foes and never gained contention. BRIAR THICKET, off a bit slowly,
dropped out of contention early.

Footnotes
PLANE TALK broke well from the gate then was hustled for the lead between foes to take a brief early lead, attended the pace set by COLLEGE PARTY to
the inside then drifted out three wide at the top of the stretch, switch leads and dug in gamely under steady right-handed pressure to prevail on the wire. JO
DEE'S ANGEL pressed the pace three wide into the turn, commenced a bid in the same path at the three sixteenths pole, finished willingly, had every
chance to go by but was outfinished in the final sixteenth by PLANE TALK while under steady urging through the lane. COLLEGE PARTY was a bit slow
into stride, forced the pace on the rail while under hand urging, led the field into the stretch, collared by multiple rivals nearing the sixteenth pole but finished
will to hold on for show. SKIPPY'S STRIKE was off a bit slow, settled on the inside to the half, took back to trail nearing the three eighths pole then
commenced a five wide bid circling the field into the lane and rallied belatedly for a minor share. MISTER BANJOMAN chased the pace on the inside
through the bend then finished evenly between foes while under steady pressure through the lane. PICKNNGRINN lacked early speed out of the gate,
angled over to the rail to save ground through the turn, shifted out at the top of the stretch but had no late kick between foes. PERFECT FANNY was well
back between foes early, caught in the two to three path on the turn, altered course by angling to the outside midstretch and failed to threaten late.
BIARRITZ tracked the early pace two wide and faded past the three eighths pole. RAY'S ANGEL showed brief foot out of the gate then dropped back to trail
and was no factor.
