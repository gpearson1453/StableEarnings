Footnotes
ZIG set the pace along the inner rail, opened a clear lead leaving the turn, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and was
under brisk urging until deep stretch. CONGRESS HALL , slow to begin, circled the turn four deep and rallied. SACRED LADY lacked speed, was in the two
path between horses around the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and had a mild rally. SOLEA saved ground around the turn, eased out to the
two path near the eighth pole and failed to rally. SUBLIMITY prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened. LOOKIN FOR CANDY , three deep
chasing the pace down the backstretch, gave way on the turn and was eased.

Footnotes
DOMINATING BUYER sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined around the turn by GREEN EYES, dueled with that one into the lane,
drifted out while holding a tenuous advantage in mid stretch, corrected and drove clear. GREEN EYES broke a step slow, pulled her way forward outside
rivals and prompted the pace three wide into the turn, moved to engage the winner past the five sixteenths, was floated out while battling past the furlong
grounds but continued on willingly to be clear of the rest. MEGALOMANIA chased off the inside, circled four wide into the lane, shifted in near mid stretch
and nabbed the show. MS. HAITI rated forwardly, had aim off the engaged leaders past the five sixteenths, angled three wide into the lane but lacked a
serious finish. PASS IT ON , off the pace and three deep into the turn, dropped in some through the drive but lacked a rally. MINER'S GEM saved ground in
an even effort. KEEPYOURSKATESON , between rivals and off the early pace, was pulled up when sustaining an injury to her right front in upper stretch
then was vanned off.

COMPLETED PASS , urged from the gate to hold a forward spot, disputed the pace three wide outside SOUTH SEA, took over from that one leaving the
three sixteenths, spurted clear when roused right handed in mid stretch, widened soon after then held firm while mildly hand ridden the final seventy yards.
GINS AND TINS , taken in hand and trailed into the turn, angled out and circled four wide into the stretch, leveled off nicely through the final furlong and
gained the place. SOUTH SEA had sharp speed and set a pressured pace two wide, dueled into the lane, could not match strides leaving the eighth pole
then gave way grudgingly. HARD FOUGHT broke slowly, edged up three wide nearing the half mile marker and stalked, was under pressure nearing the
quarter pole but failed to seriously kick on. DESHACKLED , away alertly, was rated back off the leaders and saved ground, came out late but failed to
menace. WARM SUNNY BREEZE , off slowly, regrouped and moved up between foes to be in range after three sixteenths, saved ground while chasing mid
turn, stayed in touch to mid stretch then faded.

Footnotes
CRANSTON'S NETWORK , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, secured command entering the stretch, opened up in mid stretch and was under
urging. RIPPOLINO lacked speed, was two wide on the turn behind rivals, altered course to the four path at the head of the stretch and rallied outside foes.
MIRACLE BOBBIE saved ground on the turn, eased out to the three path in upper stretch and flattened out. FRANCIS X. , steadied in close quarters leaving
the starting gate, hugged the inner rail around the turn, eased out to the two path in upper stretch and lacked a serious response. FEROCIOUS STORM ,
quickly clear, eased over to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, remained along the rail and gave way in upper stretch. EFFULGENT , chased the pace
while in the two path around the turn, weakened through the stretch. FORE ON SEVEN , three deep on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch and gave
way.

Footnotes
MISS MAJORETTE , bumped at the break, settled off the pace three wide and outside a rival, angled six wide with some momentum into the lane, leveled
off under left handed asking near mid stretch, switched over to her left lead when carried out by FAST LANI inside the sixteenth marker, sustained a solid
run under steady hand encouragement and forged ahead in the final jumps. POLISHED GAL dropped in early, took closer order past the five sixteenths,
angled out into the lane, shifted back in as the leader drifted in mid stretch, worked between rivals nearing the sixteenth pole, gained a short lead late,
finished gamely but was nipped at the wire. FAST LANI , bumped with TRIKKI NIKKI soon after the start, sparred to the inside of that one heading to the
turn, pulled clear under rating soon after, set the pace off the rail into the lane, wandered outward through the final furlong and gave way grudgingly.
BEHIND THE COUCH rated off heels early, raced four wide mid turn, edged up between foes past the three sixteenths but lacked a serious finish.
CHROMEPLATED HEART angled in heading to the turn, took closer order and had aim into the stretch, chased past mid stretch then faded.
RAPIDASHQUEEN , three wide mid turn, failed to menace. NO VENTI NO WAVY bore out at the break and bumped with the winner, corrected and rated
along while saving ground, stayed inside into the lane but lacked a rally. TRIKKI NIKKI drifted in and bumped FAST LANI in the early stages, vied outside
that one into the turn, drifted out while pursuing into the lane and gave way. BUCKEY'S CHARM dropped off the pace, saved ground into the turn and was
outrun.

EVERETT'S SONG bore out leaving the starting gate, saved ground around the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, swept to command inside the
sixteenth pole and drew out under steady handling. KENNY HAD A NOTION , two wide on the turn, chased the pace to mid stretch and flattened out. SUE
LOVES BARBADOS saved ground around the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and lacked a serious rally. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , quickly clear,
set the pace along the rail and weakened late. CASH COMES FIRST circled the turn three deep, floated to the four path turning for home and was not a

Footnotes
DIXIE'S FASCINATOR settled outside while within range, angled three wide and took closer order around the final turn, shifted further out in upper stretch,
made a grinding run while under right handed rousing, wandered outward through the final furlong and just got up. GHOST MAIDEN tracked the leader from
the outside, moved up in hand and applied more pressure into the far turn, dueled into the lane, gained a short lead with a furlong to go, edged away a bit
while under a drive near the sixteenth marker, dug in when confronted in deep stretch but just missed. MONSTER RISING , bumped at the break, stalked
the pace while saving ground, eased out in the drive and churned on. CALI DIVINE had a wide trip and offered a mild response. MEXICALI ROSE cleared
early then dropped in to secure the rail, set the pace under some rating, was joined nearing the far turn, was under coaxing holding a slim lead into the
stretch, was headed a furlong out then faded through the final seventy yards. HAPPYLIFE , taken to rate while saving ground, eased out near the five
sixteenths but lacked a rally. LEIA ORGANA , bumped at the break, dropped off the pace, saved ground into the lane but failed to respond.
