Footnotes
ODESSA prompted the early pace, saved ground while two wide between horses on the second turn, was engaged by REV REE leaving the turn, drifted out
leaving the quarter-pole, dueled with REV REE and gamely won the head bob at the end. REV REE stalked the early pace, was three wide on the second
turn, gained ground to engage ODESSA off of the turn, came out a path leaving the quarter-pole responding to ODESSA drifting out, dueled to the line with
ODESSA and just missed for the win while well clear of the rest. NORTHERN ROSE settled toward the rear in the early going, saved ground while
improving position on the second turn but was outkicked by the top two in the stretch. IRISH AFFAIR steadied while in traffic on the first turn and run onto
the backstretch, saved ground on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. BREAKING THE CODE set the pace through the second turn while
being pressured, saved ground on the turn but was quickly confronted off of the turn and gave way in the stretch. BLUSHING BAY stalked the pace, was
four wide on the the second turn and faded in the stretch. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO ODESSA DRIFTING OUT IN THE UPPER
STRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT ODESSA COST REV REE THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND
DISQUALIFIED HER FROM FIRST TO SECOND.

UPO settled in the midflight, mounted a bid while two wide on the second turn, came to terms with IMPERATOR and wore down that foe in the end to
prevail. KNOWN was unhurried in the early going, rallied on the second turn while three then four wide and just got up in the final strides to win the head
nod for second. IMPERATOR sat off of the early pace while saving ground on the second turn, was confronted by UPO off of the turn, met that foes
challenge for a sixteenth but relented in the end and just missed for second. ANGELO'S PRIDE settled in the middle of the field, saved ground on the
second turn, checked while in tight quarters nearing the head of the stretch and made a mild late bid in the stretch. CAJUN BETTOR sat off of the early
pace, was three wide on the second turn and weakened in the stretch run. HARDY CHISEL broke alertly and was hustled to set the pace, saved ground on
the second turn but was confronted nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the stretch run. JOURNEY TO RUN was unhurried in the early stages,
trailed into the backstretch and run into the second turn while saving ground and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FREEPORT JOE was unhurried in the early going, mounted a bid while six wide on the second turn, was bumped at the eighth pole by a chain reaction
when TED drifted out, made a late surge in the final sixteenth and was up in time to get by TRASH TALKIN CAT to prevail. TRASH TALKIN CAT set the
pace while in a comfortable rhythm through the second turn, led into the final sixteenth but was outfinished by FREEPORT JOE while holding on for second.
TED sat just off of the early pace, was three wide on the second turn, drifted out nearing the furlong marker into K P D DAY who then came out into three
other rivals, and finished willingly in the stretch, and just missed for second. SPACE ODESSEY settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the
second turn and made a late rally along the rail in the stretch. BERNALINHO sat just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn and made a late
gain in the stretch drive. OUR EXPECTATION settled in the midflight, saved ground while two wide on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the
stretch. RECKONING DAY prompted the pace by TRASH TALKIN CAT, was three wide on the second turn, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in
the late going. K P D DAY stalked the early pace, was four wide on the second turn, took up at the eighth pole when TED drifted out and then bumped QUE
SERA SIR RALPH in the process and gave way in the late stages. QUE SERA SIR RALPH settled toward the rear of the field, was four wide on the second
turn, took up at the furlong marker when K P D DAY came out a path and flattened out in the final stages. I WILL YEAH (IRE) tracked the early leaders from
the midflight, was five wide on the second turn, took up at the eighth pole when TED caused a chain reaction of several runners and weakened in the final
sixteenth. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING TED, K P D DAY, QUE SERA SIR RALPH, I WILL YEAH AND
FREEPORT JOE AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT TED DRIFTED OUT A PATH AT THE EIGHTH POLE THAT CAUSED A CHAIN
REACTION OF THOSE RUNNERS AND DISQUALIFIED TED FROM THIRD TO TENTH.

and set the pace from the rail to the stretch but was overtaken nearing mid stretch and tired. ELUSIVE LOVE was chasing to the turn while outside rivals
and four wide then lugged out to the six path leaving the five sixteenths and did not rally. EL CHARRO CHAMP had no speed, was three wide to the stretch,
