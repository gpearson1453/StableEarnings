BOBBI BABY RUN sped clear to dictate terms along the inside, was put to a drive at the top of the stretch and held safe. TELLURIDE QUEEN raced
outside, went four wide on the turn, got up for place late. INDIAN DIVA chased the winner two wide, lost place late. MINNIE ME HA was in just a tiny bit tight
at the start, moved in from three to two wide on the turn, ridden along but failed to rally. FELLINA trailed early, raced off the fence in the two to three path on
the turn and was never a threat. SAY HELLO TO HEAT broke outwardly, had just a brief amount of speed, dropped back three to four wide on the turn,
faded in the lane, was vanned off.

Footnotes
SUNNY JEWEL got away well, appeared to be lightly bumped in the early going, was just off the pacesetter between rivals heading up the backstretch, was
then forced to steady outside the seven-sixteenths as that one drifted out and alter in at that juncture, moved out from three to four wide on the turn for
room, took over at the head of the lane and drew clear while much the best. CALICHE was lightly bumped at the break, tracked the pace from inside, fought
on inside a rival but off the fence to gain the place. RUN LIKE THE WIND stumbled and was bumped into a rival at the break then urged forward, drifted out
numerous paths between the half-mile marker and seven-sixteenths pole before angling back in to about the two path into the turn, was overtaken leaving
that bend, lost the place in a prolonged battle. RIGHT FOR YOU was bumped at the break, raced unhurriedly at the rear just off the inside, belatedly gained
two to three wide. HENNESSY MARK bumped the inner foe at the start then had to steady and veer off course, raced in behind the leaders, moved out from
two to four wide on the turn, had no rally thereafter. WILEO PROCEED bumped the inner rival then had to steady hard at the start, shifted in before entering
the turn saving ground early on that bend, angled out four wide near the quarter pole and ran on. WAY RITE bumped a rival lightly in the early going, had to
steady on heels and alter in near the seven-sixteenths, then moved out from three to four wide on the turn and out a further path or so into the lane but had
no rally. SKYZAAM'S HUMOR showed brief speed four to five wide then came up empty. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
CRITICAL DECISION pressed the pace from inside a rival while under stout restraint in the early stages, allowed more rein into the turn putting a head in
front at the five-sixteenths, was thereupon pressured coming to the quarter pole still sparring inside a foe, regained the lead soon after, kicked clear into
mid-stretch and held safe. ABBIE'S WAY bumped a foe lightly soon after the break, settled off the pace, began to advance two to three wide on the turn,
was gaining quickly in deep stretch but too late. SINGING MARY bumped the outer rival lightly soon after the start, switched out after a quarter and stalked
the leading pair, went two to three wide on the turn and ran on mildly but lost place late. A GREAT VICE hopped slightly the start but soon moved forward to
prompt the pace from outside going two wide into the turn, came up empty. WHAT A SURPRISE was placed mid-pack three to four wide and failed to rally.
DAWN TERA failed to threaten racing inside. BALLINOUTTACONTROL was off the leaders early, moved in four to three wide on the turn and was never a
threat. PRINCESS JADA was bumped lightly on both sides soon after the break, moved out and went five wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
MARK'S WARRIOR broke inwardly a bit, was urged soon thereafter but lacking early speed, shifted in leaving the backstretch then a bit further on the turn
going four then three wide on that bend, found room between rivals in mid-stretch and got up late under steady handling. LEAD MONTEREY switched off
the inside about the seven-sixteenths, commenced a bid leaving the turn having going four to five wide, made a steady but slow gain in the stretch to get up
for second late. FABSTRACTION broke just a bit awkwardly but recovered to track the leading trio inside, gained on those into upper stretch and kept on but
was outkicked by the aforementioned pair. LONZO WHO broke a step slowly and was in tight, moved forward to race outside foes mid-pack into the turn,
went six wide on that bend, gained mildly but evened out compared to others. BYE BYE MATTY P contended between runners to the half, made a mild bid
three wide turning for home, faltered and faded. LIFE JACKET vied inside runners but off the fence, faltered and faded. CHARLIE DYNASTY raced evenly
in the two path on the turn and gained mildly in the stretch. INFINITE HEAT vied outside runners four wide to the quarter, faltered and faded. JET SET
WARRIOR was urged along early, raced in the three to four path and was never a factor.

NEAR GENIUS vied inside runners, edged clear into upper stretch, was kept busy and held. MY STORM WARRIOR attended the early pace from outside,
eased back off the leading duo stalking three wide into the turn, gained steadily but slowly in the lane. HOT CHARLIE exchanged a bump at the start, vied
between runners early then outside the winner two to three wide on the turn, had no extra in late stretch. CHUCKIES CHANCE was within range early
outside, stalked from four deep through the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. MR GOLD MAN tucked in behind the leaders three wide on the turn and failed
rally. SNIGGLE shifted in heading up the backstretch, dropped back and moved out two wide on the turn, was never a threat. COMET CAUSEY exchanged
a bump and stumbled at the start, went three to four wide on the turn. MISSISSIPPI MUSIC switched outside a foe early then shifted in to the rail midway on
the turn while toward the rear, came up empty.

Footnotes
BELLA DONA set the pace inside, edged clear on the turn, widened into upper stretch and held safe under steady handling. I'VE GOT IT attended the early
pace, continued to pursue three wide, was no match but second best. MISS ABILITY was bumped from both sides at the start, shifted in up the backstretch,
went two to three wide on the turn, ran along for show. INDIAN EXCELLENCE raced outside the second group going five wide on the turn and improved
position in the stretch. REAL ME pressed from outside early, dropped back four then three wide on the turn and continued to weaken. BERNICE WHO
bumped a rival then was in turn bumped back, shifted in and saved ground on the turn before moving out a bit late on that bend, failed to rally. LE GRAND
JOHANN bumped a rival at the start, went four wide on the turn, came out in upper stretch and made no bid. ANNIE GET UR GUNS pressed the eventual
winner two wide and between rivals, came up empty. CRAFTY WARRIOR shifted in heading into the turn, went three wide and was not a threat.
