LADY'S TRIBUTE unhurried in the early going, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a late bid five wide and proved the best late. MOLLYS
FLYIN HIGH stumbled at the start, racing from the rear, made a late bid, but couldn't keep up with the winner down the stretch. LUCKY LILY BE dueled for
the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA vied for the early advantage, saved ground around the turn
and tired down the lane. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HALEYS SAILOR raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, made a late bid and got up in time. PICKING ROSES unhurried in the early part,
made a late bid, racing four wide, finished willingly and was outfinished. BIG BOBBY BROWN vied for the early lead, challenged throughout, was
outfinished by the top two, while putting forth a game effort. RIPITTOTHERIGHT dueled for the early advantage, raced close throughout and lacked a late
kick. VENTURE FORTH lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. TIO BLAS raced within striking distance, came around the final turn on
the outside and weakened. COMEDIAN lacked early speed and was never close. HEAVY DUTY always raced near the back and was outrun. INTO ORBIT
raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
