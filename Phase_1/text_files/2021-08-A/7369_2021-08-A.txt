Footnotes
KING ANGELO coaxed from the gate, established the front and dueled along the inside with THE GREAT GAZOO in the two path, remained patiently
handled until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive holding well to the finish. GIRAMONTE veered out at the start
bumping SUIT OF ARMOR solidly into KING MOONRACER and squeezing back SUIT OF ARMOR forcing that rival to steady out between foes, chased
along the inside coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, ran on to the finish chasing the winner
home safe for the place honors. KING MOONRACER got bumped solidly askew at the start by SUIT OF ARMOR due to pressure from the veering outwards
GIRAMONTE, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got roused angled three wide for home, kept on to secure the show
honors. SUIT OF ARMOR got bumped solidly at the start by the veering out GIRAMONTE and in turn bumped KING MOONRACER as he was squeezed
out between rivals and steadied at the start conceding four to five lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased just off the inside from
the tail of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and showed good courage to improve position to the wire.
THE GREAT GAZOO coaxed from the gate, engaged the top one in head to head combat from the two path down the backstretch and through the far turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got shaken off with three-sixteenths to go and weakened.
BRIAN'S MISSION forwardly placed three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing outside a pair of rivals at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home,
strode greenly on his wrong lead until just outside the eighth pole and weakened to the finish.

Footnotes
FLINT RIDGE came out after the start, showed good speed and disputed the pace, vied in the two path while outside of a foe on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, dueled outside of the runner-up until the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under strong urging. UBIQUITOUS broke in and bumped
with a rival, was hustled to press the pace on the inside, vied along the rail while inside of FLINT RIDGE on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive,
dueled with the aforementioned foe until the sixteenth then was outfinished while able to preserve the place. SOUND MONEY broke a half-step slow,
bumped soundly with a foe when shaded out by FLINT RIDGE after the break, was urged along off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, gained
leaving the backstretch, advanced four wide under urging on the turn, chased under a drive into upper stretch and finished with good courage for the show.
SOAR bumped with an opponent at the start then was sent hard, moved out around the five-eighths pole, bumped with ASKIN FOR BASKIN while moving
closer near the half-mile pole, went around the turn in the two path, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. ASKIN FOR A
BASKIN bumped with a foe after the start, was urged along while moving around in an attempt to avoid kickback, bumped with SOAR near the half-mile
pole, chased three wide on the turn, pursued the dueling leaders under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. LAUGHING BOY bumped with a foe at
the start, pressed the pace on the far outside while being carried out by a wayward IMMORTALIZATION, was caught six wide outside that foe early on the
turn then dropped to the five path after going by that opponent, chased outside in the five path into upper stretch and tired. STICKY ISSUE broke a step
slow, moved out while urged off the pace midway down the backstretch, went two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch then
moved further out around the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. CANYOUHEARMENOW broke out then bumped with a foe after the start, angled in at
the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. IMMORTALIZATION broke out and hit the gate, lugged out while showing good speed,
dropped back fast while bearing out from the five path to the eighth path on the turn, came nine wide into the stretch and was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ABSAM just off the pace just off the inside tracking the front, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and followed his stable and barn mate three wide
into upper stretch, had that mate take to the two path straightened away as ALLEY OOP JOHNNY took to the inside and gained a clear path, got roused in
full to burst on through issuing a challenge a furlong out and nudging with KLICKITAT at that station, took command nearing the sixteenth marker drifting in
briefly to the two path forcing ATONE to be steadied at the sixteenth marker, dug in under threat through to the finish coming out steps from the wire placing
KLICKITAT in tight and forcing that rival to pause and lasted on the line. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, closed well in tandem with COLD HARD CASH outside a quartet through the final furlong and missed
at the end. COLD HARD CASH two to three wide through the first turn, chased four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, closed well outside of the aforementioned foe through the final eighth and missed at
the finish. KLICKITAT coaxed from the gate, raced two to three wide forwardly placed through the opening bend before settling just off the pace four paths
off the inside, went four wide through the far turn advancing to latch on the top pair three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting nudged a furlong out by ABSAM, fought on between foes to the finish but was put in tight in
the final steps to the wire and forced to pause as ABSAM came out slightly late on. LONESOME FUGITIVE (IRE) tracked the pace along the inside coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, had ALLEY OOP JOHNNY take to the inside directly in front at the
three-sixteenths and tipped out to the three path near the eighth pole attempting to follow the eventual winner through his seam, had the seam close down
and was paused in behind a wall of rivals coming to the sixteenth marker, gained some clearance late with too much to do. ATONE coaxed from the gate,
dueled from the three path with ALLEY OOP JOHNNY to his inside, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole and was set down spinning three wide
for home, took to the two path at the three-sixteenths as his main pace rival took to the hedge, dug in continuing to knock heads now joined by a host of
rivals to the outside, had his stable and barn mate come inwards slightly a sixteenth out and was forced to steady at that juncture, then got outfinished when
backing away in the late going. TAPALOOF brushed the off side stall and bobbled at the break, chased along the inside from the tail of the field coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tipped out three to four paths late and was outkicked. ALLEY OOP
JOHNNY coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with ATONE to his outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths now under pressure from a
pair, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the hedge straightened away, dug in under threat from a host of rivals and was overwhelmed when
collared inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
BABY BLYTHE was taken in hand early, went three wide early on the first turn then tucked closer to the two path, was reserved in the back half of the field,
rallied four wide while replacing a checking foe leaving the backstretch, took the lead midway through the far turn, dropped to the two path while kicking
clear coming to the quarter-pole and drew away under a strong drive. PALAMOS (GB) was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was
reserved near the middle of the field, checked while carried out into the far turn, was roused four wide on that bend then driven five wide into the stretch and
secured the place while no threat to the winner. FLEETING GLIMPSE was taken under a tight hold while behind horses early, saved ground near the back
of the field, slipped around checking foes into the far turn, came between horses while near the three path outside the five-sixteenths then dropped to the
two path, was driven into upper stretch, moved out late and just got up for the show. INVESTMENT INCOME hit the outside of the gate at the start, saved
ground on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, checked sharply leaving the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path on the final turn and
improved position to just miss the show. MEZCAL went to the front, showed the way on the inside through quick fractions and with company to her outside,
lost the advantage to the winner midway through the final turn, dropped back under urging into the stretch and tired. EMPRESS THEODORA established a
forward position early, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was well placed in third position, came out near the seven-sixteenths, was urged along
in the three path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch, switched back to her inside lead while dropping back outside the furlong marker and also tired.
POINT WILD broke and hit the gate then was asked before being taken under a hold early, saved ground while reserved off the pace, checked sharply
inside the seven-sixteenths while moving out behind a fading TEKILA despite room along the fence at that juncture, continued under brakes while being
shuffled back behind the aforementioned foe, was finally asked outside the quarter-pole then came four wide into the stretch and just missed the superfecta
while losing any chance of victory on the far turn. AMERICAN HEIRESS (GB) brushed the inside of the gate at the start while last away, was rank behind
horses in the early going, rounded the opening bend in the two path, settled near the back, checked and swerved five wide outside the three-eighths and
was no factor. TEKILA showed early speed on the outside, went two to three wide on the first turn, prompted the quick pace on the outside, was asked at
the seven-sixteenths, came up empty in the two path on the final turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

WIN WITH PRIDE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong splitting foes loosely inside the final sixteenth to get up in the last jumps to the finish. BABY I'M PERFECT coaxed from
the gate, showed the way along the inside under pressure from WAGON BOSS every step of the way, took the inside route into upper stretch, edged away
shaking off his main pace rival a furlong out, dug in as that foe came again this time with a friend and was caught in the final strides to the finish while just
preserving the place honors. WAGON BOSS pressed the leader from the outside three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was shaken off a furlong from home, came again nearing the sixteenth marker in tandem with the eventual
winner running on willingly but missed for the place honors while well clear for the show. SICILIA MIKE chased four to five wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. HAMMERIN AAMER chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. HONORABLE SERVICE coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide coming under a
long drive from the half mile pole, got ridden along through the turn and went four wide into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. REGAL QUALITY
chased just off the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. POPIZAR four paths off the inside
down the backstretch, went two to three wide through the turn coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, cornered three wide at the head of the stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
POWER AGENDA was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole
then came under a right-handed crop into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while battling inside of the runner-up inside the three-sixteenths,
dueled with that foe in the final furlong and gamely prevailed while rubbing saddles in the final yards. DON'T WAIT UP veered in at the start and bumped
with a foe while last to commence, settled on the far outside, gained five then four wide on the turn, made a bid approaching the five-sixteenths, was put to a
left-handed crop while leaning inward into upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner, moved in closer to that foe under a hand-ride inside the furlong
marker, was switched to a right-handed crop while on even terms at the sixteenth-pole, rubbed saddles with the winner to the wire and was denied. URBAN
FOREST was hustled from the start then well placed in the front half of the field, went two then three wide while roused on the turn then was driven five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. MONTAUK POINT broke out at the start, angled in while hustled for speed,
chased the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths between foes, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely between horses, vied in the two
path under urging while between foes on the turn, dropped back at the quarter-pole and tired. GENERAL STRIKE broke in and bumped with a foe, settled
behind horses near the back, was carried out outside the half-mile pole, went four then five wide under urging on the turn and failed to threaten. WILD
APPEAL was urged along near the middle of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, drifted in just inside the furlong marker and failed to respond.
DUKE OF EDINBURGH settled well back in the field, saved ground under urging on the turn, steadied while in tight against the rail in upper stretch and
faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. MIKE J bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved out just inside the
nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and faltered then was also eased but walked off. MAGICAL KNIGHT broke in
and bumped with an opponent, was coaxed along on the inside of DON'T WAIT UP, dropped back while moving from four to six wide on the turn and also
faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
RESTORED ORDER forwardly placed from the start, led briefly early on before being displaced by EXTREME FORCE under the wire the initial time, had
that rival spin three wide into the first turn and inherited back the front midway on the opening bend settling along the inside and into a comfortable rhythm,
showed the way patiently handled under some pressure from EUCHARIST to the outside, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged
away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to the finish under threat late. AMISTAD struck the off side stall at the start, settled two to three
wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish to close
in and secure the place honors. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped to the two path at the three-sixteenths and then to the three or four path a furlong out and closed
well to just get nosed for the place honors on the wire. MORE LIKE IT saved ground in pursuit from just off the pace, got let out spinning just off the inside
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. K. K. ICHIKAWA saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outkicked. VOLIERO four then three wide through the first turn,
chased just off the inside from mid pack under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. BRICCO tracked the
pace along the inside early on and then just off the inside through the far turn placed to coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch
offering up a mild bid, couldn't sustain the momentum and weakened to the finish. HOLY EMPEROR broke in at the start brushing JUSTINTIMEFORWINE,
chased along the inside from near the rear coaxed along from the three-eighths, took the inside route at the head of the stretch and offered no response.
BIG BLUE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under a ride three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. EXTREME FORCE forwardly placed just off the inside, took over command a bit eagerly under the wire the first time before going three wide into
the first turn and was taken hold and eased back to settle just off the inside midway on the first turn, steadied briefly into the backstretch and chased two
then three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. JUSTINTIMEFORWINE
brushed at the start by HOLY EMPEROR, who broke inwards, went three then two wide through the first turn, chased three wide from just off the pace,
swung three to four wide for home and tired. EUCHARIST three wide into the first turn, attended the leader in closest aim just off the inside, got let out
spinning in the two path into upper stretch and retreated, then folded in the lane.

SPEAKER'S CORNER bobbled at the start and was off a step slow, tugged at the bit under restraint early then was well spotted, ranged up while shifting
from the two path to the three path early on the turn, made a bid between foes with three furlongs to run, was asked while narrowly in front at the
five-sixteenths, shook clear under a left-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, was switched to a right-handed crop while drifting out some into the final
furlong and powered away under strong handling. DEFEATER was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved up then was taken in hand inside the
three-quarter pole, moved out around the nine-sixteenths, advanced five wide early on the turn, dropped to the four path while making a bid with three
furlongs to run, came in some under a drive in upper stretch then lost touch with the winner into the final furlong, moved in behind that foe shortly thereafter
and proved no match while able to get the place. MAHAAMEL hit the inside off the gate at the start then was hustled, disputed the pace on the outside, vied
in the two path early on the turn then came under heavy pressure between horses, was roused at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and
weakened but just held the show. WILL SING FOR WINE hit the inside of the gate at the start, settled off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, was
urged two to three wide on the turn, angled five wide outside the quarter-pole, chased into the final furlong and tired. MR. TIP settled on the outside, was
urged four then five wide on the turn then driven six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. TEN FOR TEN displayed good speed, contested the pace
on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked while inside a trio of foes at the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch and
capitulated. MEISTER broke in then hit the gate and was off a step slow, settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn, came three wide
into the stretch and failed to threaten. ASHIHAM was sent from the start, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the four path,
dropped back at the five-sixteenths, spun five wide into the stretch and faded.

HIGH OAK just off the pace four paths off the inside, tucked three wide into the turn and advanced on the front stacking up outside the duel and latching on
three furlongs from home, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, took over command inside the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive
getting geared down in the final jumps to the wire. GUNITE hustled away from the gate, advanced inside to duel with DOCTOR JEFF with five and a half
furlongs to go, knocked heads through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths briefly headed for the front now the innermost of a trio battling
for command, cut the corner into upper stretch re-establishing the front, dug in and was collared inside the three-sixteenths, ran on to chase the winner
home clear for the place honors. NAKATOMI chased along the inside just off the duel, came under encouragement with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. DOUBLE THUNDER broke last without incident and came under hustling, chased just off
the inside from the tail of the field coming under urging at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position to the
finish. DOCTOR JEFF led early on before being engaged on the front by GUNITE, dueled from the two path with that rival to his inside, came under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths taking narrow advantage at that station, spun three wide for home headed once more for the front, dug in under a drive and weakened
in the final furlong. STOLEN BASE coaxed from the gate, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. OTTOMAN EMPIRE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until
tucked inside half a mile from home, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. GLACIAL broke a half a beat
slow and brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along
from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home and made no impact. DANCE CODE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. RED RUN away to an awkward beginning when appearing to have lost his back footing, chased
five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing with three furlongs to go, swung four wide for
home and made no impact.

GOT STORMY went around the first turn in the two path, settled comfortably in third position, raced inside early on the far turn then moved to the two path
while ranging up in dead-aim of the leaders, was given her cue at the quarter-pole, rallied outside to take the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear
under a right-handed crop into the final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. SET PIECE (GB) broke a step slow and was last to commence,
navigated the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the outside at the rear while given cover, went three wide on the far turn, was roused while angling
five wide outside the quarter-pole then came six wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the place.
CASA CREED went around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside but with cover, was asked while three then four wide on the far turn then
driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly to get the show but couldn't go with the top two. BLOWOUT (GB) angled in while going to the front,
crossed over to the rail into the first turn, showed the way on a clear lead while in hand, was challenged on the far turn then asked while cornering into the
stretch, lost the advantage under a drive coming to the furlong marker and weakened then was caught for the show. DADDY IS A LEGEND was taken in
hand early then reserved while saving ground, moved to the two path before the mid-point of the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came out to
the three path while chasing the vanguard into the final furlong, altered inside from behind foes shortly thereafter and finished willingly but lacked the needed
kick and missed the superfecta. RAGING BULL (FR) settled on the inside, was roused with five-sixteenths to run, swung four wide into the stretch then
came under the crop around the three-sixteenths, raced between horses into the final sixteenth and lacked the needed kick then was taken in hand in traffic
late. WHISPER NOT (GB) was asked leaving the gate then pulled while taken in hand early, moved out into the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside in
the two path, issued a challenge on the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, battled between horses under a drive from the three-sixteenths to the
furlong marker and tired then was also taken in hand in traffic late. FIELD PASS rounded the first turn in the three path, settled on the outside without cover,
was roused while three wide on the far turn and failed to rally.

DR. DUKE broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got set down spinning
just off the inside for home, dug in under threat and dueled with PHANTOM SMOKE through the stretch and to the finish getting joined late on by a quartet
and gamely dug in in a blanket finish to prevail on the wire. PHANTOM SMOKE three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, got let out spinning three
wide into upper stretch, dug in to duel with the aforementioned foe through the length of the stretch fighting on tenacious to the wire but was ultimately
denied at the end. DR. BLUTE tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive running on to miss at the finish. NEURO chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out angled four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive tipping out near the eighth pole and nudged LUNA'S IN CHARGE into CLAMOR, then offered up a mild kick to miss in a
blanket finish at the line. CLAMOR bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide at the seven-sixteenths,
went four to five wide through the turn and seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, got bumped by LUNA'S IN CHARGE near the eighth pole
due to pressure from NEURO tipping out and offered up late foot. VOLKERT chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was outkicked and outfinished in the
late going. HALPERT struck the gate to the right side and was bumped by LUNA'S IN CHARGE getting away last and conceding four to five lengths to the
front, chased three to four wide, angled six wide into upper stretch, got roused a furlong from home and was under a light drive briefly before being flashed
the crop to the left side nearing the finish. FRAT broke out at the start and came under hustling, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then
two to three wide through the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MOMMIE'S JEWEL broke out at at the start and

four wide through the turn, continued four wide for home and weakened. LUNA'S IN CHARGE broke in at the start bumping HALPERT, chased two to three
wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, went five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was nudged and bumped
