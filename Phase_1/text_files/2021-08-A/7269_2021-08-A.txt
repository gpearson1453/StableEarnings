the early speed while saving ground, hustled up three wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained show. BORROWED ANGEL chased in range
around the turn, went four wide into the lane and got edged out late for show. SISTER HOLLIE sped to the lead at the start, lost the lead to LADY TIZMO

Footnotes
INSTINCTIVE stalked the top two leaders through the backstretch, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, reached the leader near mid-stretch,
dug in under pressure and kicked clear. LAPULGA set a pressured pace, dueled for the lead around the far turn, could not move on with the winner in the
final furlong but stayed on with response for second best. JUMPSTARTMYHEART settled through early stages, bid four wide heading into the lane, steadily
edged up closer and gained show. PRINCESS KILLMAIN pressed the pace, dueled around the far turn then flattened out in the lane.
PETTICOATSNPISTOLS raced off the early pace, hustled up five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. ALGODONAL steadied at the start and raced
off the pace, hustled up around the far turn, raced three to four wide and needed more for impact. GRECIAN DANCER saved ground around the far turn,
shifted out five wide in the drive and lacked a needed rallly. WHISPERING WANDA rated not too far back, saved ground into the lane and gave way.
COURTLY KITTY rated two wide near midpack then faded in the lane.
