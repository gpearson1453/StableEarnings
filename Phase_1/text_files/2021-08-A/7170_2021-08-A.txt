TORRES DEL PAINE took command at once, angled to the rail before a quarter, drew out on the backstretch then was clearly best under mild urging.
SAMUI SUNSET wasn't far back between horses, came out three wide on the final turn and proved second best while no threat. BOB IN OUR MIDST fell
back outside after a quarter, raced three wide around the final turn and continued evenly through the lane. TRI TRY COLORS was bumped shortly after the
break, advanced outside on the backstretch, maintained striking position three wide around the final turn then tired. MISTER FRANK'S WAY ducked out into
TRI TRY COLORS leaving the gate, advanced inside on the backstretch, was checked midway on the final turn then flattened out. RINGLE BELLE pressed
two wide outside the winner for over a half and was finished after six furlongs.

WHISPURRING KITTEN was rated in good position outside, raced three wide around the turn, rallied to the front just after a half and drew clear late. DOC
GIRL broke slowly, advanced inside, waited for room behind the leaders nearing the stretch, got clear entering the stretch, gave her best through the final
furlong but wasn't enough. SNOW FORECAST showed speed, raced two wide around the turn, was brushed entering the final furlong and weakened.
SEEKING THE DREAM made the early pace along the rail, ran out entering the stretch then weakened. WOODBINE WAY steadied while not far back along
the rail nearing the turn, came out for the drive, brushed SNOW FORECAST and steadied entering the final furlong then flattened out. Objections by
Chiappe against SEEKING THE DREAM on the backstretch and against SEEKING THE DREAM and SNOW FORECAST in early stretch were not allowed.
ONTHISHARVESTMOON was outrun. BRAZILIAN BAY steadied in tight between rivals on the backstretch then stopped.
