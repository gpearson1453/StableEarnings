MO MONEYHONEY pressed the pace, came around the turn four wide, drove clear deep in the stretch and won under steady urging. BROWN EYED
ANGEL vied for the early lead, raced three wide around the turn, angled inside, proved no match match for the winner, but was best of others. SMACKFIRE
dueled for the early lead, saved ground around the turn, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. ELLA'S MY GIRL lacked early
speed, improved position, but was no factor. STORMY COLLISION challenged for the early lead and made a steady retreat. WHISKEY TO WINE raced
within striking distance, weakened and was no threat late. SUNI LALUNI broke out, near the front, dropped back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

Footnotes
GRAND ATLANTIC went to the front, drove clear, led throughout, was all out and held on well for the win. GUILTY LOVER pressed the pace, forwardly
placed throughout, split rivals down the stretch and finished willingly. NOW YOU RULES was an early factor, raced near the front throughout and lacked a
finish. SAINT SCOTTY lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. LOOKIN HIGH raced in the back of the
pack in the beginning and passed tired ones late. CHARMING BULLET raced near the back, came around the first turn on the outside and was never a
threat. DREAMONMEBABY raced within contention, came around the final turn three wide and dropped back.
