Footnotes
LOGICAL MYTH well rated fired out of the far turn vying at mid track from the eighth pole dueling inside of rival late prevailing under stiff left hand urging.
MONARCHS GLEN (GB) in close at the break was content to sit back waiting to move angling out into the far turn emerging in the six path upper stretch
hooking rival from the outside late battling to the wire. CANNON'S ROAR stalked the pace through the backside rallying three deep to wrest the lead in
upper stretch ceding grudgingly late to wide pressure. HEMP HEMP HURRAY slow early lagged to the far turn cutting the corner into upper stretch
responding to finish well along the rail. MUTAKATIF (IRE) stalked the pace laying close to the far turn chasing there into upper stretch weakening late along
the inside. WORTHY TURK lagged through the far turn angling five wide into upper stretch posing no menace there. ANANROAD hustled out was left alone
on pace to the far turn, confronted nearing the quarter pole would fade in the three path upper stretch. ADONIS CREED was never involved.

Footnotes
MR. WIRELESS sat on a soft pace pressing three deep to lead on the far turn shaking clear inside in upper stretch angling out to hold sway under outside
pressure. WARRANT tracked evenly through the backside coming under a ride four wide on the far turn extending from mid track down the lane keeping the
winner honest to the end. BOURBONIC slow early began to respond near the three eighths pole traveling five wide into upper stretch finding best stride
after the fact. BOURBON THUNDER moved between horses on a soft pace dueling inside of rival through the far turn into upper stretch extending in the
three path coming up a bit short. KINETIC SKY away alertly kept a narrow lead on soft splits through the backside, pressured on the far turn would waver
into upper stretch giving way on the inside. AMERICAINAED was completely overmatched.

Footnotes
BEE WINGS tracked evenly on the inside through the backstretch, angled out into upper stretch taking aim five wide surging clear. ON BRILLIANT raced
mid pack rallying to upper stretch being blocked an eighth out angling inside then back out again late rallying for place. PEPPER THEM GIRL prompted the
pace dueling to upper stretch extending inside weakening late. A MERRY PRANKSTER hustled out pressured the pace dueling through the far turn into
upper stretch wearing down late. CALLINGHERCOLLINS unhurried early rallied to upper stretch losing path while in tight between horses an eighth out
finishing evnly. BLUE ROCKETTE tracked the pace chasing outside to upper stretch weakening there. ROAD TO QUALITY slow early played no factor.
TAMIAMI was never involved. AWESOME EVIL was close early racing wide giving way near the half. COCO MACHEN hustled early would give way on the
backside. AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF CALLINGHERCOLLINS AGAINST THE RIDER OF BEE WINGS FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER
STRETCH WAS DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
