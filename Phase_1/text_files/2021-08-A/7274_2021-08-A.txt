CLASSY COWBOY set the pace while racing off the rail and clear, then came out to the three path leaving the turn and dug in gamely through the lane to
hold sway late under a drive. TOSS OF FATE was four wide into the first turn, then rated four wide along the backstretch, came five wide into the drive,
closed well to just miss. JOVA was off slowly, then settle in three wide down the backstretch, split rivals by the furlong marker and rallied. UNBRIDLED
BEAST was well placed on the inside throughout but lacked the needed punch in the drive. TWO LAST WORDS stalked the pace three wide and came four
wide into the drive and faded.

turn then had nothing left late. CANDY CURL vied for the lead on the inside, then fell off the pace on the turn, came three wide into the drive and faded.
