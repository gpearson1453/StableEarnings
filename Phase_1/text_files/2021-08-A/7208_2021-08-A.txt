Footnotes
NEWPARK (IRE) set the pace under pressure from outside, shook free at the quarter pole, put to right-handed urging in the lane and held gamely.
AURELIAN MAN stalked off the rail, steadied off heels at the seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide around the turn, tipped out mid-stretch and got up
for the place. KAZUHIKO (AUS) was off a bit slow to begin, shifted out into the turn, angled back to the two path around the bend, lacked room and angled
out in upper stretch, then came with a late bid to earn the show. GREGORY'S PRIDE away quickest then dropped back to chase, went two then three wide
around the turn, stayed within striking distance in the final furlong bu lacked the needed late punch. CALI BAY (IRE) got bumped and steadied between
early, moved to the inside then a bit off the rail, lacked room into the stretch, tipped out and finished willingly. AVENTAPP got bumped from outside early,
saved ground through the turn and weakened. PERFECTO AMOR chased off the rail, raced three deep then four wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
HERE'S MY POINT broke slow and spotted the field a few lengths, trailed to the turn, traveled four then three wide around the bend and failed to menace.
SAI CON (FR) veered out and stumbled leaving the gate, went up to press the pace from outside, lost contact with a quarter mile remaining and faded in the
drive.

Footnotes
TIZ A MASTER pressed the pace from inside, stayed alongside the leader to the furlong grounds, gained the lead in mid-stretch and held well in the late
stages. KRISTI'S TIGER tracked outside rivals then four wide into the turn, moved down to the three path around the bend, closed well but was not enough
to threaten the winner. ANOTHER EDDIE got sandwiched at the start, took the turn three then four wide and finished willingly to gain the show. LI'L
GRAZEN trailed the field early, traveled three then four wide on the turn, angled widest in the stretch and kept on for a minor award. TEN THE SMART WAY
knocked into rival leaving the gate, set the pace under pressure from the inside, maintained a short lead to the eighth pole, lost command mid-stretch and
weakened in the final sixteenth. TRULY FABULOUS veered out and bumped rival at the start, stalked in the two path into the turn, chased two wide into the
lane and flattened. BIG PASSION bumped with inner rival at the start, chased outside a foe then between into the turn, dropped back around the bend and
faded.

CLEARLY GONE angled to the inside and settled on the rail, shifted three wide into the stretch, rallied three deep late and got up in time. ELLIE ARROWAY
established the front quickly, controlled the pace up the backstretch, shook free leaving the far turn and got nailed on the wire. ZABAVA stalked the pace
from inside, coaxed leaving the far turn, rallied between the top pair late and finished a game third. SUGARY bumped inside rival at the start, unhurried in
the early going and moved inside, lacked room near the five-sixteenths pole, stayed inside to the stretch, produced a mild rally up the inside and rounded
out the superfecta. RUNWAY DREAMER reserved in the early going from inside, saved ground then tipped out into the stretch, angled out further in the
lane but needed to find more late. PERFECT ICE STORM bumped leaving the gate then checked between soon after, settled near the back, raced outside
a rival up the backstretch, angled three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. MAD GRACE tracked in the two path early, angled four wide on the far
turn and weakened. LADY ROBIN raced up close outside the pacesetter, could not keep pace leaving the far turn, crowded between rivals at the eighth pole
and weakened. TIZNO'S DILEMMA sat off the pace early on outside a rival, went two wide into the stretch, came out in the lane and could not rally. TAKE A
LEAP traveled three wide or outside rivals, came four wide into the drive and weakened. WIND TARTARE (FR) was up close early outside the top pair, lost
ground on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CONNIE SWINGLE stalked the top pair off the inside, headed rival at the quarter pole, took over soon after, cleared at the three-sixteenths and powered
away in the furlong grounds. BIG NOVEL got bumped and pinched back at the start, raced off the pace, moved up and split foes at the quarter pole, rallied
through the stretch to earn the place but could not threaten the winner. SPOILED ROTTEN broke in and bumped rival in the beginning, dueled for the lead
outside RUN AUNTIE T RUN, cleared that rival at the three-eighths but was soon tested by the winner, got headed at the quarter pole, could not hold
CONNIE SWINGLE at bay and flattened to third in the final furlong. ADDYDIDIT broke in and bumped both sides leaving the gate, chased two then three
wide on the turn and lacked a late bid. INFINITE LOVE dropped back early, went two wide into the turn, angled five wide entering the stretch and kept on
through the final furlong to advance. RUN AUNTIE T RUN got knocked into rival leaving the gate, went up to duel for the lead from inside, lost contact at the
three-eighths and faded out of contention. SCAT ATTACK showed brief speed speed then dropped to mid-pack, went four then three wide around the turn
and weakened. ROUBAIX showed early speed then chased from inside, saved ground into the lane and also weakened. DIZZY LIZZY knocked into rival
leaving the gate, traveled five wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch and was not a factor. TIME TO SMILE broke out and bumped rival, chased off the
rail, lost ground nearing the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

ABSOLUTE UNIT tracked on the inside, waited for room past the quarter pole and into the stretch, gained a clear path and rallied to the front inside the
sixteenth pole and held over the runner-up. COMMANDING CHIEF settled on the inside, moved out into the two path for the far turn, put in tight quarters
and steadied at the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane, got bumped late and rallied to just missed. STONE'S RIVER set
the pace under pressure, moved clear at the three-eighths, held a short lead with a furlong to go, lugged out and bumped rival late and yielded to the top
pair. STEAK AND CHEESE stalked in the two path, moved out into the three path on the far turn then came back in and took aim two wide into the stretch,
bid outside the leader with a furlong remaining, drifted out mid-stretch, got bumped between rivals inside the final sixteenth and kept on to the wire.
RACETRACKERS traveled three wide early, raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, came four wide into the drive and weakened. SILENT MUSKETIER
raced between foes on the first turn then moved inside, angled three wide into the stretch and made no impact. INFATUATE raced three deep on the first
turn, two to four wide on the second bend and failed to menace. HAMMERING LEMON pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader at the
three-eighths, checked at the quarter pole and faded. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED STONE'S RIVER FROM THIRD TO
FOURTH FOR SHIFTING OUT LATE AND INTERFERING WITH STEAK AND CHEESE, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
ELM DRIVE broke alertly then took a stalking position behind the pacesetter, drew alongside on the turn, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, gained
command then fought with EDA late on the turn and into the stretch, battled through the final furlong and held gamely. EDA broke in and bumped SMASH
TICKET at the start, was forwardly placed near the inside, angled out on the turn, bid past the quarter pole, challenged through the lane, dug in the final
strides but could not get by. SMASH TICKET broke slow, got bumped and lost her path at the start, ran up on heels and had to steady at the half-mile pole,
advanced outside rivals on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and bested the rest. SAX sat off the pace early on, angled to the rail on the turn and
improved position in the drive. SHE'S SO SHINY chased on the inside then angled out for the turn, lacked room past the quarter pole, altered around rival
and could not summon the needed rally. ROSES FOR SUZZETT tracked outside a pair of rivals then came five wide into the drive and weakened.
LOVEHERHEART tracked between foes in the early going, exited the turn four wide and weakened. FIRST PROMISE hustled to the front, sped clear to set
the pace, got headed at the five-sixteenths, relinquished the lead soon after and gave way.

Footnotes
NORTHERN GEM off slow to begin, raced at the back of the pack, came five wide into the stretch, closed widest outside the top trio and got up. AVISSE
chased from inside, roused at the quarter pole, bid along the rail, led with a furlong to go while drifting out steadily and got caught on the line. INFO'S
TREASURE tracked outside a rival, three deep on the backstretch, went five deep at the five-sixteenths pole, rallied between late and finished a game third.
ZAHRA stalked between foes early then off the rail, bid three wide at the quarter pole, took over at the three-sixteenths, lost command at the eighth pole, got
floated out through the final furlong and finished gamely to the wire. CHEWY CHEWY GOOD traveled in mid-pack early, moved closer on the far turn,
angled to the inside in upper stretch but lacked the needed bid. HEART RIVER raced well off the pace, saved ground through the far turn, advanced in the
stretch but failed to threaten the leaders. SUMMER ROSE dueled for the lead on the inside, put away rival nearing the quarter pole, lost command into the
stretch and weakened. SUGAR KISSES went five wide into the first turn, angled down to the three path, checked between past the five-sixteenths pole,
came four wide into the stretch and weakened. LADY O'PRADO traveled along the rail then two wide on the first turn, went between at the half-mile marker,
angled out and raced four deep at the five-sixteenths, moved back into the three path into the lane and flattened out. KATLA bobbled leaving the gate, went
up to duel for the lead from outside, could not keep past with a quarter mile remaining and gave way in the stretch.
