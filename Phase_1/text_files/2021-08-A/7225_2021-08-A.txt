Footnotes
I GOT NO MUNNY tracked on the inside into the turn, angled three wide leaving the turn, tipped out widest in the drive, closed from outside and collared the
runner-up at the sixteenth pole and proved best. NOTRE DAME away quickly to grab the lead, set the pace into and around the bend, led into deep stretch
then got headed at the sixteenth and could not hold the winner at bay. SAVILE ROW broke out and bumped rival, was closest in pursuit to the turn, chased
two wide to the stretch and lacked the needed late kick in the final furlong. LAUREL RIVER stalked four then three deep, chased three wide around the turn,
had the rider lose the whip mid-stretch and flattened out. BUTKUS got bumped leaving the gate, chased between foes, three wide into the turn, moved
down to the two path then steered back out and came four wide into the lane and weakened. FEAST tracked widest up the backstretch, navigated the turn
four then five wide and tired.

Footnotes
QUEEN GODDESS forwardly placed outside a rival early, drew alongside the leader at the seven-sixteenths, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, cleared
past the quarter pole and remained strong to the wire under hand urging. FLORAL ESSENCE stalked from inside, lacked room and steadied near the
five-sixteenths, shifted out to the two path, finished willingly and outkicked SOMMER DAISY for the place. SOMMER DAISY (FR) broke slow and shifted out
at the start, tracked between rivals then came three wide into the drive and got outkicked for second. CEDAR'S STARS (GB) off slow to begin, trailed two
wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane and summoned a mild rally. RUBY'S ORCHID sped to the front, set the pace to the far turn, got tested at the
five-sixteenths, relinquished the lead soon after and weakened in the lane. LA GIOIOSA (FR) settled on the inside, pulled early then checked nearing the
half-mile marker, chased between into the far turn, two wide into the lane and never threatened. PEACHTREE ROAD chased three deep or three wide,
came four wide into the stretch and weakened. WHISTLER'S STYLE angled to the inside and pulled early off heels first time through the stretch, had to
steady slightly again off heels at the halfway mark, remained inside to the stretch and also weakened. CLIFFSOFTHUNDER (GB) hesitated and broke
inward, steadied off heels leaving the chute, pulled a bit on the backstretch, went four to five wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TWIRLING DERBY broke out and bumped rival, raced off the rail in range, went three wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend, rallied steadily
through the final furlong and got up in time. HAWK HILL sped to the front from inside, dueled for command with MAGIC TIGER, cleared that rival leaving the
turn, led clear into deep stretch and got run down in the final moments. MAGIC TIGER away quickest from outside, dueled for command outside HAWK
HILL, drifted four wide while losing contact with the leader leaving the turn, lugged out through the lane but kept on for a clear third. SUANCES SECRET
raced up close between the top pair then chased two wide into the turn, went two to three wide into the lane and lacked a serious bid. VEGAS MOON
lacked early speed, raced two wide into the turn, a bit off the rail into the drive and never made an impact. CALDER VALE threw his head at the start to
come away a step slow, navigated the turn four wide and could not find the needed response when called upon. MUSICAL GEM got bumped from inside at
the start, chased outside a rival, three wide into the turn, lacked room behind a pair of rivals past the quarter pole, came five wide into the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
MONTEBELLO set the pace under pressure from the outside, shook free from that rival at the three-eighths, inched away around the turn, tested in the final
sixteenth and held gamely. FLYING DRUMMER chased the speed outside a rival, went three wide around the turn, summoned a late bid in deep stretch but
could not get by. OVIATT CLASS settled off the pace early, took the turn three then four wide, went willingly through the final furlong but could not threaten
the top pair. DERECHO DANDY coaxed early from the gate, chased along the rail to the stretch and flattened out. RECAPTURED FREEDOM sat off the
pace early on, traveled on the inside into the turn, moved out into the two path around the bend and was never a factor. KATONAH pressed the pace from
outside up the backstretch, lost contact at the three-eighths and faded through the drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT JOSTAR angled to the inside early, went three wide into the backstretch, angled five wide leaving the second bend, rallied alongside with a
sixteenth remaining and proved best late. GENERAL MATHIS settled off the pace, raced between rivals on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch,
tipped out in upper stretch, rallied and got outclosed by the winner. OX BRIDGE brushed with inside rival while vying four deep leaving the chute, dropped
back to a stalking position and angled to the two path, went outside the pacesetter on the backstretch to apply pressure, dueled around the far turn and into
the stretch, held a narrow lead at the eighth pole and yielded late to the top pair. CANE CREEK ROAD vied for the lead between rivals leaving the chute
then ceded the lead and was rated on the inside, moved out into the two path for the far turn, remained two wide to the stretch, chased within striking
distance in the furlong grounds but finished evenly late. ZIPPY BABY angled to the inside early, settled off the pace, moved out and went between between
rivals but was put in tight quarters with a sixteenth remaining and could not regain momentum. UNCLE JEFF brushed leaving the chute while vying three
deep, dueled first time through the stretch before moving clear for the clubhouse turn, gained pressure on the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and
into the stretch, battled to the eighth pole and weakened late. GOOD BYE PUTIN tracked off the rail, went four wide on the far turn, lacked room behind
rivals in upper stretch and failed to rally after. CAPO MAFIOSO vied for the lead early then dropped back to stalk, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole
and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
ESCAPE ROUTE dueled with TOOK CHARGE from inside, battled down the stretch to the sixteenth pole, then edged clear late. TOOK CHARGE dueled
outside ESCAPE ROUTE into and around the turn, battled to the final sixteenth, yielded to the winner but was clearly second best. TRIBAL WAR CHANT
stalked on the inside then angled three wide on the turn and bested the rest. HOLDEN THE LUTE tracked off the inside, raced four to five wide around the
turn and failed to response to urging. HOLLYWOOD'S BEST chased the leaders two wide to the stretch and could not rally. BLACK BELT stalked the top
pair three wide to the turn, dropped back around the turn and weakened. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY coaxed early, dropped back from a lack of early speed,
raced off the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. BY MOONLIGHT lacked early speed, went four five wide around the turn and never made an impact.
DEPUTY GARY dropped back off the pace and never got involved.

Footnotes
LUCK was put in tight quarters and checked early, settled off the pace, came three wide into the stretch, tipped out further, closed fast and surged clear.
ENGLAND'S ROSE rated between rivals early, pushed upon midway around the turn, went three wide into the lane and finished well but had to settle for
second best. ZYDECO MAMA was closest in pursuit early in the two path, exited the far turn three wide and finished evenly for the show honors. SO MUCH
HAPPY sped clear early and angled in, set the pace along the rail, remained clear to the furlong grounds, run down in mid-stretch and weakened late. NEW
HEAT dropped back early, saved ground into the lane and advanced along the rail through the stretch. DEL MAR DRAMA crowded between rivals leaving
the chute and rank first time through the stretch, settled on the inside, went two wide into the stretch and could not rally. VELLA was rank early first time in
the stretch, stalked from inside to the lane, tipped out in upper stretch and flattened out. LADY NOGUEZ traveled in mid-pack early on off the rail, came four
wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) tracked outside a pair of rivals, steadied between foes past the quarter pole and
weakened.

Footnotes
PAPPACAP shifted in at the start, well placed early behind the top pair, angled five wide leaving the turn, struck the front in upper stretch, kicked clear with a
furlong remaining and drew off. FINNEUS dropped back early, took the turn four then five wide and rallied for the place. BET ON MOOKIE set the pace
under pressure from outside, dueled with rival around the turn and into the lane, was overtaken in upper stretch and kept on to hold the show. THIRSTY
ALWAYS broke out a bit, prompted the pace from outside, headed rival at the five-sixteenths, dueled to the stretch and weakened. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL
chased off the rail, three wide around the turn and lacked a rally. OUR EMPIRE off a bit slow to begin, never got involved, eased through the lane and
walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCESS GRACE raced in mid-pack early on, went between foes at the quarter pole, had to wait briefly leaving the turn, split foes at the top of the stretch,
kicked clear and held safely. DOGTAG unhurried in the beginning, traveled in the two path, came out and bumped rival into the stretch, drifted in
mid-stretch, closed well but could not threaten the winner. MAXIM RATE angled down to the two path early then moved inside on the clubhouse turn, tipped
out into the stretch, finished willingly but was no match for the top pair. BODHICITTA (GB) settled on the inside, shifted out leaving the far turn, altered out
with a furlong to go and kept on to earn a minor award. KEEPER OFTHE STARS settled off the pace, got forced out and bumped into the stretch and could
not make an impact late. CHARMAINE'S MIA tracked from inside to the stretch, slipped through inside rival at the top of the stretch but faltered in the final
furlong. LAURA'S LIGHT in range early outside rivals or three wide, raced outside a rival on the backstretch, tipped five wide in upper stretch and
weakened. BROOKE (CHI) stalked in the two path, took aim three wide into the lane, steadied briefly off heels inside the eighth pole and faded.
RAYMUNDOS SECRET set the pace on the inside, roused into the lane, overtaken in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
UNCAGED KITTY sped clear from outside, remained unchallenged to the stretch, then powered away under some right-handed encouragement and hand
urging. GRAZENINSTILETTOS was off slow to begin, advanced up the backstretch and around the turn, came four wide into the lane and finished well to
best the rest. SWEET SONNY shifted out leaving the gate, chased three deep up the backstretch, took aim on the leader three wide into the lane, could not
summon the needed response and was outfinished for the place. SWEET AND CHEEKY stumbled leaving the gate, settled on the inside, angled out and
clipped heels at the quarter pole, came three wide into the stretch and churned on to round out the superfecta. DYNAMITE QUEEN raced in mid-pack early,
traveled three then two wide on the turn, angled out in the stretch and never threatened. KATIE'S PARADISE got bumped on both sides at the start, chased
between foes then three wide into the lane and lacked further response. HOT AND A MESS settled off the pace outside rivals, navigated the turn five wide
and failed to rally. SLEW'S SCREEN STAR got bumped leaving the gate, squeezed between rivals early, traveled five then six wide on the turn and was
never a factor. MY TIGRESS chased in the two path to the stretch and faded. LIFE'S EMOTIONS stumbled leaving the gate but came away quickly, chased
the lone leader four deep early, five to four wide on the turn and weakened. BATHORY broke out and bumped at the start, traveled four into the turn, moved
down to the two path around the bend and came up empty. WAR MAIDEN hit the inner part of the gate and tossed his head at the start and failed to
menace.
