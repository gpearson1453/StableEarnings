KIERKEGAARD tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in the opening stages, made a steady advance on that foe to challenge for command in upper stretch,
wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under pressure. GREATER CAIRO, urged clear outside foes in the opening stages, set
the pace along the inside racing into the turn, but proved no match when confronted by the winner in the drive. J J'S CROWN tracked the pacesetter along
the inside racing to the turn but offered no rally.

SHINNY broke readily, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the first turn, was headed midway through the backstretch, was prompted to
turn back the challenge of TASHKENT racing into upper stretch and edged away under firm encouragement. DERBY CODE angled to the inside tracking off
the first flight racing to the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders while tipping out three wide in upper stretch and continued with interest to prove
best of the others. TASHKENT, urged prompting SHINNY to the backstretch, was urged to press the issue after a half into the far turn and gave out
midstretch. BOBBY BABY, off slowly, switched outside a rival tracking off the first flight to the backstretch and steadily faded on the far turn.

Footnotes
CREATIVE PLAN was rated off the second flight while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground gaining position inside foes nearing the
lane, tipped outside the pacesetter in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to prevail under strong handling. CZECHMIGHT, urged along
the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin to the backstretch, held sway under prompting past midstretch, resisted the winner to late stages but proved
only second best. OMEN OF CHANGE settled last while angling inside racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes nearing the far turn, was prompted
to advance four wide on the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for a share. ITS A BOY tracked the
pacesetter outside a rival in second flight in the three path to the far turn and faded into the stretch. COPPER FIDDLE, forwardly placed between foes
tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, was prompted to make a brief bid on the far turn and emptied out leaving midstretch.
DANCERONTHEBEACH broke awkwardly, was pulled up just after the start, then was vanned off the course.

BIRDIE BE GONE broke readily, prompted the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, took over racing past midstretch and went clear under firm
encouragement. DUSTY FORD was urged inside the eventual winner dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled inside that foe into upper stretch but
proved no match late. ADDED DIAMONDS angled inside tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, tipped out in upper stretch but couldn't close the gap
on the top pair while prevailing for a share. HOLY SOUL settled off the second flight in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and passed
inside tiring rivals late. LIL HOLY OAK switched off the inside early tracking off the second flight, shifted out four wide racing into the lane but offered no
rally. CHARLIES MISSILE tracked just off the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing into the turn, appeared to lose her action and emptied out racing
into upper stretch.

Footnotes
GEMSTONE GAL, tracked just off the leaders along the inside into the turn, steadied avoiding close quarters nearing the backstretch, switched out to track
the leaders three deep between foes to the second bend, was prompted to advance in that path racing into the far turn, bid for command between foes in
upper stretch and edged forward under pressure to prevail. LADY ASTRID broke readily to gain terms with the first flight racing to the first turn, was eased
off the leaders racing to the backstretch, was prompted to regain contention splitting foes racing into upper stretch and edged rivals for the place honors.
COME ON SWEET PEA tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to
upper stretch to challenge midstretch but was outkicked. TIMEINTHETAVERN joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards nearing the
backstretch forcing the pace outside a rival, continued to press the issue in the two path into the far turn, then to upper stretch and gave way between foes
late. SHIP'S CREEK, urged along the rail prompting the pace into the first turn, steadied in close quarters near the six furlong marker, continued to prompt
the pace through the backstretch, shifted a bit off the inside near the quarter mile marker, angled back to the rail to bid inside foes while caught in close
quarters entering the stretch, then was taken up in the closing stages when losing his path late. INCLUDEANATTITUDE settled along the inside early and
failed to menace. RAGGEDY DOLL PEACH was rated between foes racing to the first turn, made brief progress between foes on the backstretch and
emptied out entering the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY HIDEAWAY was rated along the inside tracking behind the second flight, continued under patient handling into the second bend while dropping out
last, tipped out in upper stretch to split foes just off the inside, then surged inside rivals in the closing stages to wrest a narrow advantage in time under
strong handling. APPLE DAPPLE settled along the inside in the opening half, swung out four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn while being
prompted to advance, continued with a steady advance outside foes in that path to challenge for command but was just outkicked. FIRSTMATE, forwardly
placed attending a rival's pace in the opening half, pressed the issue between foes into upper stretch while exchanging contact with JEN TAKE CHARGE
and was just outkicked by the top pair. LUVIN BULLIES settled between foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance between foes, then
shifted five wide in the closing stages while making a belated response to gain some position. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER sped to the lead between foes
racing to the first turn, dictated the pace to the second bend, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and yielded in the final sixteenth. GRAND PRIZE tracked
just off the pacesetter along the inside, saved ground on the far turn and faded into the stretch. JEN TAKE CHARGE was settled outside foes in early
stages, was urged with an early move to advance four wide after a half, bid three deep between foes into upper stretch, was bumped nearing the furlong
marker and emptied out early.

THICK HAZE was rated along the inside tracking off the first flight racing to the far turn, came through inside foes to challenge for command when presented
an opening in upper stretch, wrested the advantage and drove clear. HOLD THE SPICE settled last along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground
to upper stretch and made solid late progress to gain the place honors inside foes nearing the wire. IMA HARLEY TOO tracked the leaders outside rivals in
second flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide on the far turn to upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. HOT ARTIE sped to
the lead along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, dueled inside foes shifting off the rail racing into the stretch and gave out in
late stages. BUBBA BOB, forwardly placed between foes attending the pace, pressed the issue between foes on the far turn into upper stretch and gave
way. TRI SPOT settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. CARAMEL ANGEL

SO ALIVE was settled into stride while switching off the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance shifting out three wide nearing upper
stretch, then produced a stout rally to reel in the pacesetter in time under firm handling to prevail. MINNESOTA LUCKY broke readily, sped clear of the field
while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a comfortable margin to midstretch, resisted the winner's bid to the end but just missed. IRISH MAJOR
angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and continued well enough to
prevail for a share. FORMIDABLE FORCE, off slowly, settled well off the leaders racing to the far turn, angled out racing into upper stretch and made some
