APOLLO BAY settled well, advanced on the far turn, rallied while four wide in the stretch and was along in time. COBYMEISTER assumed command, held
well into the stretch and was worn down in the late going. TAP THE BRAKES stalked the pace, remained in contention turning for home and came up empty
in the stretch. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was knocked back at the start, trailed and managed a belated rally for a minor share. LITE SWITCH never menaced.
SWAMPDRAINER ducked out at the start and showed little.

DRILL'S LI'L MAN raced in striking position along the inside, was angled off the rail into the stretch, found a seam, rallied and was wrapped up in the late
going. COROT set a contested pace, edged clear turning for home and proved no match in the last sixteenth. RUMPOLE bobbled at the start, was
squeezed early, stalked the pace and came up empty in the stretch run. FAYETTE WARRIOR lacked a rally. REBOUNDER chased along the inside and
faded.

SABRIA stalked the pace, moved to the front leaving the turn and held sway thereafter. OLIVE OYL awash with sweat in the preliminaries, settled well,
moved closer on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. BUG A BOO slammed into at the start, trailed early, commenced her bid on the turn and rallied while
five wide in the stretch. CHARM AND SARCASM came out at the start bumping BUG A BOO and posed no threat. SWANKY LISA was always outrun.
EMILY'S IRISH ROSE led early and dropped back on the turn.

showed little. PAPA'S SECRET ducked in at the start and did not factor. POLAR'S GRACE bobbled at the start and was outrun.
