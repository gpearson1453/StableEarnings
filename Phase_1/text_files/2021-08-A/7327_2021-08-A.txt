DIVINE TASK broke sharply to set the clear pace from the two path and drew clear under a drive. WHERE'S FREDDIE tracked the leader from the two path
but was no match for the winner. E'S BIRTHDAY BOY stalked the pace from the inside to be the best of rest. MR. WIPE OUT chased the leaders from the
three path but lacked a late response. PAPA CASE was unhurried early from the inside and improved position late. STREET BULL was close up early and
faded late. WILDCATINJEANS failed to menace. MACHO SANCHO was no factor.

FINAL DESIGN was rushed to the lead from the inside and just lasted. GLOBAL EXCHANGE vied for the lead from the three path and just missed. HAPPY
ISSUE was in tight after the break and had to steady then was allowed to settle from the two path then angled out in the stretch to make a late rally for the
show. PRINCESS JAZZ pressed the pace from the two path and weakened in the drive. MAGIC MOMENT was away alertly then dropped back and was
never a factor.

BUBBAS DIXIE set the pace from the inside then cleared the field and drew off. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was allowed to settle from the two path then
steadily advanced to slip through on the rail in the final turn then angled out for the drive but flattened out. BEHOLD THAT WORD was unhurried early and
saved ground on the inside then made a late rally up the rail to be up for show. WAY OUT WEST raced in the middle of the pack then made a mild bid on
the final turn but was empty in the drive. L. A. TOWER vied for the lead from the three path for three quarters and gave way in the stretch. SENOR BLAIR
pressed the pace from the two path for a half and tired in the final turn.
