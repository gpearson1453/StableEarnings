Footnotes
WEATHERFORD broke out and bumped CHEVAL DORE at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, kicked clear nearing the lane and held
clear under a drive. TUTANKHAMUNATCHA raced two wide in midpack and rallied through the lane to gain the place in the final strides. CHEVAL DORE
was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from the rail, continued on the left lead and was one-paced in the lane. VICMAR was bumped soon after the start,
raced off the pace three wide and finished well too late. ABHAR pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the final furlong. SMOOTH MUSIC saved
ground off the pace, angled three wide near the quarter pole and had a mild belated rally. MASTER Q saved ground to no avail. BELLA FUTURE chased
the pace three wide and faded through the stretch. NONA RAC hit the starting gate then steadied off heels soon after, raced two wide and made little
impact. FINDING MISCHIEF was outrun inside. BLAME CHARLIE was bumped soon after the start and never a threat while racing four wide. FADO
hesitated at the start and was always well back while tending to get out. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED WITH FRACTIONS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
J'S INDIAN CHARM sprinted to the front with an alert getaway, saved ground into the stretch and stayed clear under pressure. SIMPLIFY (ARG) pressed
the pacesetter from outside, bid after three furlongs, could not get by and ran on second best. CHUTZPAH broke slowly and lagged far back for
three-eighths of a mile, moved out in the stretch and finished with good energy. TEE UP saved ground on the turn, moved out for the drive and finished
evenly. K'S RUNNING FREE was a step slow to begin, and failed to menace three to four wide. TAYLOR'S IN ORBIT raced two to three wide around the
turn, and drifted out tiring in the stretch.

Footnotes
ON THIN ICE set the pace inside, drew off in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened under moderate urging. ELDON'S PRINCE
raced two wide in midpack, tipped three wide in upper stretch and stayed on to gain the place. T VILLE had early speed inside of the winner, steadied as
that foe cleared midway around the first turn, tipped out early on the backstretch, advanced between foes to press the pace, could not keep pace with the
winner in upper stretch but continued on willingly inside to save the show. EYE ON THE CANDY was in range three wide, moved into second in upper
stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. CLASSIC FILM saved ground off the early pace, lost momentum when on heels midway around the first turn as
T VILLE steadied, advanced under urging down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and came up empty in the lane. ALWAYS ABOVE was
sluggish early, raced well back inside, circled five wide around the far turn and lacked a stretch rally. GRABBING THE MONEY failed to menace while
racing four wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn. KISS PRINCIPAL played no factor while racing three wide. SOULFUL SONG was up
close three wide and was through after a half. BORRELLY was reluctant to load and was through early.

Footnotes
DIMENNA pressed the early pace inside, moved out to take a run at CAPTAIN with five-sixteenths remaining, overpowered that rival from outside into the
stretch and drove clear. CAPTAIN sprinted clear early in the two-path, proved no match for the winner turning for home, and stayed clear for the place on
his left lead. PROUD CONTENDER was outsprinted early, saved ground into the stretch and had a mild response to pick up the show. PIYPA DE LYNDA
lost his footing at the break and was bumped by TIME TO WISH, and could not gain through the lane outside rivals. TIME TO WISH broke out into PIYPA
DE LYNDA, chased outside early, and faded after a half-mile. BILLY YANK broke slowly and was outrun three wide. MUTARAAFEQ was hustled from the
gate, paused briefly in tight along the rail exiting the chute, and dropped far back after a half. DALIO was finished early inside.

Footnotes
FULMINI stalked the duel in the clear inside, tipped three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, took over three deep leaving the quarter pole, put away the
pacesetters nearing the eighth pole and dug in to repel KARTANO'S late charge. KARTANO trailed inside for a half, advanced three wide around the far
turn, closed outside but could not get past the winner. EXCHANGE DAY dueled inside of BRIGHT DEVIL to upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the
lane, could not match strides with the top two and held well enough for the show. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) dueled two wide to upper stretch, continued on the
left lead and tired. TODAYSTHEDAY was outrun inside. BOCA GUY hopped at the start, chased the pace three wide around the first turn then steadily
faded.

Footnotes
UNCAPTURED KING was unhurried early inside, moved out three or four wide taking closer order around the turn, moved back in past the three-sixteenths,
got through on the rail inside CAPTURED BY FATE leaving the furlong grounds and edged away under vintage handling. SEA TRIDENT stalked the early
leaders in the clear three wide, challenged outside CAPTURED BY FATE five-sixteenths out, reached a short lead through midstretch, and saved the place.
NIMBLE BEAST bumped with TIMEWON'TLETMEGO after the start, advanced around the turn four then five wide, loomed on the far outside with a furlong
remaining and stayed on well. HANDSOME PRINCE improved four wide after a half-mile, but could not sustain the rally. CAPTURED BY FATE broke
inward, vied outside FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL early, got the best of that one on the turn, responded when hooked from outside by SEA TRIDENT going to the
quarter-pole, then gave way past the furlong marker. FITZ'S MO raced in the second flight early, came four wide off the turn and made no impact. SHAKEM
N BREAKEM was a step slow at the start, and never got close. STARSHIP TAXI saved ground to no avail. ONE TURN JOHNNY got squeezed back
between horses at the start, and never recovered. TIMEWON'TLETMEGO bumped with NIMBLE BEAST after the start, and faded three wide before
reaching the stretch. ANDREW THE BULL was a step slow to begin, and remained well in arrears. FIRST NAVY ADMIRAL was forced in at the break but
away alertly, vied inside CAPTURED BY FATE to the turn, and gave way.

Footnotes
DEAR MAMA MIA broke on top despite stumbling and bumping with LULI'S DANCER, pursued KUMANDRA from outside to the turn, took over after a
half-mile, dug in when challenged by SEQUIN LADY in the stretch, and held on through a long drive while drifting out. LULI'S DANCER got bumped by
DEAR MAMA MIA at the start, stayed in range four then five wide to the top of the stretch, kept on with good courage while drifting out and just missed
outside rivals. SEQUIN LADY was never far back, came under a ride looming a threat outside DEAR MAMA MIA past the five-sixteenths, got outdueled
through deep stretch and settled for the show between the top two. HARPER BE GOOD moved in a bit from the three-path approaching the stretch, and
could not reach contention with an even finish. HAD A NICE WEEKEND was slowest away and outrun for a half two wide, and passed only tired horses.
BEMBE took a couple awkward steps along the rail just past the five-eighths pole, and could not reach contention. KUMANDRA set the early pace inside,
got overtaken shortly before completing a half, and gave way. YES I'M SPITEFUL came five wide off the turn well back, and remained outrun. KISS UPON
A STAR raced wide and was through after a half. MOONLIGHT TANGO dropped far back inside on the turn, was pulled up in the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DAHLONEGA stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained outside through the lane, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. HEIR BALL
set a pressured pace inside, kicked clear in upper stretch, was under hand urging through the lane, led to the sixteenth pole and yielded soon after.
AVENIDA MANANA chased the pace inside, lacked the needed rally but was up for the show. STORMY NELLY raced two wide in midpack, angled four
wide nearing the quarter pole and had a mild stretch gain. KATIELEIGH pressed the pace two wide to upper stretch and weakened. I'M
PRAYINGFORTHAT failed to menace while racing four to five wide. TONY'S ROSE saved ground to no avail. THINKIN COWTOWN raced off the pace
three wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and lacked a bid. THE GREAT KATH steadied early, raced two wide and made little impact. DISTINCTLY
BLUE was outrun while racing four wide. MISS MIAMI played no factor while racing three wide. THE OTHER CAT was outrun inside.

Footnotes
SHINY EMPIRE broke two lengths slow, lagged far, far back through the first half-mile, angled to the far outside beginning to pick it up coming off the turn,
rallied down the center of the track and swept past a spent CAFFEINE RUSH in deep stretch to win going away. GAGA OH LA LA chased three wide in
striking distance to the stretch, stayed on task and was up outside CAFFEINE RUSH for the place. CAFFEINE RUSH sped off early, widened the advantage
through fast fractions, grew leg weary through the furlong grounds and had nothing left 70 yards out while able to save the show. BETWEEN DREAMS
advanced around the turn two wide getting closest to the pacesetter, but weakened through the last eighth of a mile. MISS ITALY was outsprinted early,
raced three to four wide around the turn, and passed tired horses. ROMANTICAL NOTE moved off the inside far back around the turn, and went by tired
foes. SWEET BABY RAELYNN improved position after a half-mile four wide, but gave way in the stretch. GOODBYE GABY broke out bumping VIVA LA
REINA, and faded steadily inside after a quarter-mile. JADA'S KINGDOM was no factor three wide. PATRICK'S LASS bumped with VIVA LA REINA at the
start, steadied early in traffic, and tired. VIVA LA REINA got bumped between horses at the start, chased after CAFFEINE RUSH early, and faltered before
reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
KARENVILLE stalked the pace three wide, steadily gained through the lane, struck the front leaving the sixteenth marker and held off TOURING EGYP'S
late charge. TOURING EGYPT hopped at the start, raced off the pace two wide, knifed between foes in the lane, surged late and just missed. YAMBOREE
QUEEN prompted the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, led past the sixteenth pole and weakened late.
EARNESTINE N HAZEL (IRE) raced off the pace two and three wide, swung out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was outkicked.
PANOTTI saved ground off the pace and ran on inside without seriously threatening. FASTLIFE was in range inside and lacked a closing bid. BLUE EYE
KITTEN failed to menace while racing four wide. PRETTY PRINCESS slammed into the starting gate, saved ground well back, went four wide around the
far turn and never threatened. STREAKING GREY had her head turned at the start and broke in the air, chased the pace three and four wide and lacked a
bid. PORT EVE set the pace along the rail and gave way near the five-sixteenths pole. ALLSYSTEMSAREAGO steadied early, raced four and five wide and
was through after a half. CENTRAL PARK GIRL had some speed four wide but was through early.
