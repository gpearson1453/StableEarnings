Footnotes
BUILDING HOME closest to the leader in the run up the backstretch,challenged that one midway on the turn, dueled through upper stretch and past the
furlong marker, wore that same rival down late before holding the runner up safe in the waning strides. TRACK SMART last away, settled off the pace and
the inside, came three wide out of the turn under a left handed crop, up late for the place while slowly getting the winner at the wire. SUMMERTIME BANDIT
sprinted clear soon after the start, responded when the winner came alongside midway on the bend, dueled through upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly
until late, caught for the place. LUKES SECRET fell back soon after the start, trailed much of the way in failing to threaten. ARKANSAS BLING raced back
off the pace, also failed to muster a serious response in the drive.

FULL OF RUN allowed the pace to go early off the inside, ranged up into contention while four wide exiting the final turn, outside inside the furlong grounds,
edging away late under steady handling. LIAM SKYE closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, advanced three wide on that pair late in the final turn, put
a head in front nearing the furlong marker, led, could not contain the winner, well clear of the others. HONOR MY SPEED broke out, alternated up front in
the two path, weakened steadily when confronted for the drive to prove no match for the top pair. RUSTON VOW broke on top, alternated up front closest to
the inside for six furlongs, first to blink entering the stretch. VICTOR LOUNGE (IRE) in tight at the start, trailed throughout, far back, jogged in late.
OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

DREWZANO forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch off the inside, advanced and challenged midway on the turn, extended drive, inched away late
under firm handling. O'L RED broke on top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch toward the inside, dueled with the winner into and through upper
stretch, proved stubborn to the end, clearly second best. WHENTHEDOVESCRY lacked early foot, worked way toward the rail, improved inside of the two
remaining rivals to account for the show, not a serious threat to the top pair. PURE VALOR last to leave, moved up to within striking distance off the inside,
lacked a closing punch. HOORAY AUSTIN tired while racing outside.

Footnotes
GIMMEASOUND broke with the leaders, fell back to race in the second flight outside, advanced to a striking position in the four path late in the turn,
challenged entering the stretch, drew clear the final furlong under steady pressure. ADIEU LE CHAT broke back, lacked early foot, in some traffic toward the
inside late in the turn, steered out widest for the drive, finished up willingly to be in time for the place. JAMAICAN ME also broke back off the lead pack,
advanced three and outside of traffic late in the turn, flattened out a bit in the drive to lose the place spot late. SIGN OF WAR broke out, was quickly
straightened to contest the issue up front closest to the inside, continued to vie into the lane, faltered the final furlong. TIGARD BABES forwardly placed off
the inside, advanced to challenge three wide midway on the turn, faltered in the drive. EXTRAPOLATOR in mid pack early, raced in traffic and steadied in
tight quarters exiting the turn, fell back and did not recover. CRESCENT CITY CAT dueled early off the inside, stopped from between foes midway on the
turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
MISTER STRANGE took command along the inside early in the first turn under his own courage, rated in the run up the backstretch, shrugged off a couple
of foes midway on the final turn, drew well clear through the lane under a steady right handed crop. LOVE THAT WARRIOR off a step slow, raced back
early as a result, steadily advanced through the second turn, inside challenge for the for the place upper stretch, proved game for that position while not a
threat to the winner late. EL WARD asked to keep up just outside the winner into the first turn, closest to that one up the backstretch, crept closer in the far
turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive outkicked for the second spot. D TOWN BABY lacked early foot, continued to lag in the run up the
backstretch, improved position through the lane while not a serious threat. AMBASSADOR HOUSE four wide into the first turn, raced in mid pack, steered
out to be four wide again late in the final bend, came up empty for the stretch run. STARVICTORY within striking distance for five furlongs, had little left for
the stretch run. VALIANT DEFENDER remained back in failing to threaten. CIVIL SERVANT forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat after a half.
OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
THAT'S D 'CAT sprinted clear into the first turn, set the pace in hand up the backstretch, repelled a rival turning for home to be clear again when
straightened for home, enough left to the hold the runner up safe late. BINDING unhurried in the early going, steered out to be four wide entering the stretch,
finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. TRIVISTA settled early off the winner, advanced with a middle move on that
rival in the second turn, closest with a quarter mile remaining, hung in the drive to be overtaken for the pace, saved the show. COOL INDIVIDUAL within
striking distance for a half, fell back through the second half of the final turn off the inside, coming again late for the show. ARCHIE chased the winner for
five furlongs toward the inside and weakened. SOCIAL MISFIT four wide into the first turn when off the pace, raced three wide up the backstretch and into
the far turn, floated out a bit by the runner up to be four wide again late in that bend, remained back in failing to rally. SHAE'S DAY last away, trailed
throughout in showing little, jogged in. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

QUEST FOR AVETTE close from the start off the inside, shook clear into the turn, expanded that advantage into the lane, enough left late to hold off the
runner up. TRIPPER JOHN broke back, lacked early foot, moved outside and lodged a bold move four wide to reach contention turning for home, lost
ground to the winner as a result into the stretch, coming again late to close the gap. SUGARLAND EXPRESS lacked speed, roused three wide when
beginning to advance exiting the turn, continued willingly to the end to be closing the gap on the top two. BERNIE SPECIAL under went a shoe repair in the
paddock, raced one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. NINE SHOTS in mid pack early, fell back before three furlongs. BIG BAND'S LUCK
chased the winner early, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
ZARAZI settled off the early pace and the inside, continued unhurried the middle half when losing a bit of position, four wide out of the final turn, finished full
of run down the middle of the strip to win going away. CRYPTORITHM took command off the inside into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch and
through the final turn, shook off a rivals into the lane, continued to lead by daylight past the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late, held sway
for the runner up position. R AND R STAR broke on top, raced forwardly while saving ground, lacked a winning response in the drive. UNBRIDLED PULPIT
settled in mid pack while off the inside, continued in even fashion through the stretch while remaining off the rail. DARK MATTER chased the winner for five
furlongs, brief bid outside the runner up turning for home, gave way in the drive. COWBOY BRAD raced back while five wide into the first turn, lodged a
middle move to briefly reach striking position late in the final turn, faltered in the drive. PRINCE CARLOS underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, broke in
the air and remained back. WHEELS TURNING four wide when back into the first turn, trailed throughout in showing little. OPENING QUARTER MILE
FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
