Footnotes
MYSTIC EYES established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper
stretch, drew off under a drive to prevail. I'M SO SORRY coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside
through the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch, tucked to the two or three path nearing the sixteenth pole and offered up late foot to close in and
secure the place honors. MOSTLY HARMLESS lunged at the break, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. COST A FORTUNE grew fractious in the gate just after LOVE UNLIMITED grew fractious when waiting for that
rival to settle down, got bumped at the start by RAW HONEY, who broke outwards, tucked inside soon after the start pinching that rival out against LOVE
UNLIMITED, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, spun three wide for home and weakened. OFFICE
ETIQUETTE chased two then three wide in close aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and
weakened. RAW HONEY broke out at the start bumping COST A FORTUNE, then got pinched back between foes and was forced to be taken hold off just
after the start conceding three lengths to the front, chased three wide under a ride from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no
impact. LOVE UNLIMITED fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased along the inside from the tail of the field, cornered three wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. WHATRUWAITINGFOR chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DANNY DEEP CUTS broke out then was hustled, pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead coming to
the quarter-pole, kicked clear when set down in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop into the final furlong, drew away under a drive into the final
sixteenth, had the rider lose his crop when putting it away late and proved much the best. CAPTIVATING CARA set the pace under pressure from two foes
on the outside, vied along the rail while still inside opponents on the turn, was asked while losing the lead to the winner coming to the quarter-pole and
proved no match while clear for the place. MOON OVER NY broke a step slow, moved out while hard ridden off the pace, dropped in leaving the
backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. QUEENTIGUA settled off the pace then moved
out at the nine-sixteenths, dropped back four wide under urging on the turn, lugged out some under extra left-rein pressure while spinning five wide into the
stretch and failed to respond. BOOMKITTYBYEBYE was urged along on the inside, dropped back while ground on the turn, was driven three wide into the
stretch and failed to rally. FASTELLE stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, pressed the pace between horses, vied in the two path while still between
foes on the turn, was crowded a bit while dropping back at the five-sixteenths, chased four wide into the stretch, fell back while still on her inside lead to the
furlong marker and tired. DECREED broke a step slow then dropped back, was urged along at the rear on the outside, traveled around the turn in the two
path, came four wide into the stretch, moved further out before the furlong marker and was no factor.

Footnotes
DISCRETIONARY MARQ broke out at the start filling the space vacated by the breaking outwards FULL SALUTE, tracked the pace along the inside in
closest aim down the backstretch before advancing on a clear rail through the turn to take command five-sixteenths from home, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under a drive turning back NEW YORK'S FINEST when confronted by MYSTERY MESSENGER and gamely
fended off that rival holding him at sway to prevail at the end. MYSTERY MESSENGER three wide in pursuit, got set down angled four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong latching on to the outside but was ultimately repelled to the finish while clear for the place
honors. WAR STROLL broke in at the start bumping CHIMNEY ROCK before taking over that rival's lane in concert with MYSTERY MESSENGER due to
pressure inside from FULL SALUTE, chased three then two wide, got let out angled four to five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. CHIMNEY
ROCK bumped at the start by WAR STROLL, lost his lane when that rival came together lightly with MYSTERY MESSENGER as pressure inside from
FULL SALUTE had that rival nudged outwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and kept
on through to the finish. NEW YORK'S FINEST broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under
pressure midway on the turn before being headed at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive between rivals and weakened in the
late stages. FULL SALUTE broke out at the start nudging MYSTERY MESSENGER into the lane of CHIMNEY ROCK in tandem with pressure from WAR
STROLL from the outside forcing CHIMNEY ROCK to lose his lane, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ENCRYPTED (GB) leapt up at the start brushing the near side stall and conceded three lengths to the front
before being able to settle into stride, chased along the inside advancing quickly to mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went three wide
for home, then weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
PANSTER settled comfortably on the inside, was roused early on the final turn, came off the rail into the stretch then steadied briefly off heels, dropped back
to the rail at that point then rallied under a right-handed crop, closed well to make a bid around the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong urging. TURN OF
EVENTS slipped into the two path entering the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, took the lead passing the
five-sixteenths, responded well when set down in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was denied while able to get the place. MADE
MY DAY (IRE) was taken in hand early then was reserved in the three path, came under urging on the far turn, rallied to make a bid in upper stretch, battled
on in the final furlong and missed but narrowly earned the show. MONTATHAM went three wide on the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked in
the two path on the far turn, gained under a drive to make a bid in upper stretch, fought with multiple foes in the final furlong and was outfinished.
CHULAINN bumped with a foe at the start, angled in at the rear of the field, raced inside to the two path under snug restraint on the first turn, was reserved
off the pace, traveled around the far turn in the two path while roused, was driven three wide into the stretch then quickly angled to the outside and finished
willingly. RISK MANAGER hit the outside of the gate hard at the start, went three wide on the initial turn, settled on the outside, was asked three wide on the
far turn then came four wide into the stretch and gained some but failed to impact. DEMO DOCTOR broke in and bumped with a foe at the start, saved
ground at the rear of the field, moved off the rail late on the far turn and failed to threaten. HANDY was corrected with a tug of the left-rein at the start then
taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the two path, was reserved towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, was given his cue around the
five-sixteenths and failed to rally. BAR FOURTEEN was hustled from the start, set the pace on the inside under pressure from the outside, was asked while
being headed late on the final turn and faded.

Footnotes
WARTIME HERO established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside narrowly when under pressure through the
presence of ASSEMBLY POINT to the outside, knocked heads with that rival down the backstretch and into the far turn albeit while both charges remained
unhurried, began to slip away near the five-sixteenths, floated two then three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive drifting out through the stretch
about six paths to the finish while kept lightly to task. CHASE TRACKER away forwardly placed, had pressure get applied outside from ASSEMBLY POINT
looking to tuck inwards about a sixteenth into the race was put in tight and bumped between foes getting taken hold of in concert with MAGNIFICENT
CHROME as SUPER WICKED CHARM was forced to check out of the seam, went three then two wide into the first turn getting forced to steady off the
heels of ASSEMLY POINT as that rival now successfully tucked in front, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing just past the
seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. OPERATIVE
bobbled at the break, recovered to chase just off the inside from just off the pace, came under coaxing tipped three to four wide at the seven-sixteenths,
swung five wide for home and improved position for the show honors despite then weakened in the late stages. SUPER WICKED CHARM got put in tight
between foes a sixteenth into the race and was forced to check out when off heels of a rival, went two then three wide through the first turn before taking to
the four path down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes. SWINGING
STICKS three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. ASSEMBLY POINT
(BRZ) forwardly placed four wide into the first turn, attempted to tuck and forced a trio of rivals to be put in tight a sixteenth into the race, went four wide into
the turn and tucked three wide forcing a pair of rivals to steady off his heels one mile from home then advanced to knock heads in hand just off the inside
with WARTIME HERO to his inside, applied pressure through his presence down the backstretch and into the far turn until shaken off nearing the
five-sixteenths, came under urging at that juncture, swung three to four wide for home and gave way. Z'FINALE five wide into the first turn, tucked four then
three wide through that bend settling three wide in aim of the top pair, came under urging at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and faltered.
MAGNIFICENT CHROME stumbled at the start and recovered to be in between foes when forced to steady as the path grew tight due to pressure outside
from ASSEMBLY POINT, got steadied once more one mile from home as that rival tucked in front, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung six wide for home and folded.

Footnotes
BUTTER LOU broke a half-step slow, chased the leading duo from third, tucked into the two path on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, rallied to
the lead outside the furlong marker and proved best under steady urging then was injured on the gallop-out and vanned off. NO TIME ALONE disputed the
pace on the outside of OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT, bumped with that foe outside the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two to three path on the turn, gained a short
lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner while still on her inside lead outside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead inside that marker
and was outfinished but earned the place. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT dropped back while taken up after the start, was urged along towards the rear, saved
ground on most of the turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, swung five wide into the stretch, drifted out some under a left-handed crop inside the
furlong marker then was switched to a right-handed crop, swapped back to her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and finished willingly for the show.
DISENGAGE was away alertly, disputed the pace on the inside of NO TIME ALONE. bumped with that opponent outside the seven-sixteenths, vied along
the rail on the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. ERIDROMOS chased the early pace on
the outside then dropped back, went three then four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. BORIMAN was slow into stride, fell far
behind the rest of the field, went around the turn in the three path and was distanced.

MR. KRINGLE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack among the main body of the field well behind a spurting leader, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, altered out as the incident unfolded in front and rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong
taking command just inside the sixteenth marker, then inched away to the finish kept to task. LORD FLINTSHIRE just off the inside at the tail of the field,
tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the inside before tipping
out inside the eighth pole to the three path and just got up for the place honors in the final jumps. CALIBOGEE broke out a step at the start bumping
SPECTATORLESS, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, tipped out and altered around the fallen
rider near the eighth pole, ran on to secure the show honors. LANDBISCUIT coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, altered out as the incident happened in concert with the aforementioned foes nearing the eighth pole and
assumed command at that station, dug in under threat, got collared just inside the sixteenth marker and got outfinished in the late stages. BAD GUY coaxed
from the gate, went three wide through the first turn before settling six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the far turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild kick. SIDD FINCH just off the inside through the first turn, raced five paths
off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and made no
headway. LIFE ON TOP just off the inside through the first turn, went four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then tucked to the two path through
the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, got paused and taken in hand as the incident unfolded in front and was placed to a light
protective hold along the rail and not persevered with to the finish. PUBLIC INFORMATION broke out at the start and was corrected, chased four then three
wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. MYSTERY BANK struck the off side stall at the start, chased three
then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, altered out nearing the eighth pole gingerly stepping around the
fallen rider and was not persevered with to the finish. SPECTATORLESS bumped at the start by CALIBOGEE who broke outwards, established the front
under light coaxing and showed the way just off the inside spurting away from the rest of the field once into the backstretch, opened up a commanding lead
and tucked to the inside through the far turn, had the field begin to take closer order nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch roused,
received a right handed tap and was show the crop to the off side and shied in striking the temporary rail just outside the eighth pole and losing the rider in
the process forcing a quintet of rivals to alter course and pause, ran off rider less and was apprehended by the outrider and was subsequently vanned off.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the incident involving SPECTATORLESS before the result was allowed to stand the race was
declared official.

switched to a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, gained quickly into the final sixteenth and got up under strong handling. JOEY LOOSE LIPS moved in
while showing early speed, was taken back off the pace while along the rail on the first turn then rated just behind the leader, slipped through against the rail
inside the three-eighths to take the lead then kicked clear, was put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch, remained well clear into the final furlong, shortened
stride with a diminishing lead into the final sixteenth, switched to a right-handed crop shortly thereafter and was caught while clear for the place. OUR MAN

along into the far turn, vied in the two path on that bend, lost the advantage inside the three-eighths and tired. BUSTIN THE RULES broke in and brushed
with a foe, went four wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch

LONE ROCK attended the leader to the outside in the two path patiently handled applying sole pressure through his presence to the outside, spun just off
the inside for home and was roused to take command straightened away into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. SHOOGER RAY TOO just
off the top pair three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung three to four wide for home and offered up a mild kick.
MORETTI coaxed from the gate, showed the way rated along the inside under the watchful eye of LONE ROCK latched on to the outside, remained on hold
until given some rein to work with near the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch roused, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the
final furlong. ROCKETRY saved ground near the rear through the first turn before going past the stands two to three wide the first turn, tucked inside
through the second turn and remained along the rail down the backstretch before tipping two to three wide at the half mile pole placed to coaxing, advanced
through the last turn and spun three wide into upper stretch, couldn't sustain the move and tired in the drive. RY'S THE GUY bumped at the start by HE'S
NO LEMON, who broke inwards, chased just off the inside coming under urging three furlongs from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch
and tired. YOU'RE TO BLAME chased three to four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased
home through to the finish. HE'S NO LEMON broke in at the start bumping RY'S THE GUY, chased along the inside near the rear of the field coming under
coaxing half a mile from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, gave way and was eased home to the wire. Please note the split time for a
mile and a half was not recorded nor made available by teletimer. The split for one mile and a half was hand timed the following day.

Footnotes
LOOKIN TO FLY was rated while well placed on the inside, drafted behind horses on the far turn, moved out while asked in upper stretch, closed well to get
the lead inside the furlong marker then moved clear under strong urging. MONDEUSE went to the front, showed the way with company to her outside while
inside to the two path, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, fought on well on the inside of LOVE'S
MISERY into the final furlong, lost the advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place. BELLA
PRINCIPESSA brushed with a rival at the start, raced under tight restraint while between foes in the two path through the opening bend, was reserved
towards the back, saved ground on the final turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter-pole, moved off the rail into upper stretch then altered back in
from behind horses and improved position to get the show. LOVE'S MISERY prompted the pace on the outside while two to three wide, was asked near the
quarter-pole then put to a drive in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. OUT OF SIGHT was recalcitrant behind the gate
and reluctant to load, brushed with a rival at the break, was taken under a tight hold early then reserved two to three wide, came four wide into the stretch
then moved further out and failed to rally. KILLOEAN ROSE broke a step slow, settled on the inside, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, saved
ground through the final turn and failed to threaten. SAIGON went four wide on the first turn, was reserved near the back on the outside, came under
encouragement in the three path on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response.
ESCAPEWITHFRIENDS went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, raced three then four wide while put to urging on the far turn and came
up empty. LADY MANHATTAN was hustled from the start after breaking last but one, bore out five wide and was taken up into the first turn, dropped to the
two path by late on that bend, lagged at the rear, went three wide on the far turn and was no factor.
