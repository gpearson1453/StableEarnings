Footnotes
DOC MEEKS was unhurried inside, swung out leaving the final turn, took over from the outside in midstretch and was clear at the end. PERFECT
HIDEAWAY wasn't far back early, raced the three path around the final turn, split rivals while closing inside the winner through the lane but couldn't keep up
late. WEE ARCH opened a clear lead soon after the break, angled to the rail, remained in control to the stretch then gave way. TINDER DATE ducked into
LOOP THE LOOP leaving the gate, pressed two wide outside the early leader, moved to a short lead in early stretch then faded past midstretch. LOOP THE
LOOP was bumped leaving the gate, was bumped into BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD while three wide between rivals into the first turn then was no factor.
BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD was bumped while unhurried four wide into the first turn, advanced outside into striking position before going a half then stopped
in the lane. AMEN SYLVIA steadied in tight nearing the first turn, came out, bumped LOOP THE LOOP then was no factor.

Footnotes
MY FRIEND FRANK settled inside, angled out entering the stretch while rallying then ran to the front in deep stretch. NO REGRETS made the early pace
inside, was displaced early on the backstretch, regained command two wide midway on the final turn, ran clear in early stretch then gave way late.
ESKENFORTIME was slow early, stayed out from the rail around the final turn and finished fast between horses. BIG RIG was unhurried inside and finished
willingly. GET A VALENTINE moved to the front from the outside early on the first turn, cleared, angled to the rail early on the backstretch, remained
prominent to the stretch then weakened. CAMGO wasn't far back outside into the far turn then stopped. CATTLE DRIVE raced in good position between
horses for about five furlongs then stopped. TRANSITIVE fell far back after a half.

JAYJAYDEE showed speed from the outset, took over before a half, drew clear early on the final turn, ran out entering the stretch and held. AUTOMATE
settled inside and was slowly getting to the winner late. BELLARMINE HALL wasn't far back early between horses, swung wide into the stretch then tired.
BUILT THAT WAY was slow early, stayed inside and passed tired ones. BRAVE DEACON was outrun. WAHOOWA WAHOOWA stayed outside and failed
to matter. MIDNIGHT WHISKEY made the early pace outside the winner and was finished after six furlongs.
