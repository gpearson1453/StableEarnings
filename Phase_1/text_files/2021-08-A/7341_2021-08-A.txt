the drive. MEET MICHELLE lacked speed, swung four deep approaching the stretch and rallied outside horses. ADABEL saved ground around the turn,
remained along the rail in the stretch and flattened out. SUNDAY IN L B C disputed the pace outside the winner and tired. MY WAY OR ELSE , along the
inner rail throughout, was no factor. SLIP SLIDIN , three wide around the turn, failed to rally.

Footnotes
RUNUP broke on top despite stumbling, recovered and went clear, set the pace removed from the rail and under some coaxing, responded when set down
three wide in upper stretch, opened up under left handed rousing past mid stretch then was steadily hand ridden through the final sixteenth. VODKATINI
saved ground chasing the pace, stayed inside for the drive and kept on grinding to get up for the place. I'M GITTIN THERE bore in at the break,
straightened and edged up to the inside of a rival, stalked inside around the turn, eased out for the drive, gave hard chase past mid stretch and continued
willingly. CALIFORNIA BELLA drifted out at the break, chased to the outside of a rival, shifted four wide in upper stretch but came up empty.
PREPAREFORTAKEOFF broke slowly, advanced three wide nearing the half mile marker, circled four to five wide into the stretch, had her rider lose the
whip in upper stretch, sustained progress past the eighth pole then hung late outside rivals. AT THE GATE hopped at the break, steadied off the heels of I'M
GITTIN THERE when that one bore in, lagged back around the turn then dropped further back through the drive.

Footnotes
BACKSTREET GAL settled off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn, angled four wide into the lane, shifted further out when gathering some
momentum in mid stretch, leveled off when put to stronger handling and surged past rivals to win going away. FROSTERIA leaned in at the break, corrected
and pulled her way forward, steadied leaving the five eighths then was sent through between rivals to entertain the pace, vied outside MATTITUDE around
the turn, continued that battle past mid stretch, gained a short lead while drifting in some in deep stretch then failed to last. BELLE OF THE NORTH broke
slowly, raced well back leaving the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved up past mid stretch, stayed on her left lead, loomed past the sixteenth
pole but was out finished. MATTITUDE , a bit fractious in the post parade, quickly went clear and secured the inside, was joined heading to the half mile
marker, handled outside pressure around the turn, dueled on a slim lead leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly through the final thirty yards.
BRANDYURAFINEGIRL had speed and vied three deep nearing the turn, chased around the turn but came up empty through the final furlong'. TASFEEQ
broke slowly, moved up some past the five eighths, dropped in around the turn and gave way.

HUSHED HIJINKS saved ground on the turn stalking the duel, eased outside in upper stretch, switched leads three times in the stretch run, led near the
sixteenths pole and drove clear. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT dueled outside THE BIG K around the turn, gained a clear lead approaching the eighth pole and
weakened late. SMITTEN ENOUGH drifted to the four path in upper stretch, drifted to the inner rail near the eighth pole and lacked the necessary rally. THE
BIG K saved ground around the turn while disputing the pace, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and weakened. PEPE AND HEYWOOD trailed after breaking
slowly.

Footnotes
PITCHING ARI rated off the pace about three wide, edged up past the five eighths then bid three deep with a half mile to go, dueled outside rivals to the five
sixteenths, spurted clear under pressure entering the lane, switched over to his left lead near the sixteenth pole then was fully extended to prevail.
SOLOMONIC tracked the pace, moved up under some asking then bid between foes near the half mile pole, battled past the five sixteenths, chased
towards the rail nearing mid stretch, altered out and came back gamely to gain. DIAMOND SETTER saved ground off the early pace, made a bit of a run
nearing the half mile marker, was under heavy pressure pursuing the leading trio leaving the three eighths, churned on some in the final furlong but failed to
pose a serious threat. HAYNE'S FEVER drafted back off the pace while saving ground, angled very wide in upper stretch but failed to menace. GREEK
PRINCE settled off the early pace, lost ground four wide past the three quarter pole, moved up some heading towards the far turn, chased but came up
empty through the final quarter mile. TALENTED DR. B was sent clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined by a pair of rivals near the half mile
pole, battled to the five sixteenths, shifted four wide in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TAPPIN CAT cleared early, controlled the pace while towards the inside, came under some urging near the five sixteenths and opened up a bit, turned away
a threat from AIR TOKEN near the eighth pole while under left handed urging then pulled away while hand ridden late. AIR TOKEN drifted in at the break,
corrected and settled three wide, edged up mid way through the backstretch run, gave hard chase into the lane, had aim with a furlong to go, flattened out
some but managed to hold down the place. THUNDERSHOOK prompted the pace two wide, was under asking leaving the far turn, gave futile chase past
the five sixteenths, shifted out in upper stretch but came up empty. TYBALT saved ground while not far back, was under urging leaving the far turn, angled
out in the drive but failed to generate a serious response.

FOOL YOURSELF lacked speed, hugged the inner rail leaving the far turn and in upper stretch, swung to the four path near the eighth pole, closed
determinedly outside horses and was up late. BECKON showed speed along the inner rail, was prompted by A GIRL NAMED JAC down the backstretch
and around the far turn, opened a clear lead near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. A GIRL NAMED JAC bore out start, prompted the pace outside
BECKON down the backstretch and around the far turn then faded late. WHO U GONNA CALL , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the
far turn three deep, was fanned six wide in upper stretch and rallied. MAUREENLOVESFRANK , forced out by A GIRL NAMED JAC leaving the starting
gate, stalked the pace inside horses and weakened late. DANGER ZONE , four wide the far turn, gave way. CHAMPAGNE TOAST , three wide the first
turn, stalked the pace for five furlongs, gave way in the stretch and was eased.
