Footnotes
WOKE UP IN LOVE settled well, moved closer on the turn, responded gamely in the stretch and was up in the last jump. TIME GOES ON stalked the early
pace, took over on the turn, was driven clear in the stretch and reeled in. KNIGHT COMMANDER led early, was headed on turn and stayed on in the
stretch. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE never menaced. DISCREET INVASION was crowded at the start and did not factor. TAKE ME UP BRADY chased along
the inside and came up empty. MR. SOLO raced in striking position while three wide and faded.
