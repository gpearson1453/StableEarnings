Footnotes
HIGH GLORY bumped with KENYA SUN at the start, sprinted to the early lead inside, shook clear midway on the turn, and widened steadily in hand.
SCIENCE advanced around the turn while moving out five wide, finished willingly and was clearly second best. G T'S BLUE SQUALL tracked three wide to
the turn, moved in for the drive and finished one-paced on the rail. MISS YAYA stayed in range four wide early, but lacked a closing response. KENYA SUN
bumped with HIGH GLORY at the break, was off slowly as a result and reacted greenly, got steered to the far outside soon after that, remained out in the
six-path on the turn and ran on without entering contention. BELLA SOFI pressed the winner from between horses for nearly a half-mile, and faded steadily.
FUTURE PRINCESS saved ground and never factored. TRINNI BEAUTY hustled up early along the rail, but was finished after a half. FOR EVER OURS
broke a step slow, circled five wide near the quarter-pole, and had nothing left into the lane. LORETTAS COMITMENT was outrun early, and dropped far
back before reaching the stretch.

Footnotes
NIGHT JUMPER bumped with PANADERO early, steadied into the first turn, saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole,
responded immediately, surged to the front, took over turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane and powered clear under intermittent
left-handed urging. SQUEEZE ME MIKE raced off the early pace three wide between foes, angled in down the backstretch, saved ground around most of
the far turn, swung four wide near the quarter pole, was bumped in upper stretch then finished well outside. BEASTFROMTHEEAST was in range two wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally. ERLAN stumbled at the start, raced four wide throughout and stayed on willingly.
PHARAOH'S PROPHECY bumped with HE'SSOSUBTLE twice early, set the pace along the rail to the quarter pole and weakened through the lane.
DRINKSONTHEBEACH prompted the pace two wide, briefly led near the quarter pole and tired in the drive. POETIC CODE chased the pace three wide,
bumped with ERLAN in upper stretch and faded. PANADERO was bumped and pinched back nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two wide and never
threatened. HE'SSOSUBTLE was bumped twice early, saved ground and made little impact. DANLEY hit the starting gate to get away last and trailed in the
three path.

Footnotes
BEYOND HEAVENLY pursued DINNER AT FIVE from outside, came under a ride approaching the quarter-pole, edged closer leaving the furlong grounds,
reached the front a sixteenth out and prevailed while exchanging brushes late. DINNER AT FIVE set the pace toward the inside, dug in when confronted by
BEYOND HEAVENLY into the last eighth of a mile, and yielded stubbornly while exchanging brushes near the finish. MARIALUISA was outsprinted through
the opening half-mile, and rallied mildly in the two-path to get up for the show. BIONIC BOTTLE gave chase two wide to the turn, moved in approaching the
stretch and lacked a final response on the rail. BLESSED BEAST shied in from LAILONI at the break and was off slowly, raced three to four wide and
proved no factor. LAILONI veered in sharply at the start, and was outpaced through the turn while gradually shifting out four wide. VARSOVIA broke in the
air spotting the field several lengths, and was always far back.

Footnotes
FLYING BLACK stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the eighth pole, switched to the right lead leaving that pole, kicked clear and held clear.
PANOTTI settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole and rallied for the place. PROMISE ME set the pace along the rail to
midstretch, yielded and stayed on for the show. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY raced two and three wide and never threatened. FASTLIFE broke a bit
awkwardly, saved ground well back, went four wide around the far turn and made little impact. MARIMBA broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace two and
three wide and came up empty in the lane. CHECK TWICE broke slowly, raced three wide early, angled in nearing the far turn and played no factor.
PRETTY PRINCESS stalked the pace two and three wide and retreated nearing the lane. SPARKLING PLENTY chased the pace three wide and was
through after a half.

Footnotes
MADAME CLAUDE worked her way to the rail up the backstretch, took over inside MISS INEZ just before completing a quarter-mile, shook off pressure
turning for home, and jumped back to her left lead a sixteenth out with matters well in hand. DOMINANT JOY was never far back, came five wide off the turn
and finished willingly. BIG SURPRISE pressed the pace three wide, got shaken off into the stretch, and weakened while able to stay well clear of the
remainder. SHES A GIFT alternated between the rail and two-path around the turn, and lacked a rally. FOLK HERO lagged well back for three furlongs,
came four wide into the lane and went by tired horses. VANISHING FAITH hit the right side of the gate at the start, advanced outside early, made continued
progress four wide on the turn to loom a threat, but gave way into the lane. OUR ELECTRA GUITAR broke slowly, and failed to factor three to four wide.
LOOK UP TO HEAVEN was finished early inside. MISS INEZ led through most of the opening quarter before getting headed by MADAME CLAUDE, vied
between that one and BIG SURPRISE into the turn, and gave way after three furlongs. KATIES A LADY was never in the hunt. BELLA ROMANCE broke
slowest and was a distant trailer.

Footnotes
TREASURE RUN stalked the pace two wide, seized command near the eighth pole, drew clear soon after and held safe EXPRESS PHAROAH'S late
charge. EXPRESS PHAROAH tracked the pace three wide and finished willingly to narrow much of the gap. HALCYON DIGEST set a clear pace inside,
yielded near the eighth pole and stayed on well enough to hold the show. MAJORITY RULES went evenly inside. SULEMAN was knocked off stride soon
after the start, raced far back two wide early, raced four wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly outside. EL SOLITARIO bumped with NAVAJO
CREED at the start, raced two wide in midpack and never threatened. BAD BOY E. J. was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground well back,
swung out in upper stretch and ran on outside. NAVAJO CREED was bumped at the start, raced three wide around the first turn, saved ground rounding the
far turn and made little impact. MONY broke out and bumped foes at the start, steadied along inside for the first three furlongs, advanced four wide around
the far turn but failed to sustain that bid. JOE BENJAMIN hopped at the start and played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
SPROUT WINGS pressed the early pace between horses, took over at the top of the stretch, drifted out late and had enough to hold on. DROP A HINT
raced three wide between horses early, moved out widest for the drive and was getting to the winner in the closing strides. PANAREA was a step slow to
begin, saved ground for a half-mile, moved out in the stretch and rallied between horses. LORILOUPIES set the pace near the inside for a half, got collared
by the winner turning for home, and gave way. AWESOME ANNMARIE was a step slow at the start, raced four wide and could not reach contention.
PALOMITA pressed the pace outside, and tired four wide approaching the stretch. BARGAINAIRE was a step slow at the break and retired early.

THENORTHREMEMBERS prompted the pace two wide, took a short leaving the quarter pole, drifted into the three path in upper stretch, came back into the
two path leaving the eighth pole, cleared off from the embattled foes inside and just withstood STUNNING BABY'S late surge. STUNNING BABY saved
ground in midpack, swung out in upper stretch, bumped FREELANCE leaving the three-sixteenths pole, kicked in outside and just missed. BUENISIMO
stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch, tried to split rivals nearing the eighth pole, steadied and angled in as
THENORTHREMEBERS came in a bit leaving that marker, tipped back out soon after and finished with good courage between foes. MONTANA MAN
tracked the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane. METEORITO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. POLITICAL RIOT played
no factor while racing two wide. FREELANCE was in range while racing two and three wide, was bumped in upper stretch and finished evenly.
TELLINGTON saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn failed to menace. GUNMAN set the pace inside to midstretch, was shut off
leaving the eighth pole, and eased from there. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF BUESNISIMO,
THENORTHREMEMBERS WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

Footnotes
GLORY OF FLORIDA was covered up in and among horses for six furlongs or so, came through inside SQUEEZADIOS to take a short lead in midstretch,
edged away while switching back to his left lead 70 yards out and held firm to the finish. COOL ARROW was close up throughout in a tightly-knit group,
came five wide off the turn and ran on willingly to get up for the place. SQUEEZADIOS vied up front from the start, edged away briefly getting clear after six
furlongs, stayed on to the furlong grounds and was caught from both sides. GARTER AND TIE saved ground in range to the turn, shifted to the two-path
turning for home, went back to the rail past the eighth-pole and finished evenly. QUENANE was close up early, lost position widest through the backstretch
run, attempted to rally around the turn still on the far outside, and faded through the final stages. SCAR stayed close to the turn, fanned six wide at the top of
the stretch, and came up empty. MO HAWK set a pressured pace inside for a half-mile, relinquished command to SQUEEZADIOS around the turn, and
retreated.

Footnotes
ALASTOR was in range inside, angled three wide nearing the quarter pole, reached near even terms in upper stretch, dueled outside of GUACO through
much of the lane and drove clear in deep stretch. GUACO stalked the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, was immediately confronted by the
winner, battled on inside of that foe to deep stretch and settled for second best late. FITZ'S MO set the pace along the rail for six furlongs, could not keep
pace with the top two in the lane but held well enough to preserve the show. POWER (BRZ) chased the pace two and three wide, angled out in the lane and
lacked the needed rally. EXCALIBUR broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally.
PROSPECT PROJECT failed to menace while racing five wide. TONS OF GOLD played no factor while racing two wide. MULSANNE RUN was outrun
inside. HERE COMES BULLET made little impact while racing three wide.
