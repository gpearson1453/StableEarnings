Footnotes
BARONE CESCO showed very good speed from the start then quickly sped clear, dictated terms in the two path through the turn, responded well when set
down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, remained clear into the final sixteenth and was fully extended to last
under strong urging. EMMA'S WALTZ was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, raced in the back half of the field under reserve, saved ground
early on the turn, was let out and asked at the five-sixteenths then shifted three wide, came five wide into upper stretch, drifted out outside the eighth-pole
then was straightened by the rider, rallied outside in the final furlong, drifted in while gaining fast late and just missed but earned the place. KING OF
HOLLYWOOD was well placed just off the pace on the inside while inside of two foes, came under coaxing along the rail on the turn, was driven three wide
into upper stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and finished willingly for the show. NOT YET CHARLIE
was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back while
remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong, continued on his inside lead to the wire and lacked the needed kick. SAILOR SPEED hesitated at the start
and broke a bit slow then bumped lightly with an opponent, moved out then was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, moved out under a
drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SMOKEY WHITE broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside, was roused three wide early on the
turn, moved to the four path late on that bend, came out a bit further into upper stretch and failed to rally. ARTIE'S ANGEL was bumped at the start then
forced into another foe and checked while squeezed back, raced under strong urging at the rear, saved ground on on the turn and was no factor. NO MI
CULPA broke out and bumped lightly with a foe then was quickly corrected by the rider, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the
two path, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and capitulated.

ROAMING UNION hustled from the gate, crossed to the two path into the first turn and dueled with MALIBU PRO to his outside trading command down the
backstretch, remained just off the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing in tandem with his main pace rival at the five-sixteenths, floated three to
four wide into upper stretch, shook off his main danger nearing the eighth pole and edged clear under a drive to prevail. TAPALIST coaxed from the gate,
raced three wide through the first turn, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home while safe for the place honors. MALIBU PRO
coaxed from the start, raced three wide forwardly placed through the first turn, dueled three then two wide with ROAMING UNION to his inside coming
under coaxing in concert at the five-sixteenths, got floated out five wide for home, dug in latched on until nearing the eighth pole when shaken off and

Footnotes
COASTANA settled at the rear while traveling in the two to three path, was roused on the final turn, angled five wide late on that bend, rallied outside into
upper stretch, closed fast to get the lead outside the furlong marker, shook clear into the final sixteenth and proved best under a hand ride late. SETTING
THE MOOD went three wide under stout restraint on the opening bend, tucked into the two path entering the stretch for the first time, was reserved while
inside to the two path from that point, came under urging with five-sixteenths to run then shifted three wide, swung five wide into the stretch then moved out
a path further while gaining, pursued the winner in the final furlong and safely secured the place. SINGLE SOUL (GB) was taken in hand while going to the
front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way under a hold, lugged out while two then three wide on the final turn then
continued out four wide into the stretch, was asked for her best under heavy threat around the three-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
furlong marker and weakened but held the show then was vanned off after the race. LONGPANTS REQUIRED was eased back off the early pace then
switched from the rail to the two path on the initial turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked with three furlongs to run, chased while carried out three
then four wide on the final turn, dropped back to the three path into the stretch and weakened. CREATIVE CAIRO was caught four wide while under stout
restraint on the first turn, raced off the pace under a vigorous hold while traveling two to three wide, came under urging while let out on the final turn and
failed to respond. LAYNLOMAKNDOUGH was last to commence, saved ground while rated under a snug hold, was asked on the final turn and came up
empty.

Footnotes
JALEN JOURNEY hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command set down spinning
three wide into upper stretch and went clear under a drive to prevail. ROCK ON LUKE veered in at the start forcing WICKED TRICK to steady off his heels
and ANSWER IN to be taken briefly in hand when bumped between foes, came under coaxing and continued to cross to the inside to show the way in hand
through swift splits, came under challenge nearing the quarter pole and was displaced from the front spinning just off the inside for home, dug in under a
drive no match for the top one while just holding for the place honors over a pair. ENDORSED coaxed from the start, chased along the inside under a ride
from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly for the show honors loosely between rivals through the final
sixteenth. PULSATE broke out a step at the start bumping ANSWER IN in concert with WICKED TRICK, chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to miss for the place and show honors. ANSWER IN got bumped between foes at the start
and was briefly taken in hand as ROCK ON LUKE veered in front conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased two to three wide
under encouragement from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and tired. WICKED TRICK shied in slightly bumping with ANSWER IN and was
steadied off the heels of ROCK ON LUKE at the start conceding three lengths to the front before able to settle into stride under coaxing, chased three to four
wide under a motivation from the five-sixteenths, went six wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
AIRBORNE GAL came away in good order, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action while inside on the turn, responded well when set
down into upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop while drifting out outside the furlong marker, drifted out a bit again near the sixteenth-pole and held
under strong urging. COMMANDANDCONTROL settled comfortably off the pace, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, moved
to the two path outside the quarter-pole, came out in pursuit of the winner into upper stretch, chased that foe in the drive and finished willingly for the place
while unable to overhaul the winner. HOT ANNA acted-up badly just as the gate opened and was off several lengths slow, dropped well behind the rest of
the field, was urged along in the two path on the turn, made a big run from the three-eighths into upper stretch but flattened out and settled for the show.
SCHOOL OF THOUGHT settled towards the rear, saved ground under urging on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally.
VIOLENT VIXEN drifted out some leaving the chute, tracked the pace on the outside, rounded the early portion of the turn in the two path, was asked at the
five-sixteenths then moved to the three path, chased into the stretch and came up empty. SUPERBLOODWOLFMOON settled on the outside, was asked
with a half-mile to run, went three then four wide on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. EMPTY NET was rated just off the
pace on the outside, went three wide early on the turn, was asked just inside the five-sixteenths then moved to four wide, chased into the stretch and
capitulated.

FORTY UNDER established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled and facing little pressure save through the presence of
BEACON HILL to the outside attending the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat
from the runner up and gamely held well to the finish rebuffing the challenge to prevail on the wire. MO READY coaxed from the gate, tracked the pace
along the inside from the pocket, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch tipping out from in behind the
aforementioned foe roused into daylight, rallied to latch on a furlong from home looming boldly to the outside through to the finish but was repelled to the
line. VALUE ENGINEERING broke in at the start coming over to the rail and forcing CONVICTION TRADE to steady off his heels, settled two to three wide
in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, paused briefly in tight between foes before continuing two to three wide into upper stretch, angled to
the inside safely in front of GUNNISON near the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick to secure the show honors in the late stages. BEACON HILL
forwardly placed three then two wide through the first turn, attended the leader to the outside under a rating grip three then two wide patiently handled until
placed to urging inside the five-sixteenths marker, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming in slightly to bump with WINNING
FACTOR a furlong from home, ran on in a blanket finish to procure the last major share. WINNING FACTOR just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack,
tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and steadily advanced on the rail moving into contention when set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive prominent nearing the eighth pole when coming out very slightly to trade a bump with BEACON HILL, then got outfinished in the late
stages. CONVICTION TRADE shied in at the break in reaction to VALUE ENGINEERING breaking inwards, then got steadied off that rival's heels just after
the start conceding three lengths of ground while at the tail of the field, went two to three wide through the first turn and down the backstretch before tipping
four then five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch as the field stacked out straightened
away for home and made no headway to the finish while offering a mild bid. CITY MAN got bumped at the start by CALIBRATOR, who broke inwards and

three to four wide through the first turn, raced four paths off the inside down the backstretch in the clear, came under coaxing four to five wide at the
five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and had no kick for the drive. GUNNISON just off the inside near the rear of the field, tucked inside at the
seven-sixteenths, came under a ride with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. CAVALRY CHARGE

far turn under motivation from the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, was in the midst of backing away when forced to check a furlong out
as NO WORD and CAVALRY CHARGE maneuvered to the two seams in front, then continued to weaken to the finish. SMILE BRYAN went three wide

ART COLLECTOR hustled from the gate, established the front shortly after the start and showed the way just off the inside through the first turn before
taking to the inside down the backstretch settling into a comfortable rhythm in hand, got attended early on to the outside by NIGHT OPS, had that rival
intensify the pressure under ever increasing coaxing from the half mile pole through the far turn and was given a notch to remain safely in front while
pressed through that bend widening away as a pair from the rest of the field, took the inside route into upper stretch remaining patiently handled as NIGHT
OPS backed away under scrubbing and edged away to the eighth pole, had that rival begin to close in to threaten once more nearing the sixteenth marker
and was roused to a drive being shown the crop to the off side to the finish to hold well and safe to the wire. NIGHT OPS forwardly placed three wide
through the first turn, attended the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path down the backstretch before coming under coaxing to press the
issue half a mile from home, applied pressure through the far turn to ART COLLECTOR to the outside urged along while shaking away as a tandem from
the rest of the field, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive growing briefly erratic when shaken off nearing the eighth pole, continued
to be scrubbed along and came again closing once more on the top one willingly near the sixteenth marker, then got held safe to the finish while well clear
of the rest for the place honors. MATH WIZARD bobbled at the break, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut
the corner into upper stretch and improved position for the show honors. CORE BELIEFS coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside from just off the
pace coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. LIMONITE coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide
under a ride from three furlongs out, angled four wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. PRIORITIZE coaxed at the start, chased along the
inside coming under encouragement at the three-eighths, cornered three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BOURBON WAR bobbled at the
break, chased three to four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. JESUS' TEAM turned his head to the left side
just as the latch was sprung and leapt up at the start conceding six to seven lengths to the front, tipped out from off the rail to the be two then three wide
through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under a ride from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into

Footnotes
FAST BOAT was grabbed with the left-rein at the start, settled off the pace, moved from the inside to the three path while roused on the turn, swung five
wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed crop, closed strongly to get the lead nearing the sixteenth-pole then switched to a left-handed
crop, swapped back to his inside lead shortly thereafter and prevailed under strong urging. CAROTARI broke in then bumped lightly with a rival, was hustled
to the lead then set the pace under urging with pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper
stretch, lost the advantage to the winner coming to the sixteenth-pole, fought on well to the wire and missed in a good effort while able to get the place.
GEAR JOCKEY was off a couple of lengths behind the front, settled on the outside towards the rear, moved in to save ground on the turn, swung six wide
into upper stretch and finished with good energy for the show. IMPRIMIS bumped lightly with an opponent at the start, settled nicely off the pace, was asked
while two to three wide on the turn, came out some while pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. BOUND
FOR NOWHERE settled on the outside, was roused while two to three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch, steadied nearing the furlong
marker and lacked the needed response. FRONT RUN THE FED broke a step slow, settled while last but one, was roused in the two path on the turn,
moved out inside the three-sixteenths and gained ground but failed to threaten. LAZULI (IRE) broke a half-step slow, tugged hard at the bit under tight
restraint while pressing the pace on the outside, vied in the two path while let on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. CHEWING GUM broke a
step slow, settled at the back, went three wide on the turn, came four to five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. CLASSY JOHN was eased back
off the pace then well placed down the backstretch, saved ground while given his cue on the turn and came up empty.

five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. REINER coaxed at the start, showed the way in hand along the inside
