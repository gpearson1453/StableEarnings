Footnotes
MONEY COMETH pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch, took the advantage and held on well for the win. SOUTHERN
LIGHT unhurried in the early going, moved up on the inside around the turn, angled out down the stretch, rallied, four wide and was getting to the winner.
DOOLIN vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished by the top two. TROPHY DADDY broke in, challenged for the lead and
lacked a late kick. NO EXAGGERATION raced within contention, came around the turn four wide, weakened and finished evenly. PRE HEAT checked early,
getting in tight quarters, raced in the back and was never a threat. BANQUET CHEF lacked early speed and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #2 PRE HEAT
LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #3 TROPHY DADDY FOR INTERFERENCE AT THE START OF THE RACE. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #3 FROM FOURTH AND PLACED HIM SIXTH.

RUNAWAY HENNY unhurried in the early part, moved up three wide around the second turn, rallied, five wide down the stretch and proved the best.
FLURRY OF FEATHERS lacked early speed, made a late bid, racing six wide, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. MALIBU MIDNIGHT
sprinted to the front, drove clear, lacked a late kick and was caught at the wire for second. TEXAS SPRING raced within contention, saved ground around
the second turn and faded. PRINCESA ANN pressed the pace in the beginning, weakened and finished evenly. MASKED MANDATE void of early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. VERITY JANE was an early factor and dropped back. BACKGATE BELLE raced in the middle of the field, dropped
back and was no threat late. I DONT KNOW EITHER lacked early speed and was never close. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
