CHECK AND RAISE was unhurried early, advanced around the far turn, bid five wide to challenge, dueled through the stretch and inched away late to prove
best. NO SUPAH FOR YOU pressed the pace while racing along the inside, assumed command on the backstretch, drew clear on the turn, responded
when challenged to duel, went willingly to the wire and was outfinished in a good effort. HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY raced close to the pace, bid willingly to
loom a threat, hung late and settled for show. CATS TOUCH was unhurried early and raced in the back, put in a steady effort and improved position.
CHIEFTAIN'S LAD was off a step slowly, moved up to stalk the pace, tired on the turn and gave way. OUT FOR JUSTICE led early, raced in contention to
the second turn, stopped and was not urged through the stretch. Hand timed.

CHEROKEE PAPOOSE raced close to the pace, fell back on the turn, shifted out, closed willingly and wore down J T'S LA NENA to get up at the wire. J T'S
LA NENA set the pace, drew off on the turn for a clear lead and was caught at the wire. SILLY NOTION broke slowly, saved ground while racing mid pack,
put in a steady effort and earned show. POLAR ROUTE showed speed to the turn and gave way. GLITTER GULCH raced in the back, went widest in the
drive and lacked a bid. MERRY MARIE trailed the field. Hand timed.

HEATSEEKER BABY broke awkwardly, moved up inside to set the pace and held well in a driving finish. TWITTERATI pressed the pace, lacked the
needed late response and finished second best. MY FUNNY GAL pressed the pace while racing between horses, was checked along the backstretch,
dropped inside, bid and hung. PERKY BRUNETTE was crowded early, raced in the back and improved position in a steady effort. MY EXPRESSION raced
in close towards the outside, dropped back on the turn and faded. MERITTRIS was outrun in an even effort. ARIES pressed the pace, weakened in the drive
and faded. BLUEGRASS BETTY was not a factor. FOXY CARMELA was outrun. Hand timed.
