Footnotes
KING'S HOUSE tracked close up on the inside, came through on the rail to challenge on the turn, took over, drew clear in the stretch and held well under
urging. HARPER steadied at the start, raced off the pace, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside and was along for the place spot.
RATTLESNAKE RIDGE raced off the pace with a ground saving trip, rallied on the rail passing the quarter pole and closed mildly inside in the stretch run.
JUMP SHOT stalked close up three wide, bid three wide on the turn and weakened in the lane. STRAWBERRY RED set the pace, dueled two wide on the
turn and faded. PER THE DELAWERE RACING COMMISSION, STRAWBERRY RED HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A POSTIVIVE TEST.
