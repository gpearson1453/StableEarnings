THE MALLARD QUEEN trailed the field, saved ground to the turn, angled out, swung wide entering the stretch, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to
get up in the final strides. SPEEDY GIGI set the pace, raced in hand to the turn, led to the final strides and was outfinished in a good effort. SARAH'S STAR
was never far off the pace, closed steadily and was gaining late. FAITH IN EXCESS stalked the pace, swung wide entering the stretch and closed well once
straightened. FICETY LADY raced close to the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail to loom a threat and came up empty late. Hand timed.

Footnotes
SOUTH FRESNO saved ground while racing mid pack, bid along the inside, dueled for the lead late and prevailed in a game effort. MOONLITE GRAHAM
sprinted clear to set the pace, dueled late and was outnodded to just miss. YHA YHA hesitated at the start, was void of early speed and trailed the field, bid
off the rail and finished well to earn show. CAPTAIN RED was never far back, closed steadily and didn't have enough late. ANYONE SEEN LOGAN went
widest in the drive and lacked the needed late response. PAITASKA showed speed to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. Hand timed.

narrowed the gap and didn't have enough late. TROPHY CHEST advanced to the turn, bid off the rail, loomed a threat, hung late and settled for show. OUT
OF SPEIGHT bumped at the start, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked the needed late response. INDIAN HARBOR broke slowly, raced very wide early
and passed tiring rivals. LOTSA LENA bumped at the start, raced close to the pace outside and stopped on the turn. TAHOE BLUE moved up inside to vie

three across, fell back on the turn, continued willingly to the wire and was gaining late. BOB'S ALL IN was never far off the pace, closed mid track, had the
rider lose the whip mid stretch and got up for show. A NEW TREND vied two wide, fell back leaving the turn and was unable to sustain his bid. QUETTA'S

CAPITAL REEF stalked the pace, assumed command entering the stretch and drew clear. AGUA DORADO was reluctant to load, was never far off the
pace while racing inside, lacked the needed late rally and finished second best. BULLET TIMES raced mid pack, closed steadily and earned show while no
threat to the top two. LUCKY ROCKET set the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. ROUSING RUBBLE held a good position, lacked
a stretch response and dropped back. SMILING MATT lost his footing at the start, veered in and was checked, raced in the back in an even effort and was
not a threat. UNCONSCIOUS POWER broke slowly, went widest in the drive and showed little. Hand timed.
