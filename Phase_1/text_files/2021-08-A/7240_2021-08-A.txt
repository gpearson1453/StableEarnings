Footnotes
FAMILY FORTUNE showed speed outside LAMBEAU LADY, steadied on the heels of GOLDEN LASSIE leaving the backstretch, advanced to gain the lead
approaching the eighth pole and drove clear. CONGRESS HALL , four deep on the turn, rallied outside horses. LAMBEAU LADY rushed up early, showed
speed along the rail and gave way the final furlong. HELLO GRACIE , well placed three wide on the turn, failed to rally. UTTERLY ENCHANTING raced in
the two path on the turn, was inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. CREATIVE ALIBI hugged the inner rail and was not a factor. GOLDEN LASSIE
unseated her rider when she reared at the break then showed speed and drifted in front of FAMILY FORTUNE leaving the backstretch. There was a
stewards' inquiry concerning the break but no action was taken.

Footnotes
FIRE IN THE HOLE , brushed at the break, settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide into the lane, shifted
out a bit wider and leveled off under left handed asking, forged past the dueling leaders in deep stretch and drew out. POUNDING MUSIC rated three wide
just off a contested pace, pulled her way forward to join the pace fray past the five eighths, dueled outside SELF ASSURED from the far turn, gained a slim
lead in mid stretch, kept on past the sixteenth marker and stayed well to save the place. SELF ASSURED set a pressured pace inside, dug in when
confronted by POUNDING MUSIC into the far turn, sparred with that one to deep stretch and continued with interest to the wire. BROADWAY MELODY
dropped in early, moved up in hand while saving ground past the half mile marker, eased out under asking and pursued the embattled leaders into the lane,
gave willing chase to the sixteenth marker, switched to her left lead late and flattened out. INCONTROVERTIBLE , brushed with the winner at the start, was
taken in hand to race about three wide and off the pace, gained some steam into the lane, edged up past the three sixteenths, altered out late and kept on
with interest. POLISH COOKIE saved ground while unhurried, eased out advancing past mid stretch and steadily gained. MAGICAL CHARM lagged inside
and failed to respond. TUNNEL STRIKE , off the pace, raced four wide leaving the far turn and failed to menace. BELLA COOLA , brushed at the start,
disputed the pace outside SELF ASSURED, failed to kick on leaving the far turn and faltered.

B B BAD prompted the pace three wide outside rivals, moved closer nearing the lane, bid four wide outside the leader soon into the lane, secured command
with a furlong remaining and pulled away under a steady hand ride. SHAKE EM LOOSE , off slowly when bumped around at the break, dropped well off the
early pace, angled four wide into the lane and leveled off to a good stride through the final furlong. DONTCROSSFUZZY sped to command inside foes soon
after the break, set a rated pace towards the rail, held a clear lead past the five sixteenths, drifted three wide and was collared soon into the stretch, fought
on past the furlong grounds then gave way very late. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY dropped in early, chased the leaders around the turn, remained inside through
the drive but lacked a solid finish. PRINCE OF PORTLAND , sluggish from the gate, lagged off the pace, raced three wide into the lane and failed to
respond. CASH FLOWING forced the pace between rivals, pressed two wide mid turn, failed to keep up in upper stretch then gave way. TWO TODAY
saved ground and faltered.

FAIR CATCH , bumped by SO DIALED IN leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, opened up in mid stretch and was
kept under pressure in the drive. TAUBER lacked speed, swung to the four path in upper stretch and offered a late rally outside rivals.
JUSTWAVEANDSMILE prompted the pace outside the winner and weakened late. DRAGON MOON hugged the inner rail around the turn and weakened.
SO DIALED IN , steadied when bearing in at the break, checked in tight quarters between horses entering the turn then failed to rally. TALE OF DIXIE , no
factor, swung four deep entering the stretch. MORE THUNDER , three deep on the turn chasing the pace, weakened.

Footnotes
CHARLIE POTATOES , between rivals near the half mile marker, eased out a bit around the turn and commenced a run, circled four wide advancing into
the lane, forged clear under a drive in mid stretch then steadily widened while kept to task. PET'S NIGHT , in the clear chasing past the half mile marker,
edged up three wide and to the inside of the winner entering the lane, failed to match strides with that one but continued on willingly to gain the place.
BALTIMORE BUD , away alertly, vied outside a rival through the opening quarter mile, kicked away leaving the far turn, was put to urging past the five
sixteenths, failed to contain the winner leaving the three sixteenths then weakened late. DOC ELM , sluggish from the gate, edged up a bit while five wide
leaving the half mile marker, chased four wide around the turn but failed to generate a legitimate stretch response. CANHERUN broke slowly, was ridden
along leaving the half mile marker, split rivals mid turn, continued with some progress to mid stretch then flattened out. WE'RE FROM BRISTOL , unruly
behind the gate and difficult to load, had speed to the inside of BALTIMORE BUD, kept that one occupied to the far turn, gave chase from the three eighths
to upper stretch then faded. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE , away slowly, lagged well back, saved ground past the three sixteenths and failed to menace. DIRTY
DIRTY gave brief chase inside and retreated. BEAN POLE gave early pursuit three wide and dropped back.

LIKELY CHOICE lacked speed well off the rail, swung to the four path in upper stretch, closed outside, led late and drew off. LOOKS DON'T LIE , bumped
leaving the starting gate, swung wide in upper stretch and rallied while on her left lead. DEW DAT quickly sprinted clear, set the pace slightly off the rail and
gave way late. BULLETS LADY , reluctant to load into the starting gate, chased the pace, raced between horses in the stretch and weakened. GUAPA
CHICA , five deep on the turn, drifted out entering the stretch. LADY PERRY bumped with ZOLA B in a jam up leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner
rail and was no factor. DIGGIN FOR DOUGH bore in on foes leaving the starting gate, chased the pace and gave way. SQUARE PENNY , three wide
between horses on the turn, was not a factor. ZOLA B , soundly bumped at the break, was outrun. KYOSHA briefly chased the pace, raced four wide on the
turn and weakened. VERYAN was not a factor. SALAD DAYS trailed.

BAND ON TOUR edged up in hand two wide and prompted CRY NO MORE, dogged that one around the turn, battled on near even terms from the head of
the lane, secured command inside the sixteenth marker, remained on his left lead then kicked clear after an extended drive. CRY NO MORE quickly went
clear then dropped in towards the rail, was joined heading to the half mile marker, staved off the winner to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly.
TOMMY SHELBY , three deep chasing the top pair, closed steadily and earned the show. THE POSER pulled his way forward and attempted to get off the
rail past the five eighths, was kept in and saved ground into the turn, chased inside rivals into the stretch and finished with interest. BAPTIZE THE BOY ,
caught between rivals most of the way, failed to muster up a strong response.
