Footnotes
Z U AT THE RACES settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the five sixteenths pole, gained ground
between horses in upper stretch and drew off in the final furlong. YALIKEANYTHING chased the leader up the backstretch, began a bid from the rail nearing
the three eighths pole, switched outside entering the stretch, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked from there, the best of the rest.
MORETHANSOULTITLE dropped back to trail the field through the opening quarter of a mile, improved position mildly while racing in the two and three path
around the turn and was no match for the top two. CHOPPER opened up a clear early lead for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
gave way entering the stretch and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
AUDREY'S TIME settled at the rear, continued between horses in the rear flight into the turn, began to improve between horses in the three path past the
three eighths, came two wide into the lane, advanced four wide through the final furlong and got up just in time. DOCS SEVEN was placed on the lead, set
the pace in the two path on the turn, kept on from near the three eighths when MARY OF BETHANY began to loom outside of her, drove clear into the
stretch, flattened out in the final sixteenth and was caught late. MARY OF BETHANY settled near the rear outside BOURBON REBELLION early, advanced
through the field near the five eighths to track DOCS SEVEN, loomed outside the leader from near the three eighths while racing in the three path, was
outkicked by that foe into the lane, continued to chase on willingly three wide, but was outkicked by the winner and narrowly unable to catch the weakening
pacesetter. BOURBON REBELLION settled near the rear inside, continued in the two path on the rear flight on the turn, offered an inside bid under a drive
in upper stretch, but was outfinished late. FOX FREY chased toward the rear down the backstretch and three wide into the turn, raced at the rear in the five
path on the turn, came four wide into the lane, chased on mildly but lacked the needed kick to improve position. SHEZ STUCK UP attended inside of DOCS
SEVEN early, settled pack to track the leading pair from near the five eighths, chased them in the four path on the turn, began to lose position near the three
eighths, was driven three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
DRAFT CAPITAL settled at the inside of the rear flight, was taken out to the two to three path and pushed along near the three eighths, responded well with
a bid, split horses near the five sixteenths, raced into the lane outside of REGULAR GUY, headed him in upper stretch, and drove clear past the furlong
mark. REGULAR GUY tracked the leading pair outside of CLARESTOWN through the clubhouse turn, settled back to chase behind the tracking flight into
the back straight, was pushed along into the far turn and offered a bid, advanced to track the leader in the two path, continued to improve, took the lead
outside of CLEMSON TIGER near the five sixteenths, was engaged by DRAFT CAPITAL approaching the three sixteenths, raced inside him until the furlong
mark, and could not match strides with the winner from there. CLARESTOWN tracked the leading pair through the first turn, improved inside to track the
pacesetter inside of WHITE MIST down the backstretch, tracked in the pocket around the far turn, had no answer as DRAFT CAPITAL and REGULAR GUY
separated themselves from the rest of the field near the three sixteenths, and chased on best of the rest. SMOKEY HARBOR raced two wide in the rear
flight through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, was pushed along three wide on the far turn, improved to midfield, but could not match the
leading trio into the lane. WHITE MIST tracked the leader through the clubhouse turn, continued to track the pace outside of CLARESTOWN down the
backstretch, began to weaken between horses near the half, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn but continued to flatten out, and was no
further threat in the lane. CLEMSON TIGER broke inward, soon cleared to the lead, set the pace inside until headed at the five sixteenths, and emptied out.

Footnotes
VARSITY FLYGIRL saved ground around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around
the far turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire under a drive. MAYSTART raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked
the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and chased the winner home, the best of the
rest. LITTLE CHICK saved ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two path around the
far turn, swung to the outside in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final furlong while finishing evenly. ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM raced in the three path
around the first turn, dueled for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path, began to drop backing
approaching the quarter pole and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
PITAMAN cleared comfortably to the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, opened up under hand urging in upper stretch, and further increased his
advantage under a mild drive through the final furlong. GALAHAD KID soon trailed, took closer order in the two path on the turn, swung out into the lane in
the four path, improved three wide under a drive, and proved best of the rest while drifting out and in slightly. GIVIN UP NONE settled at the rear of the main
group, began to inch forward inside of PACHI past the five eighths, tracked the leader while saving ground on the turn, continued to ride the rail into the
lane, proved no match for the pacesetter, and flattened out late. PACHI chased the leading pair early, was relegated to the rear of the main group into the
turn, went to a drive in the three path past the three eighths, floated out into the lane in the five path, and offered no rally. RAHFEE TOWN tracked the
leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, came two wide into the lane, and was gradually outpaced.
