Footnotes
WAR CAT dueled, on the lead throughout, held gamely after a long stretch battle and and prevailed. CARDIOVERSION dueled with the winner throughout,
held stubbornly after a long drive and just missed. DIALIN SOME SASS was off a step slow, rallied in the stretch on the inside and finished well. SAINT
PATSY was never far back and saved ground, went evenly late. DARLING BELLE had good position early and lacked late response. TRINNI CUTIE PIE
was no factor. GRACEFUL PANTHER showed little and was outrun.
