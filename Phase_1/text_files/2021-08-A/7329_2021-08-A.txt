Footnotes
LEJEUNE set the pace from the outset, was in the three path into the lane and widened throughout under a steady drive. EDGE raced back early on, was in
the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane and prevailed for place in the final stages. TREASURE WILBURNYA was unhurried early on, raced in the
four path into the lane, rallied down the lane, split horses and just missed place at the wire. WACKER'S GIRL bobbled at the start, chased the pace early,
was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. NANA ROZE was never a threat. GINGERMYSISTER was through after a half.
CAROLINA'S THING had early speed then folded up.

nearing the lane, took over command in the stretch and drew away in the stretch under a brisk drive. MAYAPRETTY raced in the four path along the first
turn, stalked the pace early three wide, was in the three path into the lane and rallied for place down the lane. GUILDER set the pace early, was off the rail
into the lane and faltered in the stretch run. EUROPA was bumped and bothered at the start, chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and
moved up late in the stretch drive. NANCY WORK hopped inward at the start, was a bit keen into the first turn, tracked the early pace, was off the rail into
the lane and faded down the lane. MISS MCCOOL was steadied into the first turn from between horses. SUPER STEAMY was never a factor. CLASS RIOT
