MAMACALLMEBOO tracked the pace of MR. ATLANTICO from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and drew off through the lane with complete authority. AUDACE was off slow, raced unhurried early, advanced from off the rail through the turn and
finished with good energy. MR. ATLANTICO was bumped at the break, opened a clear lead soon after, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way
through the final furlong. DOUBLE PERFECTION was bumped at the start, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.
BLOODHORSE BUD showed brief speed, raced five-wide through the turn and weakened. STREET DEMAND lacked early speed, raced six-wide through
the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
MASTER RECOVERY tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, reached the fore and was bumped in mid-stretch and drew off
through the final yards. EDDIE AND THE KING was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, came in to bump the winner with a furlong to run
and gave way to that rival in the drive. BRAHMS FOREST settled off the leaders from the inside, gained a contending position approaching the stretch and
failed to gain late. BENNY THE JET disputed the pace with EDDIE AND THE KING while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. ON
THE WINGS OF raced four-wide through the first turn, lagged early, raced six-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. WINGS OF WISDOM
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY CONCERNING THE
BUMPING BETWEEN EDDIE AND THE KING AND MASTER RECOVERY IN MID-STRETCH AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED THAT
EDDIE AND THE KING HAD DRIFTED OUT AND CAUSED THE INFRACTION AND MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
LINCHPIN STORM sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, drew off through the lane and was ridden out to be kept to task.
SECLUDED HARBOR broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best.
SWEETWATER CLYDE was bumped at the start, then reserved just off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the turn and failed to gain in the drive.
REDDISH was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened in the drive. ROARRALLYROAR settled off the leaders from
between foes, steadied nearing the seven-sixteenths pole and failed to rally. VICKY'S DIAMOND lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. THOUGHTS OF GOLD was bumped at the break, was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. THE
RUBY OF LIFE was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.
