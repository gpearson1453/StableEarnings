Footnotes
COVER TWO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane with complete authority. MIDNIGHT SYMPHONY
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a striking position approaching the stretch and failed to gain in the winner
in the drive. ROBBERYINPROGRESS broke sharply to chase the winner while racing three-wide, angled out nearing the quarter and weakened. HALO OF
LIFE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and lacked the needed rally.

PROUD LION was bumped at the break, pressed the pace of HIGH SPEED CHASE while racing three-wide, moved up to engage that foe nearing the
three-eighths marker, was taken on by COASTAL BUZZ nearing the quarter, vied with that rival, waited for racing room when that foe drifted in and was
straightened away, then forged to the front in a well timed ride. COASTAL BUZZ raced four-wide through the first turn, stalked the leaders while racing
four-wide, drifted out approaching the stretch, vied with the winner, drifted in late and was straightened away and was caught. GABBY TOM settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished fastest of all. HIGH SPEED CHASE set a pressured
pace from the inside and weakened after going three-quarters. SENOR FABULOSO lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled
out into the stretch and did not menace. LITTLE BIG HOUSE was bumped at the start and lagged throughout. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY CONCERNING THE DRIFTING IN O COASTAL BUZZ IN THE FINAL YARDS AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED HER HAD

DREAMER'S REALITY was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin with a quarter to run and was ridden out.
MORE HONOR was off a step slow, raced just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished
well to gain the place. GENTLE PRINCE broke sharply to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. REGAZZE
CAT hopped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. WILD WILD KINGDOM was bumped at the break,

Footnotes
FREIBURG sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. COOL EDGE chased the winner
while racing three-wide throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. IRISH SWING lacked early speed, raced five-wide
through the turn and did not threaten. GRAND AIR was off a step slow, rushed to contend, chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened in the
drive. TCHULA SUNSET lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BALTIMORE BEECHO was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a furlong to run, vied and was up.
BUCKLEY BAY was away alertly to press the pace of ROMAN RUSH while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter, responded
when challenged by the winner in mid-stretch, vied and just missed in a game effort. LOLLY EXPRESS lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn and finished with good late energy. LICORICE DROP POPS was forwardly placed from the inside early, angled out into the stretch and failed to gain
late. ROMAN RUSH was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going a half. CRACK A COLD ONE was void of
early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. DICTION fell soon after the start and was vanned off.
