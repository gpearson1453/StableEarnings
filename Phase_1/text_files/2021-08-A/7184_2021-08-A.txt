LONG MAY YOU RUN dueled inside, dispatched that rival, was collared again by runner-up in the stretch, lost the lead and came again gamely.
PUTTHEGLASSDOWN advanced inside on the turn, engaged the winner, led and was outdueled. LOVERBOY LOU settled off the leaders then continued
well for the show. THOMAS KNIGHT dropped back inside and finished well along the rail. PSYCHIC ENERGY dueled with the winner outside and was
finished after half a mile. BOB'S MY UNCLE chased wide and was never in contention. PHARAOH'S CITY raced wide off the pace and was no factor.

DENNARD stalked the leaders three wide, edged to the front at the top of the stretch and drew off while kept to a drive. SPIRIT WOLF forced the pace
outside, took over midway on the turn and finished gamely for the place. SOPHOS saved ground off the leaders, moved out in the stretch with a mild bid.
LT. COLUMBO chased outside, moved very wide into the stretch then flattened out. BAVARIA moved clear inside for half a mile, was collared on the final
turn and faded. COMMISSIONER DAVE dropped back at the start and trailed throughout.

led narrowly, rallied clear then nailed nearing the wire. CAUSE I SAID SO settled close up inside, moved out in the stretch and gained slightly. I SAW IT ALL
broke alertly and vied outside then weakened in the final furlong. SECRET MAGICIAN chased close up outside and was finished after half a mile.
THEDUKE OF HAZZARD lagged far behind racing wide then passed a fading rival. JOHNNY WISHBONE raced between rivals briefly and began retreating
on the turn.

LEFTATTHEALTAR trailed briefly, advanced wide on the turn then drew away through the final furlong. LA ALTENITA bid three wide on the turn, ducked in
at the eighth pole and continued to race an erratic course. EVERYBODY'S PAL slipped through inside to duel, was taken up near the eighth pole but
continued well. MISS JASSER lagged far behind inside then moved wide on the turn. MISBEHAVING LADY raced wide off the leaders and failed to rally.
MARYEVIL was quickly in front in the two path, vied through the turn then proved empty. BRANDYWINE BABE saved ground off the leaders and was
always outrun. GET OVER IT dropped back early and gave way readily. Following an objection by the third finisher against the runner-up for interference in

FACTOR THIS IN forced the pace outside then vied on the rail, lost the lead then came again and pulled away. GOOD GOOD stalked the pace three wide,
bid and led on the turn but was no match late. AMERICAN ROMA stumbled at the start, rallied outside then flattened out. FINGLAS lagged far behind then
showed some late energy. ALGORIX led briefly inside then was finished after half a mile. KING'S GOLD dropped back inside and was never a factor.
NEIGHBORHOOD BULLY trailed far behind then caught a stopping rival late. BOAT OVER THE HILL prompted the pace three wide under rating then gave
way.

Footnotes
STARSHIP ARAMIS stalked the pacesetter, led into the stretch and edged away while kept to his task. SEAT OF HONOR dropped far behind, moved
outside and rallied mildly. WORTH HIS SALT sprinted clear to the final turn then weakened. THREE PHASE dropped far back in the two path and closed
gap while no threat. DRUMMER DON trailed briefly then passed fading rivals. EDEN RIDGE chased outside and never menaced. LEGACY'S PRINCE
chased inside, drifted out on the final turn and faded. KID MAC COOL was urged close up for half a mile and gave way. BANKER'S ISLAND broke very
slowly and was always far back. DIAMOND SQUARE settled outside just off the leaders and stopped.
