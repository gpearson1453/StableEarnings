Footnotes
WRATH was rushed to the lead to set the pace from the inside and drew off in the stretch drive under light urging. HYPER DRIVE tracked the leader from
the two path and lacked the late response in the drive. MATRICULATE stalked the pace from the three path then made a mild bid going into the final turn
and faltered. NATTYTYME chased the leaders from the inside but failed to menace. PANIC BUTTON was allowed to settle from the three path into the first
turn but raced wide throughout. RENVYLE had brief early speed then dropped back and was not a factor.

Footnotes
COUGAR COUNTRY broke sharply to set the pace from the two path then inched clear after a half and drew off in the stretch. NOW MIND YOU was
allowed to settle then made a two wide bid on the turn and closed willingly to be second best. FULKERSON was forwardly placed in the three path then
dropped back to settle and angled out at the head of the stretch but closed well to be up for the show. SLICK IT UP pressed the pace from the inside and
faded. BUDS BAR trailed the field and had his best strides late. CREASY was off slow and saved ground on the rail to give an even effort. TAYLOR'S
PRINCE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and weakened. SADDLE IN COMMANDO tracked the leaders from the three path and gave way.
