KWAI CHANG sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and was always in command under intermittent urging. A BRUSH OF LUCK swerved in sharply at
the start, stalked the pace and stayed on well in the stretch. WIN IN THE CITY raced in striking position while four wide, responded in the stretch and kept
on well. ROCKYMOUNTAIN BREW settled well, entered the stretch three wide and finished strongly. COLORFUL NATIVE forced in at the start, chased the
pacesetter and weakened in the late going. FORTHELOVEOF JESUS bumped at the start, was carried in early and never involved. SPALDING STROLL
outrun early, advanced on the turn and finished evenly in the stretch. EVIL KNIEVEL failed to threaten. FORGIVEN raced forwardly while four wide and
lacked a rally. STROLL LIKN OUTLAW was always outrun. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY TO THE START.
AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THEY DISQUALIFIED A BRUSH OF LUCK FOR CAUSING INTERFERENCE AND PLACED HIM SIXTH.

Footnotes
BYE LOVE GOTTA GO forced the pace, was outpaced leaving the turn and responded gamely in the late going to prevail. GIRLS IN CHARGE raced
forwardly while four wide, remained four wide into the stretch and finished willingly. GOLD MAKER dueled for the lead, edged clear leaving the turn and was
reeled in late. BLUSHING SCARLETT was outpaced while three wide and stayed on in the stretch. CALL THE SHOTS passed tired ones. BAYLEYWICK
raced in striking position and dropped back leaving the turn. REBEL RISING was always outrun. VICTORY BOLT was off slowly and no factor.
