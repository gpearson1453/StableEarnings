BOB'S CALLING was away alertly to set the pace while being well handled on the front end and racing towards the inside, drew clear leaving the turn then
drew off in the stretch while being kept to pressure to prove much the best. FUTURE VISION stalked the early pace three wide then made a bid to press the
pace three wide on the backstretch to the five sixteenths pole, but could not go with the winner the final quarter of a mile while clearly second best.
MAJESTIC MR. JONES was allowed to settle early while three wide, then was roused leaving the half mile marker, then was kept to steady urging but had
no rally while besting the rest. MONEY POINT chased the early pace on the inside and weakened. THE MILE FRACTION WAS OMITTED DUE TO A

FATE FACTOR set the pace on the inside while being well handled, then was sent down leaving the turn and responded well to draw clear by the furlong
marker, then was kept to right handed urging to prove best. COMPLETE was allowed to settle while three wide, then advanced four wide on the turn and
finished willingly late. OXUM POWER was reserved early while three wide, then advanced on the turn and was between rivals by the quarter pole, swung
out five wide for racing room and had a belated rally. OH SO TERRIBLE was allowed to settle early on the inside, made a inside bid entering the stretch but
needed more late. ROGUE TOO prompted the early pace two wide and made a three wide bid on the backstretch to press the pace but faded in the drive.
COLOR ME PRETTY was settled back early and moved out four wide entering the backstretch, then was fanned out six wide leaving the turn but lacked a
solid rally. JULIANA (PER) was well placed early on the inside, then moved out to make a bid three wide on the turn, was in between rivals by the quarter
pole but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
OVERJOY was allowed to settle early and came four wide into the drive, angled out by the sixteenths pole while making a bid and closed well to get up in
time under a drive. MACHO ALEGRE was well placed early on the inside, then moved out leaving the quarter pole to make a three wide bid, hit the front in
the furlong grounds and was clear nearing the sixteenths pole but it was not enough as he was caught late. RED LIAISON was reserved early and
advanced leaving the turn on the inside, then angled out by the furlong marker and rallied well late. BINGE set the pace while clear on the inside but
weakened in the final furlong, lost show award late. PRINCE ACT was bumped at the start, then chased the pace in between horses on the turn and
weakened in the drive. INDIGO RICH chased the pace four wide on the turn, then came six wide into the drive and weakened. THE BIG GUY was off very
slowly, then was four wide by the quarter pole while being no threat.

Footnotes
BIG BAND LUZZIANN was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, then drifted out under left handed urging nearing the furlong marker, then was
corrected with right handed urging and held sway late to prove best. PRINCESS NINA was reserved early, advanced on the turn, came five wide into the
drive and closed well on the outside. TIME FOR GLORY was well rated early on the inside, moved out to make a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole,
then was bumped by the winner and forced out by the furlong marker and hung late. LIGHTNING LOU (IRE) was bumped at the start, then was settled back
three wide on the backstretch, moved towards the rail in the stretch and finished willingly. CHOCTAW BINGO tracked the early pace and made a three wide
bid on the backstretch, then was forced out by the furlong marker and faded. AMANI'S LIONESS saved ground and offered no rally. YOGURT was allowed
to settle three wide early and stopped. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY AND THERE WAS A JOCKEYS OBJECTION LODGED THE #3 VERSUS
THE #1 FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE REPLAYS THE RACE WAS LEFT AS IS.
