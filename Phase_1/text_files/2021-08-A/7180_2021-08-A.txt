Footnotes
LEROY JENKINS pulled early behind the pace just off the inside, crept closer late in the final turn in the two path, in traffic entering the stretch, waited briefly
before split rivals nearing the furlong grounds, gained the advantage and drew clear while in hand late to win ridden out. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN used a
bit early to make the front while four wide into the first turn, clear up the backstretch, headed 2nd turn, vied past the furlong marker, proved no match for the
winner late, regained the place closet to the inside while under brisk encouragement. VETERAN'S HOLIDAY prompted the pace off the inside, fell back the
third quarter, moved out and came four wide out of the final turn, rebid past the furlong marker, gained the show spot over entrymate late. PEPPER JACK in
the second flight early, lodged a middle move to challenge outside the runner up in the second turn, narrowly showed the way into and through upper
stretch, hung the final furlong. WINDSOR ACADEMY settled off the pace, was never a threat. APACHE UNBRIDLED finished early, fell far back, jogged in.
OPENING QUARTER MILE SPLIT UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MAINTAINANCE MATT pressed in the two path out of the chute, continued to chase the leader up the backstretch, advanced and dueled outside that one
through the turn, edged away the final furlong under firm handling. WICKED CITI in the second flight closest to the inside, shifted out a bit for the drive,
finished willingly to be up for the place while slowly getting to the winner late. BUCKETS broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, dueled inside the
winner through the turn, gradually weakened down the lane, caught late for the place. FAST VERDICT in the second group early outside, dropped inside for
the run through the turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. BROADWAY JONES in the second flight up the backstretch while
between horses, roused three wide turning for home, came up empty for the run to the wire. WITCH DOCTOR lacked early foot, failed to mount a rally
through the stretch. ZING ZANG trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
TOTALLY ADDICTED broke with the leaders, fell back to trail before a quarter, two path turn, dropped inside turning for home, got through into the lane,
switched back out when moving on the leaders past the furlong marker, finished full of run to win going away. GROSSE TETE IAN bumped from both sides
at the break, back off the early pace toward the inside, steered out to be four wide exiting the turn, closed with good resolve while no match for the winner.
BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL chased the leader for a half, had little left for the final furlong. IZEISMAGA broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, continued
to show the way past the furlong marker, headed late and faltered to lose several positions. SMOKY TOPAZ back off the pace, raced between rivals late in
the turn, floated out between horses entering the stretch, made little impact in the run to the wire. HERMS CROWN broke in to bump the runner up to be last
away, moved outside, floated out to be six wide entering the stretch, failed to muster a closing response. LOUISIANA THUNDER broke out, bumped the
runner up, was straightened to race within striking distance for three furlongs, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT SPIRIT with the pace from the start off the inside, dueled through the turn, shook clear past the furlong marker, held the runner up safe late
under steady handling. SECRET VISTA lacked early foot, saved ground when with the main body through the turn, moved off the inside a bit for the drive,
finished up willingly to be in time for the place. CUSTOM KAT settled off the pace, roused into the lane while off the inside, outkicked late for the place, clear
of the others. NOSY BANKER dueled up front inside the winner, first to blink while turning for home. SEMI CHARMED LIFE in the second group while
racing off the inside, three wide and between foes exiting the turn, failed to muster a closing response. VON DOM within striking distance while racing
outside, four wide into the lane, also was found lacking when the real running began. PRINCE LOKI remained back in failing to threaten. CALLTHEWOLFE
trailed most of the way to be always outrun. P T'S FLASH last to leave, improved a bit on the outside turn, tired while four wide into the lane.

CLEVER RACER broke alertly, narrowly showed the way out of the chute, continued to set the pace up the backstretch and into the turn, shook clear
entering the stretch, held the runner up safe late under firm left then right handed pressure. HOMELAND MESSA settled behind the pace, raced off the
inside through the turn, three wide into the lane when put to pressure, slowly gaining on the winner late, clearly second best. DISTINCT QUALITY void of
speed, saved ground when remaining back through the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, finished up best of the rest. MUSICAL MAN chased the winner for
four furlongs and had little left for the drive. MY LITTLE ADRIAN broke out, raced off the pace, three wide into the lane, failed to rally. SIXTO was finished
early while racing outside. FINAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
PARK RIDGE BENNY outrun for a half, raced inside through much of the turn, angled out to be five wide into the lane, closed with a flourish to win going
away. GREELEY'S BANKER broke on top, narrowly showed the way for a half in the two path, three wide briefly when challenged into the lane, came in
soon after, was straightened then repelled that rival inside the furlong marker, proved no match for the winner late. FAMILIAR RHYTHM broke back, void of
speed while well out in the strip, came six wide for the drive, rallied down the middle of the strip to earn the show in the final strides, not a serious threat to
the top two. SANDYS BLAZE broke out to brush with FLASHY IMAGE, was straightened to race well back inside, steered out and loomed boldly four wide
turning for home, showed the way past the furlong marker then faltered late to lose position, caught in the final stride for the show. GIANT MESA settled in
mid pack for a half, moved closer when bothered slightly when the runner up came in upper stretch, quickly recovered and finished up evenly in lacking a
closing punch. FLASHY IMAGE brushed at the start, raced well back most of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided.
FLASHYBOY BOBB forwardly placed for a half outside, tired while four wide out of the turn. SONG N A CAT pressed the pace along the inside for almost
five furlongs and gave way in the drive.

BLESSED ANNA patiently handled while behind the pace and saving some ground for five furlongs, crept closer late in the final turn while under continued
restraint, let out a notch when straightened for home, split foes past the furlong marker and drew clear under steady handling. BELLAMY CAY broke alertly,
pressed the leader from the outside, fell back off that one a bit when straightened for home, drifted out past the furlong marker, proved no match for the
winner late, up for the place. PLATINUM QUEEN moved up to narrowly show the way first turn, continued to set the pace in the run up the backstretch and
through the final turn, briefly offered resistance to the winner when that one challenged with a furlong remaining then faltered to also lose the second spot in
the waning strides. TECATE TIME broke out, fell back to trail, continued to lag far turn, came four wide into the lane, went evenly through the stretch in
lacking a late response. SPELLBINDING off a step slow, moved up to within striking distance early, maintained a forward position for six furlongs and began
to weaken, continued to falter in the drive. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MENZEL broke with the field, fell back the opening quarter, swept up four wide to become a forward factor turning for home, challenged past the furlong
marker and kicked clear under steady handling. TAKENFORGRANTED lacked speed just off the inside, raced in the two path through the turn, split foes in
midstretch and finished up willingly to be clear for the place. KASEN'S SISTER bumped, shuffled back at the start, continued back, came five wide out of the
turn, staged a mild rally to be in time for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. DARING DARIAN void of speed, saved some ground through the turn
while still back, improved position through traffic down the lane. CUSTOM FOR ALY fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke with the field, raced in the
second flight and within striking distance for three furlongs then came up empty for the drive. MISS LINDA LOU away well, cleared to the inside, set the
pace for four furlongs, faltered when headed by the winner in midstretch. IAM DAKOTA chased the leader for three furlongs, gave way in the drive. ANNIE'S
LUCK in the second flight while between foes, faltered. MISS FRO ZEN lacked speed, four wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally.
