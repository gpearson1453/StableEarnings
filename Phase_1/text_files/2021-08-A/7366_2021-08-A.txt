Footnotes
JARLIAN , inside horses around the first turn and entering the backstretch, angled out leaving the backstretch, advanced four deep on the far turn,
challenged for the lead outside ROYALIAN in upper stretch and got the good bob at the finish. ROYALIAN lightly bumped with VLAJKO leaving the starting
gate, raced three wide on both turns, gained the lead mid way on the far turn and dug in stubbornly in the drive to just miss. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , five
deep mid way on the far turn, had aim on the lead turning for home and flattened. ICHIGO , three wide the first turn, moved in entering the far turn, swung to
the four path approaching the stretch and failed to rally. RAEFORD hugged the inner rail while chasing the pace and gave way entering the stretch. VLAJKO
lightly bumped with ROYALIAN leaving the starting gate, set the pace in the two path, tired after six furlongs and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
CLEVER AND GREAT cleared early, set a rated pace off the inside, kept REPLICANT at bay leaving the far turn, moved away a bit past the five sixteenths,
was set down past the three sixteenths, switched over to his left lead in deep stretch and lasted. REPLICANT , sluggish from the gate, moved up four wide
around the first turn and gained a stalking spot, took closer order under strong handling into the far turn, gave hard pursuit past the five sixteenths, shifted in
past the three sixteenths, came back out through the final furlong and finished gamelyt to gain. TINY TIN , bumped at the start, lagged off the pace, raced
two wide into the stretch, angled out and rallied mildly. STAND MY GROUND broke inward and bumped with a rival, corrected and stalked inside, was
under a ride into the lane, eased out and came up empty. GLORIOUS WEEKEND saved ground early, angled out and circled four wide into the lane but
failed to generate a serious kick. MANKLIN CREEK prompted the early pace two wide, dropped back nearing the far turn, shifted in and failed to respond.

CYNERGY'S STAR sped to the early lead, set the pace along the rail and was under brisk urging in the drive. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , two wide throughout,
gamely chased the winner through the stretch. TWIST 'N TWIRL saved ground on the turn, remained near the rail in the stretch, swung outside near the
sixteenth pole and lacked the necessary rally in an even effort. BALTIMORE BULLEIT hesitated at the break, swung to the four path leaving the turn and
was no factor. SUMMER ASH hesitated at the break, raced three wide on the turn and gave way. GALLANT GOLD had his rider lose his irons when buck
jumping about a sixteenth of a mile after the break. There was a stewards inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.

Footnotes
LITTLEBITALILY was urged from the gate and took command inside rivals, was taken to rate after about a sixteenth of a mile and handled outside pressure,
shook clear when set down in upper stretch, kept on under stout right handed encouragement and held sway. RAVENEL , off the pace two wide, worked her
way between runners entering the stretch, shifted out a bit and closed steadily. JEANIE'S ANGEL vied outside the winner, came three to four wide for the
drive and faded late. JOYFUL NOISE saved ground while making some headway into the turn, was urged pursuing mid turn, came out late but failed to
generate a solid run. CALYPSO GHOST lacked speed, circled the turn five wide and failed to menace. SCARLET TANAGER stalked a contested pace
three wide, was under asking nearing the lane, failed to kick on in upper stretch, dropped back and was eased late.

STARBURST sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, kept on under strong handling leaving mid stretch and dug in tenaciously through the final
yards to prevail. GOING TO THE LEAD , brushed at the break, edged up inside under some rating and took a stalking stance, eased out in upper stretch,
bid between rivals in deep stretch, kept on gamely but just could not get past. HEIR PORT , four deep into the turn, took closer order three wide into the
lane, ranged up past mid stretch while on his left lead and was out finished. RAD PAISLEY was squeezed back leaving the gate and away last, recovered
and rated towards the inside, eased out then progressed between runners into the lane, angled off heels in upper stretch and rallied. ABUELO PAPS , off
the pace and three wide mid turn, angled five to six wide for the drive, straightened and closed belatedly. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , three wide between
runners nearing the turn, was under coaxing past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on in upper stretch and faded. AIN'T DA BEER COLD , five wide nearing
the half mile marker, remained well wide leaving the three eighths, edged up some in upper stretch, checked off heels soon after, altered in and faded.
HIGHER PURPOSE , brushed at the start, chased two wide between runners, failed to keep pace mid turn and weakened. There was a stewards' inquiry
into the stretch run. No action was taken

DEPOSITORY made the early without urging, saved ground around the turns, lost the advantage near the eighth pole then determinedly battled back to
regain the lead in deep stretch. JOHNNY SACK , two wide stalking the pace, responded in upper stretch, gained a short lead near the eighth pole, finished
willingly but was not good enough. BOUNCING AROUND , up close throughout, hugged the inner rail around the far turn and failed to rally in an even
performance. CALL ME PLUCKY , outside horses down the back stretch, raced two wide on the far turn and gave way. SUPER E , well placed along the
inner rail down the backstretch, gave way on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
GRECIAN PHAROAH stalked the pace under patient handling, circled the far turn three wide, gained command in upper stretch and pulled away while kept
to his business. JESTFUL , sent to the early lead, set the pace along the rail, lost the advantage in upper stretch and weakened the final furlong. BRIDGE
OF HOPE , taken to the inner rail mid way on the first turn, remained along the rail to the eighth pole, swung out and failed to rally. ONE MOST WANTED
prompted the pace outside JESTFUL,, failed to keep up on the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and gave way. WOLF RANGER lacked speed, was
under urging entering the far turn and fell back.
