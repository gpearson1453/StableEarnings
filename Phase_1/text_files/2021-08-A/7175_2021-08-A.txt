MELISANDRE had inside speed under pressure, opened up final turn, drew out to win as she pleased with no asking, being taken in hand late. MARIANDA
steadied at the break, forced pace outside for half, well placed into final turn, was no match for the winner. REASONABLE CAUSE stalked forced pace off
rail, lacked needed rally. MAIBELLA showed little.
