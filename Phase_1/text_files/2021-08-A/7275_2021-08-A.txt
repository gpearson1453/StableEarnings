Footnotes
STREET VOSS bumped at the start, vied for the early advantage, raced three wide around the turn, pulled away down the stretch and proved much the
best. FAR BEYOND lacked early speed, made a steady gain, rallied wide, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. GREY ROGUE showed
early speed, saved ground around the turn, forwardly placed throughout and got caught late for second. SAUL GOOD MAN dueled for the early lead, faded
and was no threat late. CROOKED BANKER bumped at the start, broke near the front, eased back and finished evenly. OOBY DOOBY broke sharp,
dropped back and was outrun. FANCY LANCY raced within striking distance, dropped back and trailed. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

Footnotes
HAPPY SONRISA unhurried in the early part, moved up on the inside around the second turn, made a bid, racing three wide and got up in time. MISS
AGGIE BLING went to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail, led until late, was caught at the wire. FETCHING FURY lacked early speed, saved ground
around the final turn, made a late rail bid, finished willingly and was outfinished by the top two. FIANNA HILLS raced within contention, made a mild bid and
followed the top three to the wire. G'S DEADLINE raced in the middle of the field, saved ground around the final turn and put forth an even effort.
WENEEDTOTALK lacked early speed and was never close. GET DIRECTIONS pressed the early pace and faded late. MARRAZANO always raced near
the back, was pulled up deep in the home stretch and vanned off. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

AUTOMATIC raced in the middle of the field, made a late rail bid, was no match for the winner, but was clear of others. SCRAPBOOK dueled on the front
end, drove clear around the final turn, but couldn't match strides with the top two. FOLD EM pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and weakened
down the stretch. HENNYS GRINNING raced within contention, evenly behind the leaders and faded. BAD GAL RIRI void of early speed and was never a
factor. SWEETASBAILY broke a step slow, raced evenly near the back and showed little. MAIRSILS FIRST vied for the early lead, saved ground around the

turn three wide, rallied down the lane, dueled to the wire and missed. TWN TAWFEERS PARTY raced in the back of the pack, showed late interest, but was
no match for the top two. JEWELED CROWN dueled on the front end, saved ground around the final turn and faded. HOPEITSAMIRACLE raced within
contention, came around the second turn on the outside, made a bid and dropped back down the lane. GINA'S PIE always raced near the back and showed

GOLDEN PALACE raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied and was going away at the end. THEBOYZHOUR broke
slow, racing from the back, came around the turn on the outside, made a wide rally, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SLAM'S MAN
raced within contention, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. CRYPTOZONIC lacked early speed, made a late inside bid and was outfinished
for third. ALMA DERBY raced near the back, improved position, but was no factor. HOT TEN raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn
and faded. SPREAD THE FAITH was an early factor, made a steady retreat, while finishing wide. D'YETI MAN sprinted to the front, drove clear, saved
ground and was finished early. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
