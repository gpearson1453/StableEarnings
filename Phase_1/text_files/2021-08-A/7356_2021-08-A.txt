Footnotes
LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS broke on top, shared the lead outside NURSE KATIE, moved clear when allowed on the bend, was roused into the lane then
steadily drew away while kept to urging until the last seventy yards. NURSE KATIE contested the early pace from inside, did not stay with
LITTLEBITOFBLUSKYS on the turn, angled out some at the top of the stretch and could only draw off for the place. SUNDAY ATTACK a step slow at the
start, was soon well back from the top pair, saved ground on the turn, fanned out for the drive and had no late bid. THURSDAY ATTACK hesitated at the
break, spotting the rest at least a length, was soon far back, raced a bit greenly and was unresponsive to urging in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNEEKY moved outside MARQUEE COWBOY early on, advanced to share the lead into the bend, moved clear when asked upper stretch, was put to a
drive inside the furlong marker and drew off from the rest. MARQUEE COWBOY soon took the lead and the inside, was challenged into the turn, did not
stay with UNEEKY into the stretch, was no match for that one when set down for the drive but was unchallenged for the place. LILALEE void of speed,
though hustled along from the early going, was widest taking the bend and passed outside tired ones the last furlong to gain third. ROSES FOR DOUG
chased from between rivals, advanced to gain third upper stretch but leveled off in the waning yards. FLASHY LOOK raced in contention from inside for a
half mile then gave way.

Footnotes
IT'S BELLAMY TIME soon had the advantage from inside, was challenged on the bend, came off the rail some into the lane, brushed repeatedly with BILLY
NOT WILLIAM as he battled to hold on and narrowly prevailed. BUBBA CABALLO chased from outside, lost ground four wide through the turn, rallied
belatedly the final furlong and just missed. BILLY NOT WILLIAM in contention early between horses, went for the lead three wide on the bend, angled in
beside IT'S BELLAMY TIME leaving the turn, lugged in some to brush repeatedly with the latter as he fought for the lead and lacked the extra needed in the
waning yards. TO THE BANK prominent between rivals, did not keep two wide on the turn, had to angle out five wide at the top of the lane for a clear path,
and gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure as he closed the gap inside the final furlong. MESSED UP soon trailed, came widest into the stretch
and gradually improved position without threatening. BOLD ATTACK displayed early speed just outside IT'S BELLAMY TIME, was caught in tight quarters
with two furlongs to go and gave way through the lane. HESLUCK chased from just off the inside, fanned out for the stretch run and had no late bid.

HOLD THE SPENDING rated from inside, came off the rail some on the bend, fanned to the outside of horses entering the stretch, rallied under a drive and
got up in time under a well judged ride. HALO COUTURE crowded briefly shortly after entering the main track, took over the lead two wide on the turn,
moved clear under a drive in the stretch but slowly wore down in the late going. MISS LEARJET was altered in shortly after leaving the chute, trying to keep
a clear path inside NO LETTIN GO, advanced three wide on the turn then found best stride too late from between horses deep stretch. NO LETTIN GO
soon had the lead and was steadily angled toward the inside but began to yield from inside with three furlongs to go.

EFFLORESCE rated on the front end from inside, moved clear when allowed on the second bend, was under a drive in the stretch, all out the final furlong,
drifted out some under left-handed pressure but held on. ENCHILADA forwardly placed from inside, swung out to path three entering the lane, moved clear
for second upper stretch, steadily drifted out while also under left-handed pressure the last sixteenth, came up short but was clearly second best. BETTER
ANGELS raced in contention from outside, lost ground four then five wide taking the bend, moved clear for third upper stretch then could only just hold her
position. ANGEL'S RUN prominent from between rivals, began to yield three wide on the second turn, moved to the inside at the top of the stretch and
continued to flatten. FANCY EMPRESS vied for the lead outside EFFLORENSCE on the backstretch, did not keep up on the second bend, floated out
entering the stretch and faded further. BIG LUCK failed to menace in a wide trip.

KALISPELL was kept close, took the lead from between rivals nearing the end of the first quarter mile, drew clear and stayed just off the inside on the bend,
drifted out some upper stretch, was put to a drive inside the last furlong and kept DARLIN ROSIE at bay. DARLIN ROSIE forwardly placed between rivals,
did not keep up just off the inside on the turn, followed KALISPELL into the lane, moved inside as the latter came out some upper stretch, was all out, the
final eighth, came up short but was clearly second best. LIL BIT TIPSEY helped prompt the pace from outside, moved clear for second three wide on the
bend but began to wear down the last furlong. SEA MY MOVES broke in stride, moved clear and took the inside, was headed midway on the backstretch,
began to yield on the turn and continued to flattened out through the stretch.

INDICIA rated from inside, rallied in the stretch, altered out three wide for a clear path with a sixteenth to go, surged between horses and got up in time.
PASSION'S IMAGE in contention early, had the rail through the bend, rallied to edged ahead inside the last furlong but was outfinished. QUEENS GIFT kept
close between rivals, was two wide on the turn, fanned out outside FOGGY KITTEN for the drive, drifted out some midstretch, was soon straightened and
found best stride too late. FOGGY KITTEN broke in stride and was hustled away from the rest, stayed just off the inside taking the bend and gradually wore
down between horses in the lane. TAP'S LULLABY chased from outside, was three then four wide through the turn, angled out some as QUEENS GIFT
came out midstretch and showed a willingness to run the final furlong. WELL MAID soon trailed, stayed well off the inside and had little to offer for the drive.

HOOKED ON JORDAN pressed, was all out and got up in time. RELENTLESS JESSIE vied for the lead, was under a steady drive and outfinished in a
game effort. ITS THE WHISKEY broke a bit outward, bumped HEROSWIDEOPEN, recovered to press RELENTLESS JESSIE but lacked the needed late
kick. MASTER OVER GONE drifted out some early and was gaining late. IMA SECRET DAISY was a step slow at the start then ran evenly.
HEROSWIDEOPEN bumped just after the start, was veering out inside the 220 yard marker and was taken in hand.
