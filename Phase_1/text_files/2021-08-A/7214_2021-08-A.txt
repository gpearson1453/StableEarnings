then gave up second mid-stretch. WE GOT THE MONEY saved ground off the pace, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on
the far turn and showed little in the lane. ITSAHATTATACK stalked off the rail, challenged nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back from between

OUR DIAMOND GIRL chased and raced in range off the rail on the turn, dueled to the lead mid-stretch then widened the final sixteenth under steady
encouragement. OPEONGO set the pace while tapering to the inside, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the turn, was caught mid-stretch then
flattened inside the sixteenth pole. PRIVATELY was shut off at the start and raced well back from early contention, raced in the six path of the turn, finished
well for third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. GOOD KARMA engaged in close early chase but steadied at the rail in the vicinity of the five
sixteenths pole, recovered stride into the turn then flattened later yards. TALENT EXPECTED chased through the backstretch, raced wide on the turn then
flattened the final sixteenth. UNCANNY ducked out across the path of Privately leaving the gate then picked up the chase inside, checked while in tight at
the withers of DISTORTED SPLENDOR in the vicinity of the five sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little further, while the latter,
chased off the rail, rounded the turn about the three path, left the turn in the five path, and showed little more. KALENJIN never factored.

MISSING MY POINT pressured the early pace inside, eased just outside of Mosler's Touch approaching the head of the lane, drifted a bit into the stretch
but took the lead a sixteenth away and widened through later yards. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL was shuffled back on the chute then angled to the inside to
give chase, rounded the turn near the rail, came around Mosler's Touch mid-stretch and took over second later yards. FEAR THE DIVA chased through the
backstretch, rounded the turn in the three and four paths and raced evenly down the lane. MOSLER'S TOUCH set a pressured pace while tapering to the
inside, raced near the rail on the turn, was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. COLETTE'S SPIRIT chased well back, ran near the rail on
the turn, angled to the three path approaching the top of the lane and finished evenly. LOOKIN BACK gave chase, rounded the turn in the five path and
showed little more. AMERICA'S GIRL came out across the path of Brandyurafinegirl leaving the gate, picked up the chase inside then weakened at the rail
approaching the eighth pole.

WILLIAM AND MARY took an immediate lead to rate the pace inside, was hand urged leaving the five sixteenths pole, came under a drive past the eighth
pole and held on well. CAYENNE CREEK stalked off the rail the first turn, challenged from the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn,
then dueled through the stretch for second while gaining slowly on the winner. RUSH TO THE CASTLE settled off the early pace in the three path, started a
bid toward the five sixteenths pole, ran in the four path of the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. BUFF'S EYE VIEW raced off the pace
in the four path the first turn and left the turn outside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn still in the four path then flattened the final
sixteenth. AWSOME FAITH settled off the pace in the three path the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the
four path and showed little further. SILVER TAURUS saved ground.

MY PRETTY EYES took the lead at the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace inside, widened at the rail on the turn, came under pressure into the
stretch and extended her lead under vigorous hand urging. HANDSOME JOANIE gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then dug
in to take second the final strides. SWISS HORIZON chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, came under steady stretch handling but
was outfinished for second the final strides. FIGHT LIKE CERSEI chased outside, rounded the turn in the five path and passed rivals in an even finish.
REAL APPEAL chased toward the inside, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little further. MARY BOPPINS TOO became a bit edgy in the gate, gave
early chase toward mid track, raced near the rail on the turn then weakened. MARLEESBEEBEE was hesitant to load, came away rank and proved no
factor. CHARITABLE SHOW raced well back and saved ground on the turn.
