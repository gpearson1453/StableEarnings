Footnotes
MIZSPELT broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate through the turn, shrugged off the other speed to be clear past the
furlong marker, drifted in, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. GYPSY'S SOULMATE also broke in good order, alternated up front outside
the winner, held a narrow advantage late in the turn, could not match strides with the that same rival the final furlong, held sway for the place. THE FLUSH
KING prompted the top two from the outside, three wide late in the turn, lost some ground to that pair turning into the lane, getting back to the runner up late
late. BENBOW CAT broke toward the front, went one paced throughout while racing toward the inside, lacked closing punch. OUR BUCKET LIST broke
back, lacked speed, improved position slightly while making little in the way of an impact. OLE STUD MUFFIN last away, raced back in lacking speed, four
wide turning for home, failed to muster a serious response. MY PAL GREELEY in mid pack while off the inside, faded through the stretch. DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
TALE OF A STORM broke on top, sprinted clear soon after under mild hand encouragement into the turn, drew out through the lane under token
encouragement to win ridden out. JAKE THE BAND MAN close up early inside the winner, fell back to head up the second flight into the turn, moved out
and chased in the two path into the stretch, proved no match in the run to the wire, well clear of the others. GREELEY'S BANKER raced in the second flight
between horses, dropped to the inside for the drive, finished up best of the rest. ONEHOLYLION went one paced throughout in lacking a late kick.
COLONEL PIKE off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
LOVEU AND PROUDOFU broke well, fell back to race in the second flight three wide, continued behind the pace into the lane, late acceleration under a
right handed crop to finish well and win going away. SATURDAY'S GOLD broke with the leaders, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, disposed of
the other speed to be clear late in the turn, proved no match for the winner late, held the place spot while under pressure. LITTLE CAN settled off the pace
and the inside, behind some traffic in mid pack late in the turn, late interest toward the inside when clear late to be gaining for the place. GRIEF last away,
void of speed for three furlongs, came on the outside for the drive, improved position to be also gaining for the second splot. SMITTYS PATRIARCH moved
up to vie in the first flight three wide for a quarter and weakened. BUNKIE'S SONG with the pace while between horses, also began to back up after two
furlongs. OH MY ACHING ARCH remained always back. CREOLE CHARLIE broke out, shied and appeared to jump early to fall back to trail, jumped again
at the gate tracks in mid stretch, wrapped up.

Footnotes
TENSAS THOUGHT broke on top, narrowly set the pace along the inside for a half, shook clear into the far turn, maintained a comfortable advantage
through the lane while being kept to task. JET SWEEP last away, trailed for five furlongs, four wide into the far turn when beginning to advance, three wide
into the lane, no match winner, remained clear for the runner up position. STORIED TRIP settled off the pace and the inside, improved into the lane, altered
course to the outside with a sixteenth remaining, finished up evenly to report home best of the rest. SEBS PRINCESS went one pace throughout in lacking a
response in the drive. SPECIAL CONNECTION within striking distance for a half, weakened. THEBOYZGALAXY pressed the winner in the two path for four
furlongs, stopped second turn, eased up late, walked across the wire. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FREEDOM FACTOR unhurried for five furlongs off the inside, moved out went beginning to advance four wide far turn, steadily advanced through that bend,
challenged on the outside of the first flight nearing midstretch, quickly clear to prove clearly best. GOTTA GO also void of early foot, closer inside into the far
turn, briefly waited midway on that bend, steered widest into the straight, finished willingly to be well clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. FOOLISH
STEVE within striking distance just off the inside, remained within striking distance into the lane, proved no match for the top pair late, narrowly gained the
nod for the show. TIGERBEACH back off the early pace and the inside, lodged an early move to challenge far turn, dueled through the remainder of that
bend and into the lane and then weakened when headed by the winner approaching midstretch. LEMONIST settled off the pace and the inside, failed to
respond when called on for the drive. CHOP CHOP CHARLIE in mid pack, raced in some traffic into the far turn, lacked a rally in the drive. THREE RUN
HOMER broke on top, set a quick pace while closest to but not on the rail, dueled second turn, gave way drive. MOMENT pressed the issue off the inside
for a half and faltered, jogged in.

HOPE FOR CHANGE forwardly placed outside, advanced three wide through the turn to challenge on the outside turning for home, shook clear nearing
midstretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. STEALING APRIORITY lacked speed, asked four wide turning for home, slowly getting to
the winner late, clearly second best. TOO TUFF TO CRY last to leave, trailed early, came five wide out of the turn, along for the show, no threat to the top
two. HESACALENDARBOY moved up to vie in the run up the backstretch, dueled turn, weakened in the drive. IDE B STRANDED moved up along the
inside to contest the issue midway up the backstretch, dueled turn closest to the inside, also faltered through the stretch. TENPINS TERRITORY pressed
early, began to give way in the turn, continued to fade stretch. FIRE WATCH finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
SPECTROLITE moved up to duel early off the inside, shook clear into the turn as the other speed was checked up along the rail, maintained daylight into
and through the stretch under steady handling. HAIL STATE 2nd flight, slight steady as BLACK SWORD was checked up in front of him into the turn, could
do little with the winner through the stretch, held sway for the second spot. X CLOWN behind the leaders off the inside, continued to race outside and
avoided traffic trouble to his inside entering the turn, lacked a serious closing response, saved the show. TAPIZARS SECRET last to leave, trailed early as a
result, checked across BLACK SWORD'S heels as that rival was checked up into the turn, modest late interest after recovering down the lane. BLACK
SWORD broke alertly, dueled up front along the rail inside the winner, checked up in apparent tight quarters into the turn, fell back to lose all chance.
CLAIMS OF FOUL BY THE RIDERS OF BOTH HAIL STATE AND BLACK SWORD AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE
ENTERING THE TURN WERE NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
ANTIETAM ROAD broke with the leaders, narrowly showed the way through the first turn, continued to set a contested pace up the backstretch and through
the final turn while saving ground, shook clear when straightened for home and slowly drew out under steady pressure. COMMON LAW CAT pressed the
winner for six furlongs in the two path, could not match that one through the stretch, clearly second best. MY LITTLE ADRIAN four wide into the first turn,
prompted the pace while racing three wide throughout, could not keep up with the top pair through the lane, held the show late. YOUNG THOMAS void of
speed raced outside, roused backstretch, moved in a bit, continued to feel a right handed crop through the final turn, improved position into the lane, slowly
gaining for the show. AFLEET ROGER behind the pace while four wide into the first turn, continued to race outside while moving a bit closer the middle half
mile, four wide once again in the second bend, came up empty for the stretch run. MY GUITAR remained back in failing to threaten. G CISIVE was finished
early, reported home far back. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
NIN TO WIN broke back, moved closer along the inside into the far turn, in some traffic through that bend, roused three wide into the lane, finished full of run
outside the leader to nail that one on the wire. PRISSY JADEN unhurried early, moved out and began to advance into the far turn, strongly to the fore
entering the straight, well clear, caught in the late going. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN also lacked early speed, three wide in the run up the backstretch and into
the far turn, staged a mild rally behind the top two while five wide into the lane, no match for that pair, clear of the rest. OAK HILL SENIORITA devoid of any
early speed, passed tiring rivals to improve position, not a serious threat. WHO DAT GREY broke on top, narrowly set the pace in dueling up front off the
inside, gave way in the drive. STORM BREACH alternated up front closest to the inside for almost six furlongs and also faltered in the drive. SWEET
JACKIELEIGH within striking distance while racing off the inside, tired after five furlongs. VALERIE LOUISE forwardly placed early, began a steady retreat
before four furlongs. CAUSEWAYCAT five wide into the first turn, gave way before a half, finished far back. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL
TIME WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
