Footnotes
NOSTALGIA stalked the leading duelers from just off of their flanks while in the three path around the turn, grinded away at ANOTATION's advantage
through the final furlong after that foe kicked clear, and wore that foe down on the wire to dead heat for the win. ANOTATION dueled for the lead inside of
ZIGGY'S STORM, shook clear of that foe passing the three sixteenths pole as NOSTALGIA pursued, met that foe's bid inside the final sixteenth, and was
caught on the wire to dead heat for the win. BEACH PEACH tracked two wide, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and produced a mild kick to chase the
leading pair home. IKE LIKES saved ground off of the pace, and improved inside of foes in midstretch without threatening the leaders.
MINNIEMOREPROMISES chased from the four path into the turn, and faded thereafter. ZIGGY'S STORM dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened
between horses passing the three sixteenths pole. BLUE GRASS ANNA broke well, but steadily faded early on, and was outrun.

RED LABEL set the pace inside of a trio of vying rivals, scooted clear from them passing the five sixteenths pole, and drew off while kept to task on his left
lead through the lane. CREATIVE BID stalked the leading group from along the inside, shifted five wide approaching the five sixteenths pole, advanced to
claim place entering the lane with many lengths to find on the winner, and proved second best. BRAZIL NUT threw his head at the start and lagged behind
the field into the turn, shifted four wide entering the lane, and moved up for a minor share. EXCLAIM broke inwards a bit, pressed the pace four wide, but
failed to keep pace with his innermost rival at the five sixteenths pole, lost place entering the lane, and tired thereafter. ELI vied for the lead two wide and
between horses, but faded at the five sixteenths pole. DEALMEINBUD vied for the lead three wide and between horses, but weakened at the five sixteenths
pole, then was eased through the final furlong.

GOOD PENNY stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole, assumed command entering the lane as FLASHY BIZ pursued, and safely
held sway from that foe to the wire. FLASHY BIZ tracked from off of the pace three to four wide, ranged up to the leaders turning for home as GOOD
PENNY produced a bid, failed to keep pace with that foe entering the lane, but kept on thereafter to prove second best. MENDING stalked along the inside,
then chased the leaders home without producing a bid. DANCE ON OVER pressed the pace two wide, but gave way between horses passing the five
sixteenths pole. TORCH OF HONOR set the pace along the inside, but was headed by the eventual winner at the quarter pole, and weakened through the
lane. LETTERS TO BELLE was outrun.

Footnotes
SULLY'S BRO pressed the pace two wide, vied around the far turn before forging an advantage at the quarter pole, showed the way into the lane with
UNEMBLESSISHED menacing, repelled that foe's bid inside the final furlong, then cleared a sixteenth out and shifted ground outwards approaching the
wire. UNEMBELLISHED tracked from midpack along the inside, advanced when the pace slowed down the backstretch to track two wide and between
horses into the far turn, shifted three wide and outside of SULLY'S BRO entering the lane as that foe took charge, inched closer approaching the furlong
grounds, but was repelled leaving that station, and proved second best. COOL RUNNINGS stalked along the inside, steadied when pulling closer to the
leader into the backstretch, patiently awaited room while saving ground around the far turn as outer foe's ranged up, shifted two wide in upper stretch, and
chased the leaders home while gaining show. SAILOR'S RETURN saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, pulled to a three wide tracking position
between horses down the backstretch when the pace slowed, held that path around the far turn before tipping four wide in upper stretch, but only managed
to chase the leaders without progressing, then lost show late. PURE COURAGE tracked from midpack three to four wide, pressed around the far turn, but
failed to sustain his bid after being floated five wide entering the lane. ELVIRUS set the pace along the inside, but was headed turning for home, and
weakened in upper stretch. MY MAN FLINT was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
GYPSY TOUCH stalked along the inside, smoothly glided inside of the winner turning for home to bid for the lead at the quarter pole, forged an advantage
from that foe in upper stretch as DALIDA completed an outside bid, and held firm to the wire. DALIDA broke well, but was outsprinted early on to trail the
field, produced a stout rail surge to advance inside of foes in the early part of the turn, paused passing the five sixteenths pole while awaiting racing room
just behind the leaders, tipped three wide entering the lane for clear sailing as GYPSY TOUCH forged an advantage, then sustained her bid under a long
drive to threaten late, but was denied. WHISPERED KISS set the pace inside of a pair of foes while staying a path off of the rail around the turn, which
allowed for ample racing room for GYPSY TOUCH, met that foe's bid at the quarter pole, was headed in upper stretch, and yielded between rivals late.
STORMIN HOT broke many paths outwardly at the start, pressed the pace three wide while in the four path around the turn, but was outmoved by an inner
foe while failing to keep pace with the leaders entering the lane. MISS MCBRIDE tracked two wide, then four wide around the turn, came into the lane five
wide, and failed to factor. CARDIGAN vied for the lead two wide and between horses while in the three path into the turn, but weakened at the five
sixteenths pole. PERHAPS bobbled a bit at the start and raced off of the pace three wide early on, got caught five wide around the turn, and faded turning
for home.

Footnotes
RIGHT TRAPPE set the pace along the inside, vied inside of REMEMBRANCE around the far turn, but repelled that foe's bid at the furlong grounds, and
held sway thereafter. REMEMBRANCE pressed the pace setter around the first turn, vied around the far turn, but drifted slightly while hanging on her left
lead in upper stretch, and was repelled at the furlong grounds. I'M STYLIN saved ground off of the pace early on, commenced a four wide rally around the
far turn to vie for show in upper stretch, and achieved that position on the wire while chasing the leaders home. WENDY'S FINE WINE trailed early on,
advanced outside of foes into and down the backstretch to stalk the dueling pair around the far turn, but leveled off entering the lane, chased the leaders
evenly thereafter, but was nailed on the wire for show. TIZ PENNEY tracked from midpack along the inside, but lost position down the backstretch, steadied
between horses into the far turn, and failed to make an impact thereafter, then was vanned off. DARK PHOENIX dropped her rider and got loose pre-race,
then tracked the pace three wide, but was done early. WEEKEND GETAWAY got caught four wide around the first turn while off of the pace, and failed to
factor. FOX CREEK LADY tracked from midpack two wide, but was outmoved down the backstretch to trail the field in the five path into the far turn, and was
outrun.

Footnotes
TOP GUNNER dueled for the lead two wide, disposed of his inner counterpart at the quarter pole, widened his advantage in upper stretch, and was driven
home to safely hold sway from a rallying SOUNION. SOUNION gained ground four wide from off of the pace around the turn, sustained his rally to reach
place at the sixteenth pole, and minorly narrowed the gap on the clear leader late. BIG NICK stalked along the inside, advanced along the rail in upper
stretch to bid for place passing the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position at the sixteenth pole. JACK VAN BERG dueled for
the lead along the inside, but gave way turning for home, held place through upper stretch while shifting off of the rail, but faltered between horses at the
furlong grounds. NAME REJECTED chased the dueling leaders three wide while under urging into the turn, sustained chasing position entering the lane, but
was outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch, and failed to make an impact thereafter. THE FEATURE was bumped between horses at the start, inched
closer into the turn to track the leading duelers two wide and from between horses, but failed to produce a bid through the lane. ALL BODES WELL was
outrun.

Footnotes
STEPPER stalked four wide, vied two wide down the backstretch, cleared at the quarter pole, and widened under driving pressure. PERFECTIBLE LADY
gained ground in the five path around the far turn, then sustained the rally to reach place late. VIALETTO set the pace while feeling pressure from the
eventual winner down the backstretch, proved no match for that foe entering the lane, then lost place late. WAY TOO PRETTY stalked three wide, but only
managed to chase through the lane and failed to produce a bid. SEIVER broke slowly, saved ground at the rear of the field, and split horses in midstretch to
improve for a minor share. JOY IN THE BATTLE pressed two wide early on, stalked down the backstretch, but faded in upper stretch. BEE RIGHT settled at
the rear two wide around the first turn, and improved in the final furlong. GIDDY UP ZOEY saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room in the four
path at the five sixteenths pole, but failed to make an impact. RUNNINGONTHETAFUEL never got involved. ALL LUCK was done early.
