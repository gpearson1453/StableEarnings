two to three lengths to the front, chased three wide advancing through the latter portion of the turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
for home, took over command at the three-sixteenths and edged away to the finish kept to task. JAVA BUZZ brushed the near side stall at the start then got
nudged outwards by LABARDE into the inwards oncoming RED DANGER who got bumped in by pressure outside from MUNNY BOLT, got steadied when
bumped and pinched back between foes and conceded two lengths to the front, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, angled out
three to four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ADMIRAL HALSEY established the front and crossed to show the way in hand just off the
inside until tucked inside through the turn, cut the corner into upper stretch, got collared at the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. CASTLE
LEOCH got bumped by MUNNY BOLT, who broke inwards at the start and in turn bumped RED DANGER into JAVA BUZZ, chased just off the inside
behind the aforementioned foe, attempted to nudge and lean on MUNNY BOLT near the seven-sixteenths to get out from in behind ADMIRAL HALSEY and
was denied the move and forced to steady off the heels of that rival, remained just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. MUNNY BOLT broke in at the start under hustling bumping CASTLE LEOCH
into RED DANGER and in turn JAVA BUZZ into LABARDE while squeezing out a pair of foes and forcing a third in behind to steady, chased three wide and
was leaned on and nudged by CASTEL LEOCH nearing the seven-sixteenths in an attempt by that rival to get out from in behind the leader, held his lane
successfully denying the move before tucking to be just off the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LABARDE brushed the off side stall at the start, then got bumped by JAVA BUZZ due to pressure
outside begun by the inwards breaking MUNNY BOLT, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and
weakened. SNOW CANDY broke a half a beat slow and was steadied at the start when his lane got shut off directly in front and conceded three to four
lengths to the front, chased three then two wide, went four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
EXTRA EFFORT was hustled to the lead then came out some early, set the pace in the two path while under pressure to her outside, responded well when
asked turning into the stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, clung to the lead into the final sixteenth and held gamely under
strong urging. LEFT LEANING LUCY broke out a bit at the start then was corrected by the rider, pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the three
path early on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive then came under a right-handed crop, switched to a left-handed crop outside the eighth-pole,
fought on well while in pursuit of the winner, inched closer to that foe into the final sixteenth and just missed while narrowly able to hold the place. BUSTIN
BAY was hustled from the start, settled off the pace, was roused in the two path midway through the turn, swung four wide into the stretch under the crop,
rallied outside in the final furlong, closed well into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the show. ADDILYN hit the outside of the gate at the
break and was off a step slow, moved up under urging to establish a good position in the pocket, saved ground on the turn, was given her cue outside the
quarter-pole then put to a right-handed crop into upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. MEBS WEB was asked leaving the gate, settled on the outside
under some urging, came under stronger encouragement in the four path on the turn, was put to the crop outside the five-sixteenths then driven five wide
into the stretch and capitulated. STUNNING MUNNINGS dropped back soon after the start, was reserved at the rear of the field, saved ground on the turn,
was roused outside the five-sixteenths, moved off the inside under a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a right-handed crop at the
furlong marker and failed to respond.

backstretch, settled into a comfortable rhythm continuing under light coaxing, swung three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew clear under a
drive kept to task to the finish. THREE JOKERS forwardly placed just off the inside, came under encouragement at the three-eighths, angled four four wide

then dropped in from behind horses, chased along the rail under a drive, made a bid near the sixteenth-pole and got up under strong handling. GOTTA GO
MO showed good early speed, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure on the leader in the three path on the turn, was asked while carried
four wide into the stretch, took a slim advantage before the three-sixteenths, battled determinedly with multiple foes in the final furlong and was denied while
just able to get the place. RICHIES GREAT GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, moved up to take the lead, set the pace under pressure to her outside,
vied along the rail on the turn, was asked while spinning three wide for home, lost the lead near the three-sixteenths, fought on gamely to the wire and just
missed but narrowly held the show. TOO SEXY was coaxed along on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, was given her cue while five wide
into the stretch, chaed into the fianl furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed the trifecta. SECURE CONNECTION dropped back early then
settled near the rear, tugged at the bit while taken in hand behind a foe nearing the seven-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, swung seven wide into the
stretch then dropped inside of a foe, moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and gained but missed the minor awards. TASS was bumped on both sides at the
start then taken up while pinched back between horses, settled towards the rear, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path while roused,
dropped inward in upper stretch, came out into the final furlong, chased into the final sixteenth, steadied while blocked behind horses late and missed the
superfecta. TIPLE (IRE) broke a bit slow, settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused while two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the

advanced through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in dueling through the stretch taking slight
advantage a furlong out, then edged clear inside the final sixteenth to prevail. TIVOLI TWIRL showed the way in hand along the inside coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under threat dueling through the stretch getting collared a furlong out, fought on to
the sixteenth marker before being shaken off and ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. BLITZ TO WIN broke in at the start bumping KADEN
into ANEJO causing that pair of rivals to trade several bumps, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into
upper stretch and tired. LUCKY BRODY coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals. MY BROTHER NEIL coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside for home and never threatened. REUNION TOUR three then two wide through the first turn, chased
along the inside down the backstretch before tipping out three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
for home and made no impact. KADEN got bumped between foes at the start, then traded three minor bumps with ANEJO, went four then three wide
through the first turn, chased three to four wide just off the top pair, faded midway on the far turn, swung four wide for home, folded, and was eased to the

start, angled in while urged along just off the pace, shied out near the half-mile pole then dropped back into the turn, went four then three wide on that bend,

Footnotes
JORDAN'S LEO just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under light coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down spinning just off the inside for
home, took over command at the head of the stretch and edged clear under a drive to prevail. TOWN AVENGER just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out four to five wide for home and closed well outside latching on the aforementioned foe as she hit the
finish. MAGISTERIUM (IRE) broke in a step at the start bumping MISS DELICIOUS, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home and ran on to secure the show honors. EARTH STRIKE (IRE) saved ground at the tail of the field, came under a ride at the
three-eighths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. ISLAND TREASURE saved ground in pursuit from mid pack,
came under coaxing three furlongs from home, took the inside route into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish but was outfinished in the late stages.
LISHEEN saved ground near the rear of the field, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and improved
position by mostly tired rivals. COMMUNITY ADJUSTED struck the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside from near the rear, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and made no impact. ALYDIVA two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MISS DELICIOUS struck the near side stall at the start, established the front shortly
after the start and showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded

Footnotes
TRINNI LUCK angled in while going to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was put to light urging at the
five-sixteenths, responded well when asked for her best in upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under
steady urging. HONEY MONEY stumbled at the start but recovered quickly, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn,
chased into the stretch then was put to a right-handed crop around the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved
no match while able to hold the place. BETSY BLUE was carried in early, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the turn, moved out under a
left-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a right-handed crop late and missed the place while well clear for the show. DIVA BANKER was carried in
early, established a good position in the middle of the field, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted out while
dropping back into the final furlong and weakened. FIGHT ON LUCY broke out and brushed with a foe, was carried in early then forced in behind the rail
leaving the chute, checked when headed directly for the fence while behind the large tree on the pan-camera view, moved out to clear that rail then settled
at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the whip and failed to rally. MY ROXY GIRL pressed the pace on the
outside of the winner, was urged along in the two path on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and faltered then was eased late but walked off.
AWILLAWAY broke out then was taken up, spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn, drifted in outside the
furlong marker and also faltered then was eased late but walked off.

just off the inside through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and closed outside but was staved off to the wire. INTO THE SUNRISE broke out at
the start bumping FAUCI into SKY'S NOT FALLING, chased along the inside early on before tipping to the two path, went four then three wide into upper
stretch, dug in latched on knocking heads with ARREST ME RED until shaken off a sixteenth out and was along clear for the show honors. MOMOS coaxed
from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside for home, yielded the front at the three-sixteenths and
weakened in the late stages. SKY'S NOT FALLING got brushed at the start by FAUCI due to pressure from INTO THE SUNRISE breaking outwards,

Footnotes
CLEVER FELLOW settled on the inside, was given his cue on the final turn, moved to the two path inside the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead into upper
stretch then kicked clear and held under strong urging. VIKING ZIM moved in while keen under restraint early, went three wide on the opening bend, was
reserved off the pace, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed with good courage but failed to reach
the winner while clear for the place. ARROWHEART saved ground on the first turn, was reserved near the middle of the field, came under urging on the far
turn, cut the corner into the stretch under the crop, moved to the two path before the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while up for the show.
GHOSTMON established a forward position early, rounded the first turn in the two path, followed the solo leader from second, was asked while two then
three wide on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and tired. BREW PUB bobbled slightly at the start, saved ground on the opening bend, was reserved
near the back, traveled in the two path while roused on the far turn, shifted three wide into the stretch then moved further out and improved position. COX'S
LEDGE brushed the gate at the start then was hustled, moved in while taken in hand early, tucked into the two path entering the first turn, settled towards
the front on the backstretch, was asked while three wide on the final turn and came up empty. STRAIGHT SKINNY was taken in hand early then reserved at
the back on the inside, saved ground through the far turn and failed to threaten. FLINTSHIRE'S ROCK went to the front, set the clear pace on the inside,
was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and capitulated. ADDICTED TO YOU hit the outside of the gate at
the start but broke with the field, went three wide on the first turn, settled outside without cover, was roused three wide on the far turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to respond. LOULOVESTHERIVER went two to three wide on the turns, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and was no factor.
FEYDERSPIEL came out into the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was reserved on the outside, went four wide under urging on the far turn and
showed little.
