Footnotes
BEE HOUSE settled off the pace and the inside, began a steady three wide advance just before a half, roused into the lane, took over on the outside past
the furlong marker, drove clear. POINT OF VICTORY broke well, narrowly set the pace inside, continued to show the way turn, was putting away the other
speed nearing midstretch just as the winner was challenging on the outside, proved no match for that one, clearly second best while wrapped up in the final
strides. CYBER SNEAKER forwardly placed off the inside, tried the runner up through the turn, weakened the final furlong. MY LITTLE GUERA pressed the
runner up from off the inside the opening quarter, began to weaken early in the turn. AMIRITE last to leave, was never dangerous. BEAR THE MOMENT
settled off the pace, lacked a closing response. HERE COMES JUANITA remained back in showing little.

Footnotes
CRIMSON FELINE closest to the two leaders early inside, continued to pursue that pair in the run up the backstretch, began to move closer midway on the
second bend, steered out three wide into the lane, collared the leader in midstretch and edged clear under steady handling. SUCRE chased the leader,
moved to engage that one in the second turn, dueled, shook briefly clear into the stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner a furlong out then could not
match strides. MISS NEKO back off the pace, roused three wide into the lane, lodged a belated rally to be clear for the show, slowly getting to the runner up.
KODIAK SKY void of speed, came four wide out of the final turn, improved position with some mild late interest. QUEEN OF CARNIVAL settled off the pace,
continued in mid pack the middle half mile, lacked a closing response in the drive. SAY YES AGAIN broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, faltered
when headed by the runner up late in the final turn. PRETTI SAVI finished after a half.

Footnotes
MOORAC in the second flight for three furlongs off the inside, roused three wide into the lane, late bid while widest of the first flight at the wire, best. MISS
INVADER void of speed, tipped out a bit to rally from between rivals into the lane, challenged late inside the winner and once again between foes, outkicked
in the waning strides. LOUISIANA'S HOPE with the early pace in the three path and widest, edged clear turning for home, continued to hold the advantage
past the furlong marker, could not contain the top two at the wire. MISSBUDLITELIME bothered slightly start, set or forced the pace between rivals the
opening quarter, chased the leader into the lane and gradually weakened closest to the inside. ENVOYS LEGACY broke out and a bit slowly to be last
away, void of speed in trailing for three furlongs, came five wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a threat. LITTLE TATOR TOT
flashed brief speed along the inside, was finished before three furlongs. ARANCIA in the second flight in the run up the backstretch outside, steadily
retreated.

Footnotes
QUINN ELLA last away, unhurried, continued to lag while entrymate set a moderate pace, picked up the tempo late in the final turn, rallied four wide into the
lane, finished full of run down the center of the course to win going away. GLANCE shuffled back soon after the start in tight quarter, lodged an early move
into a forward position before a half, challenged in the second turn, shook clear and held a sizable advantage past the furlong marker, proved no match for
the winner late, remained clear for the place. RUBY SIOUX in mid pack while in some traffic early, pulled in the run up the backstretch, closer three wide
late in the final turn, failed to sustain that advance in the drive, narrowly saved the show. BAR TAP lacked early foot, came in the two path and in some
traffic into the straight, split foes past the furlong marker when rallying mildly, outkicked late for the show spot. AMELIA MADELYN prompted the pace while
saving ground, remained within striking distance final turn, had little left for the stretch run. HERO OF GOLD forwardly placed for five furlongs, gave way in
the second turn. KRIS T. broke in good order, set most all of the pace inside, gave way into the lane as his winning entrymate was rallying.

Footnotes
ELIZABETH RENEE last away, void of early foot, began a steady advance four wide early in the turn, came three wide when within striking distance into the
stretch, outside bid past the furlong marker and drew well clear while kept to pressure. LIGHT AS A WHISPER broke on top, chased the leader up the
backstretch racing just off the inside, closer through the turn, took over upper stretch, proved no match for the winner soon after, narrowly held the place.
PADIOLI sprinted clear out of the chute, continued to show the way by daylight early in the turn, responded when the runner up came alongside entering the
stretch, also proved no match for the winner while giving ground grudgingly for the place. TOSHITA FOREVER raced in mid pack off the inside, continued
evenly through the lane in lacking a late punch. MSCHITCHATTOUR fell back to trail before leaving the chute, continued back up the backstretch and into
the turn, four wide exiting the bend, exhibited some late interest to improve position. BLAMEITONTHEJOCK lacked speed, failed to muster a rally when
called on for the drive. E Z BREEZ in the second flight for a half, steadily faded. RICH DREAMS within striking distance early outside, staged a steady
retreat.

Footnotes
JUSTA SWINGING in the second flight while off the inside, crept closer in the three path late in the final, saw that progress stall in upper straight, roused,
outside bid, wore down foe late. CPRIORITY dueled into the first turn, closest to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, briefly clear after a half,
headed far turn, regained nearing midstretch, proved stubborn to the end in relinquishing the advantage to the winner. WE NEED A FIVE settled in the
second group inside the winner, continued one paced through the second turn, lacked a significant response in the drive to finish up best of the rest.
PERMANENTDETENTION dueled early outside the runnerup, chased that one up the backstretch, put a head in front in the second turn, narrowly showed
the way into the lane then weakened from between the top two the final furlong. K T'S JILTED GROOM raced in mid pack and turned in an even effort
throughout in lacking a closing response. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST last away, lacked speed, improved position without posing a serious threat. BITSY'S
OTHER HALF remained back throughout in lacking a closing response. IMA SUNNY SONG raced in the main body for six furlongs and had nothing left late.
RACE FOR DADDY raced wide into the first turn, finished early, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field in the stretch, jogged in. OPENING
QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SECRET VISTA allowed the pace to go early, moved closer in some traffic far turn while toward the inside, tipped out three wide turning for home, bid, long
drive, drifted in a bit late, fully extended to prevail. UNFATHOMED forwardly placed from the start, chased the leader up the backstretch, advanced on that
one second turn, put a head in front late in that bend, responded when confronted by the winner upper stretch, bothered slightly when that one drifted in
despite a busy left handed crop late, proved stubborn to the end. WISE GUY took command along the inside, showed the way up the backstretch while
continuing to save ground, headed second turn, switched out when behind the top two inside the furlong marker, coming back on that pair while widest of
the first flight at the wire. CALLTHEWOLFE lacked speed, moved a bit closer while three wide through the second turn, failed to sustain that mild advance in
the drive. THE THIMBLE failed to menace while remaining back. ROCK ON COWBOY pressed the issue early off the inside, fell back before a half and was
finished to trail home. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF UNFATHOMED AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER
MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
PRETTY CREATIVE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside when clear, continued to show the way the middle half, responded when confronted for the
drive, held a narrow advantage a furlong out, headed late, drifted out slightly to help tighten up VENN in the final strides, battled back in game fashion to
regain the advantage at the wire in a game effort. DREWPOWER settled off the pace and the inside, patiently handled while within striking distance up the
backstretch, closer turning for home, challenged on the outside with a furlong remaining, put a head in front late while lugging in forcing VENN to check up
in the final strides, outfinished at the wire. VENN closest to the leader, moved closer turning for home, challenged between foes nearing midstretch, was put
in tight quarters late and was forced to check up late to lose all chance. OLD SOT last away, trailed early inside, continued to save ground when moving
slightly closer turning for home, failed to sustain that mild advance through the stretch. THE BIG IRISHMAN lacked speed, failed to muster a rally.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF VENN AGAINST BOTH PRETTY CREATIVE AND DREWPOWER
FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE FORMER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND AND THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED AND
PLACED THIRD. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MUCHO MARVIN outrun in the early going while three wide, roused four wide when steered out slightly to be four wide into the lane, closed with good
resolve to be up in the final stride. VICTORY TRIP broke sharp, set the pace off the inside, clear a furlong out, nipped late while holding the place.
WAYFARING STRANGER settled off the pace, saved ground into the lane, staged a mild rally while slowly gaining in the late going. BOSTON REPO
chased the leader in the three path, weakened the final furlong. HOMEVIEW saved ground to no avail in lacking a closing kick. ROSE'S GALAXY off a step
slow, trailed, remained back. KENSLEY'S HIPPIE within striking distance outside, five wide turning for home, faded.
