Footnotes
GAMBLER'S FALLACY was off a step slow, then was settled back and raced three to four wide on the backstretch, advanced on the far turn and came four
wide into the drive, closed well to get up in time under a drive. EGO was well rated early and made a three wide bid on the far turn to gain command
approaching the furlong marker, then drifted in slightly in deep stretch and was caught late. CANDY STORE was in tight a bit on the first turn, was reserved
two wide down the backstretch, worked his way to the outside on the turn and came five wide into the drive and rallied well late. OUTLIER was with the pace
two to three wide, made a bid to take command on the far turn two wide, then fought gamely in the furlong grounds, took up in deep stretch while fading.
CABERTOSS set the early pace while crossing over to the inside under a strong hold, then vied for command on the backstretch, then faded in the drive
while saving ground throughout. UPHOLD chased the early pace two wide, angled out in mid stretch but lacked the needed winning bid. THE STEWARDS
POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN CONCERNING THE STRECH RUN, ALSO THE JOCKEY ON #6 OUTLIER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE #4 EGO FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, AFTER REVIEWING THE REPLAYS THE STEWARDS LEFT THE RACE AS IS

Footnotes
GAME BOY BENNY stalked the early pace three wide, then made a two to three wide bid on the turn, then came three wide into the drive and wore down
the pace setter late to prove best under a drive. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND set the early pace on the inside while clear, then dug in gamely in the stretch but
was caught late to just miss. NAUGHTY ALFRED bobbled at the start spotting the field three or four lengths, then advanced three to four wide on the turn to
loom boldly, but hung in the drive. ROYAL COMMISSION was allowed to settle early towards the inside, moved out on the turn, came five wide into the
drive and offered a mild late rally. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, swung off the rail when leaving the turn but
lacked the needed kick. ORO DE TEJANO was allowed to settle early moved towards the inside and was three wide by the quarter pole but offered no rally.

Footnotes
ROCKY RUSH was away alertly and crossed over to set the pace on the inside, was well handled and dawdled along on the front end, then was sent down
leaving the far turn and held on gamely after a long drive. SUBDUED prompted the pace three wide early, made a two to three wide bid leaving the five
sixteenths pole, went on even terms by the furlong marker and was outfinished after a long drive to just miss. ZACAPA RUN was off a step slow, then was
settled three wide on the backstretch, then advanced and came into the drive four wide, rallied well late. MARV'S MAGIC was in tight on the inside and had
to check nearing the first turn, then was reserved early, came five wide into the stretch and had a belated rally. ZANESVILLE was well rated early and raced
on the inside on the far turn, swung out three wide for the drive but lacked the needed winning punch. STEWARDS RULES tracked the early pace and
made a three wide bid on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. BLESSED WITH LUCK was well placed early on the inside and stopped, then was
eased and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUTHERN SMILE was five wide into the first turn, then was settled five wide on the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the turn, then hit the front leaving
the turn and moved over to the inside and drew off to prove much the best under a hand urging. E STREET ANGEL set the early pace on the inside and
was keen and went on to open up a bid advantage on the backstretch, then was headed by the winner leaving the turn and proved to be no match for that
rival while clearly second best. SAVEDBESTFORLAST was four wide on the first turn, then was rated four wide down the backstretch, made a three wide
bid with the winner on the turn but came up empty in the drive. PEEKACHICA was reserved early on the inside, then moved out on the turn and came four
wide into the drive to pass the tiring rivals. QUICK AND EASY chased the early pace on the inside then weakened. EMILY LANE was bumped at the start,
then was reserved three wide early, came five wide into the drive, failed to menace.

Footnotes
BANDIDO DE AMORES was well rated early while three to four wide on the turn, swung out six wide leaving the turn and closed well on the outside to win
going away late under a drive. DILETTANTE stalked the early pace three wide, made a three wide bid between rivals on the turn, shook clear nearing the
furlong marker, but could not go with the winner late while staying on gamely for the place award. ROCK N JUNE BUG stalked the early pace and made a
four wide bid on the far turn while in between horses but flattened out and was outfinished for the place award. B TROUBLE set a pressured pace on the
inside then weakened in the drive. POLAR WIND was well rated early towards the inside, swung out four wide for the drive to have a belated rally.
THATSWHATITHOUGHT stalked the early pace and made a five wide bid on the turn but weakened. RARE FORM pressed the early pace in between
horses and weakened.

Footnotes
RAPA NUI stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid leaving the turn to shake clear by the furlong marker, then held sway late to prove best under a
drive. PRESTO BENCH was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn and was gaining late. SHA KON O HEY was four wide into the first
turn, then was reserved on the backstretch, made a three wide move on the far turn, continued that move into the stretch, angled in by the furlong marker
but hung late. WHITE SILVER SANDS was rated along early, then advanced on the inside on the far turn, remained on the inside and was blocked and had
to check hard by the furlong marker losing all chance, faded. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY was void of early speed, then came five wide into the drive while
advancing, then lugged in badly in the stretch while offering a belated rally. HENRY RULES set the pace on the inside and gave way in the drive.
PALMER'S PASS lacked a solid rally. BIG EARL chased the early pace and weakened. PUNKSTER chased the early pace four wide and tired.
