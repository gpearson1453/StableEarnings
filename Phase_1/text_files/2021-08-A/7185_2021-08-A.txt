KNIGHT'S CROSS sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held that margin without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. IN
IT TO WIN rated back early, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch, angled out, then was no threat to the winner, while clearly
best of the rest. ENGLISH LAUGHTER tracked the pace, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the stretch, then could
not gain and held the show. THE SINNER IS YOU allowed to settle, looped three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch and

Footnotes
BANDY'S MAP allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, closed fast
and edged up in the final strides. STARSHIP EMPIRE well placed and inside, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, bid three wide into the
lane, made a steady gain, led late, then was outfinished. CLAW stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the second turn, bid
outside the leader into the stretch, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then weakened and held the show. GENERALONAMISSION sprinted to a clear
lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share. MISSION BRIEF allowed to settle, looped to
position four wide through the second turn, bid five wide into the lane and evened out. JINGLE BELLS tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. LONG TOM improved position. JUST PLUNGE allowed to settle, moved up
inside through the second turn, came through inside and had no stretch rally. MONTRICHARD well placed and three wide, faded through the second turn.
SPLIT MY BRITCHES was a brief factor.
