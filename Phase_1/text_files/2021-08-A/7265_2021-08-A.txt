Footnotes
SHAKER SHACK broke out but was quickly corrected by the rider, set the pace under pressure to the outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked for
more outside the quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch then shook clear while moving further out, had the rider take a confident peak behind him to
the outside near the furlong marker, drifted in closer to the runner-up when the rider noticed that foe coming through along the rail at the sixteenth-pole and
held under good handling. CHLOE ROSE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along just off the pace, drafted behind foes in the two path on the turn,
came out into the stretch then bumped with BRIELLA and paused behind foes, altered to the inside for room at the three-sixteenths, chased under a
right-handed crop, made an inside bid into the final sixteenth but missed while clear for the place. SPUN D'ETAT broke out at the start, was urged along just
off the pace, chased three then four wide on the turn, pursued the winner in the stretch and was out-kicked while just able to get the show. SEASCAPE
broke out and bumped with an opponent, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path on the turn, was carried four wide into the
stretch then moved further out, pursued the winner into the final furlong and was outfinished then just missed the show. BRIELLA chased the pace on the
outside then three wide on the turn, was carried five wide into the stretch then bumped with CHLOE ROSE, dropped back while crowded at that point and
came up empty. CALIBOGUE SOUND was urged along on the inside, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved to the two path at the three-eighths
then the three path around the five-sixteenths, was driven six wide into the stretch, drifted in near the furlong marker and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MCKULICK (GB) just off the inside through the first turn, settled three then two wide in mid pack rating kindly, remained patiently handled just off the inside
through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a good kick to charge
along the outside overhauling the leader near the sixteenth marker, then edged away to the finish. CONSUMER SPENDING just off the inside through the
opening bend, settled three then two wide at the tail of the field, tucked to the inside with seven-sixteenths to go and saved ground through the far turn
under patient handling until roused angled out to spin five wide into upper stretch following her barn and stable mate, closed well through to the finish to
secure the place honors inside the final sixteenth and was wrapped up in the final jumps. FROSTED OATS brushed the near side stall at the start, raced
eager and pulling while under the restraint by the rider early on before heading three then two wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide in closest
aim of the duel up front, commenced a steady advance three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing when latching on the top pair near the quarter
pole, went four wide into upper stretch, lugged in straightened away when seizing command near the three-sixteenths forcing SKYLERVILLE to briefly
pause in the two path and leaving LOVE TO RUN unscathed along the rail, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was overhauled near the
sixteenth marker, then ran on to preserve the show honors. PENNY SAVER broke a beat slow and hopped at the start conceding four lengths before
settling into stride, chased just off the inside from near the rear coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to
miss for the show honors. SKYLERVILLE a bit keen early on pulling on the bit against the rider's rating hold, dueled from the two path with LOVE TO RUN
to her inside, came under coaxing continuing to knock heads at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, got forced to pause briefly when FROSTED
OATS lugged in at the three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. LOVE TO RUN coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of the aforementioned foe getting
set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened to the wire. ANILEATE coaxed from the
start, tracked the pace along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered two to three wide into upper stretch and tired. TAHAWEEL two to
three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under encouragement at the three-eighths, angled five wide at the head of the stretch and made
no impact.

KREESA LA WROTE settled off the pace, moved from two to three wide early on the turn, shifted four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside into the
final furlong, switched back to her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well to get up late. U SHOULD B DANCING was bumped in the
hindquarters at the start, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped to the rail, was put to a right-handed
crop after turning into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker, led determinedly into the final sixteenth, drifted out again late then came out more
abruptly, had the rider stand up in the saddle and take a look behind him to make sure he had safe clearance in front of a beaten CAUMSETT then was
denied on the wire. CAUMSETT was well placed just off the pace on the inside, moved to the two path under urging late on the turn, gained to make a bid
inside the three-sixteenths then was carried out more, battled with the winner into the final sixteenth, had her path taken while being outfinished late and
secured the show. NO PAYNE broke a step slow, settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. ISLE
STORM moved in while chasing the pace on the outside, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. MISS
FLINTSHIRE broke a bit slow then stumbled after the start, dropped well back, moved from the two path to the rail on the turn and was no factor.
FAVORITE IMPULSE had her head turned and was unprepared for the start then off slow, spotted the front several lengths, saved ground on the turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. CATCHULADY broke a bit slow then bumped with a rival and was taken up, went three then
four wide on the turn and failed to respond. BARREL OF BLISS pressed the pace on the outside of the runner-up, vied in the four path for most of the turn,
bolted to near the outside fence approaching the quarter-pole and dropped out. FOLLOWING THE RACE, THE RIDER OF CAUMSETT CLAIMED FOUL
AGAINST U SHOULD B DANCING ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. THERE WAS ALSO A STEWARDS' INQUIRY. AFTER THE
STEWARDS' REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH

Footnotes
EASY TO BLESS bobbled at the break and recovered to be five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from just off the pace, tucked
four then three wide through the turn steadily advancing on the top pair and getting put to coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper
stretch, got nudged in behind by MIDTOWN ROSE due to pressure from HARPER'S IN CHARGE coming out slightly when taking command at the
three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive kept to task. MIDTOWN ROSE coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace four then three wide down the
backstretch before advancing three then two wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home between foes and got
nudged by HARPER'S IN CHARGE coming out slightly and in turn bumped EASY TO BLESS lightly in behind, dug in under a drive running on to chase the
winner home while safe for the place honors. AWESOME INDRA brushed the off side stall at the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) stumbled at the start, chased along
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals. OFF WE GO coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, had HARPER'S IN CHARGE drift in at the eighth pole and was steadied and altered out to the two
then three path inside that station and re-roused but weakened to the finish. HARPER'S IN CHARGE broke out at the start and was corrected, showed the
way lightly coaxed along three then two wide under pressure from MIDTOWN ROSE to the outside, got joined by the eventual winner three deep through
the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the inside for home and came outwards nudging MIDTOWN ROSE into EASY TO BLESS when yielding command
at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive backing away and drifted in sealing off the lane of OFF WE GO along the rail at the eighth pole forcing that rival
to steady and alter out, then continued to weakened to the wire. There was an Objection lodged by the trainer of MIDTOWN ROSE alleging interference in
the stretch against EASY TO BLESS as well as a Stewards' Inquiry into the matter. After review, the objection was dismissed and result stood prior to the
race being declared official.

Footnotes
MASKED MARAUDER settled on the outside, brushed with a foe leaving the backstretch, was roused five wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper
stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker and prevailed under strong urging. BABAGRAM was hustled from the start, chased the
pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, turned into upper stretch under a strong drive, made a bid outside the eighth-pole, battled
with the winner in the final furlong and was outfinished but determinedly earned the place. SONIC SPEED broke out at the start, settled towards the rear,
bumped with I'M BLAMING YOU leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and improved
position to narrowly garner the show. FORGOTTEN MISSION was hustled to the lead, showed the way near the inside, departed the backstretch under a
snug left-handed grip while briefly spinning off the rail, extended the advantage while inside on the turn, was set down into upper stretch, lost the advantage
to the winner approaching the furlong marker and was out-kicked. BOOM BOOM KABOOM settled on the outside under some urging, came under stronger
encouragement in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased to the finish and was out-kicked. MAJESTIC TIGER was coaxed
along on the inside, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. TEMPESTA broke out
and bumped with a foe then was pinched back between horses, settled near the back, saved ground on the turn and also lacked the needed response. I'M
BLAMING YOU had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was carried out at the start, angled out in the back half of the field, bumped with SONIC SPEED
leaving the backstretch while brushing with another foe, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. DISTRACTANDATTACK bumped with an
opponent at the start, was forwardly placed on the outside, went three wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened. CHASE THE CAT
was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, went around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch, moved further out
in the drive and trailed.

DREAM LITH broke in at the start and continued to come inwards forcing both FABULOUS FANNY and SHANGHAI SHAMROCK to steady when pinched
out between foes just after the start, chased four then three wide just off the pace, tucked inwards and forced SHE'S BRILLIANT to steady when put in tight
and then pinched out between rivals nearing the half mile pole, rode the two path through the turn floating nearly three wide at the three-eighths when
placed to coaxing, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes to take command nearing the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive kept
busy to the wire. MOMMASGOTTARUN established the front under coaxing from the gate and crossed to show the way just off the inside in hand down the
backstretch in the early stages, got joined nearing the half mile pole by the rank and pulling POPULAR VOTE and tucked inside into the turn, dueled through
the bend with that rival to her outside, spun just off the inside for home shaking off that foe confronted by a pair, dug in and yielded the front near the eighth
pole, ran on willingly to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. FABULOUS FANNY brushed the near side stall at the start
when leaning inwards, then got brushed between foes and was forced to steady out in tandem with SHANGHAI SHAMROCK after the start as DREAM LITH
continued to come over to the inside and conceded three lengths of position before settling back into stride to advance once more nearing the half mile pole,
bid through the turn to be just off the duel four then three wide, swung five wide into upper stretch prominent to the top pair to the outside straightened away,
got shaken off inside the final furlong and was along to preserve the show in a good effort. FREE CHICKENS chased along the inside from just off the pace
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two then three wide into upper stretch nudging the shying away POPULAR VOTE, tipped out at the
three-sixteenths three paths and weakened. SHE'S BRILLIANT three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got forced to steady when put in tight and then pinched
out between foes nearing the half mile pole as DREAM LITH tucked inside from the four path, tucked to the two path through the turn coaxed along from the
five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. AMANI'S IMAGE two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened. SHANGHAI SHAMROCK got steadied when bumped between foes and pinched out just
after the start conceding three lengths of position before settling into stride, chased five to six wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through
the turn striding greenly and facing some kickback early on, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. POPULAR VOTE stumbled
awkwardly at the start to the left side nearly popping the rider from the irons in an almost propping move conceding four to five lengths to the front, chased
briefly inside growing rank and tossing her head with five and a half furlongs remaining before being darted to the outside by the rider and given some rein
to work with, advanced quickly outside rivals to engage the leader half a mile from home, dueled tucked to the two path through the turn with
MOMMASGOTTARUN to her inside, got shaken off just inside the quarter pole and spun three then four wide into upper stretch when nudged by FREE
CHICKENS again tossing her head rank when the rider took hold and shying out a path and steadily backed away to the finish.

Footnotes
REGAL GLORY went three wide on the first turn, was reserved under tight restraint on the outside, raced three then four wide while still in reserve on the far
turn, was roused six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a left-handed crop into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. HENDY WOODS
was rated kindly in the second flight while saving ground, moved to the two path while ranging up at the five-sixteenths, pursued the leader three wide into
the stretch, made an outside bid coming to the furlong marker, took a narrow advantage outside the sixteenth-pole but was caught while able to get the
place. SHIFTY SHE went to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, came out a path onto the backstretch then dropped back in, showed the
way through reasonable fractions, vied inside on the far turn, was given her cue just inside the five-sixteenths, spun into the two path entering the stretch,
came under a right-handed crop under heavy threat from the runner-up outside the furlong marker, was headed by that foe outside the sixteenth-pole and
outfinished while able to secure the show. VIADERA (GB) was reserved under stout restraint while saving ground, moved to the two path late on the final
turn, steadied while blocked behind a trio of horses at the three-sixteenths then altered course to the outside and finished willingly for the last spot in the
superfecta. RAVEN'S CRY (IRE) showed early speed between foes, became rank when taken back between horses nearing the first turn, rounded that
bend in the two path, was rated outside in the second flight, went three then four wide while let out on the final turn, cornered five wide for home, dropped
back while remaining on her inside lead into the final furlong and came up empty. STAR COMMAND navigated the first turn in the two path, was reserved
towards the back, saved ground on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came three wide into the stretch under the crop and lacked the
needed response. BELLE LAURA went three wide on the opening bend, tracked the pace on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch,
dropped back two then three wide on the far turn, floated five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

in the late stages. MICROBIOME broke on top and showed the way early on before being displaced by the eventual winner a furlong after the start,

Footnotes
CON LIMA strolled to the front, was well rated while setting an uncontested pace in the two path, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came
under a strong hand ride, was put to a right-handed crop nearing the furlong marker and held under strong urging. HIGHER TRUTH (IRE) was taken in hand
early then rated on the inside, came under urging nearing the quarter-pole then moved to the two path into the stretch, tipped out more while chasing the
leader at the eighth-pole and brushed with a foe, continued her relentless pursuit of the winner to the wire and missed but finished with good courage for the
place. CREATIVE FLAIR (IRE) was taken back early then angled to the rail, saved ground while reserved off the pace, was asked approaching the
quarter-pole then swung four wide into upper stretch, chased the winner to the wire and finished willingly for the show. PLUM ALI was taken in hand early
then reserved in the two path, swung five wide into upper stretch, was carried out into the final furlong and improved position. GAM'S MISSION was taken in
hand early, tracked the pace on the outside in the three path, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner into upper stretch, was brushed by
the runner-up and carried out a bit into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead shortly thereafter and weakened. OUT OF SORTS was taken back
early then moved in, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the
stretch then dropped in around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. MESSIDOR (IRE) was reserved off the pace in the two path, came
under urging on the far turn, was carried six wide into upper stretch and came up empty. ROCKY SKY (IRE) was reserved on the outside while three to four
wide, swung seven wide into upper stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
DANZIGWITHTHESTARS bumped at the start by ALBIE due to pressure from THE GOLDEN DOOR breaking inwards, chased three wide from afar among
the main body of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong
taking command a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish to prevail. CATCH THAT PARTY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide for home, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole overhauling the used up leader, dug in and was collared a
sixteenth from home, ran on willingly and clear for the place honors. ALBIE got bumped at the start by THE GOLDEN DOOR and in turn bumped
DANZIGWITHTHESTARS, got steadied along the rail and pinched out seven furlongs from home, tracked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path
through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went five wide for home and offered up a mild kick. SARATOGA FLASH got steadied
between rivals when STANHOPE tucked directly in front with seven and a half furlongs remaining, went three then two wide through the first turn before
tucking to the inside nearing the backstretch, saved ground from that point on until coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and tipping out to swing five
wide for home, then stayed on one paced to the finish. THE GOLDEN DOOR broke in at the start bumping ALBIE into DANZIGWITHTHESTARS, chased
just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. STANHOPE coaxed from the gate, spurted
away on the lead just off the inside pulling on the bit against the hold of the rider and widening away down the backstretch to a commanding advantage,
tucked inside through the turn, spun just off the inside for home with the field quickly taking closer order, dug in under a drive and was overhauled just inside
the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. PERPETRATE three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, spun three wide into
upper stretch and made no impact. MR. VINCENT chased just off the inside under encouragement from the three-eighths, went four wide at the head of the
stretch and made no headway. RIFT VALLEY chased along the inside under urging from midway on the far turn, cornered just off the inside into upper
stretch and made no impact. CHROME DIXIE four then three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide coming under a ride at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and folded.
