Footnotes
EMMYS SILVER was in just a hair tight after the break, recovered to track the leaders inside, steadied just slightly past the three-sixteenths looking for
room, found it in the stretch while making a bid up the rail, took over inside the final sixteenth and was clear to the wire. ZENFULLY ZESTY bumped a rival
at the start, attended the early pace, went four wide on the turn, was kept busy in the lane to secure the place. QUETZALCOATL was urged at the break,
set a pressured pace inside rivals but in the two path, weakened in late stretch. MAJORWAYHOME broke awkwardly, began to advance in the two path on
the turn and continued to gain mildly but steadily in the lane. RIGGED RIGHT was bumped inward at the start, urged forward at the break after coming in,
was within range three wide and between rivals on the turn but weakened in the stretch. RIGLET exchanged a bump at the start, switched out heading up
the backstretch, chased outside rivals five wide on the turn and came up empty. CHARLIES HURRICANE was urged at the break but outsprinted, shifted in
late up the backstretch to go in the four path on the turn, failed to rally. DYNASTY SMOKE exchanged a bump at the start and was forced to alter out,
lacked early speed racing off the inside, went in the four to five path on the turn and was not a threat. RUN LIKE THE WIND broke on top and was among
the early leaders but soon started getting out badly late up the backstretch and all the way to the outer rail on the turn, was eased in the stretch and walked
off. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

QUIEN ES switched out clearing the gap, went four to five wide on the turn commencing a bid, struck the lead in upper stretch and held while being kept to
the task. SILENT ZENON prompted the pace from outside rivals, went three wide on the turn, kept on well in the lane to be second best. SOUTHERN FIRE
was forwardly-positioned between runners into the turn going two wide on that bend, could not kick on with the top pair but captured show honors. ZAPPED
was forwardly-placed inside, contended through the turn, yielded in the lane. CHAMPITO switched out racing through the gap, went five wide into the turn
moving in a path on that bend and was asked for more by the quarter pole but could only run on evenly. HUNKA BULL trailed racing off the inside, moved in
from the six to the four path on the turn and was never able to menace.

Footnotes
MY CRAZY SISTER was bumped at the break, moved forward inside foes but off the fence, contended for the lead in the two path on the turn, took over
turning for home and drew clear. LAUGHING ROCKETT prompted the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, was no match but second best.
ATTACKING GIRL was forwardly-positioned between runners, went three wide on the turn dropping back at the quarter pole, swung six wide turning for
home and kept on to capture show honors. TEE SHOT DOLLY exchanged a bump and stumbled at the start, switched out and moved forward up the
backstretch, dropped back five then four wide on the turn and came up empty. STORM N GOLD steadied slightly after the start, saved ground on the turn
but did not threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SMOOTH BLUES pressed the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn taking command leaving that bend, drew away under steady handling. POOF
HE'S GONE was pressed by the aforementioned racing in the two path, proved no match but secured the place. IT'S OVER DUDE broke a half-step slowly,
switched outside and chased the leading pair from outside going four wide on the turn, was no match for those two. TAB ME OUT saved ground but failed to
rally. SQUALLSGHOSTMOVER got away alertly, pursued the leaders mid-pack, moved out from three to five wide on the turn, failed to rally. WILD
FIREWATER hopped ever so slightly at the break, raced between foes three wide into the turn shifting five wide out of that bend, was not a threat. INDY'S
CHINOOK did not threaten while racing inside on the turn. BLUES TOWN TOO bobbled just slightly at the start, failed to menace going five wide on the
turn.

Footnotes
SUNSCREEN switched off the inside early, tracked from the three path, lacked room at the top of the stretch but split rivals in mid-stretch to take a narrow
lead and prevail. OFFENSIVE settled off the leaders, saved ground on the inside through both turns, bid along the rail in mid-stretch but was outfinished.
SURPRSINGLYPERFECT settled last but one racing off the inside in about the three to four path early, moved out from two to four wide on the far turn
swinging seven deep into upper stretch, rallied to get up for show. VROYSKY was fractious in the gate, bobbled at the break but recovered to move clear,
set the pace in the two path, weakened in the lane. MANOSO was bumped at the break, stalked the leader from outside into the first turn then applied
pressure up the backstretch, went three to four wide throughout and weakened. WILMAS IRISH ROVER moved forward outside rivals heading up the
backstretch having gone four to five wide on the first turn, encouraged along four deep on the far turn but came up empty. MR. WILD ROCKETE was
outside a rival well back at the rear four to five wide early, moved in three then two wide on the far turn and failed to rally. FAMOUS ROCK STAR bumped a
rival at the start, was close up early four to five wide, dropped back and faded.
