POINT TWO settled well, advanced on the turn, ducked out sharply at the quarter pole bumping PLENTY OF VISION, responded and edged clear in the
stretch. PLENTY OF VISION chased while three wide, was bumped soundly at the quarter pole, took up sharply and was checked as a result and stayed on
thereafter. ANIME DAY led early, was headed on the turn, proved no match for the top pair and stayed on. ANNA CLAUSE saved ground and was always
outrun. SNAP AWAY forced the pace, gained a brief lead on the turn and weakened in the stretch. MISS FOO FOO was sluggish at the start and outrun.
FOLLOWING THE RACE, THERE WAS BOTH A STEWARD'S INQUIRY AND A JOCKEY'S CLAIM OF FOUL REGARDING AN INCIDENT IN THE
VICINITY OF THE QUARTER POLE. AFTER REVIEWING VIDEOTAPED REPLAYS, THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGES AND THE PLACINGS
REMAINED UNALTERED.

Footnotes
DARK SILENCE raced in striking position while three wide, advanced on the far turn, and kicked clear while three wide in the stretch. SHIMMERING
DREAM reserved early, commenced a bid on the far turn and closed ground while four wide in the stretch. GAME TO PLAY stalked the pace, dueled around
the far turn, proved no match for the top pair yet stayed on. SPARKLE O MINE settled well and lacked the needed bid. SASSY AIN'T I never menaced.
ANGEL'S MELODY sprinted clear, was headed leaving the far turn and yielded. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE was outpaced while four wide and faded. VALID
CAUSE took no part.
