Footnotes
BEACH PEACH tracked along the inside while in the two path around the turn, kept that path entering the lane while finding clear racing room as the leader
shifted outwards, rallied to bid for the lead at the furlong pole, forged an advantage a sixteenth out, and drew clear late. SUNSET AT MALLORY pressed the
pace two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole before drawing clear entering the lane, but met BEACH PEACH's inside challenge at the furlong
grounds, and was bested passing the sixteenth pole. PRINCESS MARYKATE was reluctant to load, then bobbled a bit at the start, settled far off of the pace
in the three path into the turn, got floated six wide turning for home, and rallied willingly to cut the gap on the leaders through the final furlong. FLORIS
chased three wide and between horses early on, sustained chasing position entering the lane, but faded in midstretch. MAPPED OUT saved ground off of
the pace, split foes two wide approaching the furlong pole while hanging on his left lead, but leveled off before threatening. LIGHT SHIFT lied forwardly
placed four wide early on, but faded around the turn. MOONSHINE PRINCESS took the turn in the four to five path while off of the pace, and tired on her left
lead through the lane. SHOE BIZ broke a step slowly and never got involved. FOX CREEK LADY set the pace inside of a group of pressing rivals, but was
headed at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened turning for home. SEANAIR'S SONG was outrun and showed little.

Footnotes
MR. BANYAN lied off of the pace early on, made first run at the clear leader into the far turn, steadily progressed under urging around that bend to bid for
the lead at the quarter pole as BIG IN THE CITY did the same, but scooted clear in upper stretch, and held sway from that chasing foe late. BIG IN THE
CITY gained ground three wide around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of MR. BANYAN at the quarter pole, but was turned away by that foe in upper
stretch, and kept on through the final furlong to secure place. DODGER established a clear advantage early on, showed the way under confident handling
from a pair of gaining foes around the far turn, but was roused as those foes made bids at the quarter pole, offered little resistance entering the lane, and
weakened. PHARAOH'S KITTEN hopped at the start while off poorly, and was outrun. MR. FLATTERY lied close up along the inside around the first turn,
but was done early.

BEAUTIFUL BELLA trailed patiently into the far turn, shifted three wide turning for home while commencing a rally, wore down the leader's margin through
the final furlong to produce a late bid, and got up at the wire. SWANAGE established a clear margin around the first turn, maintained that loose advantage
into the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch, but met BEAUTIFUL BELLA's bid in the late stages, and was nailed on the wire. MOANA'S TALE stalked the
clear leader from the outside, pressed that foe around the far turn, but faded in upper stretch. NANCY WORK saved ground off of the pace, stalked around
the far turn, but chased turning for home, and faded through the lane. WICKED STREET tracked three wide, but weakened around the far turn, and stopped
through the lane.

Footnotes
COINMAKER stalked along the inside, progressed on the clear leader's margin around the far turn, tipped two wide entering the lane, produced a good kick
to close the gap on the leader in the final furlong, and drove past that foe inside the finals sixteenth. GRAN CHEMIN dueled for the lead two wide around the
first turn, cleared into the backstretch and opened up a margin, maintained that clear advantage through midstretch, but was worn down by an outer foe late.
SUMMER STORE saved ground in midpack, shifted outside of the clear leader while inside of COINMAKER in upper stretch, but was outkicked by that
latter foe at the furlong grounds, and safely secured show. MORE ROMANCE sat reserved far off of the pace around the first turn, saved ground while
trailing around the far turn, and rallied mildly along the rail through the lane. MISS GETTY UP trailed early on, lied far off of the pace two wide around the far
turn, then improved in upper stretch, but failed to factor. FRONTIER DYNASTY tracked two to three wide, shifted four wide turning for home, but faltered in
upper stretch. FOREVER HOME saved ground off of the pace around the first turn, attempted a four wide rally around the far turn before getting floated five
wide turning for home, but failed to produce a bid and tired. FANTASTIC RIVA dueled for the lead along the inside around the first turn, allowed her outer
counterpart to clear into the backstretch, then weakened around the far turn.

Footnotes
ELUSIVE TARGET set the pace along the inside, felt stern pressure from a pair of outer foes into the turn, got headed by those foes passing the three
furlong pole, dropped back turning for home, but cut the corner and resurged entering the lane to re-forge an advantage from those rivals passing the three
sixteenths pole, and drew off thereafter. BEACH HOLIDAY stalked three wide while perched off of the leaders' flanks, inched closer into the turn to vie
around the bend, forged a narrow advantage passing the quarter pole, but got re-headed by his innermost counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, then
chased that foe home while holding place. WICKED GENIUS tracked four wide early on, pressed the leading trio while under mild urging around the turn,
then stayed on late to bid for place, but did not have enough to reach that position. LEVY tracked along the inside, shifted two wide turning for home, then
three wide in upper stretch, and chased between horses through the final furlong without producing a bid. RUBINSTEIN prompted the pace two wide and
between horses, vied around the turn, but yielded to those foes in upper stretch, and further faded through the final furlong. BIG COUNTRY never got
involved. CODE CLEAR was outrun.

Footnotes
MY DAWN dueled for the lead two wide, got the better of her inner game counterpart approaching the final sixteenth, drifted out slightly approaching the
wire as a pair of outer foes produced bids, but just held. THEDEVILYOUSAY stalked along the inside while in the two path, chased two wide through upper
stretch, progressed and altered course four wide a sixteenth out to rally outside of the leader, surged approaching the wire as and outside SHE'S GONE did
the same, but missed. SHE'S GONE tracked from off of the pace two wide, took a bump to her hind quarters from an inner foe in upper stretch, shifted five
wide at the furlong grounds, kicked on outside of foes in the final sixteenth to produce a late bid, but missed. LADYBELUCKY dueled along the inside, dug
in gamely to sustain the battle through upper stretch, but gave in a sixteenth out. DEVINE CHARGER saved ground off of the pace, bumped an outer foe in
upper stretch, then stayed on between horses to belatedly gain ground on the leaders through the late stages. BOURBON PRINCESS stalked two wide and
between horses early on, prompted the dueling pair from the outside around the turn, but faded on her left lead through the lane. ABOUKIR BAY was
outrun. NOBODY'S SECRET pressed the pace three wide, but bore out into the turn, required rider correction while losing position around the bend, and
was eased through the lane.

STRONG SILENT dueled for the lead three to two wide, assumed command approaching the quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch with STREET MISSY
in pursuit, and safely held thereafter. STREET MISSY settled far off of the pace four wide, rallied five wide around the far turn to be in range of the clear
leader in upper stretch, then chased that foe home willingly to prove second best. UPANDCOMINGSTAR dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, then
only inside of STRONG SILENT passing the five furlong pole, but proved no match for that foe approaching the quarter pole, and weakened through the
final furlong. APART OF MY CHARM vied two wide and between horses around the first turn, took back to stalk those rivals at the five furlong pole, but
failed to produce a rebid before fading through the lane. EDEN saved ground far off of the pace, but failed to factor. SHELL SHOCK lied off of the pace
three wide, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to make an impact. SOUTH GEORGIA tracked two wide, but came under a drive at the nine
sixteenths pole, saved ground while chasing around the far turn, but faded turning for home. VIETNAM tracked along the inside, but was through after a half
mile. VALLEJO lied far off of the pace two wide, and was outrun.
