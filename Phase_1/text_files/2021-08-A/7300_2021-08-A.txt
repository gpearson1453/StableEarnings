Footnotes
ADRIANNA JOY broke well on the inside, dictated the pace on the rail throughout, edged away from CHARMING FURY while under right-handed urging at
the top of the stretch and was fully extended to the wire. GIVE EM SHADE was caught three wide forwardly place on the first turn, continued to track just off
the leaders down the backstretch, angled inside to save ground on the far turn while improving position to get within striking distance, shifted out midstretch
and was outfinished to the wire. CHARMING FURY broke well between foes then pressed the pace throughout to the outside of ADRIANNA JOY, battled to
the furlong marker while under steady urging, taken in hand the last sixteenth and just held on the wire for show. CLASSIC WHISKEY was forwardly placed
four wide into the first, angled over to the rail well off the pacesetters into the far turn, continued to save ground through the bend, and just missed show late.
PILOTS STAR reared in the gate prior to the start, unhurried at the rear of the field to the half mile pole, improved three wide from the three eighths pole to
the quarter pole but failed to sustain the momentum in the stretch and flattened out for a minor share. DANIELLE'S DEAL was unnhurried in the early going,
shifted out four wide down the backstretch and proved no factor late. DESERT ARCH showed brief speed to track the leaders through the opening half then
faded to the wire. FOLLOWING THE RACE, A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF #6 PILOTS STAR WAS CONDUCTED. AS A RESULT,
PILOTS STAR WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER BUT WAS DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR PURSE MONEY.

Footnotes
OVERLY LUCKY was unhurried three wide in the early going, commenced a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole and drove clear in the lane while under
steady right-handed pressure. J P'S PRIDE (IRE) was forwardly placed three wide through the opening turn, tracked just off the dueling pacesetters on the
outside down the backstretch, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, led briefly, collared by OVERLY LUCKY in the lane and finished willingly to be second
best. WHERE'S JORDAN was reserved in the early going, improved position from the half mile to the quarter pole then angled out three wide, continued to
swing out six wide at the three sixteenths pole and closed well under steady pressure to get up for show. BIG FALCON ROCKET was allowed to settle in
the second flight, continued to track off the lead through the far turn, lacked room at the top of the lane but was outfinished late. NORTHERN PLAYBOY was
allowed to settle three wide through the opening half, continued three wide on the far turn while midpack, asked for run at the top of the lane but flattened
out while holding on for a minor share. ALWAYS COOL tracked the early pace on the rail, continued to save ground through the far turn but had no late kick.
GOPHER GOLD was unhurried on the inside through the opening stages, lacked running room in the final furlong but proved no threat. TRADE DEADLINE
dueled between foes to the top of the stretch but tired in the lane. JERSEY LUTE dueled on the rail then faded.

Footnotes
RASMUS tracked the early pace on the outside, bid four wide nearing the three eighths pole and drove clear in the lane under steady right and left handed
pressure. I'M A SPECIAL STAR was inside throughout, steadied nearing the eighth pole and edged foe late for second. FRONT OFFICE was allowed to
settle on the inside early, angled eight wide nearing the top of the lane and rallied for show. AZUSA ST. dropped back to settle three wide early, angled out
six wide nearing the quarter pole and was outfinished in the lane. OIL COLONY was off slow out of the gate, settled far back down the backstretch, swung
out nine wide at the top of the lane and passed tiring foes for a minor share. HENRY O'HENRY was sent through inside for the early lead, failed to sustain
bid at the top of the lane then drifted in nearly making contact with I'M A SPECIAL STAR but was immediately corrected by the rider and weakened through
the lane. WELL PRO pressed the pace three wide during the opening half then faded in the stretch. OTSEGO forced the early pace between foes then gave
way off the far turn.

Footnotes
ALL NATIVE settled outside in the fourth flight through the opening bend, commenced a three wide bid nearing the three eighths marker moving into
contention at the quarter pole, drove clear through the stretch under steady right-handed pressure and was much the best. ROZEY CHEEKS tracked the
early lead on the rail in the first flight, shifted out and took command nearing the quarter pole, led the field into the stretch but was outfinished in the final
furlong. MIDNIGHT CURRENT tracked on the rail in the second flight, loomed a major threat at the quarter pole, shifted out and was outkicked in the final
furlong. MISS BROOKSIDE was allowed to settle in the third flight, shifted out at the top of the stretch and gained mildly for a minor share. HURRICAIN
HUNTER was two wide in the second flight, bid three wide at the three sixteenths and flattened out in the stretch. IMMINENT THREAT dropped back to
track on the rail in the fourth flight, shifted out at the top of the stretch and had no late kick. ICYWILBURNYEH was off slow from the gate, settled two wide
through the first turn and failed to menace in the lane. HOLY IMAGE was squeezed back at the start, settled on the rail and proved no factor. ARNOLD'S
PATSY sent for the lead, angled to the rail, and faded in the lane.

GOTHAM CITY QUEEN tracked the early pace on the outside, commenced a three wide bid nearing the five sixteenths, and was all out under firm
right-handed pressure to prevail. KNIGHT'S HONOR broke well, dueled between foes through the bend, dug in at the furlong marker under right and
left-handed pressure but just missed. TEMUJIN LADY tracked the pace three wide into the turn, shifted out four wide at the furlong marker and was caught
gaining late. BINDING TIME tracked between foes into the bend, altered course to avoid foe nearing the furlong marker but flattened out in the lane. SOME
SAY SO forced pace between foes into the bend and weakened in the stretch. DODROPIN was slow into stride at the start, traveled three wide throughout
and had no rally. CELTICS WILDCAT dueled for the lead on the rail and gave way early.
