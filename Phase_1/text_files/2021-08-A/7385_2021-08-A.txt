Footnotes
CORVETTE SPIRIT unhurried in the beginning, moved up, four wide around the final turn, drove clear down the lane and was kept to the task. TROPHY
DADDY vied for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout, entered the second turn on the inside, angled out leaving the turn, made a bid and was a clear
second at the wire. MISS YOU JO raced in the middle of the pack, eased back, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two. U COMPLETE ME
dueled for the early lead, racing between rivals around the final turn and weakened. LISTEN TO ROSE raced near the back and was never a factor.
CHARMING BULLET lacked early speed, came around the final turn wide and was oudtrun. WAR ROGUE challenged on the front end in the early going,
saved ground and dropped back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
