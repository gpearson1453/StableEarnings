Footnotes
SPLENDA GAIL broke with the field, quickly moved up the inside to be clear before a furlong, continued to show the way by daylight out of the turn in the
two path, extended that advantage upper stretch and was not threatened in the final furlong to win ridden out. MY FRIEND AMY last away, raced back early,
came widest for the drive, rallied for the place while drifting in a bit late. TAYLORS BABE also broke back, raced back off the early pace as well off the
inside, came three wide for the drive, staged a mild rally to annex the show. MYLIES STAR within striking distance for three furlongs, came up empty in
lacking a response in the drive. EASY IS GOOD in the second flight up the backstretch, raced closest to the winner through the turn, also had little left for
the stretch run. LAKE RUNNER void of speed in trailing well back for three furlongs, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. SARAH'S
GOLDEN four wide through the turn when with the main body, tired in the drive. SECRET MOMENT forwardly placed while racing rank and greenly early,
stopped in the drive, finished well back. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
JONATHAN WHO in mid pack while racing off the inside, in the two path mid turn, angled out sharply when beginning to advance turning for home, kicked
down the leader inside the furlong marker to win going away. PIONEER PRIDE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear in the turn,
stretched that advantage out through upper stretch, proved no match for the winner the final sixteenth, all out to last for the place. TRAELEE last to leave,
trailed for three furlongs, swung out to be five wide into the stretch, closed well to be getting to the runner up late. TEN BUDS back off the early pace inside,
continued to save ground turn, improved position slightly while remaining inside. CAJUN BERTI in the second flight while racing three wide through much of
the turn, tired in the drive. BALKY chased the runner up for three furlongs, gave way in the two path turning for home.

Footnotes
CORRUZE broke on top, took back off the leaders, patiently handled behind the first flight up the backstretch, continued behind horses into the lane, slipped
through along the inside with less than a furlong remaining to challenged, edged away late under steady handling. YOUNG BULL broke in good order,
narrowly set the pace over entrymate inside, headed far turn, came in the two path when vying nearing the furlong marker allowing the winner the inside,
could not match strides with that one late, proved game in battling back for the place. PERFECT STAR prompted the issue while racing three wide,
advanced and challenged early in the second turn, vied into the lane, briefly put a had in front with a furlong remaining, outfinished for the place. SPEEDY
FELLAR pressured the runner up and entrymate while off the inside, put a head in front early in the far turn, continued to battle into and through upper
stretch, was in turn headed by PERFECT STAR with a furlong remaining, was also outkicked for the place late by that rival and aforementioned entrymate.
PEACOCK KITTEN within striking distance outside, raced four wide through the final turn, came up empty for the drive. PAYDAY TOO remained back in
lacking a rally. LAFITTE'S FLEET lacked speed while outside, also lacked a closing response. JAILHOUSE KITTEN last away, trailed throughout.

MY LITTLE FLACO void of speed after being bothered at the start, saved ground through the turn when beginning to improve into the lane, moved out a bit
past the furlong maker, late surge to be up in time. WIDDLE ZEE with the early pace while between rivals, garnered a larger lead midway on the turn, shook
well clear through early stretch, continued to hold a large advantage late, could not contain the winner while remaining well clear for the place. SILENT CRY
broke out, bothered outer foes, was straightened to race back off the pace, four out to six wide turning for home, rallied down the middle part of the strip to
be along for the show. COMERUNNINBOYS off a bit slow then was floated out and bother to in turn bump and bother BETTIN ON BRYAN, raced back and
outside, four wide turn, bumped with IZZY B WINN late in the bend, improved slightly while not having enough for the show. IZZY B WINN lacked speed
outside, four wide in traffic late in the turn, bumped with COMERUNNINBOYS, also improved slightly in the drive without posing a serious threat. BIG BOSS
MAN vied up front while three wide for a half and weakened. BETTIN ON BRYAN bumped and bothered at the start, recovered to race forwardly for a half,
backed up in the drive. SIR ETNEY JOHN broke out, bothered the winner, was straightened to contest the early pace along the inside, stopped after a half.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
ONE TIME GEM broke sharp, dueled up front along the inside for five furlongs, shook clear in the second turn, drew off down the lane, under firm handling.
CHOPPA STYLE in the second flight early out in the course, four wide through the second turn, improved to be closest to the winner past the furlong
grounds, proved no match for that one, determined for the runner up position. WILD ONE FOREVER settled in mid pack inside, continued to save ground
up the backstretch and through the second bend, improved into the lane, not enough for the place late. LAST BATTLE within striking distance off the inside
early, fell back in some traffic late in the final turn, continued in some tight quarters upper straight, improved a bit when clear the final furlong. TIN DELAY
back off the pace and the inside, three wide into the lane, traffic, brushed upper stretch, came up empty the final furlong when clear. RARE STRAIN
remained back while saving ground to no avail. EGEAUXTISM dueled up front outside the winner for five furlongs, gave way in the second turn, was tiring
when brushed upper stretch, continued to fade. TOE BANDIT failed to menace after a wide trip. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND
TIMED.

CURTIN'S UP with the pace from the start, dueled through the turn off the inside, shook off the other speed entering the stretch, larger lead midstretch, kept
to task with a firm right handed crop the final furlong. CLUB SODA back off he early pace while in some traffic with a half to run, two path through much of
the turn, steered out three wide for the drive, drifted nearing midstretch, remained clear for the second spot. FRANK THE MAYOR void of speed toward the
inside, behind horses entering the stretch, rallied from between foes to earn the show. PARLAY PETE forwardly placed while racing outside, came four wide
under the crop into the lane, lacked a significant closing response. LEO DEL REO broke on top, vied early between horses, shuffled back with four furlongs
to run, moved out, roused five wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire. MAY HOUR lacked speed well out in the strip, raced four wide into the bend,
floated six exiting, also failed to muster a rally. JAZZ IT UP moved up to contest the issue for three furlongs then gave way when the real running began at
the head of the lane. ELUSIVE D'ORO last to leave, never menaced.

NEW EAGLE settled off the pace and the inside, began to advance second turn, behind horses into the lane, steady handling in some traffic into the lane,
switched out late, late surge to be in time. BIG MONEY MACHINE off a step slow, trailed, moved closer on the outside to contend into the straight, put a
head in front past the furlong marker, led late, nipped at wire. JUST GUN IT pressed the issue off the inside, vied into the lane when challenging between
horses, could not match strides with the top two the final sixteenth, narrowly saved the show. DANCE KINGDOM broke with leaders, narrowly set the pace
inside, continued to battle along the inside past the furlong marker, gradually weakened in the late going. BAYOU JAM settled off the pace, came on the
outside for the drive, failed to deliver the needed rally. BIG POWER RED in the second flight for a half along the inside, began a steady fade after a half.

Footnotes
CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR broke with the leaders, fell back into the second flight, advanced to challenge four wide turning for home, roused, came out a bit to
be five wide into the lane, drew clear while being kept to pressure. QUIKFAST N AHURRY hopped at the start, lacked speed, five wide and behind the
winner turning for home, angled inside for the stretch run, no match, clearly second best. SHASTALOO broke out, bumped start, settled off the pace and the
inside, continued behind the lead pack second turn, dropped to the rail entering the stretch, squeezed through along the inside soon after, finished up best
of the rest. GREEN MONSTER away well, vied up front while between foes for six furlongs, began to weaken entering the stretch while remaining between
rivals. SMOK'N RITA void of speed while saving some ground, steered out for the drive, improved a bit by picking off a couple of tiring rivals late.
DISTRACTOR FACTOR bumped at the start, quickly recovered to contest the pace closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. ORB'S SOUL moved up
outside the opening quarter to contest the pace three wide, first to blink.

Footnotes
MINISTER'S MEDAL broke sharp, soon got clear, in hand through the turn, cruised home while expanding his advantage without being asked for his best to
win ridden out.. LEYTON'S HIPPIE raced in the second flight while outside, three path into the lane, no match for the winner, held sway for the place.
SASSY'S PROSPECTOR fell back off the pace, roused off the inside for the drive, evenly through the lane to be along for the show. KANNON WITH A K
broke out, bothered foe, chased the winner for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run in gradually weakening to lose a couple of positions through
the lane. HEAVENLY TRUMP broke back, trailed early, improved position without posing a serious threat. SHARP MEMORIES lacked speed, failed to
menace. GENES FEATHER unruly in the post parade, last to leave after being bumped, made little impact. HEZA FORTUNE finished early, trailed home.
