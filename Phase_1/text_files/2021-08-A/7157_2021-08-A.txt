while racing inside, fell back on the turn, continued willingly and finished second best. PEACHES LANE led to the turn, dropped back, leveled off and
finished best of the rest. EASY DOES IT was impeded at the start, raced far back early and improved position in an even effort. STEINWAY veered out at
the start and showed brief speed only. TOSSAPENNYDOWN was outrun. Hand timed.

LOOSE DIAMOND rallied around the far turn, challenged for the lead in the upper stretch, dueled and drew clear late to prove best. TACTICAL ATTACK
assumed command on the backstretch, inched away on the turn, responded when challenged to duel and yielded late, grudgingly. EXILED set the early
pace, fell back on the turn, finished evenly and held safely for show. MS SALLY passed tiring rivals. RIDE FOR GLORY was through after a half. BUDDY
NINER saved ground while racing close to the pace, was checked entering the second turn, dropped back and gave way. Hand timed.

Footnotes
OVER EZ set the pace, was under pressure throughout and held on gamely. PARLEY STREET pressed the pace, went willingly to the wire but couldn't gain
ground. PRIVATE JOKE held a good position and lacked the needed late response. QUETTA'S IN CHARGE trailed the field, offered a mild bid only and
improved position. ZERO SUM GAME was never far back, failed to rally and did not menace. SALSA VERDE raced close to the pace, bid inside and came
up empty. RED CLEM was outrun. Hand timed.
