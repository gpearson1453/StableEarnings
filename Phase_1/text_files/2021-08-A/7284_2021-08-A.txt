Footnotes
YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY stalked inside through the backstretch, waited patiently around the far turn, tipped three wide and headed in pursuit at the head
of the lane, roused forward under pressure and cleared late. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN tracked the leader then picked up the pace near the half mile marker,
dueled for the lead with CLOONITA around the far turn, battled on into the lane then got overtaken late by the winner. CLOONTIA cleared on top around the
first turn, set the pace then dueled inside of EARNEDNEVERGIVEN around the far turn, battled on into the lane then had no closing kick left in reserve.
CHATEAU DE VIZILLE rated outside a rival through the backstretch, went three wide into the lane and needed more for serious impact. MINE TO HOLD
was unhurried, saved ground into the lane and lacked a needed rally. PEPPI THE HUNTER rated inside through early stages, moved out and raced five
wide into the lane and never threatened.

CAPT CANDY and kept clear. CAPT. CANDY was forwardly placed two wide around the turn, went after WISH ME HOME top of the stretch, raced up close
but could not reach the winner and had to settle for second best. CLOUDS OF WHITE hustled along two wide around the turn, went four wide into the lane
and rallied for a share. AUCTION KINGDOM raced inside around the turn, shifted out heading into the lane and had a mild improve. ARLO BELLO raced off
the pace two wide, went four wide into the lane and never threatened. A LOT LIKE XMAS chased the top two leaders then gave way. HAD A FEELING

Footnotes
SOME NIGHTS raced off the early speed, picked up the pace midway around the turn, went five wide into the lane, gathered momentum under steady
pressure and edged away. OUR STRONG VOWS chased in contention, launched a inside bid at the head of the lane, took the lead then got outkicked by
the winner. ISLAND PHILO chased the leader and saved ground around the turn, moved out three wide top stretch then stayed on with response for a
share. SASSY MELLY set the pace and held on top to mid-stretch then gave way. DANCING IN FIRE lacked speed inside, shifted out wider for the drive
and improved position. NANIE'S TREASURE tracked the leader in the two path around the turn then weakened in the lane. INDEHERE raced five wide into
the lane and lacked a needed rally. STACIA'S WILDFIRE raced in range along the rail around the turn then weakened in the lane. JULIE ANN failed to
respond. PREGOLYA RIVER raced inside off the pace and never menaced.
