ENCHANTING WAY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased her advantage into the lane and drew off as a handy winner.
LET IT REIGN chased the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that rival in the drive but clearly second best. RODEO ROSE chased the
leaders while racing four-wide and failed to gain in the drive. CELINAS BLUE BIRD chased the leaders while racing three-wide for the opening quarter and
weakened. TAZEETI lagged throughout.

DOUBLE PERFECTION was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and was ridden out to
be kept to task. ALEX'S MOJO was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and rallied late. REDDISH lacked early speed, saved
ground through the turn and finished with good late energy. ADJUDGED pressed the pace from between foes and gave way through the final furlong.
LINCHTOWN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. BROTHERS pressed the pace while racing four-wide and
weakened in the drive.

E Z STAR MAKER settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch, responded to steady urging and was up in the
closing yards. TEASPOON OF PEPPER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good energy to just miss. PERFECT
BLOSSOM pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take a brief lead in mid-stretch and yielded to the top pair. SUNSHINE EMILY was away in
good order to duel for the lead from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. JUPITER S. was off slow, lagged early and did not reach contention.

FRANKS FIX IT was away in good order to press the pace of MARCH ON LINCH from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the half, opened a
clear margin with a quarter to run and was fully extended to hold TRUTH TO POWER safe late. TRUTH TO POWER was reserved just off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. MARCH ON LINCH set a pressured pace from between foes and weakened after
going six furlongs. TAP THE BANK lagged early, saved ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. SHORT CUT was off slow, pulled up
after going three-quarters and walked off.

LITTLE JOHN was bumped at the start, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn, responded to steady handling and was up in the closing
yards. CITY STEEL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. PROUDTOBESICILIAN broke sharply
to duel for the lead with FACTORIAL while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival with a sixteenth to run but could not resist the two rivals from over the
top. FACTORIAL disputed the pace with PROUDTOBESICLIAN from the inside and gave way through the final sixteenth. DOCTOR BRUCE S. settled off
the leaders from the inside and finished evenly in the drive. LEGITIMATE CAUSE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn angled out nearing
the quarter and was not a factor. SEVENTH WAVE was bumped at the break, pressed the pace from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and
weakened.

LADY showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FORTUNE IN SILK settled off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn and failed to rally. DAZZLING DEBBI lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GUIDED BY

Footnotes
NATIONHEART was away in good order to duel for the early fractions with BENNYANDTHECHICKS while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin
nearing the three-eighths marker and drew off through the lane as a handy winner. STREET DEMAND was reserved just off the leaders early, moved
four-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. A GEM IS A GEM lacked early speed, saved ground
through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished evenly. BLOODHORSE BUD showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. BENNYANDTHECHICKS was off a step slow, rushed to vie with the winner and weakened after the opening quarter.

Footnotes
PRINCESS CAROLINE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a
furlong to run and was ridden out to be kept to task. COASTAL AFFAIR dueled for the lead from the inside, was no match for the winner in the drive but
finished well to hold the place. SKY'S THE LIMIT lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and finished with
good late energy. LONSDALEITE showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. LIRIO TIGRADO broke out, chased the
leaders while racing four-wide, offered a bid nearing the quarter and gave way. SHEZJUSTINTHYME was away in good order to press the pace while racing
three-wide and weakened through the final furlong.
