late and held off the runner up. POSTINO'S IDOL tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, launched a strong late bid,
closed willingly but was denied. ASHLEY'S HOPE pulled in the early stages, raced two wide off the pace, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly
outside. MODEL BEHAVIOR raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and closed mildly on the rail. POSTINO'S CHAMPION was off slowly,
had a three wide trip racing off the pace and failed to threaten. HEADING HOME stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and weakened. I'M LISTENING
raced off the pace between horses, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with the winner and faded in the final furlong. JOY'S PRIDE hit the gate and
