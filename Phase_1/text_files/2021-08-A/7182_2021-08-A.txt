drive. JUSTA DOLL tracked the early pace four wide, came five wide into the stretch and finished willingly gaining the place award late. PRIME N PROPER
broke inwardly at the start bumping a rival, then set a pressured pace on the inside, faded in the drive while besting the rest. MOREINTHEHAMPTONS was
reserved early, then advanced five wide on the turn and offered a belated rally on the outside. SHES MY TREASURE was allowed to settle early and made
a three wide advance on the turn but flattened out in the drive. SENORITA EMMA was bumped at the start, then chased the early pace on the inside and
weakened, failed to menace. BRIDLE PARTY chased the early pace in between rivals and stopped.

CORSIDAT stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, drifted out leaving the turn while drawing clear, then drifted out through the stretch
while remaining clear to prove best under a drive. SHARP JUSTICE ducked in leaving the chute forcing GET LUCKY JUSTICE in as well, then moved up to
be well placed on the inside, eased out to make a three wide bid leaving the turn, split rivals by the three sixteenths pole, then drifted in by the furlong
marker, but could not gain on the winner late while clearly second best. SUMMER PICNIC was allowed to settle early and came three wide into the drive,
won the battle for the show award while no match for the top two rivals. GET LUCKY JUSTICE was bumped after the start and forced in leaving the chute,
then raced on the inside and lost the bob for the show award. BARBIE JEAN was soon clear after the start to set the pace on the inside, then had nothing
left in the drive. THE STONE EVENT raced three to four wide into the turn, then was four wide by the quarter pole while being no factor.

Footnotes
TRAUMARAMA was reserved early and saved ground throughout, made a inside bid leaving the turn then edged clear in the furlong grounds to prove best
under a drive. MAGNA G FORCE was four wide into the first turn, then settled in three to two wide on the backstretch, moved to the inside by the five
sixteenths pole, then swung out five wide leaving the turn while advancing, then once straightened finished willingly but was outfinished by the winner.
ARIAN RAE tracked the early pace and was two wide down the backstretch, then made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to gain a short advantage
nearing the furlong marker, but faded late. DIRTY DIXIE ROAD set the early pace while clear and on the inside, came off the rail leaving the turn and faded
in the drive. AIR TURBULENCE was reserved early while two wide on the backstretch, offered no rally. SEDUCTIVE (IRE) was three wide into the first turn,
then chased the pace three wide on the backstretch, was four wide by the quarter pole and weakened. BOLD CONCEPT was void of early speed and was
not a factor.

PURPLE DREAM steadied after the start, then settled in three wide down the backstretch, made a four wide move when ready on the far turn, moved in
when straightened and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best while being ridden out. TROPICAL TORNADO set the pace while on the inside, then
was headed past the quarter pole and stayed on gamely for the place award. MY MIRACLE MAN was bumped at the start, then was rated towards the
inside, then saved ground entering the stretch while advancing but needed a stretch bid while being along for the show award. FREER was carried out
seven wide on the first turn, then chased the pace and made a four wide bid to press the pace and then came up empty in the drive. DEEP MIND drifted out
on the first turn, then chased the early pace three wide and made a bid three wide but weakened. ROYAL DRAGOON was off slowly, no factor. AMERICAN
DRAMA broke in and bumped at the start, then was not a threat.

HARD LUCK JUSTICE was well placed throughout, tracking the pace setter two wide, made a three wide leaving the turn when ready, then drew off in the
stretch to prove much the best under a few right handed crop reminders. NOBODY LISTENS set the pace while clear on the inside, was headed leaving the
turn and proved to be no match for the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. A FEW TOO MANY chased the early pace three wide, came into
the drive three wide and was empty while besting the rest. ALTERED was settled back early, swung out four wide for the drive to have a belated rally for the
minor rewards. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was bumped at the start, then was outrun early towards the inside, moved out leaving the three eighths pole to make
a five wide move on the far turn, came six wide into the drive and flattened out late. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT was allowed to settle early in between horses,
then moved over to the inside on the far turn and weakened. LOOKIN AT JUSTICE was bumped at the start, then was three wide into the first turn, then
settled in four wide down the backstretch and tired. ROYAL ICING was four wide into the first turn, then was settled five wide down the backstretch and
stopped. AZZARO STEEL broke in at the start bumping a rival, then raced on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
PEARL TIARA was away alertly to set the pace while racing off the rail, was headed leaving the turn, then battled determinedly to the wire to win resolutely
under a drive. DIAMOND SOLITAIRE was well placed towards the inside on the backstretch, made a inside bid leaving the turn to go on even terms for the
lead and gained a short advantage by the furlong marker but was outfinished late to just miss in a gutsy effort. RUSSIAN INFLUENCE chased the early
pace three wide, then made a five wide bid leaving the quarter pole to loom boldly, but flattened out the final furlong while racing on the left lead.
TUCKYOURTALEANDRUN was four wide into the first turn, then stalked the pace and made a four wide bid on the far turn but came up empty the final
furlong. MIZZEN ASH was settled back early on the inside, advanced on the turn and swung out six wide for the drive and finished evenly. SWIFT TEMPLE
lacked a solid rally. TIMELESS GLORY was three wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide on the backstretch and weakened. VOODOO JUSTICE
stalked the pace three wide and weakened. THUNDERSTRUCK tired and was vanned off. MISS DEPUTY STAR was off slowly, not a factor.
