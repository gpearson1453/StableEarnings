Footnotes
CAPTAIN ZIGGY moved in to save some ground entering the first turn, eyed the leaders from a distance up the backstretch, took closer order getting
roused past the midway point of the far turn, rallied outside and swept by in deep stretch to win going away. CAMPEADOR hugged the rail to midway on the
far turn, shifted out three wide to the stretch, bid between horses past the furlong marker and settled for second best. LORD DARNLEY was never far back,
could not kick on with the top two leaving the eighth-pole, and finished one-paced. HIGH PRESS set the pace inside, remained clear with a furlong
remaining, then shortened stride and gave way. HE AIN'T NO SAINT worked his way inside going to the first turn, stayed near the rail and failed to menace.
DUEL FUEL was five wide into the first turn, moved in after that and could not reach contention. DIVINE CONTROL was never prominent. CONGRATS
AGAIN was in tight between horses at the start, and raced far back inside. BYE BYE DAVID lunged at the start and was off slow, and raced far back
throughout. OVERSTATED was always outrun. M V SPEED broke out and was steadied being corrected, and raced at the rear. SWIPE LEFT was four wide
on the first turn, and never got close.

Footnotes
FOSTER HOPE vied outside down the backstretch, cleared and angled in entering the turn, set the pace along the rail from there, shook clear in upper
stretch and held clear under a drive. NKETIAH chased the pace between foes, steadied entering the turn, saved ground around most of the turn, advanced
inside in upper stretch and stayed to gain the place without threatening the winner. VALID EXCHANGE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two
wide, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths marker, moved up outside nearing the lane but was one-paced through the stretch. CURRENT HOPE led
early but was outsprinted by the winner nearing the turn, chased inside around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. BERHANU stumbled
at the start, stalked the pace two wide and weakened in the lane. ERIN GO BRAUGH failed to menace while racing four wide. LITTLE DUDE threw his head
just prior to the start and was thus unprepared for the start, rushed up outside into contention, tracked three wide around the turn and came up empty in the
lane. ACASEADAY played no factor while racing three wide. COTTON JIM was bumped at the start and then outrun inside. SUPER EDGAR bobbled at the
break, was hustled inside, steadied into the turn, was taken up sharply nearing the seven-sixteenths marker, plummeted to the rear and was not urged from
there.

Footnotes
CREATIVE GIRL broke to the lead and moved inside, shook clear around the turn, and widened through the stretch under pressure. VEILED PROPHET
swung four wide off the turn, and rallied late between rivals to get the place. SNEAKY CHEEKY was outsprinted early, fanned wide off the turn, and rallied
mildly outside. LILY'S LEAD saved ground in range early, moved out three wide past the quarter-pole, rallied into second through midstretch, then
weakened inside rivals. EASY COME EASY GO broke slowly, lagged well back two wide for three-eighths of a mile, and passed tired horses. NUMERIC
was no factor inside. SPECTACULAR GAL broke two lengths slow, and was never in it. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER was outrun inside. BRUSH WITH THE
LAW (IRE) was outrun three to four wide. ANNA'S DREAM pressed the pace three wide to upper stretch, and had nothing left past the eighth-pole.
TSAYONARA SLEW brushed the rail early and steadied, and was always far back. MISS BLUEBIRD pressed the early pace between rivals for three
furlongs, and faltered.

Footnotes
BONNO settled off the duel in the clear in the three path, angled six wide in upper stretch as the pacesetters drifted out, slowly gained outside and was up
on the wire. DR. ROGER dueled inside, drifted out into about the four path turning for home, continued on the left lead in the lane, fought on inside through
the wire and just missed. BRONX dueled three wide down the backstretch, dueled two wide around the turn, was floated five wide turning for home, battled
on between foes through the lane and just missed. COMPASS CAY was pinched back at the start, advanced three wide around the turn, swung six wide
near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out. TRINNI JOHN raced off the pace four wide and had a mild gain. TINTORERO
steadied early, raced two wide around the turn and never threatened. LUCA DREW THE ACE failed to menace while racing three wide. BILLY BONES was
outrun inside. BLAME CHARLIE dueled between foes down the backstretch and retreated inside around the turn. CROOKED CURRENCY had brief speed
outside.

Footnotes
HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE saved ground covered up behind the leaders for three furlongs, tipped outside JACK AND NOAH turning for home, kicked past
that rival and edged away through the late stages. TIGER BLOOD was outsprinted to the stretch in the two-path, altered course to the rail rallying past the
eighth-pole, moved out from behind HARRY'S ONTHELOOSE late and finished gamely for the place just inside ROMARIO. The latter raced four wide
around the turn, gained through the furlong grounds but needed more late. STAR WEAVER was a step slow to begin and trailed for three furlongs, and
improved position through the stretch outside rivals. JACK AND NOAH (FR) dueled early inside WARRIOR'S PRIDE, moved away from that one on the
turn, drifted off the rail weakening into the stretch, and was overhauled from both sides. YES I AM FREE raced three wide around the turn, and faded
through the stretch. CAJUN BROTHER was no factor inside. WARRIOR'S PRIDE dueled early outside JACK AND NOAH, got outpaced around the turn,
and folded up.

Footnotes
YOLANDA'S PRIDE broke on top, saved ground making all the pace, and held sway through the stretch under pressure. TAMMANY hugged the rail all the
way, finished with good courage but could not reach the winner. ESKIMO'S BOSS prompted YOLANDA'S PRIDE from outside, could not make an
impression under urging past the midway point of the far turn, and was outfinished for second. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN raced in the two-path on the turns,
and lacked the needed closing bid. SMART SPENDING bobbled a stride from the gate, raced in the second flight to the stretch, and gained only mildly. ALL
QUALITY raced three wide on the turns, and was outfinished. STARRY HOPE had the three-path for six furlongs, moved further out for the drive and made
no headway. WONDER BLONDY broke two lengths slow, angled to the rail first time through the lane, tried unsuccessfully to get through inside TAMMANY
leaving the half-mile marker, and tired. HEIRESSINDY showed little at the back.

CHANCELLOR BAY stalked the pace three wide, took over near the three-eighths pole, drew clear and angled in soon after then widened under a drive.
SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING settled off the pace two wide, split rivals three wide to bid near the quarter pole, could not keep pace with the winner in the lane
but held well enough to preserve the place. STRIKE HARD was off slowly, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and
was one-paced through the stretch. MORGAN POINT saved ground and failed to menace. KUHL STAR played no factor while racing three wide. CUPID'S
DUDE was outrun while racing three wide. FAST N STEADY advanced four wide around the turn and retreated through the lane. SUMMER FIVE was off
slow, raced five wide and made little impact. RIDE ON BYE had only brief speed. CORPORATE AFFAIR was up close three wide and was through after a
half. SUN VIKING set the pace along the rail and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
FREEDOM MATTERS saved ground close up for a half-mile, shifted outside SURPRISE FACTOR on the far turn, challenged for command at the top of the
stretch in the three-path, took over past the eighth-pole and held off TUNE IN to the wire. TUNE IN advanced after six furlongs, had aim outside FREEDOM
MATTERS through the furlong grounds, and could not get by while clearly second best. KAUFY BEAN saved ground improving position on the far turn, had
the two-path through the lane and finished evenly. YAMATO was outrun for six furlongs, moved out for the drive and gained belatedly. SURPRISE FACTOR
set the pace inside, got collared turning for home, and gave way. LOUDER THAN BOMBS cut the corner advancing after six furlongs, but could not sustain
the rally. ROBINTAKINCHARGE prompted the pace outside, and faded after six furlongs. NEW YEAR raced in the second flight well out in the course, and
posed no threat. THE VIRGINIAN was unhurried early in the second flight, lacked room behind a wall of horses approaching the top of the stretch, and gave
way. SHANANIES PAYNTER raced three to four wide throughout, and tired. FINANCIAL SYSTEM was three wide on the first turn, went further out on the
far turn, and could not gain.

Footnotes
SHEA D SUMMER set the pace along the rail, ceded the advantage to KAMAR TAJ around most of the turn, regained command nearing the lane and drew
off under a drive. RESTOFTHESTORY stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner but finished willingly to gain
the place. COMPETITIVE SPEED tracked the pace three and four wide, was brushed nearing the eighth pole, rallied outside and just missed second.
KAMAR TAJ lunged at the start then came in and bumped PRINCESS SECRET, rushed up outside, took the lead early on the turn, vied outside of the
winner around the bend, drifted out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, brushed COMPETITIVE SPEED nearing the eighth pole, gave way then
lugged in through the final sixteenth. COACH JER'S JOY saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. PRINCESS
SECRET was bumped at the start, trailed well off the rail and was eased in the lane.

Footnotes
VIVI'S DREAM'S bumped with SENORITA SALSA at the start, set the pace inside, repelled a bid from SWEET PENELOPE turning for home and edged
away, then had enough to hold on late. STARRY JAYLEN was slow from the gate and lagged well back for three furlongs, fanned widest for the drive and
was gobbling up ground to the finish. DRIVING WIND raced in the second flight two to three wide to the stretch, and finished with interest between horses.
SENORITA SALSA bumped with VIVI'S DREAM'S at the start, had a rail trip and lacked a solid closing response. SWEET PENELOPE chased three wide,
loomed a threat outside VIVI'S DREAM'S approaching the lane, got shaken off through upper stretch, and was overrun from both sides late. JULIE BIRD
(IRE) pursued the pacesetter from between horses, and weakened through the stretch. SHE'S SO SERIOUS raced four to five wide, and failed to menace.
LADY PAYNTER broke slowly and was outrun two to three wide. BELLE'S KINGDOM stayed close four wide for three-eighths of a mile, and tired. TRULY
AMBITIOUS was never prominent. MY TURNING POINTE was outrun inside.
