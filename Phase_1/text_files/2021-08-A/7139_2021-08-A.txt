Footnotes
NORTHERN DIAMOND sprinted clear, held well into the stretch, dug in and repelled the challenge of BLINKERS in the last forty yards. The latter settled
well, advanced on the turn, was swung four wide into the and closed ground willingly. NAUGHTY SHIRLEY stalked the pace, moved closer on the turn and
lacked the needed bid in the stretch. KASSERINE PASS chased while three wide and lacked a rally. BAYDAR saved ground and offered no response when
called upon. EURO ME bobbled at the start and trailed.

Footnotes
CARPE VICTORIAM dwelt at the start, chased the entire field early, advanced while five wide in the turn and stayed on while four wide in the stretch to
prevail. KID'S MISCHIEF forced the pace, moved to the front in the late going and was reeled in. DANCE DOCTOR set a contested pace, held well into the
stretch and was worn down late. CHUCKMATE chased while four wide and lacked a rally. ONE STOP SHOP was void of speed. A J SAMURAI showed
little. CORRANA EN LIMEN retreated.
