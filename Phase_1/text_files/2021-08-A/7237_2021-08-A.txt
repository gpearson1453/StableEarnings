NOT JOKING raced six wide early, then four wide on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, rallied outside and earned the place spot.
PECAN PATTIE raced off the pace inside, moved up outside on the far turn, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied mildly outside and got third.
SCATNAP pressed the pace raced close up in the two path, bid on the turn, dueled with the winner, put a head in front, then weakened in the final furlong.
SENSE A MILLION raced four wide early, settled off the pace between rivals, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally. LOTTIE'S MIZZION raced five
wide early, three wide on the first turn, continued three wide and lacked a rally. OCEANO ROSSO tracked close up on the rail, chased and gave way.

DONYA'S MAGIC set the pace on the inside, showed the way on the far turn, responded when asked, kicked clear and dug in determinedly inside to hold
off the runner up. SHE FLED THE SCENE bobbled at the break, tracked on the inside, saved ground on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane,
finished willingly but second best. REAL WILD SOLUTION raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, came two wide into the stretch and rallied
inside for third. MUSETTA pressed the leader early on, then stalked two wide, chased between rivals on the far turn and was outkicked for the show spot.
STONEY'S MONKEY was off a bit slow, trailed the field, came three wide into the lane and closed belatedly. LEXOPHILIA was off a bit slow, raced three
wide early, four wide at the half mile, four wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. TWISTED TREASURE was off slowly, raced four wide early, settled off the
pace, went three wide on the far turn and had no rally. TRACK MAGIC raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. VIKING QUEEN raced off the
pace, three wide at the half mile marker, chased on the far turn and tired. SUCCESSFUL LEGACY stalked close up three wide, chased three wide on the far
turn and tired. SAYOH steadied at the start, raced three wide off the pace, came five wide into the lane and tired. MAGICAL ROMANCE raced three wide
early, then two wide off the pace and faded. ZAP MAMA raced off the pace inside and gave way.

Footnotes
MISSION TRAIL broke awkwardly and was steadied, quickly recovered and moved up between horses into contention, then three wide, made a strong run
on the turn, rallied to the front passing the quarter pole, drew clear and then held on late. GONE DREAMING chased two wide, chased on the turn, rallied
three wide into the stretch and was gaining late. DARESCA raced off the pace between rivals, rode the rail into the stretch, angled out and rallied mildly.
DUSTINTHEWIND was outrun early and closed belatedly for a share. BETTER BOAT showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled with the winner
briefly passing the quarter pole, then weakened. NO SYMPATHY was off slowly, raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten. SIP'N DIP bobbled at the
break, chased inside and faded. THAWED chased three wide and faded. FIRST TO TEA raced off the pace inside and gave way.
