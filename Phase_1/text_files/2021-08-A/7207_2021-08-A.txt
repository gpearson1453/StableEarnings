Footnotes
CAGEY broke alertly, sat just off the pace from the three path, drove four wide then struck the front approaching the furlong mark and remained clear to the
wire. BAINE THE BULL advanced inside through the turn, angled out to the four path, rallied steadily outside through the drive but was unable to stall the
winner. BIG AND FLASHY tracked inside, roused at the quarter pole, shifted out to the three path nearing the stretch and weakened late. HEREVERYWISH
saved from the two path, chased and passed tiring rival late. BREACH OF CONTRACT trailed early then circled the field into the lane and showed a mild
interest late. CALEDON SUMMER vied for the early lead, led the field through the backstretch, was challenged near the quarter pole and gave way.
ABERDEEN ANNIE failed to threaten. COLLAR ME FIRST stalked four wide and tired early. FINDERS KEEPERS tracked outside and faded steadily.

Footnotes
DIPLOMATICA raced in striking range, asked to quicken approaching the final turn, shifted out to the four path, gained outside under steady encouragement
and won driving. SHE LOVES WINNIN broke outward leaving, vied outside of TAKE ME TO BATTLE, dueled to the quarter pole and was out finished.
KEKE KIMONO dismounted rider prior to loading, broke out leaving the gate, raced four wide through the far turn, was kept under steady handling, was
bumped mid stretch and edged clear for show honors. TAKE ME TO BATTLE vied inside leaving the gate, dueled inside of SHE LOVES WINNIN, was
unable to move on with rival, shifted out bumping into KEKE KIMONO and gave way grudgingly inside late stretch. GAYELETTE stalked five wide, chased
two wide in the turn and was unable to improve position through the drive. MIDNITESWILDAGAIN last away, advanced along the rail in the far turn, swung
out wide into the lane and failed to threaten. GWIZZ lacked running room into the turn and chased to no avail. LILBITSPICY loaded without the rider, sat in
range and tired.

Footnotes
TORIADOR sped to the front to secure a rail position, saved ground while setting the pace from just off the rail, shook away from HARD TO COME HOME
at the quarter pole and was kept to task while clear. HARD TO COME HOME sat just of the pace from the two path, pressed the issue nearing the quarter
pole but was no match for the winner through the drive and held for place. TRADER LYNN allowed to settle in stride, advanced steadily inside into the final
turn, rallied inside of RED CHOCOLATE and lasted for show honors. RED CHOCOLATE angled in while racing two wide through the opening turn, took
closer order leaving the backstretch, drove two wide into the stretch and weakened in the final strides. IRISH TRICK raced in close quarters in the opening
turn then in second flight while four wide, rallied four wide into the stretch and evened out late. ALL UNDER CONTROL rated off the pace from the rail,
asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole and flattened in stretch. BIG AL'S VISION raced three wide into the first turn, sat mid pack while five wide in the
backstretch and lacked a bid. JUMEIRAH COAST raced four wide and offered little. TANNIN reserved early and tired.

Footnotes
PRECIOUS NOTES showed early speed outside then crossed over approaching the opening turn, contested the early pace outside of RAININ ON BOARD,
came under encouragement and opened up to the stretch. MARACOCA'S DREAM hustled away, chased wide into the lane and gained late finishing clear
second best. RAININ ON BOARD sent for inside speed, contended the pace from just off the rail, was unable to move on with the eventual winner and
flattened through stretch. NOT YOUR BIZINESS encountered traffic early, angled in to the four path into the turn and offered a mild rail bid into stretch.
FOOL IN THE RAIN chased four wide and lacked a kick. AMBER RIDGE vied between early, chased the pacesetters through the turn and yielded.
CAUGHT ON CAMERA chased throughout. DISTINCT LADY hurried away and was outrun. I'MAMUDDERTOO showed little. CHILLIN WITH CHIP never
reached contention. SPOTTY DOTTY hustled inside and left nothing left in reserve late.
