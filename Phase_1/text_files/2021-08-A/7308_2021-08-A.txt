Footnotes
SPICY SHOT allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off in the late going.
SAMURAI ZIP hopped at the start, vied for the early lead on the outside, bid outside of the leader into the stretch gaining a short lead, then was no match
for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. GRAZED MY BISCUITS set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened
late and held the show. FLY FRIENDLY SKY mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and got up for a share.
I'M A COOL MAN well placed and outside, angled in to save ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. WILD WINTER was never involved.

Footnotes
UNION GEN. GEORGE mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid three wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off late.
KING OF THE RING allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, angled widest into the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for the place.
RESIST THE DEVIL mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the second, bid three wide into the lane and lacked the needed late kick. TITRATE
well placed, took command into the backstretch, increasing his margin, then weakened late and held a share. QUIET AMIGO set the early pace on the
inside, stayed on when challenged into the backstretch, then weakened in the stretch. SMILES OF JOY well placed, saved ground through the turns, came
through inside of rivals into the stretch and had no rally. NEW DAWN was no factor.
