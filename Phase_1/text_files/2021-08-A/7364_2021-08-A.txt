came around the second turn four wide, made a steady wide gain and was a clear third. HOG WILD went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and tired
down the stretch. TOUCH OF GOLD void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. ONE HITTER raced evenly near the back and was no
threat. MORO MISCHIEF raced within contention and faded. LIGHTNING LEE always raced near the back and showed little. TWO CHIPS challenged for
the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and dropped back. RACE WAS HAND TIMED
