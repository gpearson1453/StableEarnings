OUTRIDER was sent to a clear lead early on to set all the pace along the inside, was challenged nearing the quarter pole, dug in and drew off to be well
clear through the drive under steady handling. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN tracked the early leader down the backstretch, moved up to challenge nearing the
quarter pole but was no match for the winner in the stretch run to finish second best. NED CHRISTIE dropped back early on, raced four wide at the quarter
pole and had not enough for the top pair. EL LAY stalked the early pace from the inside and tired.

Footnotes
GRACIANA pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the far turn and held well under strong handling. ENGLISH stalked the
pace, moved up along the inside around the far turn, lacked room near the three sixteenths pole, bumped with rival and finished willingly to the wire. MY
TOMMY LEE lunged at the break, settled off the early pace, was bumped by English near the three sixteenths pole, raced four wide and kept on to the wire.
SPITZ showed good early early speed to set all the pace and gave way the final eighth of a mile. MISSEN THE POINT was forwardly placed to lay up close
from the outside, raced four wide into the upper stretch and tired. SWAY TO GO took bad steps soon after the break and was pulled up. Sway to Go was
vanned off.

GODSGIFT was allowed to settle early on, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished well to draw clear in the final stages under strong
encouragement. LA GUERRERITA stalked the early pace, moved up near the rail in the stretch run but was no match for the winner. ANTECEDENCE was
slow in the early stages, moved up near the inside around the far turn, angled five wide through the lane and showed good late interest. HOODWINK
showed good early speed to set the pace from the inside, raced two wide in the stretch and weakened the final eighth of a mile. COOKIN ROSES was
coaxed along early to lay up close, raced three deep through the lane and faded. ARBITRARY stalked the top pair and failed to sustain a bid.

missed in a game effort. QUALITY HOUR was slow early on, moved up five wide through the lane but had not enough for the top pair. QUIET PRAYER

GET HAMMERED showed good early speed to set the early pace and drew off in the drive to be well clear under steady pressure. AGGRESSIVITY stalked
the early pace, raced three wide through the stretch and finished second best. CYRIL'S BOY stalked the early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch
run and had no final winning bid. TWO WORLDS was squeezed back at the break, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and
never was a factor. FRONTANA broke to the inside, dropped off the early pace, raced four wide at the quarter pole and had no response in the drive.
GROVE DADDY was off slowly and never was involved.
