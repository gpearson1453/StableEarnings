Footnotes
UNIQUE BABE was reluctant to load, raced up close early, saved ground off the leader on the turn, came out leaving that bend with aim, struck the lead
about a sixteenth out and edged past. ITZ THE DITZ set the tempo from outside after moderate urging following the break, moved in from the three to the
two path on the turn once clear, challenged in mid-stretch and was simply outkicked while clearly second best. ZIPPIN BY U bobbled ever so slightly at the
break then was allowed to settle in behind the leaders along the inside, saved ground before coming out a bit turning for home then out a further path near
mid-stretch, got up for show honors late over BRANDISTYLED, who hopped just slightly at the break, was coaxed forward between runners early then
continued to chase from outside going two to three wide on the turn, was asked for more nearing the quarter pole but began to weaken and drifted in a path
in mid-stretch while tiring. SENSATIONAL SONG was mid-pack racing outside, went in the four path on the turn and was never a threat. DE FELINA'S
SONG lacked early speed racing wide, went five to six deep on the turn and was not a factor. SHADE OF ACK ACK was taken off the inside, showed little.

Footnotes
DON WITH THE WIND tracked the leaders from inside, advanced to the fore past the three-sixteenths drifting out several paths leaving the turn, drifted in a
bit in mid-stretch and edged clear under steady handling. LIMITED OFFER set the pace from off the inside, was two wide between foes on the turn, drifted
out entering the stretch, kept on to secure the place. S S WINSTON bobbled ever so slightly at the start, stalked the leaders early then advanced between
foes three wide into the turn, drifted out leaving that bend, flattened out in the lane. FANTASY SUITE attended from outside, went four wide on the turn,
drifted out a bit coming out of that bend and failed to rally. KEATON broke in the air, switched outside going in the four to five path on the turn, was never a
threat. INDIAN NIGHTS chased briefly from between runners, dropped back while four then three wide on the turn and continued the retreat.

Footnotes
RITZY STORM settled in behind the leading group shifting in, went in the three then four path on the turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, edged
to the lead just past forty yards from the wire and held off a late challenge. SELL BABY SELL was unhurried early, shifted in heading into the turn going in
the two to three path on that bend at the rear, angled eight wide coming to the furlong marker, rallied strongly but just missed. INDIAN DIVA was bumped at
the break, switched out at the half, went five wide on the turn, made a bid about fifty yards from the wire but was outfinished. ADORABLE BRITTANY was
forwardly-positioned inside vying for the lead, dueled around the turn, had no extra to kick on with the top ones but beat her sparring partner. LITTLE
VALLEY GIRL bumped the inside foe at the start, was strongly urged forward to contest the pace between runners, dueled outside three two to three wide
on the turn, weakened in the stretch. BUCA SARABI was unhurried early, went five to six wide on the turn swinging nine deep into the drive and gaining but
could not sustain the effort in the lane. CARMON'S DANCE settled inside, failed to rally. BULLY BABY contended between runners early, dropped back
from four wide shifting in to be two wide on the turn and did not threaten thereafter. MISS LUBBOCK was forwardly-positioned outside runners early, went
five then four wide on the turn, dropped back and faded.
