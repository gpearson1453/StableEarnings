Footnotes
GRACE FOREVER settled off the pace and the inside early, moved closer in the three path late in the final turn, challenged on the outside entering the
straight, long drive to the wire, proved narrowly best in determined fashion while remaining widest at the wire. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE also raced in mid
pack early, closer inside the winner late in the second bend, between foes upper stretch, angled in, inside bid, not enough to be outkicked in the late going.
RACY JAYCEE away well, allowed the early leader to go, chased that one up the backstretch, advanced and took over in the second turn, briefly clear into
the straight, gave ground grudgingly late to the top two while between that pair at the finish. KATIE'S KARAT restless in the gate just prior to the start,
hopped in the air at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, trailed for over a half, improved position with some mild late interest outside.
CALIFORNIA KATIE sprinted well clear the opening quarter, maintained a sizable advantage up the backstraight, offered little resistance to the winner when
confronted by that one far turn, faltered when headed. DEVIL WITH A DASH lacked speed in racing back early, failed to muster a rally when called on.

Footnotes
TAPIT RIGHT tracked the pace from along the inside, firmly in hand and in traffic turning for home, roused when clear, bid between foes past the furlong
marker, late duel closest to the inside, proved best in determined fashion. FIRSTSLATE never far back outside, challenged three wide turning into the
stretch, dueled late outside the winner, outfinished, clearly second best. MY LITTLE FIRE back off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn,
staged a mild rally to be up late for the show, no threat to the top pair. MAVE RUNNER showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, vied into the
lane and began to weaken, caught late for the show spot. C C CROWN'S CHOICE in tight at the start, pressed the issue early in the two path, with the first
flight between horses into the stretch, faltered.

Footnotes
FOURSWEETNIECES behind the pace along the inside early, continued to save ground turn, asked along late in the bend then roused once in the stretch,
shifted out bit when taking aim on the leader approaching the furlong grounds, closed with good resolve to be up in time. JOE G'S PAYBACK broke alertly,
soon cleared to the inside, set all the pace, continued to hold a daylight advantage late, could not contain the winner while under firm handling in the final
stages. BIND ME UP within striking distance after breaking with the runner up, raced in even fashion out of the turn and through the stretch, came back for
the show late while not a threat to the top two at the wire. I'M ALL MIXED UP chased the leader up the backstretch, remained closest to that rival through
the turn, began to gradually weaken when straightened for home, caught late for the show. GILDED APPLE back off the pace and the inside, came four
wide out of the turn, lacked a closing punch. KICK N KISS last away, trailed most of the way in failing to threaten. DIAMOND FOR CRIDER finished after
three furlongs, continued to back up stretch, trailed across the wire, pulled up short after the finish and was vanned off.

GHOST COWBOY last away, moved up to race in the second flight turn while along the inside, boxed in along the rail late in the turn, continued to wait into
the stretch, split foes, finished fully of run to be well clear at the end in a solid effort. RITHMICALLEA lacked speed off the inside, was four wide late in the
turn and into the straight, angled toward the inside nearing midstretch, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. WILLIAM
GUSTAVO moved up after the start to set the pace inside, continued to show the way turn, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker then proved no
match for the winner nor could he contain the runner up, saved the show. BOSTON BENBOW dueled up front off the inside, also steadily weakened in the
run to the wire, outkicked for the show. DRIFTER fell back to trail after the start, failed to menace. YOUNG TUSCAN forwardly place for three furlongs
outside, gave way.

Footnotes
TRIBUTE GALAXY headed up the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground turn, shifted out a bit when straightened for home when going
after the leader, collared that one just inside the furlong marker and drew clear under steady handling. ENDURING PEACE in the second flight while three
wide and outside the winner, set down for the drive, could not keep with that rival in the run to the wire, up late for the place. TYPHOON ZING broke on top,
cleared to the inside, set all the pace until headed the final furlong, continued to weaken after overtaken by the winner, caught late for the second spot.
CAJUN SHOTS raced back off the pace, improved position without posing a serious threat to the top three. LAST DESTINY in the main body while racing
inside, lacked a closing response. MISSGREELEY'SSONG remained back in failing to threaten. BE A BANDIT raced in mid pack while racing outside, had
little for the drive. A WISH FOR MADELYN bothered at the start, trailed early as a result, was four wide out of the turn, jogged in to finish well back.

Footnotes
EZEE ENOUGH in the second flight while racing outside, moved closer four wide late in the turn, set down for the drive, furious handling late, up late.
MADISON'S PLACE away in good order, vied up front three wide, lost some ground to the leader turning for home and under the crop, rebid between rivals
late, missed in a game effort. D'WILD BARONESS vied early between rivals in the run up the backstretch, dueled turn then gained a larger advantage inside
the runner up entering the stretch, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, responded when confronted by the top two late, gave ground
grudgingly to that pair, remained clear of the others. WHOLESHACKSHIMMIES lacked early foot, came five wide into the lane, displayed a modest amount
of late interest while remaining well out in the strip. D'WILD MUFFIN in the second flight while racing off the inside, between horses into the lane, went
evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA fractious while reluctant to load, dwelt the hopped at the start to spot the field
several lengths, remained back and was never a factor. JENNIFER'S ARCH flashed brief early speed along the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
KING LIAM in the second flight inside, continued to track the leaders through the turn, moved closer in traffic while in the two path past the furlong marker,
floated in by MR. PRODUCTION nearing the gap to tighten SMOOTH COLLIERRY up along the rail nearing the sixteenth mark in deep stretch, dug in late
to prove narrowly best in determined fashion. PRIZELESS raced back off the pace outside, three wide into the lane, rallied and lodged an outside bid late,
missed while widest of the first flight at the wire. MR. PRODUCTION used a bit to make the early advantage inside, dueled through the turn closest to the
rail, came out under a single right handed crop inside the furlong marker, came out again under a left handed crop nearing the sixteenth pole as TOUGH
CHARLIE was coming in, exchanged bumps with that rival resulting in him coming in to float KING LIAM into SMOOTH COOLIERY into tight quarters along
the rail resulting in that rival to steady and fall back, outkicked in the late going while between the top two at the wire. TOUGH CHARLIE broke alertly, set or
forced the pace outside of MR. PRODUCTION, continued to vie into the stretch, came in to exchange bumps with that same rival with just over a sixteenth
of a mile remaining setting off a chain reaction of interference, weakened in the late going. SMOOTH COLLIERY behind the pace, moved closer along the
inside past midstretch, was put in tight quarters, steadied then was wrapped up on to fall back and lose all chance. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SMOOTH COLLIERY AGAINST MR. PRODUCTION
AND KING LIAM FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE SIXTEENTH MARKER, THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH STOOD.

Footnotes
ITS A WRAP took command after the start inside, set a legit set of early fractions under a light hold, let out a notch while in the two path late in the final
bend, rebroke and drew off through early stretch, maintained that comfortable advantage to the wire under continued steady handling. BOYFRIEND
MATERIAL settled off the pace along the inside, behind the winner into the far turn, improved through that bend to chase that foe into and through upper
stretch, no match the final furlong, all out late to hold the place. RIGHTANDJUST void of speed for five furlongs, steered out to be five wide turning for home
when beginning to advance, finished willingly while well out in the strip to be getting to the runner up late. NATE'S ATTACK devoid of speed while off the
inside, four wide into the far turn, fanned six wide into the stretch outside of RIGHTANDJUST, could not match strides with that one the final furlong to finish
up with only a mild amount of late interest. MAGA MAN chased the winner early, moved closer before a half, could not keep up through the final turn and
came up equally empty for the stretch run. LEMNISCATE within striking distance early, fell back before a half and went one paced thereafter in failing to
seriously menace. SECRET COURIER four wide when just off the pace through the first turn, continued outside and was four wide again when moving
closer into the final bend, flattened out in the drive. BOLD THIRST within striking distance off the inside, tired after five furlongs. MISCHIEVOUS BULL five
wide when with the main body into the first turn, bobbled early in that bend, promptly pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
BESTIEVERHAD vied early on the outside, shook clear in the turn, continued to hold a comfortable advantage past the furlong, held the runner up safe in
the late going under steady handling. ACHANCETOWIN chased the winner from along the inside, continued to pursue that one through upper stretch,
slowly closing the gap in the late going, well clear for the place. GRACE'S VISION last to leave, void of speed, continued to lag into the lane, rallied up the
inside to annex the show, no match for the top two. D'LADY FIRED UP within striking distance off the inside for three furlongs, came up empty for the drive
to finish up evenly. FROIDEUR went one paced throughout to also be found lacking when the real running began. FEATHERINHERHALO failed to menace.
TANTALIZING TEN remained always back, trailed home in showing little.
