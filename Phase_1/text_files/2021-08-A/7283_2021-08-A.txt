Footnotes
WILLSHERWONTSHE broke readily, angled to the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into the bend, shook clear nearing upper stretch
and widened late under firm left handed encouragement. DANZIG STAR, urged prompting a rival's pace from the outset to the turn, couldn't match that foe
racing into the lane but continued with interest to save the place honors. LAURA N LUKAS tracked the pace outside a rival as part of the second flight racing
to the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and was outkicked for second. RABBIT TWENTY TWO tracked the leaders inside foes in second
flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. GRETA'S CASPIAN hesitated at the start to lose contact with the leaders and never gained
contention. UPTOWN JERSEY GIRL, off a bit slow while being carried out a bit at the start, dropped out early.

Footnotes
SHE B GLAMOROUS was rated off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, awaited an opening nearing upper stretch, shifted about in traffic nearing
the furlong marker, split foes then angled to the rail to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm handling. LULUMARU, pulling between foes in the
opening stages, tracked just off the first flight along the inside under rating to the second bend, was urged through close quarters bidding for command
between foes while exchanging some contact with EBONY BAY racing into upper stretch and contested the issue grudgingly to the end to just miss.
SUNDEREYA settled last racing to the backstretch, swung out four wide nearing upper stretch and continued willingly to gain terms with the top pair while
just outkicked. EBONY BAY tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to advance shifting three wide entering the far turn,

THAT'STHEWAYTODOIT, urged inside foes to gain the advantage entering the backstretch, dictated the pace along the rail on a narrow margin to the far
turn, dueled into upper stretch and gave way. BADGERI CANDY, caught five wide in early stages, prompted the pace in the three path to the far turn and
emptied out.

Footnotes
FORTY NINE MODEL was hustled up inside rivals to gain the advantage after the opening quarter, dictated the pace into the turn, forged clear nearing
upper stretch and held sway through the lane under firm encouragement. BLAZING CHARM tracked the leader between foes, made a steady effort to gain
second on the turn but proved no match for the winner. REMARKABLE CHARM settled between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside leaving the
turn and continued with an effort to improve position. DISTINCT APPROVAL, off a bit slowly, switched outside foes to race four wide into the turn but offered
no closing bid. CHEVERIE, off a bit slowly, never gained contention. LA ROSA DRIVE, urged pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, emptied out early.
SWEET TATUM tracked off the first flight three wide between foes racing to the turn but faded early.

Footnotes
WILD BEHAVIOR broke readily, angled inwards pressing the pace outside a rival to the turn, edged forward to a clear advantage while angling inside
entering the stretch and maintained the advantage under firm handling. SAMURAI CAUSE broke outwards bumping DON'T FORGET, was settled between
foes, then along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out to split foes midstretch, then angled to the rail in late stages to narrowly prevail for second while
closing the gap. ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke readily, dueled for command inside the eventual winner in the opening stages, conceded the lead entering the
turn, tipped out in upper stretch while being roused to re-engage the winner and just missed for second. MAKE ME BLUSH tracked off the first flight outside
foes racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into the stretch and continued evenly late. DON'T FORGET, bumped at the start, switched out five wide
in the opening stages while being prompted to a forward placing, was urged three wide into the turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but came up
empty entering the lane. EUROMANTIC tracked off the first flight inside foes and faded into the stretch. TIGER THE MAN dropped out early.

Footnotes
DEVIL VISION, broke inwards, was reserved last racing well off the field in the opening five furlongs, shifted off the inside to split rivals just off the inside
racing into upper stretch, then angled to the rail midstretch and continued with a steady late response to bid for command in the final stages to narrowly
prevail in time under firm handling. TWOKO BAY tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, came through when presented an
opening in upper stretch to gain the advantage between calls late but couldn't fend off the winner. FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM, firmly rated between foes in
the opening stages, continued under reserve along the inside to the second bend, shifted out to split foes three deep in late stages but was outkicked by the
top pair. KINETIC SWAGGER, forwardly placed inside rivals in early stages, pressed the issue on the far turn into upper stretch and gave out late. SUPER
CONSTITUTION angled inwards to gain a narrow advantage between foes racing to the backstretch, dictated the pace between foes to the far turn and
faded in the drive. D C HERO tracked off the first flight three wide between foes in early stages, switched out nearing the far turn, was caught five wide
through the second bend to the lane and had no late kick. BOURBON WISDOM angled in, tracked just off the first flight between foes to the second bend,
was caught in close quarters nearing the lane and quickly came up empty. AMERICAN MADE, caught four wide in early stages, moved to prompt the pace
three wide to the far turn and emptied out. CHEST CANDY, caught four wide in second flight racing to the backstretch, faded after a half.

GRAND SLAM HOMERUN, urged inside foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, shook clear racing into the turn, then held sway to the end under
firm right handed pressure. ULTRA CORDIAL, bumped at the start, settled into stride dropping well off the leaders, split foes three wide racing through the
stretch and narrowly prevailed for the place honors. ALOTTA SOUL tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, saved ground to upper
stretch and continued with a steady late response while being outkicked for second. DROP O' CHOCOLATE tracked off the second flight outside a rival
racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into the lane and was just outfinished for a share. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE switched outside foes early
dropping off the second flight, was fanned five wide racing into the lane but offered no rally. PEARLE DE VEENE, urged three wide prompting the pace,
gave way into upper stretch. ROOMANTICS CHA CHA settled outside foes racing to the turn and failed to menace. AKSARBEN SUMMER broke awkwardly
while bumping ULTRA CORDIAL, settled last outside foes and failed to menace thereafter. JANET'S ROCKET, urged between foes prompting the pace to
the turn, continued in pursuit of the winner to upper stretch, then was taken up in the closing stages while under distress and was vanned off the course
following the race.

Footnotes
TIN BADGE was rated outside rivals in second flight racing to the backstretch, pulled his way to position tracking just off the leaders to the second bend,
shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady late response to wrest the advantage and go clear in time under firm handling. EL TIZAR
broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin along the inside to the backstretch, held sway to midstretch but proved no match when confronted by
the winner. BRING ME A CHECK, forwardly placed stalking just outside the pacesetter racing to the far turn, was prompted to challenge racing into upper
stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SUMMER ASSAULT angled inwards while being reserved between foes tracking off the second flight, shifted three
wide into the lane and continued evenly between foes to late stages. IM A COWBOY TOO angled to the inside stalking just off the pacesetter racing to the
backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch but had no closing bid. AUBEY RIDGE settled inside foes dropping off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, swung outside foes to race four wide nearing upper stretch but had no closing bid. FIREMAN OSCAR, reserved last from the outset to the far
turn, split foes just off the inside in late stages but made no real impression. HOT SHOT KID was rated off the second flight along the inside to the
backstretch and faded inside foes into the stretch. NOBLE PURSUIT, off slowly, settled outside foes in the last flight and faded from contention early.

Footnotes
WARREN'S WISH, forwardly placed tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, continued with a steady bid to wrest command racing into the
far turn, then kicked away through the stretch under firm encouragement. WEE MS. BURNZIE switched outside rivals early gaining a position off the second
flight, was prompted to advance three wide racing into the far turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others. SHAY'S GLORY settled
outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance four wide racing into the far turn, shifted inwards racing into the stretch and continued well
enough to prevail for a share. ORTS DREAM settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, altered course avoiding tight quarter nearing
upper stretch, clipped heels racing into the lane but recovered to display some late interest. TANTIMA tracked off the second flight between foes to the far
turn and faded into the stretch. LUCKY MAC was hustled to the lead along the inside, set the pace into the backstretch and gave way racing into upper
stretch. THAT'S ALL RIGHT, pulling while caught in tight quarters along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the backstretch, faded after a
half. TEMPLES MON CHERI settled inside foes racing to the backstretch and dropped out early.
