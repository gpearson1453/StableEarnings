Footnotes
CASCADE BILLY tracked the pacesetters from the four path, moved up closer into striking position nearing the quarter pole, drove four wide then rallied
outside and prevailed under a drive. SMARTY RIVER PANTS rated off the pace from the two path, drove three wide into the lane then angled in sharply to
commend a rail bid, gained a narrow advantage in the final sixteenth and was bested in the final strides. ZICATELA stalked the pacesetters from the three
path, swung out near the three sixteenth marker, improved outside and was along in time for show. SOLO RING dueled for the early lead inside of DEUCES
ARE WILD and flattened entering the stretch. DEUCES ARE WILD vied outside for the early lead, dueled outside of SOLO RING and left little in reserve for
the drive. SIR BRONX lacked a bid. BAR NO Q offered little.

PADDYSDAYCHARM attended the pace from a rail position, gained a slim advantage over J. CRUZ at the three sixteenth pole and held under pressure. J.
CRUZ contested the pace from the three path, was set down for a drive but was unable to get by the winner in the stretch. AMIGO QUERIDO showed good
inside speed early, dropped back through the turn and closed with good energy to earn show. STRONG AND FREE lacked early speed and was outkicked
for show. JUST CLYDE chased the pacesetters in second flight and faded through stretch. JIMMY FLASH sent for early speed, pressed the pace from
between, was unable to move on with rivals after the quarter pole and tired.

SASSY BUT CLASSY brushed away from the gate, chased the leader wide in the backstretch, asked to quicken nearing the quarter pole, was set down for
a drive at the head of the stretch and prevailed under a drive. TRICKY SPEEDSTER hustled outside, raced wide leaving the backstretch, bid steadily
outside through the stretch then was all out late and just missed. FIRST BASE chased the early pacesetters, moved up alongside BIG Z to challenge the
lead at the five sixteenth pole, chased under steady urging through stretch and inched up for show after a multi horse scramble to the finish. LIL'MISS
INTAGLIO loaded without rider, squeezed out leaving the gate, trailed the field through the turn, circled into the lane and closed gamely outside just missing.
BIG Z broke alertly then led the field through the turn, responded to challenge from FIRST BASE and was wore down deep stretch. DANZA UNBRIDLED
chased outside to the opening turn and failed to menace in the drive. FRAN FROM PERU outrun throughout. YNOTGIVEITAGO broke in bumping into
LIL'MISS INTAGLIO then stumbled, checked at the three eighths pole and retreated. DRAGON WING raced mid pack and tired into stretch.

Footnotes
IMPOSING CAT prompted the pace from the rail, responded to encouragement into the rail, pushed clear of IRISH GOLD and held under a drive. FINALLY
GOTTCHA tracked the pacesetters from the three path, hung coming off the turn, continued bid outside and was along in time late for place. SOUTHERN
WARLORD rated off the pace in the four path, bid belatedly getting by late for show. POWER OF INTENTION unhurried early, gained steadily inside and
finished on the wire at the same time as IRISH GOLD. IRISH GOLD stumbled leaving then quickly crossed over to set the early pace, rallied determinedly
into the stretch and gave way grudgingly just holding fourth position. PACIORETTY failed to improve through stretch. PROOF IT clipped heels leaving and
was outrun. REGAL CANDY offered little.

Footnotes
VISION QUEST broke sharply, saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, responded to challenge from LONE PIONEER, dueled into the
lane then was overtaken, fought back inside late stretch regaining the lead and prevailed after a long drive. LONE PIONEER tracked four wide into the
backstretch, moved up alongside VISION QUEST at the three eighths pole, dueled through the final turn then gained a slim advantage but was unable to
hold off the fore mentioned late stretch. WISER TIMES sat in striking distance from the rail, commenced a bid with three furlongs remaining, moved up
menacingly at the quarter pole while three wide and evened out through the stretch. PATRICK trailed the field early and offered a mild late bid. GUNN WITH
THE WIND unhurried early, chased into the lane and was unable to improve position. HUERFANO G. showed little. BRESLIN sat just off the pace under a
snug hold, was unable to keep pace with the field leaving the backstretch, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
PLUM BLUE settled in stride the raced four wide through the opening turn, trailed the field through the backstretch, advanced quickly outside, drove three
wide then gained the lead at the head of the stretch and won driving. IT'S ALEXUS reserved off the early pacesetters from the four path, moved up quickly
nearing the three eighths marker then swept the lead, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and had to settle for place finishing best of the others. NICE
BROWN GIRL stalked the dueling pacesetters, moved up closer leaving the backstretch, split rivals into the far turn, chased into the lane then drifted out,
kept on under urging and was able to hold on for show. TEMPLE OF ZOOM raced four wide into the opening turn, chased in the final turn and yielded. LA
CHICA DE FUEGO raced at the back of the pack while three wide and lacked a bid. IRISH LUNA dueled through the opening half and faded steadily inside.
TOP DEMON saved inside, commenced a bid along rail into the far turn and was outrun. KENTUCKY ROLL was quickest to the turn, dueled for the lead
outside of IRISH LUNA, dropped back leaving the backstretch and was done early. TIMER MALFUNCTION- No quarter time available due to timer

Footnotes
ADMIRAL VANNGO rated off the pace from the four path, dropped back in the turn, coaxed entering the lane, rallied inside late stretch and narrowly
prevailed. BONANZA CREEK lagged early, chased through the turn, closed gamely outside through the stretch and just missed. IGNITE THE MOON
attended the pace while four wide, pressed from between rivals through the turn, responded to urging into the stretch and caught. OUR MONEY CAT trailed
the field early, lodged a late bid into the stretch, lacked running room inside and was out kicked. PERDITION contested the pace racing four to five wide,
rallied four wide into the lane and gave way in the final sixteenth. KICKEN WEST G. quickest leaving the chute, contended the pace from just off the rail,
rallied inside through the final turn and left little for reserve for the drive. TANGERINE TAXI sat just off the pacesetters, raced three wide into the far turn,
angled out leaving the final turn and flattened in stretch. WHODUNIT tracked inside, swung out into the lane and was unable to sustain the bid that was
needed. SMALL TOWN DUDE saved ground early on rail and failed to menace. COASTING GHOST hurried away then was shuffled back leaving the chute
and tired.
