STRIKEITORTAPIT lagged back to far turn off rail, rallied three wide past the quarter pole, roused to go well clear. TO KALON chased leader to quarter
pole, dueled, stretch, no match. TABACADABRA had an awkward start, inside trip to far turn, steadied along far turn, altered course to outside but was
outkicked after a terrible trip from the start. DATZA FIVE OH between horses first turn, dropped back, improved position late. MAN DOWN was off slow
outside and never threatened. NINJA sprinted off with a long lead to the half, stopped readily.

no late gain. JUST FINE BY ME inside with good position to far turn, faltered in the stretch. BEAV'S BOO never factored. TRADITIONAL ARCHER always
