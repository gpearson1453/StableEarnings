ALPHA CHI RHO dueled two wide throughout and was narrowly best after a long hard drive. HIDE THE RANSOM took turns on the front while inside the
winner but wasn't enough. PALATIAL TIMES lagged to the stretch then made a late run outside. DANZAFIED chased the top two to the stretch then
weakened. ANNAMATED MOON was slow early, stayed out from the rail around the turn, swung out while rallying into the stretch and tired. MIDNIGHT
HAULER raced the three path and failed to matter.

BEYOND THE BEND rallied four wide around the turn, took over after a half and held after a stiff drive. FIRE'S FINALE moved to vie three wide between
horses on the turn but couldn't get by the winner. D T GOODIE was caught in tight while in good position along the rail nearing the end of the backstretch,
fell back, swung out leaving the turn and regained position. ATHELSTANE had position two wide between horses on the turn, loomed a threat into the final
furlong but came up empty. LITERALLY moved clear from the outside after a furlong, angled to the inside and weakened in the lane.
