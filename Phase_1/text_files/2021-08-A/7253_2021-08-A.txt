Footnotes
CANDY ZIP pressed the pace of CODE CHARLIE while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead
nearing the quarter and was ridden out. MIKE MAN'S GOLD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, was no match for
the winner in the drive but clearly second best. CODE CHARLIE set a pressured pace from the inside for a half and weakened. MISTER MCLEAN showed
no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

a clear lead and was ridden out. PIN UP LADY chased the pace of I WANT ONE while racing four-wide, could not match strides with the winner but was up
for the place. I WANT ONE sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong. JUPITER S. lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GOLD SUPPLY showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach

SKEEMIN N DREAMIN was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and was ridden out to be kept to task.
PAT'S GOLD tracked the leaders from the inside, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was up for the place. IN THE VAULT broke sharply to press
the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to engage the foe nearing the quarter and gave way. PAISLEE'S PULPIT lacked early speed,
raced off the rail through the turn and finished evenly late. ASEAAWINNER was off a step slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and
failed to menace. ONLY DANIELLE chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going a half.

OMACHE KID was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with CREST DRIVE and proved best in
the stiff drive. CREST DRIVE was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the three-sixteenths pole,
vied and just missed. TURNAROUND pressed the pace of CREST DRIVE while racing four-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-sixteenths pole
and gave way. TUMAC MOUNTAIN lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. HOT ENCOUNTER was void of early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not menace.

ANATOLIA tracked the pace of CURIOUS SENSATION her stablemate, from the inside, angled out in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards.
CURIOUS SENSATION sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace, responded when set down for the drive but could not resist her
stable-mate in the final yards. LA UNA lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished with good courage.
ZIPPIN SEVENZ broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and wakened through the final furlong. CAMDEN HIGH showed no early speed,
saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. YOU GO GIRL chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

COUNT ALEXEI broke sharply to duel for the lead with HAYNESFIELD HIT from the inside, opened a clear margin into the lane and held SPARKLING
LUTE safe late. SPARKLING LUTE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with
a steady rally. MARK MY WORD lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with some late run. PREMIER LEAGUE was off slow,
raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a belated bid. HAYNESFIELD HIT was
away in good order to dispute the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half. TIGER ON THE PROWL was void of early
speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SYNSKY was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, weakened and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
GREY POINT sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, increased his margin into the stretch and was ridden out. BEX broke slow and
inward, raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid to gain the place. OXBOW PARK was reserved just off the
leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. HE'S BANDIDO was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and
was not a factor. COWBOY CAUSEWAY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. TIEMPO DE ORO showed brief
speed and weakened. JAZZ STORY lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
