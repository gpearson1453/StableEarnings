Footnotes
DAUFUSKIE ISLAND brushed with a rival at the start, showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, drew even with the leader in the two path on
the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, shook clear under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, switched to a left-handed crop into
the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. WHO HOO THATS ME broke a half-step slow then brushed with a foe, chased the pace on the outside
then three wide on the turn, made a bid under the crop into upper stretch, chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the
place. AVA K'S BOY broke in and bumped with a foe then brushed with another rival, chased the pace on the inside of an opponent, tucked in behind the
leaders at the half-mile pole, chased in the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch and weakened but held the show. JUGGLER bumped with
a rival at the start, was hard ridden off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch under a drive and failed to rally.
AGGREGATION raced towards the rear of the field, departed the backstretch in the three path, lugged out four then five wide on the turn and failed to
threaten. DROSEL DIEM was reluctant to load, brushed with a rival at the start, was urged along in the back half of the field, saved ground on the turn and
failed to threaten. GIMMEDAMONEY broke very fast and went straight to the lead, set the pace under pressure from the outside, vied along the rail while
inside of the winner on the turn, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped back in upper stretch and faded. KNIGHTLY MISCHIEF was ridden
along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. CONVERTIBLE FREEZE was slow into stride, dropped well behind early while
lugging out some, angled in near the nine-sixteenths, lugged out five then six wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
CANDY FLOWER coaxed from the gate, tucked to the inside as LAGOM tucked to the two path with just inside one mile to run and forced a trio of rivals in
behind to steady off her heels, rode the rail through the first turn and tracked the front while along the inside patiently handled until placed to light coaxing
near the quarter pole, got set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command inside the eighth pole and inched away to the finish to
prevail. WHIMSICAL MUSE attended the leader in closest aim while just off the inside, advanced through the latter portion of the far turn latching on to apply
pressure to LAGOM before taking over the front spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared inside the eighth
pole, fought on to the finish to be along safe for the place honors. FIVE ALARM ROBIN got steadied off the heels of CANDY FLOWER with one mile to go in
tandem with a pair, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out to the three or four path
near the eighth pole and ran on to secure the show honors. LAGOM coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths when under challenge for the initial time to the outside, yielded the front and cut the corner into upper stretch, then weakened in the
drive. BLUE ATLAS got steadied off the heels of CANDY FLOWER with one mile remaining, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. FLASHING RED brushed the near side stall at the start getting away last and
conceding about two lengths to the front, got put in tight and was steadied off the heels of rivals due to pressure from CANDY FLOWER tucking to the inside
nearing the first turn, saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DANCING KIKI was hustled to the lead, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way through sensible fractions, was asked under heavy threat from two
foes while in the two path on the final turn, shook clear under a right-handed crop into upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop while extending the
advantage into the final furlong, drew off under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a brisk hand ride to the wire while much the
best. MAIDEN BEAUTY was hustled from the break, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under urging inside the five-eighths,
advanced to make an outside bid in the three path on the final turn, spun four wide into the stretch under a drive, drifted out under a left-handed crop around
the three-sixteenths and proved no match for the winner while able to get the place. MRS. ORB dropped back behind the other four contestants early then
angled in, settled on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused inside on the far turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, was driven
five wide into the stretch, moved further out around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. ESPRESSO SHOT was
coaxed from the gate, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into
the stretch then moved further out around the three-sixteenths and had nothing left. SIMPLY RAVISHING went around the first turn in the two path, tracked
the pace down the backstretch, made a bid between horses in the three path while under urging on the far turn, had the rider lose his crop at the
quarter-pole and faltered then was eased late but walked off.

Footnotes
LIGHT IN THE SKY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits
uncontested, remained patiently handled as SPUNGIE latched on outside near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch roused for the
stretch drive, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well and safe to the finish. CHOCOLATE COOKIE struck the near side stall at
the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, tipped out a path a furlong out and ran on to
secure the place honors. SPUNGIE two to three wide in pursuit, advanced three furlongs from home to latch on the eventual winner to the outside near the
five-sixteenths when put to coaxing, swung four wide into upper stretch, got shaken off near the eighth pole and kept on clear for the show honors.
MISCHIEVOUS DREAM three then two wide in pursuit, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths remaining, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
KREESIE three wide through the first turn, tracked the leader under rating three then two wide, began to back away through the latter portion of the turn and
went four wide for home now behind rivals, then weakened through to the finish.

KEY POINT was urged along on the outside then four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a strong hand ride, drifted out when put to a
left-handed crop in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, drifted out while shying again under a left-handed crop near the furlong marker then was straightened
by the rider, surged to the front shortly thereafter then powered away under a strong hand ride to prove much the best. HAPPY HAPPY B chased the pace
on the outside then three wide on the turn, gained to take the lead at the quarter-pole, dropped to the two path while battling outside of SURPRISE BOSS in
upper stretch, led into the final furlong then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no match while able to get the place. SURPRISE BOSS was
hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure from the outside, vied along the rail while inside of a foe on the turn, lost the advantage into the stretch,
fought on with the runner-up into the final furlong then weakened but was far clear for the show. WICKED BOBBY stood in the gate at the break and was off
slow, spotted the front a few lengths, dropped well behind the rest of the field, gained in the two path on the turn, shifted three then four wide late on that
bend, was driven five wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. KENNY HUSTLE drifted in at the start, was urged along while
skimming the rail, saved ground on the turn, came off the rail in upper stretch, drifted out late and failed to respond. PEPE'S PRIDE settled well off the pace,
was roused leaving the backstretch then urged in the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out and also failed to
respond. COZZY'S ATTITUDE was ridden along towards the rear on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was
no factor. HOT ROD RUMBLE came inward at the start while hustled, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into
the stretch and faded. SILVER SAMURAI was urged along towards the front, rounded the turn in the two path, was driven three to four wide into upper
stretch and capitulated.

Footnotes
DUFRESNE brushed the near side stall at the start breaking towards the top despite it, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from
PIMENOVA to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch under challenge, drifted out slightly at the
three-sixteenths and then again coming to the eighth pole which in turn forced PIMENOVA to alter outwards slightly at that station, dug in under a drive and
drifted out three paths under left handed encouragement and held on on the wire between a pair of late surging rivals. CRICKET WEST coaxed from the
gate, chased three wide in pursuit from mid pack coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
was bumped solidly by CLASSIC LYNNE in a chain of bumping begun by PIMENOVA near the eighth pole, surged late to just get up by a nostril for the
place honors when threatening for it all in the final jumps. MY CARA MIA MINE tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, dug in under a drive in behind PIMENOVA and advancing when that rival drifted out and made brushing
contact with CLASSIC LYNNE causing a separation in the wall of rivals, inserted herself right into the seam attempting and succeeding in prying it open
through jostling bumps and brushes, had PIMENOVA come outwards altering slightly as DUFRESNE drifted near the eighth pole and was bumped solidly
into CLASSIC LYNNE forcing that rival to get a piece of CRICKET WEST at that station, dug in under a drive offering up a late surge inside the eventual
winner and was just nosed out for the place honors. CLASSIC LYNNE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from just off the pace coming under
coaxing three furlongs from home, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was bumped solidly by MY CARA MIA MINE due to pressure
from PIMENOVA at the three-sixteenths, got bumped lightly in jostling moves and was leaned on when suddenly bumped solidly by MY CARA MIA MINE
and in turn bumped CRICKET WEST due to pressure from PIMENOVA once more, this time reacting to the drifting out DUFRESNE in front at the eighth
pole continued on now clear of the fracas and offered up a mild bid for the last major share. PIMENOVA prompted the pace of DUFRESNE from the outside
in the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, drifted out bumping CLASSIC LYNNE and opened a seam
between foes slightly, then altered out as DUFRESNE got to wandering safely in front near the eighth pole and bumped MY CARA MIA MINE solidly into
CLASSIC LYNNE and in turn that rival into CRICKET WEST, then weakened in the late stages to the wire. LADY OF THOROTON three wide at the tail of
the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and altered over the heels of
ADVERSITY just inside the eighth pole, then improved position to the finish. ADVERSITY just off the pace three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing three
furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch in behind a wall of rivals and was paused in behind as bumping ensued, then weakened to the
finish. SKYWARD PRINCESS three wide in pursuit from mid pack, got coaxed along three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered no
kick. RCAPTIVATING just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, continued just off the inside for home and
made no impact. HELENS SPIRIT just off the pace just off the inside in pursuit, came under coaxing midway on the turn, went three wide into upper stretch
and tired. There was Jockey's Objection by the rider of CLASSIC LYNNE alleging interference against MY CARA MIA MINE as well as a Stewards' Inquiry
into the stretch run. After review the objection was dismissed and the result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
TAKE IT OFF was hustled to the lead, dictated terms while inside through the turn, responded well when set down into the stretch then came under a
right-handed crop around the three-sixteenths and drew off under strong urging to win at big odds. MALIBU LUNA settled near the middle of the field, went
two to three wide on the turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole, chased the winner under the crop into upper stretch and proved no match while clear for
the place. HOLLYWOOD GINA tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened
while able to get the show. GAGLIANO bumped with an opponent at the start and was last away, settled at the rear, was urged three wide on the turn,
drifted out near the furlong marker and improved position without threatening. ON A TOUR bumped with a foe leaving the chute, settled on the outside,
angled in inside the five-eighths, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, swung six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HEY
IT'S TATI settled on the outside towards the front, was roused four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. LOVE ME
TOMORROW settled in the front half of the field, dropped back along the rail on the turn and came up empty. SWEETER bumped with a foe at the start,
bumped with another opponent leaving the chute, settled towards the rear, came under some urging around the five-eighths, went five wide on the turn,
came eight wide into the stretch and was no factor. NICKY SCISSORS settled off the pace, was urged along leaving the backstretch, went four wide on the
turn, came seven wide into the stretch then moved in around the three-sixteenths and failed to respond. TRAFFIC LANE was forwardly placed on the
outside, went three wide under urging on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
LETMENO dueled inside of SHOPLIFTED from the get go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths joined three deep by CHOCOLATE BAR, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive edging away to the finish kept to task. SHOPLIFTED dueled from the two to three path with the
aforementioned foe to his inside, came under coaxing between rivals at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive running on to
secure the place honors. CHOCOLATE BAR four wide down the backstretch just off the duel up front, tucked three wide through the turn advancing on that
pair to latch on three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish to be along
for the show honors. BRIEFCASE BULLY coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under
urging from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MIHOS coaxed from the gate, was devoid of speed early on
growing detached at the tail of the field while just off the inside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went four wide into upper stretch and made
mild gain while unable to impact the top spots. MOJOVATION hustled from the gate, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the
inside through the turn under coaxing from midway, swung four wide at the head of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ITSAKEYPER settled off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the inside, was roused outside the quarter-pole, came out
into upper stretch, rallied to make a bid outside of the pacesetter before the furlong marker, gained the lead under a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong urging. GET THE CANDY showed good speed from the outside post, angled in while going to the front, controlled
the action while inside on the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, lost the
advantage to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole, fought on to the wire but missed while clear for the place. UNCLE'S GEM acted-up just before the gate
opened and was off slow, moved out then advanced under urging, went three wide on the turn, brushed with a foe while driven four wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed kick while just able to get the show. ATHENA DANCER was urged along while last but one, traveled around the turn in the two path, was
driven four wide into the stretch, passed foes into the final furlong, drifted in under a right-handed crop near the sixteenth-pole and just missed the show.
MOSIENKO bumped solidly with a rival at the start, bumped with foes on both sides early, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the turn, came five
wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. SNICKET bumped with a rival early, settled on the far outside, was carried from the five path to the
seven path by a lugging out FRACTORZATION on the turn and failed to respond. PROPER GRAMMAR bumped solidly with foes on both sides at the start,
bumped with rivals on both sides early then was taken up while pinched back, angled in at the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.
CANARSIE ANGEL was well placed while rated just off the pace, drafted inside early on the turn, was given her cue while shifting to the two path at the
five-sixteenths, brushed with a foe while cornering three wide into the stretch and came up empty. FRACTORZATION broke out and bumped with PROPER
GRAMMAR, bumped again with that rival early, moved up under urging, lugged out from the four path to the six path under heavy left-rein pressure on the
turn and faltered then was not urged while protected in the stretch. SHESASUPERFREAK was hustled from the start then raced just off the pace, chased in
the two path on the turn, dropped back into the stretch and faltered.

issue a challenge inside the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, then inched away to the finish to prevail. ABAAN bumped at the start by NO
BURN, who broke outwards, raced three then two wide through the first turn before tracking from just off the pace three then two wide, advanced on the
leader through the far turn and spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat, got collared at the
sixteenth marker and ran on willingly for the place honors. GROUP HUG coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside from mid pack coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out four wide into upper stretch and closed well to secure the show honors. I AM THE LAW broke in at the start and
was corrected, chased just off the inside until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and improved position to secure the last major share. NO BURN broke out at the start bumping ABAAN, tussled briefly with DINNER BELL before
establishing the front to shake away in hand along the inside, throttled down the pace midway down the backstretch as the field took closer order, came
under some pressure through the far turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch let out for the drive, dug in under threat, got collared near the eighth
pole and weakened to the finish. COMPLICATE two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch
and passed tired rivals to the finish. RHYTHMIC RULER three then two wide through the first turn, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. INCITATUS
two to three wide in pursuit under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. DINNER BELL tussled briefly with
NO BURN for the front before easing off to settle just off the inside in closest aim of that leader, came under coaxing tucked inside at the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside for home and tired. ROYAL TRYST coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cut the
corner into upper stretch and made no impact. SEMPER FIDELIS just off the inside through the opening bend, chased four paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then just off the inside through the far turn, went four wide for home, folded and was not persevered with to the finish. L'ARTISTE spun five
then four wide into the first turn, took the overland route five to six paths off the inside throughout and faltered.
