Footnotes
WILD LOOKER tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, made a steady gain and edged
up late. ABBEY'S SNOW WHITE allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed late kick.
MALARKEY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin through the turn, then weakened late and held the show. RICKEY'S GIRL
well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and flattened out. LACEE mid pack, looped four wide
through the turn, bid five wide into the lane and weakened. AMAZON LIZZIE improved her position, widest. BLUEGRASS CANDY ran evenly.
CONQUESTHARDCHERRY stalked the pace on the outside and faded after a half.
