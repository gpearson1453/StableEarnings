Footnotes
SILVER CRESCENT (GB) jumped well while reserved under tight restraint, stalked the leading duo while asked on the final turn, gained to make a bid
between horses coming to the furlong marker then burst clear as his most likely challenger missed the final cone and vacated the race to prevail. KERI'S
FIND (IRE) moved up at fence four to take the lead, jumped well setting the pace, was asked on the final bend, battled under a drive into the final furlong
and was outfinished but gamely earned the place. PERFECT TAPATINO (FR) was rated under a vigorous hold, made a bid near fence seven, was asked
near the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong and was also outfinished then just missed the place but was clear for the show. RITZY A. P.
was rated in tight quarters between foes on the first turn then steadied late on that bend, traveled three to four wide from that juncture, was urged along after
fence seven and lacked the needed response. CHETZERON (FR) bobbled landing over fence one, stumbled landing over fence two, was reserved off the
pace, dropped well behind on the final turn and was eased but walked off. WITHOUTDESTINATION (GB) struggled some over the fences while rated on the
inside, chased into the stretch for the final time, attempted to make a bid on the inside after passing the eighth-pole, failed to make it around the final cone at
the sixteenth-pole and vacated the race. LEMONADE THURSDAY took the early lead while jumping well, lost the advantage over fence four, dropped back
after fence six and was pulled up but walked off.

Footnotes
COUSIN ANDREW was under a rating hold four then three wide behind foes down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, spun three
wide for home and was awarded for his patience with a seam to daylight, got roused on through and rallied to take command near the eighth pole, then
edged away to the finish to prevail. MACH ONE hustled from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the front, advanced to apply pressure through the
turn and swung four wide into upper stretch, seized command straightened away, got collared near the eighth pole and ran on to chase the winner home
clear of the rest. LEADING WEST hustled from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and
improved position for the show honors. REMEMBERMOM prompted the pace three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, took over
command inside that station already under pressure from MACH ONE to the outside, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and yielded the front
straightened away, then weakened to the finish. NAPOLEON COMPLEX bobbled at the break, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just
off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. WE BE THERE stumbled at
the start, chased four to five wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued four to five wide for home and tired. DEMURO hustled from the gate,
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from three furlongs out, went three to four wide into
upper stretch and tired. OKIE ROUGHNECK hustled from the start, showed the way in hand from the two path under pressure from a pair, came under
coaxing near the three-eighths, yielded the front inside that station and cut the corner into upper stretch, tired and was eased through to the finish, then got
pulled up and vanned off after the finish.

by a foe and forced in, settled towards the rear on the inside, swung five wide into upper stretch, moved in late and got up for the show between horses on
the wire. LEVIOSA was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner into

Footnotes
IFIHADACHANCE just off the pace in pursuit along the inside, remained patiently handled until set down angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command nearing the eighth pole, tussled briefly with the runner up before inching away to the finish kept to task. COFFEE BAR traded a bump at the start
with FAIR LASSIE, chased three wide advancing midway on the turn to issue a challenge through the latter portion of the bend, swung five wide into upper
stretch, dug in latched on the aforementioned foe until shaken off inside the final sixteenth and ran on clear for the place honors. ELECTRIC YOUTH saved
ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside for home, tipped out near the three-sixteenths and
nudged and brushed with ENOUGH LOVE nearing the eighth pole, kept on to secure the show honors. PENDOLINO four then three wide into the first turn,
crossed to settle along the inside in hand showing the way through sensible splits, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for
home, yielded the front inside the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages. FAIR LASSIE traded a bump at the start with COFFEE BAR, chased
two to three wide in closest aim of the leader, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. ENOUGH LOVE four wide
into the first turn, tucked three then two wide through that bend before chasing two to three wide from that juncture, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in
under a drive and was nudged nearing the eighth pole by ELECTRIC YOUTH tipping out and made no impact.

Footnotes
SPORT MODEL was taken in hand early then carried five wide into the first turn, dropped to the two path midway through that bend, settled towards the
back, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied outside while put to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker
and closed well to get up in the final stride. FUNWHILEITLASTED angled three wide into the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, came under coaxing
leaving the backstretch, made a bid in the two path at the five-sixteenths, took over into the stretch, shook clear under a right-handed crop into the final
furlong,

BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY was caught four wide on the first turn then rated on the outside, came under urging leaving the backstretch, chased three wide
on the far turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth and finished willingly for the show. BIG TIME LADY traveled around the first turn
in the two path, was reserved at the back then roused three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to rally.
SHOW ME THE HONEY was taken in hand while dropping back in tight quarters between foes early, pulled under restraint into the first turn, saved ground
while rated off the pace, was asked on the far turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and came up
empty. SHESADIRTYDANCER broke out but came out in front then was quickly corrected, was taken under a snug hold while going to the front, set the
pace on an easy lead while dropping from the two path to the rail, came under pressure on the final turn, lost the lead into upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TOWERING ORBIT coaxed from the gate, tussled briefly with a pair before establishing sole command to show the way lightly coaxed along from the two
path, came under a drive near the quarter pole and drifted out five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting out another path a furlong out
before coming in under an off side crop near the sixteenth pole getting a bit leg weary and under growing threat to the inside and lasted at the finish. I'M
PERFECT TOO got bumped between foes who each broke her way and was squeezed back at the start and forced to steady getting her stride broken and
off balance and conceding six lengths to the front, raced six paths off the inside growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked three wide five furlongs from
home and gave chase two to three wide through the turn steadily making ground from the three-eighths pole to the quarter pole, spun three wide into upper
stretch, closed well inside to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth latching on the aforementioned foe as she hit the wire while well clear of the rest
showing good courage after a rough beginning. VIVAZANO hustled from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide
into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors. SHAMALAMADINGDONG coaxed from the gate, chased three to four
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun six to seven wide into upper stretch and had the rider pause putting his charge under a protective
quick grip while stealing a peek at the right front side, continued on under light urging and came up empty. TASSI broke out at the start bumping and
squeezing back I'M PERFECT TOO in concert with FANCY FELINE, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at
the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. FANCY FELINE broke in at the start mugging I'M PERFECT TOO in tandem
with TASSI, chased five then four wide under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, went nine wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CHRISTOPHER was urged along on the far outside, went four wide on the turn, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the
furlong marker then drew away under steady urging. BIG WONDER was sent hard from the start, chased the leading trio from fourth, traveled around the
turn in the two path, was driven five wide into the stretch and finished willingly for the place while no match for the winner. DETERMINED FURY was
bumped in the hindquarters early, settled off the pace, went three wide while roused on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then gained, moved out
under a drive near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response while up for the show. THING disputed the pace on the outside of two foes then in
the three path on the turn, led into the final furlong, was swallowed up by the winner shortly thereafter and weakened. WILD WILLIAM was fractious in the
gate, bumped with DETERMINED FURY early, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, moved out while
closer to the front in the vicinity of the furlong marker but failed to respond. OUR DESTINY was a bit restless in the gate, showed good speed, contested the
pace between rivals, vied in the two path while still between foes on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. MONTAUK DADDY bumped
with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of two opponents, vied along the rail while still inside those foes on the turn, came out into the
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. CONVECTION bumped with a rival at the start, settled towards the back, saved ground on the
turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
BAYERNESS just off the inside in pursuit from just in behind the leader, tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut
the corner into upper stretch and had AUNT KAT take to the rail nearing the three-sixteenths, tipped out near the eighth pole, forcing WHISPERING PINES
to be taken hold of, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish kept busy to the end. AUNT KAT coaxed from the gate,
raced forwardly placed early on before advancing to take command six furlongs out, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing near
the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home before taking to the rail at the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat, got collared at the sixteenth marker
and ran on to just preserve the place honors. CASUAL hustled from the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to just miss for the place honors. WHISPERING PINES showed the way early on before being
displaced by AUNT KAT six furlongs from home, settled four then three wide in aim of that rival coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three
wide for home, came in slightly forcing BRONX BEAUTY to steady at the three-sixteenths before being steadied herself near the eighth pole as
BAYERNESS tipped out off the rail, then weakened in the late stages. HONOR WAY chased along the inside and suddenly pulled a bit eager and was
steadied off the heels of BAYERNESS half a mile from home, remained off that rival closely and was given her head by the rider to allow her vision to guide
her to settle through the turn while just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home and offered no response. BRONX
BEAUTY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide in close aim coming under coaxing just outside the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, got steadied as WHISPERING PINES came inwards and was in tight inside that rival and outside of BAYERNESS, then weakened through to the
finish.

L'IMPERATOR (FR) bumped with EVER DANGEROUS at the start, bumped again with that foe early, was reserved in the two path, shifted four wide late on
the far turn then was roused, rallied to get the lead in upper stretch, drifted in a bit into the final furlong, shook clear into the final sixteenth and prevailed
under strong urging. EVER DANGEROUS bumped with L'IMPERATOR at the start, bumped again with that opponent early then checked sharply while
squeezed back between horses, was reserved at the back while saving ground, shifted three wide when asked around the five-sixteenths, moved to five
wide outside the quarter-pole, followed the winner under a drive into the final furlong and finished with good courage for the place. EN WYE CEE broke out
at the start, was taken back off the pace under tight restraint then rated just behind the leader in the pocket, drafted behind horses while still under restraint
on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, lacked room from that point into the final furlong while under some urging, checked sharply when a possible
hole closed inside the eighth-pole, gained momentum when finding room into the final sixteenth and finished with good energy for the show but lost any
chance at the victory. BODECREAM raced in the three path on the first turn, settled nicely down the backstretch, was given his cue in the three path on the
far turn, gained under the crop to make a bid in upper stretch, battled with the winner until the sixteenth-pole then was out-kicked. BURNING BRIGHT
brushed with a foe at the start then leaned on that foe a bit, was taken in hand while going to the front, showed the way under a snug hold on the inside,
was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage to the winner inside the three-sixteenths and weakened. ARGONNE was taken
in hand early, rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, chased under the crop into
the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. PRETTY GOOD YEAR went three wide on the opening bend, was unhurried at the back,
came under urging late on the backstretch, went three wide early on the far turn, was carried five then six wide late on that bend, dropped back five wide

KITTEN BY THE SEA came out at the start brushing THEODORA GRACE and pinching out EVIDENCE BASED against ROSE E HOLIDAY, established
the front and showed the way in hand along the inside under the watchful attendance of HOHOHOHO to the outside, tipped to the two path through the far
turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive shying out a bit two paths under a
near side crop, got corrected and dug in to hold safe to prevail. HONOR HOP bumped at the start by BE UP, who broke outwards a step, tracked the pace
along the inside coming under urging with seven-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch in behind the leader, tipped to the two path
straightened away, dug in under a drive running on willingly through to the finish to chase the winner home, cutting into her margin inside the final sixteenth.
OCEAN AIR three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide from mid pack, came under urging just inside the three-eighths pole, angled out five
wide into upper stretch, kicked on belatedly with a trio and got the nod for the show honors. COME STORMING struck the off side stall at the start and was
away a half a beat slow, then got checked in tight and in behind BE UP as HONOR HOP tucked directly in front nearing seven and a half furlongs to run,
tracked the pace along the inside from near the rear, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied into
prominence a furlong from home and offered up a mild kick to get the bob for the last major share. CLADDAGH'S RUN three then two wide through the
opening bend, settled just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under encouragement three furlongs from home, angled out five to six wide into
upper stretch and offered up a mild bid but was outfinished in the last jumps in a blanket finish for minor spoils. BE UP broke out a step at the start and
bumped HONOR HOP, had that rival tucked directly in front nearing seven and a half furlongs remaining and was forced to steady off her heels forcing
COME STORMING to check in behind along the rail, tracked the pace along the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, bid into contention a furlong out, dug in under a drive flattening out in the very late stages and was outfinished.
EVIDENCE BASED got bumped and pinched out at the start due to pressure from KITTEN BY THE SEA , who came outwards, raced three wide through
the first turn settling near the rear, remained three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing just past the five-sixteenths,
went seven wide at the head of the stretch and offered no kick. THEODORA GRACE bobbled at the break slightly and was brushed by KITTEN BY THE
SEA coming outwards, grew rank under restraint off the heels of that rival early on and then another foe through the midway point on the first turn before
settling three then two wide in mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun four wide for home and was in behind a rival at the
three-sixteenths tepidly engaged by the rider, altered in a path a furlong out roused and backed away. ROSE E HOLIDAY broke a beat slow and lost her
lane at the start, saved ground at the tail of the field briefly altering outwards when both COME STORMING and BE UP were forced to lose some
momentum by HONOR HOP heading to the rail just prior to entering the first turn, made her way back inside, tipped to the two path through the far turn
coming under motivation three furlongs from home, went three wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact. SWEET FRANNY LU forwardly placed
three wide through the first turn, settled three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch in range of the leader, went three wide through the turn
placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. HOHOHOHO forwardly placed just after the start, settled just off the inside
attending the leader to the outside under a light rating hold, remained patiently handled in closest aim of the leader until called upon with five-sixteenths to
run, cornered three wide into upper stretch and tired in the drive.
