Footnotes
DANCING TIL DUSK bobbled at the break, raced slightly off the inner rail on the far turn, swung to the four path at the head of the stretch, advanced outside
horses to take command in mid stretch and drove clear. RUNNING ON ENTRY hugged the inner rail stalking the pace, found room inside horses to
challenge for the lead in mid stretch then weakened in the drive. WOLVERETTE , three wide chasing the pace around the far turn, gained the lead in upper
stretch and weakened late. BLESS AND HONOR stalked the pace, advanced in the two path on the far turn, failed to keep up, swung to the four path in mid
stretch and weakened. SEVILLA SANGRIA , quickly clear, set the pace along the rail, drifted out turning for home and tired. MISS MORENO , three wide on
the turns, was not a factor. MYSTIC COMIN HOME trailed.

Footnotes
SIR LENNY broke a bit slow, quickly recovered and angled off the inside when advancing around the first turn, stalked three to four wide, moved up then bid
three deep into the far turn, dueled outside MONYINTHEBANKSEY from the five sixteenths, battled on a slim lead under left handed rousing past the eighth
pole, shook clear late and was taken in hand the final jumps. MONYINTHEBANKSEY , bumped at the break, sprinted clear early and set a rated pace
slightly off the rail, was joined past the five eighths, dueled inside foes from the half mile marker to the five sixteenths, emerged in a tussle with the winner
from there, fought on gamely but wasn't quite good enough through the final fifty yards. SUPPORTING ACTOR settled in the clear, edged up while three to
four wide into the far turn, gave hard chase of the embattled leaders past the five sixteenths, circled into the stretch but could only muster up a mild kick.
STAND MY GROUND , bumped at the break, lagged off the pace, circled five wide into the lane but failed to menace. MANKLIN CREEK was taken back
soon after the break, saved ground and failed to threaten. ROCKIN RON came in at the break bumping a rival, corrected and stalked two to three wide,
went up to engage the leader leaving the five eighths, sparred between runners leaving the far turn, failed to keep pace into the stretch and faltered.

LECTRIC CHOKE settled off the rail, was under heavy pressure three wide past the three eighths, moved up some into the lane, swung out past the three
sixteenths, made a grinding run to the outside of THREETHEHARDWAY and got up in the final jumps. THREETHEHARDWAY saved ground while
unhurried past the five eighths, eased out advancing into the lane, closed in under a drive and collared the leader with a furlong to go, held the advantage
inside the sixteenth pole but just failed to contain the winner. MY SACRED PLACE was sent up between foes into the first turn, stalked four then three wide,
edged up to join the winner around the far turn, dueled, took a short lead past the five sixteenths, maintained that lead past mid stretch then faded late.
SHAKA STYLE sped clear early, set the pace in about the two path, met a challenge leaving the half mile marker, battled around the final turn to about mid
stretch then gave way. FIND YOUR BOAZ saved ground without factoring. VICTORY GIVEN , forwardly placed three wide, was under pressure leaving the
far turn, failed to kick on and dropped back.

ONE LAST TRIAL hugged the inner rail disputing the pace with TRAFFIC SONG for five furlongs, asserted herself and opened a clear lead mid way on the
far turn, drifted wide entering the stretch and was kept to her business in the drive. I LOVE YOU , three wide the first turn, stalked the pace, circled the far
turn three deep, chased the winner through the stretch and was second best. TRAFFIC SONG disputed the pace outside the winner, failed to keep up on
the far turn and weakened turning for home.

MYSTIC TIMES , away alertly and got into a forward position, tracked to the inside of rival nearing the half mile pole, eased out a bit and took closer order
after a half mile, bid four wide to engage the leader past the three sixteenths, dueled and drew clear under a drive. CONFUSION BABY BOY sped clear
early, set the pace off the inside, was collared in upper stretch, dueled past the furlong grounds and gave way grudgingly in the final sixteenth. AMEN
CORNER lacked speed, raced three wide while under asking past the quarter pole, angled out and rallied mildly. SMART STEP , three to four wide early,
dropped in through the drive but came up empty. TICKER TAPE PARADE broke a step slow, advanced inside mid turn, angled out and gave way. PROUD
ENOUGH flashed speed, chased three wide leaving the three eighths, failed to kick on after a half mile and retreated.

DANCE WARRIOR lacked speed, saved ground on the turns, remained along the inner rail through the stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and
drew off. RUNAWAY MONET , along the inner rail stalking the pace, steadied on the heels of SUGAR SNAP 1/16, angled out and rallied. SUGAR SNAP ,
quickly clear, set the pace slightly off the inner rail, angled to the five path in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and weakened. FACTOR IN
chased the pace, circled the far turn, was fanned six deep turning for home and gave way. DREAM ABOUT ME , inside horses on the far turn, swung to the
five path in upper stretch and gave way. ALPHA ZULU , four deep the first turn, remained widest down the backstretch and retreated on the far turn.
