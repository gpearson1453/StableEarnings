Footnotes
THEALLIGATORHUNTER, bumped from both sides at the start, was urged to dispute the pace inside a rival racing a bit off the rail to the first turn, shifted to
the rail nearing the backstretch dueling for command, continued in a protracted skirmish to upper stretch, was bumped lightly approaching the furlong
marker by MINNESOTA MIRACLE, shifted out despite right handed pressure making solid contact with that foe nearing the sixteenth marker came under
correction from his rider and maintained a narrow advantage to the end under pressure. MINNESOTA MIRACLE broke inwards making light contact with
THEALLIGATORHUNTER, was righted to force the pace outside that rival racing to the backstretch, dueled for command to upper stretch, shifted in
bumping that rival, then was bumped while being knocked off stride nearing the sixteenth marker and continued to dispute the issue to the end while being
just outkicked. OVERLY LUCKY was rated off the second flight while angling inside racing to the backstretch, shifted out to the four path racing through the
stretch and made a steady late gain to prevail for a share while closing the gap. WATER PATROL tracked just off the first flight along the inside racing to the
far turn, saved ground to upper stretch, exchanged some light contact in late stages and was just outkicked for a share. MAY WE ALL tracked the leaders
outside a rival as part of the second flight, shifted inwards entering the stretch exchanging light contact with WATER PATROL and lacked the needed final
kick. LAST MARTINI broke outwards bumping THEALLIGATORHUNTER, was settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally.
MYSTIFIER settled last in early stages and trailed throughout. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE TRAINER AND RIDER OF MINNESOTA MIRACLE LODGED
CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE ALLIGATORHUNTER WHILE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED A CONCURRENT INQUIRY. AFTER REVIEWING THE
STRETCH RUN, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED THEALLIGATORHUNTER, PLACING HIM SECOND.

Footnotes
ALL NATIVE, reserved in the last flight along the inside, saved ground through the far turn, shifted out to the five path racing through upper stretch and
continued with a steady late response to reel in HURRICAIN HUNTER in time under firm handling to prevail. The latter, in touch with the pacesetter
attending that rival's tempo to the backstretch, pressed the issue on the far turn, edged forward to a clear advantage between calls late but couldn't fend off
the winner. FLASH FLOOD was rated off the second flight along the inside to the far turn, split foes just off the inside racing through the stretch but was
outkicked by the top pair. DREAMING BIZ, reserved between rivals racing three deep to the far turn, was bumped racing into upper stretch, then shifted four
wide late while improving position. WARREN'S WISH sped to the lead, dictated the pace on a narrrow margin along the rail to the far turn, briefly resisted a
rival's bid but gave out in late stages. STYLIN N PROFILIN angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter to the far turn, tipped out three wide in upper
stretch and came up empty late. NORA'S LEGACY tracked just off the second flight between foes, was prompted to advance while caught in close quarters
racing into upper stretch but had no closing bid. BOOZIN AT BOZOS settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to menace. PRINCESA DEL
SOL tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, was prompted to make brief progress three wide nearing the far turn but soon gave way.

Footnotes
DRAMA CHORUS broke readily, dictated the pace along the inside racing to the backstretch, repelled the challenge of several rivals nearing upper stretch
and kicked away racing through the lane under mild urging. ZOE'S DELIGHT was rated off the second flight inside rivals racing to the backstretch, was
urged to advance between foes racing into upper stretch, then shifted to the rail in the closing stages to narrowly prevail for the place honors. GIANT
PAYDAY tracked the pace outside foes in second flight, continued three wide to upper stretch and just missed for second. SHAKES CREEK, bumped at the
start, tracked the pacesetter inside rivals in second flight, shifted out to lodge a brief bid between foes entering the lane but came up empty late. J P
WARRIOR, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to contend, dropped back on the backstretch, then made a second effort to gain
some position between foes late. TWO BY TWO tracked off the second flight outside foes, was caught five wide while being prompted to advance racing
into the far turn and had no closing bid. KID FROSTIE settled along the inside early and failed to menace. BRUDER BOB, bumped at the start, was righted
to track the pacesetter between foes to the backstretch, was urged to make brief bid on the far turn but emptied out in the drive. CHOCOLATEICECREAM
settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and proved no factor. Pending review times omitted and the final was hand timed.

Footnotes
KIERKEGAARD was urged inside rivals disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn, edged clear in upper stretch and was kept to firm
encouragement. PUBLIC SAFETY angled to the inside tracking off the first flight, was urged to bid inside the pacesetter in upper stretch but proved only
second best. ROMAN PHAROAH was urged to terms prompting the pacesetter from the outset to upper stretch, weakened in late stages. MY
DOMINATOR, caught six wide tracking just off the second flight in the opening stages, was prompted to advance four wide to upper stretch but lacked the
needed late bid. DIGITAL STAR settled outside foes, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but made no impact. DEUCE tracked off the first flight three
wide between foes, then faded into upper stretch. HARD TO PARK, caught five wide in second flight, lost position racing into the turn, angled to the rail
entering the stretch but had no rally. SMART CALL bobbled at the start, settled last and never gained contention. STONE SECRET, cut off at the start after
breaking a step slowly, was prompted to gain some position between foes racing to the turn and emptied out in the drive. PRINCE LEO swerved out at the
start and dropped out early. WELL READ proved no factor.

BRUCE'S GIRL, off a step slowly, was rated along the inside in early stages, switched outside foes on the backstretch, was prompted to advance with a
sharp move racing four wide into upper stretch, wrested the advantage and went clear under firm encouragement. SMOKING BOSSA NOVA settled outside
foes racing to the backstretch, angled out four wide in upper stretch and continued with interest between foes to narrowly prevail for the place honors.
BRIGHTSIDEOFLIFE broke awkwardly, then was taken up at the start, settled last racing to the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and
continued with a steady late bid while just missing for second. PINK CHANNEL, in touch with the leaders along the rail prompting the pace, was eased off

Footnotes
BERRY GOOD was prompted to a forward placing while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, conceded the lead while switching outside a rival
entering the backstretch, pulled her way between foes on the backstretch to go clear leaving the five furlong marker opening a comfortable advantage, then
maintained command through the far turn through the stretch while being kept to energetic handling. MISSYINTOMISCHIEF angled inwards to force the
pace outside the eventual winner racing to the first turn, gained the advantage while shifting to the rail racing into the backstretch, switched off the inside
once losing the lead on the backstretch, continued with a steady bid pursuing the winner to late stages but was no match while proving best of the others.
MONGOLIAN LOTUS, forced out avoiding LULUMARU racing into the first turn, settled well out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, was prompted
to advance four wide into the far turn to upper stretch and continued with some interest to gain a share. LADY ASTRID, reserved while shifting out three
wide racing to the backstretch, continued evenly between foes to late stages. GEMSTONE GAL tracked off the first flight while shifting out three, then four
wide racing to the backstretch and came up empty on the far turn. KIMBERLY FRANCES hopped at the start while breaking slowly but never gained
contention. SPUN LINE, urged along the rail racing to the first turn, switched out three wide pursuing the leaders into the backstretch, couldn't match the top
pair after five furlongs and gave way into upper stretch. LULUMARU, under pressure to contend inside foes in the opening stages, checked sharply avoiding
tight quarters while ducking into the path of MONGOLIAN LOTUS entering the first turn, and dropped out early. DO YOU BILEVE angled to the rail tracking
the leaders from out of striking distance to the backstretch and emptied out racing into the far turn.

WINNAGER tracked the leaders three wide in second flight in early stages, made a steady advance in that path racing into the turn, angled inside the
pacesetter to challenge for command in upper stretch, wrested the advantage leaving the furlong marker and went clear under firm encouragement. PEAK
OF CHIC, forwardly placed tracking just outside the pacesetter, advanced to press the issue racing into the turn, gained a brief advantage racing into upper
stretch but proved no match for the winner while prevailing for the lace honors. FADED ROSE, caught in close quarters at the start, settled last while angling
to the inside racing to the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a mild bid to prevail for a share. KNIGHT'S HONOR tracked
just off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted outside a tiring rivals racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. TWO DRINK MINIMUM
tracked off the first flight between foes and continued evenly to late stages. VIKKIS ROCKSTAR sped to the lead along the inside in the opening stages,
dueled for command through the turn and gave out racing into upper stretch. TIZ TENACIOUS hopped at the start while brushing a rival, was settled outside

HOT ARTIE broke sharply, dictated the pace a bit off the inside racing through the backstretch, held sway on a clear margin to upper stretch, ducked out
under left handed pressure leaving the three sixteenths marker but came under correction to maintain a narrow advantage under firm encouragement to
narrowly prevail in a game effort. DEVOTED TO YOU, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter racing to the turn, tipped outside that
foe racing into upper stretch to challenge, altered course when momentarily losing his path to bid inside the winner midstretch but was just outkicked. HAS
THE GLORY, off a bit slowly, settled between foes near the inside, then continued with a steady effort to improve position between foes to late stages while
prevailing for a share. BOOM TRUCK, under pressure in early stages tracking just off the second flight, saved ground to upper stretch but had no final kick.
