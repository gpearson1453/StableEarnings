NO SENSE lagged back four wide, two path on the turn, angled out, asked, gained to take the lead late and was going away. STRIKING MIKE away on top,
vied for the lead off the rail, took the rail on the turn, kicked clear a furlong out but could not handle the winner. PEAK'N POOK in hand along the rail, two
path midway around in search of room, took the rail, appeared blocked at the top of the lane, waited, angled out, asked and hung. UNWAVERING contested
the lead along the three path into the turn, two path out of it and was done. GOT TO LIKE IT in hand along the three path into the turn, continued on that
path, asked and weakened.

GRUDGE away best, showed the way along the two path and then widened to be ridden out. OUCH THAT HURT stalked along the two path, two path on
the turn, angled out and finished well to best the rest. ANSELMI never far back along the three path, angled out some and then was no match for the top
pair. DOSAGE AND MIMOSAS four wide on the turn and then failed to gain. CHASING LOSSES tracked along the rail early and tired inside.
COMFORTABLE CAT stumbled badly at the start spotting the field four lengths, five wide on the turn, was outrun. BANKERS BEAST saved ground and

SIMPLY unhurried along the three path, two path into the last turn, three path around it, angled out, reached contention a furlong out and bested
INALIENABLE for the win. INALIENABLE RIGHTS set the pace along the two path around the turns, was collared by the winner, battled on and finished
gamely. YOUR AWESOME BOSS tracked along the three path on the turns, dropped back some in the lane and then passed faders. LADY'S GOLDEN
GUY well placed in hand four wide, gained on that path into the lane and hung. TOMMY THE TORCH saved ground well placed and tired. ANYTHING
PAZIBLE broke sluggishly, three path early, six wide after a half mile, angled to the rail on the last turn and tired. BEACHSIDE saved ground early, five wide
after a half mile, four wide on the last turn and tired. PADDY ALL DAY broke slow, four wide on the first turn, six wide up the backstretch and was done on
the last turn.
