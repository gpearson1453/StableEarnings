Footnotes
NOBLE MISS exchanged a very light brush at the break, pressed the pace inside of rivals but off the fence, took a narrow lead entering the turn then was
challenged by an inside foe, retook command two wide nearing the three-sixteenths, was kept to the task. CLOSING TIME CUTIE moved forward along the
rail to prompt the leader entering the turn, had a brief lead on that bend, was no match for the winner. TIZ MY HOUR exchanged a very light brush at the
start, raced in behind foes up the backstretch switching out about the three-eighths, went four to six wide on the turn, ran on evenly in the stretch. DR.
MINISTER was bumped at the break, raced in the two path on the turn in behind the leaders and failed rally. SHELL GAME contended between runners
early, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and continued to weaken. FLAMING BESITOS prompted the pace from outside, went four to five wide on
the turn and weakened. BRASS COUNTY bumped the outer rival at the start, saved ground and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
IRISH RHYME was intent on the lead from between runners, dueled outside a foe two to three wide on the turn, edged clear into upper stretch and held
sway while being kept to the task, was vanned off. NO DOUBT was bumped shortly after the break, urged forward, dueled inside the winner but was no
match. INFINITE CROWN shifted in heading up the backstretch, raced two then three wide on the turn and ran on to be best of the rest. DOUBLEDOWN
DREAMER was in tight quarters between rivals leaving the backstretch, steadied and altered out near the three-eighths, went six wide on the turn, drifted in
under right-handed urging in mid-stretch and kept on evenly. CAUSING CHAOS broke open the gate pre-race, was in a bit tight leaving the backstretch,
moved out from four to seven wide on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. CHROMATIC JAZZ bumped the inside rival soon after the break, moved
out a bit leaving the backstretch to chase three then four wide, failed to rally. QUICK LAUGH chased initially from outside, began to drop back five wide on
the turn and continued to weaken. DIABOLICAL TURN chased briefly four wide and between runners into the turn, steadily dropped back and came up
empty.

B A CHAMPION exchanged a bump at the break but quickly moved forward to dictate terms, saved ground on the rail through the turn, was clear into upper
stretch and just held under steady handling. RIGHT JAB chased the winner from outside, went four wide on the turn, was asked for run outside the quarter
pole, gained steadily but slowly in the lane and just missed. COMING ABSTRACTION settled mid-pack, advanced two then three wide into and on the turn,
was within contention leaving the turn but flattened out. C D POLDARC broke outwardly, shifted in and saved ground inside on the turn, gained steadily but
needed more. SANDIA'S BEST was forced in after the break, settled at the rear racing just off the inside, went in the three path on the turn, angled six wide
into upper stretch and ran on. BRIEF WHO exchanged a bump at the break, chased briefly from the two path, came up empty. WHISKEY STRAIT was
forced out at the start, chased the leaders briefly, dropped back in the four path on the turn, tired.

Footnotes
RUN LIKE KATE set the pace from off the rail initially in the two path then in the three path heading into the far turn, was shaken up at the head of the
stretch and held sway. PARTYATTHECAPITAL tracked the pace from inside, came out three wide leaving the far turn, could make no headway on the
winner. MS. LEA was well-placed between runners five then four wide on the first turn, continued in pursuit from outside runners going five wide on the far
turn, weakened in the lane. ICY CAPE bumped the outside rival at the start, moved in from the three to the two path on the first turn content to stay in the
back half of the field, moved out two to three wide on the far turn, angled outside a rival near the sixteenth pole but had no rally. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE
was caught wide going six then five deep on the first turn, shifted in at the three-eighths heading into the far turn going into that bend in the two path and
moving nearer the rail while advancing by horses, lacked the needed late kick. BLAIRS GAL was unhurried racing inside at the rear, moved out a path on
the far turn before angling out further once in upper stretch, failed to menace. TELLINGLY was caught seven wide into the first turn before easing back and
moving in five deep late on that bend, angled in about the seven-sixteenths but lacking room had to come back out and went three to four wide on the far
turn, was never a threat. ALL STEAMED UP was bumped at the break, chased four then three wide on the first turn, dropped back four to five wide on the
far turn, was eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
SARA'S MEMORIES tracked behind the leader then moved inside that one entering the far turn going in the two path on that bend, applied pressure up the
backstretch racing along the rail into the far turn, drifted out a bit on that bend, brushed OLIVE COUNTY very lightly past the three-sixteenths and again in
mid- to late-stretch with a narrow lead and held sway. OLIVE COUNTY set the tempo into the first turn racing well off the rail in the three path, vied outside
the aforementioned two to three wide on the far turn getting brushed very lightly late on that bend and again in mid-stretch but fought on gamely. KANDI
SPUN saved ground racing mid-pack on or just off the rail, came out a bit in upper stretch and ran on evenly. ITSGOODTOBEKING settled at the rear in
about the three path, shifted inside a rival going from four to three deep on the far turn, improved position. THE PACESETTER switched outside a rival
early, stalked four wide in the early going, began to drop back three wide on the far turn and weakened. CONNIE'S LINDA was hard to load, raced five to six
wide on both turns and was never a threat. FEISTY HALO moved outside a foe from three to five wide on the first turn racing just off the leaders, dropped
back four then five wide on the far turn and could not rally. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF OLIVE COUNTY AGAINST SARA'S
MEMORIES ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
PUNCH OUT tracked along the inside on or just off the rail early, switched out at the seven-sixteenths, made a move three to four wide on the far turn taking
the lead outside the furlong marker, was clear but kept busy to hold sway. MR. NASTY stalked from outside early going three to four wide on the first turn,
took a narrow lead about the nine-sixteenths, edged clear three wide coming to the quarter pole, was overtaken just past the three-sixteenths but kept on
gamely. LEMON ICE set the early pace heading to the first turn moving in to the two path entering that bend, moved nearer the rail, was overtaken heading
up the backstretch and pressed from inside, saved ground on the far turn but weakened in the stretch. SOUTHERN SUMMER broke awkwardly then was
guided outside, stalked four wide on the first turn, moved in a path while losing ground on the far turn and continued to weaken. SOULONG failed to rally
racing mostly in the three path on the turns. SEBASTIAN CAPE lacked early speed racing on or just off the rail, moved out a bit on the far turn going two to
three deep on that bend before coming out further for the drive and was never a threat.
