Footnotes
TOCCETIVE JAC settled inside for nearly five furlongs, was roused on the second bend, responded to steady urging and took over along the rail with
seventy yards to spare under a well-judged ride. SHOBIZ STAR was encouraged to prompt the early leader from just outside, gained the lead when allowed
on the second turn, floated out some entering the lane, tried to hold on through the stretch but did not have enough left. MR. LUV MAKER unruly in the gate,
popped his door open before the start, broke alertly when settled again and the race began, showed the way from inside, did not stay with SHOBIZ STAR
on the second bend, swung to the outside leaving that turn and gradually continued to yield. WOOD NOT MIND soon trailed, stayed off the inside until
reaching the stretch and was never a factor.

MARYS LAST SONG was kept close from outside, moved to a clear lead when asked two wide on the turn, was under a drive from the eighth to sixteenth
markers in the stretch then maintained full control under her own volition. ARCH FLYER rated from inside on the backstretch, commenced her bid behind
MARYS LAST SONG on the bend, took second with two furlongs to go then could only pull away for the place in the lane. ASHLEY ELIZABETH disputed
the pace between horses on the backstretch, took the rail on the turn, began to yield, angled out widest at the top of the stretch, did not respond to urging
and was allowed to coast the last sixteenth.

Footnotes
CYCLONE ATTACK broke on top, showed the way off the rail but inside rivals, was roused leaving the bend then steadily opened up in the stretch while
kept to a drive to the wire. TRUIST broke a bit outward, slammed hard with SAFE and was forced inward, advanced along the rail to move clear for second
on the turn then could only hold his position in the lane. SAFE was slammed hard and forced into TRUIST at the break, settled at the back, gradually angled
out as he picked up his pace through the bend, came widest into the lane and drew off for third deep stretch. STARSOVERPARADISE reluctant to load, was
hustled along at the start to prompt the pace from outside, retreated some four wide on the turn, took the three path entering the stretch and steadily faded.
LAYTON THE DAY bore in at the start, bumping hard with SAFE and was never a factor. ROCKET MAN ATTACK pressed from between horses on the
backstretch but began to fade three wide on the bend. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start but no action was taken after their review.

PRETTY GITA rated from outside, commenced her big widest on the bend, was under a drive through the lane and caught MEETMEINSTLOUIE nearing
the wire. MEETMEINSTLOUIE set a pressured pace just off the inside, moved clear when asked upper stretch, began to wear down with a furlong to go,
gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure and had to settle for second. ABBMAR pressed just outside MEETMEINSTLOUIE, floated out some
entering the lane, failed to have the needed late kick and was altered in to gain a clear path with seventy yards to go. SOUTHERN ATTACK prominent
toward the outside on the backstretch, was two then three wide on the bend then ran evenly the last quarter mile. TIME BREAK in contention early just off
the inside, took the rail on the turn and gave way the final two furlongs. RANGOON ATTACK was a factor along the rail on the backstretch but gave way
with three furlongs left.

GHAALEB'S APPEAL shared the early lead from inside, did not keep up on the bend, came again when put to a drive leaving the quarter pole, edged ahead
inside the final furlong and held sway under steady handling. TIZ HOPPIN bumped at the start, soon gained the advantage from between horses, moved
ahead and stayed in path two on the turn, was challenged from inside upper stretch, drifted out some under left-handed pressure inside the last eighth, was
straightened with a sixteenth left and lacked the extra needed in the waning yards. LOUIE P broke a bit outward, bumping TIZ HOPPIN, was kept close from
outside, three wide through the turn, also drifted out when put to left-handed pressure approaching the eighth pole, was corrected near the sixteenth marker
and could only make up minor ground late.

Footnotes
LEFT COAST DREAMS was kept close along the rail, waited for room while boxed in on the second bend, got through from inside entering the stretch, vied
for the lead, moved ahead as he gradually drifted out despite right-handed pressure inside the final eighth and maintained control. PENALTY SHOT
forwardly placed between horses from the beginning, commenced his bid just outside LEE'S LUCK on the second turn, lacked the extra needed deep
stretch but caught the latter for second near the wire. LEE'S LUCK broke alertly and was sent to get a clear early lead, rated just off the inside on the
backstretch, was let out along the rail on the second bend, floated out some entering the lane, was challenged from inside upper stretch and slowly yielded
as he was angled out to keep a clear path inside the last furlong. CHERNYAHOVSKIY gradually progressed from outside to threaten three wide on the
second turn, drifted out some into the stretch and flattened out. VENKMAN void of speed, though urged along from the early going, showed little.
