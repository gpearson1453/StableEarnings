DIRECT LINE stalked the pacesetter from outside, applied pressure past the halfway point, headed rival with a quarter mile to go, gained the lead leaving
the far turn, cleared entering the stretch and drew off under right-handed urging and steady handling late. MONGOLIAN FORD sped to the front and
controlled the pace near the inside through the early stages, gained pressure up the backstretch, challenged at the quarter and ceded the lead leaving the
second bend, could not go on with the winner in the stretch but stayed on to secure the place. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP stalked the pace from inside then
two wide into the drive and went evenly late for the show. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY tracked off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and weakened.
GONE ROGUE went two or three wide on the first turn, came out into the backstretch, navigated the second bend four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
GRIT AND CURIOSITY unhurried in the early going, angled to the two path for the turn, steered out and bumped rival in upper stretch, rallied in the final
sixteenth and edged PSYCHO DAR in the closing moments. PSYCHO DAR brushed with IAN GLASS early, went up to duel from outside, cleared into the
turn, led through the lane and into the final sixteenth and got caught near the wire. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) steadied briefly between rivals early,
tugged near the inside past the seven-sixteenths, remained inside to the stretch, lacked room along the rail behind PSYCHO DAR, gained a clear path with
a sixteenth remaining and finished willingly for the show. MCWHERTER dueled for the lead from outside, could not match strides nearing the turn, chased
outside a rival around the bend and finished evenly late. IAN GLASS brushed with rival early, chased three wide around the turn, forced out and bumped by
the winner in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BLAME IT ON ROSE vied three deep up the backstretch, cleared inside rivals then got tested again at the quarter pole, responded well and turned that rival
away in upper stretch and inched away. SUPER RENEE stumbled at the start, stalked outside a rival early, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, could
not sustain the momentum in upper stretch and chased the winner to the wire for a clear second. JACRODRA'S DEVIL chased along the inside, went
between rivals at the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the drive and bested the rest. MY SWEET MARY raced in range early off the inside, exited the
turn four wide and lacked further response. DANIEL'S GIRL tracked five then six wide on the turn and failed to rally. SIP SIP HOORAY sat off the pace on
the inside, angled out with a quarter mile remaining and failed to menace. OUTLAW DAISY vied for the lead between foes, chased in the two path into the
turn, moved to the rail around the bend and weakened. AREEB vied for the lead from inside, could not keep pace with the leader into the turn, steadied
briefly along the inside around the bend and tired. KITTYBE QUICK stumbled leaving the gate, trailed off the inside to the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
DENDERA away quickly then ceded the lead to BALL LASS, switch off the inside while closest in pursuit, drew alongside on the far turn, gained command
into the stretch, kicked clear from that rival and drew away under a tap of right-handed urging and strong handlingly. ELEUTHERA was off a bit slow from
the far outside, settled near the back of the pack, lacked room from the five-sixteenths to the quarter pole, angled out and came three wide into the lane,
finished willingly for the place but was unable to threaten the winner. PEPPERMINT FLIRT tracked three deep through the early stages, chased two wide
into the drive and finished evenly. HEAVEN'S GHOST was off slow then checked between rivals shortly after the start, trailed in the early going, angled five
to six wide leaving the far turn and kept on to round out the superfecta. BALL LASS sped clear and crossed over to the inside, gained company on the far
turn, relinquished command at the three-sixteenths pole and gave way. ABHITA traveled in mid-pack early on from inside, moved out to the two path on the
backstretch, got crowded between rival in upper stretch and weakened. ASSUNTA got bumped from outside at the start, raced outside a rival then angled
four wide leaving the second bend and lacked further response. PEACEHAVEN broke in and bumped rival at the start, was a bit rank between foes on the
first turn, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch and faded. BIG FAME stalked on the inside early on, dropped back on the far turn and tired.

NEXT REVOLT vied between rivals into the first turn then dropped back to stalk the pace, waited behind the top trio on the far turn, tipped out into the three
path, steered to the inside in upper stretch, rallied inside AMERICAN DANCER and drew clear. AMERICAN DANCER stalked off the inside, went up outside
the top pair nearing the far turn, vied for the lead three deep then took over past the five-sixteenths pole, moved clear into the stretch, challenged inside the
furlong grounds and yielded to the winner. BOYSON trailed early, advanced through the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally and
gained the show. INVICTATATUS vied four deep into the first turn, chased the leader into the backstretch, applied pressure from outside, vied for the lead
between foes on the second bend, lost contact past the quarter pole, was impeded and checked hard off the heels of NEXT REVOLT and was outfinished
for the show. QUESTION AUTHORITY vied three deep into the first turn, cleared leaving that bend, set the pace up the backstretch, vied with a pair of rivals
into the second bend, could not keep up with a quarter mile remaining and faded in the stretch. LIAM'S PRIDE was in tight along the inside early on the first
turn then pulled a bit off heels, came five wide into the drive and lacked a rally. STREET BEHAVIOR vied for the lead from inside then chased QUESTION
AUTHORITY leaving the turn, started to weakened around the far turn and had little left for the drive. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS

MISS CAROUSEL settled off the pace, moved down to the rail, angled four wide nearing the stretch, rallied five wide in the drive and drew clear under hand
urging. SHYLOCK EDDIE tracked the pace from inside then two wide into the lane, lacked room behind rivals from upper to mid-stretch, gained a clear path
in the final sixteenth and dug in for the place. ACAI chased outside a rival early on, exited the turn four wide, launched a bid with a furlong remaining but
faltered late and lost the place. SUPER GAME got crowded between rivals at the start, angled to the inside, moved off the rail and came three wide into the
stretch, angled out in the lane and rallied belatedly. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA tracked outside a rival, angled five wide leaving the turn and failed to produce a
bid. FIREPROOF chased on the inside through the turn, slipped by rival along the fence in upper stretch but could not find the needed late kick in deep
stretch. RAIN DIVA off alertly in the beginning, pressed from outside, pulled and was rank at the seven-sixteenths, chased the leader through the turn, bid
outside and gained the lead in upper stretch then weakened in the late stages. SQUARE PEGGY set the pace under pressure, cleared at the three-eighths,
led two wide into the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
JOE DON LOONEY got bumped from inside at the start, attended the pace three deep, chased the top pair three then four wide on the turn, came back on
the final furlong and overhauled CATBERNAY late. CATBERNAY vied for the lead from inside, dueled with HALF RIGHT through the turn and into the
stretch, cleared rival inside the furlong grounds and yielded grudgingly in deep stretch. WEDDING GROOM traveled in mid-pack early on, went five wide
into the turn, six wide entering the stretch, finished well but could not threaten the top pair. GOLDENEYED stalked off the inside, took the turn four to five
wide and finished evenly in the drive. HALF RIGHT broke out and bumped rival at the start, vied for the lead between rivals, dueled around the turn and into
the stretch, battled to the eighth pole and weakened. AWESOME BEACH stalked the top trio up the backstretch, saved ground chasing the dueling pair
through the turn and could not offer the necessary response to left-handed urging in the lane. HOT PASTRAMI sat off the pace in the early going, got
floated out by CHASING FAME into the stretch and lacked a rally. ASHLEY'S VALENTINE traveled off the pace outside a rival, took the turn three then four
wide and never threatened. CHASING FAME settled on on the inside, angled out into the lane and failed to menace. CIBERTRUCK went two wide into the
turn, four wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CREW DRAGON pulled behind the lead on the inside on the first turn, stalked the pacesetter to the quarter pole, tipped out to two path leaving the bend,
rallied three deep in the final furlong and bested HOCKEY DAD in the final sixteenth. HOCKEY DAD sped to the front from inside, pressured on the
backstretch, dueled around the far turn, fought back into the stretch, battled down the lane and finished gamely to the wire. BARRAZA settled off the rail,
angled four wide into the stretch, shifted in past the eighth pole, then closed well four deep late and earned the show honors. WAR MACHINE stalked in the
two path then moved up to press the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn, vied between in the final furlong and got outkicked. NUMERO DIX (GB)
was off slow to begin, tucked inside early, tipped out and given his cue at the top of the lane, summoned a mild late bid but failed to threaten the major
placings. COTOPAXI (IRE) traveled outside a rival off the pace, exited the far turn four wide and lacked a rally. LAKER MAMBA was in tight or lacked room
and steadied into the first turn, rated in mid-pack on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and never rallied. THE HULK (GB) raced in ranged outside a
rival, put in a mild bid with a quarter mile remaining, could not sustain the momentum leaving the turn and weakened in the drive. SWISS SWOO (IRE)
tossed his head and hopped at the start, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace.
