MINESHAFT MAGIC edged up between rivals near the five eighths and stalked the leader, was under asking chasing past the five sixteenths, bid four wide
outside ACADIAN GIRL soon into the lane, kicked clear under strong left handed rousing the held sway. LADY FOX lagged two wide, dropped in towards
the rail entering the lane and finished well to gain. CAR LADY , well back saving ground, raced three wide into the stretch, shifted out past mid stretch and
had a mild response. MAVILUS , three wide past the seven eighths, stalked three wide outside rivals past the five eighths, came under strong urging leaving
the far turn, chased to mid stretch then came up empty. ACADIAN GIRL cleared into the first turn, set the pace towards the rail, was put to urging leaving
the five sixteenths, drifted three wide into the lane, failed to resist the winner past the three sixteenths and weakened. IMAGINE VICTORY saved ground in
a forward spot, failed to kick on under pressure around the final turn and faltered.

Footnotes
CIARRAI ABU steadied when in close while saving some ground and forwardly placed leaving the three quarter pole, edged up inside a rival near the half
mile marker, waited into the far turn, angled out then chased between past the five sixteenths, altered out leaving the three sixteenths, closed determinedly
under pressure and got up to be on even terms at the wire. MAYFIELD OF DREAMS rated off the leader early then angled out, bid early backstretch, dueled
two wide, inherited the rail around the final turn, met the bid of MY DREAM GIRL and battled from there, shook clear inside the sixteenth pole, kept on
gamely and held for a tie. MY DREAM GIRL stalked three deep past the five eighths, moved up into the far turn and joined MAYFIELD OF DREAMS,
sparred past mid stretch then faded late. LOVE MY CAT settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out into the lane, worked between, dropped in and
had a belated kick. DIXIE'S FASCINATOR , taken to rate, advanced four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, chased the dueling leaders into the lane but
came up empty. SMART ENTRY , wide throughout, failed to menace. CORAL SUMMER broke slowly, raced four wide into the lane and lacked a solid run.
PEACHY BETWEEN US sped clear early and dropped in to set the pace, was joined into the backstretch, dueled into the far turn then gave way. BOB'S
LADY was keen behind rivals and steadied along through the opening quarter mile, stalked past the five eighths, chased between foes past the five
sixteenths then weakened. SARA PLAIN N TALL , pinched back soon after the break, was not a factor. BELLATORA steadied when a bit rank early, saved
ground and dropped back.

Footnotes
ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) broke alertly, quickly sprinted clear, set the pace near the rail and dug in stubbornly the final furlong. SAVAGERY broke a bit
awkwardly, steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, eased out leaving the turn, bid for the lead outside the winner in mid stretch and
continued gamely. AIR ON FIRE , four deep on the turn, offered a mild rally. DAY THE MUSIC DIED , along the inner rail on the turn, failed to menace.
REVOLUTIONARY ROAD , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the stretch. NOVA BOY lacked speed and was five deep entering the
stretch. AWESOME BUZZ , two wide chasing the pace, weakened on the turn. PHANTOM RO stumbled at the break and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
KING BUBBLE (IRE) settled off the pace while saving ground, gathered momentum while saving ground past the five sixteenths, shifted out five wide in
upper stretch, made a grinding run under a drive, collared UHWARRIE SKY in deep stretch and got the bob. UHWARRIE SKY , taken to rate, edged up
between runners near the half mile marker, eased out four wide for the drive, closed in under pressure, took over in mid stretch, briefly went clear inside the
sixteenth pole, kept on gamely but lost the bob. CRAZY KATER secured the inside early on and rated close up, angled three wide into the lane, had aim in
mid stretch but was out finished. SPEED GAME prompted the pace outside BAHAMA CHANNEL, moved alongside after a half mile, dueled then gained a
slim lead heading towards the lane, kept up the fight past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BAHAMA CHANNEL took over early, set the pace towards
the rail, dueled from the half mile marker, kept on past the three sixteenths then weakened late. THE QUANTICO KID edged up outside rivals and stalked
the early pace, raced three deep past the half mile marker, was under asking pursuing past the five sixteenths and faded. JAMMER , rank from the gate,
lagged off the pace, came six wide for the drive and failed to menace. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was squeezed back early, moved up three wide near the half
mile pole, chased behind foes but came up empty. GIO DUDE , wide, was under pressure leaving the far turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DIGITAL DREAM stumbled at the break, steadied when forced in soon after, regrouped and reached a stalking position after a quarter mile, took aim of the
dueling leaders mid turn, angled four wide soon after, bid between rivals into the lane, dueled to the inside of FLAVA'S DREAM, was brushed when battling
past mid stretch, kept on tenaciously to take a slim lead inside the sixteenth marker then held firm to the line. FLAVA'S DREAM , in close soon after the
break, rated off the leaders, made a bold five wide run into the lane, lugged in when dueling on a short lead in mid stretch, exchanged a brush with the
winner and kept on gamely to the line. WINDRUSH KARMA was guided inward soon after the break and tightened rivals, set a pressured pace inside,
dropped back some heading to the quarter pole, altered back out in the final furlong and kept on willingly to earn the show. EXPECT THE SUNRISE vied
between foes, gained a short advantage around the turn, fought on past the three sixteenths then weakened. NOTION INTERRUPTUS broke slowly,
regrouped and edged up to be with the pace three deep, vied into the lane then faded in the final furlong. UNION BETTY flashed speed inside, failed to
keep pace leaving the far turn and weakened. An objection by the rider of FLAVA'S DREAM against the winner for alleged interference soon after the start
was not allowed.
