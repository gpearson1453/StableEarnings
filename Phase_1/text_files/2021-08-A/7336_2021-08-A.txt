Footnotes
RAMONCITA LIGHT was away in the midflight and was hustled to contest the early pace, was two wide on the turn while opening up the lead, extended the
lead off of the turn but was challenged in the final going by the runner-up and held on to prevail. WICKED SUNSET had no speed in the early going, saved
ground while two wide between horses on the turn, rallied leaving the furlong marker to put pressure on the winner but could not reel her in while besting the
rest. DESERT SMOKE contested the early pace with RAMONCITA LIGHT, was three wide on the turn while losing a bit of ground to that foe and was
outfinished in the stretch. TAKES A VILLAGE stalked off of the early pace, was five wide on the turn while gaining ground but was outkicked in the stretch
run. CHARGING HOME sat just off of the early pace, lost position while four wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch run. SOMARA bobbled at the
start, chased from the rear of the field early, mounted a bid on the turn while saving ground but tired in the stretch drive.

wide between horses on the second turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
HOT RAGEOUS broke sharply and was hustled to set quick fractions, was two wide on the turn while being challenged by DO YOU HEAR THAT, shook off
that foe off of the turn and was kept to task through the lane to win in a drive. EMPIRE HOUSE sat just off of the early pace, was four wide on the turn,
swung widest into the stretch and rallied late to get second but was not pressuring the winner in the end. DO YOU HEAR THAT tracked the winner into the
turn while four wide, gained a bit of ground on HOT RAGEOUS leaving the turn but weakened in the stretch run. LIAM'S SECRET chased the pace through
the turn while two wide and did not rally in the stretch. TESS'S WILD CAT was away a step slowly and chased the field from the rear, was three wide on the
turn and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LOAFERS BOY settled in the midflight through the second turn, mounted a quick bid while five wide on the second turn to pass the tiring pacesetter, led off
of the turn and drew away in the end. TIZONA dueled on the front end with GOVERNANCE through the second turn, was confronted by the winner nearing
the top of the stretch and was outkicked by that one while holding on at the end for second. COOLCROSS settled off of the early pace, was three wide
between horses on the second turn, bumped GOVERNANCE when DEALERS HAND drifted out leaving the five-sixteenths marker, and weakened in the
stretch run. AGENT ZERO was unhurried in the early going, was two wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch. DEALERS HAND settled
toward the rear of the field, saved ground on the second turn, came out a path leaving the five-sixteenths marker and bumped COOLCROSS and tired in the
stretch run. GOVERNANCE dueled for pace duties with TIZONA through the second turn, was losing a bit of ground when bumped by COOLCROSS
leaving the five-sixteenths marker, clipped heels, stumbled and took up after that incident and was eased coming into the stretch.

Footnotes
PAPER BOY sat comfortably off of the early pace, was two wide on the second turn, mounted a bid leaving the turn to collar RED HOT CAT inside of the
furlong marker and had a late kick in the end to prevail. COLLUSION DELUSION was unhurried in the early going, was four wide on the second turn, made
a bold rally off of the turn and pressured the winner in the late stages but could not reel him in while besting the rest. ROWDYROOSTER had no speed
early, was two wide on the second turn while improving position, continued that run through the stretch but was outkicked by the top two, while holding for
third. RUNAWAY KRISTIN stalked the pace, saved ground while in the two path on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn but was outfinished in the
stretch. RED HOT CAT tracked the leaders from the midflight, gained ground on the second turn while three wide, led leaving the turn and into the final
furlong but was passed by the winner and weakened in the stretch. CHARMING VINTAGE prompted the early pace, was two wide on the second turn while
improving position but gave way in the stretch. MATTAWA N THAT stalked the early pace while saving ground on the second turn, was outrun off of the turn
and was empty for the stretch drive. NACHO VICTORY settled toward the rear of the field, was two wide on the second turn and did not rally in the stretch.
SHUSTER broke alertly and set all of the pace through the second turn while saving ground, but faded in the stretch drive.
