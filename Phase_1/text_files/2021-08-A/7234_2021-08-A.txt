Footnotes
C R'S MANDATE stalked the earlier pace about the four path, moved to the lead past the half mile pole, came under presure at the five sixteenths and dug
in under steady encouragement to edge away from HUCKLEBERRY FRIEND the final sixteenth, while the latter rated a slim early lead inside, was caught
past the half mile pole and engaged in close chase from that point, dropped back at the rail leaving the quarter but remained a factor through the upper
stretch before flattening the final sixteenth. AZURE FIRE settled back off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the quarter pole and raced off the rail on the far
turn, came between horses in the upper stretch then angled in and dueled for third mid-stretch while gaining on the runner-up. MISTER DEEKS rated off the
pace and off the rail the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then flattened in the lane. NORMANDY'S EMPIRE settled off the pace
about the three path the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, then weakened in the four path of the far
turn. ROCKET BLUE stalked the early pace two deep while between horses, gave chase into the backstretch then faded past the five sixteenths pole.
PARIS CALLING hesitated at the break and showed no interest.

Footnotes
MADY ROSE stalked off the rail the first turn then moved to even terms past the seven sixteenths pole, dueled at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn, dropped back past the eighth pole but dug in through the lane to take over late stretch and raced clear under the wire. MACKENZIE'S MUSIC took the
lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and angled in to rate the pace, was met leaving the seven sixteenths, dueled with the edge nearest the rail on the far
turn, moved clear leaving the eighth pole but was caught in late stretch and flattened stride approaching the wire. C V'S POWERPAK was shuffled back at
the start then saved ground the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in
the five and six paths, dug in for third mid-stretch and finished well. ETERNAL HEART was reluctant to load and raced in the three path the first turn, settled
close into the backstretch, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened. JAMESTOWN ROAD rounded the opening
turn about the four path and settled close into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced close to the mid point of the far turn then
weakened. MOONLIT SHADOW rated just off the early pace inside, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail
then weakened. SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS came out at the break, rounded the opening turn about the three path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened in the four path of the far turn. KATALIMA bobbled leaving the gate and raced well off
the pace in the three and four paths, showed little response through the backstretch and rounded the far turn just off the rail.

HYPOTHESIS was shuffled back on the chute then gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path of the turn, dug in from the head of the lane
and got up later yards. AARON'S TAP was forced in leaving the chute and checked past the half mile pole, picked up the chase through the backstretch,
raced off the rail on the turn then dug in from the eighth pole to take second the final strides. GRUMPELSTILTSKIN set a pressured pace while tapering
inward, dug in leaving the turn but was caught later yards then nipped from second approaching the wire. UNRIDEABULL came in at the break and
engaged in close early chase, raced off the rail on the turn, lugged in through the upper stretch then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. BE BE BOP chased
inside, raced near the rail on the turn and finished well. FREEDOM IS RINGING was forced in at the break then steadied leaving the half mile pole, gave
early chase toward mid track, checked between horses approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn about the four path then weakened. SAGEBRUSH
stumbled to his nose leaving the gate and was never in contention.

Footnotes
WELLING rounded the opening turn in the five path then stalked three wide into the second turn, challenged leaving the half mile pole and dueled at even
terms from the three eighths, exchanged light contact with BROTHER CORBIN in the vicinity of the eighth pole and dug in determinedly from that point to
inch ahead late yards, while the latter, stalked then challenged into the backstretch, took the lead nearing the three eighths pole and was met soon
afterward, contested the far turn nearest the rail, exchanged light contact with Welling a furlong out then dug in gamely to deep stretch before reluctantly
ceding. CANDY INVASION rounded the opening turn in the four path and settled off the pace from the seven eighths pole, started a bid toward the three
eighths, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished evenly. LONG GRAY LINE settled back off the rail the first turn, raced in the four path the second turn
and left the turn outside, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and came through the far turn in the five path then passed rivals in an even finish.
MARYLANDER broke awkwardly and settled back saving early ground, bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three and four paths of the far turn,
angled outside into the lane and finished evenly to pass rivals. GHOST STALKER rounded the first turn in the four path then settled off the pace from the
seven eighths pole, gave chase nearing the three eighths, raced off the rail on the far turn then weakened. TITAN'S WILL raced off the pace toward the
inside, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. TRUE CROSSING rated a short lead inside, was met into
the backstretch and gave up the lead toward the three eighths pole, chased beyond that point but dropped back past the three eighths pole and faded at the
rail on the far turn. Following a Stewards inquiry and subsequent claim of foul against the rider of Welling, lodged by the rider of Brother Corbin, the
Stewards decided to take no action.

Footnotes
MARTIN MAN rated close off the rail then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead leaving the five sixteenths, drew clear midway on the
far turn and was steadily handled to draw off in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN rated close about the three path, challenged from the seven sixteenths pole and
continued in the three path of the far turn, then dueled for second mid-stretch. DESTINY'S CHARGE drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace,
was met nearing the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, gave up the lead past the five sixteenths, raced close to the mid point of the far turn
then flattened the final furlong. WILD CAPPUCINO rounded the first and second turns in the five path, raced outside into the backstretch and picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn about the four path and showed little more. GHOST ON A MISSION settled off the pace
and off the rail, started a bid into the backstretch then faded in the three path approaching the far turn. COMPROMISO raced in the five path the first turn,
the six path the second turn and ran outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, but showed little response and saved ground
on the far turn. GOTTAWAY saved early ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole then faded past the three eighths. DEPUTY DREW saved
ground well off the pace, showed little response through the backstretch and raced in the three path of the far turn.
