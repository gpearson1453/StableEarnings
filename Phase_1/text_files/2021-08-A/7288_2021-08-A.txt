SUNBRIGHT away well and stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, advanced three wide midway down the
backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, assumed command midway through the turn, and drew off late under confident handling. TOBESUNNY
away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, steadied off heels approaching the final turn,
shifted three wide to launch her bid through the turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove second best. BE COOL pressed the leader one out from
the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of KOALA in the run to the final turn, rallied two wide entering the turn, was quickly
overtaken midway through the turn, and was outfinished late. SUNGOLD BEAUTY unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid four
wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact while finishing five wide in the drive. KOALA broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the
rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but weakened in the late going.

rival midway through the turn, but had little response when tackled by U DID IT, but battled gamely through the lane to hold the place. MARYS TAPPIN
SHOES unhurried early while dropping back to trailed, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished with late interest three out from the rail in

MOUNT ASGARD tracked the leaders into the first turn while drifting a bit entering the turn, held a tracking trip from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and closed determinedly two out from the rail to get up in the closing strides. VALUABLE
COWBOY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace from along the inside in the run down the
backstretch, rallied along the inside while battling for the lead through the turn, and just failed to last. JUST JIMMY away well and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, engaged the leader two wide entering the final turn, and closed willingly two wide from between rivals late to
just miss. VISENYA settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished from along the rail in the drive. COUNTRY COWBOY away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong. VALUE DANCER was pinched at the start, and dropped well behind the rest of
the field in the run to the first turn, bided her time at the back of the pack, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to overcome her early
trouble.

MCMURPHY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the
run down the backstretch, maintained his advantage entering the final turn, and held the closers safely at bay late to prevail. FRANKIE MACHINE broke
sharply and tracked the pacesetter from along the rail entering the lane the first time, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along
the inside entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive to get up for the place. R W STANLEY away well and tracked the leader through the
stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to chase the leader in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, and battled one
out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. SLEW'S DA BOSS settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time,
commenced his bid one out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed three wide in the drive. HE'S RELENTLESS stalked the leaders one out from the
rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive. DAY RAIDER settled at the
back of the pack while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing
response when called upon.

assumed command soon after entering the final turn, and drew clear in the drive. HARLAN'S ANGEL broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep pace with the
winner through the turn, but battled gamely three wide in the drive to hold the place. SWORD FIGHTER settled well off the early pace while saving ground
at the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly three out from the rail in the drive to get up for a
share. PADDY D'ORO away well and stalked the leaders from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
finished one out from the rail in the drive. DAKATI settled off the early pace while racing two wide at the back of the pack entering the backstretch, rallied
along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed response when called upon. MARTELLO stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch
while racing one out from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.
