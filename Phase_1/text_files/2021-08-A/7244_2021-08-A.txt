Footnotes
FORT PECK went four then three wide on the opening bend, stalked the pace on the outside, cruised to the lead with seven-sixteenths to run, quickly drew
clear while dropping from the three path to the two path on the far turn, was shaken up into upper stretch, came under a left-handed crop at the furlong
marker, had the rider put the crop away outside the sixteenth-pole then was geared down significantly while much the best. JOURNEYMAN was hustled
from the start then taken under a tight hold along the rail on the first turn, raced just off the pace while rated, was urged two then three wide on the far turn
then was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted out while in hopeless pursuit of the winner outside the furlong marker and proved no match while just able
to get the place. AMERICAN TATTOO (ARG) was urged to take the early lead, showed the way on the inside with some company to his outside, lost the
advantage to the winner at the seven-sixteenths then dropped back under strong urging, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, moved out in upper
stretch and tired. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS angled in at the rear, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled near the back, moved closer around the
nine-sixteenths, was urged while inside to the two path early on the far turn, steadied outside the five-sixteenths then was roused while shifting three wide,
turned four wide into the stretch under a drive and came up empty. ZOOMER was urged into the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside in the two path,
dropped back under urging on the far turn and retreated. HEIRLOOM KITTEN hit the inside of the gate at the start but broke with the field, went two to three
wide on the first turn, dropped back early on the backstretch, moved closer with nine-sixteenths to run, dropped back in a bit tight in the three path outside
the three-eighths then moved to the five path and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. ALKHAATAM was hustled from the start then
caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer outside the half-mile pole, was urged four wide on the far turn, spun five wide into the
stretch and also faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
NEWBOMB broke out at the start bumping STAGE LEFT into DREAM BIGGER, vied between foes among a quartet and then a trio down the backstretch
from the two path, tucked inside as LIFE CHANGER got shaken off near the half mile pole, eased off the top pair at the seven-sixteenths allowing them to
knock heads into the turn and tipped out two then three wide nearing the three-eighths placed to coaxing, advanced outside the duelers through the latter
portion of the turn coming again and swung four wide into upper stretch, took over command near the three-sixteenths and went clear under a light drive to
the eighth pole and then was shown the crop to the right side ridden out to the finish. AMPERSAND broke a half a beat slow and inwards bumping the hind
end of DREAM BIGGER and conceded two lengths to the front before settling into stride then was devoid of speed briefly as the rest of the field vied for the
front, chased three then two wide before tucking inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing inside the five-sixteenths, tipped to the two path near the
quarter pole and was steadied off the heels of DREAM BIGGER before tipping out five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and improved position
for the place honors. LIFE CHANGER stumbled at the start and recovered under hustling to vie inside a trio briefly before being shaken off half a mile from
home, tipped three wide through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. DREAM BIGGER struck the
near side stall at the start, then got bumped between foes, came under hustling to vied from the four path among a trio before emerging in tandem with
STAGE LEFT to duel three then two wide through the turn to the outside of that rival taking advantage nearing the quarter pole before spinning three wide
for home headed once more by STAGE LEFT and backed away to the finish. STAGE LEFT bobbled at the break then got bumped by NEWBOMB breaking
outwards and in turn bumped DREAM BIGGER, vied three paths off the inside between rivals before separating himself in concert with DREAM BIGGER to
knock heads through the turn while along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths displaced from slight command, took the inside route into
upper stretch taking over a narrow and brief lead straightened away for home before being overhauled by the eventual winner, then tired to the finish.

Footnotes
RUSE broke very fast and went straight to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when asked on the far turn, spun
into the two path under a right-handed crop into the stretch, switched to a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths and drew clear under strong urging.
SANDRO THE GREAT was taken in hand early, went three wide on the opening bend, settled on the outside, was asked four wide on the far turn, chased
under a drive into the final furlong and secured the place while no match for the winner. UMBRIA broke in at the start, was taken in hand early then keen
under restraint into the first turn, saved ground while tugging at the bit on that bend, was well placed just off the pace, came under urging along the rail on
the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. BIG CASTLE broke a bit slow, angled in at the rear of the
field, settled towards the rear while saving ground, was urged along on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. ATHENRY
stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, was asked with three furlongs to run, spun three wide into the stretch under a drive, battled outside of the
winner past the three-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SHUTTERS was taken back early then tucked into the two path before the
first turn, settled at the rear, was roused while moving from the inside to the two path on the final turn, lugged inward in the stretch, moved out late and was
no factor. SPORTINI traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, was hard ridden
while three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HOT DOCTOR navigated the first turn in the three path,
tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide on the far turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and capitulated.

STELLAR TAP hustled from the gate, dueled three paths off the inside with BRIGADIER GENERAL to his inside, tucked to the two path as his main rival
took to the rail through the turn and continued to engage in head to head combat through the bend coming under light coaxing near the quarter pole, got set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, shook off BRIGADIER GENERAL straightened away near the three-sixteenths and drew off under a
drive with authority kept to task to the finish. KEEPCALMCARRYON bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside from near the rear until tucked inside half
a mile from home, came under coaxing midway on the turn, spun three wide for home and kicked on belatedly to secure the place honors clear of the rest
and second best while never threatening the winner. IMMOKALEE two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun three wide into upper stretch and rallied to offer up a bid to the furlong grounds, then flattened out in the late stages while along for the show honors.
PREDICTED bobbled at the break, chased five then four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under encouragement three furlongs from home, swung three
to four wide into upper stretch and weakened. BRIGADIER GENERAL bobbled at the start and came under hustling to duel from the two path with

the inside route into upper stretch, got shaken off near the three-sixteenths and weakened through to the finish. IMMINENT STORM chased three to four
wide at the tail of the field coming under motivation at the three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals through to the finish.

Footnotes
FLAVIUS bumped lightly with a rival at the start, was hustled to the lead, showed the way while well rated on the inside, responded well when set down in
upper stretch, swapped back to his inside lead when given one pop of a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a strong
hand ride to the wire while best. TELL YOUR DADDY stalked the pace on the outside in the two path, made a bid on the far turn, was given his cue at the
quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly while second best. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) lost his left-front shoe
during the warm-up and was ruled a purse-money only entrant, broke very fast, saved ground on the first turn, came off the rail onto the backstretch, was
rated in a good position, went three wide on the final turn, was roused at the quarter-pole then came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch and lacked
the needed kick while able to get the show. DREAMS OF TOMORROW broke in at the start, traveled around the first turn in the two path, was reserved
towards the back, raced in the two path on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. DELAWARE (GB) was reserved under a tight hold on the inside, remained under restraint on the far turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole
then turned into the stretch in the two path, came between foes inside the furlong marker and also lacked the needed response. SOUTH BEND was last to
commence, rounded the first turn in the two path, was unhurried at the rear, went three wide on the final turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then

turn and failed to respond. TEMPLE navigated the first turn in the two path, was reserved on the outside, went four wide on the far turn, was roused at the

WAR LIKE GODDESS got brushed between foes at the break, then got pinched back after the start, settled just off the inside at the tail of the field patiently
handled until angled out six wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied under a light drive to take command nearing the eighth pole, then forged
clear lightly ridden and was geared down in the final strides to the finish prevailing comfortably on the wire. MY SISTER NAT (FR) settled two to three wide
near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five wide into upper stretch advancing to be on near even terms when
overhauled by the top one nearing the eighth pole, dug in under a drive running on to chase that rival home and just preserve the place honors at the finish.
TEMPLE CITY TERROR brushed at the start, saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and got set down angled
four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to miss for the place honors while safe for the show. LUCK MONEY tracked the spurting away leader just
off the inside leading the main flight, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into upper stretch seizing brief command straightened away
near the three-sixteenths, got overhauled near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. DALIKA (GER) established the front widening away to a
commanding lead settling under a rating hold and into a comfortable rhythm through sensible splits while just off the inside, had the field begin to take closer
order seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away
and weakened. ORGLANDES (FR) broke in at the start causing pressure that placed rivals inside her in tight and to brush one another, tracked just off the
inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide for home and weakened in the stretch. CALL ME LOVE (GB) brushed at the start by
TEMPLE CITY TERROR, tracked the pace along the inside coming under a ride at the five-sixteenths, was under a stiff left rein to spin just off the inside for
home offering up a mild bid at that station, then tired once straightened away into upper stretch.

Footnotes
BELLA SOFIA stalked the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took the lead while asked into the stretch, kicked clear inside the
three-sixteenths, drifted in after getting a pop of the right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole then drifted out some into the final sixteenth and proved much the best under strong urging. SOUPER SENSATIONAL settled just off the
pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, dropped back leaving the backstretch, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path at the
five-sixteenths, was asked outside the quarter-pole, swung four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and was second best. SEARCH
RESULTS settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response while clear for the show. ALWAYS CARINA was rated off the pace, came under urging while two to three wide on the turn, cornered four
wide into the stretch then dropped in near the three-sixteenths and came up empty. OBLIGATORY lost her footing at the start, was reserved at the rear of
the field, went two then three wide while roused on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch, shifted further out inside the furlong marker and failed
to threaten. ILLUMINATION showed good speed, set the pace under some pressure from the outside, vied inside of the winner in the two path on the turn,
was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage into the stretch and tired. ZAAJEL was reserved off the pace, dropped back while let out inside on
the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path and failed to respond. MAKE MISCHIEF settled towards the rear of the field, went three then four wide on the
turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths and failed to respond.

drive, dug in and held safe to prevail. SOLDIER RISING (GB) broke in at the start brushing the near side stall, saved ground near the rear, came under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside for home, rallied up the rail offering a good finish to cut into the winner's margin and secure the place
honors clear of the rest. DU JOUR just off the pace tracking along the inside, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch and kept on to the finish to secure the show honors. BOLSHOI BALLET (IRE) forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader,
got coaxed along five furlongs from home, chased the leader through the turn and spun three wide at the top of the stretch, dug in under a drive prominent
to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. SECRET PROTECTOR struck the near side stall at the start, then got pinched out between foes, raced
three then two wide in pursuit from near the rear coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and passed tired
rivals in the drive. CELLIST broke in at the start brushing SECRET PROTECTOR, then pinched that foe back against YES THIS TIME, raced three wide into
the first turn before taking sole command tucked to the two path before taking to the inside down the backstretch, remained patiently handled showing the
way into the far turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded near the eighth
pole, then weakened in the late going. PALAZZI broke out at the start, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under encouragement at the

off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being let out angled out eight wide into upper stretch and offered no
response. CADILLAC (IRE) led early on before easing off to track from just off the pace just off the inside, came under motivation with five-sixteenths
remaining, angled out four wide into upper stretch and weakened. KING FURY three wide through the opening bend, settled just off the inside near the rear
of the field, tipped three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths to run, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no
kick. FLASHIEST two to three wide through the first turn, pulled keenly and grew rank under restraint off the heels of CADILLAC in the first turn, settled
three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing just past the three-eighths, angled five wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
KNICKS GO showed speed on the outside of SWISS SKYDIVER into the first turn then drew off in the two path, opened up a sizable advantage, saw the
margin diminish as he was given a breather late on the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path through the final turn, floated four wide into the
stretch then was guided further out while asked, responded well then extended the advantage again into the final furlong and proved much the best while
kept to the task under a solid hand ride. MAXFIELD went three then four wide on the first turn, settled well behind the solo leader on the outside, was asked
with a half-mile to run, went four wide under urging on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then dropped in at the three-sixteenths and safely
secured the place. SILVER STATE was hustled from the start, settled on the inside, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was roused while inside on the far
turn, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. SWISS SKYDIVER showed early speed on the
inside of the winner then was eased back off the pace while along the rail early on the first turn, shifted three wide shortly thereafter, settled well behind the
solo leader, moved closer with a half-mile to run, ranged up three wide under coaxing on the final bend, was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, chased
five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. BY MY STANDARDS stumbled at the start and lost his left front shoe, spotted the front a couple of lengths,
went three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the two path on the final turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
TIME LIMIT was rated under a tight hold while tracking the pace, rounded the turn in the two path while let out, was asked three wide into the stretch then
made a bid outside the pacesetter, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole then switched back to her inside lead and held off the runner-up under strong
urging. RISKY MISCHIEF broke out at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, swung four wide into the stretch,
came out into the final furlong and closed well but missed while able to get the place. SUSSEX GARDEN (IRE) was rated off the pace, brushed with a foe
near the nine-sixteenths, came under urging in the two path on the turn, chased three wide into upper stretch and finished willingly to just get the show.
SPICY MARG stumbled at the start then was hustled to the lead, showed the way through quick fractions, vied inside on the turn, was asked for her best in
upper stretch, lost the lead to the winner outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished then just lost the show. BAY STORM was reserved off the pace
under restraint, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, jostled with MINER'S QUEEN near the three-sixteenths, gained into
the final sixteenth, was taken in hand while in traffic late and missed the superfecta. BAY JEWEL was taken up with a snatch of the left-rein at the start and
spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch then moved further out and
improved position. MADAM MACLEAN brushed with a rival while well placed midway down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole then came off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MINER'S QUEEN broke out at the start, chased the pace
down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, floated five wide into the stretch, jostled with SUSSEX GARDEN near the three-sixteenths and
capitulated. BACK CHANNEL broke out then was quickly corrected by the rider, settled on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, was carried
seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond.
