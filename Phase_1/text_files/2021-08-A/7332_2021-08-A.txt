Footnotes
BUSKER ALLIE settled on the inside, moved out on the backstretch, advanced outside rivals into and around the far turn, angled four to five wide into the
stretch, rallied to the front while drifting in and brushed rival in the final sixteenth and drew clear nearing the wire. DISTORTED DIVA dueled for command
from inside to the stretch, battled down the stretch along the fence and finished gamely to the wire. AGADOR SPARTACUS got bumped leaving the gate,
dueled for the lead outside DISTORTED DIVA, battled through the stretch, got bumped late and missed the place. MOGOLLON RIM stalked the top pair off
the inside, roused past the three-eighths pole, entered the stretch three to four wide, rallied three deep with a sixteenth remaining then got bumped between
rivals and steadied late. VELVET GHOST was off a bit slow to begin, angled to the inside, taken off the rail on the backstretch, advanced through the far
turn and came three wide into the stretch, put in a mild late bid but needed to find more in deep stretch. BLUEBERRY EYES raced off the pace early, saved
ground into the lane and lacked room late. MEDINA MAN chased along the inside, went two wide into the stretch and weakened. EMPIRE'S FIRE bumped
outside rival at the start, chased between foes then in the two path and faded in the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
BUSKER ALLIE FROM FIRST TO FOURTH FOR DRIFTING IN LATE AND CAUSING MOGOLLON RIM TO STEADY, COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A
BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
SAMURAI CHARM broke out and bumped rival, sped clear and crossed over to the two path, controlled the pace through the early going, inched away past
the halfway point, opened up on the far turn, put left-handed urging in the lane, lugged in mid-stretch and was kept to task to win easily. TROUVILLE
stumbled at the start, raced three to four wide around the clubhouse turn, traveled four wide into the drive, brushed with VAROMA with a furlong to go and
kept on for a clear second. VAROMA bumped from inside at the start, was closest in pursuit to the outside of the leader, came three wide into the stretch,
brushed with TROUVILLE near the eighth pole and flattened to third. MAMA SUPERIOR checked off heels then again between rivals on the first turn,
angled out from the two path and came five wide into the stretch and had little left. FREEDOM LASS stumbled at the start but still came away quickest,
checked off the heels of the winner early on the first turn, stalked along the fence, dropped back on the second bend and tired.

Footnotes
WRONG TURN CUPID was off a bit slow to begin then rushed up to press the pace, lost contact briefly on the turn, came back and drew alongside in upper
stretch, took over approaching the eighth pole, cleared shortly after and held well over the runner-up. KITTEN'S KID bumped both sides leaving the gate,
chased the top pair into and around the bend, steered outside the winner late and finished willingly. APPLAUD THE BENCH hustled early from inside at the
start then checked behind the leader, traveled along the inside then two wide into the lane, came out in upper stretch and was along for the show. NAN
ELIZABETH sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, two wide into the stretch, lugged out near the furlong marker and kept on to round out the
superfecta. MAMBA QUEEN set the pace under pressure from WRONG TURN CUPID, cleared briefly around the turn, then was tested again by same rival,
relinquished command near the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong. ICONIC STORM got bumped and forced in leaving the gate, shifted out in
upper stretch and failed to menace. MISTAKA steadied slightly early, dropped back to chase outside a rival, angled to the rail around the turn and
weakened. STRIKING TIGRESS veered in and bumped rival leaving the gate, trailed early, traveled two then three wide on the turn, got forced out at the
top of the stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
LA PULCINELA unhurried through the early stages, steered out while asked around the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, rallied to the front
mid-stretch and drew clear. CLASS CODE tracked off the inside, exited the far turn four wide, rallied in the drive but got outkicked by the winner. CURIOUS
INJI up close early to the outside of the pacesetter, lost ground on the far turn, raced between foes in the lane and kept on to earn the show honors. QUEEN
OF LOVE set the pace on the inside, met bid past the three-eighths, dueled into the stretch, held command to the eighth pole then yielded in the late stages.
GRIGORO tracked off the inside then between foes, was driven three wide into the stretch but needed more late. MEDUSA'S GAZE raced in mid-pack early
on, split foes near the five-sixteenths, angled in leaving the far turn, looked to advanced but lacked room in the final furlong and was not persevered with
late. CAN FLY stalked outside a rival, bid alongside the leader past the three-eighths, dueled around the turn then drifted out some into the stretch, fought to
the eighth pole and flattened out. LADY BEYONCE raced five wide into the first turn then angled down to the two path, saved ground through the second
bend and never made an impact. ARISTEIA was rank early near the inside on the first turn, continued to chase near the rail to the second bend, dropped
back around that turn and tired. MY SIS CINDY raced four wide around the first turn, three to four wide on the second bend, tired and eased in the stretch
and walked off.

Footnotes
COOL YOUR JETS bumped with TALLEMARK entering the first turn, settled off the pace, swung six wide into the drive, closed fast alongside BIG COUPE
and surged clear. BIG COUPE traveled three deep around the first turn, moved closer up the backstretch, forced out past the seven-sixteenths, bid three
deep into the stretch, cleared with a furlong to go but could not fend off the winner in the final sixteenth. HAIL FREEDOM raced three deep early, stalked off
the rail then got forced out past the seven-sixteenths, bid between rivals in upper stretch but proved no match for the top pair. TALLEMARK bumped inner
rival and steadied in tight between foes on the first turn, angled five wide into the stretch, bumped with DONNER LAKE at the furlong pole and kept on for a
minor award. DONNER LAKE raced between foes early, tracked in the two path into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, bumped with TALLEMARK
at the eighth pole and could not rally. WARRENS CANDY MAN traveled in mid-pack on the inside, tipped out in the lane and lacked further response.
TIGER'S ARROW pressed from outside on the first turn then went up to take control, moved clear past the half-mile marker, came under a ride with a
quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch and gave way. CLUB MESQUITE off slow to begin, swung six to seven wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. LARRY'S LEGEND sped to the front from inside, lost command on the backstretch but stayed alongside to press the pace, shifted out
past the seven-sixteenths, coaxed around the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
BEER CAN MAN forwardly placed between rivals, chased two wide through the turn, bid outside in upper stretch, cleared foe mid-stretch and held safely.
HARBORED MEMORIES settled off the pace, raced along the inside then moved out in upper stretch, closed well but could get to the winner. LOVE MY
JIMMY away quickly to gain command, set the pace on a lone lead, inched away around the turn, clung to a short lead with a furlong remaining, ceded
command soon after and flattened to third. COMMANDER KHAI chased along the inside to the stretch, lacked room in upper stretch, tipped out to gain a
clear path but lacked the needed late kick. WILLY BOI angled to the inside on the backstretch, exited the turn two wide and never responded to urging.
POSO CREEK chased the lone leader three deep early, started to the weaken around the turn and had little left for the drive. GOOD WITH PEOPLE
dropped back early, pulled up on the turn and walked off.

Footnotes
PRINCE HUSSAR came away a step slow, went up between rivals to gain the lead, cleared at the three-eighths pole, put to left-handed urging in the drive
and held well. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT stalked in the two path, finished well through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. CHRIS FIX was off
slow to begin, came four wide into the lane, lacked room behind a pair of rivals and altered inside in upper stretch, kept to task through the drive and got up
for the show. CURLING SECRET away quickly in the beginning, up close early three deep, chased three wide around the turn, flattened out and got edged
for the show. STATE OF THE UNION chased two wide into the turn, continued a bit off the rail into the stretch and failed to menace. FALCON EX tracked
off the rail, took the turn three then four wide and weakened. MESA EMPIRE broke well from outside, chased four then five wide and in the lane.
EDDIESPAGHETTI hustled early from inside, showed early speed, chased the leader into the turn, steadied approaching the three-eighths, dropped back
and tired.
