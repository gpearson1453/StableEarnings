Footnotes
HOMEMADE MOONSHINE allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the stretch, then drew off the final furlong.
BETTYS BOMBER allowed to settle, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and closed well for the place. SURPRISE KICK set
the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held the show. DONALDSON vied for the early lead on the
outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. ONLY ONE WAY BACK well placed and outside, held
position two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into he lane and flattened out. SQUIRREL rated back early, tracked the pace, came through
inside of rivals into the stretch and faded the final furlong. ODIN'S HONOR mid pack, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the
lane and had no rally. PUDDLE JUMPER was a brief factor, inside. SEMI AUTOMATIC was never involved.

THE PROGRAMMER tracked the pace, angled out to stalk that one into the second turn, gained a short lead through the turn, then lasted under steady
pressure. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane
and lacked the needed late kick. SAMURAI SONG allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the second turn, bid four wide into the lane, then
could not gain the final furlong and held the show. OUR DOMINATOR well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and held a share. MCSTEAMY allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the second turn, bid
three wide into the lane and weakened. DOUBLE RAINBOW passed tiring rivals. GILGIMESH sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway to the
second turn, then had no rally. BABY BULL well placed and outside, steadily lost ground.
