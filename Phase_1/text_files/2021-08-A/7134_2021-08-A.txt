Footnotes
DON'T POKE THE CAT stalked three wide, bid four wide on the turn, dueled into the stretch, rallied to a short lead, then was all out between rivals to prevail
in a driving finish. GRIMGRINNIN' GHOST stumbled badly at the start, pulled in the early stages, settled off the pace inside, rallied between horses past
midstretch and surged in the final yards. PURIMETER set the pace racing a bit off the inside, showed the way into the far turn, dueled into the stretch, dug
in gamely inside through the final furlong and battled to the end. HARDCORE FOLKLORE raced off the pace between rivals, advanced on the turn, moved
up five wide at the quarter pole, bid entering the stretch and then weakened. PROFESSOR SNAPE stalked two wide, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled
between rivals in the stretch run and weakened late. KALEIDOSCOPE KID tracked inside, made a rail bid on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the
stretch, dueled and weakened. FLAT BILL raced three wide off the pace and was outrun.
