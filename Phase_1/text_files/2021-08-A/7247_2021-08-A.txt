Footnotes
FIELD LETTERS tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, swung wide coming
off the turn, took over in upper stretch and drew off to the wire. STOPSHOPPINGAMY stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to
trail the field headed into the turn, saved ground from there, began a bid approaching the three sixteenths pole and gained ground late on the outside.
TEXAS RAIN pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, chased the leader into the turn, moved up to challenge from the two
path nearing the three eighths pole, dueled in upper stretch and was outkicked between horses in the final furlong. JETS A GINNIN was away from the gate
quickly, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, and tired on the rail in the stretch. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SUBURBAN COURT was sent for speed and soon cleared, saved ground around the turn, opened up further when driven at the three sixteenths, continued
to draw off under a drive to the sixteenth, and cruised home the rest of the way. VITALE tracked three deep early, soon settled back second last, was
pushed for a bid from the seven sixteenths and improved in the two path, proved no match for SUBURBAN COURT when driven in upper stretch, but
chased on safe for the place. MICHAEL COLLINS tracked the leader outside of RICHIE'S PALACE early, lost position while chasing in the four path on the
turn, floated out into the lane in the seven path under a drive, and chased on outside while all out. LIFE IS GRAND settled at the rear, saved ground at the
rear around the turn, was driven for a bid in the two path into the stretch, and flattened out late. RICHIE'S PALACE broke inward, tracked the leader early,
began to fade in the three to four path near the three eighths, and had no more for the drive.

JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge between horses while racing around the turn, dueled
from the two path into the stretch, and pulled clear in the final furlong under a drive. RARE ACTION ATTACK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in
the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid from the rail nearing the five sixteenths pole and gained ground steadily on the inside down the
lane. HEY HEY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and gained
ground on the outside in late stretch. NICE AND TRUE broke sharply, led the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dueled in upper stretch
and gave way between horses in the final furlong. STRAIGHT UP SMARTY was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid. VEGAN GOES BEST chased the frontrunner on the outside in the opening stages,
began a mild bid from the three path nearing the three eighths pole, and tired on the outside in the stretch.

Footnotes
MONGOL BULL sent for speed, set the pace while pressed hard by POWER CRY early, took less intense prompting from that foe while setting the pace in
the two path on the turn, cleared into the stretch, and held under a drive. BOOM BOX was fractious in the gate, settled at the rear down the backstretch and
in the two path on the turn, began to inch closer past the five sixteenths, was driven in the two path in upper stretch, dropped to the rail approaching the
furlong mark but lost his hole because DIVE DEEP shifted in at the same time, instead altered out three wide, rallied with good interest, and missed. DIVE
DEEP was urged for early pace but outsprinted to the lead, tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, came into the lane
in the two path behind the leader into the lane, dropped to the rail approaching the furlong mark, offered a mild rally but was outfinished for the place. HIGH
HERO settled in second last, was pushed along in the four path on the turn while chasing the leading pair, was driven three wide in upper stretch, and
lacked the needed kick. POWER CRY was hustled to hound outside of MONGOL BULL early, attended outside him in the three path around the far turn,
proved no match for the pacesetter past the quarter pole and flattened out between horses in the lane.

Footnotes
LIPLINER bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the outside up the backstretch, raced between horses in
the two and three path around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch, eventually wore down her rival and pulled clear in the final furlong. I LOVE TO
RACE bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from
the three path nearing the three eighths pole, and gained ground on the outside to the wire, the best of the rest. TIZ A QUEEN pressed the pace on the
outside in the early going, dropped back to chase the leaders from the two and three path around the turn, and finished evenly between horses down the
lane. DEEP DISH dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and into the stretch, and
gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. FUDGE BROWNIE trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, drifted
out mildly in upper stretch and improved position late between horses. OZETTE raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, came
around the turn in the two path, gained some ground on the outside in late stretch and was outkicked at the wire. SING ME SWEET settled in the middle of
the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI POINT was sent for speed, prompted the pace outside of CRANKSHAFT down the backstretch and through the turn, bid on him approaching
the turn for home, led near the three sixteenths, drove clear in the final furlong and held safe. SPLASH FOR GOLD settled toward the rear, chased in the
two to three path on the turn, kept on patiently between horses in upper stretch, found his best stride inside the furlong pole and made a good belated gain.
TIMINGISEVERYTHING settled in the rear flight outside of OFFLEE FUN early, raced patiently in the five path on the turn, swung seven wide into the lane,
improved late and got up for the show outside OFFLEE FUN in the shadow of the wire. OFFLEE FUN settled at the rear inside of TIMINGISEVERYTHING,
continued in second last in the three to four path on the turn, swung out six wide into upper stretch, rallied in the final furlong but was nailed for the show.
CRANKSHAFT was sent for speed inside, set a pressured pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, was headed by SHANGHAI
POINT near the three eighths, kept on in close range inside that foe to the furlong mark, and emptied out inside. EASTER MUSIC chased midpack early,
advanced into the turn to track the leading pair in the four path, floated five wide into the lane but could not match strides with the top two horses, and
flattened out. GREELEYS ICE tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven behind the leading pair into the
lane, proved no match for the leading pair, and weakened two wide.

Footnotes
BATTLE SCARS trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path still at the back of the pack, began a bid nearing the quarter pole,
and gained ground quickly on the outside in late stretch, to just get up for the win at the wire. CLYDE'S GREEN GO pressed the pace between horses up
the backstretch, raced in tight quarters in the three path around the turn, gained ground steadily on the outside down the lane and was caught in the final
strides. INSIDE THE CIRCLE dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and raced
gamely in the final furlong, getting caught late. ALPINE GHOST tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, offered
a mild bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and finished evenly. PHAROAH CAT raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
navigated the turn from the two path, and improved position mildly while drifting out in the stretch. STORM'S REFLECTION raced in the middle of the pack
on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the turn, gained ground on the inside in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final
sixteenth of a mile. BETTER THINK TWICE raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked between
horses from there. TALKTOEACHOTHER stalked the leaders on the outside in the opening stages, raced in the two path around the turn, and weakened
between horses in the final furlong. COLD BIRDIE raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn
from the two path and came up empty in the stretch. ARTIE AND JESSIE chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while
racing in the three path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and continued to tire from there.
