Footnotes
DIVA'S FINALE sped to the front and vied with a pair of rivals into the first turn, inched ahead to take control, set the pace under pressure to the second
bend, dueled with SOMETIMES ALWAYS through the far turn and into the stretch, shook free nearing the eighth pole and inched away. SOMETIMES
ALWAYS vied three deep into the first turn, ceded the lead but still pressed from outside, dueled around the far turn but faltered in the final furlong. MR.
PICKLES settled off the pace, went two wide into the far turn, two wide into the lane and kept to task for a clear third. LANGUAGE BARRIER tracked
between foes on the backstretch, asked at the five-sixteenths, exited the far turn three wide and offered no response. ACHILLEUS off slow to begin spotting
the field several lengths, went around a rival on the far turn, came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. BOURBONWITHATWIST vied between
foes early into the first turn, pressed around that bend, taken back to stalk the top pair on the backstretch, started to weaken around the second bend and
was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
JASIKAN (IRE) hesitated and came away last, advanced outside rivals up the backstretch, bid four then three wide outside the top pair on the far turn, led
into the stretch, cleared past the eighth pole and held well in the final sixteenth. IRISH HEATWAVE pulled and fought the rider first time through the stretch
to the half-mile marker, driven three wide into the stretch, rallied in the lane, lacked the needed late kick and saved the place. FRENCH GETAWAY off slow
to begin, settled inside, angled out into the stretch, finished well and missed the place. LUCK OF THE DRAW pulled early first time through the stretch,
stalked on the inside, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked room off heels late. THE BLACK ALBUM (FR) brushed while vying for command between rivals
leaving the chute, dueled for command from outside to the far turn, vied between through the second bend and flattened in deep stretch. FULL OF LUCK
(CHI) vied for the lead from inside early then dueled with THE BLACK ALBUM, vied with a pair of rivals on the far turn and weakened in the late stages.
WESPHIRE reserved in the early going, exited the far turn three wide and never threatened. STORM THE BASTILLE (FR) brushed early while vying for the
lead early and was a bit rank leaving the chute, ceded the lead to the top pair and took a stalking position, went up three deep past the half-mile marker,
chased two wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SWEET SOULMATE dueled for the lead early from inside, inched ahead then cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, held command a bit off the rail around
the turn and was kept to task to the wire. DOZO stalked from inside into the turn, closest in pursuit through the turn, urged right then left-handed in the drive
and proved second best. WIN OFTEN sat off the pace outside a rival, took the turn two wide and whittled the gap late while earning the show honors.
BELLA RENELLA steered out into the clear early while trailing, navigated the turn four wide, kept on for a minor award but failed to threaten. VEGAN
stalked the pace outside a rival, went three wide around the turn and lacked a bid. SUMMER LOVE saved ground into the stretch and was not a factor.
TRIP TO FREEDOM dueled for the lead from outside early then pressed from outside, chased the leader into the turn, steadied while weakening at the
five-sixteenths and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
QUIET SECRETARY set the pace on the inside, met the bid from LOUNGE ACT on the far turn, kicked clear from that foe, led into the deep stretch and
gamely prevailed. SHE'S SO SPECIAL stalked the pace from inside, angled out into the stretch, rallied outside the winner but could not find more.
QUERELLE settled along the inside, saved ground to the stretch, finished well up the fence and held the show. GOLDEN CURL tracked between foes then
outside a rival off the pace, went three wide into the drive and missed the show. TRICKLE IN raced in range off the inside, exited the far turn three wide,
raced four wide in upper stretch and could not produce a bid. DISAPPEARING ACT raced near the back of the pack of the pack early, swung four wide into
the stretch and made no impact. SHE'S OUR CHARM leaned back and was off slow to begin, saved ground into the lane, tipped out in the drive, put in tight
quarters and checked mid-stretch and could not regain momentum. HOTITUDE went three wide around the first turn, two wide into the stretch and
weakened. LOUNGE ACT was closest in pursuit outside the leader, bid alongside at the five-sixteenths, faltered in upper stretch, shifted out mid-stretch and
weakened, then fell following the race but was able to get up and walk away under her own power.

Footnotes
ROCK THE BELLES dueled for the lead outside BABY STEPS early on and through the turn, shook free at the top of the lane and drew off under
right-handed urging and steady handlingly. SHE'S GOT A WAY got bumped leaving the gate, chased outside a rival, took the turn four wide, then rallied for
the place. TALKATIVE GAL broke out and bumped in the beginning, traveled two to three wide into the lane, lacked room behind rivals in upper stretch,
angled out with a furlong remaining and was along for the show. BABY STEPS dueled for the lead from inside into and around the turn, lost contact at the
top of the stretch, drifted out in the lane and weakened to a minor award. HALF PAST TWELVE bumped both sides at the start, stalked the dueling pair
outside a rival, went three wide around the bend and never threatened. MACHO QUEEN saved ground into the stretch, tipped out late and made no impact.
RUBY RAY stalked in the two path through the turn and weakened. WETHERLY coaxed early from the gate but raced off the pace, traveled two wide
around the turn and was never a factor. SACRED BEAUTY lacked early speed and never got inolved.

BURGOO ALLEY (IRE) stalked the lead outside a rival, took aim two wide into the lane, bid alongside in upper stretch, struck the front near the sixteenth
pole and drew clear. CARPE FORTUNA tracked the speed in the two path, angled three wide on the second bend, bid outside the top pair with a furlong

and drove clear. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE dueled for the lead inside of NEW SOI PHET early, battled around the turn and led into the stretch, could not
match strides with the winner in the final furlong but stayed on to hold second. GERLACH'S chased in the two path, angled out at the top of the stretch and
finished evenly for the show. IRONDALE dueled for the lead from outside, fought to the eight pole and flattened out. NEW SOI PHET raced off the pace
early on, entered the lane two wide and lacked a rally. FAST BUCK got bumped from inside at the start, chased four wide through the turn and weakened.
NAUGHTY NIKO broke out and bumped rival, dropped back early, navigated the turn two wide and never got inolved. ASSURANCE sat off the pace well off
the inside, went five wide into the lane and was never a factor.

I'LL STAND TALLER stalked off the rail, two to three wide around the turn, shifted in at the eighth pole, then overhauled the runner-up in the final sixteenth.
NICHIREN pressed the pace early then chased leaving the backstretch, bid outside at the five-sixteenths, put a nose in front at the quarter pole, cleared into
the stretch, led through the lane but could not contain the winner late. LETSGETLUCKY hopped at the start, traveled along the inside into the turn, steered
out and came four wide into the stretch, showed late effort and earned the show honors. CATEMACO sped to the front along the inside, cleared rival at the
half-mile pole, challenged around the turn, lost the lead with a quarter mile to go and flattened out in the lane. BIG STORY chased off the rail, four wide into
the turn, angled down to the two path and never responded to urging. INTENSE chased on the inside, dropped back around the turn and had little left for the
drive.

Footnotes
ANNA FANTASTIC hustled to the front, sped clear and set the pace in the two path into the turn, showed the way a bit off the rail into the lane, roused in
upper stretch and stayed strong to the wire. NU PI LAMBDA forwardly placed early near the inside, waited for room in upper stretch, gained an opening and
asked at the eighth pole, could not get to the winner but finished a game second. ROSES AND CANDY tracked off the rail, angled to the inside on the turn,
lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path and rallied for the show. FANTAIL (GB) chased between rivals early, checked early on the turn, entered
the lane three wide and kept on to earn a minor award. LALIC (FR) off a bit slow to begin, advanced outside rivals on the backstretch, got bothered early on
the turn, exited the turn four wide and finished evenly in the late stages. XMAS SURPRISE chased three deep early, between rivals on the turn and failed to
produce a bid. LOUD LOUD MUSIC raced two wide into the turn, eased out to the fourth path, angled out further in the drive and could not rally. ISN'T SHE
LOVELY chased four deep up the backstretch, three deep around the turn and weakened. MAGICAL THOUGHT angled to the inside early, trailed into the
stretch, angled out in the lane and made no impact. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL dropped back early, went two then three wide around the turn, steered out in the
lane and lacked further response.
