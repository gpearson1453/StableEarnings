Footnotes
SOMEONE SAID SO, off slowly, switched out four wide racing through the backstretch while being prompted to advance, continued with a steady bid
shifting inwards racing into upper stretch challenging for command and drove clear. PRINCESS LIVIA, pulling between foes racing through the backstretch,
switched outside rivals nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to prove best of the others. ICE POP, broke sharply, was urged to dictate
the pace between foes on a narrow advantage, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and gave way late. REMARKABLE
CHARM, bumped at the start, settled last and passed only tiring rivals. ORNAMENTAL IRON broke outwards bumping REMARKABLE CHARM, was righted
to prompt the pace three wide in early stages, continued to press the issue between foes into the turn and gave way into the stretch. PRETTY SWEET,
urged inside foes prompting the pace, gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER broke outwards bumping WAKE UP CALL, was quickly righted to gain a forward placing along the rail tracking just off the pacesetter
racing to the turn, tipped to the two path entering upper stretch while being prompted to advance, then took over in late stages under firm left handed
pressure. THATSAFACTJACK, urged to the lead while angling to the the inside in the opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to upper
stretch, briefly resisted the winner's bid but yielded late. SKIPPY'S STRIKE settled off the second flight racing through the backstretch, angled to the rail
entering the turn and continued with interest inside foes to late stages to gain position to the end while earning a share. WAKE UP CALL, bumped, then
pinched back at the start, was righted to track off the leaders along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch but had no
final kick. KELLER'S GOLD tracked the pace outside foes in second flight and steadily faded into upper stretch. RAY'S ANGEL broke sharply, was urged
three deep prompting the pace racing to the turn, was fanned four wide into upper stretch and gave way. LAST PROMISE broke inwards bumping WAKE
UP CALL, was taken up avoiding tight quarters at the start and trailed throughout.

FLORIDA TWO STEP was rated three wide between foes tracking the pacesetter as part of the second flight through the backstretch, shifted inwards on the
turn while being prompted to advance on the pacesetter, moved to wrest the advantage leaving the furlong marker and edged forward under left handed
pressure. WYOMING CONQUEST was roused from the outset to gain the lead, dictated the pace on a clear margin along the inside through the backstretch
into the turn, resisted the winner's bid past midstretch but proved only second best. SIZZLING EVENING was rated between foes dropping out last in the
opening quarter, was prompted to advance between foes nearing the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with a steady effort
to gain position while earning a share. BLAME BISHOP tracked just off the pacesetter four wide between foes in the opening stages and faded racing into
the turn. ZORICH, caught five wide in early stages tracking the pacesetter, continued in pursuit of the pacesetter three wide into the turn and gave way
nearing midstretch. TRULY BLING tracked just off the pacesetter inside foes in the opening quarter and steadily faded into the turn.

Footnotes
A ROSE FOR RAVEN broke readily, shifted inwards to gain the advantage between calls racing to the first turn, conceded the lead nearing the backstretch,
continued under patient handling tracking the pacesetter while losing some ground to that foe midway through the backstretch, was prompted to advance
with a sharp move entering the far turn, took over with a quarter mile to go, went clear into upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement. COASTAL
WATERS, reserved last while angling to the inside, saved ground on the far turn gathering momentum, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and
prevailed for the place honors. SOUL COAXING was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, split foes racing into the far turn, tipped
out three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest while being outkicked for second. RUNAWAY HARRY, urged to gain a forward placing
racing to the first turn, tracked the leaders between foes to the backstretch, lodged a brief bid nearing the lane but came up empty in the drive. OXWOOD
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and gave way entering the far turn. TENOR angled to the inside tracking the leaders in
second flight, was prompted to advance inside foes while caught in close quarters racing into upper stretch and had no closing bid. MO MORE, urged to the
lead outside the eventual winner racing to the first turn, was sent clear through the backstretch and gave out abruptly nearing the quarter mile marker.

Footnotes
ILLUMINATI broke sharply, dictated the pace on a narrow margin while angling to the inside, shook clear racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end
under firm handling. NO MO HOOCH, pulling inside rivals as part of the second flight racing into the turn, switched outside the winner entering upper stretch
to challenge, drifted out markedly through the lane but continued well enough to prevail for the place honors. MASTER GUNS, reserved along the inside
racing to the turn, shifted out splitting foes in upper stretch, then angled to the rail in late stages while moving to close the gap on the top pair.
OUTERBANKS was rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the turn, angled out five wide entering upper stretch and gained some position in an
even effort. WHATA SHOW OFF settled outside foes in early stages, was fanned six wide racing into the stretch and gained some position late while no real
threat. DEMIGOD, off slowly, saved ground through the turn and passed inside tiring rivals late. WENYEN tracked the leaders outside rivals in second flight
racing three deep to the turn and gave way nearing the lane. CRIME SPREE settled between foes and failed to menace. I'M A SPECIAL STAR tracked the
leaders between foes in second flight racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch. TEQUILA TIME angled inwards while being urged to force the pace
outside the eventual winner racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY A. TRAIN tracked off the second flight racing four wide through the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady, three wide advance racing into
the turn, moved to challenge the pacesetter in that path in upper stretch and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement. REESE C tracked the pacesetter
between foes in second flight racing to the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch to bid for command inside foes and was just outkicked. ADRIANNA JOY,
bumped from both sides, then squeezed back at the start, settled along the rail racing to the turn, shifted out racing into upper stretch and found a late
response between foes to gain a share nearing the wire. GIVE EM SHADE broke inwards bumping ADRIANNA JOY, was settled between foes racing three
wide into the lane, then drifted inwards under pressure late while gaining some position. ADDED DIAMONDS broke outwards bumping ADRIANNA JOY,
was righted to track off the second flight along the inside, shifted out three wide racing into the stretch and finished evenly late. HOT HABANERO broke
sharply, pulled her way clear racing off the inside racing through the turn to upper stretch but faltered late. DIGGS WON broke slowly and passed some
tiring rivals. HONORS HONOR was urged inside foes pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch and gave way racing into the turn. ALL SING BABY
stumbled at the start and dropped out early. RINGAROUNDTHEROSIE tracked the pacesetter briefly three wide between foes but dropped out early.

Footnotes
OFF SIXES, in touch with the first flight between foes attending the pace in the opening half, pressed the issue three wide through the far turn, then edged
forward outside foes in the closing stages to prevail under firm encouragement. TAPSOLUTE settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved
ground to upper stretch and displayed some late interest to close the gap inside the winner while edging rivals for the place honors. CANDY WOMPUS
tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the backstretch, bid for command along the rail when presented an opening after a half, dueled for
command inside foes on the far turn to upper stretch and weakened in the drive. JOE JACKSON, urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the backstretch,
shifted off the inside after a half, dueled for command between foes through the far turn to the lane and weakened late. VIX VISION, in touch three wide
prompting the pace in the opening half, was fanned four wide into the far turn, drifted out nearing the lane and gave way. CIMPL MAN, firmly rated off the
first flight between foes racing to the far turn, lacked a closing response. DANZ A REBEL settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and failed to
menace.
