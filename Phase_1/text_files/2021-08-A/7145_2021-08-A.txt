JUST PICK ONE was in pursuit three wide off the top two leaders, hustled along into the lane, took command near the furlong marker and finished clear.
BLOKE sped to the lead at the start then conceded position to POSTED, chased in close pursuit around the turn then sustained a steady bid through the
lane. POSTED angled inside and took over the early lead, held on top near the inside into the lane then failed to keep pace nearing the eighth pole. EL MIC
TIESUN chased the pace around the turn, went three wide into the lane and failed to move on. SCAR THE MAN was off awkwardly at the start, arced in the
back and saved ground to no avail. DISONESONTHEHOUSE chased in range around the turn, went four wide into the lane and had no late response.

CLOONTIA settled nicely and stalked the pace along the inside, edged up closer and steadied late on the far turn, given cue two wide at the eighth pole,
took the inside path, gained the lead then held on under a driving finish. EARNEDNEVERGIVEN settled off the pace through the backstretch, remained
patiently ridden inside around the far turn, shifted out four wide at the head of the lane, gathered momentum under steady pressure and was getting to the
winner late. YOUSHOULDBESOLUCKY raced two wide in range through early stages, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, continued in
contention with a furlong left to run then chased evenly in the final sixteenth. ARGENTIC (FR) stalked the leader through the backstretch, launched a bid
late on the far turn, drove to the lead in the upper stretch then got outfinished in the final sixteenth. GUNSLINGER (IRE) hustled up to the lead at the start,
set the pace through the backstretch and continued on top around the far turn, got collared upper stretch and gave way. BROTH raced in the back and
saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
LOCAL MOTIVE raced two wide up close around the turn, hustled up and took the lead in the final furlong then held safe. ROLL DEM BONES took over the
lead after opening stages, saved ground into the lane, got collared by the winner in the final furlong but stayed on with response. WOW WHATA SUMMER
chased in range around the turn, sustained a three wide bid into the lane, raced up close then lacked the closing kick to prevail. MERCURY TEN raced near
midpack, hustled along four to five wide in the lane and needed more for serious impact. KING SABAN saved ground around the turn, angled three wide in
the lane, gained closer contention then finished evenly. NIGHT BOSS briefly held the lead, chased inside around the turn then gave way in the lane.
CYNERGY'S STAR saved ground then angled out three wide and had no kick. DETERMINED KINGDOM was off slow at start, raced wide into the lane and
failed to threaten. MR JEFFERSON hustled up three to four wide around the turn and failed to advance.
