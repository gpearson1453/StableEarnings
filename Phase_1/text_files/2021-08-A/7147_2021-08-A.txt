the sixteenths pole and drew off while wrapping up late for the score. SMOOTH TALES gained four wide on the turn, reached the leaders three across, took
the lead and then was no match. FROSTY THE DRAGON ducked out at the start, vied for the lead off the rail, took the rail midway on the turn, eased out a
path and weakened. BUSTIN HOFFMAN unhurried along the rail and then closed late inside. MISSALPHA vied for the lead from between to the furlong and
gave way. STONE GUITAR three path on the turn and tired. SON OF DARKNESS vied for the lead three across to the lane and tired.
