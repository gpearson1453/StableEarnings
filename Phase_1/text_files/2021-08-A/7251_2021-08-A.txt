Footnotes
ZIP NOW got bumped and crowded early, cleared at the seven-sixteenths then crossed over to the two path, inched away around the turn, then padded the
lead in the final furlong. MOUNT OLYMPIC brushed from outside at the start, showed early speed then chased the lone leader past the seven-sixteenths,
was along the inside into the turn, two wide into the stretch and held on for second. SURPLUS away quickly to begin, could not keep pace with the early
leader, chased two wide to the stretch, finished well but missed the place. HOT SPOT broke in and brushed leaving the gate, got bumped from outside
early, went two to three wide on the turn and flattened out in the final furlong. GERLACH'S lacked early speed from inside, saved ground to the stretch and
passed tired rivals. MISAWA got pinballed between rivals then crowded soon after and checked early, traveled three to four wide around the bend and
weakened. SO CAL MEMORY drifted in and bumped rival at the start, dropped back off the pace, took the turn three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
DEFUNDED forwardly placed early outside the top pair, bid alongside the leader into the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths, kicked clear soon after
and drew off under right-handed urging and steady handling in the final furlong. INDIMAAJ settled off the pace early, went three to four wide earl on the first
time before angling inside rival, moved to the inside on the backstretch, angled four wide into the drive and bested the rest. IMPOSSIBLE TASK bumped
with outside rival leaving the gate, stalked from inside the moved out to the two path, came out on the far turn and five wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. BEYOND BRILLIANT bumped with inside rival at the start, sped to the front on the first turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, cleared
briefly past the half-mile pole, challenged by DEFUNDED into the second bend, lost command at the five-sixteenths, failed to fight back to the stretch and
weakened to fourth. PALACE COUP stumbled leaving the gate, steadied off heels nearing the first turn, chased off the rail into the stretch, came up empty
and was eased to the wire and walked off. BETITO away quickly from the outside, angled over to the three path, lost command then pressed from outside to
the half-mile pole, lost ground into the far turn, dropped back around that bend, eased into and down the lane and walked off. TRUTH SEEKER lagged
behind early, pulled up on the far turn and walked off.

Footnotes
FIRST PREZ sent for lead and vie with a pair of rivals up the backstretch, cleared around the turn, put to right-handed urging in the drive, led clear into deep
stretch and lasted. TOO LATE stalked outside a rival, three wide into the turn, four wide into the stretch, rallied in deep stretch but was too late. CASTLE
chased on the inside, checked past the five-sixteenths pole, remained inside to the drive, shifted out nearing the eighth pole and failed to find the needed
late kick. BENCH JUDGE tracked off the pace inside a rival, went two to three wide into the stretch, lacked room and checked off heels in upper stretch and
finished willingly once finding a clear path. ADMIRABLY settled outside a rival early, traveled three to four wide into the stretch and needed to find more in
the final sixteenth. ASCOT STORM stumbled shortly after the start, trailed into the stretch and passed tired rivals. TETON VALLEY vied three deep early,
chased the winner outside a rival on the turn, was crowded between foes at the eighth pole and weakened. AUSTIN'S BOY vied between rivals early,
chased the leader two wide through the turn, was put in tight quarters by inner rival shifting out at the eighth pole and weakened.

RESPECT THE CODE set the pace outside COMMISSIONER DAVID, shook free at the three-eighths, drew away on the turn and padded the lead in the
stretch. CHARTER OAK broke out and bumped rival, chased between foes then two wide into the stretch and proved second best. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH
stalked off the rail, chased three wide exiting the turn and held the show. REDLINE unhurried in the early stages, came out leaving the turn, shifted in upper
stretch and showed a mild response to urging. BRIGHT LEAF bumped from inside at the start, lacked early speed, trailed three wide into the stretch and
never made an impact. COMMISSIONER DAVID stumbled, broke out and bumped rival, pressed the pace from inside to the three-eighths, lost ground
around the turn and weakened. WALKING BOSS fractious in the gate, got bumped from inside at the start, chased three deep then four wide on the turn
and weakened. CURLY ESA bit crowded between foes early, chased two wide into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
IVA TOGURI sent for the lead from inside, inched ahead to take control, dueled with VA VA VOOM leaving the turn, put away that rival with a sixteenth to go
and found more to hold off the late rush from the runner-up inside. BIG SUMMER was bothered from inside at the start, raced off the pace early, angled
leaving the turn, rallied up the inside and missed. VA VA VOOM attended the pace three deep, dueled leaving the turn and into the stretch, fought to
mid-stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth. SPANISH CHANNEL broke out a bit, stalked the pace from inside, tipped out in the drive and finished evenly.
DELTA WIND hopped and brushed with inner rival at the start, raced off the rail then outside a rival, went between foes leaving the turn and could not rally.
SHOUT IT OUT threw head then bobbled at the start, swung out into the stretch and improved position. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR brushed with rival leaving
the gate, stalked outside the top trio, went four wide around the bend and weakened. YOUONLYLIVETWICE showed early speed between rivals early, lost
contact with the winner at the five-sixteenths and faded in the stretch. SOUL SWEET came away slow, sat off the pace outside a rival, steadied briefly inside
a rival at the five-sixteenths, angled to the rail on the turn and failed to menace. SHEZ OUR ARCH lacked speed along the inside, moved out to the two path
on the turn and came up empty.

ROCK N RYE broke out, chased outside the top pair, went four then three wide around the turn, drew alongside into the lane, took over then cleared
approaching the eighth pole, drifted over to the inside shortly after and drew away. TRIP TO SPAIN dueled outside MR. T'S THIRSTY for command, battled
through the turn, relinquished command to ROCK N RYE in upper stretch, lost his path briefly inside the eighth pole and stayed on well to prove second
best. MR. T'S THIRSTY bobbled shortly after the start, went up to duel from inside, fought to upper stretch and flattened in the final furlong. NORTHVALE
ROAD veered out leaving the gate, chased from outside early, went five then four wide around the turn and weakened. THERE WAS A RIDER'S CLAIM OF
FOUL LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TRIP TO SPAIN AGAINST ROCK N RYE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE JUST INSIDE THE EIGHTH POLE. AFTER A
REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THE INCIDENT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
SALLY STANFORD sped clear and crossed over to the inside, opened up on the turn, remained well clear into the furlong grounds, weakened late but was
able to hold on. SURELY SPECTACULAR was in range early on the inside, chased three wide into the stretch, kept to task through the lane and was
gaining to the wire. SMART MONIQUE was off slow and steadied behind rival at the start, traveled two wide around the turn and put in a mild late bid to
close the gap on the winner. SUE ETTAS GHOST shifted and bumped rival at the start, traveled in mid-pack early, exited the turn five wide and lacked a
rally. ALLWINEDUP bumped from outside and stumbled leaving the gate, went four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MISS
MALIA dropped back early, traveled along the inside into the turn, angled five wide into the stretch and failed to menace. DASHING DEMI lacked early
speed, went three wide into the turn, exited six wide and passed tired rivals. AMANDA ROSE chased four deep early, outside a rival into the turn, three
deep at the five-sixteenths and weakened. BONITA LEONA shifted out at the start, chased two wide through the turn and came up empty. ESSENTIAL
WORKER closest in pursuit to the turn, dropped back around the bend and tired.

Footnotes
SWORD ZORRO (IRE) settled at the back early while angling to the inside, advanced along the rail up the backstretch, waited for room leaving the far turn,
tipped out at the top of the lane, bid alongside the leader with a furlong remaining, took over shortly after, drifted out under left-handed urging, bumped
ZOFFARELLI late and prevailed. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) unhurried in the beginning, traveled in the two path to the lane, lacked room in upper stretch, angled
out mid-stretch, rallied between rivals then got pinballed late and missed. HUDSON RIDGE stalked the top pair, came three wide into the stretch, closed
from outside from outside, then got floated out and bumped twice late in a blanket finish. WYFIRE raced off the pace on the inside, lacked room leaving the
far turn and into the stretch, gained a clear path in upper stretch and finished willingly for a minor award. STILLETO BOY set the pace inside of CATHKIN
PEAK, cleared that rival entering the stretch, held a short lead at the eighth pole, was overtaken soon after and weakened. CATHKIN PEAK (IRE) pulled
early first time through the stretch, pressed the pace from outside, could not keep pace leaving the far turn, then weakened in the stretch run. FOLLOWING
A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, SWORD ZORRO WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST TO THIRD FOR DRIFTING OUT LATE AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE
TO ZOFFARELLI AND HUDSON RIDGE LATE IN THE RACE.

Footnotes
TEST DRIVE bumped leaving the gate, angled out in the stretch, rallied and overhauled the runner-up late. HEAD FOR BUSINESS broke in and bumped
rival at the start, angled off the rail and entered the stretch three wide, bid outside in upper stretch, cleared with a sixteenth remaining but got run down late.
IRRESISTIBLY SEXY was off a bit slow to begin, traveled in the two path entering the turn, angled five wide into the stretch, steered out widest in upper
stretch and closed fast to earn the show honors. LITTLE MISCHIEF broke out, chased briefly then went up to duel for command battled around the turn and
into the stretch, lost command in mid-stretch and yielded late. SAFE COMBINATION raced in range outside a pair of rivals early, came four wide into the
stretch and finished evenly. HOT PURSUIT stalked two then three wide around the turn, shifted out at the three-sixteenths, asked in the drive but could not
summon the needed response. ABI GEZUNT chased on the inside then two wide leaving the turn, moved off the rail in the lane and could not rally. BARZEL
FORCE away quickly at the start, went to the front then dueled inside, LITTLE MISCHIEF into and around the turn, fought to upper stretch and weakened.
UNION BLISS traveled off the inside, went three wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and lacked further response. LUCKY CHANCE was step slow
to begin, traveled along the rail then two wide into the drive and was not a factor.
