Footnotes
KATMAN QUICK rated close then bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled out into the stretch and dug in under
determined handling to just last. STATED stalked the early pace two deep then picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far
turn, drifted toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just missed. VICTORY GIVEN took quick control to rate the
pace inside, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, widened into the lane, and while steadily urged from the eighth pole, was caught in later
yards and just lasted for third. ROSAS WAY rounded the opening turn in the five path and settled just off the pace from the seven eighths pole, entered the
backstretch outside, started a bid from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn, drifted into the lane and just missed third. CARTER'S
RUN saved ground off the pace then eased out into the backstretch, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced widest on the far turn and could only close
the gap. GOTHAM BOY was not a factor. BIG BOOTS rounded the opening turn in the three path and settled close into the front stretch, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole, was taken up nearing the head of the lane and was vanned off in physical distress.

JACKS SISTER JILL took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace down the backstretch, widened toward the head of the lane
and was steadily handled in the lane. JUBA'S HOUSE pressured the early pace inside, but dropped back past the five sixteenths pole and had to settle for
second. DEREKA'S BLUFF exchanged contact with FIFTY GRAY SHADES leaving the gate and made lighter contact with Got Any on the chute, gave
chase through the backstretch, came through the turn in the three and four paths and finished evenly, while the latter, came away awkwardly and in to
exchange contact with Dereka's Bluff then picked up the chase, raced in the three path of the turn and showed little in the lane. GOT ANY was bumped and
bobbled on the chute, then lacked speed.

dug in through the final furlong and got up in late yards. JUST GETS BETTER drew clear and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure
leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn with the advantage nearest the rail, dug in under steady stretch encouragement, but reluctantly ceded
the final yards. PONTICELLO rounded the opening turn about the four path, bid nearing the three eighths pole and continued in the four path of the far turn,
then dug in through the lane to take third later yards. MIO BECOMING stalked the earlier pace off the rail, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced
off the rail on the far turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. LET'S GET PHYSICAL saved ground well off the pace on the first turn, started a bid toward
the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. TWENTYTWENTY saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path but showed little further. OFFICER UNBRIDLED settled off the pace in the three
path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
JIMMYSEXTRAGIRL took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure past the three eighths
pole, widened the advantage at the rail on the far turn then further extended her lead under steady stretch encouragement. DAMISELA stalked inside the
first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and was no match in the lane. WATERLOO ROSE was unprepared
and came away in the air, raced well back while saving ground on the first turn, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, ran four wide on the far turn and
was along for third later yards. HARDSCRATCH rounded the opening turn in the three path, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
on the far turn then flattened the final furlong. GLORY MARCH saved ground through the first turn and showed little response. ORTINOLA raced off the
pace inside the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and ran three wide on the far turn, but showed little more. FINDER ANGEL R V F
steadied off the heels of Hardscratch into the first turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then weakened.
STERLING FURIOSA saved ground racing well back.
