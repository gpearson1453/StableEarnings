AULD LANGE SYNE stalked the early pace, raced four wide past the seven eighths pole, moved up to challenge the leader around the far turn, raced four
wide to five wide in the drive and was clear late under strong handling. JEEZUM JIM showed good early speed to set all the pace from the outside and
couldn't match strides with the winner in the stretch to finish second best. LINDA'S NEKIA settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside down the
backstretch, continued to race near the inside in the lane and had not enough for the top pair. EMPTY NESTR stalked the early going, raced four wide into
the upper stretch and had no response. DAY was unhurried early on, raced five deep near the quarter pole and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TAPPIN HONOR came in a bit soon after the break putting Quad Eights in tight, was sent along to show good early speed and held gamely in the drive
while racing off the inside under strong encouragement. QUAD EIGHTS raced in tight at the break, moved up three wide around the far turn, angled to the
inside in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. Jockey of Quad Eights claimed objection against the winner for interference at the start and stewards
ruled no change. KUKULKAN broke to the outside, stalked the early pace, moved up around the far turn, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and
flattened out. TITHED was bumped soundly at the break, moved up five wide near the quarter pole, raced widest through the lane and had not enough in
the final stages. TIZ GOLDEN was squeezed back at the break, settled off the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late response.
MISTER MISTER broke to the outside, settled off the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn and never was a factor. PAPA LUKE was
bumped at the break, press the early leader and tired in the drive.

through the stretch and finished well to edge clear late under a steady hand ride. SPIN YOUR PARTNER showed good early speed to set the early pace,
was clear into the upper stretch but couldn't hold off the winner in the final stages. BIRD TYCOON was unhurried early on, moved up four wide near the
three sixteenths pole and showed good late interest. MARKETABILITY was allowed to settle in the early stages, moved up four wide into the upper stretch
and had not in the drive. MY LITTLE ROSY was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced three wide and tired the final eighth of a mile. PRIDE LEADER

LANFRANKOPHILE showed good early speed to set the early pace, raced well off the inside in the stretch and held gamely under strong pressure.
CASHING BIG CHECKS stalked the early pace, moved up along the inside through the lane and got up for the place position late. BLUEBERRY INDYGO
stalked the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. LITTLE MISS SASSY stalked the early going, raced five wide
nearing the three sixteenths pole and had not enough late. IT IS WHAT IT IS dropped back early, raced six wide into the upper lane and never was a
serious factor. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN was slow early, raced three wide around the far turn and had no response. AWESOME TAP raced a bit rank soon
after the start and was pulled up.

VICARAGE was unhurried in the early stages, moved up near the rail around the far turn through the stretch, surged late and just got up under strong
encouragement. DR. FERBER settled off the early going, moved up along the inside around far turn turn, raced just off the inside in the stretch run and
finished gamely to just miss. GALILEAN MOON pressed the early pace from the inside and weakened a bit in the latter stages. DAMIR showed good early
speed, raced well off the inside in the lane and weakened a bit late. GEORGIA PINES was off slowly, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had
not enough in the drive. OHANA EMPIRE stalked the early pace, raced six deep into the upper stretch and had no response. ALADDIN SANE dropped back
early on, raced four wide into the upper lane and never was a factor. BIG POLO stalked the pace from the outside, raced five wide in the lane and had no
response. HUSHED HIJINKS raced four wide at the seven eighths pole, moved up three wide at the quarter and never was a factor. MAKOTO settled off
the early pace, and failed to respond. FORTYEIGHTSTRAIGHT stalked the early pace, checked sharply nearing the three eighths pole and tired. STRIKING
IT LUCKY was forced to take up sharply off heels nearing three eighths marker and never threatened.

from the inside to show good speed and weakened the in the stretch. MI CASIMIRA stalked the early pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had
no response. HOLIDAY CONNECTION dropped back early and failed to respond. STORMY BELLA showed good speed from the outside and gave way.
