Footnotes
LATTE DOLCE broke well out of the gate, dictated the pace throughout, cleared off at the top of the lane and was much the best. YANKEE AGATE broke
sharply at the start then settled back off the pace on the inside, steadied slightly past the half mile marker, shifted out past the three eighths then
commenced a three wide bid and finished willingly to be second best under mild right-handed urging. PRIDDIS pressed between foes early, steadied off the
pacesetter at the half mile pole backing up into YANKEE AGATE, asked for run past the quarter pole and finished evenly through the lane. GOLDEN EYED
QUEEN was reluctant while loading, lunged at the break, off slowly then proceeded to rush quickly up into contention while four wide into the bend and
weakened in the lane. BLACK COFFEE BUZZ was off slow from the gate then continued far back throughout and was never a threat. HALF SCOUT
showed brief speed on the inside then retreated in the lane.

Footnotes
HOTASAPISTOL broke sharply then dropped back slightly off the early pacesetters, angled three wide at the quarter pole and drove clear under steady
right-handed urging. FULL OF GRACE broke well then attended the early pace set by LADY GOLDSTART into the bend, took command nearing the three
eighths pole then led the field into the stretch, failed to match strides with HOTASAPISTOL in the final furlong but was clearly second best. LADY
GOLDSTART hustled between foes to dictate the early pace, failed to keep up with FULL OF GRACE when challenged on the turn but finished willingly
through the lane to hold on for third. GIRLS A BULLET chased between foes in the early going, angled inside at the five sixteenths, altereed course at the
furlong marker to avoid rival and gained mildly through the lane. DICEY was slow into stride then prompted by the rider with right-handed encouragement
shortly after the break, commenced a brief three wide bid on the turn but failed to sustain that momentum in the lane. EVEN PANDURA chased the early
pace on the inside then shifted three wide nearing the quarter pole but had no late bid in the lane.

ROYAL PRIVACY was off well from the gate then attended the early pace duel between COLLEGE PARTY and ROCK VICTOR, commenced a bid for the
lead at the top of the lane and was fully extended to edge clear in the final sixteenth. SHARP ART was allowed to settle three wide in the early going, shifted
out four wide then commenced a bid nearing the quarter pole, and finished willingly in the lane to edge COLLEGE PARTY for place in the final sixteenth.
COLLEGE PARTY dueled between foes into the turn, took the rail after ROCK VICTOR backed out then dug in through the stretch but gave way grudgingly
in the final sixteenth but held on for show money. SORRISO tracked the early pace three wide, commenced a bid nearing the quarter pole then flattened out
in the lane. RUSTY CAGE off a step slow, checked off heels shortly after the break nearing the 9/16 but failed to menace in the lane. ROCK VICTOR dueled
on the rail to the five sixteenths then gave way and faded to the rear.

LORING PARK tracked between foes through the opening half, angled out at the top of the lane, and edged clear in the final sixteenth while under steady
right-handed pressure. DARK SOLUTION attended the pace three wide throughout, took the lead at the three sixteenths pole but was outfinished in the final
sixteenth. FEEDING FRENZY dictated the pace throughout, prompted with steady right-handed pressure past the quarter pole but weakened in the lane
and held on for show. MR. D'S LEGEND tracked the pace on the rail in the first flight, shifted out at the furlong marker but had no late kick. SR. BOM BON

Footnotes
WACO KID tracked the pace outside rivals in second flight, split foes racing into the far turn, shifted four wide advancing on the leaders and continued with a
sustained effort in a long drive to prevail under right handed encouragement. OWN THE TOWN tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch to challenge for command between foes and contested the issue in a protracted skirmish to the end
to just lose the nod. JIMMIE T, urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the far turn, edged forward nearing upper stretch, resisted the top pair through the
last furlong but just failed to contain those rivals. MISCHIEVOUS MO angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, improved position inside foes
into the lane but had no final kick. SHOW BUSINESS, urged inside rivals disputing the pace to the backstretch, dueled for command to the far turn and gave
way. BOX CANDY, forwardly placed three wide tracking just off the leaders, gave way racing into the far turn. DIRECT IMPACT, off slowly, never gained
contention. HOLY MUCHACHO settled outside foes and never gained contention. COURTING MOONLIGHT tracked the leaders between foes in second
flight to the backstretch and faded early.

through upper stretch and held her rivals on a narrow margin to the end under firm handling. MESA SKYLINE, urged to a forward placing racing four wide
into the first turn, continued just off the first flight to the far turn, was urged to challenge three deep nearing upper stretch, lost some ground to the leader
midstretch but continued willingly to close the gap late while prevailing for second. P CLUB was rated tracking just off the first flight along the inside racing to
the far turn, switched out racing into upper stretch while being urged to advance between foes and narrowly prevailed for a share while caught in close
quarters approaching the wire. TEDDY TIME settled last to the backstretch, was prompted to advance five wide on the far turn to upper stretch and
continued with a steady late bid while just losing the nod for a share. MY BOY LOLLIPOP, reserved off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch,
saved ground on the far turn gaining position inside foes, then split rivals just off the inside late to gain terms with the leaders nearing the wire. CANDY

CAMPS BAY bobbled slightly at the start, settled last in hand to the backstretch, split rivals midway through the backstretch gaining momentum, angled to
the rail on the far turn steadily drawing into striking distance, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch to challenge and went clear late under firm left
handed encouragement. COPPER FIDDLE was rated stalking just outside the leaders racing to the second bend, steadily moved to terms with those foes
three deep challenge for command between rivals racing into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. MY COWBOY angled inwards while
being urged to prompt the pace outside a rival racing to the backstretch, dueled for command between foes on the far turn to the lane and gave way leaving
midstretch. HAWKWOOD tracked off the first flight outside foes from out of striking distance racing to the far turn and lacked a closing response. PAPA
RIZZO, urged to the lead while angling to the inside racing to the first turn, dueled for command inside foes into the far turn and gave way into the lane.
BLUEGALE, off slowly, was prompted in pursuit of the leaders along the inside to the backstretch but dropped out early. ***PRIOR TO THE RACE THERE
WAS A 45-MINUTE DELAY DUE TO LIGHTNING***

Footnotes
JIMMY'S MARCO was urged inside rivals prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, conceded position to the pacesetter avoiding close quarters
entering the far turn, switched outside that foe while being urged to regain terms nearing upper stretch, continued a bit erratically through the closing stages
but edged forward to narrowly prevail in time under energetic handling. CAN IMAGINE joined the pace three wide in the opening stages, shifted inwards
racing through the first turn to press the issue outside a rival momentarily crossing the path of GO FOR A RIDE, dictated the pace to the second bend while
being urged to a clear advantage leaving the three furlong marker, angled to the rail racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid in a grudging effort
but couldn't contain that foe late. YAK tracked off the first flight racing four wide to the backstretch, was prompted to advance outside foes nearing the far
turn but steadily faded into the stretch while edging rivals for a share. ROBINSON broke slowly, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, was prompted
to gain position while angling to the rail nearing upper stretch and continued with an effort to improve position. GO FOR A RIDE, urged between foes
prompting the pace, shifted out three wide nearing the backstretch avoiding tight quarters, continued to track off the first flight to the far turn and faded
between foes into the lane. SIDE STREET DAVE, off slowly, settled between foes racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. POINT OF IMPACT,
reserved inside foes in early stages, failed to menace.
