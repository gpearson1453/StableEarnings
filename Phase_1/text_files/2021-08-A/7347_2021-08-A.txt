Footnotes
WHERES BRAYDEN got away alertly, set the early tempo with outside pressure from ACTION JUNKY, was headed by that one about the five-sixteenths
racing just off the rail on the turn, was further back in upper stretch but dug in and was resurgent to get the nod while exchanging light contact at the wire.
ACTION JUNKY pressed the pace of the aforementioned from outside, put a head in front at the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the turn, led till
late and was outfinished. FOXY RED stalked the dueling leaders, advanced three to four wide on the turn to reach contention at the head of the lane but
lacked the needed late kick. READS PET ZENON gained some ground into the turn racing in the two to four path, went evenly in the stretch. SHELLY
D'ORO shifted in, saved ground on the turn to no avail. CHA CHING CHARLIE veered in sharply at the start, raced in the two to three path on the turn and
failed to menace. RED CHILE was reluctant to load, broke a step slowly, raced off the inside and was not a factor.

Footnotes
FIRE WHEN READY was bumped and steadied entering the first turn then shifted in moving from the five path to about the three tracking off the loose
leader, continued near inside into the far turn then moved out two then three wide on that bend, took over outside the five-sixteenths, kicked clear and was
kept busy to maintain a safe margin. BEAN AND THE BUG was floated five to six wide in the early going, moved four wide to make a mild bid midway on
the far turn, proved no match for the winner. BRICKBAT saved ground on or or just off the rail through both turns racing well off the pace, angled five wide in
upper stretch and ran on to get up for show honors. IZA DADDY settled off the leaders near the inside in the two path, improved position.
SHARPSHOOTINGEORGE was unhurried early racing off the inside in the three path, shifted nine wide in upper stretch and gained late. BASHFUL BOB
exchanged a brush at the start, was about mid-pack three to four wide in the early going, moved out five deep on the far turn before shifting eight wide into
upper stretch, ran on evenly. PURELY POLITICAL exchanged a brush at the start and was in a bit tight, was off the leaders three to four wide and never a
threat. LIL LATIGO altered out four deep early- to midway on the first turn, continued four to six wide on the far turn, failed to rally. SEXY DEXY sped clear
and shifted in from the five path to the two to three path early on the first turn, was clear up the backstretch, overtaken on the far turn still racing off the rail,
faltered and faded. OUT ON SATURDAY was urged strongly at the break, drifted out about five wide into the first turn, continued to chase up the
backstretch, dropped back three to four wide on the far turn and faded. PER RULING #2021-DAA-33 FROM THE NEW MEXICO RACING COMMISSION,
BRICKBAT WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
