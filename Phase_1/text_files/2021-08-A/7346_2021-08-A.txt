Footnotes
WARNING BELLE broke outward, pressed the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, collared the leader in the final furlong and
wore down the pacesetter in the late stages. J M R BOLD VISION broke slowly, pressed the pace, moved up inside the leader on the turn, shook clear at
the top of the stretch but was caught in the final furlong and failed to stave off the winner. DAD'S MISSY stalked the pace, was hustled angling from two to
four-wide through the turn, rallied from outside DAD'S MISSY, was outkicked and did not lodge a bid then evened out in deep stretch. ONEZY'S DREAM
raced in mid pack, chased from the rail and two-wide through the turn then finished under a determined drive. MISGUIDED PASSION hopped out of the
gate and settled off the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn then finished gamely to no avail. TO SING MY SONG got away slowly but showed
a turn of speed, set a pressured pace, was engaged at the 1/4 pole, yielded at the top of the stretch and flattened out.

ANOTHER BREEZE settled in mid pack, rode the rail on the turn, rallied on the fence, had command in the final furlong and held sway under steady
handling. SEA SCOUT raced in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, was all out in the stretch but was outkicked by the winner. HALF LIT
settled off the pace, closed three and four-wide on the turn then rallied with good energy from the outside. SOUPER SIZE IT raced in mid pack, chased
three and four-wide on the turn then finished gamely in vain. PREACHLITTLEGOSPEL sprinted to a clear and comfortable lead, set the pace, was collared
in the final furlong and retreated. LAST SENSATION settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn then evened out in the late stages. THE BAND
COMING raced from off the pace, saved ground on the turn but was never in contention.

Footnotes
CANOLA WORLD broke inward and bumped OCELOT, raced forwardly, gained a short lead n the turn, was engaged upper stretch and battled under a
steady drive. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE stalked the pace from the rail, encountered traffic in upper stretch, cut to the rail and was up with a rush. COLTONS
DREAM had speed, dropped out of the duel at the turn, chased two and three-wide, rallied, bid in deep stretch but missed. MAAKWA forced the pace, failed
with a bid into the turn, rebid upper stretch, dueled to the end and missed, but if it wasn't for noses he might have been part of a quadruple dead-heat.
OCELOT, bumped with rivals from each side at the start, settled off the pace, closed fast from the rail to three-wide on the turn then rallied outside.
IMPRESSIVE SPEED was bumped at the start, settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn and chased gamely through the stretch. ADELAIDE
COURT settled in mid pack, dropped back three-wide on the turn but had no closing response.

Footnotes
SPEEDY MOONLITE forced the pace, took command at the top of the stretch, drove clear and held sway under a brisk hand ride. TOMCAT BLACK was off
slowly, stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn then finished gamely. MR. COOL led early, set a reserved pace, was headed at the
top of the stretch and chased to the wire. TALL WATER, away slowly and off the pace, was steadied behind rivals at the turn then hustled three then
two-wide to the stretch and chased to the end. JOJOMAR raced in mid pack, was hustled three and four-wide on the turn but finished evenly. VALUABLE
PILLOW raced in mid pack, chased four and five-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and leveled out. CHASING VINNY stalked the pace, chased from
the rail on the turn but his rally stalled in the final furlong. DUNES OF NAMIBIA, away slowly, settled off the pace, trailed on the turn but failed to menace.

CARMENOOTZ, in range, was hustled three-wide on the far turn and finished all out. PROLIFERATE broke outward, pressed the pace briefly then stalked,
chased into the stretch and was coming fast and late between rivals. COLEYVILLE was pinched back at the start, settled off the pace, chased two and
three-wide on the far turn and finished determinedly. VEGAS KITTEN broke inward but showed speed, set a pressured pace, widened on the far turn but

SOLAR allowed a rival to lead, came off the inside to stalk and press that foe to mid turn, took the front until falling behind in upper stretch, regained his
advantage at the sixteenth pole and persevered in the final going. COURT BATTLE led quickly, was stalked and pressed by the winner and lost the front
midway on the turn, came back to get the advantage in upper stretch but was passed again by that same foe, the eventual winner, at the sixteenth pole,
game but second best from the race long battle. CERRADO trailed throughout, darted up inside the foursome chasing the top pair turning for home and was
never a threat to the top pair but a clear third. FULL EXTREME advanced after the top pair into the turn but so were three rivals to his inside which resulted
in a six path trip throughout the bend, and still widest down the lane to best the balance. GUITAR GEORGE carried out in the four path when between rivals
chasing the top pair on the turn, stalling in upper stretch. AMBERWOOD angled out to be three wide on the flank of the two leaders into the turn with three
foes to his outside, hanging in to the stretch but fading down the lane. ARTISTICO was floated five wide between rivals on the turn, retreating down the
lane.

Footnotes
PARTY OF NO was off slowly and settled in mid pack, closed four and five-wide on the far turn, bid upper stretch, battled, and prevailed under a drive.
GRAND GIZMO, also off slowly and racing in mid pack, raced four then three-wide on the first turn, closed three and four-wide on the far turn, challenged
upper stretch, was lugging in but went after the leader in the late stages but on this day he could not match the winner while much the best of the rest.
SAINT'S REST, bumped at the outset, raced off the pace, chased hard three-wide on the far turn and was all out through the stretch. HIGHLAND JAX broke
outward, pulled to the fore leaving the first turn, was engaged in a duel at the half, matched strides to the top of the stretch and gave way. RIGHT TO
STRIKE was herded outward and bumped SAINT'S REST at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch
but leveled out mid stretch. WENJACK dueled on the first turn, was headed by HIGHLAND JAX but rebid mid backstretch, vied, led briefly at the top of the
stretch but was challenged and gave way. SOUPER BEST BET broke outward, stalked the pace, was hustled on the far turn then evened out in deep
stretch. LETTING LOOSE, off slowly, raced in mid pack, was hustled on the far turn then lacked a closing response. JR BOURBON was sent to the early
lead but he wasn't alone and dueled with WENJACK, began to drop back mid backstretch after HIGHLAND JAX had settled into the pacesetting chores,
trailed on the turn and was eased near the top of the stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.
