Footnotes
STOP HAMMERTIME was reserved early towards the inside, was roused leaving the three eighths to get motivated, then advanced on the turn and started
to ease out leaving the five sixteenths pole, swung out six wide for the drive and was given a right handed reminder when straightened, closed well and hit
the front shortly after leaving the furlong marker, then was given one left handed reminder by the sixteenths pole while drawing clear to prove best.
FOREVER A CHAMP was allowed to settle early towards the inside, then advanced on the turn and eased out approaching the quarter pole for racing room
and swung out five wide fro the drive while making a bid, could not go with the winner in the final furlong while finishing willingly to get the place award at the
wire. CIELO AZUL stalked the early duel and made a three wide move on the turn to shake clear leaving the turn, but faded in the final furlong losing the
place award at the wire. G AS IN GEORGE dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened in the final furlong. WHEREWEGOIN dueled for the early lead
three to two wide and weakened the final quarter of a mile. A LITTLE IRRADIC broke outwardly at the start, then raced four to three wide throughout and
failed to menace.

IJUSTWANTAHAVEFUN was rated along the inside, raced two wide on the backstretch then moved to the inside entering the far turn, then was boxed by
the quarter pole, then lacked racing room when straightened and moved out bumping TAPERINEA then closed full of run to get up in time under a drive.
ELUSIVE JUSTICE prompted the pace two wide and made a three wide bid leaving the turn and shook clear in the furlong grounds but was caught late to
be denied the victory. NIGHTTIME JUSTICE set the pace from the inside and was headed by the three sixteenths pole and faded in the final furlong.
TAPERINEA was four wide into the first turn, then went up to stalk the pace four wide on the backstretch, then came three wide into the drive while in
contention, then was bumped and had to check by the furlong marker losing all chance, then was bumped hard ten yards from the finish by CARMELLA
KEY for no apparent reason. CARMELLA KEY was five wide into the first turn, then raced five wide throughout and made a bid on the turn but flattened out
late, then came in bumping a rival late. TOO CROWDED was settled back early while saving ground, then raced on the inside into the stretch and found
traffic in the stretch but had no rally. OCELIA was bumped at the start, then stalked the pace three wide and weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION THE #6 VERSUS THE #1 FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AFTER THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE

TOUGH TO TAME hopped at the start,chased the early pace three wide, raced between rivals past the quarter pole, tipped out four wide leaving the turn
and responded well when roused and drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. CLASSIC MAX stalked the early pace three wide, drifted in
nearing the three eighths pole, was corrected immediately while being a tad green, then made a three wide bid leaving the quarter pole to take command by
the three sixteenths pole, but could not go with the winner late while clearly second best. MOWINS was well placed early on the inside, then steadied
nearing the three eighths pole, then continued on the inside while in tight entering the turn, then tipped out two wide leaving the turn but came up empty in
the drive. MAJESTIC ATTACK pressed the ;pace four wide and weakened. ORO AZTECA broke outwardly at the start, then showed speed and crossed
over to the inside to set the early pace, was headed on the turn and gave way in the drive. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF MOWINS,
CLASSIC MAX WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED THIRD. THE CONDITIONS OF THE RACE SHOULD READ "120 LBS" INSTEAD OF "119 LBS."

backstretch, moved to the inside on the far turn, then rallied well on the inside to gain the place award. JUST HUMMING chased the winner three wide,
made a mild bid on the far turn but flattened out losing the place award late, bested rest. FIGHTING ZELDA was reserved early on the inside, came four
wide into the drive and had a belated rally. STRONG ILLUSION was allowed to settle on the inside and had no rally. HOT N SWEET was reserved early
while three wide, then came five wide into the drive and offered no rally. TO FAT TO FISH was off slowly, then was void of early speed, came six wide into

Footnotes
LONG WEEKEND was well placed early while two to three wide, made a three wide bid between rivals to duel for command by the quarter pole, then was
roused leaving the turn and responded well to draw clear by the furlong marker, then remained clear to prove best, driving. ASH FLAT stalked the early
pace and made a four wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole but flattened out while being clearly second best. HURRICANE
HIGHWAY was outrun early, then was three wide by the quarter pole and angled out to the outside in the stretch and rallied well to gain the show award
late. ROB THE RICH was allowed to settle while four wide, then made a five wide move on the turn and then finished evenly missing the show award late.
POWELL chased the early pace and came three wide into the drive but lacked the needed rally. FLOWERPECKER set the pace on the inside and then
dueled for command by the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. BENNY was allowed to settle on the inside and weakened.
