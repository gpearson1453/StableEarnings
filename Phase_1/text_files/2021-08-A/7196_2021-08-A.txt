Footnotes
SANDRA'S JUEL broke alertly, set the pace along the inside under moderate early encouragement, came under a left handed crop entering the stretch,
drew out steadily under continued left handed encouragement to the wire. SPECTACULARSUNRISE last to the trio to leave, prompted the issue three wide
up the backstretch and through the turn, remained widest in the drive, proved no match for the winner through the lane. SUMITUP pressed the issue from
between horses for three furlongs, also lost contact with the winner when straightened for home while drifting, continued to weaken in the run to the finish.

STREAMER lacked speed along the inside, continued to save ground when moving a bit closer late in the turn, shifted outside the leader for the drive,
finished willingly to be steadily getting to that one late. TOTALLY GRACE broke alertly, set a soft pace in the two path under restraint, continued to show the
way into the lane, shook clear upper stretch, lugged in under a right handed crop, was straightened, enough left to last. MIDNIGHT TRIP pressed the winner
for over a half from the outside, had little left for the drive. FASHION MERIT finished early, trailed home while widest in the drive.

Footnotes
GOT GLEE broke alertly, allowed the leader to go early, chased that one in the two path into and through the turn, collared that same rival just inside the
furlong marker, drew clear under steady handling. SWEET PRAYERS settled off the pace and the inside, three wide turning into the stretch, along for the
place late, not a serious threat to the winner. NINEONEONEPRAYER a bit restless in the gate, bumped start, sprinted well clear soon after, continued to
hold a sizable advantage into the lane along the inside, faltered the final furlong when headed by the winner, lost the place late. SUCKERFORAGREY
bumped with NINEONEONEPRAYER at the break, raced back off the pace, saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit for the drive, went evenly to the
wire. SILVER SQUALL off the pace and the inside, dropped to the rail for the drive and came up empty. POOPSIE DOOPSIE last to leave, failed to menace
while racing outside.

Footnotes
SOBEK lacked early foot in some traffic through the first turn, lodged a bold move to challenge three wide turning for home, took over, lugged in, brushed
with HE'S A LUCKY MAN to bother that foe, dueled to the wire late, gained the nod. HE'S A LUCKY MAN broke on top, allowed the speed to go early, raced
closest to the leader just off the inside, challenged between foes turning for home, dueled past the furlong marker, gained a narrow advantage soon after,
bumped, bothered by SOBEK as that one lugged in late, continued to race on equal terms to the wire, narrowly missed. MAJESTIC SOCIETY forwardly
placed into the first turn, fell back the middle half, continued to lag in the far turn, improved position through traffic to gain the show late, not a threat to the
top two. GOTTATAKEHIMTO lacked early foot, made a mild advance the third quarter off the inside, came four wide for the drive, flattened out to be caught
for the show. HICCUP was never dangerous while racing off the inside. FIRSTTIMEVALENTINE off a step slow, was used on the outside to clear before a
quarter, showed the way up the backstretch, faltered when headed by the top two entering the stretch. O'CONNOR refused at the start, pulled up first turn,
walked back. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE BREAK, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT O'CONNOR WAS AFFORDED A FAIR
START. FOLLOWING A SECOND INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF HE'S A
LUCKY MAN AGAINST SOBEK FOR INTERFERENCE WITH A SIXTEENTH REMAINING, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND
PLACED SECOND. THE OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
FLASHING ANGELBABY away in good order, cleared from the outside into the first turn, rated in the run up the backstretch, opened a larger advantage
when straightened for home then held the runner up safe late to win ridden out in a cleverly handled ride. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN void of speed for five
furlongs, emerged from traffic late in the final turn to attain a forward position, continued a steady gain through the lane to be closing the gap on the geared
down winner at the wire. HERO OF THE HOUR chased the winner in vain while off the inside, had little for that one or the runner up in the drive, comfortably
saved the show. MUSCADINE void of speed off the inside, improved four wide through the final turn and into the lane, flattened out a bit the final furlong.
CALCULATE broke back, improved with a middle move after a quarter, also failed to sustain that advance through the lane. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI toward
the front into the first turn, took up sharply in traffic soon after, fell back, made little impact while improving a bit. CAJUN CASH chased the winner early,
remained in a forward position for a half then began a steady retreat while along the inside. CHAOSMOS floated five wide into the first turn, continued
outside, was finished after five furlongs while once again five wide through much of the final bend. HALF A BITE bothered slightly while between foes into
the first turn, faded after a half.

RED MAMBA broke well, cleared to the inside before a furlong, rated into the turn, drew out through the lane while being kept to task in a sharp effort.
FUNNY ACTOR also away in good order, chased the winner throughout, proved no match, clear for the place. IDE LIKE HAWAII went one paced
throughout off the inside, all out to narrowly hold the show while widest through the stretch. BUBBA SMACK restless in the gate, fell back to trail after the
start, improved position with some mild late interest. LUCKY BIG DADDY settled in mid pack early, came up empty for the drive. LIGHTNING HARBOUR
remained back in failing to menace. MULETRAIN was finished early, well beaten. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

FATHER GOOSE last to leave, cleared to the inside midway on the first turn, dueled up the backstretch and through the final turn closest to the inside, put
the other speed away past the furlong marker and edged away under steady handling. DRILLING REPORT with the early pace, allowed the winner to clear
in the first turn, rejoined that one onto the backstretch, dueled in the two path, could not keep up in the final furlong, held sway for the place. DREWHUSTLE
settled off the early pace inside, continued to save ground, slowly gaining for the place second. WISE ANCHOR in the second flight while racing off the
inside, lacked a closing kick when called on for the drive. OPENING QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
EXOTIC TOWN with the pace from the start between foes, continued to vie between horses through the turn, dueled past the furlong marker, edging away
late under steady handling. PERFECT PEACH moved up to race with the leaders closest to the inside, dueled inside the winner through upper stretch, gave
ground grudgingly to that rival late while lasting for the place. MISS LAUGHALOT broke out, was straightened to race in the second flight while racing
outside, four out to five wide turning for home, finished willingly to be gaining for place while too late. CAMP HALO lacked early foot, angled out to be four
wide turning for home, displayed some mild late interest to improve position slightly. ROARING QUINN set or forced the pace while three wide for four
furlongs, first to blink. HAIRTRIGGER HEART back off the pace while saving ground, continued inside through the turn, made little impact in the drive.
BEAR TOOTH PASS in mid pack early while racing outside, came six wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. LITTLE WILD ROSE broke in and slowly,
trailed early as a result, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. TRAPPE THE CAT broke back, moved up to head up the
second flight, four wide and in some traffic exiting the turn, gave way. G G'S WRECKINGBALL was never involved.
