LAMPLIGHTER JACK rushed to contention to set the pace fought off challenges from BOLD QUEST and ROARING RIVER and cleared at the quarter pole
and kept to task in the stretch. ROARING RIVER stalked the pace from the three path then made a bid on the far turn to vie for the lead and went four wide
into the stretch to be second best. MY CANDY BIZ chased the leaders from the two path then made a bid on the final turn and angled in going into the
stretch but flattened out. BOLD QUEST was two wide into the first turn and led briefly then vied for the lead from the inside on the backstretch and gave way
at the three eights pole. TIZ VALENTINO DAZE was unhurried early from the inside but was never a factor.

ALL FOR LOVE raced in the middle of the pack from the three path and closed willingly. CRABS N BEER vied for the lead from the two path then angled
out in the stretch but was no match for the top two. DONTFORGETTOBLINK stumbled at the start then was allowed to settle then made a four wide late
rally to improve position. STACKS OF SILVER raced in the middle of the pace from the two path then swerved out in the stretch drive but wasn't enough.

the turn but faltered in the stretch drive. MINECRAFTER was off a step slow but was never a factor. BOURBON MUSIC raced in the middle of the pack on
the inside but steadily retreated. TRUE DAKOTAN raced near the back and failed to menace. GOLDEN AVIEATOR pressed the pace early from the two
path then set the pace for a quarter and faded in the stretch drive.
