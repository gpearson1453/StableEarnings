Footnotes
WING COMMANDER stalked the clear leader from the two path, cut the gap outside of that foe around the far turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole,
assumed command entering the lane, drew off in upper stretch, and widened under driving pressure. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE settled far off of the pace
two wide, inched closer around the far turn before shifting four wide entering the lane, improved while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, completed
a bid for place while changing leads approaching the sixteenth pole, and reached that position on the wire. MY FAVORITE UNCLE stalked along the inside,
tipped outside of the leading pair entering the lane, only managed to chase the leader through the lane before claiming place at the sixteenth pole, but was
outfinished by an outer rival on the wire. CLEAT tugged to a clear advantage crossing the wire for the first time, managed that lonely lead into the far turn,
but met WING COMMANDER's bid turning for home, offered little resistance to that foe entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. TOLKIEN tracked
three wide, but faded in upper stretch. MR. SLATE settled off of the pace in the two path, took the far turn three wide while under urging, and lacked a rally.
AWSPRESSO broke inwards and was last away, then got outrun.

Footnotes
GENTLE SOUL prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane, then kicked clear passing the furlong pole and
widened with good energy. INJUNCTION set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing foes into the far turn, but was headed by
one of those rivals entering the lane, proved no match passing the furlong grounds, and stayed well clear of show thereafter. BAMALAMA steadied in tight
quarters among rivals while off of the pace around the first turn, pulled inside of foes entering the backstretch to a stalking position, tracked the leading pair
before shifting outside of them entering the lane, but failed to produce a bid, chased the leading pair home, and was best of the rest. SEMINOLE BEACH
pressed the pace three wide, but steadily faded around the far turn. GHOSTLORE perched himself four wide and outside of foes while off of the pace
around the first turn, but failed to keep pace with the leading group entering the lane, and failed to factor. SOUTHERN RAGS never got involved.
AERONAUT got keen while jockeying for position around the first turn, took back from midpack passing the three quarter pole, trailed the field around the far
turn before swinging six wide turning for home, but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
VERYLITTLECENTS set the pace along the inside, left ample racing room for GOLDEN SIGHTS to produce a rail bid entering the lane, repelled that foe
and cleared in upper stretch, then held sway while continuing to drift outwards through the final furlong. GOLDEN SIGHTS stalked along the inside,
attempted a bid for the lead inside of the pace setter turning for home, but failed to keep pace with that foe passing the three sixteenths pole, switched
outside of that rival at the furlong grounds floating MANASOTA SUNSET wider, but failed to gain on the clear leader's advantage through the final furlong
while shifting outwards to comply with that foe's drifting. MANASOTA SUNSET pressed the pace two wide, drifted out turning for home to come into the lane
in the four path, but was outkicked by an inner foe in midstretch while being herded multiple paths outwards, proved no match for the top two in the process,
and held show. CHOPIN DRIVE stalked three wide, but was floated to the five path entering the lane, failed to keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch,
shifted inwards in midstretch to counter leading drifting foes, then failed to bid for show late. SOUTHERN SKY lagged well behind the field into the turn,
shifted three wide entering the lane, and passed a tired foe on her left lead while not threatening. MOHAYLADY tracked two wide and between horses
around the turn, but faded through the lane. FOLLOWING A RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL OF GOLDEN SIGHTS vs VERYLITTLECENTS AND A TRAINER'S
CLAIM OF FOUL OF CHOPIN DRIVE vs MANASOTA SUNSET, BOTH FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, THE STEWARDS MADE NO
CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
ROGER MCQUEEN dueled for the lead two wide, then from between horses at the quarter pole as LUCKY BOSS bid for the lead, dug in to resist that foe in
upper stretch, and gamely edged away from that rival while safely holding from COSTA TERRA late. LUCKY BOSS pressed the leading duelers three wide
and under urging around the turn, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was turned away passing the furlong grounds, then just saved place from an inner
bidding rival on the wire. COSTA TERRA tracked along the inside, shifted to the three path while just behind the leaders in upper stretch, chased while
aiming to split foes through the final furlong, did so approaching the wire, but missed reaching place. TEXAS RED HOT trailed early on, gained mildly while
shifting two to four wide around the turn, but flattened out in upper stretch before producing a bid. DESERT RULER rushed along the rail to duel for the lead
inside of ROGER MCQUEEN, but gave way passing the quarter pole. CANDY LANDING settled off of the pace three wide into the turn, and faded turning
for home. MR. HALFTIME reared in the gate and tossed his rider, required to be backed out of the gate before being remounted, then showed brief speed,
but was outsprinted after a furlong, and steadily faded.

Footnotes
CARRIBEAN CAPER was bumped by an inner foe at the start, recovered to lie close to the pace, was taken in hand at the eleven sixteenths pole to shift
outside of the leader, pressed in earnest around the turn, bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of his game counterpart before forging an advantage
approaching the final sixteenth, and edged away late. MAGIC QUEST broke outwards and bumped CARRIBEAN CAPER at the start, set the pace while
feeling stern pressure from that foe into the turn, dug in as that foe produced a bid entering the lane, gamely clung to an advantage inside the final furlong,
but was headed approaching the sixteenth pole, and grudgingly gave in late. MINUTE WALTZ stalked along the inside and in the two path around the turn,
then chased the leading pair home through the lane. MALLOY settled at the rear of the field two wide, gained ground four wide turning for home, then
leveled off and moved up for a minor share. ROOKERY saved ground at the rear of the field, but to no avail. ALTERED SHOT stalked three wide while in
the four path around the turn, but faded in upper stretch. FOREVER BOSS tracked the pace two wide while in the three path and between horses around
the turn, but never got involved.

PARKLAND set the pace while well in hand, felt pressure from a pair of foes into the far turn, shook clear from a bidding PINE KNOLL entering the lane, and
held sway to the wire. PINE KNOLL lunged inwards at the start, stalked three wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, but was turned away in upper
stretch, then kept on well to stay well clear of show. BLAME THE BOOZE was bumped between horses at the start, stalked along the inside, but chased the
leading trio while under urging around the far turn, and failed to threaten the top two while managing show. RUNWAY MAGIC settled off of the pace along
the inside, took the far turn two wide, and stayed on to threaten for show. NOMADIC FIGHTER lied off of the pace three wide around the turns, but failed to
produce a bid. KING'S MISCHIEF had his hind quarters knocked from underneath him while bumping an inner foe at the start, recovered to track the pace
two wide and between horses, but faltered at the half mile pole, and was done early. HELLORHIGHWATER bumped an outer foe at the start, trailed the
field around both turns before bolting to the eight path entering the lane, and failed to make an impact. VIOLENT PASS pressed the pace setter two wide,
then from between horses around the far turn, but weakened at the quarter pole. SIR ROBERTO was pinched back between horses at the start, took the
turns two to four wide while far off of the pace, and never got involved.

SUPER STOCK pressed the leader from off his flank, vied around the far turn, forged an advantage entering the lane, drew clear approaching the furlong
grounds, and widened while being kept to task under driving pressure. THERE GOES HARVARD tracked along the inside, shifted outside of the leading pair
entering the lane, then chased SUPER STOCK well through the final furlong while proving second best. SERMONONTHEMOUNT took back early on and
lagged well behind the field around the first turn, cut the gap while saving ground around the far turn, shifted four wide turning for home, and rallied for show.
COLONEL BOWMAN set the pace while feeling pressure from the eventual winner to his outside, vied inside of that foe around the far turn, but was headed
entering the lane, and gave way in upper stretch. HANKS stalked three wide, but came under urging while pressing into the far turn, then faded passing the
five sixteenths pole. STARRININMYDREAMS settled off of the pace two wide, then three to four wide around the far turn, and failed to get involved.
