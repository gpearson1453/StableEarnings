SUPERHELPFUL broke a bit slowly, advanced strongly outside on the final turn and drew away through the final furlong. LET'S CELEBRATE dueled
outside, was collared nearing the quarter pole and continued willingly. LIAM'S LADY hustled to the front inside then weakened through the stretch.
TREASURE SEEKER reserved inside, lacked a rally but continued well. CAPE ELIZABETH drifted wide into the first turn, saved ground and was no factor.
A. C. RIGGS chased in midpack and weakened steadily. MYSTICAL CHARGE lunged at the start and raced well back throughout. BLAZING DIVA dropped
back early and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SILVER DAGGER pursued the loose pacesetter, took over on the final turn and edged away driving. TRILOGY settled close up, rallied into the stretch but
could not get by the winner. EL BORRACHO reserved inside to the stretch, angled out and closed well. NATIONAL HONOR broke slowly, raced far back,
bid very wide on the final turn. CHRISATUDE chased wide throughout, bid into the stretch then flattened out. MY TRAIN was taken under firm rating hold,
moved inside in the stretch but was no threat. OVERBOLD set the pace to the quarter pole and gave way. LAWYER ROY chased inside, moved briefly
closer before half a mile then faded. ABDAA dropped back early and was never in contention. DUBROVSKY trailed early and raced far back throughout.
GILDED WARRIOR prompted the pace briefly and gave way readily. FROST'S SONG was urged close up four wide for half a mile and stopped.

LI'LBITO'CHARM saved ground off the pace, angled out on the turn and wore down the leader in the final furlong. LE PETITE PAPILLON rated off the
pacesetters, bid to the front at the quarter pole, pulled clear but tired. BUCKS SOME rushed up inside in the opening quarter then flattened out in the
stretch. CHARITY STRIPE dropped back outside, advanced wide and closed well. TOMARIE crowded at the start, raced far behind and closed the gap.
HEROIC OFFICER chased three wide and lacked a solid rally. AUSSIE MIST quickly sprinted away down the backstretch but stopped after half a mile.
LUSCIOUS LOLA chased in the two path and weakened steadily. COME AND GET IT raced near the inside and was always outrun. MIDNIGHT MIRACLE
raced far behind throughout.

GRANDFIRE controlled the pace then remained clear to the final yards under strong handling. RATED SPECIAL bobbled early and trailed, angled wide in
the stretch and offered a late surge. HARD COUNT stalked the leaders three wide and continued willingly. INVENTIONIST settled inside, bid into the stretch
but was outfinished. STONEGATE settled in the two path and finished gamely between rivals. COUCH DREAMS dropped far behind, moved inside in the
stretch closing the gap. THE METHOD lacked speed then passed fading rivals. DOUBLEPOUR drifted out into the first turn and was always outrun. GO
HUSKIES chased in midpack and weakened. NOBLE CALLISTO was urged close up inside to the stretch and faltered. ZEALIN IT prompted the winner
outside then stopped after half a mile.
