FAR AWAY LOOK broke out at the start bumping KISSES FOR VAL solidly into BEING ME without correction and squeezed out KISSES FOR VAL, chased
just off the inside coming under urging at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, got steadied and altered inwards off the heels of the drifting
FLIPPING FUN just inside the three-sixteenths, rallied to issue a challenge taking command a sixteenth from home, then inched away to the finish to
prevail. FLIPPING FUN coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and floated to
the three path straightened away, drifted out two paths near the three-sixteenths despite a right handed crop and correction forcing the aforementioned foe
to steady and alter inwards, dug in taking command just outside the eighth pole and came under threat drifting out two to three paths once more inside that
station, got collared a sixteenth from home and kept on clear for the place honors. BIG LITTLE RISK hustled from the gate intent on being forwardly placed,
chased four wide briefly isolated between the leader and the main body of the field before advancing tucked three wide through the turn to press the issue
with ARMS AN ARMOR coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late
stages while clear for the show honors. KISSES FOR VAL got bumped solidly at the start and was squeezed back due to pressure from the breaking
outwards FAR AWAY LOOK, chased three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, spun
just off the inside for home and improved position for the last major share. ARMS AN ARMOR hustled from the gate, established the front and showed the
way coaxed along just off the inside, came under pressure near the midway point on the turn from BIG LITTLE RISK and floated that rival briefly four wide
when drifting three wide herself three furlongs from home as she was placed to urging, swung four wide into upper stretch under threat, yielded the front
near the eighth pole and weakened to the wire. BIELEFELD coaxed from the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two
to three wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MY PRIMO hustled
from the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the get go, angled five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BEING ME stumbled at the
start and was bumped solidly by KISSES FOR VAL due to pressure from FAR AWAY LOOK, who broke outwards, chased three wide under a ride from the
three-eighths, went four wide for home and tired.

PRICE TALK steadied when put in tight by outside foes early, rounded the first turn in the two path under a tight hold, was rated on the outside, went three
wide on the far turn, was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch then took a short lead at the three-sixteenths, dueled outside
of the runner-up under a strong hand ride, had the rider fumble his crop outside the sixteenth-pole but regained it by pinning it to his chest, continued to
battle outside of the runner-up under a strong hand ride to the wire and narrowly prevailed. SUMMER TO REMEMBER was asked leaving the gate and
went to the front, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way with company to his outside, vied inside on the far turn, was given
his cue outside the quarter-pole, spun into the two path cornering for home, lost the advantage while put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, fought on
well into the final furlong, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, dueled with the winner to the wire and just missed while able to get the
place. MALTHAEL went three then two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, came under urging late on the backstretch, vied in the two
path while ridden along on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch then lost touch with the leaders, chased the top two in the final furlong and kept on
willingly to secure the show. BLUE LOU BOYLE (IRE) was rated on the inside, saved ground while let out on the final turn then was asked nearing the
five-sixteenths, came off the rail into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. STANFORD (IRE) checked when put in tight against
the rail early and fell back, saved ground on the first turn, settled off the rail on the backstretch, went two then three wide on the far turn, was roused outside
the quarter-pole then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. JUNKANOO broke a bit slow, went three wide on the first turn, was
reserved at the back on the outside, came under urging while three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend, spun five wide into the
stretch and failed to respond.

EVVIE JETS established the front after the start crossing initially to the three path before WICKED HAPPY eased off to allow clearance to the hedge under
the finish the line the first time, showed the way along the inside through the first turn before settling into a comfortable rhythm in the two path down the
backstretch through sensible splits under close attendance from NOW YUS CANT LEAVE to the outside but facing very little pressure, tucked inside
through the far turn and had that rival intensify the prompting from the outside through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the inside
straightened away, edged away under a drive and held well to the finish kept busy to the end. SALIT settled two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack,
tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun three wide into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the eighth pole
three paths finding a seam vacated by the backing away SYNONYMOUS, offered up a mild kick to rally on through getting up by a neck for the place
honors. COALITION BUILDING broke out at the start bumping NOW YUS CANT LEAVE into SUFFRAGETTE, tracked the pace along the inside from mid
pack, advanced to be just off the pace through the far turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down angled out four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on through to the finish and was along for the show honors. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE got bumped at the start by
COALITION BUILDING and in turn bumped SUFFRAGETTE, raced forwardly placed three then two wide attending the leader to the outside early on before
advancing to apply pressure through the far turn coming under urging inside the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and
was outfinished in the late stages. WOW broke a half a beat slow and was taken in hand at the start when losing her lane to WICKED HAPPY coming
outwards, raced just off the inside into the first turn before spinning three then four wide midway as SUFFRAGETTE did the same directly in front, chased
three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, made ground
outside through the stretch to the finish albeit while staying on one paced to the wire. WICKED HAPPY broke out at the start taking over the lane of WOW,
showed the way early on reluctantly and was eased off along the hedge once EVVIE JETS made a claim for the front past the wire for the initial time, settled
tracking that rival along the inside through the first turn and then from the two path from that point onward, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
angled out five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SYNONYMOUS three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, angled out six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. SUFFRAGETTE got bumped at the start by NOW YUS CANT
LEAVE due to pressure from COALITION BUILDING, who broke outwards, chased two to three wide under a ride from three furlongs out, went four wide at
the head of the stretch and tired. SATCH saved ground near the rear of the field, came under light coaxing with seven-sixteenths to run, lost ground in the
far turn growing detached at the tail of the field, cornered three wide into upper stretch tired, and was eased through to the finish.

Footnotes
SUPPLY AND DEMAND was last to commence, bumped with a foe shortly after the start and was forced in, angled out at the rear under urging, moved in
while well back at the nine-sixteenths, was roused in the three path on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed crop
while remaining on his inside lead and closed strongly down the middle of the track to get up at the wire. AIR SHOW was hustled from the start, showed
speed on the inside of two foes then chased the pace, went two then three wide under a strong hand ride on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch,
continued in dogged pursuit of the leading duo into the final furlong then took the advantage, led under the crop into the final forty yards, had the rider put
away the crop at that point then was surprised by the presence of the winner on the outside, had the reins shaken at him when the rider realized the danger
too late and was denied on the line. LIKEABLE bumped soundly with TRASH TALKER at the start, showed good speed while hustled then contested the
pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that foe on the turn, spun into the two path under pressure at the quarter-pole, fought on
under a drive into the final furlong but was outfinished while able to get the show. TRASH TALKER bumped soundly with a LIKEABLE at the start, disputed
the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, cornered three wide into the stretch under a drive, battled into the final furlong and weakened. SIX
PACK was urged along off the pace, moved out midway down the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, dropped
back while remaining on his inside lead into the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead at that point and tired. DAGGERBOARD bumped with SUPPLY
AND DEMAND shortly after the start, drifted out significantly near the five-eighths, dropped in late on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the rail on
the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond.

from just off the pace coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, came in switching leads straightened away into
the stretch and bumped TOERIS, rallied to take command inside the three-sixteenths, got collared inside the eighth pole and ran on to chase the winner

putting one another in tight, showed the way coaxed along from the two path under some pressure from FULL COUNT FELICIA to the outside, got set down
taking the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front near the three-sixteenths and tired. MORE THAN VOWS hustled from the start, got put in tight

Footnotes
SUE ELLEN MISHKIN pressed the pace on the outside then in mostly the three path on the turn, took over while put to a right-handed crop into upper
stretch, kicked clear when switching to the proper lead outside the furlong marker then swapped to a left-handed crop, drew away under the crop into the
final sixteenth then was placed under a hand ride to the wire while much the best. ROYAL CURRENCY was fractious in the gate, established a forward
position under urging, chased inside early on the turn, moved to the two path just inside the five-sixteenths, was driven four wide into the stretch and earned
the place while no match for the winner. CARAGATE bumped with DOC DOC ROCK at the start, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn,
turned into the stretch under a drive and was along for the show. HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY was bumped at the start and forced in, recovered well then
showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path early on the turn then dropped closer to the rail, was asked under
heavy threat coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch and weakened. DOC DOC ROCK bumped with CARAGATE at
the start, chased the pace on the inside of a foe, went four wide on the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and came up empty. ACE UP HER
SLEEVE chased the pace on the outside, dropped back with a half-mile to run, went five wide on the turn and capitulated. ALICIA'S WAY was last to
commence, raced at the rear while ridden along, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. OUR TINY DANCER
broke in and bumped with a foe, was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn and failed to respond. MAMA SAID NO became
fractious in the gate, was bumped at the start and forced into another foe, raced towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. CLASSIC
VINMAN was ridden along on the far outside, bore out from the six path to the around the nine path on the turn, came ten wide into the stretch and showed
little.

Footnotes
PURE BODE broke in at the start, was placed to a light rating hold and settled chasing along the inside from the pocket, remained patiently handled along
the hedge until set down angled two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied to engage the top embattled pair nearing the sixteenth marker, took over
command inside that station and edged away to the finish to prevail. MY LIPS ARE SEALED stumbled at the start, raced three then two wide forwardly
placed through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside four then three paths off the rail down the backstretch, then tucked to the two path
through the far turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive dueling through the stretch with MOPOLKA when overtaken by the top
one just inside the sixteenth pole, then ran on to win the battle for the place honors. MOPOLKA showed the way in hand along the inside under some
prompting to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, dug in dueling through to the finish, got collared a
sixteenth out, then kept on but lost the battle for the place honors while just preserving the show. CARA'S DREAMER chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. MORE GLITTER broke out at the start bumping
PRETTY CLEVER, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response.
CHOOSE HAPPINESS three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes.
FREEDOM MACHINE three then two wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide under coaxing, went eight wide into upper stretch and offered
no rally. UNICORN SALLY chased along the inside and then just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and offered
no response. PRETTY CLEVER bumped at the start by MORE GLITTER, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide
for home and weakened. MASTEROF THE TUNES four then three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and weakened. DELLA LUTE saved ground at the tail of the field under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside for home and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MATTA was well spotted just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail while asked inside the five-sixteenths, was driven three wide into the
stretch, chased behind the leading duo into the final furlong then moved out from behind those foes and closed determinedly to go by the embattled leaders
late and prevail. SHEKKY SHEBAZ broke very sharply, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, bobbled while asked in
the two path at the quarter-pole, lost the lead at that juncture, dug in gamely while battling inside of NOBLE EMOTION in upper stretch, bumped with that
foe outside the furlong marker, continued the battle, brushed with NOBLE EMOTION nearing the sixteenth-pole and narrowly bested that foe for the place
but was caught by the winner. NOBLE EMOTION pressed the pace on the outside, tracked in the three path on the turn, took the lead in the four path into
the stretch, battled outside of SHEKKY SHEBAZ while put to a drive, drifted in outside the furlong marker then bumped with the aforementioned foe,
continued the spirited tussle, brushed with SHEKKY SHEBAZ coming to the sixteenth-pole, fought with that opponent to the wire and just missed the place
while able to get the show. COMPETITIVE SAINT was restless in the gate, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, spun five five wide
into the stretch under a drive, pursued the dueling leaders while outside into the final furlong then was carried out by the winner and lacked the needed kick.
DURESS settled at the rear of the field, raced inside under coaxing early on the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch,
moved further out while asked for his best around the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. LOMU broke a bit slow then bumped with a foe,
settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused four wide on the turn then came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. JOKER ON JACK was
restless in the gate, broke a half-step slow, settled towards the back, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. THIS RACE WAS RUN
AFTER AN EIGHTEEN MINUTE WEATHER DELAY WHERE THE HORSES WAITED WHILE ALREADY SADDLED IN THE PADDOCK

SHASHASHAKEMEUP and bobbled appearing to be clipped behind by WIND OF CHANGE, established the front and showed the way lightly coaxed along
in the two path, tucked inside through the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, drifted out under a drive eight paths to the finish under a right handed
crop, however left hand rein encouragement and held well to the finish. MY BOY TATE hustled from the gate, chased along the inside, came under coaxing
just off the inside five-sixteenths from home, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to the finish to chase the winner home while clear for the
place honors. FOOLISH GHOST reluctant to load prior to the start, broke on top and was put to a light rating hold to settle four paths off the inside in closest
aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive following the winner out through the stretch to the finish despite that rival having clearance and weakened in the late stages while along for the show
honors. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) got bumped at the start by WONDRWHERECRAIGIS and clipped that rival in behind and in turn bumped BON RAISON
into SHASHASHAKEMEUP pinching that rival out, raced briefly three paths off the inside before tipping to the five path down the backstretch, tucked three
wide through the turn, advanced steadily outside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung five to six wide for home and weakened in the stretch.
SHASHASHAKEMEUP pinched at the start due to pressure outside, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four
wide for home and tired. BON RAISON got bumped at the start by WIND OF CHANGE due to pressure from WONDRWHERECRAIGIS, and in turn pinched
back SHASHASHAKEMEUP, chased three to four wide under a ride from midway on the turn, went five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
WELL DONE WEST tracked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, took the advantage outside the quarter-pole, was put
to the left-handed crop in upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, extended the advantage into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging.
GOOD CULTURE bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow, dropped well behind, saved ground under urging on the turn, moved out under a
right-handed crop in upper stretch, came further out when switched to a left-handed crop into the final furlong, swapped back to the right-handed crop while
gaining outside the sixteenth-pole and closed well but was too late while clear for the place. VIKRAM broke out and bumped with a rival at the start, was
hustled to the lead, vied inside while asked on the turn, lost the lead to the winner outside the quarter-pole, fought with that foe under a drive into upper
stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. PROFUSION dropped back while urged along, went three wide on the
turn, swung out seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. LITTERBOX settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn then driven four
wide into the stretch and came up empty. APEX PREDATOR was hustled from the start, showed speed then chased the pace, dropped back passing the
half-mile pole, fell further back in the two path on the turn and retreated. CENTAVO was hustled from the start the urged along on the outside, went four
then five wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off. TAINO settled towards the inside, moved out significantly near the
half-mile pole, was urged five then six wide on the turn and also faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
