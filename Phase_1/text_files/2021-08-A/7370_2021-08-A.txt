Footnotes
PACIFIC COAST prompted the pace three then two wide into the turn, made the lead near the five sixteenth marker, was shaken up entering the stretch
then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best while being ridden out. CANDLELIGHT HOURS well placed, rallied late five wide and got up for
second. FLATTER HER AGAIN was in tight leaving the chute, trailed into the stretch, lacked room nearing the furlong marker, dropped along the rail and
finished determinedly. SQUID pressed the early pace two wide, dropped back on the turn, came on again through upper stretch then was outfinished.
PROPHETESS had good early speed along the inside, shifted out to the four path entering the stretch and faded late. STARLIT SECRET away alertly, set
the pace along the inside until mid turn, had speed until mid stretch then weakened.

HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE was never far back early, rallied in the stretch three wide, closed determinedly and prevailed in a head bob. A SMILE A DAY was
away alertly and quickly made the pace, remained clear in mid stretch, held grudgingly and just missed. ATTITUDE had good position on the inside and
finished willingly in a good effort. GRAZIA WHO broke outward quickly recovered, pressed the pace until the top of the stretch and weakened slightly. SILKY
TASSELS showed little and trailed.

SONGSTOPSHELF was well handled on the inside just off the pace, angled out in the stretch, closed stoutly and drew off under mild urging to win going
away. GETOUTOFTHEHAREM raced mid pack early, swung four wide in the stretch, was no match for the winner but was second best. J J'S FANCY raced
close up until mid stretch, then weakened, late. WELLOILEDCAT allowed to settle early, passed tiring rivals while no threat. PAYTON PRETTY set the pace
until the top of the stretch, then came up empty. SWEET EMPIRE pressed the pace for three quarters, then gave way in the stretch. ZVOLUME showed
little and was outrun.

early, rallied in the stretch three wide and finished well to be up for place. LITTLE BLAKER had good position on the inside, finished willingly on the rail and
put in a good effort. PRIVATE DRIVE chased the winner and weakened slightly late. HANSENATION was allowed to settle and failed to menace.
TOTELLYOUTHETRUTH pressed the pace three wide early and was through after a half.

Footnotes
CIRCUS RINGS prompted the pace two wide, made the lead entering the far turn, drifted from the two path to the ten path under steady left handed urging
and just lasted. SALLY STRONG stalked the pace, slipped through inside entering the far turn, dropped back a bit entering the stretch, altered course to the
five path nearing the furlong marker, was carried out to the twelve, closed late and just missed. MARKET SUCCESS vied for the lead three wide, loomed
boldly in upper stretch, was carried out by the winner through deep stretch squeezed in the final strides and checked through the wire. MOONLIT MISSION
unhurried early, found her best stride late in the seven path. BALLROOM BLITZ raced near the outside and went evenly. HERE COMES JIGS was no
factor. GRIZABELLA moved up three wide nearing the second turn then came up empty. TOTALLY OBSESSED broke in front, set the pace to the three
eighths pole then weakened. DRILLIT raced wide and was no factor. RIPROARING showed little. CALI DREAM was outrun. THE STEWARDS POSTED
THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDERS OF SALLY STRONG AND MARKET SUCCESS LODGED CLAIMS OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CIRCUS
RINGS FOR INTERFERENCE NEARING THE WIRE. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

fought back gamely two wide to get back up in time. FOREWARNED allowed to settle, loomed boldly two then three wide into the stretch, surged inside the
winner to gain a narrow lead late then was outfinished. I WANNA WIN raced wide, loomed boldly four wide into the far turn, kept pressure the balance of the
trip and finished with good courage. WICKED WARRIOR drifted out to the middle of the racetrack while under a strong hold soon after the start, dropped
back on the far turn then came on again late. MOBIL SOLUTION close up from the start, loomed boldly along the inside while in the four path before a half,
battled through the far turn then came up empty. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE was no factor. SPIN DOCTOR failed to menace. COINCIDENTALLY set the early
