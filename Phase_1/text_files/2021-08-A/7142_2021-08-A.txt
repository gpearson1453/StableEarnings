Footnotes
RED EQUINOX stalked the pace, was hustled along the rail through the turn, rallied along the fence, bid a 16th out and drew clear under a hand ride.
LOADED QUESTION forced the pace, dueled briefly on the backstretch, rebid early turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was passed a 16th out but
held place. TRADING BAY ducked in at the start, showed speed, dueled briefly on the backstretch and led into the turn, entertained a second challenge
from the initial dueler, stayed even on the turn, drifted out approaching the top of the stretch, lost ground but finished with determination. SHE'S GOT
MOVES stalked the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely to no avail. OLD SECRETS settled off the
pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, moved back to the rail in the stretch and tendered a mild rally. CAPTURE THE MOMENT
stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
FIRST EMPIRE forced the pace, dueled two-wide on the turn, gained a narrow lead upper stretch then drove clear and held sway under a hand ride.
SILENT FAREWELL settled in mid pack, was hustled two and three-wide on the turn, encountered traffic upper stretch, maneuvered his way to a clear path
and finished with determination. DIAMOND CITY stalked the pace, bid three-wide late turn, was lugging in and shoed from both right and left-handed whip
and was taken in hand late. SILENT RUNNER bumped INNUENDO leaving the gate, pressed the pace, came two and three-wide through the turn, chased
into the stretch and finished gamely. POINT TO THE STARS raced in mid pack, chased three and four-wide on the turn, rallied outside but failed to menace.
DAY TRIPPER pressed the early pace, stalked from the rail on the turn then finished evenly. COO BIRD broke inward and settled off the pace, closed along
the rail on the turn but never reached contention. POT COMMITTED had speed, dueled into the turn, was headed upper stretch and gave way grudgingly.
INNUENDO bumped with horses breaking from both sides, settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the turn but lacked a closing response.
AORISTOS broke outward and bumped INNUENDO, settled well off the pace, was hustled on the turn but lacked a rally.

Footnotes
AVOMAN was two-wide at the back while always in contention, angled out to be three-wide on the far turn where he commenced his bid, got his head in
front just past the 1/4 pole, dueled into the stretch and proved best in the final furlong. TRUFFLE KING tracked the pace while racing two-wide, began to
press the leader heading into the far turn, dueled while racing between foes into the stretch, ducked inwards at the furlong marker and was a clear second
best. H C HOLIDAY stalked the pace while racing on the inside, angled to the four-path turning for home but was no match for the top two. DERZKII set the
pace while saving ground, dueled on the far turn, had to check a furlong out as TRUFFLE KING ducked into his path and weakened. A STEWARD'S
INQUIRY AS WELL AS A CLAIM OF FOUL FROM THE RIDER OF DERZKII AGAINST TRUFFLE KING RESULTED IN TRUFFLE KING BEING
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FOURTH

Footnotes
SIR SEAMUS sprinted clear, set a reserved pace then held sway under a hand ride. MR. DIFFLEY stalked the pace, closed late turn, launched a
determined drive and was gaining late. DESOLATOR settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, was all out in the stretch
and was closing steadily. DECIMATOR, pinched back at the start, settled in mid pack, closed two-wide on the turn then finished evenly. HOLYFIELD stalked
the pace, was hustled from the rail late turn but evened out in deep stretch. WORA, in range, was hustled five-wide late turn but never reached contention.
BEN LOMOND settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the turn then evened out in the final 16th. MAMBOINTHEFOREST raced in mid pack, was
in tight at the top of the stretch then lacked a rally. PRINCE OF THIEVES settled off the pace, was hustled five and six-wide on the turn but was never in
contention. JUST LIKE LARRY pressed the pace into the turn, was hustled along then flattened out in the stretch. PUGIN broke outward, stalked the pace
late backstretch, was hustled four-wide on the turn, dropped back approaching the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LION'S GOLDENHEART stalked the early leader, up to press on the backside taken back and re-bid on the far turn, had a clear advantage into the stretch
and held on, his margin of victory diminishing rapidly late. BIRCHMOUNT RD ducked out soon after the start and trailed the field, stayed inside until
swinging out into the six path turning for home and closing widest while laying in down the lane, up for place and gaining quickly on the winner late.
KOSMONAVT off the pace and three to two wide around the first turn, came three to five wide circling foes on the far turn and out in the five path turning for
home, closing well but not matching the energy of the place finisher, but besting the rest to that one's inside. SWEEPIN HARD off slowly, rush up to three
wide press into the first turn, dropped back to chase outside two rivals, moved up four wide at the quarter pole and out in the five path turning for home,
unable to match the energy of the place and show closers but outrunning the remainder for a minor award. ENGLISH CLASSIC two wide chasing on the first
turn, between rivals in behind the leaders on the far turn, in range down lane but outkicked in the final sixteenth. AMMUNITION off the pace, asked for run
two to three wide on the far turn and had open space in front of him in the two path in midstretch but could not muster a rally. HIGHLAND SOCIETY led
early, was stalked and pressed by the winner and succumbed to that one's pressure midway on the far turn, retreating down the stretch. HELL BENT
chased along the inside, was hard ridden at the quarter pole but had no response.

SOUPER STONEHENGE got out to set a clear pace, took some pressure from NOT SO QUIET late on the turn but was able to repel that bid before holding
off a closing PINK LLOYD in the final 1/16th. PINK LLOYD raced between foes in the early stages, had to check past the 3/8ths pole and fell to last briefly
as GREEN LIGHT GO began to stop in front of him, angled to the outside past the 1/4 pole for clear running room and rallied well down the outside. NOT
SO QUIET tracked the early pace, raced three-wide into the turn, made a bid and put some pressure on SOUPER STONEHENGE past the 1/4 pole but was
shaken off early in the stretch and gave way. CASH DIVIDEND stalked the pace from the inside, followed the eventual winner through the turn and chased
in vain down the stretch. EMBOLDEN raced last in the early stages, was asked on the turn while racing three-wide, was four-wide into the stretch and had
no rally. GREEN LIGHT GO raced between foes early, was two-wide into the turn, began to weaken at the 3/8ths pole and finished flatly.

MUNNYFOR RO was off slowly and settled in mid pack, closed four-wide on the far turn, bid a furlong out, drove clear and held under steady handling.
EMMELINE forced the pace, bid into the far turn, dueled, led at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out and chased to the end. IL MALOCCHIO
raced in striking range, stalked three-wide to the far turn, pressed the issue to the stretch and finished gamely. YOUENS settled in mid pack, was hustled
three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch and rallied gamely. CURLIN'S CATCH raced in mid pack, was hustled from the rail on the far turn, was
blocked at the top of the stretch then finished under a mild rally. MISS MARIE stalked the pace, chased hard two-wide on the far turn then evened out in
deep stretch. ERASMO'S GIRL settled off the pace, saved ground throughout but never reached contention. LORENA set a pressured pace, dueled on the
far turn, was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. JILLI MARIE hopped slightly leaving the gate and was rated off the pace, closed along the rail
and two-wide through the final turn then flattened out in the stretch. LADY MOONSHINE, in range, chased into the far turn but backed away under a ride
and lacked a rally.

AMALFI COAST settled in mid pack, was hustled along the rail and two-wide through the turn, moved back to the rail a furlong out, rallied gamely and was
up with a late effort. JEANIE B (GB) showed early speed but was headed midway through the backstretch, pressed the leader on the turn, regained the lead
a furlong out but was caught near the wire. CHANGE OF CONTROL, in range, stalked two and three-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch, launched an
all out drive and was gaining to the end. LADY GRACE settled off the pace, ride the rail on the turn and was all out through the stretch. FAIRYWREN raced
in mid pack, came two and three-wide through the turn, was blocked upper stretch and finished gamely in vain. SISTER PEACOCK led into the turn, set a
pressured pace, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was headed a furlong out and gave way. LEAD GUITAR was away slowly because of an unfair start
and settled off the pace, came three and four-wide on the turn but failed to menace. JEANNIE'S BEEPBEEP raced in mid pack, came four-wide through the
turn but had no closing response. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE REGARDING LEAD GUITAR DEEMED THAT LEAD
GUITAR HAD RECEIVED AN UNFAIR START WHICH REQUIRES A REFUND FOR PARIMUTUAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING MULTI-RACE AND
STRAIGHT WAGERS. THE RACE FAVOURITE WILL BE SUBSTITUTED FOR LEAD GUITAR in ONE RACE EXOTIC WAGERS.
