Footnotes
TABERNACLE sprinted clear from the break, set a reserved pace, then was all out to hold in the stretch. ALTERNATIVE VIEW settled off the pace, closed
on the backstretch, chased on the far turn and angled out out four-wide approaching the stretch then finished under a determined drive. IF SIX WAS NINE
stalked the pace two-wide, was hustled angling out three-wide late turn then finished gamely. MATTHAUS broke outward and was steadied, stalked the
pace from the rail, chased into the stretch but evened out in the final furlong. MUSKOKA LADY settled off the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn but
never reached contention. NORTHERN CROSS raced from off the pace, closed to mid pack on the backstretch, was hustled along the rail through the far
turn but lacked a closing response. SADLERS DELITE got away a step slowly, stalked the pace on the first turn, backed away on the far turn and lacked a
rally.

Footnotes
BETWIXTING, steadied at the outset, settled off the pace, closed angling from the rail to three-wide on the turn, tipped out at the top of the stretch,
responded smartly and went by the leader in the late stages. SPANISH BALLERINA set a pressured pace, moved clear mid turn, was hustled in the stretch
but failed to contain the winner in deep stretch. FACT CHECKING raced in mid pack, was hustled two to four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch
and finished gamely. ROMAN D'ORO settled in mid pack, was hustled from the rail late turn then closed gamely in vain. SAV ducked in at the start, pressed
the pace, was hustled three-wide on the turn and was game to the end. ISHIYAYA pressed the pace, was hustled two-wide on the turn but flattened out in
the final furlong.

the issue, drew even early backstretch, battled from the rail on the turn, was determined in the stretch but weakened near the wire. ARI GOLD
SPEEDWAGN raced in mid pack, was hustled and angled out from two to four-wide on the turn, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages.

BATTLE OF YORKTOWN stalked the pace from the rail, bid with several others upper stretch, drew clear then held under a drive. LIL BIT GANGSTA
pressed the pace, came three-wide through both turns, challenged upper stretch but was outfinished. STRIKE A BEAT raced in mid pack, rode the rail
through both turns, chased into the stretch and finished under a determined drive. TRINITY GOLD bumped with GENDRAGON leaving the gate, was rated
off the pace, came three and four-wide through the turn, chased into the stretch and finished gamely. GENDRAGON bumped at the start then settled off the
pace, closed two to four-wide on the far turn then chased through the stretch. JMR PURE SENSATION settled in mid pack, came two and three-wide on the
far turn, encountered traffic in the stretch rallied belatedly. TWIRLING MOON staked the pace in hand, came two and three-wide through the far turn, ran
into traffic upper stretch, found a path but had too much to do. SIAKAM bumped with CARROBIO leaving the gate, forced the pace from the rail, bid upper
stretch but quickly gave way. BLUE SNOW settled off the pace, saved ground, chased into the stretch but evened out in the late stages. CARROBIO
bumped leaving the gate but showed a turn of speed, set a pressured pace, was smarmed upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
IN PURSUIT stalked the early leader down the backside, took over without urge midway on the turn, had a clear advantage in upper stretch and maintained
a safe margin of victory to the wire. SHISHKA took off the early leader to chase the top pair along the rail, tipped out at the quarter pole when the winner
took over the lead and had dead aim on that rival but couldn't get any closer, settling for second best. DEVINE DANCING sped to the front, stalked and
pressed by the eventual winner, gave way to that rival midway on the turn but fought on doggedly and held the show spot down to the wire. TRICKERATION
broke out and bumped a rival at the start, settled in along the rail in midpack, went rail to three wide to midstretch and her rally levelled off inside the seventy
yard pole. BABY DRIVER chased in the two path down the backside, moved up two to four wide on the turn and out in the six path turning for home, her
rally stalling in the final stages. CANADIAN ESSENCE was bumped hard by a rival at the break, chased the frontrunners along the inside and her mild rally
levelled off in the final stages. AUDITION off the pace early, rallied in the three path around the turn but could not sustain her bid and was going up and
down in the stretch. MOONLIGHT MELODY broke out from her outside post at the break, trailed while moving over to the inside into the turn, was held up in
traffic a few times on the bend and closed mildly along the fence down the lane. SIMPLY A ZOOMER off the pace, circled up three to four wide from the rear
on the turn and was out in the six path turning for home but ran out of run at the sixteenth pole. BEST BREW sat along the rail in midpack, was roused on
the turn but had no response. STREET TOPPER brushed the gate at the start, was five wide near the rear trying to rally on the turn and very wide at the top
of the stretch, fading from there. ROSES LITTLE GIRL broke slow from her inside post, moved up mildly along the fence but ran out of energy by midway on
the turn.

BELLA NINA bumped with PINO IN A PURSE leaving the gate, closed to mid pack, chased two and three-wide on the far turn, rallied gamely and was up
late under a drive. MAKE NO MISTAKE bumped with PINO IN A PURSE at the start, stalked the pace, was hustled two-wide on the far turn, bid in the final
furlong and drew clear but was caught in the late stages. CHEEKY PINT, in range, was hustled from the rail on the far turn, was blocked upper stretch,
veered out then closed with a vengeance. ALICE'S WAR led early, moved clear through the turn, set a reserved pace, was passed in the final furlong and
chased to the wire. PINO IN A PURSE bumped with horses from both sides, stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail on the far turn, dropped back on the
far turn then came on again in the final 16th. WEST PAW was rated off the pace, closed along the rail on the far turn then finished gamely in vain. LUCKY
GIRASOL was away slowly and settled off the pace, chased three and four-wide on the far turn but lacked a closing response.

PRINCESS was off slowly and settled in mid pack, closed into the turn, came two to four-wide through the turn, led upper stretch but failed to stave off the
winner in the final yards. SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA forced the pace, chased four then three-wide on the turn and finished under a determined drive. REGAL
BILLEE settled in mid pack, in range into the turn, chased four and five-wide on the turn then finished gamely. TENPENNY NAIL, in the front lines early,
dropped back, closed along the rail through the turn, then chased into the stretch and rallied along the fence. BEARTHESTORM showed speed, held a short
lead into the turn, dueled, was headed upper stretch, chased , then evened out late. MUSICALLY INCLINED was off slowly and settled well back, circled
five-wide on the turn but evened out in the final 16th. ALIYAH'S ACTION was prominent early, dropped back nearing the turn, raced along the rail and
two-wide to the stretch, chased into the stretch but failed to menace. OSVETA raced forwardly, dropped back on the turn and lacked a rally. A BIT OF

QUEEN BEACH raced in mid pack, saved ground, closed on the far turn, launched a strong stretch rally and swept to the lead in the final 16th, driving.
ROSA'S SOUL dueled, drew away on the far turn, was passed in the final 16th and held place. VIANI stalked the pace, was hustled from the rail and
two-wide on the final turn then finished under a determined drive. GIGI'S GIFT was steadied leaving the gate then settled in mid pack, chased three-wide
late on the final turn and finished gamely. BLU SKY SUNRISE settled off the pace, was hustled angling from the rail to third path on the far turn, chased into
the stretch but did not menace. SEA OF DIAMONDS stalked the pace, was hustled two and three-wide on the far turn, chased into the stretch then finished
evenly. QUIET ASCOT had speed, dueled to the far turn, dropped back and lacked a further response. ELFIN FOREST broke outward and was steadied,
settled off the pace, was hustled two to four-wide on the far turn then did not menace in the stretch. CLIFF'S HEAD raced in mid pack, was hustled three
and four-wide on the far turn but never reached contention. EVERYMINITEVRYHOUR broke inward and was well back in the traffic entering the clubhouse
turn, was checked sharply behind a rival and settled off the pace, was hustled three and four-wide on the far turn but did not present a menace in the
stretch. RULE THE SEA was steadied leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a rally.
