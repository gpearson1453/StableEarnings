stretch, surged three wide late and proved best in a stiff drive. BERTRADA saved ground, dug in determinedly along the rail through the final sixteenth and
just missed. JAIL HOUSE CODE broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished between horses. DR KAAK had good early speed three

Footnotes
PALTARREVENGE always within striking distance, shifted out to the six path entering the stretch, closed determinedly through the final sixteenth and was
along in time. THIRTYSILVERPIECES had speed from the start three wide, went up to contest the lead before a half, dueled into the stretch, edged clear
then couldn't hold off the winner. CARISSIMO allowed to settle, loomed boldly three wide into the far turn, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished.
DAWOOD trailed into the far turn, swung wide and closed a gap late in the eight path. DEBDURITE pressed the pace two wide, matched strides for the lead
into the far turn and into the stretch then weakened late. STAR HAWK hopped at the start then failed to menace. TROPICAL CYCLONE away alertly, set a
pressured pace for four and one half furlongs then stopped.

ITZAFRIENDSHIPSHOT never far back, angled out to the six path entering the stretch, surged to make the lead in deep stretch and finished full of run to
win going away. QUARANTINA away alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. ANCIENT BROWN vied for the lead along
the inside into the stretch, shifted to the five path then went evenly. SHELLEY'S GEM with the second flight three wide, loomed boldly on the far turn, kept
pressure until deep stretch hen was outfinished. JLO CAN DANCE drifted out past mid track at the start and was no threat. UNWRITTEN chased the pace
two wide into the far turn then gave way. EMPRESS ALEXANDRA stumbled inward at the start, lost contact with her field before a half, was distanced and
jogged to wire.

shifted to the six path for the drive then went evenly. DOUBLE D'S REVENGE chased the pace from the inside into the stretch and faded late. JETTIN

MONTAUK COVE away alertly, set all the pace, shook clear in the stretch and lasted under strong handling. ADHHAR stalked the pace from the inside, dug
in late and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage along the rail. PLAY BALL chased the winner into the turn, drew closer two wide nearing the
quarter pole then leveled off. CUMBER had good early speed, dropped back on the turn then passed tiring rivals. PAT'S KARMA with the second flight three
wide, failed to respond. ICONIC trailed down the backstretch, advanced on the outside on the turn and into the stretch, suffered and injury, was pulled up
and vanned off.

Footnotes
DIVULGENCE dueled for the lead five then two wide into the stretch, responded readily when set down and drew off to win as much the best under a brisk
hand ride. MAKING ME CRAZY slow early, closed willingly in the five path through the stretch and finished clear for second. CENTRIST chased the pace
four then three wide and went evenly. HURRICANE NATION was hustled along from the start, settled with the second flight along the rail then lacked the
needed response. LADY'S BOY dueled for the lead four wide then along the inside through the turn and weakened in the stretch. MINE'S DIALED IN was
bumped then squeezed at the start and failed to reach contention. FAMOUS N FLASHY bumped at the start, matched strides for the lead three wide, was in
tight causing his rider to steady near the half mile pole, had speed into the stretch then flattened out. FRONTIER MESA was a sharp threat from the start,
also in tight near the half mile pole, steadied then dropped out of it.

bumped at the top of the stretch and proved best by the narrowest of margins. BOSS BEAR sprinted up the rail to make the lead before a half, maintained a
narrow advantage into the stretch, drifted out a bit bumping the winner at the top of the stretch and just missed. ZALINSKY stalked the pace and went
evenly. PERFECT SENSE failed to menace. REINSURE bore in at the start bumping the winner, had speed into the stretch then gave way. IRIE ISLAND
