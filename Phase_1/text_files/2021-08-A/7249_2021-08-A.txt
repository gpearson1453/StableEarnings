Footnotes
C DUB broke readily, prompted the pace three wide in early stages, continued to press the issue outside a rival through the turn, shook clear in upper
stretch and steadily widened under firm encouragement. DEVIL'S TEETH, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset, dueled inside the eventual
winner to upper stretch but proved no match in late stages. ROLLS ROYCE DEAL, urged between foes prompting the pace in the opening quarter, dropped
off the leaders racing into the turn, drifted out nearing upper stretch but turned back a rival entering the lane to prevail for a share. SEEK N JUSTICE settled
off the second flight racing off the inside to the turn, shifted out four wide while being prompted to make a brief advance nearing upper stretch but had no
closing response. PAPA CABALLERO dropped out of contention early.

Footnotes
MUSKYMAN was urged prompting a rival's pace racing to the backstretch, edged forward to a narrow advantage along the inside racing into the far turn,
dueled for command inside a rival while being headed midstretch but repelled that foe in the closing stages under firm left handed pressure to gamely
prevail. YESTERYEAR tracked just off the first flight three wide between foes to the backstretch, steadily moved to terms with the pacesetter in that path
racing through the far turn, moved to strike the front midstretch but couldn't match the winner's final kick. GONE CRUISING settled last racing to the far turn,
split foes four wide racing into upper stretch and displayed some late interest to gain a share. READS LANDING was rated just off the second flight near the
inside to the backstretch, was prompted to gain some position advancing between foes racing into the far turn but flattened out late. TWILITE LIASON,
urged inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening half, gave way early. PASSTHECAT, caught four wide racing into the first turn tracking just off the
leaders, continued in that path to the far turn and steadily faded into the lane. RUN AWAY FLASH settled off the second flight racing to the backstretch, was
caught four wide racing through the far turn, was fanned five wide nearing the lane and steadily faded.

BRAD'S TIME bobbled slightly brushing MINE MY TIME at the start, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace into the turn gaining a narrow advantage,
then responded to firm pressure to go clear through the stretch. DRIED PEPPER, urged between foes prompting the pace, couldn't match the winner racing
into upper stretch but proved best of the others. BIG LEAGUE BENNY switched out four wide early tracking off the first flight, then continued in that path to
late stages while continuing well enough to earn a share. SOMETHING SUPER settled last, shifted to the inside entering the turn to make some brief
progress inside foes but flattened out in the drive. BAYOU PROSPECTOR, in touch with the leaders three wide prompting the pace to the turn, gave way
early. MINE MY TIME tracked off the first flight near the inside and emptied out between foes racing into upper stretch.

FABLES LOVE AFFAIR tracked the leaders three wide in second flight racing through the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path to challenge for
command in upper stretch, wrested the advantage nearing the furlong marker, then responded to hold SHE BEGAN AGAIN to the end under firm
encouragement. The latter, reserved along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out four wide nearing upper stretch gathering momentum, loomed outside
the winner in that path in the final sixteenth but was outkicked. SUMMER LOVIN settled outside a rival in the last flight in the opening stages, angled five
wide entering the lane and continued well enough to earn a share. M AND M GIRL angled to the inside tracking off the first flight and faded racing into the
turn. INDAWIN led the second flight on a narrow margin between foes tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the turn, made some brief
progress between foes and faded into upper stretch. LASTING LIGHT, urged to dispute the pace inside rivals, dueled for command into upper stretch and
gave out leaving the furlong marker. ELEGANT CRICKET, urged forcing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into the turn and gave way
midstretch.

SHABAM, in touch with the pacesetter between foes attending the issue to the backstretch, was eased off the leaders while shifting out three wide racing
into the far turn, pressed the issue in that path, then continued outside a rival racing into upper stretch but edged forward with a sustained response to go
clear under pressure. LADY PHYLLIS, urged inside foes dictating the pace on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, dueled for command through the far
turn into upper stretch but yielded to the winner late. LET'S SKEDADDLE settled last dropping off the first flight racing to the backstretch, never gained
contention. RENTAL POOL, urged three wide prompting the pace in the opening three furlongs, shifted inwards to press the issue between foes into the far
turn and gave way midway through the second bend.

FRIENDLY AND KIND, urged inside rivals disputing the pace racing into the first turn, shook clear midway through the backstretch and steadily widened her
advantage under some mild hand urging. MILA'S DREAM (IRE) angled to the inside early tracking off the second flight, saved ground on the far turn gaining
position and continued along the rail through the stretch to edge a rival for the place honors. MOCHA KISS tracked off the first flight along the inside racing
to the backstretch, gained position inside foes racing into the far turn, tipped out entering upper stretch but couldn't close the gap on the winner while just
missing for second. SNEAKY DIANNE tracked off the second flight outside foes, angled to the inside on the far turn and gained some position while no real
threat. GP'S AMAZING GRACE, caught four wide racing to the first turn prompting the pace, shifted inwards pursuing the pacesetter through the
backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn. YANKEE PRIDE settled near the inside early and never gained contention. GET ONE MORE flashed brief
pace three wide between foes racing to the first turn and faded early. A KISS GOODNIGHT, off slowly, proved no threat. TOURIST LIKE ME flashed brief
pace between foes but was spent early.

Footnotes
FALLEN EMPIRE broke sharply, was prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, continued with a steady bid while being fanned
to the four path racing through the stretch, then took over nearing the sixteenth marker to go clear late under firm handling. DEVIL'S FIRE, urged to the lead
along the inside, dictated the pace on a narrow margin off the rail racing into the turn, shifted out under pressure racing past midstretch but proved no match
when confronted by the winner. LOW TIDE WARNING, a bit outpaced in early stages, angled to the inside on the backstretch, saved ground through the
turn to the lane and edged a rival for a share. TWIRLING ROSES broke outwards bumping GIANT'S GATEWAY, settled off the second flight, then
continued evenly three wide between foes to gain some position. KARALINKA tracked off the first flight three wide between foes, shifted out four wide racing
through the turn and faded into upper stretch. GIANT'S GATEWAY, bumped at the start, tracked off the first flight four wide early, angled inwards entering
the turn and faded between foes into the lane. COUNTRY BRAVE, off slowly, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HESALITTLE SHADY tracked the pacesetter outside a rival under light rating conceding some position to the leader on the backstretch, angled to the rail
racing through the far turn and continued with a steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under pressure. SEATTLE SEE YA was hustled
clear a bit off the rail racing to the backstretch, set the pace off the rail while opening a commanding advantage racing to the far turn, held sway past
midstretch but faltered late. HAVEN'S JOY, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch, switched outside the leaders racing into the
far turn and continued with mild interest in the four path to close the gap in late stages. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK tracked off the second flight off the rail
racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. COMPELLUS dwelt at the start losing contact with the leaders and never menaced thereafter. FISH EYES
stumbled at the start and dropped out early.
