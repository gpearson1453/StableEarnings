BOUND TO BE SMART set the pace from the five path, held good margins through the turn, came under light handling in the final sixteenth and won
handily. GRACEFUL SPIRIT hurried away, sat just off the pace from off the rail, shifted out into the lane but was unable to reach the winner under
encouragement. DEVIL'S STRIKE broke in bumping into ZHAVIA away from the gate, raced three wide leaving the backstretch, chased but was unable to
improve position through the stretch. ZHAVIA bumped leaving the gate, raced four wide into the far turn, and lacked a bid. MISS DIRECTED offered little.

SOLARITY sat in striking position in the three path, tipped four wide approaching the quarter pole, rallied sharply through the stretch and was along in time.
SHE'S DIVINE shadowed the leader under a snug hold early, gained the lead leaving the backstretch, was under attack approaching the stretch, fought on
but was unable to resist. RAIDER raced three wide in the opening turn, tracked the pacesetters through the backstretch, launched a bold two wide bid
leaving the turn but flattened in the final furlong. SARAHS ELEGANCE settled toward the rear outside of SMART FIX and rallied belatedly. INTERESTING
TIMES led the way through the opening turn, contested the pace from between rivals through the backstretch, was overtaken in the far turn then began to
empty out near the quarter pole and continued to fade. SMART FIX allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground but lacked a response when called upon.

Footnotes
LANNY MAC raced near the rear outside, went four wide into the far turn, swung out into the lane gaining closer order, rallied five wide into the stretch, and
finished well to get up. RISING REVOLUTION stalked the dueling pacesetters from the four path, took closer order in the final turn, pushed to the front at
the three sixteenth marker, drifted out late stretch and was caught. MISSY'S PADRAIG away last, saved ground from rail, angled out finding running room at
the quarter pole, rallied three wide into the stretch, flattened out but held show position. FLAT OUT LEADER allowed to settle early, raced three wide in the
turn, drove five wide into the stretch but had no final bid. NEVVARE angled towards to the rail leaving the backstretch, raced in close quarters into the
stretch then angled out and passed tiring. HERE COMES BARNEY dueled through the backstretch outside of DR A TO D, was unable to keep pace with the
field and yielded. DR A TO D hustled inside, was engaged in a duel with HERE COMES BARNEY, inherited the lead with two furlong remaining and had
nothing left in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
GREEK GEEK took command early, repelled bid from EXPLODE at the quarter pole, held gamely to be well clear under steady handling and finished in
record time. EXPLODE raced four wide into the opening turn, tracked outside, prompted action nearing the five sixteenth pole moving up alongside GREEK
GEEK but was no match for the winner in the stretch. PARKING PERMIT tracked inside and finished best of the others. TROOPER JOHN raced five wide
into the opening turn, was never far back through the backstretch, gained outside into the lane and lacked the kick needed. WHISKEY BOUND saved
ground from the two path and passed tiring. SLEW'S BAK prompted the early pace outside of GREEK GEEK, lacked a respond when called upon and
continued to fade. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DOC COPE angled to the rail leaving the backstretch, gained closer order in the final turn, swung out into the lane, rallied steadily outside into stretch and
won driving. ALL THAT GOLD tracked outside early, advanced quickly leaving the final turn, shifted out to the four path, was outkicked by the winner and
inched by late for place. RAILWAY stalked four wide then was brushed leaving the backstretch, fanned three wide through the turn, then moved up
menacingly early stretch, rider lost riding crop and was bested late. LITTLE CHICAGO reserved off the pace outside, gained closer order racing wide into
the lane, rallied five wide and finished with good energy. NOT A DOCTOR broke inward leaving, tracked inside, lodged a rail bid at the head of the lane then
gained the lead with a furlong remaining and gave way grudgingly. PULL THE PIN quickly went to the front, saved ground to the far turn, responded to
looming threat nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken at the head of the stretch and yielded. MARANGO hustled outside early, brushed RAILWAY leaving
the backstretch, raced four wide through the turn, dropped back then faded along the rail. BAKKEN OVERDRIVE lagged early, raced wide into the lane and
failed to threaten. FIRST PRINCE chased the pace three to four wide, moved up alongside PULL THE PIN leaving the backstretch then faded steadily.
MUCHO GRACIAS last away and never reached contention.

Footnotes
INTENT TO STRIKE was quickest to the turn, showed the way through the backstretch, drew clear through the final turn, widened lead through the stretch
when uncovered and was wrapped up. RAIDEN raced in second flight from the four path, encountered traffic at the head of the lane, swung out the rallied
mid track and finished second best. ACE OF DIAMONDS trailed under handling early, rallied belatedly outside and was out kicked for second. FROBISHER
BAY raced four wide into the first turn, rated off the pace outside, gained closer order under urging and flattened with a furlong remaining. GEM ALTA
stalked the pace four to five wide, raced in closest pursuit through the far turn, and faded in the stretch. STEELFORCE reserved in the two path through the
backstretch and lacked a bid when asked. MOROCCAN WARRIOR raced from the rear, encountered traffic into the lane, angled to rail but lacked running
room and continued on evenly. RIVER HOUSE stalked from the two path early and faded steadily on rail. RUCK raced three to four wide into the opening
turn, sat in striking distance through the backstretch and was done early. TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand-timed due to a timer malfunction.
