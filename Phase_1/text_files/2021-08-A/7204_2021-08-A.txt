Footnotes
BASEBALL POLITICS dueled for the lead on the inside while racing up the chute, pulled clear in the next quarter of a mile, continued to open up while
saving ground around the turn and was in command throughout the stretch, winning easily. MI ENLACE hit the gate leaving it, raced off the pace on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position mildly in the stretch, but was no match for the winner. LORD
BOLSTON raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, saved ground around the turn and was outmatched. JULIO TUTWILER hopped
up slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. CHOCOLATE BUNNY dueled for the lead
on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to chase the leader up what remained of the backstretch, continued to lose ground while
racing in the two path around the turn and tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
O'KEEFFE was sent inside, led near the nine sixteenths, set the pace in the two path on the turn, kicked away into the lane, maintained a stalwart
advantage through midstretch while being shown the crop, and drifted out late. SHE CAN'T SING tracked the leading pair early, saved ground in the pocket
behind the leader around the turn, could not reel in O'KEEFFE when driven in upper stretch, but kept on well for the place inside of GRAY OWL. The latter
broke sharply but was outsprinted by O'KEEFFE from the nine sixteenths, stalked the leader three wide around the bend, loomed near the quarter pole,
could not match her kick into the lane, and was outfinished between horses for place. AIKEN TO BE bobbled in the opening strides, raced at the rear in the
opening furlong, improved to the chasing flight into the turn, chased near the rear two wide around the bend, swung out four wide into the lane for the drive,
rallied mildly but missed the show. POSEIDON'S PASSION raced midpack early, was relegated to last into the turn, raced keenly while saving ground
around the bend, swung out five wide for the drive in upper stretch, but lacked the needed kick.

PLEASANT MOON saved ground around the first turn, pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn,
gained ground from the rail in upper stretch, took the lead with a furlong to go and pulled clear late. KEARNY COUNTY saved ground around the first turn,
raced well off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground while drifting out in
late stretch. CADET CAPTAIN led the field from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way on the outside up the backstretch and around
the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and weakened late. DRIVER DAN hopped up leaving the gate, chased the frontrunners from the two path around the
first turn and up the backstretch, offered a mild bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole, and faded in the stretch. SATURDAYS HANGOVER
trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground throughout and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, swung out into the lane in the five path, went to a drive in
upper stretch, responded with a rally, led at the sixteenth and edged clear. KENNESAW was hustled for speed, attended outside of PRINCESS STELLA
early, dueled two wide around the turn, continued to attend as PRINCESS STELLA carried a narrow lead into upper stretch, headed that foe at the furlong
mark, was caught by CITY DRIFTER with a sixteenth of a mile remaining but kept on well enough to hold a share of the place. ETCHED IN STONE settled
in second last early, improved position while saving ground around the turn, swung out three wide into the lane and chased the leading trio in upper stretch,
shifted further out midstretch, found his best in the final sixteenth and got up on even terms with KENNESAW for place in the final jump. RICHY soon trailed,
raced in the two path on the turn, was driven inside foes into the lane, and improved position mildly past tiring horses. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) set the
pace while hounded by KENNESAW early, dueled inside that foe around the turn, wrested a narrow lead in upper stretch, but was caught for good by
KENNESAW at the furlong mark and weakened. KNICKS FRONT chased midfield down the backstretch and in the three to four path on the turn, was driven
into the lane in the four path, and came up empty.

Footnotes
PISTOL BOX saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, began to improve position from the two path around
the far turn and gained ground steadily while drifting out mildly down the lane to win going away. EMPTY HOLSTER led the field from the two path around
the first turn and up the backstretch, opened up while saving ground around the far turn, was clear with a furlong to go, and was caught late, giving way in
the final sixteenth of a mile. MAJESTIC DAY raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed far behind the field up the backstretch, came around the far
turn in the two path, gained ground between horses in upper stretch, swung out to find racing room and continued to improve position on the outside from
there. TALIS PARK GRAD raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the two
path nearing the three eighths pole and was outkicked in the final furlong. CALL THE COLONEL saved ground around the first turn, stalked the leaders on
the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and weakened in the stretch. EDISON FIRE raced in the three path around the
first turn, continued up the backstretch on the outside, angled in to save ground around the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CHRISTIAN C tracked the leading pair inside through the clubhouse turn, inched close to that pair in tandem with TAP THE MOJO down the backstretch,
saved ground in the pocket behind the leading line around the far turn, shifted three wide into the lane, rallied, took the lead with a furlong to go and held
sway. CLEAR N CONVINCING settled toward the rear inside, took closer order while saving ground through the far turn and into the lane, shifted out in front
of MEMORY BANK near the three sixteenths, continued to improve position while drifting out in the lane and carrying that same foe out as he drifted, could
not get to the winner but narrowly outfinished MEMORY BANK for the place. MEMORY BANK raced between horses in the rear flight around the clubhouse
turn, continued between horses near the rear down the backstretch, improved position between horses around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane,
began to rally approaching the three sixteenths, steadied slightly and altered out after CLEAR N CONVINCING shifted out in front of him, rallied despite
continuing to be carried out by that same foe, kept on willingly but was narrowly held off for place. BOURBON TAN hounded the leader two wide into the
clubhouse turn, continued to prompt the pace all the way to the furlong mark, proved no match for CHRISTIAN C as he passed, and flattened out two wide
in the final furlong. FLEETWAY set the pace inside while pressured by BOURBON TAN, had no answer when CHRISTIAN C got past at the furlong mark,
and weakened inside. HANNITY settled at the inside of the rear flight through the clubhouse turn, was relegated to the rear into the backstretch, took closer
order inside into the far turn, was taken out approaching the quarter pole, was driven three wide into the lane, steadied behind a tiring horse approaching the
three sixteenths and altered out further to get around him, and improved mildly between horses in the final furlong. TALE OF THE NILE chased inside HALF
OF MANHATTAN into the clubhouse turn, chased well off the inside midpack down the backstretch, was hung four wide into the far turn and took closer
order when pushed along, fanned six wide into the lane and flattened. HALF OF MANHATTAN settled two wide toward the rear through the clubhouse turn,
continued toward the rear outside down the backstretch, was pushed along while positioned four wide on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally in the
lane. TAP THE MOJO tracked the leading pair outside of CHRISTIAN C through the clubhouse turn, took closer order in tandem outside of that foe down
the backstretch, bid three wide on the far turn, loomed near the quarter, but came up empty when driven four wide into the lane and weakened between
horses. RIVER EVANGELIST was slow into stride, settled two wide in the rear flight early, raced three wide in the rear flight around the clubhouse turn,
continued outside near the rear down the backstretch, trailed in the five path on the far turn, and offered no rally. THE STEWARDS MADE AN INQUIRY
INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN ADDITION, THE RIDER OF MEMORY BANK CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CLEAR N CONVINCING,
ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
RAYO DE LUZ led the field from the two path around the first turn, continued to show the way while racing inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off down the lane. SLIABH AUGHTY (FR) saved ground around the first turn, stalked the
leaders on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, and chased the winner home, no match for that
rival but the best of the rest. BULLDOG OF BERGEN chased the leaders from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around
the far turn still in the two path and was outkicked in the stretch while finishing evenly. ONE WAY HOME pressed the pace from the three path around the
first turn, raced between horses up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn, and continued to tire from there.

Footnotes
KHOSEA raced keenly inside early, was taken back to track the pace inside of GIRLS COUNT into the clubhouse turn, continued to track in the pocket
behind the leading line down the backstretch and into the far turn, popped two wide approaching the five sixteenths to bid outside the pacesetter, took the
lead two wide near the quarter, drove clear in upper stretch and maintained her advantage under hand urging late. ALOTMOREACTION chased midpack
around the clubhouse turn, continued midfield inside of SUPREME IRENE down the backstretch, took closer order in tandem with that foe past the five
eighths, chased while saving ground around the far turn, began to improve approaching the quarter, rallied into the lane two wide between horses, proved
no match for KHOSEA from upper stretch but kept on well to prove second best. LOCASH settled near the rear outside of BIRD KEY early, came into the
backstretch between horses in the rear flight, inched slightly closer in tandem with ONE FLASHY GIRL past the five eighths, continued patiently toward the
rear in the two path on the far turn, raced three wide behind a line of horses into the lane, rallied between horses, and got up in time for the show.
SUPREME IRENE chased behind the tracking flight through the clubhouse turn, chased well off the leading foursome into the backstretch, took closer order
past the five eighths in tandem with ALOTMOREACTION, chased in the three path on the far turn, improved three wide between horses into the lane, was
outkicked by ALOTMOREACTION from upper stretch, continued to chase willingly but lost the show late. ONE FLASHY GIRL veered out slightly at the
break, settled at the rear early, raced three wide in the rear flight down the backstretch, inched up to take closer order along with LOCASH past the five
eighths, continued near the rear four to five wide around the far turn, fanned six wide into the lane, rallied mildly in upper stretch but was outfinished in the
final furlong. BIRD KEY settled near the rear inside of LOCASH on the clubhouse turn, continued at the inside of the rear flight into the backstretch, was
relegated to a lone last past the five eighths, trailed in the four path on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, shifted out toward the center of the track in
upper stretch, and passed tiring horses. GIRLS COUNT tracked the leader between horses around the first turn, pulled into the backstretch to prompt
outside of VALERIE VALESKI, attended the pace three wide around the far turn, floated four wide into the lane and came up flat. COUGER tracked the
leader three wide through the clubhouse turn, was keen three wide to attend the pace into the backstretch, continued in close range four wide through the
far turn, and emptied out five wide into the lane. VALERIE VALESKI set the pace inside while racing keenly early, took some pressure down the
backstretch, cleared briefly again past the three eighths while saving ground on the far turn, was headed approaching the quarter pole and weakened.
