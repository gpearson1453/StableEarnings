Footnotes
HAPPY FORTY EIGHT brushed the outer rival at the start, settled in behind the leaders, asked for a bit at the seven-sixteenths, went three then four wide
on the turn while being put to a drive nearing the quarter pole, got up in the final sixteenth to edge clear late. EL CHUMELITO stalked the pace from outside
going three wide on the turn, took a narrow lead turning for home, was outfinished. BAYERN TO BE WILD exchanged some contact at the start with the
inside rival, angled inside that one clearing the gap, saved ground on the turn then came out turning for home before angling back inside at the furlong
marker, ran on evenly. E BAR GOLD exchanged a bump at the start, dictated terms from just off the rail, weakened. BORTSTEIN was lightly brushed at the
break, raced toward the back off the inside in the four to five path and was never a threat.

Footnotes
CANOODLING settled off the leaders while wide, angled to the two path at the seven-sixteenths, came out four wide past the quarter pole, bid between
rivals leaving the turn, lugged in a bit just path the furlong marker, edged clear given just one solid pump from the rider mid-stretch and was geared down
late. ZAMARA shifted in early, came out and bumped a rival at the seven-sixteenths, angled to the rail abruptly past the three-eighths entering the turn, bid
inside leaving that bend, was no match for the winner but just held the place. FLYIN FALYNN stalked the leaders from outside, was bumped lightly about
the seven-sixteenths, went four to five wide on the turn, missed second. LITTLE SAMURAI dueled inside a rival but in the two path into the turn, was
between foes on that bend, weakened in the stretch. IZE A CRAFTY GAL dueled outside a rival, went three wide and between foes on the turn, gave way.
AFFAIRS UNLIMITED switched well off the inside heading up the backstretch, moved back in going in the two to three path on the turn, swung out for upper
stretch but had no rally. INVODKAWETRUST failed to threaten racing in the two path on the turn.

FLIGHT SONG settled off the leaders, went outside foes five wide on the turn, drew even near the sixteenth pole and edged past late. COUNT THEM
AGAIN bobbled ever so slightly at the break but recovered to move forward and press the pace from outside, went three wide on the turn. LET IT ROLL
tracked the leaders traveling in the two path on the turn, angled out five wide leaving that bend and coming into upper stretch past the furlong marker, began
to edge closer then shied and had to check as a rival drifted into her path about the sixteenth pole. LEMON DROP GOLD set the early tempo from off the
inside, faced pressure up the backstretch and on the turn going on or just off the rail, weakened. MOVIN ON was asked for run early but lacking speed, went
three to four wide on the turn and ran on. TUTTA TERLINGUA stalked mid-pack outside, went four wide on the turn and continued evenly. QUESTA trailed
early, went three to four wide on the turn, swung six wide into the lane and gained belatedly. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS
OBJECTIONS FROM BOTH THE TRAINER AND RIDER OF LET IT ROLL AGAINST COUNT THEM AGAIN ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND THE FORMER.

AWESOME STORM stalked off the pacesetter outside, entered the turn four wide moving in a path to track in behind the leader before coming back outside
that one later on the bend, took the lead at the head of the stretch, drifted out under left-handed urging and brushed a rival in late stretch but held.
IZERIGHT settled mid-pack, moved out two to four wide on the turn, launched a bid from between runners in upper stretch, was brushed lightly in late
stretch but which did not stop the rider or horse from continuing to exert effort until about one stride from the finish line when the rider stood up and waved
his arm high in the air. CHEESE TRAY raced just off the leaders early, began to advance four then five wide on the turn coming about six or seven deep into
upper stretch, kept on well. MY STORM WARRIOR was just off the leader, shifted in and made up ground from the two path leaving the turn but evened out
in the drive. DELBERT TOO was unhurried inside early, came out three wide about midway on the turn, gained late. ILIKEROLLIN was in the back half of
the field off the pace and outside early, went five to six wide on the turn and ran evenly. SARGE broke in just a bit and was briefly taken hold of, switched
out heading up the backstretch racing wide, came back in to go three to four deep on the turn and went evenly. AISLE RUNNER shifted in, saved ground on
the turn and failed to rally. CHAMP SPIRIT set the pace from off the inside going in the three path on the turn, faltered and faded. DIGGER'S GOLD trailed
racing off the rail and failed to menace. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF IZERIGHT AGAINST
AWESOME STORM ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND BEHIND THE FORMER.

Footnotes
TRUEZER came in a bit after the break, contested the pace from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, edged clear into the stretch and held well.
REAL PENNY switched out to stalk the leaders three to four wide through the turn, could make no headway but was second best. RIGGED TO RUN vied
inside the winner on or just off the rail, weakened. DIRT BIKE SLADE was off slowly then bumped and steadied at the break, went two to three wide on the
turn and improved position. JASMINE WHO was off the pace early, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to rally. WILEO PROCEED tracked the early
pace inside then came up empty. OKIE CITY veered in bumping a rival and steadying at the start, went in the four to five path on the turn and was unable to
menace.
