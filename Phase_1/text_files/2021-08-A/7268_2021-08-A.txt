Footnotes
NOT AFRAID opened up inside early, was challenged from the outside by GS POPPY'S WARRIOR into the first turn and carried that rival out, maintained a
short lead outside down the backstretch and through the final turn, dueled stretch, edged away late. GS POPPY'S WARRIOR, carried out first turn, dropped
back and moved inside, forced pace down the backstretch to late final turn, dueled stretch, gave grudgingly. HENRISINCONTROL stalked forced pace off
rail, couldn't gain. TONY THE TAGGER stalked inside, moved outside late final turn, lacked rally. PRIVATE EDISON stalked off rail, lacked rally. MYTRUED
showed little. CHIPPEWA KID stalked outside, dropped back final turn, eased stretch. The rider aboard GS POPPY'S WARRIOR lodged a claim of foul
against NOT AFRAID for interference on the first turn. NOT AFRAID was disqualified from first and placed second.
