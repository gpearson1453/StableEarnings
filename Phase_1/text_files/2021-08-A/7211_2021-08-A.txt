Footnotes
LINDALOUIMAGE shared the lead in hand between horses, was roused on the second bend, took the rail into the lane, moved clear under a drive and
maintained control under steady handling. DIAMOND STELLAR broke on top, vied for the lead from inside, did not keep up after a half mile, lodged her bid
along the rail the last eighth and took over second nearing the final sixteenth. DANCIN AT MIDNIGHT progressed from paths two then three to contest the
pace outside LINDALOUIMAGE on the backstretch, was no match for that one when set down for the drive and began to slowly wear down the last furlong.
SHE'S A BIG STAR prominent from outside, flattened out widest the final quarter mile.

SMOAKEM from outside, did not keep up on the turn, was three wide entering the stretch, angled out when VIRGA took his path inside the last eighth,
closed well but was too late. CITY POSITION well placed inside from the beginning, slowly retreated along the rail on the turn and upper stretch, altered out

Footnotes
WAR TRAIL shared the early lead between horses, moved ahead two wide on the turn, was challenged from outside at the top of the lane, brushed
repeatedly as he fought to hold on and kept BONNIE DANCES at bay. BONNIE DANCES was boxed in behind the early leaders, got through three wide
nearing the quarter pole, engaged WAR TRAIL at the head of the stretch, lugged in several times under right-handed pressure, brushing repeatedly with the
latter as he battled on even terms and did not have enough left in the waning yards. CELIA'S DANCE fractious in the paddock, was composed during the
post parade, made a slight leap from the gate when the race began, progressed from inside on the bend, swung out three wide for the stretch run, gained
third, lacked the extra needed in the late going but lasted for the show. STRATUS STORM chased from inside, angled out through the turn, had a striking
position four wide midstretch but leveled off instead. HE'S A FINE MAN was hustled to the lead from inside, did not stay with WAR TRAIL on the bend,
began to drift out leaving the turn, was checked in traffic and gradually angled out as he faded through the lane. HAYGRINDER urged along from outside on
the backstretch, gave way widest on the turn.

GIRLOLAMO'GLORY rated outside MARCO'S DREAM, was roused leaving the bend, under a drive in the lane, took the lead with seventy yards left and
began to drew off. ABSTRACT PAYNTER chased from inside, angled out on the turn, was widest into the lane, drifted out under right-handed pressure,
lugged in when switched to left-hand urging but closed the gap late and caught MARCO'S DREAM for second near the wire. MARCO'S DREAM was quickly
clear, showed the way just off the inside, was under mostly hand urging in the lane and did not have enough left deep stretch. COOL AMBITION soon
trailed, saved ground taking the bend and found best stride too late the final eighth.

EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE was sent to keep the inside as she vied for the lead from the start, rated through the first bend, roused leaving the second turn,
steadily opened up under a drive in the lane and kept to task to the wire. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE contested the pace outside EKATIMORNINGSTRIKE for
nearly six furlongs, was no match for that one when set down for the drive, began to wear down inside the last furlong but kept GOLDEN LILY at bay for the
place under steady handling. GOLDEN LILY rated from outside, commenced her bid after a half mile, came into contention from path three on the second
bend, drifted out some upper stretch, kept a straight path the last eighth and was closing in for second late. SIMPLY FAST failed to menace in a
ground-saving trip.

W W SCOUT'S HONOR vied for the early lead briefly from inside, angled outside UNCLE EARL nearing the end of the first quarter mile, was let out from
between horses on the bend, took over the lead, asked leaving the turn, drew clear upper stretch and maintained full control while kept to task until nearing
the wire. BABA LOU forwardly placed between rivals from the beginning, waited for room just off the inside on the turn, gained a clear path four wide at the
top of the stretch, gained second with a furlong to go, could not close the gap on W W SCOUT'S HONOR but pulled away for the place. SIRCORRI chased
from inside, angled out on the turn, lodged a mild bid five wide to reach contention midstretch but could only gain third in the late going. MYSTERY MAN
rated toward the outside on the backstretch, was let out to loom a serious threat outside W W SCOUT'S HONOR with two furlongs to go but flattened out for
the drive. UNCLE EARL soon had a narrow lead, moved clear and took the inside midway down the backstretch then began to wear down before finishing a
half mile. FIXICO soon trailed, raced widest of all and was not a factor.
