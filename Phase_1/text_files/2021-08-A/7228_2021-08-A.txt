Footnotes
IRON ROB was away in good order to press the pace of DUDLEY STUDLEY while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, quickly opened a clear lead and drew off through the lane as the handiest of winners. DUDLEY STUDLEY broke sharply to set a
pressured pace, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well to hold the place. JUNGLE BOY raced unhurried early, moved five-wide through
the turn and finished with some late run. FUZZY DOLPHIN was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing
response. SOVEREIGN NATION settled off the leaders throughout and failed to rally.

Footnotes
THUNDER MUSIC broke in, set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run and drew off. DANNY ZUKO
pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, could not match strides with that rival in the closing yards but held on to save the place. FIRING PIN
was bumped at the start then reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. CHARLIE THE
GENT was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and failed to rally. BAT MAN'S BULL showed brief speed, raced
four-wide through the turn and weakened.

KORON broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held sway to the wire. AKASI disputed the
pace from the inside, dropped back nearing the three-eighths marker, angled out with a furlong to run and rallied late. PONTIFFANY vied for the lead from
between foes, stayed on well in the drive and gave way through the final furlong. SAILING IN lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did
not threaten. MIMAJOON broke awkwardly, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
QUEEN BREEZY was away in good order to press the pace of COWLITZ while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off as a
handy winner. STAND IN YOUR LOVE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and was up for the place. MISS MONIQUE was
reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain in the drive. IN THE WIND lagged early,
saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and passed tiring foes late. COWLITZ broke sharply to set a pressured pace
from the inside and weakened after going a half. SHARMEL settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
TIPPYTAP ON SAND pressed the pace of FINISHED MY PHD from the inside, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and drew off. FINISHED
MY P H D was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, could not match strides through the final furlong but held on well to save
the place. THAT'S MY STORY settled off the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out with a furlong to run and failed to
gain late. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. ALWAYS FOR MONEY
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not menace. SLEEPY SUE was off slow, lagged, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer
a bid. ZEYNEP was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
LOLO PANIOLO tracked the pace of WINER AT NINE from the inside, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out in mid-stretch and wore that
rival down to be going away late. WINE AT NINE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from off the rail and yielded to the winner through the final
sixteenth. THE PRESS lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further approaching the stretch and was up for the show. WILSON
TO LOCKETT showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with a belated bid. MIXO was forwardly
placed early, moved four-wide through the turn, remained in contention through mid-stretch and gave way. SWAMP SOUFFLE was off slow, raced
unhurried early and did not reach contention. GRINDER SPARKSAGLO broke sharply to chase the pace of WINE AT NINE and weakened after going a
half.

Footnotes
DON'T RUB IT broke awkwardly, rushed to vie, dueled for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths pole, responded
when challenged by LOVE ON FLY in mid-stretch and drew clear in the closing yards. PULPIT LINE was off a step slow, lagged early, angled out into the
stretch and finished with good late energy. LOVE ON THE FLY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached
the fore with a furlong to run and gave way in the drive. BETHEL RIDGE chased the leaders from the inside, moved three-wide through the second turn,
angled out into the stretch and failed to gain late. UNCOMMONBLESSING disputed the pace while racing three-wide for a half and gave way. DISCREET
DEMONS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. CASTIELA BLAZE raced four-wide through the first turn,
lacked early speed and was eased through the lane.
