SPILLED PERFUME settled well, advanced while three wide on the turn and finished well to gather SPITFIRE SUZIE in. The latter grabbed the lead, held
well into the stretch and was worn down late. MAGIC IN A HAT chased the pacesetter, lacked room fron the three-sixteenths pole to sixteenth pole and
came up empty. MARILYN'S MAGIC forwardly placed, was urged on the turn and had no rally. ISA'S NIGHT FLIGHT swerved in at the start and did not
factor.

GIROLAMO LUCY saved ground, remained inside for the stretch run and rallied under solid handling. ADD IT ALL UP grabbed the lead, held well into the
stretch and was worn down late. JUSTIN'S GIRL chased along the inside, was angled three wide into the stretch, kept on but lacked the needed bid.
PICTURE LADY stalked the pace and weakened in the late going. DELIGHT SURPRISE broke outwardly and was never involved. TRIBUTE TO TOM was
bumped in the vicinity of the seven-eighths pole and never menaced.

Footnotes
FIRST EMPRESS forwardly placed, advanced on the far turn and rallied while three wide in the stretch. CLAY'S MOON STONE saved ground, remained
inside for the stretch run and finished well. RUSSIAN ROULETTE leaned out at the start, recovered to establish a clear lead, held well into the stretch and
was reeled in late. MATT'S HONEY passed tired ones. HUSH Y'ALL failed to threaten. UNHERDOF stalked the pace and weakened.

Footnotes
SING LOUD chased the pace, advanced on the turn and rallied strongly in the stretch. LANCELOT N ELAINE sprinted clear, held well into the stretch and
proved no match late. FLAT OUT FREED reserved early, commenced a bid on the turn and stayed on in the stretch. MALIBU BAY BREEZE was sluggish at
the start and managed a belated rally. HALO JAX was always outrun. WILLHEBMYSUGADADDY raced forwardly along the inside and faded. KIDO'S
SLING SHOT showed little interest.
