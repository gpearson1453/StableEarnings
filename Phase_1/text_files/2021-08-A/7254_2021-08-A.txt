ECOLOGIST prompted the pace by QUICK AND SILVER, closed ground on that foe nearing the top of the stretch, put away QUICK AND SILVER leaving
the furlong marker and drew clear in the end. QUICK AND SILVER broke alertly and set quick fractions while being pressured by the winner, was confronted
and passed entering the stretch and was outfinished while holding for second. HOT SEAN chased the early pace, saved ground on the turn then swung out
to the three path nearing the top of the stretch but weakened in the stretch run. PASSIONATE REWARD chased the field from the rear, took up at the
three-eighths marker while in tight quarters, was four wide on the turn and tired in the stretch run.

and weakened in the end. AUTISM BLUE chased the leaders while saving ground on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. SHORTMAN had no speed in
the early going, saved ground on the turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch but was not affecting the leaders. HIJO GALANTE tracked the pace from
