QUALITY STONES away best, set the pace while pressed early, took charge along the two path on the bend, opened up some and then was ridden out.
SPARTINA SPLASH in hand four wide early, gained four wide on the turn, responded when asked and finished well to earn the place. RISKY ANALYSIS
forced the issue early, tracked along the three path into the lane and then missed the place. SHE'S NOT BLUFFING checked along the rail at the
five-eighths pole appearing to be in tight, angled out to three path after that, trailed on that path on the turn and then angled wide while failing to menace.
MA MEATLOAF broke in the air spotting the field two lengths, saved ground and weakened inside.
