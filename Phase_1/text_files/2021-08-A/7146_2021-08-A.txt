Footnotes
EAGLE KEEPER set the pace from the inside drew clear after a quarter and drew off under a drive. DRINK MORE BOURBON stalked the pace from the
inside and improved position late. CONFUSION pressed the pace from the two path and faded. JACK LUVS NOVA was allowed to settle then made a three
wide late rally to be up for the show. VIOLET'S BROTHER was off slow and trailed. PURRS WELL was unhurried early then steadily advanced to make a
three wide bid on the turn to be second best. DARN THAT HARRY tracked the leaders from the two path but lacked the late response. GOLDEN GALLANT
chased the leaders from the three path and failed to menace.
