Footnotes
BELLOWS tracked evenly through the backside mounting a bit between horses on the far turn vying four deep down the lane getting up on the wire. BEING
THERE saved ground cutting the corner to bid in upper stretch rallying to a late lead on the rail being grabbed at the wire. EASTPORT pressed clear on the
backside holding daylight to upper stretch digging in late between horses battling to the wire. APPRAISED led early then ceded on the backside stalking
through the far turn extending in the three path down the lane coming up a bit short. SUPER ECHELON was caught five wide bidding on the far turn paying
the price in upper stretch. RY'S REVENGE failed to mount a credible bid. TICKET TO ALASKA stalked the pace chasing on the far turn wilting in upper
stretch.
