Footnotes
MAC PANDOWDY broke inward and almost a length before the others, showed the way from inside, was challenged on the turn, responded to hand urging
to move clear upper stretch, was put to a drive inside the final furlong and held sway. AWESOME SKIPPY forwardly placed from outside, was in path three
through the bend, floated out slightly upper stretch, rallied inside the last eighth, took over second with seventy yards left and was closing in on MAC
PANDOWDY in the waning yards. LAGRUE altered in some at the start trying to keep a clear path, advanced two wide to vie for the lead on the bend, could
not stay with MAC PANDOWDY when set down for the drive and began to wear down the last sixteenth. BULL ATTACK faded from between foes before
finishing two furlongs and responded rather greenly to urging through the lane.

Footnotes
CESSO broke in stride and was quickly clear, showed the way in hand to midstretch then lengthened command under urging. AROSE FOR LYLA forwardly
placed outside CESSO, was roused leaving the bend, under a drive through the lane, was no match for the winner but proved easily second best. CREAL
DREAMER boxed in behind CESSO on the backstretch, did not keep up from just off the inside on the turn, fanned outside AROSE FOR LYLA for the
stretch run and steadily pulled away for third. CHRISTY ATTACK was a factor between rivals on the backstretch, altered to the rail for a clear path on the
bend and had little to offer for the drive. ZIP ATTACK chased from outside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
MEXIA settled at the back, was let out some after a half mile, progressed just off the inside, was put to a drive with two furlongs to go, swung widest into the
stretch, rallied to gain a narrow advantage nearing the final sixteenth, lugged in some late but held on. THE MORE I BURN rated off the early speed, went
for the lead two wide on the second turn, took the lead entering the lane, moved clear, drifted out under left-handed pressure inside the last furlong, lost the
advantage soon after, never relented as she also lugged in some through the waning yards but had to settle for second. UNIVERSIADE gradually
progressed from outside to reach contention from path three on the second bend, fanned out further into the stretch, vied for second with a furlong left, lost
her path approaching the final sixteenth, altered out, closed well, was too late but clearly best of the rest. GRAMMAR settled inside, picked up her pace after
a half mile, saved ground taking the second turn, angled out three wide for a clear path at the top of the lane, had a striking position between rivals
midstretch, lugged in some with a sixteenth to go and leveled off. NEXT TIME YOU WIN moved to the rail midway on the backstretch, threatened with a
quarter mile to go but also lacked the extra kick deep stretch. MARLEE was encouraged to gain a clear early lead, was challenged from outside on the
second bend, lost the advantage as she came into the stretch from just off the inside, slowly yielded from between rivals and angled out inside the final
sixteenth after losing her path.

CARSON RESERVE crowded briefly at the break, was settled outside, closed the gap when let out three wide on the bend, came widest into the stretch,
rallied when put to a drive, took over inside the last eighth then drew off under urging. QUEEN'S MISSION broke alertly, was soon challenged from inside,
moved clear two wide when allowed on the turn, was under urging in the lane, no match for CARSON RESERVE, began to wear down deep stretch but
lasted for the place. SENORITA AURORA soon trailed, had the rail on the bend, came off the inside some for the stretch run, showed a willingness to run
the final furlong, could only make up minor ground on the leader but caught PECOS AUTUMN for third. PECOS AUTUMN in contention early, was just off
the inside on the bend, took the rail for a clear path at the top of the lane, moved clear for third, leveled off inside the last eighth, altered out for room in the
waning yards and was outfinished for the show. ASIA ASIA advanced inside QUEEN'S MISSION to vie for the early lead, did not stay with that one on the
turn and gave way the final two furlongs.

Footnotes
ALMAFUERTE was kept close, went for the lead three wide on the bend, battled in the lane, edged ahead inside the last eighth and kept GHAALEB'S
SICILIAN at bay under steady handling. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN forwardly placed from outside, lost ground four wide through the turn, had every chance with
a furlong left, could not close the gap on ALMAFUERTE but caught MORA VALLEY for second nearing the wire. MORA VALLEY contested the early pace
outside LONG LEGGED LINDA, was two wide taking the bend, fought through the lane, slowly yielded the final furlong but was easily best of the others.
AMERICAN HOLIDAY reared up at the break, advanced off the inside, took the rail on the turn, had a striking position with a quarter mile to go but gave way
for the drive. LONG LEGGED LINDA displayed early speed from inside but began to fade before finishing four furlongs. CAROL'S A CASE soon trailed and
showed little.

Footnotes
RENEGADE BOB rated from outside, advanced from path three on the bend, was roused leaving the turn, rallied under steady urging in the lane and got up
nearing the wire. KEEP A EYE ON MIKE bumped at the start, showed the way from inside, was put to a drive at the top of the stretch, lengthened
command, was all out the final eighth, could not hold back RENEGADE BOB but was easily second best. ROLL CALL prominent just off the inside,
retreated back to third along the rail on the bend, fanned out some entering the stretch and could only hold his position late. STOSH forwardly placed from
inside on the backstretch, failed to keep up into the turn, angled out some, came three wide into the lane and lacked a significant response. BETTER
ANGELS was a factor just off the inside but faded three wide on the bend. DANCIN NICKY bumped KEEP A EYE ON MIKE at the start, raced in contention
between rivals on the backstretch but gave way widest on the turn.

Footnotes
COUNTRY ASSETS rated from outside on the backstretch, was roused on the bend, angled in be two wide approaching the quarter pole, took the lead
entering the lane, moved clear under urging upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. BOOHOO SUE was away slowly, advanced quickly from inside,
angled out widest on the turn, moved clear for second upper stretch, could not close the gap on COUNTRY ASSETS but was unchallenged for the place.
JUKEBOX MONEY was reluctant to load, bumped with ROCKET QUEEN once the race began, was settled off the inside, moved to rail leaving the bend,
gradually advanced in the lane, altered out for a clear path inside the furlong marker and drew off for third the last sixteenth. ENCHILADA was also away
slowly, moved to the inside with a half mile to go, lost her path leaving the turn, angled out to path three upper stretch and improved position without
threatening. RUBY LEES SONG set the early pace just off the inside, took the rail on the bend, was challenged leaving the turn and gave way through the
lane. ROCKET QUEEN bumped with JUKEBOX MONEY at the break, helped prompt the pace from between rivals but began to fade two wide before
finishing four furlongs.
