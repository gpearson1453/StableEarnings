but was unable to sustain that bid. BE BOP A LOLA raced in the middle of the pack and saved ground on the rail but lacked racing room on the turn and
steadied to be no threat. UPCYCLE trailed.

Footnotes
BULLDOG CONNECTION was unhurried early while advancing from the two path then angled out in the stretch with a late surge to just get up.
JAQUAVIOUS stalked the pace then gained command to edge clear but was caught late in the drive. DANCE SO FRE raced in the middle of the pack from
the three path and steadily advancing then swerved in during the stretch drive to just miss. MAGIC WIZARD was in contention from the three path then
made a bid in the stretch but was no match late. ANGEL'S ENTRY was close up and made a bid outside of JAQUAVIOUS but couldn't match strides and
held well. PASCAL raced near the back and made a late rally to be the best of the rest. NAKED IN CABO chased the leaders throughout and lacked late
response. DOUBLE MAGNUM was allowed to settle while racing two wide but failed to menace. FAUSTO GOLD raced in the middle of the pack from the
inside but was not a factor. STRIKHEDONIA trailed then passed tiring rival. GOLDEN GALLANT set the pace from the two path and tired. FRACTIONAL
AND FINAL TIME NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

drew clear under light urging. ROHRBACHER pressed the pace from the two path and couldn't match strides late in the drive. JACK THE UMPIRE was
hustled to the lead from the inside and set the pace then fought gamely midway through the stretch and flattened out. NILEATOR stalked the pace from the
two path and made a bid on the turn but came up empty. AMERICAN NINJA was squeezed back and trailed early then steadily advanced but faltered in the
drive. ZIPPY tracked the leaders from the inside and gave way in the stretch drive. ANDREZ CONQUIST broke to the outside then was allowed to settle and
saved ground on the inside but was never a factor. DIG CHARLIE DIG was unhurried early and failed to menace. ECLIPSED MOON was well placed off the
leaders in the two path then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
COMMISSIONER G was off slow then steadily advanced from the three path and took command at the five sixteenth pole and drew clear under light urging.
MARACAIBO tracked the leaders from the inside but was no match for the winner. TAPIFLY pressed the pace into the final turn from the two path but
lacked the late response. GALTERO was allowed to settle on the inside the angled out slightly to make a move to improve position. SECOND LINE DAVID
trailed the field early then made a middle move four wide on the turn but faltered in the stretch. DON'T THROW STONES stalked the pace from the two path
and failed to menace. MORE THAN MILES was rushed to the lead and set the pace until the five sixteenth pole then gave way.
