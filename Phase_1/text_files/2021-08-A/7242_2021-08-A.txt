Footnotes
MINISTERSDON'TLIE moved forward under some encouragement to dictate terms in the clear and off the fence, was kept to the task in the lane and held
sway. YES ITSA STAR tracked from inside, dropped back on the turn while saving ground, kept on in the lane to close the gap. ANOTHER BROTHER
chased from between runners early, moved out two then three wide on the turn, ran on evenly. COWBOY TOBY was bumped at the break then exchanged
several light bumps after the break, chased from between rivals initially then outside four to five wide on the turn, weakened in the lane. LAYCOCK BAY
reared at the start then was allowed to settle into stride, saved ground early on the turn before shifting out three deep, gained some late. SIDNEY'S HOPE
bumped the inside foe at the break, chased briefly from outside, dropped back five to six wide on the turn and came up empty. ZOMBIE ALAN exchanged
repeated light bumps after the break, chased from between runners, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and came up empty. WRAPPED was
lacking early speed, went three to five wide on the turn and was never a threat.

RISKY REVENGE tracked the pace from inside, took the lead past the five-sixteenths, drifted out five wide leaving the far turn while well clear into upper
stretch, was headed at the sixteenth pole but fought back to get the nod. ATTILA'S FLAG settled toward the back along the inside, moved out three deep
coming past the quarter pole beginning to advance, swung out seven wide into upper stretch, found another gear at that juncture, moved to the fore a
sixteenth out but appeared to hang nearing the wire. PUB settled outside a runner at the back going two wide on the first turn, moved out up the backstretch
then from three to two wide on the far turn, was within contention at the head of the lane but had no late kick. F S POSITRACK raced outside just off the
leader four then three wide on the first turn, lost ground going four wide on the far turn and could not rally. TRACTOR MAN set the pace off the rail mostly in
the three path, was headed entering the far turn and weakened. MICKEYS GOLD was not a threat racing in the two path on the turns and tired in the lane.
