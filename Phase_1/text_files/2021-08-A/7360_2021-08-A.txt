Footnotes
LAZARETTO hooked up in a dispute for the early lead outside THE GLADIATOR, fought shoulder to shoulder with that rival around the track, and prevailed
after a long drive. THE GLADIATOR (CHI) vied inside LAZARETTO throughout while in the two-path, and yielded grudgingly through deep stretch. NONA
RAC saved ground close up from the start, stayed on the rail through the drive and lacked a solid final response. MASTER Q shifted out four wide
approaching the stretch, had aim outside the leaders through the furlong grounds but could not gain. OVERSTATED was outrun to the stretch in the
two-path, and found his best stride belatedly while staying on his left lead. TEXAS PLAYBOY saved ground outrun early, moved out five wide approaching
the stretch, and made no headway. UNDER FIRE faded steadily three to four wide. JOHNNIE GOT JETS broke slowly and showed little inside.

Footnotes
STAR JUANCHO had early speed inside of AMOR LEJANO, settled off the pace inside around the turn, burst through inside in upper stretch and drew off
while drifting out under right-handed urging. RESERVENOTATTAINED pressed the pace three wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, led to upper
stretch, was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to save the place. LIFE IN SHAMBLES was in tight at the start, stalked the pace two and
three wide between foes, angled five wide in upper stretch, was gaining late and just missed second. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) set the pace in the two path
and tired in the lane. BOLD ENVOY chased the pace four wide and lacked a closing bid. SIR KAHN was off slow and trailed five wide.

Footnotes
TRIKITRAKI vied early inside PURE SPEIGHT, shook clear shifting to the two-path on the turn, and widened through the stretch under a drive. FROSTED
ARMOUR bumped with PURE SPEIGHT at the start, saved ground in range to the stretch, had the rider drop the crop a furlong from home, and finished
willingly to get up for the place. PURE SPEIGHT bumped with FROSTED ARMOUR at the start, pressed TRIKITRAKI from outside to the turn, could not
match strides after three-eighths of a mile, and was outfinished for the place. SOUTHERN BREEZE raced four wide around the turn, lugged in through the
stretch winding up on the rail, and did enough to get the last major share. EYE OF THE TEMPLE was never prominent. THE BEAST was three wide on the
turn, and made no impact through the lane on the far outside. DON JOHNNY B. broke a step slow, advanced mildly around the turn four then five wide, but
could not sustain the rally. CHROME'SRISINGSUN broke slowest, and was outrun inside. CREATIVE MAGIC was outrun three wide. RAYO COLORADO
showed brief speed outside, and gave way before reaching the stretch.

PERFECT SILENT CAT pressed the pace two wide, took over leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. EMPEROR'S CAUSE raced in range
three and four wide, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on outside to gain the place. RABDAN set a pressured pace inside of
the winner to midstretch and weakened. PAPETU steadied leaving the three-quarters pole, raced in range two wide between foes, had the rider drop the
whip in upper stretch and lacked a rally. PALADIO stalked the pace from the rail, bid in upper stretch but weakened through the final furlong. TWELVE
VOLT MAN failed to menace while racing four wide.

Footnotes
R KING KONG sped clear after an alert beginning, showed the way in the two-path around the turn, widened into the lane under pressure and faced no
challenges. TWICE TOO MANY advanced outside the pacesetter on the turn, could not narrow the gap through the lane and was clearly second best. HIGH
YIELD KITTEN raced two wide around the turn, advanced after three-eighths of a mile, but made no further gains staying on his left lead. MUTAKAAMIL
was slow into stride, and passed only tired horses. FROZEN ASSETS hit the left side of the gate and was off two lengths slow, moved out four wide past the
quarter-pole, swerved in to the rail from right-hand pressure in upper stretch, and remained out of contention. FULL SEND was four wide into the turn,
moved in a path and was through after three furlongs. BIG RED STYLE chased after the winner two wide early, and tired through the lane on the rail.
SMILING TEUFLES raced four to five wide around the turn, and tired.

Footnotes
BRODY'S HONOR took closer order after a half-mile, came three wide rallying off the far turn, reached the front from outside with a furlong remaining and
drove clear. LA RUSIA was three wide on the first turn, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, loomed a threat between horses at the top of the stretch, got
outkicked by the winner past the eighth-pole and had enough to save the place. KEITANY bumped with EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH at the start, went along
two wide in the second flight to the far turn, found his best stride leaving the furlong grounds and finished willingly between horses just missing second.
RAISON THE GLASS saved ground to the far turn, moved out in the stretch and rallied mildly. EIGHTY SEVEN NORTH bumped with KEITANY at the start,
lagged well back for six furlongs, moved to the rail through midstretch and made up some ground without threatening. AWESOME ELLA failed to become a
factor three wide. GINGERONMYMIND was outrun inside. SISTER IS DEVIL pressed MISS WROTE from outside early, kicked away from that rival getting
clear into the far turn, then could not hold off challengers in upper stretch and gave way. MISS WROTE set the early pace inside, steadied slightly as
SISTER IS DEVIL sped past her entering the far turn, and had nothing left after six furlongs. DORA PRINCELLA broke slowest, and was outrun throughout
while racing three to four wide.

O CAPTAIN set a clear pace along the rail and drew off readily under a drive. ZIPPIN GIGI was off a step slow, chased the winner two wide, was no match
for that foe but stayed on well to hold second. CHROMED IMPULSE chased the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and was along for
the show. JEST ABOVE steadied when in a bit tight early, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. FEDERAL EXCHANGE failed to menace while
racing four wide. FREDO tracked the pace three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. GRABBING THE MONEY trailed five wide.

HENRY'S WORLD sped clear after the start, set a sharp pace inside to the stretch, and responded well to remain in command. BREAKTHROUGH pursued
the winner outside from the outset, could not make headway through the lane but ran on willingly to best the others. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR alternated
between the rail and two-path outsprinted for three furlongs, and rallied mildly to get up for the show. COWBOY AT HEART raced three wide around the
turn, and had no closing bid. STAR WEAVER checked sharply taking awkward strides on the rail entering the turn, moved out three wide after that and
remained outrun. NITRO TIME broke slowly, and was never involved three wide. MR TINGLES stayed close early inside, steadied along through the first
part of the turn losing ground to the leaders, and continued to fade through the stretch never fully set down.

Footnotes
WELL DEFINED prompted the pace two wide, took over near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, vied outside of TRAVY BOY past the
eighth pole, drove clear near the sixteenth marker, was getting in a bit late and just lasted. SHIVAREE settled off the pace along the inside, angled four wide
near the quarter pole, surged late outside and just missed. PRO QUALITY was very fractious in the gate, broke last, moved into a tracking position down the
backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, stayed on to narrow the gap without seriously threatening in the final sixteenth. TRAVY BOY set the pace
along the rail, was collared by the winner near the quarter pole, fought on inside to sixteenth pole and weakened a bit late. SILVERLY ENOUGH raced off
the pace three and four wide and had a mild belated rally. WITH VERVE failed to menace while racing four wide. UNTITLED chased the pace three wide
and faded through the lane.

Footnotes
MARISA'S MISSION tracked from close range early, bid between horses with a quarter-mile remaining, battled outside BRETT'S WORLD through a long
drive and edged away late. BRETT'S WORLD rated along through easy fractions inside, dug in when challenged approaching the stretch, and yielded
grudgingly. FEELING DANGEROUS settled in the middle of the field to the far turn in the two-path, finished evenly and went clear for the show.
TRACEABILITY raced three to four wide throughout, loomed a threat outside the leaders approaching the stretch, but flattened out. STRAIGHT UP GUY
bumped with HARD TEN through the early going, and posed no threat two wide. HARD TEN bumped with STRAIGHT UP GUY and checked out of tight
quarters between horses first time through the stretch, moved out three wide and made no headway. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX raced close up early inside, and
faded steadily after six furlongs. SUPER EDGAR tired inside after six furlongs, and dropped far back.
