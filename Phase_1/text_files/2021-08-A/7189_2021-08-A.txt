Footnotes
FINNEGAN (IRE) was a bit keen to the lead, settled better once on the front, set a measured pace down the backstretch and while saving ground on the
turn, opened up when pushed into the stretch, went to a mild drive approaching the furlong mark, opened up an insurmountable lead and won wrapped up.
STORMINSIDE broke sharply, stalked the pace set by FINNEGAN down the chute and backstretch and while two wide on the turn, could not match the
pacesetter from upper stretch but held place while kept to the task. BAROQUE chased two wide, was driven past the three eighths while racing out in the
four to five path, floated six wide into the lane, and kept on mildly past tired horses in the lane. LANDOFTHEPHARAOHS settled at the rear of a compact
pack, was driven in the two to three path on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. HINTON chased inside of BAROQUE down
the chute and backstretch, saved ground while tracking the leading pair through the turn, proved no match for the top two after floating into the lane three
wide, and weakened.

Footnotes
MAMA LOU dueled for the lead on the outside, continued to battle gamely from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch, wore down her rival in the
final furlong and pulled clear late. AKA LIONESS dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, grudgingly gave way in the final
sixteenth of a mile, and was the best of the rest. TWELVE RED ROSES raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn from the two
path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground on the outside while drifting in the final furlong and never threatening the top two. ZIP ATTACK
BABY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened entering the stretch. IRINA'S HERO
trailed the field on the outside the entire way around the oval, angled in to save ground around the turn and was never a factor.

SHE'S HOT TODAY broke in and bumped PRESENT OF HERO in the opening strides, settled to chase toward the rear inside of CHAINMAIL, was pushed
along into the turn, advanced inside of WAY TOO SMARTE while racing in the two path through the bend, angled out four wide into the lane, rallied under a
drive, caught PRESENT OF HERO near the furlong mark and cleared. PRESENT OF HERO was bumped by SHE'S HOT TODAY in the opening strides,
soon led, saved ground while still leading through the turn, was engaged by KURINGAI past the three eighths, raced on even terms with that foe
approaching the quarter, shrugged off that challenger in upper stretch, kept on under a drive but was headed near the sixteenth mark. CHAINMAIL chased
near the rear outside of SHE'S HOT TODAY, continued near the rear in the five path on the turn, was driven approaching the quarter pole, raced into the
lane five wide, and kept on mildly past tiring. KURINGAI tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, bid outside the leader
past the three eighths, was briefly on even terms near the quarter, could not match her from near the three sixteenths and flattened. WAY TOO SMARTE
tracked the leading pair outside of KURINGAI, chased the leading pair in the four path on the turn, was outkicked while racing into the lane in the four path,
and continued to flatten out. RACHELGOTSTEPHEN settled at the rear to race down the chute and the backstretch, trailed in the three path on the turn,
was driven into the lane in the five path and mustered no rally.

STAR OF KODIAK tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, engaged outside the pacesetter approaching the quarter,
loomed in upper stretch, took the lead just past the furlong pole, cleared, and held under a drive. MIDNIGHT BLUE NOTE settled near the rear, continued
patiently in the three path on the turn, swung out into the lane in the five path, rallied five wide, gained to the finish but was too late to reel in the leader.
ROYAL COMMISH settled at the rear, raced in the two to three path on the turn, was driven in the three path into the lane, rallied with interest between
horses but was outfinished for the place. OLSON chased the leading pair down the backstretch and while saving ground on the turn, swung three wide into
upper stretch, took closer order but was ultimately outfinished between horses. RED HOT DEVIL sent clear early, set the pace in the two path on the turn,
was engaged to his outside by STAR OF KODIAK approaching the quarter, clung to the lead in upper stretch, was headed just past the furlong mark and
weakened inside.

Footnotes
MAGICIAN STONE stalked the leaders up the backstretch, swung out to race in the three path headed into the turn, began an outside bid nearing the
quarter pole, gained ground steadily down the lane and prevailed while drifting out in the final furlong. YO DAWG was bumped and forced over by the horse
to his inside leaving the gate, raced on the inside in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began an inside rally in late
stretch and gained ground to the wire. ADIOS ASHER was away from the gate quickly, dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back
slightly while saving ground around the turn, switched outside in midstretch and re-rallied to gain ground late. AMERICAN CHAOS brushed with the horse to
his inside leaving the gate, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, took over the lead while running in the two path around the turn, dueled in
upper stretch and gave way between horses in the final furlong. KERNS NOT KEARNS brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the
field through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position on the inside down the lane. BALTIC FLEET raced
off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the three path, and finished evenly. RONSTADT bumped with the horse to his inside
leaving the gate, raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was outkicked late.

Footnotes
THE GREEN MO'STER bounded out to the lead, set the pace while clear, raced in the two path on the far turn, was confronted by CONVICT PIKE to his
outside from near the quarter, kept finding enough to hold on to the lead when driven, and held off the four-wide DANVILLE while racing between horses
late. DANVILLE tracked the leading pair outside of CONVICT PIKE through the clubhouse turn, kept on to track the leading pair down the backstretch, raced
three wide behind the leading pair into the turn, chased them in the three path around that bend, raced four wide in upper stretch, drifted in past the eighth
pole, bumped soundly with TORNADO BOY as that one was drifting out, nonetheless sustained a four wide rally and narrowly missed. TORNADO BOY
chased behind the tracking flight into the clubhouse turn, settled back between horses in the rear flight down the backstretch while not racing far behind the
three horses lined up in front of him, improved between horses into the far turn, dropped in to save ground after HIGH SPIRITS began to flatten near the
three eighths, chased the leading pair in upper stretch, drifted out past the furlong mark and bumped soundly with DANVILLE as that foe drifted in, dropped
to the inside for the final sixteenth, rallied, and was nearest at the finish. CONVICT PIKE tracked the leader while racing inside of DANVILLE through the
clubhouse turn, continued to track the pacesetter down the backstretch and in the three path on the far turn, bid outside of THE GREEN MO'STER
approaching the quarter, loomed to that leader's outside into the stretch, could not reel him in, and flattened out slightly late while three wide between
horses. HIGH SPIRITS settled at the rear inside of CAMPIONI, continued at the inside of the rear flight down the backstretch, made a brief bid inside into
the far turn, began to flatten out from the three eighths and had no further response in the lane. CAMPIONI settled at the rear outside of HIGH SPIRITS
through the clubhouse turn, continued three wide in the rear flight on the backstretch, was relegated to a lone last into the far turn, trailed in the three path
around that bend, and had no response when driven in upper stretch. THE RIDER OF TORNADO BOY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
DANVILLE, ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, angled back in to save ground around the far turn, and gained ground between horses in late stretch.
ZAWADI angled over sharply to save ground around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around
the far turn, swung out entering the stretch to find racing room and passed tiring horses on the outside from there. MAGIC SOLUTION saved ground around
the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and flattened out in the stretch.
SPEAK ENGLISH fought her rider some while chasing the leader from the two path around the first turn, raced between horses up the backstretch,
navigated the far turn in tight quarters in the three path, and weakened in the final furlong. CAVE CREEK led the field from the two path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the far turn and faded in the stretch. UNBURNT hopped up leaving the gate,
