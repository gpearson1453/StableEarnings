the backstretch, launched a bid near the five sixteenths pole, dug in near the inside and held place. JOY IN JERUSALEM rated not too far back in early
stages, picked up the pace around the far turn, hustled up three then two wide in the lane and stayed on for a share. MABEL'S FABLE settled inside,
hustled up two wide into the lane, shifted out wider for the drive and produced a mild bid. MAGIC MELODY was unhurried, saved ground around the far
turn, tipped two wide into the lane and failed to threaten. IMPETUOSITY vied around the first turn then stalked the pacesetter, bid two wide around the far

STREET TAPPER was off a step slow at the start, angled inside and saved ground around the turn, cut the corner then angled out three wide under left
handed pressure, responded gamely and swept by in late stages. SENSON tracked the pacesetter along the rail, tipped out a path and headed in pursuit at
the head of the lane, roused forward and briefly held the lead then got outfinished by the winner. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER raced in range around the turn,
hustled up two wide into the lane, shifted out wider for the drive and sustained a steady bid for a share. ABSTRACT MOMENT raced three wide into the
lane, shifted out wider in the upper stretch and improved position. BABY LUCK raced in contention around the turn, remained a strong contender to
midstretch then flattened out. CHECK THE GRADE led the way by a clear margin, stayed on top into the lane, got collared and faded late. LADY
PROWESS saved ground around the turn and lacked a needed rally. WHEREDIDYOUGO raced off the pace, went four wide into the lane and never
threatened. SUBTLE GIANT raced two wide into the lane and had no response.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC GOLD settled through early stages, picked up the pace four wide nearing the quarter pole, roused forward under pressure, dueled with NICKY
BEAR nearing the wire, dug in gamely and prevailed. NICKY BEAR rated inside through the backstretch, angled out around the far turn, roused forward into
striking distance, dug in gamely when challenged in the deep stretch, dueled in final strides and just missed. SPANISH CZAR set the pace through the
backstretch, held firm around the far turn, stayed on with response past the furlong marker then weakened in deep stretch. BASSETT was unhurried and
saved ground, hustled up two wide into the lane and improved position. PALMETTO BLUE stalked the top two pacesetters through early stages, coaxed
inside around the turn then gave way in the lane. CASTILLETE raced off the pace, saved ground heading into the lane and lacked a needed rally for impact.
SMALL FIELD was forwardly placed through early stages, remained up close around the far turn, failed to keep pace in the lane and steadily weakened.
HARRY HOTSPUR steadied after the start, raced near midpack then had no response when called upon and faded. DUNN DEAL raced off the pace and
saved ground to no avail. MIDNIGHT RIDER hustled up three to four wide around the turn and had no response.
