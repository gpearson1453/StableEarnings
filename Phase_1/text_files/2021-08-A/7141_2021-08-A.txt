LOADED JOE four paths off the inside early on, tucked three then two wide at the seven-sixteenths forcing RIVER REDEMPTION to take to the inside
directly in front of UNCLE MO'S CAT, forcing that foe to steady, tucked to the rail at the three-eighths just in behind the top trio, angled out to spin three
wide into upper stretch and gained a lane as CONGRATS FOR GLORY floated four wide, rallied on through switching leads at the three-sixteenths
advancing to take command a furlong out, then edged away under a drive kept to task. EVERESTING broke out a step at the start brushing RAISING
SAND, showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from a pair, got set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and
was collared a furlong from home, ran on to preserve the place honors on the wire. RIVER REDEMPTION coaxed from the gate, chased three then two
wide, tucked inside when LOADED JOE tucked over from the outside and in turn forced UNCLE MO'S CAT to steady off his heels, tipped back to the two
path into the turn, floated briefly three wide before heading back to the two path placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch,
ran on to secure the show honors. UNCLE MO'S CAT chased just off the inside, had RIVER REDEMPTION tuck directly in front as LOADED JOE tucked in
from the outside and was forced to steady now down along the rail at the seven-sixteenths conceding two lengths in position before settling back into stride,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole, got let out spinning six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just miss for the show honors. NOT
STORMY bumped at the start by ISABELLA'S DREAM, who broke outwards awkwardly and conceded three lengths to the front, chased four then three
wide from near the rear put to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. CAMOUFLAGED KISSER
broke in at the start, pressed the pace two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. THRUSTER chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under a ride from the
five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no headway. RAISING SAND brushed at the start by EVERESTING, who broke outwards, chased just
off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued in the two path into upper stretch and offered no response. CONGRATS FOR GLORY
prompted the pace three wide outside a pair of rivals, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
ISABELLA'S DREAM a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, broke outwards awkwardly at the start bumping NOT STORMY and conceded three lengths
to the front, chased three then two wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under motivation from the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide for home and made no impact. RYE RUNNER coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went three to four
wide at the head of the stretch and was outrun.

Footnotes
BLISSFUL sat back at the start and was off a couple of lengths behind the front, settled on the inside of foes while along the rail, was asked with
five-sixteenths to run then shifted three wide, swung five wide into the stretch then moved a bit further out, rallied outside behind the runner-up into the final
furlong, drifted in while gaining into the final sixteenth, drifted in some more late and got up under strong handling. SILVERY RILL was reserved in the
middle of the field while in the two path under a snug hold, remained in hand early on the far turn, was roused inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide
into the stretch, rallied outside while still on her inside lead, drifted in while gaining into the final furlong, took the lead outside the sixteenth-pole, led to the
final strides but was caught while clear for the place. PAMMY'S READY was taken under a tight hold while going to the front, tugged at the bit while inside
on the first turn, was well rated on an uncontested lead, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, remained clear under a drive into the final furlong
but was overtaken while just able to save the show. DANCIN DEE broke in at the start, was taken in hand early then tucked in before the first turn, saved
ground while rated off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, came under urging on the final turn, was driven into the stretch in the two path,
pursued the leaders in the drive and was out-kicked then just missed the show. GILLIAN ELIZABETH was taken in hand early, rounded the first turn in the
two path, was rated in second position on the outside, came under urging with three furlongs to run, chased in the three path on the far turn, passed the
five-sixteenths under the crop, pursued the leader into the final furlong and weakened. WATERVILLE was off slow and spotted the front a couple lengths,
bumped with BARRETT on the initial straightaway, jostled with that foe in the three path on the opening bend, was reserved under a tight hold then let out
between foes in the two path early on the final turn, moved to four wide while carried out at the five-sixteenths, dropped to three wide into the stretch and
lacked the needed response. BARRETT departed the gate about two lengths behind the front, bumped with WATERVILLE early, jostled with that opponent
while four wide on the first turn, was unhurried at the rear, moved out while briefly off heels around the nine-sixteenths, went three wide early on the far turn
then was carried five wide before dropping back inside the five-sixteenths, moved to the four path at the quarter-pole then moved and failed to respond.

FULL COURT PRESS broke out a step at the start bumping MAGETAP, raced briefly inside before tipping to the three path as the rest of the field vied
heads apart early directly in front, went three then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper
stretch, came in slightly straightened away for home and nudged EUCHARIST before switching to the proper lead, rallied to take command nearing the
eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish kept to task. MEGATAP bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe, who broke out a step, came under
hustling and vied two to three wide between foes among a quintet before easing off to chase two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper stretch and came again to procure the place honors in the final jumps. FROSTED INDIAN vied four paths off
the inside among a quintet emerging with a narrow lead and tucked to the two path into the turn now engaged by a pair to the outside and one rival down
inside in striking range, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths and took the inside route into upper stretch before straightening away for home in
the two path, dug in and was collared near the eighth pole, weakened in the very late stages and was along for the show honors. EUCHARIST veered out at
the start and was corrected under coaxing to vie outside a quartet six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn outside a
pair, swung four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive and was nudged by FULL COURT PRESS straightened away, dug in prominent to the eighth
pole before weakening in the late stages. DEE BO vied from the five path between foes down the backstretch among a quintet and then three wide through
the turn flanked by a pair, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened. LOOKIN FOR LOKI hustled from the gate,
showed the way early on before being confronted by a quartet, vied inside those rivals down the backstretch and was shaken off into the turn to chase in
close range along a tight seam down along the fence, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch in behind the leader and
tired.

Footnotes
JILL'S A HOT MESS broke in and bumped with a foe, pressed the pace on the outside of two rivals, vied in the three path on the turn, took the lead in the
four path into upper stretch, shook clear under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was put to a right-handed crop approaching the sixteenth-pole,
swapped back to her inside lead late and held under strong urging. LILLY SIMONE was coaxed along towards the rear of the field, saved ground early on
the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend then was roused near the quarter-pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive, rallied into the final furlong and
closed fast to just miss while clear for the place. TRANSLATE broke in at the start, tracked the leading trio on the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn,
was roused outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong and was out-kicked while just able to
get the show. JADES GELLY acted-up in the gate and was in the hands of the assistant starter a bit longer then the rest of the field and came out a few
lengths behind the front, was urged along at the rear, went three wide on the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch and finished with good energy to just
miss third. BIG AL'S GAL bumped with an opponent at the start, moved in while settling off the pace, shifted out leaving the backstretch, went three wide on
the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong, remained on her inside lead until just outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the
proper lead at that point and lacked the needed kick in the end. SMOOTH PEBBLE showed good speed, disputed the pace down the backstretch, vied in
the two path on the turn, was asked while spinning into the three path at the quarter-pole then came under a drive while losing the advantage to the winner,
dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. SKY KITTEN broke out and brushed the gate at the start, settled on the outside, passed the half-mile
pole under extra left-rein pressure, moved in leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally. SISTER'S GHOST showed
early speed, contested the pace on the inside, dropped back passing the five-sixteenths and capitulated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START, JADES GELLY WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER DUE TO HER BEING HELD BY THE ASSISTANT STARTER A BIT LONGER THEN THE
REST OF THE FIELD AS SHE ACTED-UP AT THE START

Footnotes
ROTKNEE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside shaking away to a commanding lead midway on the turn, spun just off the
inside for home, saw his margin cut into while holding well to the finish kept busy to the end. TIN PAN ALLEY brushed at the start by BOINTHEBACK, who
recovered outwards from a stumble, chased five then four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn steadily
advancing through the bend, swung four wide for home, dug in under a drive and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. WHITTINGTON PARK
brushed the near side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and grew erratic when tipped to the two path floating back and forth
between the three and two path before settling two to three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home,
shied out two paths under a near side crop strike at the three-sixteenths, ran on to secure the show honors clear of the rest. BOINTHEBACK stumbled at
the start recovering outwards into TIN PAN ALLEY, chased three to four paths down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, went
five wide for home and improved position to the finish. KENNER chased two to three wide until tucked inside through the turn, got coaxed along at the
five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. MAKART four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coaxed along at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and tired. SPETTRO coaxed from the start, chased just off
the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
MISS TEHERAN (IRE) was keen under a tight hold early then reserved on the inside, came under coaxing while continuing to save ground on the far turn,
moved out turning into upper stretch, closed fast to get the lead nearing the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. PLATINUM PAYNTER
settled in the front half of the field on the inside, was urged along on the far turn, gained under a drive in the two path into upper stretch, made a bid inside of
the winner at the furlong marker but proved no match while clear for the place. SUN SUMMERS went around the first turn in the two path, settled off the
pace, was roused while four wide on the far turn then driven six wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response while along for the show. NEW
YORK GIRL (IRE) checked sharply along the rail on the opening straightaway, settled towards the rear while saving ground, was roused outside the
quarter-pole then came under a drive into upper stretch, gained into the final furlong and improved position for the last spot in the superfecta while flattening
out. LAKE LUCERNE broke in and brushed the gate, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on
the far turn, came seven wide into upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole and also improved position. AMNIARIX went three wide on the opening
bend, settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn, floated five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. HOTSY TOTSY (IRE)
navigated the first turn in the four path, settled towards the rear, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked while shifting five wide into the stretch then
angled further out and failed to threaten. STOP WAR was hustled to the lead, raced inside on the first turn, drew off to a sizable advantage on the
backstretch, remained well clear while inside through the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch, was collared by the winner nearing the furlong
marker and tired. ENOLA GAY was taken under a vigorous hold early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CANDY FLOWER tracked in the two path on the first turn, settled well behind the runaway leader
on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path on the far turn then spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
ALOHA WEST three to four wide in pursuit from the tail of the field early on, commenced a four wide bid through the turn into contention swinging five wide
into upper stretch, rallied to latch on the leader a furlong out, dug in dueling to the finish in game fashion and just got up in the shadow of the wire to prevail.
NIGHT TIME hustled from the gate, raced four then three wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn, spun three wide for
home and seized command straightened away, dug in under threat and knocked heads through the final furlong gamely to the finish but was ultimately
nailed at the finish. COST BASIS chased along the inside coming under a firm hold five furlongs out and remaining under that hold in close quarters with
YODEL E. A. WHO, until the three-eighths pole, moved between foes with five-sixteenths to go placing TOWN CLASSIC in tight between himself and
ALOHA WEST, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. MR PHIL showed the way in hand three then two
wide before taking to the rail through the turn under pressure from NIGHT TIME to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside for home, yielded the front straightened away and weakened. YODEL E. A. WHO hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside down the
backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home and offered no response.
RUNNINGWSCISSORS hustled from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, went three wide for home and weakened.
TOWN CLASSIC hustled from the gate, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, got paused and then steadied in tight near the
five-sixteenths as COST BASIS came up inside of him and ALOHA WEST passed by outside, swung five to six wide for home and weakened.

leader while rated under a tight hold, drafted inside early on the far turn, slipped into the two path while asked when EASTER CHOCOLATE began to
weaken at the five-sixteenths, gained to take a short lead in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop coming to the furlong marker, swapped back to
her inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole then moved clear in the final sixteenth under strong handling. BAYSHORE FOXES was asked leaving the gate
and went to the front, dropped from the two path to close to the rail on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was
asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage while put to the crop in upper stretch. fought on with the winner until near the sixteenth-pole but was

chased three then four wide on the far turn, pursued the top two under a drive in the stretch, drifted out inside the furlong marker and lacked the needed kick

ground on the first turn, moved out onto the backstretch, settled under coaxing, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the far turn, swung

Footnotes
Following a thirty minute delay to the post time due to inclement weather that brought lightning to the area, JACKIE'S WARRIOR dueled four then three
wide with DRAIN THE CLOCK to his inside, began to shake off that rival and tucked to the two path through the turn widening away under his own power,
floated five wide into upper stretch, went clear under just barely a hand urging to the finish to score comfortably on the wire. DRAIN THE CLOCK dueled
three then two wide with the aforementioned foe to his outside, tucked inside when shaken off into the turn and gave chase coming under urging with
five-sixteenths to go, swung five wide into upper stretch following the top one , dug in under a drive proving no match while holding safe for the place
honors. CROWDED TRADE broke in at the start and was outrun in the early going chasing four then three wide detached at the tail of the field, went three
then two wide through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show
honors. FLASH OF MISCHIEF four to five paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked two to three wide through the turn put to
encouragement at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. MISTER LUIGI three to four wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. RIVER DOG broke in at the start, chased two to three wide under a ride from three
furlongs out, spun three wide into upper stretch and faltered.
