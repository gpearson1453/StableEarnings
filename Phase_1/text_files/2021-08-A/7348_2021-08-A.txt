Footnotes
ABSOLUTE CHAOS bumped with WELL TOLD in the opening strides, sent for pace, made the running while prompted by MEDAL OF FACT to his outside,
saved ground through the turn while still taking that pace pressure, was pushed along in upper stretch and cleared, and drew off in the lane while drifting
out. MEDAL OF FACT was pushed for pace early but outsprinted to the lead by ABSOLUTE CHAOS, pressed the pace two wide down the backstretch and
through the turn, proved no match for the leader in upper stretch, lost second position midstretch when NAVY SEAL bid inside him in upper stretch, but kept
on well enough to recapture the place despite being carried out by NAVY SEAL. The latter came in and bumped WELL TOLD in the opening strides, chased
the leading pair inside of horses down the backstretch, saved ground in the pocket around the turn, was driven for a bid inside of MEDAL OF FACT in upper
stretch, proved no match for the leader, and flattened late to lose the place. SCIENCE (IRE) was keen while chasing between horses down the backstretch,
continued between horses at the rear of the main group in the three path on the turn, was no match for the leading trio into the lane, but had enough to hold
a minor award while gradually drifting out. WELL TOLD was bumped by NAVY SEAL in the opening strides, subsequently bumped with ABSOLUTE
CHAOS, dropped far behind the rest of the field, took closer order in the four path from near the three eighths, was driven into the lane, and lacked the
needed kick in the final furlong. KHOZAN'S SUCCESS chased three wide early, advanced to attend the pace three wide approaching the half, flattened in
the four path on the turn and had no rally in the lane.

Footnotes
GET NONE came away in good order, controlled the tempo along the inside, turned back the bid JOLINA entering the stretch, shook clear, was kept to task
and held safely. JOLINA tracked the leader to the outside, moved in earnest to engage GET NONE midway through the turn, was unable to go on with that
one but stayed on well to prove best of the rest. RARE ACTION ATTACK bumped with ISABELLACANNETELLA early, moved into contention three deep,
flattened entering the lane, drifted about but had enough left to preserve the minor award. COWGIRL KIMMIE was forwardly placed along the inside, drifted
out a bit leaving the turn, but came up empty in the drive. WHITE LIES was fractious in the gate, bumped with a foe early, settled saving ground, but failed
to make headway. CHROME ATTACK was restless in the gate, was allowed to settle four wide and failed to make headway. ISABELLACANNETELLA was
jostled between rivals early and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MERLIN'S SONG tracked the leader down the backstretch early, continued in the pocket in the two path on the turn, raced into the lane behind the leading
pair, tipped three wide approaching the furlong pole, rallied three wide, led past the sixteenth pole and cleared despite drifting out. LOST IN MANHATTAN
tracked the early pace outside of MERLIN'S SONG, stalked outside of EL ASESINO on the turn, loomed to that foe's outside in upper stretch, took the lead
approaching the furlong pole, but could not hold off MERLIN'S SONG in the final sixteenth. GREENER PASTURES was anxious in the gate, ducked slightly
into the gap in the opening strides, chased inside foes down the backstretch, remained patient in the two path on the turn, swung out for a five-wide drive in
upper stretch, and showed good belated gain. EL ASESINO cleared to the lead, set the pace while saving ground around the turn, carried a narrow lead to
the stretch, was headed by LOST IN MANHATTAN approaching the furlong mark, and flattened out inside. CAN'T HIDE FROM ME chased between horses
two wide, was pushed along for a bid in the four to five path on the turn, came four wide into upper stretch, kept on in range to the sixteenth pole, and
weakened. JEFF THE LION chased three wide down the backstretch, was pushed along into the turn, made a bid in the four path around the bend, but
emptied out in the lane. RIP IT RYAN was awkwardly away and hard to settle, raced in the rear pair inside of PRESIDENT ELECT, was driven in the three
path on the turn, continued under a drive in the lane but did not offer the necessary response. PRESIDENT ELECT settled two wide in the rear pair, was
driven in the four path on the turn and taken six wide in upper stretch, and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
RICHIESINTHEHOUSE was fractious in the gate, came away decently, shadowed the leader to the outside, poked his head in front a furlong out and wore
down the stubborn LOCAMOTOR through the drive. LOCAMOTOR was quick into stride, angled in to set the pace, relinquished the lead near the furlong
marker, fought on but was unable to resist. DEVILEYE settled between rivals, came under a ride nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled to the rail
three-sixteenths out and kicked on well. WHAT'S UP DUDE settled in hand, launched a bold bid three wide leaving the turn, but flattened in the final furlong
and faded. WILE E PEYOTE was forwardly placed along the inside, got through but lacked a response when called upon. READTHECLIFFNOTES settled
saving ground, was caught in tight into the turn, checked hard inside the three furlong marker and failed to threaten thereafter. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER
was allowed to settle outside and failed to respond. D'FEVER was away a step slow and was never a factor. THE JOCKEY OF READTHECLIFFNOTES
LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST HIS STABLE MATE DEVILEYE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE FURLONG MARKER, BUT
FOLLOWING THE REVIEW THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BRAMBLE QUEEN settled near the rear early, launched a bold outside move near the eleven sixteenths, raced outside the leading flight into the second
turn, vied outside NORTHERN ALLIANCE around the far turn, took over into the lane and held under a drive while drifting out. SUMMER DAY settled
toward the rear, inched to closer order two wide into the far turn, chased two wide around that bend, swung six wide into the lane, rallied sharply and was
gaining to the finish. LAUNCH AWAY settled at the rear, trailed through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, edged closer approaching the far turn
but remained in the rear through that bend, rallied inside in upper stretch, altered three wide near the furlong mark, and continued to slice through horses
with good energy. STROLLIN THE BAYOU tracked the leading pair two wide early, raced keenly between horses around the clubhouse turn, chased
between horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, came three wide into the lane, and was outkicked late. KINGSBURY DREAM settled toward
the rear outside of SUMMER DAY through the clubhouse turn and into the backstretch, improved to midpack into the far turn, chased in the four path around
that bend, floated six wide into the lane and lost some position, but passed a few tiring foes late. NORTHERN ALLIANCE was keen early, set a pressured
pace the first time down the stretch, tracked ROMANTIC ATTACK as she cleared into the first turn, continued keenly behind the leader into the backstretch,
went with BRAMBLE QUEEN to clear the rest of the field into the far turn, vied inside that foe around that bend, but was no match turning for home and
weakened. EMBARRASSING tracked the leading pair inside of STROLLIN THE BAYOU through the first turn, was relegated to midfield into the
backstretch, chased three wide around the far turn, dropped inside into the lane, and flattened out. ROMANTIC ATTACK pressed the pace outside of
NORTHERN ALLIANCE the first time down the stretch, took the lead into the first turn, set a pressured pace down the backstretch, was overtaken into the
far turn, tracked the leading pair around that turn while racing inside of RISKY RISKY RISKY, and emptied out between horses. RISKY RISKY RISKY
chased midpack through the first turn, raced keenly three wide down the backstretch and edged forward, raced two wide behind the leading pair into the far
turn, tracked the leading pair two wide around that bend, began to empty out near the quarter pole, steadied in upper stretch and continued to fade.

SHANTISARA (IRE) settled in hand, ranged into striking distance, split horses entering the stretch, quickened once uncovered, engulfed the leaders and
kicked away. OYSTER BOX tracked the pace off of the inside, moved up to engage SPRITZ leaving the second turn, forged a narrow lead, kept on well but
was unable to match strides with the winner. FLOWN was slow into stride, took closer order through the second bend, split rivals entering the lane, finished
well but settled for the minor award. TIME FOR GLORY was close up toward the inside, shifted out and bid between foes, but lacked the needed late
response. DOUBLE BLESSED was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground but failed to make headway when called upon. SPRITZ opened clear, angled
in to set the pace, was collared leaving the second turn and gave way readily once headed. SHESA MYSTERY stalked the pace three wide, moved up to
make a mild bid but came up empty entering the stretch and dropped out.

SANTA BARBARA (IRE) tracked the leading pair in the pocket, raced keenly approaching the three quarters, continued keenly behind the leading pair while
positioned two wide around the far turn, bid two wide into the lane, took the lead approaching the furlong pole and kicked away under a hand ride. MEAN
MARY broke through the gate before the start, was put on the lead, set the pace while NAVAL LAUGHTER stalked directly to her outside through the
clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, took increased pressure inside of that foe through the far turn to the quarter pole, maintained her lead into the
lane, was confronted by SANTA BARBARA in upper stretch, grudgingly ceded the lead to that foe approaching the eighth pole, was no match from there,
but salvaged the place. LEMISTA (IRE) raced at the rear down the stretch for the first time, advanced ahead of JOY EPIFORA approaching the clubhouse
turn, chased two wide around that bend and down the backstretch, continued to chased toward the rear of a still-compact pack in the three path on the far
turn, came three wide into the lane, chased on willingly but missed the place. JOY EPIFORA (ARG) settled in second last early, was relegated to last
approaching the clubhouse turn, continued settled at the rear inside, saved ground through the far turn, raced between horses into the lane to get around
the fading NAVAL LAUGHTER, and lacked the needed rally. NAVAL LAUGHTER raced keenly early, stalked the pace outside of MEAN MARY, turned up
the pressure into the far turn, loomed two wide to the quarter pole, emptied out inside into the lane and faded.

POINT ME BY settled in hand, took closer order through the second turn, shifted out and split horses, dug in once uncovered, was bumped soundly when
TANGO TANGO TANGO came out, shook off that foe and quickly drew away. TANGO TANGO TANGO tracked off of the inside, moved up to engage LIKE
A SALTSHAKER midway through the second turn, gained command into the stretch, drifted out in the drive, bumped POINT ME BY nearing the sixteenth
pole, was unable to go on with that one but dug in to just hold the runner up spot. GINSBURNED was keen into the first turn, tugged his way forward three
deep, leveled into stride after a half, mounted a bold bid four wide, continued on doggedly but settled for the minor award. KING OF MIAMI was allowed to
settle, came under a ride into the second turn, rallied between rivals into the stretch, angled out and was making up ground late. LIKE A SALTSHAKER
opened clear, angled in and controlled the tempo to the second turn, was collared wide five-sixteenths to run, stayed on to the final furlong and succumbed.
THERIDEOFALIFETIME settled saving ground, got through entering the stretch, moved out a bit for the final furlong but toiled fruitlessly. MR. UNIVERSE
passed only the tiring ones. NEW YEAR SURPRISE made an early move rushing to contention on the backstretch four deep, but came up empty on the
second turn and dropped out. SHADIZAAR was allowed to settle, tucked in to save ground, but lacked a response when called upon.

TWO EMMYS soon cleared, set a comfortable pace while saving ground, was confronted by BIZZEE CHANNEL approaching the quarter pole, shook that
foe off into the lane, opened up when pushed in upper stretch, stayed on when confronted by DOMESTIC SPENDING late and held driving. DOMESTIC
SPENDING (GB) tracked the leading trio two wide down the stretch the first time, chased behind the leading trio through the clubhouse turn and down the
backstretch, was pushed along in the five path on the far turn, raced four wide into the lane, responded with a rally, found his best stride in the final sixteenth
of a mile but came too late to reel in the pacesetter. GLYNN COUNTY was herded outward in the opening strides, settled toward the rear inside in the
opening quarter mile, continued in the second to last flight inside of ZULU ALPHA through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, continued toward
the rear in the four path on the far turn, angled inward near the five sixteenths and came into the lane in the two path, began to improve position, shifted
three wide midstretch and continued to run on with interest. SPACE TRAVELLER (GB) was grazed by ZULU ALPHA in the opening strides, proved hard to
settle when in tight behind GLYNN COUNTY and along the rail the first time down the stretch, raced inside of ARMORY in the rear flight, continued toward
the rear in the two path through the far turn, came into the lane inside while still near the rear, was driven up the inside down the lane and rallied well.
BIZZEE CHANNEL stumbled at the break, tracked the leader while racing keenly down the stretch for the first time, tracked the leading pair through the
clubhouse turn, raced keenly behind the leader down the backstretch, shifted two wide approaching the five sixteenths for a bid outside of TWO EMMYS,
loomed approaching the quarter pole, was rebuffed into the lane, and flattened out between horses. ARMORY (IRE) settled three wide in the rear group in
the opening quarter mile, raced two wide in the rear flight into the clubhouse turn, continued outside of SPACE TRAVELLER in the rear flight down the
backstretch and in the three to four path on the far turn, raced four wide into the lane, and passed tiring horses. ZULU ALPHA came out and grazed SPACE
TRAVELLER in the opening strides, raced between horses near the rear during the first run down the stretch, settled two wide in the second to last flight
outside of GLYNN COUNTY, continued outside that foe through the first turn, down the backstretch, and in the five path around the far turn, was driven five
wide into the lane and came up empty while drifting out. STRONG TIDE broke outwardly, raced keenly inside behind the leading pair early, tipped outside of
BIZZEE CHANNEL approaching the clubhouse turn, advanced to track outside of TWO EMMYS through the clubhouse turn, continued in tracking position
down the backstretch and in the four path through much of the far turn, emptied out between horses approaching the quarter, and had no further response
when driven in upper stretch.

ANOTHER MYSTERY was unhurried into stride, advanced between rivals, shifted to the outside leaving the second turn, struck the front near the furlong
marker and drew away. CAMMACK attended the pace along the inside, slipped through and came to level terms with three-sixteenths to run, continued on
well but was unable to match strides with his stable mate. BLUE SKY KOWBOY settled saving ground, tipped out and split horses to make a bold bid
entering the stretch, but flattened in the final yards. IWILLPERSEVERE prompted the pace to the outside of FLY NIGHTLY to the stretch, was collared
between horses and weakened during the drive. FLY NIGHTLY set the pressured pace along the inside, drifted out a bit leaving the second turn, faltered
between runners in the final furlong and faded. TUFF ATTACK failed to make headway. BULLDOG OF BERGEN contended three wide to the second turn
and dropped out.
