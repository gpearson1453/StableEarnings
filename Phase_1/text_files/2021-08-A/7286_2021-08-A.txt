had a mild gain on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was second best. CAPTAIN SIDNEY was in touch, roused from the inside on the
turn and was up for show. TINKER RING was in range and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch leveled off. LUCKY STREET
stalked the early leader but lost ground on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was empty.

Footnotes
DOCTOR UPTOWN was settled off the early leaders, roused from between foes on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch fought
gamely for the win. DEEP EXPLORER was in touch, forced the pace on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch just missed. REMEMBER
THE MAINE showed speed from the inside, raced evenly on the far turn and had the lead in mid stretch but was outgunned. THE MIGHTY JUDGE was
unhurried early and gained ground on the far turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch evened out. BAY OF RUM set a pressured pace and had a
slim lead on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. NIGHT WATCHMAN was off the pace and saved ground on the far
turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no threat. EMBRACE MY UNCLE was in range and hustled along on the far turn but dropped back
through the stretch.

YOU'RE ALL RIGHT was away alertly, had a slim lead on the turn, vied through the stretch and prevailed. WORKING THE TABLE showed speed from the
outside, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. C BY THE SEA was unhurried early, had a
mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. GRAPES was hustled early and raced evenly on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. MAKE IT RAIN had no speed and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
had no response. J M R SILENT LAKE was off slow, showed little and from the six path at the top of the stretch had no impact. ROYAL BOURBON was in
mid pack early but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
BENADETTE'S LADY was in touch, raced evenly from the inside on the far turn and with a bid in mid stretch was up in time. IT'SNICETOBENICE stalked
the early leader, forced the pace on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. FEATURE CREATURE was in range and a
factor on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. MARTINI SUE set the pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave
way. TACKLE THE NORTH was unhurried early, saved ground on the far turn and angled out in mid stretch and finished evenly. LONDONDERRY showed
no speed and was hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch leveled off. STARDUST KITTEN was well back and had a mild
gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was no threat. FLECK was in mid pack early but lost ground on the far turn and had no
rally. ROMANTIC BLISS settled off the pace but chased on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was empty. GLIB MARYLIN was off
the pace, carried wide on the far turn and had no impact.
