FIRE DIAMONDS sat off of the pace while saving ground, waited nearing the top of the stretch, found a hole along the rail nearing the furlong marker and
got by COCOA CENTS to kick clear in the end to prevail. COCOA CENTS set a pedestrian pace through the second turn, was confronted by her stablemate
nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the final going but held for second. BIG ENOUGH was unhurried in the early stages, was two then three wide on
the second turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch but was outfinished by the top two. PULPIT SINGER tracked the pace through the second turn, was
in contention into the stretch but gave way in the drive. AROUSE N GO stalked the slow fractions, was four then five wide on the second turn and tired in the
stretch run.

MAGGIE'S MAGIC broke sharply and was sent to set the contested pace through the turn while saving ground, extended the lead off of the turn and drew
away in the end as much the best. MARK WHATS MINE tracked the leaders from the rear through the turn while saving ground and was outfinished in the
stretch but did get up in the late stages to get the place. MERGIE TROID chased the pace while traveling along the rail on the turn and weakened in the
stretch run, but did hold on for third. GEE STREET settled toward the rear of the field, was five wide on the turn and did not rally in the stretch. DESERT
FOG dueled with the winner for pace duties early, kept up that pressure while three wide on the turn but was outrun into the stretch and tired in the late
going. WAHASHA chased the dueling pacesetters into the turn while four wide and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LAST INNING contested the pace by WITH OPEN EYES through the second turn while under a snug hold from the rider, came to terms with that rival
nearing the top of the stretch, dueled and won the nod on the wire to prevail. WITH OPEN EYES set contested fractions while saving ground, was headed
by the winner, dueled for the length of the stretch and was just nipped on the wire while a clear second over the rest. SUNSET STAR settled toward the rear
of the field while saving ground, gained ground on the second turn but was outfinished by the top two. MIRACLE OF HOPE was unhurried in the early going,
was four wide on the second turn while improving position and continued that run into the early stretch but flattened out in the late stages. ASHLEY
BEAUTIFUL sat just off of the contending pacesetters while saving ground through the second turn, was outrun off of that turn and faded in the stretch run.
UNUSUAL DANCER tracked the pace through the second turn while three wide, lost ground into the stretch, lost action nearing the furlong marker,
stumbled, unseated the jockey and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING #4 UNUSUAL DANCER
AND RULED THAT THE RUNNER LOST ACTION, STUMBLED AND UNSEATED THE RIDER ON HER OWN ACCOUNT AND THERE WOULD NOT BE
A CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER.

Footnotes
STORMING WARRIOR was away last of the field and settled at the rear, trailed on the second turn while in the three path, mounted a rally coming off of the
turn, tipped out in the lane and had a bold late kick to nail DARCEE'S LOVE DOVI in the final yards to prevail. DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI sat just off of the early
leaders, was five wide on the second turn, gained ground off of the turn, took the lead from ALIBI FOR MISCHIEF, led into the final yards and was nailed on
the line by the winner while holding for second. ALIBI FOR MISCHIEF prompted the early fractions, continued to pressure SLEEP OVER into the second
turn while three wide, took the lead off of the turn and was tiring but stubbornly kept on until passed by DARCEE'S LOVI DOVI in the final stages, just
missing for second. EXETER settled just off of the pace in the early going, gained ground while four wide on the second turn but was outfinished by the top
three in the stretch. LOOKIN FOR GOLD chased the pace while saving ground and weakened in the late going. SLEEP OVER broke alertly and set the all
of the pace while being pressured, saved ground on the second turn, was confronted leaving the turn and faded in the stretch run. ANOTHER CHAMP
stalked the pace through the second turn, lost position on that turn while three wide and gave out in the stretch.

JEANNE B prompted the early pace, saved ground on the turn while in the two path, swung to the three path for the stretch drive then slipped onto the rail to
mount a bid, confronted OSCAR NOD and LA REINE'S LEGACY in the final sixteenth and edged away in the end. OSCAR NOD dueled with LA REINE'S
LEGACY for pace duties in the early going, was three wide on the turn, took the lead off of the turn, was confronted by the winner in the late going and was
outkicked while a clear second over the rest. LA REINE'S LEGACY dueled with OSCAR NOD on the front end through the turn while saving ground, gave
up the lead to that rival heading into the stretch and was outfinished by the top two. AUSTRIAN NAVY settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on
the turn and did not offer a bid in the stretch. JAN JAN CAN was away slowly and chased the field from the rear, saved ground on the turn and did not rally
in the stretch. ONLY THE FACTS stalked the pace, was four wide on the turn, lost ground off of the turn and faded in the late going. B B KIDDO tracked the
leaders into the turn while five wide, was outrun off of the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HONG KONG COWBOY broke alertly and set all of the pace through the second turn while saving ground, extended the lead off of the turn and was kept to
task through the lane to draw clear in the end. GOING AWAY PARTY prompted the pace of the winner through the second turn, was three wide between
horses on that turn, lost a bit of ground leaving the second turn and was outkicked by the winner while besting the rest. COLOUR ME HAPPY (GB) stalked
the pace through the second turn, was four wide on the second turn and was outfinished by the top two. SUNNY SPOT threw his head leaving the start and
spotted the field six lengths, was hustled to sit just off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn and did not offer a bid in the stretch. OH BE ONE
settled in the midflight while saving ground on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch. PURR CAT was unhurried in the early going, was
four wide on the second turn and made a mild late gain in the stretch. ARNO'S MANE MAN sat off of the early pace, saved ground on the second turn while
two wide and did not rally in the stretch drive. UNPOSSIBLE settled toward the rear of the field, was three wide on the second turn and was not a factor.
