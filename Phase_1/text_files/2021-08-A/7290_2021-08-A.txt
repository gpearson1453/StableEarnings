the wire and prevailed for the win. MOM SAID YES void of early speed, raced outside around the second turn, dueled down the stretch, was outfinished for
the win, but proved best of others. CROQUE MONSIEUR (GB) vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, took command down the home
stretch, but proved no match for the top two late. PERFECTURE lacked early speed, finished evenly and was no factor. IADANZA dueled for the early
advantage and was finished early. BRANDI BO DANDY pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
BLULU pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch and prevailed for the win. EBBI BLU lacked early speed, made a late rally,
racing wide and finished willingly. JOANIE GAL broke slow, racing from the rear, moved up, four wide around the turn and gained ground. SIMPLE
SUNDAY raced within striking distance, came around the turn three wide and lacked a late kick. NAVAGATIONALBEACON went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground around the turn and faded. SNAP IT void of early speed, improved position, finished wide and was no factor. PRINCESS STRATEGY raced
within contention and was finished early. ORENA STARSHINE was an early factor and dropped back. MS. SPARKLING JET always raced near the back
and showed little. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
