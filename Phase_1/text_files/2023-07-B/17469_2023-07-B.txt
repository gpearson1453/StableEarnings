Footnotes
GRAN MANNA pressed the pace four across, challenged for the lead entering the stretch, dueled to late stretch and drew clear. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC vied
inside, fell back on the turn, came again to contend, hung late and finished second best. SHAKE RAG set a pressured pace while racing between horses,
was unable to sustain her bid and was all out for show. TIZ FOR REAL raced close to the pace, angled out for the drive, closed well and didn't have enough
late. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T was void of early speed, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well. LITTLE SAMURAI was never far back, lacked a stretch
response and was not a threat. ROBTHEQUEEN raced close to the pace along the inside, was steadied into the turn, dropped back and gave way.
BINALLOVERDRINKEN broke slowly, was taken outside, vied three across and stopped on the turn. FI FI D'ORO was pulled up and vanned off.
