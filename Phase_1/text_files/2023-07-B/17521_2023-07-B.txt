Footnotes
ANNA B was sent to the front to set the pace and held well in a driving finish. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT got away well, stalked the pace, went five wide
entering the stretch and closed well to get up for place. IM STILL THIRSTY stalked the pace, went willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late and held for
show. PLAIN TAP WATER was last away from the gate, raced mid pack between horses, rallied into the turn, bid off the rail and finished well. SOULONG
was slow early, steadied at the top of the stretch and dropped back. WILD FIREWATER was outrun in an even effort. RIO HATO raced mid pack along the
inside, fell back into the turn, was checked in the upper stretch and not urged thereafter. BACK TO WORK fell and was vanned off.

earned show. STORMIN FAST raced close to pace along the inside, awaited room, bid and came up empty. TEQUILA TIME veered out at the start, dueled
to the turn and gave way. SHANE ZAIN broke slowly, raced wide and lacked a bid. THIRSTY ECHO vied inside, was checked entering the turn, dropped

bid, improved position. BONFIRE PARTY broke out, in close, through early. SALTIE FIRE vied between horses, fell back turn, faded. RED HOT CAT saved
ground, got through rail turn, no response. LOTTA GUSTO vied inside to turn, gave way, not urged stretch.
