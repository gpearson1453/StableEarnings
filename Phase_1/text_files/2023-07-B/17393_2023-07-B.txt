Footnotes
THEO D'OR quickly found himself on the lead, raced on the rail, had competitors stalking just off of his side, led by a length at the half mile pole, was cued
at the three eighths pole, responded to right handed crop and drew off even more, was encouraged with left handed crop and continued down the stretch,
had a closing outside foe threatening but was kept on point, made it to the wire first. MO CREDO settled far off of the pace and was last by many, was
allowed to find his stride, moved at the half mile pole, shifted into the three path and split horses at the three eighths pole, was hand ridden and encouraged,
drifted in a step was corrected and pushed, responded well by gaining ground, drifted out a bit late but nearly caught the winner, just missing. REVERENT
vied for the lead, briefly drew next to the leader, took back and stalked just off of the leaders hip, could not stay with the leader and chased into the stretch,
was collared by an outside closer in the stretch, failed to switch leads and tired. MR. CROMWELL hopped at the start, settled into a stalking position in the
three path, maintained that position and ran even. FREE FROM GUILT was never involved.

pace, raced in the four path, moved at the half mile pole, followed the eventual winner around the turn and into the stretch .responded well to
encouragement and closed chasing the leader, no match for winner but second best today. OPTIMISTIC stalked the pace from the two path, raced with a
rival on his outside, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, advanced and challenged for the lead at the quarter pole, was quickly passed by an outside
closer and then finished even. BIG POWER RED raced in the middle of hte field, stayed on the rail, advanced position at the half mile marker and had no
late kick in the stretch. LORD DRAGON was off of the pace early, raced in the two path as he traveled down the backside, launched a bid a the half,
improved position, shifted into the five path through the turn, then six path, seven path down the stretch, was asked and tried to close but to no avail.
ROCKDALE vied for the lead, raced on the rail as he attended the pace, was challenged at the five sixteenth pole, battled into the upper stretch, then was
passed by a fast closing VIM AND VIGOR and tired. MAX PANDOWDY was off in the middle of the field, raced in between horses in the three path,
maintained that position through out. GET WITT GONE stalked from the three path on the out side of another rival, shifted out at the three eights pole and

Footnotes
DANAS MULE stalked the pace setter from in between horses , raced three wide, was driven through the turn and chased the leader in the stretch, was kept
on point, gained ground, was determined, cleared the leader in the last few strides taking the win. BITSY'S DOUBLE DAY vied for the lead, raced on the
rail, set the fractions, almost went wire to wire but was caught in the last few jumps, but still ran a game race and a nice second. DON'T BLINK TWICE
raced off of the pace early, saved ground on the rail, launched a bid at the half mile pole, shifted out into the six path in the upper stretch, responded well to
hand riding and encouragement, closed well and out finished the rest. BEAUCLAIRE stalked the front runners, raced in between rivals, traveled in the three
path, moved at the three eights pole, drew next to the eventual winner, shifted into the two path in the stretch and tired. CHATAIN'S EAGLE was last after
the start, saved ground and moved along the rail, improved position and was in touch with the field by the three eighths pole, was three wide in the turn,
smartly angled back to the inside in the upper stretch, closed well. QUEENS RIOT raced five wide in the second flight of horses, was widest around the turn,
struggled to switch leads and tired in the stretch. JESSOLOGY vied for the lead, raced in the two path and stalked, was on the inside of the second flight of
competitors, saved ground through out but could not sustain the bid and tired late. PREPAID SPECIAL had no impact. WHEELS LIKE NALA stalked from in
between horsed in the four path, lost ground in the turn and faded. TENSAS CLEAR raced from off of the pace in the three path, found her stride and
started gaining ground, had momentum building and was strong into the turn, had to steady repeatedly, was through after that. BONJOOR MADEMOISEL
stalked from the rail in the third flight of horses, then gave way.
