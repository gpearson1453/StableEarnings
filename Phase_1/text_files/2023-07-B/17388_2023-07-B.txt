Footnotes
DEMAR'S LEGACY bumped with an inner foe at the start, vied for the lead with an inner rival from the three path into the turn, was cued from the two path
into the stretch, battled with that inner rival through the stretch and brushed passing the eighth pole, and inched away late. BIGBOUQUETOFROSES dueled
with the outer eventual winner from the two path into the turn, stuck a head in front while under a nudge early around the turn, lost that advantage and was
ridden along the rail approaching the quarter, fought on gamely and dueled from the rail down the lane, brushed passing the eighth pole, and was edged out
late to place. SPICY GUACAMOLE raced up close in the five path, lost ground under a drive in the three path rounding the turn, tipped out to the four path
into the stretch, and ran on for show. LLAMARADA was behind in the seven path going into the turn, was driven form the five path into the stretch, but made
no impact. MIGUEL'S BELLE had a slow start, chased in the five path, floated out to the seven path into the lane, and did not threaten. KAITIE KAIT
bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the early pace inside, but had to check passing the half, and failed to menace.

CINDYLOUWHO set a rated pace in the two path and widened under a drive. TAMARINDO raced off the pace four and five wide and finished well to gain
the place late. FISH MOONEY stalked the winner in the three path, could not match strides with that foe in upper stretch and was narrowly outfinished for
the place. STARSHIP AGENDA was bumped not long after the start, steadied entering the first turn, rasced well back two wide, advanced five wide around
the far turn but lacked the needed stretch rally. SMART SPENDING was bumped between rivals not long after the start, bumped again entering the first
turn, raced in range three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. SENSITIVITY was bumped early, saved ground and never
threatened. IRAZU was bumped entering the first turn, chased the pace two and three wide and had no response. ON ALERT tracked the pace inside and
came up empty in the lane.

BIG DATA settled off the pace inside, made a rail bid nearing the quarter pole, took over turning for home and drew off under a drive. LOCO ABARRIO
raced in range four wide, bid three deep nearing the quarter pole, turned for home on even terms but was no match for the winner in the lane. MR. PEEKS
set the pace in the two path, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on well enough to hold the show. KNOX failed to menace
while racing four wide. THIS RUN'S FOR YOU prompted the pace in the three path and tired after six furlongs. TIGRE was up close two wide and faded
around the turn.

UNCLE B settled early to track the leader in the two path, was nudged along into the turn, chased the outer leader from the three path into the lane, and
surged past in the final sixteenth. HOPE IN HIM brushed with an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside, floated out around the turn and was cued from
the five path into the stretch, but was caught by a late surging inner foe to place. SIGILOSO raced wellback in the four path, was driven around the turn and
swung out to the six path into the lane, and kept on for show. COMPETITIVE SAINT raced off the pace in the two path, was ridden in the three path turning
into the stretch, and stayed on between foes. EXECUTIVE SEARCH raced in midpack around the three path, tipped out to five path into the lane, and mildly
gained. LITTLE JUANITO brushed with an outer foe at the start, chased inside but faded in the stretch. EMBER always trailed along the inside.

Footnotes
STAT set a rated pace in the two path, drew off in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. VOLCANIC pressed the winner in the three path, could not
match strides late on the turn or in upper stretch then was gaining quickly in the later yards. MUTAAWID raced off the pace four wide and rallied belatedly.
CAPTAIN ANTHONY failed to menace while racing three wide around the first turn and five wide around the far turn. THE MAR raced up close inside and
faded through the stretch. SURROGATE played no factor while racing two wide. UNO TIGER was in tight at the start and was outrun while racing two and
three wide. AMBOR NIGHT chased the pace three and four wide and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
MARTINI'S AMICA bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path and was under coaxing early into the turn, began to rally from the five path
at the top of the lane, surged between foes passing the eighth pole, then angled to the rail while continuing to rally and was up in the final strides.
ACQUIRED TASTE travelled off the pace in the four path, was roused between foes passing the quarter, swung out to the six path into the stretch, ran on
outside of foes, and just missed to place. AREUOKWITHTHIS pressed between the leading duo in the two path, took a short lead into the lane, and kept on
but was caught on both sides late to show. GHOST FORCE was prompted along in the two path, tipped out under a ride around the turn and was in the five
path entering the stretch, and stayed on but missed the minors. LTE STARK WINTER rated inside and finished evenly down the lane. LUMINANT chased in
the five path but made no impact from the seven path in the stretch. BIOTECHNOLOGY vied for the lead in the three path, stuck a head in front passing the
quarter, but faded from the four path in the final furlong. MISS GOLDIE bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside early but yielded turning
into the lane.
