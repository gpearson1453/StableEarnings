HAPPYSECRET quick speed, opened up to the turn with all pace and held sway to the wire while eased up late. ISABEL DE CLARE broke slow from the
gate, no speed to turn, rail run for place. AUGURI chased pace to the turn and weakened late for show spot. I'VE BEEN THINKIN no speed to the turn, late
run to improve in the stretch run. HOP SNIP ANDA JUMP tried to keep up from inside to the stretch, faltered in drive. WILL VIRGINIA DARE through early,
faltered back readily. TRANQUIL TIMES never threatened. CAPTIVE STAR never menaced throughout. KENTE KLARKE inside trip while fading back.
