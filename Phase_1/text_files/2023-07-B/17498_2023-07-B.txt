Footnotes
HARBOR SKY took back to track the fast early pace, was steered outside of rivals into the turn and raced three wide to the quarter marker, was roused four
wide into the stretch, responded to firm urging inside of the furlong pole, rallied in the final sixteenth while widest, caught HAY JUAN in deep stretch and
inched away in a drive in the final strides. HAY JUAN was hustled to be close to the solid early pace, pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker and
continued to duel with SPEEDY TOM into the stretch, took a narrow lead heading to the final sixteenth, was caught in the final strides by HARBOR SKY and
just held for second at the finish. MY DOMINATOR settled off of the fast early pace while saving ground, made a mild advance heading to the furlong pole,
finished well in the late stages and just missed for second while securing third. SPEEDY TOM broke sharply and showed good early speed, dictated terms
to the turn then set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, battled with HAY JUAN to mid-stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals in the final stages and
was outfinished. OBVIOUS chased the fast pace from the inside, lost ground heading to the furlong marker and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
HOT CHICKS ONLY took back off of the decent early pace, was steered outside of rivals and was roused five wide into the stretch, closed fast inside of the
furlong marker, reeled in his stablemate in deep stretch and was up in the final strides for the win. HYDRO FROST was sent leaving the start and set the
pace to the turn, was well handled while off of the rail through the bend, extended the lead heading to mid-stretch, was all out to hold off his stablemate in
deep stretch, was nailed on the line for the win and was well clear of the rest for second. UNION GIG raced close to the decent early pace, kept attendance
to HYDRO FROST while outside of that rival through the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and lost position heading to the furlong grounds, was not able to
impact the top pair in the final sixteenth and outfinished the others to secure third. LASMUIGH (GB) chased the decent pace from the inside, tipped two wide
for the stretch drive, gained ground approaching the furlong marker, could not sustain that bid in the final stages and weakened. CHAOKOON chased the
decent pace while outside of rivals, came four wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to the furlong pole and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
BANDERA AZTECA was sent to establish the early lead and assumed command into the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted through the
backstretch run, was confronted by QUE SERA SIR RALPH heading to the quarter marker, repelled that effort and shook free into the stretch, was kept to
task under firm urging to the sixteenth-marker, felt late pressure from QUE SERA SIR RALPH and determinedly held the runner-up at bay in the final strides
to prevail. QUE SERA SIR RALPH was asked to show early speed and was prominent into the first turn, prompted the moderate pace while outside of
BANDERA AZTECA through the backstretch run, drew to even terms with the pacesetter along the far turn, was repelled into upper stretch and chased
BANDERA AZTECA to the furlong grounds, re-rallied in deep stretch but could not get by the determined winner and just missed in a good effort.
TWIRLING DERBY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the moderate pace from the inside through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground
heading to the quarter marker, was steered into the four path in upper stretch and chased the leaders to the furlong pole, closed in the final sixteenth but
could not get by the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for third. HOUSE OF LORDS settled between rivals in the early stages, slipped to the
inside entering the second turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. GALLANT WARREN was
allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals into the backstretch run, gained a bit of ground heading to the half-mile marker, was coaxed along three wide on the
second turn, was asked for run four wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

of the rail and raced three paths deep into upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong grounds, was kept to task under steady urging to the final
sixteenth, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted in the final strides for the win. SNAKE ISLAND was a bit slow into stride early on and settled at the

sixteenth, pressured the winner in the late stages but could get by BIG DON'S SMILING and missed for the win, while holding safely for second. MADE THE

Footnotes
VANISKY was sent leaving the break and showed the way into the first turn, set a pressured pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, ceded the
lead to SAFE COMBINATION and tracked that rival to the half-mile marker, re-engaged along the far turn and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took
command in upper stretch and was set down for the drive, was confronted by SPEED GRAZY inside of the furlong marker, met that bid to deep stretch, dug
in in the final strides and lasted at the finish for a determined win. SPEED GRAZY settled outside of rivals in the early running, was asked to move forward
along the backstretch run and stalked the decent pace from a three wide path into the far turn, continued to improve while three deep nearing the quarter
marker, chased VANISKY into the stretch, drew to even terms with that rival inside of the furlong marker, dueled outside of VANISKY to deep stretch, could
not get by the determined winner in the final strides and was gamely bested, while clear of the rest. CANYON CREST was unhurried in the early running,
saved ground into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, could not impact the top two in the final
sixteenth but closed well in deep stretch and was up in time to secure third. EL JOY settled just off of the moderate early pace and raced between rivals into
the backstretch run, gained ground along the backstretch run, slipped to the inside heading to the far turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, ran
evenly to mid-stretch, could not sustain his run into the final stages and flattened out. SAFE COMBINATION was prominent in the early stages and
prompted the pace into the backstretch run, made a middle move to vie for the lead and took a narrow lead heading to the half-mile marker, continued to
dispute the pace while outside of VANISKY into the far turn, lost position in upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. ITS THIEVERY settled in the second
flight while saving ground, was well placed through the backstretch run, lost position along the far turn, was coaxed along three wide into the drive and came
up empty in the late stages.

Footnotes
ZIPPY BABY tracked the fast early pace while outside of rivals, chased outside of an inner rival along the turn, was roused nearing the top of the lane and
swung widest for the drive, mounted a four wide rally nearing mid-stretch and loomed at the sixteenth-marker, made a quick move to take command in deep
stretch and drove clear in the final stages. DR PESCADO chased the fast early pace from the second flight, saved ground along the turn then tipped two
wide for the drive, responded to urging at mid-stretch and came within approaching the sixteenth-marker, raced in tight quarters heading into deep stretch
and split foes in the final yards, could not match strides with ZIPPY BABY and was up in time to secure second. TWO TWELVE was sent to assume
command leaving the break, showed good early speed and drew to a clear lead heading to the turn, drew off along the bend, came back to the field in upper
stretch, was caught by ZIPPY BABY inside of the sixteenth-marker and was just edged for second at the finish, while just holding for third. GALOPIN
GOURMET raced closest to the loose pacesetter in the early stages, chased TWO TWELVE to the quarter marker, was coaxed along three wide into the
stretch, came within aim at the furlong marker, checked slightly in traffic in deep stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and missed for the minor awards.
RESPOND was crowded a bit leaving the start and was off a step slowly, chased from the inside along the turn, was gaining in the stretch but was unable to
threaten in the final stages. WART was slow into stride and was a bit hard to place while along the rail in the early stages, was steered to the three path
heading to the turn and chased the fast pace along the bend, lost contact into upper stretch and did not factor.

TAMANTARI broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace, chased outside of rivals along the turn and was roused five wide into the lane, loomed at

Footnotes
DR LOW KEY broke out at the start and caused a chain reaction without contact, sped to the front and had short lead racing inside of a trio intent on
contesting the early going, backed off a bit before the turn then re-bid and slipped through an opening on the inside near the five-sixteenths marker, opened
up under a strong hand ride while being allowed to drift towards the center the stretch then ducked out sharply near the wire from a left handed reminder but
held on. WILD BILLY D allowed to settle into stride from the break, raced in the three to four path down the backstretch run and stayed wide through the
turn, tipped out to the seven path for the stretch run and rallied strongly for the place. WICKLOW HILLS was bumped lightly by EDDIE CROSSWIRE just
after the break, then raced at the head of the tracking group down the backstretch, made good forward progress through the turn while racing four wide,
responded when asked to go after the leaders near the five-sixteenths pole, lugged in and had trouble changing leads through the stretch and was
outfinished for second. EDDIE CROSSWIRE pinballed after the start getting the worst of the chain reaction, chased the leading group to the turn, took the
inside path into the stretch and ran on evenly while never a threat to the top three. EL BERRINCHES was forced out after the break by SPLIT ACES and
bumped EDDIE CROSSWIRE, then raced clear of the trouble and was quickly on the outside of a trio contesting the early pace, continued to battle with
SPLIT ACES through the turn then weakened at the quarter pole, was spent from early efforts and struggled home. ZHIVAGO stumbled slightly at the start
then veered outward without bothering anyone, straightened but was outrun to the turn, angled to the outside three to four wide for clear run, swung out five
wide into the stretch and finished with some interest but was unable to find another gear when needed. SPLIT ACES shied outward from DR LOW KEY at
the break making some contact with EL BERRINCHES, recovered quickly to get a piece of the early pace and raced between three horses contesting the
early lead, began to tire approaching the quarter pole and faded to the rear then had nothing to offer down the stretch.
