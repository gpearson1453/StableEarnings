Footnotes
INDY BIZ set the pace into the first turn while moving into the turn from the three path, widened through the backstretch, continued to widen when under
minimal urging, extended the advantage through the lane while under minimal encouragement. SAN RONIN chased the winner from the outset while near
the inside, continued closest to the top one in late turn, lost the place spot into the lane then stayed on to regain the runner-up spot through the final
sixteenth. SEMINOLE AUSTIN was unhurried into the backstretch, bid into the far turn while three wide and in the four path, continued under a drive into the
lane to get nearest the winner then tired and lost the place spot late. GRAY MIKE chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was asked for more
into the lane and tired. JACK THE BIRD never a factor while racing in mid-pack through the far turn. RUNNING SMART was steadied between rivals into
the first turn, continued near the inside into the far turn, raced in the four path through the turn and steadily lost ground. BINNINGTON BLUES raced along
the inside into the far turn, came off the inside in late turn and into the lane and was empty. QUALITY DANCER saved ground throughout and steadily
faded. INEEDRELIEF was outrun while off the inside.

Footnotes
SIGNATURE STREET chased the pace from the inside through the turn and into the lane, came off the rail when straightening, caught the leader near the
eighth pole and drove past. CIERRA EMPIRE raced along the inside through the turns, bid into the lane from the two path and was up for place spot.
SHEZA NUT raced on a clear pace while near the inside, continued clear through late turn, was caught near the eighth pole, yielded to the winner and lost
the place spot late while saving the show spot. AMERICANA ANNA saved ground through the turn, came into the lane from four or five path and showed
late energy to be gaining to the wire. NORA'S STAR was in the two or three path through the turns, was asked for more approaching the quarter pole then
weakened after straightening in the lane. TAP THE LINE raced three wide through the first turn, continued in the four path through the far turn and never
was a factor. BICKERMENTS was unhurried while off the rail through the far turn, bid into the lane from the five path, was under a strong drive to inside the
eighth pole and was suddenly done near the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
SPOTTY SHOWERS raced along the inside through the turn, moved up through late turn, tipped into the two or three path, took aim on the leader once
straightened then surged past and fittingly won during a rain shower. WILLADEAN raced on a clear pace while near the inside, widened into the lane,
looked to be a winner near the eighth pole but was no match for the surging winner through the final eighth while staying on to be clear for the place spot.
LITTLE GRAY FLOWER in mid-pack while off the rail into the turn, moved through the three path through mid-turn, swung into the lane from the seven path
and was up for the show spot. BIRDSOFAFEATHER bid four wide through the turn, came into the lane from the six path and was never a threat through the
final eighth. ZIPSY ROSE LEE was well back while in the two path through the far turn, angled into the eight path for the drive then moved up while not a
menace. MISS DIAMOND RICH was three wide through the first turn, continued off the inside through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and
moved up. PRETTY HEART was in the two path into the far turn when never far back, asked into the lane and was empty. MALI BALI chased the pace
along the inside through the turn and into the lane then retreated. ARRINGTON was never a factor while racing far back. EMERSON'S DREAM chased the
pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide through the turn then folded up entering the lane. TEN LIL VICTORIES chased the pace from the
three path into the turn, was two wide through the turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
TIME TO RACE trailed for half while near the inside, angled four wide in late turn when gaining momentum, came into the lane four wide then continued with
energy to quickly catch the leader and clear. MS. LILIBET chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid into the lane from the two or three path,
gained a short lead straightening in the lane, still lead with an eighth to go then was no match for the top one but stayed on to be clear for the place spot.
PAINT ME PERFECT raced along the inside through the turn, waited in late turn, came off the inside and into the two or three path when moving past tired
one, angled in toward the inside near the eighth pole and finished with energy. ROBIN SAGE saved ground through the turn, guided to the four path in
upper stretch, was in good position with an eighth to go then flattened late. FLURR never a factor while near the inside. THESTRAL bid three wide through
the turn, swung into the lane from the five path then drifted out after brushing with rival and was empty. LAST CHANCE DANCE chased the pace from the
two path into the turn then faded through the lane. MISCHIEF LILY set the pace on a loose lead into the far turn then was empty turning into the lane.
AGENT was three wide into the far turn and was suddenly done in mid-turn.
