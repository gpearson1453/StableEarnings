Footnotes
SWEET LITTLE LISA bumped repeatedly at the start, was never far off the pace, rallied on the turn, closed willingly and drew off under urging. CHROME
RACER was void of early speed, found her best stride late, was gaining ground and finished second best. GO ON GIRL settled off the pace in a good
position, rallied leaving the turn, loomed a threat, came up empty late and settled for show. SHORT STRAW came out at the start, set the pace, bore out in
the drive and gave way. RUTH OF JUDAH was a bit reluctant to load, broke out to be off a step slowly and improved position in an even effort.
GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN broke out, raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. SILVER EYES bumped repeatedly at the start, saved
ground while unhurried early, offered a mild bid only and was in traffic late.

Footnotes
ICE BLAST set the pace and held safely while kept to task. GAGOOTS was pushed out at the start, raced outside, closed steadily and earned place while
no threat to the winner. CHRISTMAS PRESENT was pushed in and bumped at the start, bumped entering the first turn, stalked the pace, had little left late
and prevailed in a battle for show. NOT VERY GENTLE was crowded, bumped and stumbled at the start, raced inside, bid, hung and was outfinished for
third. PISTOL BOX saved ground to the second turn, swung wide entering the stretch and lacked a response. BIG BLUE came in at the start, bumped
entering the first turn, raced close to the pace towards the outside, tired on the second turn and dropped back. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR was eased and
walked off.

WILDWOOD SECRET came in at the start, stalked the pace to the turn, assumed command, drew clear and held under urging. Z U SOON came in at the
start, was never far off the pace, swung wide entering the stretch and closed well. TIME HEIST was crowded at the start, raced in the back, found his best
stride late, was gaining ground and earned show. GOOD ONE was crowded at the start, swung wide leaving the turn and finished well. PUBLIC SAFETY
broke slowly, saved ground, got through along the rail on the turn and lacked the needed rally. TOUCHOFCHILIPEPPER was crowded at the start, raced
mid pack in an even effort and failed to menace. THE LAST FACT showed good early speed while racing along the inside, fell back into the turn and
finished evenly. BOURBON TEDDY broke out, set the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. RED LABEL raced close to the pace, bid
and came up empty.

Footnotes
SAMARITA broke in and bumped at the start, was never far off the pace, closed steadily and wore down her rivals to get up in the final strides. PRINCESS
STELLA (IRE) pressed the pace, fell back on the turn, came again, led late and was caught. LONG TALL WOMAN angled out turn, swung wide entering the
stretch, closed willingly and was gaining fast late. FIRST KITTEN raced close to the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail, went willingly to the wire and
didn't have enough late. GO STORMIN GIRL raced mid pack, closed through traffic in a steady effort and failed to menace. PLAY TWENTY set the pace to
deep stretch and was unable to sustain her bid. SEAWARD bumped and was squeezed at the start, raced in the back and closed well late. MEDWAY
QUEEN broke out and bumped at the start and failed to threaten in an even effort. AWESOME SUNDAY showed speed to the turn, fell back and faded.

OEUVRE broke out, pressed the pace inside, was in tight along the rail into the turn, was taken back, angled out, bid five wide, closed steadily and wore
down her rivals under steady urging and got up late. SHARP HERO pressed the pace three wide, challenged for the lead into the stretch, assumed
command, led to deep stretch and was outfinished in a game effort. OFF RAMP trailed while never far back, raced outside, bid six wide entering the stretch
and closed to earn show. QUEENS UP set a pressured pace, inched clear on the turn, responded to duel, came up empty late and lost position.
CHEETARA (CHI) stalked the pace along the inside, fell back into the turn and lacked the needed late rally. CHARLIE'S PENNY broke out, raced close to
the pace early, fell back and went evenly late.

Footnotes
CONGRATS ON FIFTY sprinted clear, led throughout and held safely while kept to task. A P BLAZING GREEN chased the pace, couldn't gain on the
winner and just lasted for place. ICE SHARD was slow early, raced inside, closed under strong urging, drifted out late and was outnodded for second. FAST
FORWARD bumped at the start, raced inside and lacked a bid. FULLY CHARGED lagged early, swung wide entering the stretch improved position. PLAY
THE BLUES bumped at the start, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. DARK SOLUTION broke out and bumped at the start, showed brief speed
between horses and gave way. ARTIE AND JESSIE bumped at the start and was outrun. PIRATE MARMALADE was reluctant to load, trailed the field, was
eased and walked off.
