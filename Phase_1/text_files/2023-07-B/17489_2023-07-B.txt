Footnotes
CRUZ IN THE CASTLE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, dug in to the challenge of Grace's Secret approaching the three eighths pole, cleared
that one midway on the far turn and was steadily handled to hold on well. BONNIE BLUETOOTH veered out at the break then stalked from the three path,
bid passing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and dueled for second mid-stretch, though, showed little more. SAX settled off
the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and came along for third later yards. GRACE'S SECRET
stalked two deep, challenged approaching the three eighths pole but dropped back off the rail midway on the far turn and flattened stride the final sixteenth.
PRACTICALLY THERE veered out leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far
turn and weakened in the lane. MAE SAI PRINCESS raced off the rail on the first turn then faded through the backstretch. SHEMADEMELUCKY ran off at
least three quarters of a mile in the post parade then refused to break. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DIVINE FASHION was bumped leaving the gate and saved ground racing well back from early contention, started her bid past the half mile pole and
steadily improved from that point, rounded the far turn about the four path then dug in from the head of the lane and got up the final yards. BETCHA BY
GOLLY veered out and made contact with Divine Fashion leaving the gate then settled off the pace in the three path, picked up the chase approaching the
three eighths pole, took aim in the three path on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and took second the final strides while outfinished for the win. EXTRA
CRUNCHY stalked off the rail the first turn, challenged approaching the three eighths pole and took the nod past the five sixteenths, drew clear off the rail
midway on the far turn, was steadily encouraged leaving the turn but gave up the lead in late stretch, then nipped from second in the final strides. HIDDEN
IDENTITY was shuffled back leaving the gate then saved ground, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and
showed little more. SISTER'S DUTY took over approaching the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing
the three eighths pole, was met past the five sixteenths, dropped back midway on the far turn and weakened. HOLY DELITE rounded the first turn in the

Footnotes
THE ILLUSIONIST was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn, eased to the four path approaching the head of the lane,
dueled for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and drew clear the final yards. FROGGY THE GREMLIN pressured the pace and took the lead two deep
approaching the eighth pole but was met inside the sixteenth and relented the final yards. ATLANTIC VAQUERO chased toward the inside, raced close off
the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and ran evenly in the lane. REATA'S CASTLE lacked speed down the backstretch, rounded the turn in the
four and five paths, left the turn outside and passed rivals under his own initiative. NOW HOOK'EM ducked in leaving the gate and made contact with The
Illusionist, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. TRAPPE THE GOLD gave chase outside,
rounded the turn about the six path and showed little in the lane. BIGZ'S CABANA BOY came away awkwardly but rushed up for the lead leaving the chute
and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn, was met toward the head of the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
WEST COAST WILDCAT took over at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on
the far turn and was steadily encouraged to hold on. NINETY PROOF rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and raced
in the three path on the far turn, dueled through the stretch for second and was gaining on the waning winner. COWGIRL HOP settled in the three path the
first turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole, entered the far turn at the rail but angled to the five path approaching the top of the stretch, dug in to
take third the final strides and was gaining on the top two. HERECOMES SCARLETT saved ground close to the early pace, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened late stretch. MY BEST GIRL rated close in the three path the first turn, gave chase nearing the
three eighths pole but faded in the three path on the far turn. MORE TAJ raced well off the pace in the three path on the first turn then saved ground on the
far turn. UNBRIDLED IRISH had a brief early lead then stalked two deep on the opening turn, though, faded through the backstretch.

SENECA ROCKS settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod two deep midway on the far turn, raced clear
into the lane and was steadily handled to widen the final sixteenth. ROCK ROSE rated a short lead inside, kept the edge over the challenge of
Mygidgetmarie leaving the half mile pole, cleared that one toward the three eighths and came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, but was met at
the rail midway on the far turn, dropped back a length into the lane and settled for second best. TIMEISGOLDEN settled in the three path the first turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn five wide and came along for third mid-stretch. CRICKET WEST settled off the rail on the first
turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. FLAT DISCOUNT saved
ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. DALLAS rounded the opening turn
about the three path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but showed little response. MYGIDGETMARIE rated close two deep then challenged

GREAT SPIRIT stalked off the rail then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, took the nod two deep at the quarter, inched clear approaching the
head of the land and was steadily handled to hold on well. LUCKY BLONDE saved ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the three
eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then angled out into the lane and dueled through the final sixteenth for second. JUBA'S PARADE was a bit
reluctant to load and raced in the three path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then outfinished
for second inside the sixteenth pole. BARBERS POINT rated just off the early pace inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn at the
rail, then flattened in the lane. LIGHTNIN RUNNER took a quick lead and rated the early pace inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths
pole, was met at the quarter, dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. MUSIC LASS veered outward and made contact with
SPARKLEINYOUREYE leaving the gate then settled two deep on the opening turn, picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened nearing the far turn. The latter was bumped outward and into KEEP ON SPURRIN leaving the gate, raced off the rail on the first turn and showed
little response through the backstretch. KEEP ON SPURRIN was bumped off stride leaving the gate and settled in the four path the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
SULTRY SALLY H came away awkwardly and made contact with Spunky Zoey then settled off the rail on the first turn, started a bid approaching the three
eighths pole, took the lead toward the five sixteenths, drew away at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the stretch. TESTED POSITIVE settled off
the rail on the first turn, started her bid leaving the turn and steadily improved through the backstretch, raced in the five path on the far turn then dug in to
take second later yards. SWEET FACTOR raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase into the backstretch, raced in the three path entering
the far turn, left the turn at the rail and relented second later yards. SPUNKY ZOEY was bumped leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn and bid
toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. PRETTY SPECTACULAR rounded the
opening turn about the five path, picked up the chase past the half mile pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and passed rivals outside. BROADWAY
PEGGY raced off the early pace inside, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. CURLIN'S
DOVE surged to a clear early lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths but was met toward the
five sixteenths and weakened on the far turn. TWIN CAUSE saved ground and showed little response through the backstretch.
