Footnotes
ROLLIN BLACKOUT saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path
coming around the second turn and pulled clear in the stretch. DEAR BEAU (IRE) bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, saved ground early,
stalked the leader from off the pace coming up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the far bend and kept on to the wire. MIZ CALI
hit the gate and bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, recovered to lead the way while saving ground around the first turn, opened up coming
up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the far bend and weakened in the final furlong. ROYAL LAUGHTER hopped up and bumped with the horse
to her inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first bend, settled off the pace up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and
made no bid. WILLOWMYGIRL bumped with the horse to her outside a the start, trailed the field on the rail through the opening half mile, continued to save
ground around the far turn and was not a factor.
