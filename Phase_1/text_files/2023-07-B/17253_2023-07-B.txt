FERRARI RED broke in and raced near the back to the turn then moved up from two wide on the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch to run
down the leader and cleared late. SHUDDER sprinted to a clear lead to the top of the stretch and was caught at the eighth pole and fought gamely to be
second best. WHAT THE HEY hustled along to prompt the pace to mid stretch and weakened. BIG MOONIE ducked in at the start then raced at the back to
the turn and checked slightly nearing the three furlong marker but was never a threat. CHASING THE KING broke well, was off the pace to the turn and
retreated.

NORTHERN QUEST raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground around the turn then slipped through at the top of the stretch and engaged the
leader and dug in in the final sixteenth to prevail. THREE BALL chased the top two around the turn then moved out to three wide and engaged the leader at
the top of the stretch but was outfinished. MOST AMUSING co-led from the inside to the seven sixteenths pole then edged away but was collared at the top
of the stretch and fought gamely from between rivals to the final yard to give way grudgingly. JIMBO'S BIZ raced in the middle of the pack to the top of the
stretch then moved out to four wide and faltered. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was always back. HOT ARTIE co-led from the two path to the seven sixteenths,
kept on to the top of the stretch but gave way.

DAHLIA'S DANCER sprinted away to a clear lead and was kept to task in the stretch. HIGH GUNNER tracked the leaders down the backstretch then made
a three wide bid on the turn but was no match for the winner. AMY D prompted the pace from the two path to the quarter pole and weakened. ANGIE'S
REVRAC raced five wide through the turn then made a mid track rally. TEQUILA RITA was last away, moved up through the turn from two or three wide and
moved out to five wide at the eighth pole and flattened out. LUNA ROSE chased the leaders to the top of the stretch and gave way. POPS GIRL ALEXA
raced in the middle of the pack from the inside but was not a factor. EXPECT THE BOSS raced in the middle of the pack but was not a threat. SHASTAWIN
had good early speed then slowly retreated and jogged in.

FRISCO KID was off the pace on the inside then cut the corner into the stretch and took command at the eighth pole and drew off. CASH EXPRESS raced
in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, moved up from five wide around the turn and into the stretch but was not enough but proved second best.
FRIENDLY FOE had good early speed to press the pace to the eighth pole and fought gamely to deep stretch and gave way grudgingly. ABRIERWIN
rushed up to take the lead but was collared at the three sixteenths pole and weakened. SHADYFIED trailed the field through the turn then made a late
stretch rally to improve position. BULL RING saved ground but was not a factor. CAPTAIN COMEBACK raced in the middle of the pack but failed to
menace. CHICKEN N BISCUIT was close up on the pace to the top of the stretch but never made a bid.
