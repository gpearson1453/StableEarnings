GALACTIC EMPIRE was allowed to settle in opening stages and rated well off the top trio up the backstretch, ranged up into contention late on the far turn,
took over the lead in upper stretch and drew off under a mild drive. GINGER RULES was unhurried through early stages, came under a ride around the far
turn, hustled along three wide into the stretch and got up for place. COLE SPUR was reserved and raced in the back, swung four wide into the lane, gained
closer contention then got edged for place. SKYLINE stalked the pace up the backstretch, chased two wide around the turn, raced near the inside in upper
stretch and faded. REVENIR hustled up to the lead entering the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held clear around the far turn, got collared by
the eventual winner in upper stretch and tired in the drive. B MAKER was forwardly placed up the backstretch, weakened around the far turn and continued
to tore in the drive.

GOLDEN LUNA vied for the early lead with SWAGGY GEORGE then shook free leaving the backstretch, held clear around the turn, saved ground entering
the lane, widened advantage and kept to task under steady urging. LUCKY DUDE tracked three to four wide in contention up the backstretch, hustled along
three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and got up late for place. ABUNDANT tracked the pace along the inside, tipped two wide for the
drive, ran on and got edged late for place. SWAGGY GEORGE vied for the lead with the eventual winner up the backstretch, could not match strides
entering the turn but remained in contention, hustled along two wide into the lane and steadily weakened. SISAWAY NOW was unhurried, raced off the
pace, chased two wide around the turn and failed to move into contention. SMOOTH SCAT lacked speed, race in the back, saved ground and never
menaced.

Footnotes
JAVISTHA tracked the top flight up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide around the turn, swung four wide into the stretch run, accelerated through
the lane and got up in final stride. RELIANT was forwardly placed through early stages, given cue three wide entering the lane, advanced to duel for the
lead, shook free in late stages then got caught by stablemate in final strides. GP'S AMAZING GRACE raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the
lane, gathered momentum under a drive and finished strongly. PEACH STREET vied for the lead up the backstretch, shook free and led the way around the
turn, took on challengers from both sides in upper stretch, battled on gamely then came up empty late. STAY FABULOUS vied for the lead in the opening
quarter, edged back and chased around the turn, cut the corner and moved back up to challenge for the lead at the head of the lane, vied into the final
furlong then came up tired. HENNY'S CHICK was off slow at the start, raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
FIREBAUGH rated outside just off the top compact flight, was ridden three to four wide around the turn, sustained four wide bid into the lane, steadily edged
up closer then dug in determinedly and got up late. CLIMB TO GLORY set a pressured pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, swung two wide
into the lane, held clear past the furlong marker then got overtaken nearing the wire. FARRAH FOWLER was forwardly placed up the backstretch and
around the turn, sustained a two to three wide bid in the lane and prevailed for a share. GOOD N LUCKY chased in contention along the inside, cut the
corner entering the lane, sustained bid past the furlong marker then flattened out. HAPPY STROLL chased between rivals in early stages, swung four wide
for the drive and lacked the needed response for impact. LAZY N LUCKY raced in the back, swung wide into the lane and never threatened. KYLIES HOPE
raced up close through the backstretch, weakened around the turn and continued to tire in the drive. GOOD TIME GIRL showed response in early stages
then steadily retreated.
