Footnotes
K J'S LEGACY off to an alert start, raced on a short lead while in the two path , continued in the two path when clearing into the lane, drifted from the two to
the six path to inside the eighth pole, straightened under right-handed urging then was drifting out late. NEOKING raced in the two path through the turn
while between rivals, continued between into the lane, moved closest to the winner outside the eighth pole then chased the winner home while well clear of
the next rival. CAN'T SAY ELLY MAE pressed the pace while two wide through the turn, asked for more into the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole
while saving the show spot. YOLO SANTIAGO stalked the pace along the inside through the turn and into the lane, had aim on the top ones into the lane
and weakened. BLAZEN JUSTICE was three wide through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a response.
EVEN MONEY never a factor while along the inside. JAHEZ was in the three path through the turn and tired through the lane.

Footnotes
MINTCHOCOLATECHIP chased the pacesetter from the three path into the far turn, was asked for more in late turn, came two wide into the lane, hooked
up with the leader outside the eighth pole, inched to the front and kept the next at bay. REVS RUN set the pace on a clear lead, continued clear into the far
turn, was put under pressure through late turn, dueled with the winner through the final eighth and just was denied in a game effort. MISS LUV SHACK
raced in the four path through the turn and into the lane, bid from the five or six path, loomed a serious threat once straightened in the lane then weakened
late. BOTOX KATIE chased the pace from the two path down the backstretch, continued to chase the pace through the turn, lost contact with the top ones
into the lane, shifted into the four path and weakened late. NO MORE FAKE NEWS was five wide through the first turn, raced in the three path through the
far turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path and lacked a closing response. FASHION DIVA reared then lunged at the start, trailed
throughout. A STEWARD'S INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE FOUND THAT FASHION DIVA CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE
START.

Footnotes
TIMELESS ROSE saved ground when never far back, cut the corner into the lane, got through along the rail approaching the sixteenth pole then inched up
to prevail. TASWEYA set the pace while along the inside through the turn and under pressure, shook clear into the lane while coming off the rail, dueled with
the inside rival through the final sixteenth and could not hold her off in a game effort. COVENANT LADY pressed the pace while two wide through the far
turn, bid into the lane from the four path, had aim with an eighth to go and needed more. BUMBLE OF LOVE saved ground into the lane and offered a mild
gain while never a serious threat. HERMANA raced in the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and lacked a closing
bid. TAP DANCING LADY never a factor while in the two path through the turns. QUERIDINHA LECA in the two or three path through the far turn, came
further off the rail into the lane and never made an impact. FROZEN SOLID chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, was asked for more in the
late turn while three wide, came into the lane as a contender and was empty after straightening.
