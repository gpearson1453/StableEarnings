GRUNDER saved ground around the first turn, led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far bend and dueled
gamely to the wire to just get the win. TIGER HUNTER raced in the three path early, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from
the two path coming around the turn and dueled gamely to the finish to just miss. DA GHOST saved ground around the firs turn, settled off the pace on the
inside up the backstretch, began to move up from the rail coming around the second bend and improved position mildly from there. PASSTHECAT trailed
the field from the three path through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the two path and showed no kick. WEST BAY raced in the three path
around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back coming around the far bend and faded in the lane. CALICO JOE
raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty from there.
