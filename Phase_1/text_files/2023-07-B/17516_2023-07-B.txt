Footnotes
OCEAN KISS briefly vied for the lead, settled off of the leaders, raced in the three path, stalked down the back side, inched into the four path and launched
a bid at the three eighths pole, was given the cue and responded well by forging to the front, drew beside the front runner, drifted out and raced in the four
path down the stretch, battled with a foe who was on the rail, was still slugging it out for the lead at the sixteenth pole, OCEAN KISS angled back towards
the fence and finally switched leads, as he pushed past his rival and took the lead and the win. VERO CAMPIONE vied for the lead, took the rail, set the
fractions, was in control and racing on the rail in the stretch, was challenged by a closing rival, battled down the stretch but just missed late. VALID EARLY
was off a tad bit slow, raced in the four path, found his stride by the half mile pole, edged out and circled the field through the turn, was kept on point and
was able to getup for third. TRIPLE raced off of the pace, traveled in the four path, shifted out at the quarter pole and closed with a mild bid. ZAPAWAY vied
for the lead, stalked the pace setters in the three path, raced in between horses ,angled into the four path and tired in the stretch. ALPHIN vied for the lead,
matched strides with another foe and led in company, raced in the two path, faltered. SOMMELIER was off slow and heavily encouraged out of the gates,

Footnotes
CRYSTAL CRESCENT raced in the three path and took control of the race early, set the pace as he rated in hands, launched a bid at the three eighths
pole, was asked and responded well, drew off at the quarter pole and was hand ridden in the lane for the easy win. PREACH IT GIRL stalked the early
leader from the five path, advanced down the back side joining the leaders at the half mile pole, stayed on through the turn and into the stretch, could not
stay with the winner but chased down the stretch securing second place honors. PAT HAND GIRL stalked the leader from the three path, raced in between
foes, pushed forward at the three eighths pole was well placed in the stretch but had no late kick. WAIT ON ME stalked the leader from the six path, moved
up and joined the leaders at the half mile pole on the outside, continued on through the turn, but had no late rally. SODDY DAISY vied for the lead, raced on
the rail, set the pace, saved ground throughout but did not have enough today. WHO DAT GREY raced from mid pack in the two path, slightly improved
position and finished even. SIMPLE SUNDAY raced off of the pace in the three path, made no impact. QUALITY BOW raced mid pack in the five path,
launched a bid at the half mile pole, but to no avail. GUEST IN MY HEART was off a tad slow, raced on the rail, but showed little.

Footnotes
MINT took advantage of the one post position, used his natural speed to take the lead, stayed on the rail through out the race, set moderate fractions as he
maintained about a length in front of the rest of the field, comfortably lead into the stretch, had the wire in his sites and finished as the uncontested winner.
PHARAOH'S PROPHECY raced in the five path in the middle of the field, improved position late gaining on the outside getting up for second. EGO was off
in the middle of the pack, raced in the two path, was patient down the back side, launched a bid a the three eights pole, stayed on the rail through the turn
and down the stretch, moved into a three way battle for second as he raced up the rail. LIARS CLUB stalked the leaders, was racing on the rail, had to
steady in the first turn, raced even after that. VINYL raced in the four path, stalked the pace, raced in between foes, stayed on point battled late, finished
best of the rest. LOVING LUCKY stalked the leader from the three path, was joined by foes and raced between hoses, stayed in the second flight down the
stretch, briefly battled, then faltered. SENATOR CON raced from off of the pace in the three path, slightly improved position, maintained through out and
raced even. MOUNT KENYA was off a bit slow, was last, made no impact. STEAL IT BACK was of a bit slow, raced on the rail, was in contact with the field
in the turn, shifted out five wide in the turn and raced flat. TEMPRANO brief speed, stopped.

SHE A HOT MESS settled in hands off of the pace while racing in the three path, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, shifted into the four path in the
upper stretch, took control by the three sixteenth pole and drew off from there. HAMAZING DEBATE stalked the pace from the three path, raced in between
horses and tucked behind the leaders, lost ground in the turn, was heavily encouraged with a right handed crop near the eighth pole, sent as clear message
and responded well finding another gear and closing well for second. PROUD VICTORIA was sharp out of the gate, stumbled while establishing an early
position, inched over to the rail, stalked the pace, was joined by another foe and matched strides with that one through the turn and into the stretch, was
asked at the eight pole and responded well with a late surge getting up for third. REDEFINITION vied for the lead, briefly led, raced on the rail, stalked the
pace saved ground through out, but ran even down the lane. ABBY THE BULL DAWG was off slow and last for the first few calls, saved ground and put in a
mild bid late. GETONOUTTAHERE vied for the lead, raced on the rail, settled into a stalking position and tired. LEGENDARY GIFT trailed through out.
