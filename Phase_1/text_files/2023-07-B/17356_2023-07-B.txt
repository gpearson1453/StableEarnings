Footnotes
ORCZY (IRE) saved ground while being allowed to settle, moved forward nearing the turn, angled out to come two-wide entering the stretch, caught
ANNA'S IRON MAN nearing the eighth pole and bested that one in a stiff drive. ANNA'S IRON MAN saved ground setting the pace, responded when
challenged and just failed to last in a game effort. THIRSTY KISS was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. PROUD LION
prompted the pace from the outset, came three-wide into the stretch and weakened. MAMACALLMEBOO broke out to get away slightly behind the field,
then was reserved off the pace, moved up three-wide on the backstretch to reach conentention, was forwardly placed from there to the stretch and tired.

PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE was unhurried early, rallied two-wide into the stretch, angled out slightly nearing the eighth pole for room and was up in the final
sixteenth to win going away. THE THIRD RING vied with SILENT DECLARATION from along the outside, responded when asked, couldn't quite resist the
winner late but held on gamely for the place. SILENT DECLARATION vied for the lead from along the inside and held on well in a determined try. OXBOW
PARK stalked the pace from along the inside, angled out three-wide nearing the quarter pole to launch his bid but lacked the needed late response.

FREIGHTLINE prompted KNIGHTLINE while racing two-wide, moved up to take the lead from the one nearing the eighth pole and edged clear late.
KNIGHTLINE saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed and held on gamely for the place. JOKERS FOUR was forwardly placed while racing
three-wide, could not reach the top two but finished well in a steady effort. MINER LEAGUE saved ground while being reserved off the pace, angled out for
the drive but lacked a rally. GOLDEN AFFAIR was unhurried after breaking a step slow, came four-wide into the stretch but failed to seriously threaten.
BOSSYBYNATURE saved ground while being allowed to settle but was not a factor. CALORESE hesitated and then hopped at the start to get away well
behind the field and was unable to recover the lost ground. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE
FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

OWHATARUSH saved ground setting the pace, drifted out slightly at the three-sixteenths pole and maintained a safe advantage. ITS KRAKEN TIME
prompted the pace from along the outside, came tree-wide into the stretch, could not quite reach the winner but finished well for second in a steady effort.
DIVERSIFUL was bumped at the start by A SKIP IN THE PARK, then saved ground while being reserved off the pace, slipped through during the drive and
finished in a mild rally. A SKIP IN THE PARK broke in to bump with DIVERSIFUL, then was unhurried early, rallied two-wide into the stretch and then went
evenly late. TIGER TOO was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide and weakened. BRANNIGAN settled in stride early, came three-wide into the
stretch but failed to threaten.

NAN ELIZABETH saved ground while being reserved off the pace, slipped through entering the stretch, angled out nearing the eighth pole and was up in
the final sixteenth to win going away. CLASSIC LEAH dueled for the lead from along the inside with PEARL RIVER DELTA and HEART ON THE RUN,
shook those two off entering the stretch to open a clear lead but was unable to resist the winner late in a game try. GOLD COAST GIRL was allowed to
settle early, came three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. YOUR ROYAL COIL hesitated at the start to get away well behind her field, rallied
six-wide into the stretch, offered a bid leaving the eighth pole and hung. PEARL RIVER DELTA dueled for the lead from between horses to the stretch and
weakened. HEART ON THE RUN disputed the pace to the stretch while three-wide and tired.

ASIAN RAIN broke in to bump with BOB'S SNIPER, then opened a clear lead early angling over to the rail, saved ground setting pace, responded when
challenged by WARFRONT FIGHTER nearing the quarter pole to open a clear lead entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage under strong
handling. WARFRONT FIGHTER prompted the pace while racing two-wide, ranged up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole, then dropped back slightly
entering the stretch before responding to be gaining again on the winner late. MISO FAST dropped back early, then rallied eight-wide into the stretch and
finished full of run. MOJAVE saved ground while being close up early and finished in a mild rally. BOB'S SNIPER was bumped from both sides at the start,
then was unhurried early, came seven-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. LOCHNESS was two-wide while racing in the middle of the pack
and went evenly. FAMOUS ROCK STAR was forwardly placed to the stretch while three-wide and tired. DECIMATE broke out to bump with BOB'S
SNIPER, then was prominently placed early while racing four-wide but lacked a rally.
