REAL FAST saved ground through the turn and into the lane, shifted into the three path just inside the eighth pole, was under hand encouragement when
reeling in the winner and extended the margin to the wire. HILTON HEAD set the pace on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, had his largest
advantage with an eighth to then was no match for the winner inside the sixteenth pole but stayed on to be well clear for the place spot. WASHINGTON'S
UNION stalked the pace from the three path into the lane, was in the four or five path when straightened and lacked a closing response. THE MOTTO
chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, bid into the lane three wide and tired through the final eighth. BUGSY BREEZE was outrun while
near the rail.

BAYOU CHROME raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path with aim on the leader then reeled that one in at the wire.
GHOST BIKE set the pace on a clear lead through the far turn and into the lane, was still well clear with an eighth to go, was all out late and was caught at
the wire. MY FAVORITE UNCLE was in the two path and between rivals into the turn, bid into the lane from the five path and finished evenly. COSMIC
STARDUST was along the inside through the turns when in mid-pack, guided to the six path for the drive and offered a mild gain. LOLAS BEAU saved
ground through the turns, came into the lane from the two or three path and improved position while not a threat. SOME R BLESSED chased the pace from
along the inside through the far turn and faded through the lane. TOTALITARIAN was three wide through the first turn, chased the pace from the three path
down the backstretch and into the turn, was still a contender in late turn then was empty after entering the lane. ZEN JOURNEY was getting out into the first
turn, raced in the six to the five path through the first, continued in the four to the three path into the far turn and was done entering the lane.

Footnotes
CHESS MASTER chased the pace through mid-turn while in the three path, bid three wide into the lane, caught the leader approaching the sixteenth pole
and dove clear. SHIMMER ME TIMBERS raced along the inside through the turn, shifted to the four or five path after entering the lane and finished with
good energy to be second best. SMOKIN RICHIE set the pace along the inside through the turn when under pressure, shook off one challenger into the lane
then gave way late. SOARING BIRD was bothered at the start when another took his path, raced in the three path through the turn when near the back,
straightened in the lane from the six or seven path and was gaining late. TRIPLE ELVIS was bumped at the start, raced along the inside through the turn,
was in the three path in the lane and lacked a bid. STORM DADDY never a threat while in the two path through the turn and finishing in the six path.
NEVER HAVE I EVER (IRE) pressed the pace two wide through the turn and into the lane then faltered after straightening. TRIPULANTE was always in the
back while near the inside.

Footnotes
RIVER REDEMPTION was unhurried while in the two path, moved closer through the turn, shifted into the four path for the drive, caught the leader
approaching the sixteenth pole and drove past. RACE CRAFT chased the pace from the two or three path into the turn, bid three wide in late turn and into
the lane, gained the lead inside the eighth pole then was no match for the winner while staying on to save the place spot. MAJOR SPARKS trailed while
near the rail through the far turn, was guided into the seven path into the lane and rallied belatedly from mid-track. EPIMYTHIUM saved ground throughout,
cut the corner into the lane, bid near the eighth pole then weakened late. MAJOR WAGER set the pace along the inside into the lane then gave way once
headed. FIREWATER JAKE pressed the pace two wide through the far turn then faded through the lane. CASANOVA KITTEN raced four wide through the
first turn, continued in the four path into the far turn, was asked for more in mid-turn and was empty entering the lane.

at the half-mile pole to challenge for the lead, then was no match. SKIPPINJUSTICE raced inside, angled four wide at the three-sixteenths pole, then rallied
late for the show spot. WILDCATJUSTICE improved his position late in the four path. AMERICA RULES stalked the pace inside, moved to the three path in
the stretch, then faded. CLEVER KATE saved ground. AMAZINGNESS raced in the two path and faded. LIEUTENANT KITTY was bumped at the start,
then passed tired ones. NOBLE PRIZE was not a factor. CHINATOWN NANCY was bumped at the start, stalked the early pace in the three path, then gave
way in the stretch. SWIFT TEMPLE stalked the pace in the four path for a half mile and then gave way.
