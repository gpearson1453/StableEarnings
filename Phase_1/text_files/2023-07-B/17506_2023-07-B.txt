Footnotes
CONQUERING KING taken off pacesetter and stalked that rival from two or three path, moved up on second turn, bid nearing quarter marker, gained
control and edged away in late stages. BURTON WAY caught four wide into first turn, came in bit while tracking pace, tipped out three wide leaving last turn,
split rivals, loomed outside winner but got no closer nearing wire. FOREIGN INFLUENCE three wide and between rivals early, traveled outside runner-up on
second turn, entered the stretch four wide and was along for the show. HABEAS gained lead on clubhouse turn, controlled pace while bit off the fence,
ceded front nearing quarter marker and weakened in the drive. DONTTESTYOURLUCK settled inside, hugged the rail for the most part and lacked needed
late response. UPRIGHT two wide early, chased from the inside, remained just off the rail to the stretch and was no late threat. BENELLI caught five wide
into first bend, angled in bit, chased outside to second turn, entered the lane four wide and never menaced. HEARTBREAK KID bobbled leaving the gate,
trailed either along the rail or in the two path, came out further around the last bend and did not rally. BOOMING BERNARDO secured rail shortly after the
break, traveled inside or just off the rail thereafter and make no late impact.

Footnotes
ENDLESSLY tracked pace from the inside, waited for room behind rival in upper to mid-stretch, finally clear path and burst between TRACK AND FIELD
and MALIBU RUN, quickly moved to the front and powered away late. TRACK AND FIELD was sent up inside to grab command, dictated pace from bit off
the rail, retained cushion into the lane, overtaken passing sixteenth marker and held the place. MASTERS SUNDAY chased along the inside to the second
turn, moved up some, found traffic in upper stretch, swung out for room and closed strongly outside to grab third. MALIBU RAIN three wide early, moved up
to pressure pacesetter on the backstretch, continued prominently into the lane and bit off the rail, weakened bit late and lost third. WHO IS PAVEL traveled
two or three wide into and around the final turn, loomed outside in upper stretch but failed to sustain effort in the drive. POTENTIAL SPAM saved ground
chasing the pace, remained inside into the stretch and lacked needed late punch. KENNEL CLUB was bit rank from between rivals into and on the first turn,
settled and chased while outside winner to second bend and weakened. DETAILS MATTER hopped at the break to be off behind the field, crossed over
early, came back out and chased three or four wide into the stretch and did not threaten.

Footnotes
COLT FICTION stalked from the outside to the turn, moved up and engaged leading pack four deep, continued four abreast around the turn, gained slim
advantage after straightening away in the lane and edged away in the late stages. ESTABLISHED was part of the speed brigade while three deep into and
around the turn, continued on same path into the stretch, could not match winner in the drive but gamely lasted for second. CYBERVIKING stalked leading
pack from the inside, tipped out three wide exiting the turn, closed in the final sixteenth and just missed second while outside runner-up. BALADI settled off
the pace and outside rival, traveled three wide into the bend then four wide entering the stretch and went willingly to the wire. ROOKIE MISTAKE dueled
from between rivals and on two path into and around the turn, dropped back slightly past midstretch and weakened further in the late stages. MISTER BOLD
was unprepared when the gate opened to be off behind the field, chased on two path most of the way and never menaced. JAMMING EDDY went up along
the rail to force pace, remained glued to the fence into and around the turn pressuring the leaders, continued inside and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
SLAM DIEGO tracked leaders early from off the rail, waited briefly on the turn behind foes, roused and bid three deep into the lane, gained command past
eighth marker and powered away. ROSY EDGE was bit squeezed at the start, three deep early, continued outside and four wide leaving the turn then
outfinished inside rivals for the place. TENACIOUS LADY stalked then moved up to pressured the leaders from along the rail, dropped back slightly around
the turn, re-rallied inside into the stretch, challenged inside, dueled to mid-stretch, lost contact with winner and was outfinished for the place. MAJOR
PRYCE chased inside winner down the backstretch, remained in two path early on the turn, angled four wide entering the stretch but was no late threat.
PACIFIC ZIP forced the early pace from the outside, grabbed advantage approaching the quarter marker, edged away, came two wide into the lane, dueled
between foes in upper stretch then weakened. POINT AND SHOOT reserved from the inside, saved ground chasing the pace and weakened. LOVE OUR
FAMILY dueled between foes early then inside PACIFIC ZIP, gained slim advantage early on the turn, dropped back later around the bend and gave way in
the lane.

routed and burst to the front in deep stretch. RIVETING SPIRIT saved ground chasing the pace, continued inside into the stretch, angled out through the
drive, found her best stride late in final sixteenth, closed strongly and was up in final stride for second. ISSA COURT stalked from the inside, moved up
around final turn, awaited room inside pacesetter in upper stretch, finally squeezed through inside that rival later in the drive, rallied strongly and just missed
the place. CRIMSON ROSE stepped to the front, controlled pace into backstretch, was joined by rivals in middle stages then regained command, gave out
slightly in the drive and lost placing late. OCTANE (BRZ) settled inside early, saved ground chasing pace, came out, went three then four wide around last
turn and into the stretch, came out further in the drive and closed strongly from the outside. DOLLY MAY (IRE) reserved early then secured the rail, came
back off the fence chasing the pace, was two wide entering the stretch then in bit tight nearing sixteenth marker in the drive. QUARIA THUNDER forced the
pace into the backstretch, briefly moved up to challenged in middle stages then pressed the pace into and on the last turn, came two wide into the lane,
between rivals in the drive and weakened late. LA VIKINA stalked early on the two path, continued two wide to last turn, tipped out three wide into the
stretch and also weakened. QUIET SECRETARY chased bit off rail and outside eventual winner on the backstretch, traveled two then three wide around
last bend and to the stretch and lacked needed response. SHVERE ARBETER three wide around first turn, continued outside, briefly joined leaders on the
backstretch, remained prominent outside to final turn, dropped back around that bend then was eased in the stretch and walked off.

TROPICANA GIRL made steady progress three wide into and around the turn, reached the front exiting the turn then kicked cleared through the drive and
safely held. ROMAN EMPRESS between rivals early and on two path, got shuffled back at the seven-sixteenths pole, angled six wide around the turn while
advancing some, came out further in upper stretch, closed boldly from the outside and proved second best. WRONG TURN CUPID forced the early issue
outside pacesetter, gained slim advantage passing quarter marker, was overtaken by winner entering the stretch, continued bit off the rail and lasted for the
show. SHOUT IT OUT between rivals early, moved up bit four wide on the turn, came out further into the stretch and lost the show late. FLAT OUT JOY
chased along the rail into and around the turn, came out slightly through the stretch and finished with interest. COWBOYS DAUGHTER bobbled at the

two wide, angled four wide around the turn and lacked needed late response. GET'EM TIGER bobbled at the start, settled into stride and stalked pace three
deep on the backstretch, continued three wide on the turn, coaxed along most of the turn, asked right handed heading into the lane, asked again left handed
in upper stretch, ridden along until the final sixteenth and rider wrapped up after making no headway. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN off a half length slow, suffered
a mild shuffle, climbed a bit early, settled well off the rail on the backstretch, continued to be kept wide on the turn, outmoved by ROMAN EMPRESS
heading into the lane, asked and failed to improve. DRIZELLA asked for speed out of the gate, attempted to contest the lead along the inside, had to settle
for a chasing inside position, prompted mid turn to keep up, asked right handed twice in upper stretch and failed to keep on. CROWN KITTEN away well,
settled for stalking rail position early, nibbled at by the rider to advance along the rail, did so and in striking range entering the turn, continued well placed
through the turn, eased out into the two path, asked and failed to respond while falling back and weakening. ISLAND LIFE away well, contested the early
pace in between rivals, assumed command and went to railed heading into the turn, continued to lead most of the turn, failed to keep up with WRONG

in the drive and finally wore down leader in final strides. BARBARA T was sent up from along the rail to grab lead, edged away around the bend and well
into the stretch, dug in late from the inside but could not stave off the winner. GATE TO PARADISE tracked leaders from along the rail, remained on that
path around the turn and through the stretch and got up late for minor award. THERMAL showed good early foot, led early then forced the pace outside
runner-up, continued prominently into the stretch but weakened in the drive. JUST BE YOU broke out, kept wide and stalked pace four to five wide heading
into the turn, continued widest through the turn, asked left handed in upper stretch and kept to task to the wire. WE'LL DO IT LIVE away cleanly, sent in
between rivals on the backstretch, continued to contest pace into the turn, began to lose ground midway through the turn and weakened into the lane.
ELEVEN OUT OF TEN lagged back early, trailed while bit off the rail and only passed tiring rivals. INTO YELLOWSTONE off slow, settled off the pace and
off the rail going into the turn, was three to four wide on the turn and failed to respond in the lane. WHISKEY WILD away cleanly, lacked room and suffered

outside leader, surged to the front and kicked clear. BREAKFAST RIDE forced the early pace three wide, bid on the final turn on same path, gained front
into the stretch, inched away but was overtaken past eighth marker and held for second. MCLAREN VALE checked off heels into initial turn, remained three
wide into and around the final turn, and went evenly through the drive. PIROLI stumbled leaving the gate, settled inside, saved ground to far turn, angled
out, was four wide around last bend then five wide into the stretch and gained minor award. DIVINE ARMOR between rivals into backstretch, remained two
or three wide into the stretch and failed to menace. REDLINE chased inside, remained along he rail to the stretch, tipped out some and failed to threaten.
MBAGNICK (CHI) off bit slow, entered first turn four wide, continued wide on the backstretch, advanced three to four wide on the second turn and weakened
when asked in the lane. IT'S MY HOUSE away well, chose to sit off the pace and sit the pocket trip into the first turn, kept under tight rein through the first
turn, settled on the backstretch, entered second turn well placed inside, had to steady when shuffled by tiring DISCO BALL, in tight in the stretch and failed
to respond under right handed urging. DISCO BALL broke out, mildly asked for speed, cleared heading into the first turn, led along the inside on the
backstretch, continued to lead into the second turn, headed by BREAKFAST RIDE nearing the top of the lane, roused and had no response and tired in
upper stretch.
