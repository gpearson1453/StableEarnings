Footnotes
MIZ SENSE was away awkwardly from the outside post, went around the first turn in the four path, settled off the pace, was asked near the half-mile pole,
gained in three path on the far turn as the field began to bunch, waited behind tiring horses coming to the five-sixteenths, was roused while finding room
inside that pole, rallied in the two path into the stretch, made a bid at the three-sixteenths, shook clear coming to the furlong marker and drew away under
strong urging. CLASSY MISCHIEF was hustled from the start then urged along in the three path on the first turn, settled off the pace, gained five wide on
the far turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, led briefly in upper stretch then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no match while just able to
hold the place. BUCHU raced inside for most of the first turn then moved to the two path, settled off the pace, rallied four wide on the far turn, made a bid
outside the five-sixteenths, led past the quarter-pole then lost the advantage in upper stretch and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the
place. LIFE'S AN AUDIBLE was hustled from the gate, raced inside on the first turn, shifted out under urging entering the backstretch, tracked the leader,
made a bid in the three path early on the far turn, led briefly outside the five-sixteenths, moved to the two path then the rail while dropping back late on that
bend and tired. JUSTDENY was taken in hand while dropping from the two path to the rail on the first turn, moved closer outside the five-eighths, shifted
from the rail to the three path under urging on the final turn and faltered. CAUSEWAY'S JEWEL went to the front, showed the way in the two path, was
challenged on the far turn, lost the advantage inside the three-eighths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
OBRIGADA five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and advanced strongly on the vying trio to overhaul the
leader just prior to swinging four wide into upper stretch, came under brief and light hand urging straightened away, went clear being flashed the crop to the
right side and prevailed comfortably at the end. ICY REPLY vied from the four path with a pair down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and
began to shake off those rivals tucking briefly two wide at the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing under challenge from the top one to the outside and was
headed for the front just before spinning three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to safely secure the place honors.
DOLCE SERA got pinched out between foes just after the start, chased four then three wide before tucking inside through the turn coming under coaxing at
the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors. CHAMPAGNE POETRY vied three then two
wide between foes coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch dropping back, weakened to the finish but had
enough to best two rivals to garner the last major share in the final jumps. GRACEFUL ROSE came out just after the start pinching out DOLCE SERA in
tandem with CHAMPAGNE POETRY, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened.
CARBON coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide briefly before tipping four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper
stretch and weakened. LIBERTY FLAME broke out at the start and came under coaxing to vie from the two path inside a pair of rivals, came under coaxing
at the seven-sixteenths, got shaken off five-sixteenths from home, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

ALYS BEACH chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking narrow command a sixteenth out, came out two paths under a left handed crop with seventy yards to go to trade a bump with
LIFE TALK in the shadow of the wire and gamely held on to prevail. LIFE TALK shied in at the start and was taken hold of conceding three to four lengths to
the front before settling into stride, chased three wide down the backstretch and then went five wide through the turn advancing under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, tucked four wide at the five-sixteenths, went five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, came in under
an active left rein three paths once clear of MUGEN to look the aforementioned foe in the eye seventy yards from home, traded a bump just outside the
finish line fighting gamely but missed at the end. MUGEN broke in at the start bumping WASKESIU into PHANTASMICAL and in turn into ICE COLD,
showed the way in hand just off the inside under pressure from RINGY DINGY to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from flanking challengers and was collared a sixteenth out, ran on clear for the show honors. WASKESIU
shied in at the start then got bumped by MUGEN into PHANTASMICAL, chased along the inside in closest aim of the top pair coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung just off the inside into upper stretch, got flashed the crop to the left side while weakening in the late stages. RINGY DINGY prompted
four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ICE COLD broke out at the start, then
got bumped by PHANTASMICAL due to pressure outside begun by MUGEN and was carried into the bend of the clubhouse turn, extracted herself and
conceded three to four lengths to the front before settling to chase along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch and weakened. ALAMO broke in at the start bumping JUST MUSIC, chased five then four wide, came under coaxing briefly three wide at
the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. JUST MUSIC bumped at the start by ALAMO who broke inwards, chased five wide until
tucked two to three wide half a mile from home, then went four wide through the turn and four to five wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
PHANTASMICAL broke out at the start and was bumped by WASKESIU due to pressure from MUGEN and got knocked back inwards into ICE COLD and
then carried that foe in to the bend of the clubhouse turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for

LEFTEMBEHIND broke out at the start and then got pinched out between foes under coaxing, chased three wide into the first turn and altered out four wide
when a wall of foes in front buckled from solid bumps due to pressure from CATTANI outside seven and a half furlongs from home, chased four then five
wide and got floated out seven wide at the three-eighths when caught outside an easing up RULE BREAKER and was placed to coaxing near the
five-sixteenths, angled in to swing five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, then edged clear under a drive to prevail.
MUDVILLE NINE coaxed from the gate, got brushed at the seven and a half at the end of a chain of solid bumps and leans begun by CATTANI, chased
along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took over command with five-sixteenths to go and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug
in under threat and was collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to secure the place honors clear of the rest. JUST FOR LUCK coaxed from the start,
raced six then five wide through the opening dog legged turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and through the far turn under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid to the furlongs grounds, kept on to the finish. ATLANTA'S ACUNA
hustled from the gate, got bumped solidly between foes with seven and a half furlongs to run and squeezed out IMPULSIVE SPENDING and bumped
STRATEGYFORYOU sideways due to pressure outside from RULE BREAKER and CATTANI, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home and weakened. CATTANI hustled from the start, raced six paths off the inside briefly before tucking five wide and
brushing RULE BREAKER, had that rival shy in and bumped foes solidly inside down through to MUDVILLE NINE along the rail, chased two to three wide
down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the far turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, tired, and was
eased through the final furlong to the finish. STRATEGYFORYOU coaxed from the start, got bumped solidly by ATLANTA'S ACUNA in a chain of bumping
and was briefly knocked sideways before brushing MUDVILLE NINE, showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. IMPULSIVE SPENDING coaxed from
the gate, raced three wide when bumped solidly between foes and squeezed out with seven and a half furlongs to run, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and eased home to the finish. FORWARD CAST coaxed from the start,
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the wire. RULE
BREAKER hustled from the start, got brushed by CATTANI and came inwards bumping ATLANTA'S ACUNA solidly into IMPULSIVE SPENDING starting a
chain of solid bumps down through MUDVILLE NINE, chased four wide and then went six wide through the far turn getting placed to a protective hold, went
ten to eleven wide into upper stretch and was eased up before being pulled up in the stretch, then walked off under his own power. Please note due to a
technical error, the seven-eighths split was omitted pending review.

Footnotes
CHANNEL MAKER broke in and bumped with a foe then was hustled to the front, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside, responded well when
asked on the final turn, came under the crop in upper stretch and held sway under strong urging. VERSTAPPEN was rated just off the pace on the inside
under a snug hold, drafted behind the pacesetter on the final turn, shifted to the two path while asked at the quarter-pole, chased under a drive into the final
furlong then lugged in towards the rail and narrowly earned the place while unable to reach the winner. NEVER EXPLAIN went two then three wide on the
first turn, was rated outside without cover passing the grandstand for the first time, dropped in to get cover near the wire, went three wide on the second
turn, continued near the middle of the field on the backstretch, was roused four wide on the third turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and just
missed the place while clear for the show. DAUNT was rated just off the pace on the outside in the three path without the benefit of cover, came under
urging between rivals in the three path on the final turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. TAWNY PORT stalked the pace on the
outside in the two path, was asked between foes on the final turn, had REBEL'S ROMANCE clip his heels at the five-sixteenths, chased under a drive into
the final furlong and tired. HIGHEST HONORS was taken in hand early, moved from the rail to the two path on the first turn, was reserved towards the back,
went three wide on the final turn, steadied to avoid the spill at the five-sixteenths, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SOLDIER RISING
(GB) dropped from the three path to the rail while placed under tight restraint on the opening bend, was reserved well back while saving ground, bumped
very hard with REBEL'S ROMANCE after that foe clipped heels at the five-sixteenths then checked very sharply and lost all chance. THE GREY WIZARD
(IRE) was bumped at the start and forced in then taken up some, dropped well behind the rest of the field, saved ground while lagging at the rear, checked
sharply behind the spill outside the five-sixteenths, came out into upper stretch and was no factor. REBEL'S ROMANCE (IRE) was reserved off the pace
while inside to the two path, clipped heels midway through the final turn then stumbled badly and was bumped hard while losing the rider then was walked
off after being apprehended by an outrider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE SPILL ON THE FINAL TURN, THERE WAS NO CHANGE
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. SOLDIER RISING RAN FOR PURSE-MONEY ONLY

Footnotes
LITTLE PRANKSTER coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide, advanced on the front taking command five-sixteenths from home, spun three
wide into upper stretch, went clear under light urging and then finished the final sixteenth hands and heels only to prevail comfortably at the end. RISK
FREE coaxed from the start, raced along the inside just off the heels of ARRASOU under a firm hold early on, tipped two to three wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just get up for the place honors in the very last jump.
ARRASOU chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick just getting nailed in the last stride for the place honors. FRAU DIABLO showed the way in hand just
off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front just inside five-sixteenths to run, took the inside
route into upper stretch and weakened. BROOKLYN GIRLEE coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MATERIAL WITNESS broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide for home and weakened in the stretch. QUIESCENT chased along the inside and then just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. RIVIERE chased just off the inside until tucked
inside at the half mile pole, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, tired. ALLEGEDLY chased just off the inside
down the backstretch before going five then six wide through the turn, went six wide into upper stretch, made no impact.
