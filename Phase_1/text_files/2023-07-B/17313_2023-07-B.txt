Footnotes
LITTLE G T set the pace on the inside, turned back an early bid on the backstretch to draw clear on the turn and then drew off in the lane to prove much the
best while being kept to right handed crop urging. VILLAGE PREACHER was reserved two wide, three wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane
and rallied well to gain the place award. FROSTY WARRIOR was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and made a mild bid nearing the furlong
marker but needed more. LIGHTNING LAD was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. I'LLSMILEAGAIN stalked the pace
two wide and weakened in the drive. WILD IRISHMAN tracked the pace and made a early three wide bid on the backstretch but tired on the turn. SEIZE
THE BREEZE showed no speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
SWILL pressed the pace from the gate racing two wide, took control turning for home and drew clear down the lane. SWOT ANALYSIS broke alertly to set
the pace, was pressured throughout, could not match the winner in the stretch and kept on to be clearly second best. GALAXY MUSIC tracked the pace
from between horses through the turn, cleared to drop to the inside and rallied from the inside to gain the show. YOUNGEST OF FIVE settled off the early
pace, moved up three wide in the turn in an early drive and flattened out in the lane. BLACK CANDY slow early to be well back and passed a tired rival in
the stretch. SPEIGHT AND MALICE flashed brief speed to prominent to the turn and came up empty.

WHERE'S EMMA went to the lead from the gate while under strong restraint, opened a clear advantage down the backside while well rated, responded
when challenged in the turn and drew clear down the lane as much the best. NAA DUDETTE unhurried in the early going, made steady progress three wide
down the backstretch, rallied five wide coming home and was up for the place. ANNIE'S KINGDOM stalked the pace to the far turn, mounted a two wide bid
midway on the turn to draw even, could not go with the winner but finished gamely to just miss the place. KOBE'S SMILE tracked the pace from the rail to
the quarter pole, angled out turning for home and rallied mildly in the lane. RAPID MISS TAPIT caught wide in the first turn, moved to challenge four wide
into the far turn and finished evenly. IN OPEN COURT trailed the field to the head of the stretch and passed tired rivals late. THE MONSTER IRUS
prominently placed for the first half mile and gave way in the far turn. SHE GOT THE MUNNI never menaced. SHE'S LIKE THUNDER was never a factor.

Footnotes
MY BOY BLUE was well rated and two wide on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid when straightened, drew clear in the furlong
grounds to prove much the best under a mild drive. PICO D'ORO set a pressured pace on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn to shake clear by the
furlong marker but proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award late. CLASS WIZARD was off slowly spotting the field three lengths,
two to three wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and had a mild late kick to just miss the place award. STUBBORNKINDAFELLA was
settled early and saved ground on the turn but lacked the needed bid. ALPHALFA pressed the pace two wide and came three wide into the lane but was
empty in the drive.

Footnotes
TITRATE tracked the leaders down the backside, angled four wide turning for home and closed well to be clear at the wire. CALLOWAY PEAK unhurried
early in hand, made a steady gain down the backside to be in striking distance turning for home and mounted a belated rally to be gaining late. FINGAL
stalked the pace from three wide to the far turn, made a bold bid at the head of the lane to take the lead and was out-finished in the drive. ASSIDUOUSLY
(GB) crowded at the start to drop to the rear of the field, remained unhurried down the backside and made late gains in the stretch. GLOBAL SENSATION
pressed the pace to the far turn, ranged up to threaten at the quarter pole and flattened out. COPAZO well placed for the first half mile and lacked a
response when called upon into the far turn. DIGITAL SOFTWARE was never a threat. SPRITZER set a pressured pace to the far turn and tired. NO ME
DIGAS was never a serious factor.

Footnotes
ZO LEE was away alertly, pressed the pace in hand on the turn two wide, made a bid off the turn to go on even terms for command, hit the front nearing the
furlong marker and kicked clear smartly to prove best, driving. MEMORIALIZE was fractious in the gate, unprepared when the gates opened and lost iron at
the break and off eight lengths last, recovered and got foot back into the irons, advanced three wide on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn and
finished well to get the nod for the place award. VICTORY BADGE was off slowly, slow into stride, inside on the turn and advanced midway on the turn,
swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied well, outfinished for place award. MATCHING ENERGY prompted the early pace three wide, then rated off
the front runners and dropped to the inside on the turn and rated, made a inside bid leaving the turn but was in tight by the furlong marker and hung.
CORINTH set a pressured pace on the inside and then battled to the furlong marker but faded late. NO SHOW stalked the pace four wide and weakened.
LOU ANNA chased the pace on the inside and weakened. GENUINE PERIL fractious in the gate, chased the pace three wide and weakened. TALKIN'
SASSY was three to four wide on the turn and not a factor.
