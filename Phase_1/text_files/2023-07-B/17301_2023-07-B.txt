Footnotes
MONSTERONTHEMIDWAY tucked in behind the leading pair and rated off those tracking along the rail saving ground, found room inside at the top of the
stretch, took the lead racing in the two path at that juncture, drew clear under urging. ELECTRIC CHARGE was ridden along from the break but lacking
significant early speed, shifted in and saved ground through the first turn, continued along the rail through the far turn and put to a drive coming to the top of
the stretch, came out in mid-stretch, was no match for the winner but secured the place. RUSSIAN STANDARD was lightly bumped at the start, stalked the
early pace two to three wide, moved to challenge putting a nose in front at the five- and one-half, continued to press the leader through the far turn, was
carried out numerous paths coming to the top of the stretch as that rival bore out, kept on in the lane to secure show honors, pulled up on the gallop out,
was vanned off. LITTLE STEVEN went straight to the lead to set the pace from inside, was headed and challenged near the five- and one-half pole,
continued to face pressure through the far turn, bore out badly leaving that bend, came up empty. ARMAVIR shifted in early, saved ground, was asked for
more coming to the five-sixteenths, ran on without threatening. CHERRY ORCHARD bumped a rival at the start, stalked from outside a foe three to four
wide off the leading pair, was carried out eight deep by those two turning for home, ran on. MARCHING ORDERS was wrangled back in the early going
racing outside three to four wide, tired.

Footnotes
BLOW TORCH bumped the outer rival after the start, tracked from inside runners, steadied and was shuffled past the half, put to urging on the turn saving
ground, struck the lead in mid-stretch with an inside bid, drew clear. FAITHFUL RULER quickly moved clear to set the pace, raced off the rail into the turn,
drifted out through the stretch, was overtaken by mid-stretch and outkicked but held second. PLAUSIBLE DENILE bumped the outside rival then was
bumped by the inside foe at the start, raced between runners early just off the leader, shifted out on the turn coming into upper stretch four wide, ran on for
show. DASH TO THE CASH was bumped at the start, lacked early speed, saved ground on the turn, ran on mildly. TIMEHASCOME stalked from outside
going three wide on the turn, lacked needed late kick.

Footnotes
PINBALLER forced the pace, dueled outside a foe two to three wide into the turn, began to edge away from that one and forged clear in mid-stretch then
held safe. UNCLE NICK was forwardly-positioned early, dropped back leaving the backstretch and into the turn, saved ground inside on that bend, came out
four wide in upper stretch, was gaining too late. TEA AFTER BALLET raced last but one near but off the rail through the turn, came out a bit in the stretch,
kicked on to just get up for show honors. SANTINO'S FANTASY was well-placed early, engaged the eventual winner dueling inside that one up the
backstretch and on the turn, weakened in the stretch and lost show honors late. FAITHFUL KING switched outside the leaders in the early going, pursued
from the three to four path on the turn, failed to rally. IRONMAN RICHIE pursued the pace from outside, went three to five wide drifting out a bit while
weakening into the stretch, was eased late and walked off. TEA WITH LEMON broke a step slowly, lacked early speed, was outpaced.

Footnotes
SONO GRATO was shuffled back after the start, allowed to settle into stride racing well off the inside at the back, advanced outside foes circling five wide
on the far turn and taking the lead about the five-sixteenths, drew off in upper stretch, lasted. EMPTY HOLSTER settled at the back inside, advanced on the
far turn racing off the rail, waited briefly past the five-sixteenths, found room between runners six wide in upper stretch, finished up strongly gaining on the
winner but too late. SOUPER FORTUNE set the pace racing just off the rail, was overtaken late on the far turn, switched outside the new leader in upper- to
mid-stretch, had no extra. STORM BORN tracked from inside, came out at the top of the stretch, ran on. MEATLOAF'S CHANCE was caught four wide on
the first turn moving forward outside foes and shifting in to be three deep racing just off the leader, was within range three wide on the far turn, fanned seven
wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. FLYING SAMURAI settled racing off the inside in behind the leading quartet, went four wide on the far
turn almost within striking distance, failed to menace late. MOVE ON OVER was forwardly-positioned three wide early, dropped back and faded.

GRAND HIDEAWAY settled mid-pack racing three wide on the turn, came out six wide in upper stretch, drove past late. IAN GLASS bumped the inside rival
at the start, was among the early leaders then settled just off that pair racing outside, stalked four wide into the turn, kicked on to take the lead a sixteenth
from home but was nailed late. MALPAIS soon led facing pressure from outside foes setting the pace while just off the rail, weakened in late stretch but held
show. REAL NEWS shifted in, saved ground on the turn advancing to within range in upper stretch, came out late while evening out. STALLONE was
bumped and squeezed back at the start, shifted in racing off the pace inside saving ground early on the turn, angled six wide coming out of that bend, ran on
mildly late. ONE PUTT RICHIE raced outside off the leaders mostly four wide on the turn and swinging seven deep into upper stretch, ran on mildly but
needed more. NILES CHANNEL lacked early speed racing at the back, swung eight wide and improved. SIERRA HOTEL raced inside in the back half of the
field early, was never near enough to threaten. UPBEAT MELODY pressed then chased the pacesetter from outside three wide, came up empty. AZRAEL
broke a bit awkwardly, failed to menace. PER THE HORSERACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, GRAND HIDEAWAY HAS BEEN DQ'D DUE TO A
POSITIVE TEST.

IT'S MAGIC was bumped at the start, settled off the pace shifting in, saved ground on the turn advancing on the leaders, came out five wide at
three-sixteenths, lugged a bit in the lane but surged past late. ANGEL EXPRESS moved forward inside and soon to the front, set a pressured pace racing
just off the rail, was clear into upper stretch but outfinished. COMMISSIONER GULCH shifted in racing off the leading pair in behind up the backstretch,
advanced on or just off the rail on the turn, came out a bit in the stretch, ran on evenly late. BORDER STAR raced outside foes mid-pack three to four deep
on the turn, came out a bit turning for home, drifted in through upper stretch, ran on. GUSTAVI was reluctant to be mounted, acted up behind the gate,
broke just a hair slowly then was encouraged forward between runners, pressed the pace three wide into and on the turn, dropped back and faded while not
being persevered with through the final furlong. GOLD OAK chased off the leaders going between rivals into the turn, continued two to three deep on that
bend shifting out a bit turning for home, was forced in by a drifting rival in upper stretch, faded. FLYING COMET stumbled into a rival at the start nearly
losing the rider, raced at the back and off the inside, was never near enough to threaten.

NOTARY was well back of the leading trio racing off the fence, made a sweeping move outside four deep on the far turn taking the lead by the quarter pole
and drifting in a bit, continued to drift in and lightly brushed the inside foe late, was kept busy to the wire. BUCK MOON bobbled ever so slightly at the start
but went straight to the front, set a lively pace inside, dispatched the two nearest pursuers on the far turn but was overtaken by another rival at the quarter
pole, fought on stubbornly, was lightly brushed late and was outkicked. SILVER QUARTERS settled well back, rallied in tandem with and inside a rival in the
stretch to get up for show. MILLARD'S SMILE settled well back, raced off the inside, was outfinished for show while rallying in the lane. EMPIRE BUILDER
stalked three to four wide off the leading pair, was within range till upper stretch, faltered and faded. TREASURY pressed the pace up the backstretch,
began to drop back entering the far turn, switched outside foes to the three to four path about the seven-sixteenths, faded.

Footnotes
STORM'S REFLECTION raced two to three wide in the back half of the field early, was a little boxed in heading up the backstretch into the far turn, shifted
six wide coming out of that bend for room, drove past and cleared. LAWMAKER stalked two to three wide early, eased back off the pace and switched out
late up the backstretch, moved four then five then six wide on the far turn taking the lead at the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit, was outkicked but held
second. KINGSBURRY ATTACK settled outside foes toward the rear racing three to four wide, continued outside foes on the far turn, moved out a bit for the
drive and gained late. BRODY'S FLY was well-placed in behind the leaders tracking while saving ground near the rail, made a mild bid inside at the top of
the stretch but had no extra. CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN unhurriedly brought up the rear shifting nearer the rail, was still well back turning for home, guided out
seven deep, belatedly ran on. PAYNT BY LETTERS was hard to load, exchanged a bump at the start, was two to three wide just off the leaders through the
first turn, continued near but off the fence on the far turn gaining on the leaders coming past the quarter pole and within range, lacked the needed late kick.
STRIKE PRICE saved ground racing inside, went evenly. BAILEYS RUN set the pace racing inside on or just off the rail, drifted out leaving the far turn,
faded. I'M YOUR CAPTAIN exchanged a bump at the start, stalked from outside three to four wide early, advanced on the leader midway up the backstretch
to prompt that one, who then got away, moved again while three wide on the far turn pressing while being carried out five wide, tired in the stretch.
