Footnotes
SIR TERRE stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep to bid for the lead leaving the far turn then dueled through the
stretch. GUNSLINGER (IRE) set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged leaving the far turn then gamely dueled inside the winner through the lane.
BRILLIANT CHASE saved ground on the turns, was well positioned along the inner rail through the stretch and lacked the necessary late response. JOHNG
, shuffled back soon after the break, circled the far turn three wide, floated to the four path in upper stretch, loomed in mid stretch and failed to sustain the
move. SUPER E lacked speed, swung to the five path in upper stretch, raced outside horses and passed tired ones. U S CONSTITUTION chased the pace
outside GUNSLINGER down the backstretch, challenged for the lead between horses near the three eighths pole and gave way. SAMUI SUNSET , taken to
the four path in upper stretch, lacked a rally.

Footnotes
STREET HUSTLE hopped at the break, recovered and pulled his way forward and bid inside a pair of rivals leaving the five eighths, took over with a half to
go, cleared without much asking past the three eighths then was guided off the rail, moved out to a long lead while under a drive in mid stretch then
continued well in front while kept alert to the wire. SHACKINTHEBOX , off the pace while saving ground, was under a ride mid turn, eased out into the lane,
split rivals past the three sixteenths and continued on willingly to be second best. POMPOUS PRINCE disputed the early pace three wide outside ISLAND
D'LITE, was headed near the half, stayed on to give hard chased three to four wide into the lane then kept on with effort to the finish. ISLAND D'LITE had
speed to the inside of POMPOUS PRINCE, was rated back off the leading pair heading to the half, dropped in to pursue, remained a presence to upper
stretch then weakened. SIR SMOAK , outrun, raced wide in upper stretch.

UNCAPTURED STORM stumbled at the break, rushed up in the two path between horses down the backstretch, dueled inside SUPERSTITIEUX around
the turn and to the eighth pole then drove clear. SALTY HEIR saved ground around the turn, swung to the four path turning for home, raced on his left lead
and rallied mildly. SUPERSTITIEUX , three deep disputing the pace around the turn, battled to mid stretch then faded. OROCOVIX lacked speed, raced in
the two path between horses leaving the turn then rallied inside rivals. TYLER TIME saved ground on the turn, swung wide in upper stretch and failed to
menace. NOTION TO TAPIT , unhurried to the stretch, had a late move between horses. WONDER WATER , wide on the turn, came up empty. POLSAR ,
four wide on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. HE'S ON FIRE showed speed along the inner rail, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
TALK TO THE JUDGE sped to the early lead towards the rail, handled outside pressure from FAST TRACKED around the far turn, widened a bit when put
to serious asking into the lane, dug in when confronted by LIQUIDATOR in mid stretch, kept on tenaciously under strong handling and proved resolute to the
wire. LIQUIDATOR , taken to rate three to four wide after an alert beginning, commenced a run when given her cue past the three eighths, circled four wide
with progress into the stretch, ranged up to engage the winner a furlong out, continued gamely but was kept at bay. ROWSIE EXPRESS , urged to the
inside of a rival leaving the three eighths, shifted out four to five wide in upper stretch and found her best stride through the final sixteenth. WILLFUL
DESIRE prompted the early pace three wide, saved ground stalking mid turn, eased out with aim in upper stretch, gave hard chase past the furlong grounds
but one paced from there. FAST TRACKED broke a step slow, rushed up and quickly gained between runners near the five eighths, forced the pace outside
the winner while under coaxing, saw that one het away a bit entering the stretch and faded a touch late. SOLVING PROGRESS pulled early while three to
four wide, was ridden along past the five sixteenths, raced between runners in mid stretch then lacked a bid. PRECIOUS AVARY , fractious in the gate,
broke awkwardly and found herself well off the early pace, saved ground throughout but failed to generate a serious run. MALIBU MOONSHINE , sluggish
from the gate, lagged well back under urging, picked things up a bit four wide past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and weakened.

BONDED found a nice spot early on and tracked the dueling leaders while towards the inside, eased out and found room soon into the lane, responded and
went up to collar NEW YORK PANTHER in mid stretch, wrested command with about a sixteenth to go and drew clear under a drive. NEW YORK
PANTHER disputed the pace to the inside of UNORTHODOX, was coaxed clear into the lane, wandered outward under left handed asking nearing mid
stretch, could not contain the winner past the sixteenth pole, gave way grudgingly and narrowly saved the place. MR. SHADES OF GRAY broke a bit slow,
edged up soon after the was fanned about four wide into the first turn, recovered to rate outside a rival and well within range through the backstretch run,
awaited room soon into the lane then was caught in traffic, split rivals leaving the sixteenth marker, finished up well but missed second. INVECTIVE , taken
to rate off the pace while saving ground, took closer order behind the winner approaching the stretch, stayed inside and advanced past mid stretch, loomed
but flattened out late. DAREDAVITE settled off the inside, gained four wide into the stretch, continued with some progress outside rivals past mid stretch,
switched over to his left lead in deep stretch and hung. RECONVENE , off the pace, saved ground into the lane, eased out to pursue near mid stretch but
lacked the needed finish. SOUTHPAW MIKE , a bit keen early, steadied off heels then got a bit floating MR. SHADES OF GRAY, continued a bit eager
stalking outside a rival entering the backstretch, stayed in touch to about mid stretch then gave way. UNORTHODOX got into a pace scrum outside NEW
YORK PANTHER early on, carried that battle to about the quarter pole then succumbed.

Footnotes
BEGUINE took over almost at once, quickly cleared and set a rated pace just off the inside, responded and spurted away when roused soon into the lane,
drifted out a bit under pressure inside the furlong grounds, was corrected with right handed encouragement and held firm. RESPONSE TIME got her head
turned straight just as the gates sprung, was taken to rate three wide outside a rival early on, advanced past the five sixteenths to have aim on the winner,
was under solid encouragement soon into the lane, wandered outward past mid stretch, straightened and kept on well. DREAMSTER settled early then was
nudged up behind rivals while saving ground heading to the half, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide with chase into the stretch, lugged in past
mid stretch and came up empty. GUNNING prompted to the inside of a rival early on, came under heavy pressure mid turn, failed to kick on, faded and
drifted out some late. SIX THE HARD WAY , off the pace, angled five wide for the drive but failed to respond.

LIGHTENING LARRY , a forward factor three deep around the turn, chased the pace, closed resolutely the final sixteenth of a mile, led late, returned a bit
sore and was vanned off. WONDRWHERECRAIGIS sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, opened up leaving the turn, finished willingly but was
second best. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , taken to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, remained along the rail there after and passed a tired rival
late. SIR WELLINGTON prompted the pace outside WONDRWHERECRAIGIS around the turn and gave way through the stretch. THREES OVER

INSIDE STUNT vied between rivals on a short lead early on, dropped in and set a pressured pace around the turn, spurted clear when roused and guided
off the inside soon into the lane, turned away an inside challenge from STAR SHOPPING leaving the sixteenth pole, cleared again and held firm while kept
alert. STIMULUS MAKER broke slowly, raced off the rail and off the early pace, gained three wide into the lane, dropped in to work between runners leaving
mid stretch and continued on willingly to gain the place. STAR SHOPPING vied inside a pair of foes early on, was rated back nearing the turn and stalked
while saving ground, was afforded a seam along the rail to come back near mid stretch, battled with the winner to about the sixteenth pole then gave way
grudgingly. CLAUDEE BOY broke a step slow, edged up between runners early, shifted four wide while still between foes into the stretch, chased and hung
late. SPEAKERIT , three wide outside the winner, forced the pace to upper stretch then faded in the final sixteenth. BOWIE TWO STEP circled the turn four
to five wide, switched over to his correct lead leaving the furlong grounds but failed to kick on. SCOTTY BROWN saved ground, checked off heels entering
the turn, remained inside and fade.
