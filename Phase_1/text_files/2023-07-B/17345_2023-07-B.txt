BILLY THE GREEK bobbled at the break and recovered outwards bumping COWBOY CODE and forcing that foe to take brief hold, chased just off the
inside just off the pace, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive rallying into contention a furlong out, dug in taking narrow command inside the final seventy yards, got placed in tight as SAME OLD FEARS came
inwards bumping ANCHISES into him and was directed slightly off the rail after the bump sending a small bump back outwards while just prevailing on the
wire. FOXHOLE four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command the outermost of a quartet inside the final furlong, got brushed by SAME OLD FEARS near the
sixteenth marker as that rival came out, came inwards slightly after that rival corrected and drifted in getting slightly pinched out between foes, followed him
inwards, then got clipped behind by that same rival when just missing at the finish. ANCHISES three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had SAME OLD FEARS drift in front near the sixteenth marker and altered in
to the two path moving into a seam between foes, rallied on into that lane and was bumped by SAME OLD FEARS as that foe came in after brushing
FOXHOLE and in turn bumped BILLY THE GREEK nearing the finish, had that rival come slightly out and was bumped again, this time bumping SAME OLD
FEARS in behind FOXHOLE while steadied in tight between rivals to the finish. SAME OLD FEARS established the front and showed the way three then
two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat, came out and brushed with FOXHOLE
near the sixteenth marker when headed for command, got corrected and came inwards seventy yards from home bumping ANCHISES into BILLY THE
GREEK who rode through the tightness and bumping coming back out slightly to send a chain of bumps back outwards forcing ANCHISES to steady and
pushing SAME OLD FEARS back out now in behind FOXHOLE, clipped heels with that rival and fell heavily directly over the finish line, the rider coming out
of the saddle only after the finish, then was subsequently vanned off. COWBOY CODE got bumped at the start by BILLY THE GREEK and then got forced
to steady behind that rival when he took over his lane and conceded four to five lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside down
the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid while never threatening. EVERY
FOUR YEARS stumbled at the start, chased four wide coming under coaxing just past the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired.
There was a Stewards' Inquiry into deep stretch focusing on the incident at the finish. After review the result was allowed to stand before the race was
declared official.

Footnotes
HEADLAND brushed with a rival at the start then brushed again with that same foe early, pressed the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the
three path on the turn, gained a short lead before the five-sixteenths, responded well when asked at the top of the stretch, kicked clear inside the
three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. TOP GUN GIRL broke out and bobbled then brushed with a rival, brushed again with that opponent
early, showed the way under pressure from both sides, vied in the two path while inside of the winner on the turn, was headed near the five-sixteenths, lost
touch with the winner inside the three-sixteenths and proved no match while clear for the place. ROSEBUG moved out early while at the rear, drifted out
near the nine-sixteenths, angled in late on the backstretch, raced in the two path early on the turn then was roused in the three path later on the bend, was
driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. EDIE MEENY MINY MO was hustled from the gate, pressed the
pace on the inside of two foes, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn and tired. BRAGANZA was off a bit slow then angled out
early, raced at the rear under urging then caught up with ROSEBUG near the five-eighths, was carried out near the nine-sixteenths, moved in late on the
backstretch, chased four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch then quickly drifted well out and in the track and faltered.

Footnotes
SCOTLAND moved in while showing early speed, raced inside on the first turn, was well rated while setting the pace on the inside of a foe, vied in the two
path on the far turn, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, shook clear in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop near the furlong
marker, remained under the crop until just before the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride and was eased up late while much the best. IL
MIRACOLO was hustled from the gate then established a forward position, had the rider drop anchor into the first turn, raced in the three path under stout
restraint on that bend, prompted the pace on the outside, drew even inside the three-quarter pole, was let out in the three path on the far turn, lost touch with
the winner under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. BLAZING SEVENS bumped with a rival at the start then jostled with
that same foe, went three wide for most of the first turn then shifted to the four path, was rated just off the pace on the outside, came under urging in the four
path on the far turn, was put to the crop outside the quarter-pole, pursued the top two into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the show. LOST ARK
broke out and bumped with an opponent then jostled with that same rival early, went around the first turn in the two path, was rated just off the pace
between foes, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path under strong encouragement on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch under the crop and failed to respond. PERFORM was rated inside on the first turn, became rank late on that bend and was
taken under a tighter hold then was taken up, raced just off the pace, dropped back under urging leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and
had nothing left.

Footnotes
TIE BREAKER coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, took over
command at the three-sixteenths and drew clear under a drive to prevail. VAUNTED grew a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start inspiring a brief and
small rebellion from ALPHA SONNY and SIN NOMBRE soon after, broke out at the start bumping ALPHA SONNY into SIN NOMBRE, chased two to three
wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to be along clear for
the place honors. UNDER THE KNIFE broke in at the start bumping and forcing SIN NOMBRE to steady and alter briefly, chased four then three wide in aim
of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SINALOA chased two to three
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. WOODSIDE WARRIOR hustled from the gate,
chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away and weakened. THE
GOLDEN ONE stumbled at the start conceding three to four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased four then three wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. IMPULSIVE SPENDING chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. STEERAGE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until
tucked inside through the turn and was placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under threat, yielded near the
three-sixteenths and weakened to the finish. ALPHA SONNY grew fractious in the gate just after VAUNTED did and then inspired SIN NOMBRE to do so,
got bumped at the start by VAUNTED and in turn bumped SIN NOMBRE, chased six to seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked five wide
through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened. SIN NOMBRE grew fractious when inspired by ALPHA SONNY to do so as that rival
got fractious just prior, got bumped and steadied at the start and altered outwards conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased eight
to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went nine wide into upper stretch and offered no kick. IT'S NOT MY
FAULT three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, faded and faltered in the
drive and was eased through the final furlong to the finish.

COSTA TERRA moved in entering the first turn, went three wide on that bend, was reserved in the back half of the field, came under urging while three then
four wide on the far turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, made a bid under a left-handed crop at the three-sixteenths, swapped back to his inside
lead at the furlong marker, gained the advantage outside the sixteenth-pole, switched back to the proper lead inside that pole and moved clear under good
handling. ROYAL SPIRIT was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside while in hand, took the lead midway through the far turn, shook clear
while asked coming to the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, led desperately into the final furlong then was overtaken while well
clear for the place. O CAPTAIN brushed with a rival after the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace, chased three wide on the far
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened while best of the rest. C FALLS went to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked on
the far turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths and tired then was vanned off after the race. CATCH THAT PARTY was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths, rounded the first turn in the two path, dropped back some early on the backstretch, was reserved while last but one, moved from the two path to the
four path on the final turn and failed to threaten. GOOD MEDICINE brushed with a foe after the start, was rated on the inside, saved ground under urging on
the far turn and came up empty. HILLIARD went two to three wide on the turns while at the rear and was no factor. BABY BILLY was hustled from the gate,
went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, came up empty while going from the four path to the seven
path on the far turn and faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
ABADIN established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside settled into a comfortable rhythm under some pressure from SILO RIDGE to the
outside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, held well to
the finish. TREATY OBLIGATION three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
and offered up a mild kick to secure the place honors. COALVILLE chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then flattened out in the late stages while safe for the show honors. LUCENCY struck the near side stall at
the start conceding two to three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide at the quarter
pole, then angled out to be eight to nine wide straightened away and kicked on belatedly to the finish. SILO RIDGE prompted the pace of ABADIN from the
outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BIG NIGHT OUT broke in at
the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. CREATE
TROUBLE four then three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BREES
veered in at the start and conceded five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased along the inside climbing greenly and facing kickback
while growing detached at the tail of the field, tipped briefly to the two path through the turn before taking the inside route into upper stretch and made no
impact. GAME KEEPER got steadied when pinched out between foes six and a half furlongs from home, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MOTIVO stumbled at the start conceding four lengths before settling into stride,
chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide for home and tired.

BRIGHT FUTURE went around the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the far turn then chased
the leader, gained under a drive to make a bid in the four path into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, extended the advantage under a
right-handed crop into the final sixteenth then was hand-ridden to the finish while much the best. SPEED BIAS bumped lightly with a foe at the start then
was coaxed to the front, raced inside on the first turn, showed the way with company to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the far turn, was asked
near the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner. ARTORIUS brushed the outside of the gate at the
start, came inward early, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace on the outside, ranged up three to four wide on the far turn, made a bid
while roused five wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired then missed the place while clear for the show. THE REDS made light
contact with an opponent at the start, bumped with another rival early, dropped to the rail into the first turn, was well placed on the inside, came under urging
while continuing to save ground on the far turn and capitulated. CURBSTONE was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, settled on the inside, was
asked late on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CONSTITUTIONLAWYER brushed the
outside of the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled off the pace, was roused near the seven-sixteenths, went two then three wide
on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MAJOR BLUE was caught five wide early on the first turn then dropped to the
three path while taking an opponents path, settled towards the rear, was roused with a half-mile to run, went three wide on the far turn and also failed to
respond. KUCHAR was sent hard from the start, bumped with a rival early then was taken up while put in tight between horses, checked in the three path
when shut-off early on the first turn, was reserved at the back, was urged four then five wide on the far turn and was no factor. MONTAUK POINT went four
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged four wide on the far turn and faltered.

wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on willingly to
secure the place honors in the final jumps to the finish. SECRET MONEY established the front shortly after the start and showed the way crossing to the
inside through the first turn before taking to the two path down the backstretch, settled into a comfortable rhythm under attendance from PRINCESS
BETTINA to the outside but facing little pressure save her presence, remained in the two path through the far turn coming under coaxing under challenge for
the initial time with five-sixteenths to go, swung three then two wide shaking off her escort straightened away confronted by a flanking pair of stable and barn
mates, dug in and was collared a furlong from home, fought on between those rivals loosely to the finish, clear for the show honors. REVALITA (FR) three
wide through the first turn, chased four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
LIGURIA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled six wide into upper stretch, offered no response.
TRYINMYHEARTOUT got away to awkward stumble at the start, raced three then two wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide down the
backstretch before tucking inside through the far turn, tipped three then two wide into upper stretch and weakened. PRINCESS BETTINA attended the
leader from the outside three wide before coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths to issue a challenge for the initial time, swung four wide into upper
stretch in the midst of being shaken off, then weakened in the stretch. LIL MISS MOONLIGHT three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
BOURBON CHASE bumped hard multiple times with a rival at the start, dropped back while saving ground on the first turn, moved out on the backstretch,
rallied four wide on the far turn, closed well to get the lead into upper stretch then drifted in under a left-handed crop, fought outside of the runner-up to the
sixteenth-pole, came in a bit more shortly thereafter then moved clear late to prevail. MISSION HILL bumped hard multiple times with foes on both sides at
the start, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, drafted inside on the far turn, was asked at the
quarter-pole, cut the corner through a rail opening into upper stretch, made a bid inside the three-sixteenths, fought inside of the winner into the final
sixteenth, shied when that foe came in a touch shortly thereafter then was taken up while moving over heels late and missed but was well clear for the
place. LT. MITCHELL went to the front, dropped from the six path to the two path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two
path on the far turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch then dropped back and weakened but was clear for the show. UTAMARO dropped from the five
path to the three path on the first turn, settled in the middle of the field, dropped back three wide on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch and failed to
rally. BORDER PATROL went two to three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked near the half-mile pole, chased in the three
path on the far turn, dropped back late on that bend and tired. TONY O lost his footing at the start, traveled four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear,
moved from three to five wide under urging on the far turn and was no factor. ALL GOOD HERE rounded the first turn in the four path, settled on the
outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, chased four then three wide on the turn, made a bid coming to the five-sixteenths, dropped back in
upper stretch and capitulated. TIP OF THE BOOT bumped hard with a foe at the start, raced three wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, was
roused near the nine-sixteenths, went around the far turn under urging while inside to the two path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to respond.
FOLLOWING A RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL AND A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN, THERE WAS NO CHANGE MADE TO THE ORDER
OF FINISH
