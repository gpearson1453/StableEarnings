Footnotes
DOCTOR LEO raced mid pack, closed down the stretch and was able to get up in time. FIERY PLAYBOY stalked the pace, was cleared by an outside foe,
chased down the lane, was no match for the winner but was second best today. LILRASCALMAN off slow put in a mild bid late. SLITHER raced off of the
pace and maintained position through out. BIBLEMAN vied for the lead, set the pace, tired. TARGET PRACTICE showed little.
