Footnotes
MO ARETHA was never far back, advanced to the turn, rallied five wide and wore down DEVINE CANDY to get up late and was all out at the wire. DEVINE
CANDY bumped at the start, was sent to the front to set the pace to deep stretch and was outfinished in a good effort. CAROLS KITTEN raced mid pack,
went seven wide leaving the turn, found her best stride late, was gaining ground and up late for show. HUSHED stalked the pace along the inside, bid off
the rail, went willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late and was caught for third. EUROBOUTTOGETIT was never far off the pace, raced inside and
lacked the needed late response. FLASHY GAIL broke out to be away slowly, went widest in the drive and failed to threaten. SHE'S A PLAYER broke
slowly, angled out into the turn, passed a tiring rival and was not urged in the stretch. BOUJEE BRITT pressed the pace to the turn and stopped.

CATALE STORM was last away, rallied three across on the first turn, assumed command and inched away into the backstretch, continued to set the pace
and held well in a driving finish. RECKLESSNESS was taken back from between horses entering the backstretch, pressed the pace, swung wide leaving the
second turn, closed once straightened and finished second best. REMEMBER ME TONY raced close to the pace, lacked a late rally and settled for show.

YANKEE INDIAN was pushed out at the start, pressed the pace, closed steadily and wore down ROBERT WHO to get up late. ROBERT WHO broke out,
set the pace, led to deep stretch and was outfinished despite steady urging. SWEET BAKER raced close to the pace, fell back on the backstretch to race
mid pack, rallied on the turn, bid three wide and closed to get up for show while no threat to the top two. BRICKTOWN BROWN raced inside, was always
within range, lacked a rally and was outfinished for third. MONET'S DEVIL angled out on the first turn, swung wide entering the backstretch, angled back in
on the second turn, bid inside and had little left. SAZON showed little.

outside, closed willingly, didn't have enough left and held for place. LARCH saved ground, angled out into the second turn, swung wide and finished well.
WIN FOR FUN was away alertly, was hustled along to vie along the inside, was steadied on the second turn, fell back and continued willingly to the wire.

ABSAROKA set the pace and held well while under pressure late. DRIFTING WEST chased the pace, couldn't gain on the winner and finished second best.
ROYALLY was unhurried early and raced in the back, rallied into the far turn, bid inside and closed to earn show. UNRESTRICTED was void of early speed,
swung wide entering the stretch and offered a mild bid only. BOX SEAT raced mid pack towards the outside and failed to menace in an even effort.
PALATIAL TIMES stalked the pace to the far turn, tired and gave way. PINKY RING BLING was hustled along, angled out on the first turn, raced in close,
tired into far turn and stopped. HOOVES YOUR DADDY was crowded on the first turn, dropped back, lacked a bid and was outrun.

Footnotes
LANGMEAD set a pressured pace to the second turn and drew clear. SPIN TO WIN moved up three wide on the backstretch to press the pace to the
second turn, fell back and finished second best. BINDING HEART pressed the pace around the first turn, fell back, bid inside on the second turn, earned
show and was clearly best of the rest. LITTLE MAD MAX got away well, showed good early speed, was through early and dropped back. BIG BUDDS
BROWN bore out on the first turn, raced in the back in an even effort and was outrun. POWER PROJECTION was carried out on the first turn and trailed
the field.
