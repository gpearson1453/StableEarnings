Footnotes
HIGH DOLLAR HUSH bumped at the start, set a pressured pace, drew clear on the turn and widened under mild left handed urging. MARKING'S MIRACLE
was void of early speed, rallied on the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and closed to earn place while no threat to the winner. CANDY TRACK was
slow early, raced outside, swung wide leaving the turn and closed to get up for show. KAYE was taken outside, raced close to the pace, rallied on the turn to
loom a threat and came up empty in the drive. BEVERLY WHO broke out and bumped at the start, raced mid pack inside, angled out into the turn and
lacked a bid. BYE BYE HANNAHBO came in at the start, dropped inside, was checked entering the turn, dropped back and faded. EMOTION N DEVOTION
was fractious in the gate, broke a step slowly and was outrun in an even effort. SPLISH SPLASH broke awkwardly and bumped at the start, pressed the
pace to the turn and gave way. JOJO'S GIRL bumped at the start, pressed the pace three across, dropped inside and stopped.

Footnotes
TRUST MANDO raced close to the pace along the inside, awaited room on the turn, angled out, bid between horses, dueled through the stretch and proved
best. CHUCKIES CHANCE vied throughout and was outfinished in a game effort. STRYDER raced in the second flight between horses, shifted out on the
turn, bid five wide and went willingly to the wire. THE TIME'S RIGHT raced mid pack inside, bid off the rail and had little left for the drive. BOOMER WHO
vied inside to the second turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. GATLING GOLD bumped at the start, was slow early, swung wide leaving the turn
and improved position. REAL PENNY raced close to the pace in a wide trip, showed speed to the turn and flattened out. STELLARSBLUERIBBON passed
tiring rivals in an inside trip. FRANKS DEHERE was outrun in an even effort. ROAD TO HEAT vied between horses to the second turn and stopped.

unhurried early, raced along the inside, awaited room on the turn, shifted out, closed willingly and didn't have enough late. MY SPECIAL MISTAKE moved
up to press the pace three across, fell back on the turn and went evenly late. WEALTH N HEALTH saved ground, lacked a rally and did not threaten. BIGG

Footnotes
DIABOLICAL RULER was sent from the gate, pressed the pace, challenged for the lead on the turn, got a head in front, drew clear and held off a closing
CERVEZA. CERVEZA pressed the pace four wide, fell back leaving the turn, continued to close once straightened and was gaining late. MCTHANKS was
void of early speed, rallied around the turn, went widest in the drive and finished well to get up at the wire for show. TUCUM moved up inside to set a
pressure pace, leveled off once headed and was caught for third. STORMIN FAST lagged early, raced inside, angled out for the drive and finished well.
AMERICAN SOLO dropped inside to save ground, offered a mild bid and improved position. ON A WARPATH pressed the pace to the turn, tired and gave
way.

late response. MARKED BY A STORM raced inside, angled out for the drive, swung wide and closed well. LIL MISS CASSIE bumped start, vied to the turn,
fell back, leveled off and faded from contention. MISS TRICKY INDY vied to the turn, fell back and gave way. RUNNING FOR GRACE broke out and
