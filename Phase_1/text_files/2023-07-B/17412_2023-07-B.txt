Footnotes
APPEALING SENORITA had speed from the start, drew on even terms for the lead past the five sixteenths pole, battled until deep stretch and edged clear
late under left handed urging. SHEZA POP STAR was hustled from the start, saved ground through the turn, drifted to the five path through the stretch and
rallied for second. RONNI'S DAY away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch, dueled until the final stages and was outfinished.
BAREFOOT BEACH stalked the pace and went evenly. CAN I GO TOO failed to menace. HIGH CUPPER was no threat. PROPER ETIQUETTE had good
early speed three wide, dropped back before the turn, came on again entering the turn then folded in upper stretch.

Footnotes
LEOMBRUNO broke in front, set all the pace, widened through the stretch under right handed urging and won as much the best under confident handling.
RIDING IN THE WIND allowed to settle, improved position two wide past the quarter pole and finished well clear for second. DERBYS MONEYMAKER
stalked the pace near the inside and lacked the needed response. PERCENTAGE raced outside, drifted past the middle of the racetrack through the stretch
and lost ground. FORT RAMSEY chased the winner two wide and stopped in the stretch. FARM STRONG trailed.

ROYAL DRAGOON slow early, closed with a rush between rivals two wide into the stretch, made the lead at the furlong marker and proved best under
strong handling. LATIN SPICE dueled for the lead two wide into the stretch, was carried out to the five path giving up position, dug in determinedly late and
gamely gained second. JOHN'S ROCK stalked the pace outside and finished with good courage five wide. TIMESATAPPIN never far back, loomed boldly
along the rail into the stretch but was outfinished. DREAM KEEPER battled for the lead along the inside past the quarter pole, drifted to the five path then
was outfinished. MANSFIELD TIGER pressed the pace three wide into the stretch, was carried out to the six path then weakened stretch.

Footnotes
ORFANO delayed the start while reluctant to load, broke alertly, was forced inward leaving the chute, rallied three wide through the turn to make the lead
entering the stretch then drew off late under right handed urging. SYNERGISTIC drifted inward leaving chute, stalked the early pace, loomed boldly two
wide nearing the quarter pole, dropped inside before mid stretch and was no match for the winner. KNOCK WOOD was in tight leaving the chute, settled
within striking distance and had a mild rally late in the four path. SPECIALIZED broke slowly, raced wide and went evenly. HARSH TRUTH passed tiring
rivals outside. SHOWTIME BOY chased the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. EL SORDO was in tight leaving the chute then no factor.
ROUGE TU RICHES was fractious in the gate and no threat. FIERCELY BRAVE was through early. BAD BOY BOOGIE broke in front, set the pace well of
the rail down the backstretch, angled in on the turn then stopped after a half. MOR CRAFTY had brief speed. THE RIDER OF KNOCK WOOD LODGED A
CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS
UPHELD THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
