Footnotes
BE SINCERE was unhurried out of the gate and raced in the back up the backstretch, let out a notch and moved up five wide to challenge for the lead at the
quarter pole, gained a slim lead then driven to clear command approaching the eighth pole, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. HOP AWAY
HOTTIE was forwardly placed two wide around the first turn, dueled for the lead between rivals past the half mile marker and around the far turn, saved
ground entering the lane, could not move on with the eventual winner but kept on with response and secured second best. CAN'T MAKE ME raced up close
around the first turn and dueled for the lead past the half mile marker, continued to match strides into the far turn, got collared by the winner past the quarter
pole, came two wide into the lane and finished well clear over the rest. MOLLY BYE O held a slim lead in early stages then vied for the lead three wide
between foes, continued to match strides into the far turn, flattened out near the five sixteenths pole and continued to tire in the drive. KAMEA failed to move
into contention. BLITZED pressed the pace in early stages, dueled for the lead midway through the backstretch, could not keep pace leaving the five
sixteenths pole and steadily retreated.

MUNNYCANTBUYMELOVE was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground around the first turn, continued unhurried up the backstretch and
around the far turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and forged clear in deep stretch. COLORFUL NATIVE sped to the lead soon after
the start and held a clear lead around the first turn, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursues around the far turn, continued to dig
in gamely while holding onto a diminishing lead then got overtaken when the winner swept by late. A BRUSH OF LUCK stalked the clear leader up the
backstretch, picked up the pace and moved into contention around the far turn, dug in three deep a furlong out, raced in striking distance then failed to kick
on late. JUST JOHNNY tracked the clear pace setter up the backstretch, moved up closer along the rail around the far turn, sustained inside bid through the
lane, raced in striking striking distance then evened out late. UNCLE CHAD rated off the early pace, was ridden up into contention around the far turn,
sustained three wide bid into the lane then flattened out in the final furlong. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE failed to move into contention.

BE MY HUCKLEBERRY broke sharply and quickly gained a clear lead, continued with a clear advantage still racing in hand around the turn, saved ground
entering the lane, responded willingly when called upon, tapped a few times, drew off and kept to task. LOVE AMPLIFIED raced in contention tracking the
early leader, made a three to four wide run for rival around the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained a three wide bid and secured
second best. FREE WILL hustled along up the backstretch in pursuit of the early leader, coaxed two wide around the turn, ran on into the lane and cleared
the rest. DALUSIA raced off the early pace, saved ground then shifted out, hustled along four wide around the turn and never threatened. KONA KONNECT
was not too far back three wide in early stages, weakened entering the turn, saved ground into the lane and had no response.

SEASIDE BOY was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace midpack mid-way up the backstretch, let out a
notch entering the far turn and quickly took over the lead, cleared command, angled inside and finished going away. BUMPERDOO stalked along the inside
up the backstretch, launched a rail bid near the quarter pole, cut the corner entering the lane, tipped two wide for the drive and cleared second best. HARD
ATTACK was unhurried and raced in the back, saved ground then shifted out four to five wide at the head of the lane, finished with response and captured a
share. BROADWAY PETE pressed the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, ran on into the lane and got edged late for
show. MEGATAP raced in the mix mid-way up the backstretch, weakened nearing the far turn and had no further response. DAVIDIC LINE set a soft pace
in early stages while racing under pressure from BROADWAY PETE, briefly shook free entering the far turn then got collared by the winner and faded
through the lane.

Footnotes
RUNNING ALEX'SBAND secured inside position around the first turn, stalked the pace in the early backstretch, advanced along the rail to challenge for the
lead late on the backstretch, battled on with ALLO ENRY around the far turn, shook free to a slim lead in upper stretch then pulled away. ALLO ENRY set a
pressured pace into the early backstretch, took on added challengers past the half mile marker, battled on with RUNNING ALEX'SBAND around the turn,
could not match with eventual winner past upper stretch but stayed on with response and cleared second best. BACKGATE RED was well reserved and
trailed the field, saved ground around the far turn and gained a share. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was unhurried through early stages, chased three wide
around the turn, ran on into the lane and had a mild improve. BIG PINES SANDY rated just off the early leaders, moved up to challenge for the lead late on
the backstretch, vied briefly then chased four wide round the far turn and came up empty in the lane. MAHOMES pressed the pace around the first turn and
into early backstretch, briefly vied for the lead nearing the far turn, ran on three wide then retreated in stretch run. ALLEN'S ROCKET tracked the pace in
early stages, dueled briefly late on the backstretch then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
KIRBY KAYE came away a step slow at the start and raced off the early pace, ranged up closer moving through the turn, swung four wide into the lane,
gathered ground along the outside, dug in gamely in deep stretch and got by in closing strides. TRUE EMOTION tracked the pace through early stages,
launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, advanced into striking distance at the sixteenth pole, continued to inch up to the lead then got denied
nearing the wire. HOODWICKED got bumped a bit at the start then vied inside of DELTA MOON for the lead up the backstretch, battled on around the turn,
shook free at the head of the lane, continued to lead the way by a narrow margin then got outkicked late. JILL'S LEMON DROP broke in and bumped rivals
at the start, raced in contention but lacked racing room past the half mile marker, tugged a bit and steadied past the three eighths pole then waited patiently,
launched a two wide bid at the head of the lane, moved back inside, raced up close then evened out in final stages. DELTA MOON vied outside of
HOODWINKED for the lead up the backstretch, battled on around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane and steadily weakned. LUCKY
GIN got bumped at the start, raced in the back and failed to move into contention.
