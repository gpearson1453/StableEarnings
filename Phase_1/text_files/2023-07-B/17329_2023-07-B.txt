Footnotes
SETTECENTO was forwardly placed sixed deep into the first turn then dropped back off the speed duel and angled into the four path, ridden along on the
far turn, tipped four wide into the lane, bid four deep in upper stretch and proved best over UNIVERSAL PAYDAY in the late stages. UNIVERSAL PAYDAY
raced up close three deep into the first turn then took a stalking position, angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the drive, bid five deep at the top
of the stretch and got outkicked by SETTECENTO in the final sixteenth. NEXT REVOLT showed early speed four deep then chased the top pair three wide
into the backstretch, moved up to challenge again three deep and between rivals, battled into and around the far turn, could not kick on with outer pair in the
final furlong but kept on to save the show. GOOD JUJU dueled outside TONE FEELIN around the first turn, vied between in the middle stages, far turn and
into the stretch, fought to the eighth pole then flattened and got edged for the show. TONE FEELIN went up to challenge for command from inside, vied
inside a trio of rivals to the eight pole and weakened. MY INDY was off slow and bumped with inner rival, chased at the back three then shifted four wide on
the first turn, got floated out to the five path early on the far turn then angled back down to the three path and churned on to improve position in the lane.
BIG BUZZ got bumped on both sides at the start, raced inside a rival at the back into the clubhouse turn, continued near the back to the far turn, drifted out
and exited that bend six wide and failed to menace. TEMBO took a bump from outside at the start, was hustled between rivals then got put in a bit tight to
lose ground and climbed behind a rival into the first turn, raced off the rail and was coaxed along to move forward then had to pause past the three-quarter
pole, swung out leaving the far turn and could not rally. SOL DEL SUR prominent early five then four deep on the first turn, fought four deep up the
backstretch, chased inner trio then got put in tight entering the stretch and weakened after. FAR WEST became rank chasing early into the first turn and
was hard to ride around that bend before dropping back, trailed into the far turn, came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
DR. VENKMAN broke a step slow, stalked behind the leaders off the rail, tipped outside the leading trio around the bend, bid four deep into the lane, took
over and kicked clear in upper stretch, then drew off while drifting to the inside. BROADWAY UNIONS sat off the pace well off the rail early on, angled in
some entering the turn, looked to advance but got blocked behind rivals early on the bend while three to four wide, rallied in the drive and nailed UNCLE
REG for the place honors. UNCLE REG was closest in pursuit to the outside of the leading pair early, drew alongside leaving the backstretch, vied three
deep around the bend and carried a short lead into the stretch, failed to offer much resistance to DR. VENKMAN in upper stretch and got edged for second.
DAZZLEMESILVER stumbled leaving the gate, chased off the pace into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, steered out into the lane and
summoned a mild response to earn a minor award. MAUNA KEA BOUND came away slow in the beginning, raced on the inside near the back, angled off
the fence around the bend, steered back in a bit entering the drive and kept on to improve position. CENTRAL DISPATCH dueled for the lead from inside up
the backstretch, fought with outer rivals through the turn, could not kick on with the leaders in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. BYE BYE RAY
dueled for the lead from outside early, vied between foes around the bend and weakened down the lane. THRUST tracked five wide into the turn, moved
into the four path around the bend, got floated to the five path again entering the lane and lacked the needed response. PARK CITY settled off the pace and
steered inside, saved ground through the turn and came up empty. FIFTY CINCO climbed a bit and raced greenly while dropping back, trailed five then four
wide around the bend and was not a factor.

FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER reserved in the early going outside a rival near the back, lacked room early on the far turn, swung out leaving the bend, rallied
widest and bested BOLT'S BROAD late. BOLT'S BROAD raced along the inside towards the rear, was on the move between foes on the far turn, angled out
leaving the far turn, rallied through the lane and got outclosed in the late stages. LA PEER shifted in to bump rival leaving the gate, tracked outside a rival
early, roused three then four deep on the far turn, launched a bid in the lane but got outfinished. STRIKINGLY pulled while fighting three deep for the lead
early then took a stalking position around the clubhouse turn, took aim three wide into the lane, took over briefly in midstretch and got outkicked in the final
sixteenth. NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) took a bump from outside at the start, raced in mid-pack outside a rival early, moved closer between on the far turn,
got bumped by inner rival entering the stretch, looked to rally but lacked room past the eighth pole and was ridden out in the late stages. SAKURA FLAVOR
(IRE) traveled in mid-pack on the inside, lacked room around the far turn, steered out into the clear in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ENCOLPION vied
between rivals then raced keenly when trying to rate off inner rival, drew alongside again around the far turn, led into the stretch, clung to a narrow lead
when trying switch leads entering the final furlong and flattened in the furlong grounds once overtaken. TEA TREE BAY (GB) was a bit rank when trying to
be reserved in the early going, went outside a pair of rivals on the backstretch, got carried wide into the lane and could not threaten. OAK STREET BEACH
tracked along the inside, moved out in the lane and could not rally. IRISH MYTH broke in and bumped rival then dropped back while coaxed along, trailed to
the top of the stretch and was not a factor. MY MOON was rank early then began to pull while chasing early on, coaxed behind the leaders on the far turn,
bumped outer rival entering the lane, lacked room near the eighth pole and could not regain momentum. ROYALE DELTA vied inside rivals then took
control around the clubhouse turn, showed the way up the backstretch, met the challenge from outer rival on the second bend, relinquished the lead exiting
that turn, got crowded and checked past the eight pole and weakened.

Footnotes
AMBIVALENT chased between and got crowded slightly early, went two wide into the turn, was on the move while easing further out around the bend, came
four wide into the drive, rallied to the front with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. REXFORD broke a step slow, trailed on the inside into the bend,
angled out into the lane, rallied widest and gained the place honors. HELLADIC stepped to the front early then crossed over once in the clear, challenged by
rivals on the turn, carried a short lead into the final furlong, yielded to the winner at the sixteenth pole and got edged for second. KING APOLLO tracked
three deep into the turn, spun five wide into the lane and put in a mild late bid. BARSABAS traveled along the inside near the back, cut the corner into the
stretch and summoned a mild rally while needed to find more. YOGI BOY was off slow to begin, traveled between foes near the back early, got boxed in
near the three-eighths pole, went two then three wide on the turn and kept on through the lane. CHASIN MUNNY tracked off the rail then outside a rival, bid
three deep leaving the turn and got outkicked in the stretch. LIBERTY FOREVER chased on the inside, inched closer on the turn, asked in upper stretch but
faltered in the furlong grounds. SAULS CALL was closest in pursuit to the turn, bid from outside around the bend, fought to midstretch and leveled off in
deep stretch. FAYATHAAN (IRE) traveled in mid-pack in the early going, chased three deep into the lane and weakened. HOT ROD RUMBLE was stymied
early when losing his path along the inside, raced in mid-pack near the rail then chased two wide into the drive and weakened. AMERICAN OUTLAW
lunged right as the gates opened then dropped back off the pace, went four wide around the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
TWO RIVERS OVER was off slow to begin, chased two wide towards the rear early, on the move six wide on the far turn, rallied to the front at the sixteenth
pole and drove clear. THIRTY FOUR COUPE was closest in pursuit in the early going, challenged from outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch but
could not offer any resistance to the winner in the final sixteenth. CARDIFF CRACK chased three deep early, came three wide into the lane, moved out in
the lane and finished willingly while denied the place. DESERVEDLY cleared quickly and crossed over from outside, set the pace to the far turn, met the
challenge from THIRTY FOUR COUPE and maintained command into the lane, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. BIG HAT
WILLIE fractious in the gate, unhurried in the early going, chased four wide into the lane, moved out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally while unable
to threaten. GOLDENEYE chased between then had to pause when running up on heels early on the clubhouse turn, traveled between foes up the
backstretch, asked left handed two wide leaving the far turn and failed to respond. KEEN TO GO raced three wide off the pace early on, moved closer
leaving the backstretch, chased five wide into the drive and lacked a rally. CLOONEY trailed to the far turn, passed tired rivals while along the inside on the
far turn and could not make an impact. JIMMY THE BOOT was rank chasing along the inside into the first turn, traveled towards the rear in the middle
stagers, started to weaken two to three wide on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off. STAN FROM MALIBU rated along the inside early, dropped
back on the far turn, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

CONCLUDE showed early speed inside GAME TIME then ceded command on the clubhouse turn, remained closest in the middle stages, drew alongside
with three furlongs remaining, dueled around the far turn and took over nearing the top of the stretch, put away inner rival in upper stretch and stayed clear
under a drive to the wire. CLASSICAL CAT traveled in mid-pack on the inside, moved into range between leaving the backstretch, took aim two to three
wide on the far turn then bid three deep into the lane, could not keep up with the winner in the furlong grounds but was clearly second best. AH JEEZ
stalked the pace on the inside out of range, took closer order up the backstretch, coaxed along on the far turn then got boxed in behind the leaders at the
quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick but stayed on to hold the show. MAS RAPIDO (GB) reserved in the early going on the
inside then two wide, moved forward in the middle stages then put in a mild bid outside the top pair at the three-eighths pole, could not sustain the challenge
and chased three wide into the stretch and kept on for a minor award. GAME TIME bumped leaving the gate, cleared inner rival on the first turn and crossed
over, dueled around the far turn and lost command into the stretch, then flattened in the furlong grounds. AGENCY was off a bit slow to begin, started to pull
then lacked room on the first turn, tucked inside off the pace, driven two wide into the lane and failed to rally. ZE'BUL raced two wide near the back, coaxed
two to three wide on the far turn, tipped out in the drive and needed to find more. EL ORO (FR) veered in to bump rival in the beginning, saved ground to the
stretch and needed to find more in the lane. ZALAMO (FR) was off slow and bumped hard leaving the gate, trailed early on, raced off the rail around the far
turn, angled out at the top of the stretch and improved position. MR FISK tracked two then three wide early, got knocked into outer rival while four deep into
the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and could not rally. ESCAPE ARTIST got crowded between rivals early, raced three then two wide around the
first turn off the pace then went went between foes, shifted into outer rival early on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.
KID AZTECA tracked three then four wide early, got bumped while five deep early on the far turn, remained wide into the lane and failed to menace. EVER
A REBEL bumped with outer rival at the start, traveled four then three wide early, entered the lane two wide and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
SIR ATTICUS dueled for command from outside, kicked clear near the eighth pole and drew off to win convincingly. TAHOE SUNRISE chased five deep
leaving the backstretch, remained wide into the lane, finished willingly through the final furlong but had to settle for second best. MISTER ICEMAN dueled
inside SIR ATTICUS, lost touch with that rival outside the eighth pole and flattened to third. RIFEY broke a step slow then lacked early speed, passed rivals
on the turn, came six wide into the lane and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. HARD TO FIGURE hit the gate in the beginning, raced in
range then lost ground on the turn, came two wide into the lane, moved out in the drive and improved position. TOUCHDOWN BROWN settled in the early
going, spun five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. PRINCIP bobbled leaving the gate, stalked four deep early, chased three to four wide on the turn,
drifted in upper stretch then came in further at the eighth pole to bother rivals and could not rally. DEPARTURE stalked off the inside then had to pause at
the seven-sixteenths pole, lost ground around the bend three to four wide, got crowded between foes at the eighth pole and weakened. KINGDOM HEART
stumbled leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival, altered course at the eighth pole and failed to rally. DEL MAR JERRY broke a step slow, stalked from
inside, was forced to check midstretch and weakened. REIQUIST brushed outer rival at the start, climbed up the backstretch, dropped back to last around
the bend, raced four wide into the drive and came up empty. DIVEMASTER was off slow and bumped at the start, exited the bend three wide and failed to
make an impact.

Footnotes
TWIST (FR) stalked the pace from inside, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared then started to lug out with a quarter mile remaining,
continued to lug out in the stretch but was able to hold safely in the end. YES THIS TIME brushed leaving the gate, unhurried in the early going and moved
inside, gained along the fence through the far turn, tipped out in the lane, closed determinedly but could not reach the winner. CROSBY BEACH got bumped
on both sides and crowded at the start, steered to the inside racing near the back, went two to three wide on the far turn, tipped out then altered back inward
in upper stretch, showed a mild response and gained the show honors. FLASHIEST raced off the rail then outside a rival towards the rear on the clubhouse
turn, went four deep into the second bend, spun six wide into the lane and got outfinished for third. SEVEN CHARMS brushed with inner rival at the start,
angled to the inside while off the pace, moved into range leaving the backstretch, asked around the far turn and flattened in the furlong grounds. LURE HIM
IN raced in mid-pack a bit off the rail, took closer order between in the middle stages, chased two wide into the lane and lacked a bid. DON'T SWEAR DAVE
stalked off the rail, went three deep into the far turn, got shuffled back and angled in, then failed to find the needed response in the drive. BALLADEER
dueled from outside leaving the chute then ceded command to the pacesetter, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, got floated out by ASTRONOMER
at the three-eighths pole, traveled four to five leaving that bend and failed to produce a bid. MAJESTIC EAGLE chased widest into the stretch for the first
time, went four wide around the clubhouse turn, lost positions in the middle stages, had to alter course when TESORO was taken out wide at the
three-eighths pole, cut the corner into the stretch and failed to menace. ASTRONOMER bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, went up to duel from
inside then cleared, showed the way to the far turn, drifted out at the three-eighths pole, gave up command shortly after and retreated through the drive.
TESORO brushed at the start, allowed to settle three deep, eased out of the race at the three-eighths pole, stopped at the furlong marker and walked off.
