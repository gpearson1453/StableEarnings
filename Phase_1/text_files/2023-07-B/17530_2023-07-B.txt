IS THERE A FOREST set a pressured pace, had a slim lead on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch prevailed. WEST PAW was
unhurried early, saved ground on the turn, angled out through the stretch and rallied late. REIGN BY REIN was up close, a factor on the turn and vied to
deep stretch but was outfinished. SUBZERO PLUS forced the pace and dueled on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch needed more.
EASY ACCESS was in touch and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response.

PAPERBACK HERO was in touch, a factor on the turn, drifted out at the top of the stretch and proved best. LOQUACIOUS was in touch, hustled along on
the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. HIATUS set the pace and had the lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and
held show. PARTY OF NO stalked the leader and raced evenly on the turn but had no late kick. BEYOND MY DREAMS was off the pace and had a mild
gain on the turn but leveled off. LIL GREEN MACHINE was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but failed to fire. GLITTER MOUNTAIN was away
alertly but trailed the field on the turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT WARNING tracked the leaders from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and angled out in mid stretch to get up in time. LIGHTS AND SIRENS
showed speed from the outside and dueled on the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch was outgunned. TANGERINE TWIST was up
close, had a slim lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch but was outfinished. RUMOURS FLY was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and
from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. WICKEN CENTS was off slow, saved ground on the far turn and rallied late. LADY OF THE
FORT was unhurried early and in tight on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. LIGHTNING MARIE was in range and
raced evenly on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch leveled off. PRINCESS DIDI showed no speed and was hustled along on the far
turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no impact. LEA'S SUNSHINE was in touch and roused on the far turn but weakened. BELLE FEMME
was off slow and showed nothing while outrun. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUN INTO THE FAR TURN LEFT THE RESULTS AS POSTED.

VINNIE VAN GO set a pressured pace, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch drew off. ACE DESTROYER was away
alertly, had a good position on the turn and had a bid from the four path at the top of the stretch but was no match for the winner. COO BIRD was unhurried
early and was roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch finished evenly. EXCEED settled off the pace and was hustled along on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. WONNEFRAC was off the pace, trailed the field on the turn and from the three path at the
top of the stretch was no threat. RED MAPLE was up close and a factor on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

back, closed the gap on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for place. LOKI'S LIGHTNING was away alertly and a factor on the
turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. TEQUILAS MELODY was up close and had a good position on the turn but evened out.
ONLY AT MIDNITE was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. ALWAY'S ROSIE was in
touch and roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. PICK A PENNY was in mid pack and hustled along on the
turn but weakened through the stretch. SAGED ENERGY was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort. CLOSING BRIEF'S was in range but chased on
the turn and was empty.

BRIENNE OF TARTH was in range, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. TOTAL BETTY tracked the
leaders from the inside, was a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the three path in upper stretch but failed to hold. LOADED SECRET set a
pressured pace and had a slim lead on the far turn but gave way in mid stretch. MENAGERIE was in range and roused on the far turn but from the four path
at the top of the stretch had no kick. DONNARUMMA was up close and raced evenly on the far turn but weakened through the stretch. MISS MOLLY
LALOU forced the pace but chased on the far turn and had nothing left. MISS SCHILLER was unhurried early, trailed the field on the far turn and was never
a threat.
