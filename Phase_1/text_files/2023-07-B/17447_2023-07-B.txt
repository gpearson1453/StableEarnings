Footnotes
CALIFORNIA SAND JS set a pressured pace while three wide then drew off into the turn, was in a long drive and held sway in the end. RB RATHOWAYNE
was unhurried early and saving ground on the turn, rallied on the inside in the stretch and was gaining ground but was too late. RB HASHTAG was taken
back off the pace while inside on the backstretch, rallied two wide and challenged for the lead at the top of the stretch then flattened out in the drive. WMA
BIG BABY chased the early pace while two wide, dropped back before the turn and lacked a rally in the stretch. QUICK RAE AA was shuffled back at the
start then allowed to settled and was no threat. UPTOWN RINGOFFIRE trailed throughout. Race was hand timed.
