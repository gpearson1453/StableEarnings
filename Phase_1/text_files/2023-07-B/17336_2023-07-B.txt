Footnotes
LEG UP took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and dug
in under steady encouragement to hold off the challenge of THEWITCHISGONE, who settled off the pace in the two and three paths, bid off the rail
approaching the quarter pole, raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch before relenting. WINDSOR'S
TRACKER saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride leaving the
turn. SEAN THE HAMMER stalked the earlier pace from the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn but
showed little in the lane. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE stalked off the rail on the first turn, challenged nearing the three eighths pole but faded past the five
sixteenths. THUNDERINREADYRICK raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, though, weakened in the four path on the
far turn. SPARKLING SHIRE dropped well back from contention, showed no response leaving the first turn and was eased.

POWERED BY LOVE took the lead at the half mile pole and set a pressured pace through the backstretch, widened at the rail on the turn and was kept alert
to deep stretch. SOUL CATCHER hesitated leaving the gate and raced well back from early contention, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
entered the turn off the rail but was eased outward toward the top of the stretch, left the turn in the five path and got up for second later yards. LOVE IS
WICKED gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. GREATEST NOTION gave chase inside, raced boxed at the
heels Powered By Love past the five sixteenths pole but quickly resumed stride and rounded the turn at the rail, though, flattened nearing mid-stretch.
DIRECT PROOF gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. CANDY FOR JUBA gave chase and
raced off the rail on the turn, was eased outward leaving the turn and showed little further. DESTIN'S RAINBOW pressed the early pace but dropped back
toward the five sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the turn and weakened in the lane. BRADLEY DO RIGHT gave chase outside then weakened in
the six path on the turn. YOUTHFUL ENERGY bobbled leaving the gate and dropped well back. Christopher'sheart ran loose in the post parade and was a
late scratch.

raced at the rail on the far turn and was kept alert in the lane. COLONIAL ROAD tapered in and stalked two deep. picked up the chase past the half mile
pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and settled for second. CURB THAT TIGER settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole
and steadily improved from that point, rounded the turn in the three path but had little left in the lane. I SEE NOTHING saved ground, picked up the chase
past the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and showed little further. JUBAY veered out leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn
about the four path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. A BIT OF HARLOW saved
ground, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. TO THE TOP raced off the pace in the two and three paths and
showed little response through the backstretch. JUBA'S MOCHA veered out leaving the gate and was through early.

Footnotes
GILLIGAN stalked the early pace three wide, took the nod leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled with the edge from that point, raced clear
approaching the quarter pole, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn but angled out and made contact with We B Shackin in late stretch and
just lasted. HAPPY CHARLIE saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, angled to the seven path on the far turn and dug in
under steady handling from the head of the lane, was bumped out in late stretch and just missed the nod. ROYAL CRUSADER saved ground on the first
turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in through the stretch and just got up for third. WE B SHACKIN saved
ground, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced close two deep while between horses approaching the head of the lane, eased out into the lane and
dug in from that point but was bumped outward and into Happy Charlie in late stretch then pinched back approaching the wire. TOUGH TO TAME rounded
the first turn in the three path then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path,
swung to the outside into the lane and finished well to pass rivals widest. REY O REYES had the early lead inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and
gave chase into the backstretch, but dropped back at the rail nearing the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. FIVE STAR PHIL rounded the first
turn in the three path, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the four path of the far turn. TRINGALE stalked the early pace two deep
while between horses, took the nod at the nine sixteenths pole, was met leaving the seven sixteenths and gave chase from that point but weakened in the
three path of the far turn. PROTA settled close off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole then weakened off the rail on the far
turn. A Stewards inquiry and subsequent claims of foul lodged against the rider of Gilligan for interference in late stretch, lodged by the riders of We B
Shackin and Happy Charlie, resulted in the disqualification of Gilligan to fourth place.
