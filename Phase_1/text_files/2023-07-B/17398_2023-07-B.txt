Footnotes
MR RIGGER was sent to the front, set the pace while racing wide early, drew off for a long lead and held safely under mild urging. PRAIRIE WARRIOR
broke slowly, was taken outside, advanced to the turn, bid five wide and got up for place while no threat to the winner. RARE COIN raced close to the pace
early, fell back, bid along the rail on the turn and earned show. QUANTUM BULL was off a step slowly and was pushed out at the start, moved up inside, bid
three wide and came up empty. WATFORD saved ground, angled out for the drive and offered a mild bid to improve position. DAN WHO swung wide
leaving the turn, lacked a bid and failed to threaten. PAINTED SMOKE came out at the start and was outrun in an even effort. WILD FIREWATER was not a
factor. FLAG THE FOOTNOTE got away well, showed brief speed, stopped and was not urged late.

SAMBAS MARK was crowded at the start, advanced outside, rallied four wide into the turn, assumed command and drew clear. THRUTHESTORM came in
at the start, raced mid pack, bid five wide, found his best stride late and got up for place. MARKED MONEY broke out, raced mid pack along the inside, bid
four wide and finished well to earn show. LEAVE THEM BEHIND stalked the pace while racing inside, bid along the rail on the turn, was within striking
distance and hung late. SMARTSREALGOOD broke slowly and was crowded at the start, was carried out entering the turn, angled back in, closed well and
was crowded late. VALENTINO WHO was slow early, angled out into the turn and lacked a bid. NEW MEXICO JEREMY stalked the pace to the turn,
dropped back and gave way. NOSTRANGRTOTHERAIN set the pace to the turn, tired and gave way.
