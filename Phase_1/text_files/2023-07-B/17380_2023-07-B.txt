Footnotes
WILD TIME chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled on
the outside to get up for the win late. SILENT SAILOR tracked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the
three path coming around the bend and dueled to the wire to narrowly miss. COMO ESTAS led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path
around the turn, dug in in upper stretch and battled between horses from there, giving way late. BURN BOSS trailed the field up the backstretch, was floated
out to the five path coming around the bend and made no bid. BOYD RAM raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the four path, swung wider still
into the stretch and was empty from there.
