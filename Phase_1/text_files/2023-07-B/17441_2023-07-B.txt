MINISTER QUINN set the pace on the inside, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely inside, battled it out with BRICK TOWN to deep stretch, then inherited
the win. STELLWAGEN BANKER raced off the pace, chased three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied outside and closed the gap late.
WOOTDAREITIS stalked between rivals, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. EDMUND FITZGERALD tracked on the inside, then chased inside and tired.
I AM IT was outrun early and closed belatedly on the rail. BRICK TOWN stalked three wide, bid on the turn, led into the stretch, dueled with MINISTER
QUINN through the lane, then took a bad step and was injured in deep stretch and lost the rider, vanned off after. After a Stewards' Inquiry, the race was
declared official.
