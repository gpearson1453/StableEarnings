Footnotes
JUMP INTO SANITY prompted the pace two then three wide, surged under left handed urging through deep stretch and got up in time. SAUNTER stalked
the early pace along the rail, slipped through to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, shook clear in upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
KRISTIN set a pressured pace along the inside then two wide to the quarter pole then was outfinished. ANGEL'S DESTINY saved ground and went evenly.
SOLDAT TEMPTATION offered a mild bid three wide into the turn then leveled off. DUDE'S MIST DATE had brief speed. INSIDE GIRL dwelt at the start
and was never close. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
TURBIE pressed the pace from the start, drew on near even terms for the lead two wide past the quarter pole, was carried out to the six path by the leader,
drifted in through mid stretch while under a hand ride and edged clear late under strong handling. DREAM MUSIC away alertly, set the pace along the
inside, drifted to the five path entering the stretch while maintaining a narrow advantage, was forced inward passing the furlong marker giving up the lead
then couldn't handle the winner. UNDERCOVER LADY stalked the pace and went evenly three wide. VAVITE allowed to settle, rallied along the inside into
the stretch, was shut off causing her rider to check hard past the furlong marker then lost momentum. PLAYFUL SUMMER failed to menace. INDY LITES
trailed. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF DREAM MUSIC LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
TURBIE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TURBIE AND PLACED HER FOURTH.

menace. ACROSS THE AISLE trailed into the stretch then passed tiring rivals stretch. MUGSY MALONE split horses two wide leaving the first turn,
prompted the pace into the far turn then weakened. SEE SPOT RUN chased the pace two then three wide and gave way in the stretch. SAMMY'S SMILE

Footnotes
BREEZY MONEY pressed prompted the pace three then two wide, rallied to gain a narrow advantage before the furlong marker then drew clear under right
handed urging. LAZARUS PROJECT never far back, had a mild late rally two wide and got up for second. HAPPILEA broke in front, set a pressured pace
two wide then along the inside to the top of the stretch and was outfinished. JACK'S ADVANTAGE well placed, failed to respond. DEBDURITE pressed the
early pace along the inside and weakened in the stretch. MORE THAN GOOD hopped at the start and trailed.
