ELECTION INTEGRITY never far back, rallied in the five path through the stretch under right handed urging to make the lead late and edged clear under
strong handling. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS stalked the pace into the stretch, dug in in the six path and finished clear for second. CAN'T CRASHMYPARTY
unhurried early, found his best stride late two wide. JOSH'N battled for the early lead two wide, shook clear on the turn, set the pace past the furlong marker
then weakened. MARK'S BUDDY JACIN failed to menace. COUNCIL OF FOUR battled for the lead along the inside for five sixteenths of a mild, kept on
into the stretch then gave way. MY BUDDY MICAH dropped far back soon after the start, lost contact with his field, was distanced and walked off.

THE KID'S PRAYER bobbled at the start, prompted the pace two wide to the top of the stretch, assumed command then finished full of run to win going
away under confident handling. MY TWO JAKES stalked the pace along the inside for a half, drifted to the six path entering the stretch and rallied for
second. BROKEN JEWEL sprinted to the lead shortly after the start, set the pace along the inside to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. SNAZZY
trailed into the turn and founder her best stride late in the five path. VAMONOS PIACENTE failed to menace. HALO EFFECT with the second flight two
wide, lacked the needed response. ONE RICH KITTEN had brief speed.
