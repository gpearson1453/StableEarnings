NOWNOWDANCER vied for the lead, raced along the rail, set the fractions to her liking, led from start to finish. CALLING raced in the four path, stalked the
front runner from the outside of the second tier of competitors, maintained that position through out, did not have enough for the win today but ran a game
second. MEGANS MILLIONS vied for the lead, settled off of the pace, raced from the middle of the field, remained out in the six path, mildly gained late.
GRACEFUL STREET raced from off of the pace, shifted into the four path after the half mile pole, stayed wide through the turn and closed well in the
stretch. GAP DADDY was fractious in the gates. PREPAID SPECIAL raced six wide early on, shifted into the four path in the upper stretch, mild bid late.
SMILING ANGEL was off a touch slow, raced on the rail, improved into mid pack, and finished even. TENSAS CLEAR raced from mid pack, was in the six

for the win. PINCH HITTER vied for the lead, stalked just off of the leaders hip, raced in the two path, drew next to the leader at t he half, took over,
committed to the lead at the quarter pole, was caught late just missing for the win. EL GEMAR raced from the middle of the pack early on, took the rail and
saved ground through out, angled out into the five path after the eighth pole, continued to close gaining ground and was able to get up for third. MO TAP
was keen in the bridle in the first turn and had to be steadied, stalked the pace while racing behind the front runners, raced in between runners and finished
even. BIGTIME TEGRIDY vied for the lead, raced on the rail, set the pace, was joined by an outside competitor and matched strides, then faded. CHROME
RUN stalked the leader i the four path, shifted into the six path, circled in a set, then gave way. THUNDER ROAD trailed, improved late. LITTLE JONY was
no threat. MYSTERIOUS SPIRIT raced in the middle of the field, was in the four path, bid at the half, but to n o avail. FABLED RULER showed little.
