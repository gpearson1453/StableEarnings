Footnotes
SING SCAT , sent to the lead soon after the break, set the pace along the rail and was kept to his business in the stretch. SINGALONG saved ground the
first turn, moved up three wide leaving the far turn and continued to gain through the stretch. HAZELMOOR BEACH raced along the inner rail the first turn,
briefly steadied lacking room at the head of the stretch, worked between horses in upper stretch, rallied and returned bleeding. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM ,
three wide both turns, floated to the four path in upper stretch and rallied mildly outside horses. PROPER STORM lacked speed, swung very wide in upper
stretch and passed tired horses. LOTTACLASS LILSASS raced inside horses most of the trip and was not a factor. IRISH LACE chased the pace down the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the far turn and gave way. FASHIONATTA stalked the pace near the inner rail down the backstretch and on the
far turn then gave way in the drive. NANCY MY LOVE was outrun.

Footnotes
THUNDER LAD dropped in early while under some coaxing, advanced to the inside of foes leaving the three eighths, angled four wide making progress into
the lane, closed between runners while under left handed asking a sixteenth out, took over from FORCE OF JUSTICE in deep stretch and held firm. NEVER
GREW UP had his right hind shoe repaired in the paddock, broke a step slow, chased four wide outside rivals, circled five wide into the stretch, closed
gamely but was denied by the winner to his inside. FORCE OF JUSTICE , sent up inside rivals to take command, set a pressured pace towards the rail,
moved clear under solid encouragement into the lane, widene in mid stretch but gave in to the top pair very late. LADDIE DANCE prompted the pace
outside FORCE OF JUSTICE, was attempting to lug out a bit past the three sixteenths, came three wide for the drive and gave way grudgingly. DANCE
FOR GREEN , in the clear early, chased between foes mid turn, shifted in past the three sixteenths and came back some late. MALINOIS , a bit sluggish
from the gate, saved ground into the lane but lacked a serious run. DATS DATS DATS , urged along while off the pace, retreated through the drive.

Footnotes
STARSHIP LAOBAN , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, drifted very wide in upper stretch, took command under brisk urging near the sixteenth
pole then drew off. GOLDEN EFFECT prompted the pace outside BANDITS WARRIOR, bid for the lead in mid stretch, finished willingly but was no match
for the winner. BANDITS WARRIOR came in at the break, accelerated to the early lead, hugged the inner rail set a pressured pace and gave way the final
sixteenth. WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER bumped STILL MY BABE when bearing out at the break, raced in the two path between horses on the turn and was not
a factor. STILL MY BABE , bumped and caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, faltered and was eased. GASTOWN
BABE , done early, raced along the inner rail on the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
IRISH BANDIT sped clear early, set the pace three wide and under some nudging, kicked away under solid asking leaving mid stretch then was kept alert
as much the best. TOCAYO gave early chase three wide, dropped in to save ground around the turn, failed to make inroads past mid stretch, kept trying
and saved the place. UNCLE CHINITO pursued inside into the turn, came off the rail around the turn, raced two to three wide in upper stretch and continued
with interest. CATAHOULA MOON drifted in at the break bumping KINGDOM FORCE, secured the rail soon after, remained towards the inside and had
belated action. KINGDOM FORCE , bumped and in tight at the break, raced well back under a ride leaving the far turn, remained off the rail in upper stretch
then finished with good energy between foes. LUCKY DOUBLE DON broke a step slow, edged up three wide into the turn, circled four wide into the stretch
but came up empty. PURE REALIZATION was outrun.

at the wire. SUMMER ODDS , four deep around the turn, gained the lead in upper stretch, remained in front until deep stretch and just missed. BELLA
BETTINA , a forward factor near the inner rail around the turn, swung wide in mid stretch and closed nicely. HITCH A RIDE showed speed along the inner
rail, weakened the final furlong and angled out late. POLICE WOMAN raced in the two path around the turn and was not a factor. IMAGINE VICTORY ,
three wide on the turn, was outrun.

Footnotes
DELEGATED had his left hind shoe repaired in the paddock, edged up to a forward position early, saved ground stalking mid turn, eased out entering the
lane, closed in between rivals leaving mid stretch, sustained under right handed asks, took over in deep stretch and prevailed. MARGIE'S FUN SON was
steadied off heels near the five eighths, recovered and was pushed along to gain past the five sixteenths, angled six wide for the drive, gathered momentum
past the three sixteenths, switched over to his corrected and lead and finished gamely to just miss. DOWSING ROD sped to the front, set a rated pace
towards the inside, took some pressure around the turn, spurted clear two wide and under a drive in upper stretch, dug in when confronted nearing the
sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. MONEY ROOM , five wide between foes near the half mile marker, advanced four wide to take aim approaching
the stretch, ranged up in mid stretch then hung late. THE LAST JUMPSTART settled well back while saving ground, swung out to about the eight path in
upper stretch, straightened away and closed steadily. PRINS FIRE , four then three wide between foes, stayed in touch while under asking into the lane,
lacked a punch past mid stretch and weakened. INFINITE SERIES prompted the pace two to three wide outside the leader, failed to kick on soon into the
lane, was checked sharply off heels leaving the three sixteenths and faded. SWEET SYNTAX was taken up soon after the break then swerved inward,
regrouped to make a good run saving ground past the three eighths, eased out then back in for the drive and gave way. NOBLE RIVER hopped at the
break, edged up six wide outside rivals nearing the half mile pole, dropped in a bit leaving the far turn, lacked a kick past the five sixteenths and faltered.

I'M GITTIN THERE , rated behind horses on the turn, found ample room along the inner rail, swept to command in upper stretch and pulled away under a
hand ride. AMAZON QUEEN hugged the inner rail around the turn, was taken to the four path turning for home, chased the leader and weakened.
UNCORKED (AUS) assumed the early lead, was kept in the two path around the turn and gave way in the drive. TAP THE TITTLES , a forward factor in the
three path between horses on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. AZIZA , four wide around the turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
PARISH BELLE , quickly to the front, took to rating inside and turned away some early challenges entering the turn, spurted away and was nursed along
past the five sixteenths, was guided out a couple paths soon into the lane, opened up under some right handed asks then maintained a comfortable
advantage while confidently handled through the final seventy yards. NORTHERN GLOW steadied at the break, regrouped and was taken to rate, advanced
well in hand while two wide past the five sixteenths, dropped in to take the rail route into the stretch, advanced inside foes, came back out and finished with
good energy while second best. BRZINA , four deep nearing the half, was coaxed along four wide pursuing into the stretch, stayed on past mid stretch then
faded a bit late. MAMA G'S WISH edged up three wide between runners nearing the half mile pole, was under heavy pressure pursuing to the inside of
BRZINA nearing the lane, continued on past the eighth pole then faded. LA TRAVIESA settled in the clear early, angled in leaving the far turn, came back
out to be four wide for the drive but lacked a rally. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO , unprepared as the gates sprung, was off three to four lengths slow, raced well
back leaving the far turn, came out some in the drive and had belated action under steady hand encouragement. BETCHA BY GOLLY was sent up two wide
between rivals to briefly challenge with a half mile remaining, dropped in when failing to keep pace with the winner past the three eighths, remained in range
to upper stretch then gave way. There was a stewards inquiry into the start of FRECCIA D'ARGENTO. No action was deemed necessary.
