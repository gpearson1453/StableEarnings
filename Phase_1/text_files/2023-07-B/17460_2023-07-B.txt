Footnotes
CAN'T BE BROKEN stalked inside of foes from the two path, was nudged along rounding the turn, angled out to the six path turning into the stretch, and
rallied to be up in the final sixteenth. SERGEANT SINATRA was prompted along in the five path, loomed from the four path passing the quarter, ran on to
lead while back in the five path passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. LOST CITY set the pace in the three
path, was roused from the two path early around the turn, yielded to a pair of outer foes passing the eighth pole, but held show. GARY'S FLYING LION hit
the inner part of the gate leaving, travelled off the pace in the three path, angled out to the seven path in upper stretch, but was one paced. MIRO trailed in
the two path, was driven from said position into the stretch, but made no impact. SECRET SOLDIER rated in the four path, floated out around the turn and
was in the six path at the top of the lane, altered back inwards but was no factor. TAPIT'S DIRECTION tracked in the three path, was floated out to the eight
path in upper stretch, and did not threaten. NYQUEST NIX pressed in the four path, headed the leader from the three path passing the quarter, but
weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
OKIRO dueled along the rail, drew clear nearing the head of the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging and held clear. FULL NELSON bumped
REMINDER soon after the start, stalked the pace in the two path and stayed on to be clearly second best. REMINDER was bumped then shut off soon after
the start, raced off the pace two wide, tipped out in the lane and finished evenly to gain the show. BEAUTIFUL JANET dueled outside of the winner, dropped
back while drifting out nearing the quarter pole and was one-paced in the lane. JIGSAW chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. KARAOKE
tracked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. THE HONEYMAN trailed inside while trying to lug in throughout.

HARD TO FATHOM stalked in the four path, was roused into the far turn, bid and took the lead while still in the four path at the top of the lane, opened up
into the final furlong, and held clear under a drive. MEDIA SENSATION tracked in the five path, was coaxed from the four path into the far turn, urged while
back in the five path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. KINISON laid off the pace in the four path, was cued from the five path passing the three
eighths point, and kept on from the six path down the lane for show. TRUTH AND HONESTY set the pace in the three path, was nudged along in the two
path early around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. PAPA KATZ trailed in the three path and was no threat around the five path down the lane. ARTICO
rated in the two path but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO TOWN raced in range three wide, bid three wide between foes nearing the five-sixteenths marker, battled between through upper stretch,
seized command approaching the sixteenth pole and drew clear. IMMENSE FAITH stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, led
past the eighth pole and was second best late. ORGANIST bumped with VANISHING INTEREST at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide,
advanced outside down the backstretch, bid four wide nearing the five-sixteenths pole and was outkicked in the lane. BELLY OF JELLY saved ground off
the pace, went two wide around the far turn and was outfinished for the show. VANISHING INTEREST was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and
three wide and never threatened.. COOL MEMORY led early inside, chased inside down the backstretch and faded at the rail around the far turn.
RIVERBOAT RICHIE advanced three wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared midway around the bend, set the pace inside from there to the-eighths
pole then gave way.

Footnotes
LUNAR ROCKET raced prominently along the hip of the leader in the three path, bid approaching the final quarter, received a right handed cue while taking
the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch, and held sway. STRAIGHT SHOT got bumped between foes at the start, tracked in the two path, bid
between foes in the five path turning into the stretch, and chased on for place. THENORTHREMEMBERS bumped with an outer foe at the start, was hustled
off the pace in the two path, under left handed urging while tipping out to the four path into the lane, angled in while running on into the final sixteenth, and
got up for show. FORTY FLASH broke in and bumped an inner foe, travelled wellback in the three path, was under a heavy drive between foes in the four
path rounding the turn, shifted out to the seven path turning into the lane, and was gaining late. ETERNAL FLAME stalked in the four path, ranged up
around the turn and took aim from the six path entering the stretch, but flattened in the final sixteenth. TORETTO set the pace inside, was roused
approaching the quarter, but gaveway. ELUSIVE MISCHIEF rated in the five path but was no menace.

CHAINA stalked the pace four wide, closed between foes, took the lead late and just lasted. DON'T ANSWER was off slowly, chased the pace five wide,
closed outside and just missed. RED DOG raced off the pace in the two path, tipped out nearing the eighth pole, rallied between foes, was in somewhat
tight quarters pole and was outkicked. MR. RHODIUM pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and led between foes to
deep stretch. MIGHTY MIRACLE set a pressured pace in the two path, was collared near the eighth pole and fought on inside of foes to deep stretch.
RIGEL raced off the pace three wide, angled seven wide in midstretch and rallied belatedly. CHROME GHOST broke through the starting gate prior to the
start, checked off heels not long after the start and made little impact while racing mostly in the two path. LAS OLAS was outrun while racing five wide. AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF RED DOG AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN LATE STRETCH WAS NOT

Footnotes
FORTUNA BELLE set the pace in the three path, opened up slightly into the turn, was roused passing the quarter and floated out to the four path into the
stretch, lugged out passing the sixteenth pole, and held safe. MY LADY JAMES brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, moved up
around the turn, was cued from the five path at the top of the lane, and chased on for place. CHLOE'S TOY prompted the pace inside, lost ground while
under a ride in the two path rounding the turn, and finished evenly in the stretch for show. VAI BELLA was behind in the two path early, fanned out to the
seven path into the stretch, and stayed on. NO ACTION travelled off the pace in the three path and did not factor from the five path in the stretch. ACTION
ROSE rated inside but never threatened. DRUM ROLL brushed with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path but faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
WILDCAT LUNITA set a clear pace in the two path and widened under a drive. THANK THE ACADEMY had her head turned at the start, raced very wide
down the backstretch, made strong progress four wide around the turn, was no match for the winner but held clear of the rest. SOPHIA LAUREN tracked the
pace two and three wide, was no match for the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the show. SHARP PIPPA was up close between foes and
steadily faded while racing two and three wide thereafter. OVERRUN failed to menace while racing two wide. EXAGERADORA hit the starting gate, chased
the pace inside and faltered around the turn.
