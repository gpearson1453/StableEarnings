Footnotes
HEARTLAND veered in leaving the gate, chased from off the pace on the inside, began to climb on the turn while moving out to the two path, steered back
inside and passed rivals leaving the bend, rallied along the fence, collared SLIDER with a sixteenth remaining and drove clear. SLIDER got bumped
between rivals at the start, set the pace under pressure, dueled with A DAY TO REMEMBER through the turn and into the lane, inched ahead in upper
stretch, put away outer rival past the eighth pole but yielded to HEARTLAND in deep stretch. A DAY TO REMEMBER broke in and brushed SLIDER at the
start, pressed that rival up the backstretch, dueled around the turn, fought to the eighth pole and flattened to third. INVINCIBLE brushed FLIGHT WAY
leaving the gate, tracked two wide into the turn, three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. FLIGHT WAY broke slow and brushed in the
beginning, trailed four then three wide around the bend and failed to menace. HEAD LAD brushed with SLIDER at the start, tracked outside a rival to the
turn, rounded the bend three then four wide and failed to rally.

Footnotes
CHERUBIC FACTOR lost his path early and dropped back off the pace, waited on the inside when boxed in on the turn, lacked room from upper to
midstretch, gained an opening on the inside with a sixteenth to go and surged ahead late. UNCONQUERABLE KEEN (IRE) bumped between rivals then
took hold up the backstretch, chased two to three wide around the bend, altered out in upper stretch, rallied seven deep and got outclosed by the winner.
STANDING O stalked from inside, launched a bid inside the top pair into the lane, took over past the eighth pole and got run down in the closing moments.
ZOFFARELLI (IRE) got bumped at the start, trailed on the inside into the turn, saved ground around the bend, moved out in the lane but could not find room
until the final sixteenth, then finished well once in the clear but was too late. ARMAN broke a step slow and bumped at the start, settled early, gained four
deep around the bend, bid six deep in the drive but got outkicked in the late stages. JOHNNY PODRES took a bump from outside early, stalked between
rivals and two wide around the bend, bid five deep in the lane but lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. EVENEREVENWORSE took control early
and showed the way up the backstretch, saved ground along the rail through the turn, challenged by GOLDEN ALE leaving the bend, relinquished the lead
in upper stretch but fought back between rivals before weakening late. GOLDEN ALE was closest in pursuit into and around the bend, launched a bid
leaving the turn, put a head in front in upper stretch, was overtaken midstretch and weakened. NABOKOV stalked four then three deep up the backstretch,
remained outside a pair of rivals into the lane and also weakened.

LORD PRANCEALOT cleared from outside and crossed over, showed the way unchallenged to the stretch, put to right handed urging in the lane and
padded under steady handling in deep stretch. LAST CALL PAUL got bumped from outside at the start, stalked from inside into the turn, tipped out leaving
the bend to take at the winner, could not summon the needed late kick and stayed on to secure the place. MR. CHIVAS tracked five deep early, four then
three wide around the bend, raced within striking distance entering the final furlong but flattened out. JUST A GUESS unhurried from inside, saved ground
through the turn, gained a minor award but needed to find more late to threaten. HAVOC broke a step slow and got bothered at the start, chased near the
back off the rail, got floated out on the turn and improved position in the stretch. DANCE MAN chased four deep between rivals, got bumped and crowded at
the half-mile pole, altered around rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole and could not rally. HELEN'S SUN veered in to bump rival leaving the gate, chased
between foes then got put in tight on the turn, angled to the inside and failed to menace. ONLY ONE AMERICA chased three deep early, got crowded and
bumped at the half-mile pole, chased two wide early on the turn, angled four wide into the lane and weakened. FACT OR FICTION came away slow, lagged
behind and never got involved. EPISODE FIVE was closest in pursuit to the turn, went wrong approaching the five-sixteenths pole and was pulled up and
walked into the van following the race.

Footnotes
WHISTLER'S STYLE stalked five then four deep around the clubhouse turn, bid three deep at the midway point, dueled on the outside and took over on the
far turn, cleared past the quarter pole and drew off. RENEGADE PRINCESS broke a step slow, had to pause when rival crossed over shortly after, chased
five wide into the turn then moved in a few paths while going up to apply pressure, prompted the pace between at the half-mile pole, chased the top pair
around the far turn, came three wide into the lane and finished willingly to regain the place. PENS STREET forwardly placed three then two wide early, got
boxed in from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths then gained an opening and was coaxed along on the far turn, altered out from behind rivals with
a furlong remaining and was along for the show. RACE JUDICATA cleared and crossed over early, gained company around the clubhouse turn, set a
pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled with WHISTLER'S STYLE on the far turn then failed to keep up with a quarter mile remaining and weakened in
the drive. AGREETODISAGREE bumped with outer rival at the start, settled four wide early, continued wide through the far turn and entered the stretch five
wide and could not rally. BANDEENA got put in tight between rivals early, tucked inside at the back, saved ground to the stretch and improved position.
AWESOME TAYLOR stalked four then three wide outside rivals on the first turn, ridden along three deep on the second bend and lacked a rally.
JACRODRA'S DEVIL bumped rival shortly after the start, became rank into and around the first turn, paused when bothered by inner rival at the
seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. LUCY L stalked the pace from inside, lost
ground around the far turn and faded in the lane. TALKATIVE GAL got bumped from inside shortly after the start, chased three deep into the first turn then
got put in tight early on the bend, raced near the back off the rail into the second bend and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ANGIOLLETA (IRE) broke a step slow, settled off the pace, lacked room in traffic on the far turn then tipped out into the clear, angled in at the top of the
stretch, rallied from inside and proved best late. LOTERIE (IRE) was off slow to begin, raced on the inside near the back early, lacked room on the far turn,
altered in then back out around that bend, angled to the inside in the stretch and rallied for the place. ROSCOE VILLAGE tracked two wide early, raced
between foes two then three wide on the far turn, bid three wide leaving the far turn, fought three deep into the final furlong and got outkicked. PINK
WHITNEY tossed her head and came away slow, trailed on the inside early, checked when having her path taken near the quarter pole, steered out into the
lane and finished well. BLUE OASIS away quickly in the beginning then stalked a bit off the rail then along the fence on the first turn, bid two wide at the
five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead with a quarter mile left to run, held a short lead over rivals on both sides entering the furlong grounds and yielded in deep
stretch. AURATIUM got crowded along the rail early, settled in mid-pack on the inside, found traffic on the far turn, chased two wide into the lane and could
not rally. TURF ROCKET chased outside a pair of rivals off the pace in the early stages, bumped inner rival four deep on the far turn, launched a bid four
wide leaving the far turn, could not keep up in upper stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. STORMY GAL broke a step slow then rushed up to take
over before clearing on the inside, challenged around the far turn, lost the lead approaching the quarter pole and gave way. WOK DON'T RUN stalked
outside a rival, got bumped and crowded between rivals midway around the far turn and faded. KEEPYOURPRANCEON broke a step slow, tracked two
wide between rivals, steadied at the nine-sixteenths pole, angled four wide and came up empty.

the lane, loomed from outside entering the final furlong but faltered in deep stretch. BLACKENED took control quickly, set the pace inside a pair of rivals to
the turn, vied along the rail around the bend, dueled in upper stretch and in the late stages. ILA VEIW TOO raced up close outside the top pair, vied three
deep around the turn and flattened in the stretch run. PARCO stalked from inside then a bit off the rail into the lane and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE HY stalked two wide early, bid three deep into the stretch, cleared with a furlong remaining and held well. IMPACT WARRIOR (IRE) tracked two
wide outside a rival, came three wide into the lane, took aim at the leader in the furlong grounds but had to settle for second best. GIMME MO BABY tracked
along the inside, moved a bit off the rail on the far turn then altered back inside at the top of the stretch, angled out in the lane and got up for the show
honors. SUNSHINE BABE reserved along the inside, cut the corner into the stretch, waited for room in upper stretch, gained a clear path approaching the
sixteenth pole, finished well from inside and missed the show. SPEED LANE was closest in pursuit from the two path early on, bid two wide leaving the far
turn but was no match in the final furlong. PEGS A. K. GIRL took control early and moved inside, pressured from outside past the quarter pole, lost
command in upper stretch and weakened. WITH LOVE (GB) traveled two wide off the pace, moved out and entered the lane four wide and failed to
threaten. PLEASANT WAVE reserved in the early going on the inside, trailed two wide into the lane and improved position. SHOCKING GREY chased three
wide around the clubhouse turn, angled five wide into the lane and failed to menace. LA DEUXIEME ETOILE rated on the inside early, chased a bit off the
rail into the lane and weakened. REBEL GIRL settled inside, tipped three wide on the far turn and lacked further response. LADY JAE raced two wide near
the back early, steered out on the far turn and exited that bend four wide and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
THE CHOSEN VRON settled three wide, checked off heels early on the turn, moved out one lane to avoid trouble, came back in later on the turn then two
wide into the stretch, engaged leaders in upper stretch, dueled inside rivals most of the drive then determinedly inched away in final yards.. ANARCHIST
taken just off the leaders early, tracked in four path and between foes, was three or four wide around the turn came four wide, joined leading pack, dueled
between rivals through the drive and lost narrow decision outside the winner. DR. SCHIVEL angled in early. stalked three wide into the bend, advanced
widest of all and was caught six wide exiting the turn, joined leaders from the outside, battled three abreast through the drive but was turned back in the final
yards. KID CORLEONE prompted the early pace, checked momentarily nearing the turn, dropped back a bit, re-rallied inside, found clear path along the rail,
moved up and grabbed brief lead leaving the bend, relinquished that lead past furlong marker but still fough gamely and only gave ground grudgingly late. C
Z ROCKET hopped slightly at the start then dropped far back in the early going, continued well behind around the turn, continued three wide to the stretch
and found his best stride late from well off the rail. AMERICAN THEOREM settled off the rail, moved out to avoid trouble of SPIRIT OF MAKENA leaving the
backstretch, advanced some while four then five wide around the turn, remained outside and finished strongly. SIBELIUS prominent early from the outside,
traveled four wide and outside runner-up around the turn, came five wide and between foes into the stretch then weakened in the drive. HOIST THE GOLD
settled inside, hugged the rail into the stretch chasing the pace, remained inside late and also weakened. GET HER NUMBER off half length slow, slow into
stride and quickly dropped back, settled well back on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn, coaxed late on the turn, asked twice left handed and
made no headway. PEACEFUL WATERS away cleanly, went to vie for lead on own power, vied for lead three wide, took advantage of trouble inside and
cleared early on the turn, continued clear heading into the stretch, quickly swallowed up in upper stretch on both sides, failed to switch leads and retreated.
TODO FINO (CHI) away cleanly, vied for lead along the inside, continued to vie for command with a pair of rivals, heading into the turn brushed on hind end
by KID CORLEONE which resulted in trouble cornering and lugging and had to be taken up by rider which caused a chain reaction, after the trouble was not
preserved with in the lane. SPIRIT OF MAKENA off slow and lost path at the start, advanced in between rivals, sensing danger rider eased out into the three
to four path heading into the turn, and ended up having to steady due to TODO FINO taking up and THE CHOSEN VRON backing right into SPIRIT ON
MAKENA'S path, rider briefly lost balance when lugging out and was not preserved with after the rough going on the turn.

Footnotes
WATSONVILLE saved ground chasing the leaders, advanced on the final turn, waited slightly nearing the stretch, swung out for room, drifted in a bit in
upper stretch, came back out, responded under right hand urging and reeled in inside rivals late to be along in time. CHAY'S TORNADO stalked in the three
path, remained on same path into the stretch, advanced and challenged in deep stretch and between rivals and got up in final jump for second. SMOOTH
SALUTE bumped with inside foe at the break, was closest in pursuit to final turn, moved up and challenged past quarter marker, gained lead, inched away
in drive, dug in approaching the finish but could not hold off the winner. CARIBBEAN KING bumped at the start, chased either along the rail or in two path,
roused entering the stretch, came out slightly past eighth marker and held for minor award. HULA CANDY bit squeezed and forced to check in opening
strides, chased inside, waited behind rivals on the final turn, remained inside, found traffic again and blocked behind foes in the drive before angling out late.
BRING HIM HOME angled over early, chased three wide then between foes later and lacked needed late reponse. PRECISION STRIKE bumped with
outside rival at the start, chased between foes or three wide and lacked needed late reponse. UNCLE OSCAR broke out, off slow, dropped back to save
ground, entered first turn in the two or three path, continued on same path on backstretch, began to pick off rivals while in the four path midway through the
turn, entered lane very wide, drifted in mid stretch and made mild improvement. NOBEL GARY away cleanly, easily cleared rivals under own power into the
turn, continued clear on the backstretch setting reasonable fractions, continued clear into the turn, headed by SMOOTH SALUTE heading into the lane, took
up approaching the eighth pole when a rallying CARIBBEAN KING took his path, after that steady, coasted in to the wire. STONKS broke in and brushed
with PRECISION STRIKE at the start, settled off the pace on heading into the turn, stalked leaders three deep on backstretch, swung six wide into the lane,
asked right handed and had no response. UNUSUAL ACTIVITY tossed head and came away slow, lugged in to the open space, few green strides early,
finally settled into a rhythm on the turn, sat well off the place and on the rail on backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn, asked couple times left
handed in upper stretch but failed to respond.
