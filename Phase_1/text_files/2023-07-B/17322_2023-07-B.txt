Footnotes
PORTAGE stalked the pace on the outside, took the lead passing the seven-sixteenths, dropped from the three path to the two path on the turn, was
challenged to her outside before the five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, shook clear inside the three-sixteenths, was
put to a right-handed crop while remaining on her inside lead at the furlong marker, continued under the crop until near the sixteenth-pole then was placed
under a hand-ride while remaining on her inside lead to the finish but was best. STUNNINGLY settled off the pace, moved out inside the five-eighths pole,
was roused late on the backstretch, shifted from the two path to the four path on the turn, chased outside under a right-handed crop in upper stretch,
switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker and flattened out while well clear for the place. REVOLVING CREDIT broke in and brushed the gate,
settled towards the rear, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, was urged along in the two path on the turn and got up for the show while no threat to the top
two. SISTER MAHA went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was headed at the seven-sixteenths, vied inside on the turn, dropped back
near the five-sixteenths and tired. MS. SOLVEIG dropped back on the outside then was urged along at the rear, went four wide on the turn, dropped to the
three path into the stretch and was no factor. FEATHERING broke a half-step slow, angled out towards the rear early, moved up in the field then shifted
further out around the nine-sixteenths, chased four then three wide early on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on
even terms for the lead, drifted in while weakening coming to the furlong marker and capitulated. DARK PRINCESS was well placed just off the pace,
dropped back quickly near the half-mile pole, faltered along the rail on the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
ANTONIO OF VENICE coaxed from the gate, raced three wide off the duel advancing to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three to four
wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. CATIRE VIZCAYA hustled from the gate, dueled from the two path with ASTRONOMICO to his
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch displaced from the front, ran on to chase the winner home
willingly for the place honors. HONEST AL coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide
into upper stretch, improved position to secure the last major share. ASTRONOMICO hustled from the gate, dueled along the inside of CATIRE VIZCAYA
coming under coaxing from three furlongs out, cut the corner into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. GROUP TICKET coaxed from the start, chased
three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into

Footnotes
HIGHLY FLAMMABLE dropped to the rear while awkwardly into stride, settled at the tail of the field, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied outside
into upper stretch, closed strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then kicked clear and maintained a safe advantage under steady handling.
SUGAR GRAY LEONARD settled towards the rear, raced between foes in the two path on the turn, jostled with a rival outside the five-sixteenths, was
roused near the quarter-pole, bumped with DESTIN'S MISSION while kept in by that foe at the three-sixteenths, waited while blocked from that point to the
furlong marker then altered out for room, had the winner get the jump on him in the process, picked up his stride coming to the sixteenth-pole and finished
with good energy but lost his best chance at the victory while up for the place. KING JAMES went to the front, showed the way with some company to his
outside, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong
marker and was outfinished then lost the place while just able to get the show. WAR TERMINATOR was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, jostled with an opponent outside the five-sixteenths, was put to a drive with a clear rail opening in upper stretch, gained to make a brief bid along the
rail at the furlong marker but was out-kicked then just missed the show. SANDRONE was urged along while pressing the pace on the outside, drew even
with the leader in the two path on the turn, battled side by side with that foe under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. DESTIN'S MISSION brushed
with a rival at the start while last away, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the turn, bumped with a foe while between
horses in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired.

Footnotes
PRETTI XTREME four then three wide in pursuit, advanced to take over command at the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung four wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the very late stages. HALO CITY chased three to four wide coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along clear of the rest and second best.
GREATEST LOVE grew detached at the tail of the field and tucked to the two path into the backstretch, came under urging at the three-eighths, continued
just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. MARIAH'S FORTUNE hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand
along the inside, floated to the two path with nine-sixteenths to run, got overhauled by the top one at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch
and tired. WITH THIS VOW hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide for home,
faltered. GOOD PENNY hustled from the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coaxed along from
the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
CRAZY MASON disputed the pace on the outside, vied in the two then three path on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, drew off while
remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole
just before being given one pop of a left-handed crop and proved much the best under a strong hand-ride from that point to the finish. CROWN THAT SAINT
chased the pace down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was roused for more at the quarter-pole, moved out in pursuit of the winner in
the stretch and was second best. UNCLE EDDIE disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back coming to the
quarter-pole and tired while best of the rest. THREEWHITESOLDIERS was bumped hard at the start, raced on the outside while ridden along, angled in late
on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out into upper stretch and failed to threaten. ROCK STAR BOY was sent hard from the gate, chased
the pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, dropped back near the quarter-pole and capitulated. MAYOR JACK broke out and bumped
hard with a foe, settled on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path for most of the turn then shifted three wide, came five wide
into the stretch and failed to respond. BALANCE SHEET had a shoe repaired in the paddock, was last to commence, raced off the pace under urging, went
three then four wide on the turn and faltered.

KODIAC WINTERGREEN (IRE) coaxed from the gate, tracked just off the inside from mid pack, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three
wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths inside the three-sixteenths forcing DANCING NANCY to pause in behind her and then herding out LAMORNA
very slightly before being corrected, rallied into contention a sixteenth from home, then surged late to get up in the last jumps to the finish. EVER SO
SWEET (IRE) coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in
the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in under a drive under late threat, then got overhauled in the final strides by the top
one while preserving the place honors on the wire. PARADE RING (IRE) a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, was backed out and reloaded, chased
along the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive, then came
under a very active right handed rein and came inwards bumping NEOM BEACH solidly off stride just outside the sixteenth marker, came in again, the rider
continuing to go to the right handed rein encouragement nearly using it as a crop and brushed with that same foe seventy yards from home before prevailing
in the battle for the show honors. LAMORNA got squeezed at the start when IMPUDENCE broke inwards and KODIAC WINTERGREEN held his lane and
was away last, chased two to three wide from near the rear of the field coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, got
slightly herded out as KODIAC WINTERGREEN tipped out along her inside inside the three-sixteenths and then offered up a mild kick to close in late.
NEOM BEACH stumbled at the start and was bumped by GEMOFAPERFORMANCE breaking in a step, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the
leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive prominent inside the eighth pole and was
bumped solidly by PARADE RING coming in under right handed encouragement, paused briefly absorbing the shock when knocked off stride just outside
the sixteenth marker, then got brushed seventy yards from the finish when that same rival continued coming in uncorrected and lost position in the late
stages to the wire. GEMOFAPERFORMANCE broke in at the start bumping NEOM BEACH, chased three then two wide, got roused cutting the corner into
upper stretch and offered no response. DANCING NANCY two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, paused in behind KODIAC WINTERGREEN when that foe tipped out in front inside the three-sixteenths and stayed on one paced to the end.
SAN PANTALEO coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
weakened in the late stages. IMPUDENCE broke in at the start squeezing out LAMORNA against KODIAC WINTERGREEN, came under coaxing and
chased along the inside, got placed to urging at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and made no headway. RAICHU struck the off side stall at
the start, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into
the stretch run focusing on the incident between PARADE RING and NEOM BEACH at the sixteenth pole before the result was allowed to stand and the
race was declared official.

Footnotes
ITSALLCOMINTOGETHA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled through sensible splits, got set down taking the
inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, came under challenge inside the final sixteenth, dug in and held well to prevail.
RAMBLIN' WRECK tracked the pace just off the inside from mid pack, tucked inside when placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside
route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive tipping out to nudge VACATION DANCE to the three path in front of WILLINTORISKITALL just outside the
eighth pole, then rallied closing well to challenge for it all through the final sixteenth but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. VACATION DANCE coaxed from
the gate, tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got
nudged by the aforementioned foe tipping out near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages while just holding for the show honors.
WILLINTORISKITALL three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, got paused in behind
VACATION DANCE when that foe was nudged out in front by RAMBLIN' WRECK near the eighth pole, angled inside of VACATION DANCE, then kept on
under his own power and was out-finished for the show honors. TWENTY SIX BLACK three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MAMA BANNED ME broke a beat slow without incident getting away last and quickly growing
detached at the tail of the field when sluggish early and under urging, chased two then three wide before tucking inside into the far turn, came under a drive
at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.
