Footnotes
DUNPHY broke outwardly dictated terms early on, built a clear advantage nearing the turn, showed the way well in hand while taking the bend in the two
path, widened his margin entering the lane and sealed the deal under a drive while hanging on his left lead. MY BROTHER CHARLIE leaned out and
bumped a rival while off a step slow at the start, tracked from off of the pace in the four path around the turn, bid for place turning for home gained that
position nearing the furlong pole before changing to his right lead leaving that marker, then narrowed the leader's margin while proving second best. I
FEELUCKY TONITE chased along the inside, but gave way around the turn before surpassing an outer tiring rival in the late stages. PROFESSIONAL
GRADE pressed outside of the pace setter early on, but failed to keep pace nearing the turn, chased in the three path around the bend before meeting an
outer challenge for place turning for home, lost that position while requiring rider's assistance to change leads at the furlong grounds and weakened. RUN
CECIL broke inwardly and over a length slow, lagged behind the rest despite mild right handed reminders from the rider approaching the turn, then was
pulled up around the bend and vanned off.

NORDIC LIGHT stalked three wide, tugged forward entering the backstretch to vie with a pair of inner rivals at the eleven sixteenths pole, sparred two wide
while remaining in the three path entering the far turn before an outer rival joined the fray, got headed by that one at the quarter pole, yet fought on to regain
an advantage at the furlong grounds and fended off his outer counterpart thereafter. LONGSHADOW tracked along the inside, shifted out at the five furlong
pole, bid outside of the top pair and from the four path at the three furlong pole, led in the five path turning for home, but failed to kick away from an inner
NORDIC LIGHT entering the lane, relinquished the advantage back to that one at the furlong grounds and was kept at bay through the late stages. HEY
BOSS broke a step slow and raced at the rear in the four path, shifted inwardly in the final furlong and moved up. SANTA CRUISER prompted the pace
along the inside before deciding to shift outside of an outer rival approaching the backstretch, re-bid two wide and between horses with eleven sixteenths to
go, cleared an inner faltering foe approaching the far turn, but was headed by a pair of outer rivals at the three furlong pole, yielded to them turning for home
and weakened through the lane. BOLDISH laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three, then five, path and failed to menace before
being vanned off post race. CRIMINAL DEFENSE lacked speed two wide and between horses, trailed in the three path around the far turn before fanning to
the six path turning for home and got outrun. EASY BIG BOY set the pace while crossing over to the inside nearing the backstretch, vied with a pair of outer
bidders leaving the eleven sixteenths pole, but weakened with a half mile to go and was done early.

Footnotes
KING ME vied along the inside, dueled with an outer rival while a path off of the inner rail around the turn, inched a very narrow advantage in midstretch as
the long battle persisted, and gamely prevailed. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS took a brush from an inner rival at the start, vied three wide, dueled two wide while
in the three path around the turn, gamely sustained the war with his inner counterpart through the lane but was denied. AUTOCRAT prompted between the
leading pair early on, failed to keep pace at the half mile pole, chased along the inside around the bend, kept on well to vie for show in the closing stages
and gained that position late. MOUNT KISCO brushed an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace three to two wide and between horses around the turn,
gained show among rivals leaving the three sixteenths pole, but met an inner challenge for that position in the final furlong and got bested. OWN THE FIELD
raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, backed out at the three furlong pole, fanned five to six wide turning for home and offered a mild kick.
RATE CONFIRMATION was fractious in the starting gate, then broke a bit awkwardly, was hustled to maintain inside tracking position into the turn, but
failed to sustain that position at the half mile pole, shifted off the inside entering the lane and lacked a kick aiming between horses. ZAPHOD leaned in and
bumped the inner half of the gate upon leaving it, tracked while off of the pace four wide, but gave way in the five path in the lane. PASS LINE stalked the
leaders from the three path, but yielded in the four path in upper stretch before weakening between horses in the final furlong. ACE THE RACE leaned in
and shied from an inner rival while exchanging light contact at the start, then failed to factor well back in the two path. FLINT EAST WOULD broke inwardly
after hesitating multiple lengths at the start, trailed in the four path and showed litlte.

Footnotes
OLGA ISABEL set the pace inside of a pressing foe while remaining multiple paths off of the inside, kicked away from that one entering the lane and drew
off under driving pressure. PIGALLE tracked in the five path, was roused in hopes of gaining on the top pair around the far turn, then ran on outside of foes
to gain place at the sixteenth pole. EAST SHORE was last away, lacked speed in the two path and surpassed an outer rival to gain show late. AIN'T
BROKE tugged approaching the backstretch to prompt the pace outside of the leader, sustained pressure while kept in the four path by that rival around the
far turn, yielded entering the lane and weakened between horses in the final furlong. HOTHEADED PRINCESS raced at the rear in the three path and never
got involved.

Footnotes
HOWBOUTDEMAPPLES bobbled a bit at the start, prompted the pace two wide, vied in the three path around the far turn, led turning for home, inched
away in the final furlong before meeting THE CLUB's outer challenge in the late stages and held to the wire. THE CLUB pursued from midpack in the four to
three path around the first turn, saved ground while tracking around the far turn, gained show from outer rivals entering the lane, tipped outside of the top
pair at the furlong grounds, sustained a grinding charge to range up to the leader in the closing stages but ran out of ground. CHARLEE O set the pace
inside of a prompting foe, vied with that one before being headed at the five sixteenths pole, fought on well through midstretch, but gave way in the final
sixteenth. GHOSTLY GIRL settled off of the pace along the inside, spun into the lane just off the inner rail and ran on willingly to improve past outer rivals.
MINT EDITION stalked three wide and weakened in the five path in upper stretch. CARIBBEAN NIGHT laid off the pace two wide, fanned to the six path
entering the lane but lacked a rally. BEL ARIA tracked while tucking from the three to two path around the first turn, pursued inside of a rival while remaining
in the two path around the far turn, shifted out to the four path straightening four home, but lacked a kick and yielded. CLOUDY BAY bumped the gate while
rank at the start, trailed in the two path, took the far turn in the four path before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, but came up empty. I FEEL THE
NEED broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path and got outrun around the far turn before cutting the gap on the rest in the lane.

Footnotes
RIPERTON prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, led nearing the lane and held sway from an outer pair of chasers while hanging on her left
lead. GRACE GIVEN leaned out at the start, tracked in the four path and between horses around the turn, ranged closer entering the lane to take aim
outside of foes in upper stretch, but failed to offer a bid in the final furlong and edged place. SAVANNAMARIE tracked along the inside, shifted three wide
and between horses in upper stretch to set her sights on the new leader, but only managed to chase that one along with an outer rival through the final
furlong and got outkicked by that one for place. IUKA MISS broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path and moved up between tiring rivals in the
final sixteenth. SIMPLY STRIKING set the pace inside of a pressing foe, vied with that one around the turn, got headed at the quarter pole and readily
weakened. UMEBOSHI laid off of the pace in the five to four path, shifted to the six path entering the lane but failed to menace. SHAKE IT BABY got mildly
floated out by an inner rival at the start, stalked the leading pair from the three path, but yielded between gaining rivals entering the lane. FORESEEN
pursued from midpack five wide, but weakened while hanging on her left lead. ABOVE THE SUN broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside, improved
while fanning to the four to five path and between horses turning for home, then failed to factor while shifting inwardly in the late stages. SHE'S A SHOPPER
bobbled inwardly at the start, lacked speed in the three path, shifted to the five path around the turn and made little impact. HASINI broke outwardly, chased
from midpack two wide and among foes, but weakened into the turn, folded through the lane and was vanned off. BLAME THE GELATO broke a step slow
and showed little.

Footnotes
LADY GOLDSTART set the pace two wide, briefly cleared her inner counterpart nearing the turn, showed the way inside of a pair of bidders while remaining
a path off of the inside around the turn, sparred with CURRENT CLIMATE entering the lane, drifted out many paths while gamely clinging to an advantage
through the final furlong and held tenaciously. CURRENT CLIMATE prompted the pace along the inside, backed off to stalk at the half mile, re-engaged
outside of the leader along with an outer foe into the turn, bid in the three path at the five sixteenths pole to vie between horses turning for home, sparred
with only her inner counterpart entering the lane, but was herded outwardly many paths by that one while sustaining a duel through the final furlong and
missed at the wire. LAURA'S CHARM tracked along the inside, gained show from an outer rival while shifting ground outwardly at the furlong grounds, but
only managed to chase the embattled leading pair through late stages to prove best of the rest. STREET JAM laid off of the pace two to three wide and ran
on to gain fourth in the late stages. MADRILENA (ARG) stalked in the four path, bid outside of the leading pair around the turn, but weakened in upper
stretch. WILLOW BEND saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. PRINCESS ELIN laid off of the pace in the two path and faded. ABOUKIR BAY lagged
well behind the rest around the turn, shifted ground outwardly through the lane and cut the gap on the rest in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HERE MI SONG pressed three wide, gained an advantage at the three furlong pole, inched a clear margin with five sixteenths to go, held sway through
midstretch while hanging on his left lead, dug in to resist an outer challenge late and held firm. O BESOS tracked in the four path, moved forward to take
aim on the clear leader entering upper stretch, sustained gradual progress in the final furlong to ranged up and produce a bid in the late stages, but was
fended off. TUT'S REVENGE set the pace two wide and between a pair of pressers, got headed by his outer counterpart at the three furlong pole and
chased the top pair home through the late stages. CHASING TIME tracked along the inside early on, pursued two wide and between horses leaving the
three furlong pole, shifted out to the five path entering the lane and ran on evenly. SOLIDIFY trailed along the inside, surpassed an inner tiring rival at the
quarter pole but made little impact thereafter. GO WEST prompted the pace along the inside while under steady coaxing, but yielded at the three furlong
pole and weakened turning for home.

DRIANA set the pace along the inside, shook free of an outer presser entering upper stretch and held sway through the final furlong. HEARTSTRUCK
stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the clearing leader to take aim in upper stretch, but lacked a bid and fended off an outer rival for place. PHAT
CHANCE FANCY broke outwardly and brushed a foe, pressed two wide, but failed to keep pace with the leader while losing place and being floated three
wide entering the lane, then chased evenly. ANIMAL FRIES broke a step slow, tracked two wide, shifted four wide into upper stretch, but needed more to
produce a bid. EYES OF GOLD transferred contact from man inner rival to an outer foe while being floated out at the start, stalked three wide, but yielded
once floated five wide entering the lane. MY LILY MAE pursued from midpack in the four path around the turn, fanned six wide entering the lane and lacked
a rally. BLUE TOPAZ was brushed and floated out by inner rivals at the start, lacked speed in the five path around the turn, dropped back and shifted in
turning for home, but made little impact. HOLD MY HALO broke very slow and veered outwardly at the start, trailed along the inside and never got involved.
