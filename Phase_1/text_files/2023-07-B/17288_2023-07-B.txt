PASSION TO PLEASE was up close early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was much the best. BIG BANG
BLUE was off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. VERI UNIFIED was in range and
a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. JUNGLE TIGRESS was well back and saved ground on the turn but was
no real threat. FOREST CHOICE was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but weakened through the stretch. VERMONT HOLIDAY was in touch but
chased on the turn and faded through the stretch.

VERY DEBONAIRE showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch prevailed. PRINCE FOR A DAY
was in touch, raced evenly on the turn and vied through the stretch but just missed. RELOAD BULLET was away alertly and forced the pace on the turn but
from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. MISS D'S PRIDE was in mid pack and had a good position on the turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch leveled off. FIRST ROUND was off the pace and had a mild gain on the turn but needed more. RED ZEPPELIN was in range and roused
on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. BEYOND TALENTED was unhurried early, showed little and was no threat.

WILBERFORCE set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and with mild pressure through the stretch proved best. WORKIN OUT tracked the early leaders,
was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was clearly second best. SENSIBLE PORTIONS stalked the early leader, raced
evenly on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch held show. SYNCHROMESH was off slow and gained ground on the far turn but from
the six path at the top of the stretch was all out. DYNAMIC MISSION was in range but trailed the field on the far turn and from the seven path at the top of
the stretch had no rally. ACTION POINT was off the pace and had a mild gain on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.
ARTIE'S ALL IN was in touch and hustled along on the far turn but had no impact.

Footnotes
UNION COLONEL was hustled early, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held sway. EXCEED was unhurried early,
saved ground on the turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch rallied late. BOUND LUCKY was in range, had a mild gain on the turn and from
the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. ACE DESTROYER was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the five path at the top of the
stretch leveled off. WONNEFRAC was up close and raced evenly from the inside on the turn but had no late kick. BEN LOMOND was well back and closed
the gap on the turn but from the eight path at the top of the stretch had no impact. RED MAPLE was away alertly but in tight going into the turn and from the
four path at the top of the stretch weakened. TORPEDO MAX was off the pace and roused on the turn but was never a threat.
