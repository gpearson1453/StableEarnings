angled inside entering the stretch and lacked a closing response. MANFORALLSEASONS away last, chased wide through the backstretch, and was outrun.

WIZARDOFMENLOPARK hurried away then pressed four to five wide in the backstretch, fanned three wide in the far turn, loomed boldly at the head of the
stretch but was unable to stall the winner then finished up a clear runner up. BEAUTIFUL CALL chased from the back of the pack, rallied outside of PUNCH
PERFECT through the stretch and inched clear for show. PUNCH PERFECT chased inside, rallied with BEAUTIFUL CALL through the drive, and was worn
down for third. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL sat in range from the five path, dropped back through the final turn, and yielded. ENEMY LINES contested the pace
between rivals, and tired early.

BETTIN ON BELLE sat just off the pace outside, moved up alongside SAVYSKYE to contest the lead nearing the quarter pole, moved clear at the head of
the stretch and held. REBATE tracked inside, angled out to the four path, made a bid entering the stretch then dug in the final yards and missed.
SAVYSKYE saved ground while setting the pace, lacked the rally needed in the drive and weakened. ANNA'S IMAGE raced four wide into the opening turn,
chased three wide on the far turn, and faded. WILD RUNNIN MAGGIE reserved off the early pacesetters from the three path, and passed tiring rival into the
lane. THIS TIME SWEETIE went five wide into the opening turn, and was outrun.

SHAKEITFORMEGIRL tracked inside, found seam at the head of the lane then ran to the front and pulled away. STUBBORN LOVE stalked from the rail,
pressed the issue nearing the five-sixteenth pole, rallied between, and finished up second best. SASSY CINDERELLA sat just off the pace from the four
path, drove five to six wide into the lane, and flattened out late stretch. LILLY'S OF LONDON quickly went to the front, took pressure leaving the
backstretch, and came up empty in the drive. FAMOUS LAST WORDS sat midpack, and failed to threaten. SAYGE'S SPIRIT sat in range and was outrun.
SASSY MISS ELLIOTT was not a factor.

Footnotes
NICE GUY EDDIE sent for speed inside, gained an advantage over rivals leaving the backstretch, responded to threats in the final furlong, and drew clear.
TAPFERSURE returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment, rated off the early pacesetters, lacked running room inside near the quarter pole, and was
outkicked. SIX SHOTS OF T attended the early pace, chased wide in the final turn, and closed late earning show. ADIOS Y GRACIAS vied inside, chased
three-wide entering the lane, and was run down in the final strides. LIFES ADVENTURE attended the pace from the four path, drifted out in the final turn,
and flattened in the stretch. ALBERTA BERBON offered a late mild bid. TIMELY LIFE never reached contention.

Footnotes
LITTLE CHICAGO squeezed out leaving then saved ground inside, slipped through along the rail at the head of the stretch, grabbed the front at the
sixteenth pole and held safely. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH vied outside early, matched strides outside of HIGH KELLY SONG in the final turn, gained a slim
advantage but was out finished. SNAP COUNT rated off the pace while four to five wide, chased on the final turn outside, and closed gradually under steady
urging. TRICKY SPEEDSTER trailed the field early, closed outside, and flattened in the final sixteenth. HIGH FLYIN TIGER raced wide through the
backstretch, and lodged a mild late bid. HIGH KELLY SONG vied inside for the early lead, took pressure through the far turn, was unable to move on with
rival, and yielded late stretch. FLYING SUN chased the pacesetters and came up empty in the drive. VICTORY AT LAST chased inside early and gave way
late.

Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER quickly took command, was given her cue at the quarter pole, and opened up to an easy victory. FLORIST tracked inside through
the backstretch, drove between rivals at the head of the stretch, and rallied determinedly inching clear to secure the place finish. ADDYDIDIT trailed the field
early, lacked running room at the head of the stretch while in traffic, angled out, missed out on the seam that was taken by FLORIST, found room late
stretch, and finished gamely on the wire with DAZZLING MIST for show. DAZZLING MIST rated off the pace while outside, hustled off the final turn, chased
through the stretch then flattened out and settled to finish up third at the same time as ADDYDIDIT. QUICK DIAL stalked from the five path, roused at the
three-sixteenth pole, and gave way deep stretch. PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE sat just off the pace from along the rail, drifted in at the head of the stretch, and
retreated late stretch. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of ADDYDIDIT against the rider of PEARL OF KNOWLEDGE and FLORIST
alleging interference at the top of the stretch was not allowed after review by the Board of Stewards.
