Footnotes
SWEET SASSICAIA behind the pace inside, continued to track the leaders while saving ground turn, lodged a late bid inside the two leaders at the chute
gap with a sixteenth remaining, proved best under firm handling. FLOWERS APRIORITY broke alertly, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to
alternate for the advantage through the turn and into the straight, held a slightly larger advantage with a furlong to run, could not contain the winner, held
sway for the place while between horses at the wire. FIRE VISION away in good order, set or forced the pace in the two path and outside the runner up,
weakened a bit late, comfortably saved the show. DRIFTING MELODIES within striking distance while outside the dueling leaders, lacked a closing punch in
the drive. TDZ WHAT A DEAL broke back,moved up to race in mid pack off the inside, went one paced through the lane in also lacking a closing response.
ROARING QUINN back off the pace outside, came four wide for the drive, failed to muster a rally as well. BLUE RIDGE ROMANCE void of speed, made
little impact in remaining back. MY LITTLE MIA last to leave, was finished early. FUNKYLITTLESHACK broke through the gate prior to the start, broke back
then checked up in some traffic, raced back, steadied, shuffled back rail turn, did not recover stretch following a rough trip.

Footnotes
MOTATAABEQ behind the pace along the inside for a half, steered out in some traffic to be three wide into the lane, roused, challenged outside the leader
with less than a furlong remaining, floated out by that one late, proved best in a determined effort. JOLLY TOMMY pressed the issue early from the outside
up the backstretch, challenged four wide into the turn, took over, clear a furlong out, drifted out when challenged late by the winner, relented, remained clear
for the place. EYE DEE KAY broke back, continued to lack speed, four wide and between horses into the stretch, rallied for the show, no real threat to the
top two. LOUIS LE GRANDE pressed the issue early, challenged between horses through the turn, gradually weakened through the stretch to lose a couple
of positions. NORTHERNREFLECTION void of speed, five wide exiting the turn, went evenly the final furlong in lacking a closing response. COACH KENNY
with the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, challenged three wide and between horses turn, faltered in the drive. BIG MONEY MACHINE cleared
to the inside after an alertly start, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, vied along the rail through much of the bend then began to give way.
EASY TO MISS remained back in lacking a bid.

Footnotes
SUZY DOLL'S READY broke out a bit to bother MYDEALOFTHEDAY, was righted and raced in the second flight early, asked along three wide then
advanced on the leaders late in the turn, put a head in front past the furlong marker after drifting in a bit, found more late to hold the runner up safe in the
waning strides. SERAPE back off the pace well out in the strip, was roused five wide turning for home, late bid, not enough at the wire, narrowly gained the
place. AGGIE DOCTOR within striking distance off the inside, four wide exiting the turn inside the runner up, lodged a bid with less than a furlong remaining,
also could not get to the winner, narrowly missed the show. MARDI GRAS ALARM lacked speed, improved position while racing toward the inside.
MYDEALOFTHEDAY bothered at the start, trailed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SADIE'S RANSOM dueled up front
while in the two path, began to give way when straightened for home. JANISTHEBEAUTY set or forced the pace for a half along the inside and also faltered
through the stretch after helping set a quick opening quarter.

Footnotes
MARY JACK with the early pace outside, idled along when four wide into the stretch, continued to stall a furlong out, late push to be up in time. MISS
CHARLIE GRAS pressed the issue for three furlongs off the inside, took over in upper stretch, held the advantage late, yielded late to the winner while
inside that one. PEACEFUL VISION in mid pack early, advanced while being asked in the two path through the turn, lodged a bid between horses and
inside the runner up inside the furlong grounds, hung, missed nod for the place. SASSY EMMA lacked speed out in the strip, came five wide for the drive,
managed little in the way of any late gain. COUNTRY DREAM broke back, advanced five wide late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance the final
furlong. CUSTOM GUITAR went one paced in mid pack throughout in lacking a closing response. TAILORBESWIFT showed the way along the inside,
weakened when headed by the runner up in upper stretch. BEAUTIFUL ENDING off a step slow, void of speed for a half, picked off some tiring rivals while
never a threat. BE A BANDIT remained back in failing to menace. BOURN began to fade before a half. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY also staged a steady
retreat.

Footnotes
GEAUX SUGAR broke back, moved up to clear before a quarter, continued to show the way through the turn, extended that advantage into the lane, stayed
comfortably clear to the wire under steady handling. HALF OURS N STORMY lacked speed off the inside, came four wide for the drive, rallied down the
middle of the course to be up in time for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. TACTICAL PRIORITY within striking distance up the backstretch,
asked for run three wide through the turn, lost some ground to the winner into the lane, outkicked late for the runner up position. BUCK DOLL TAYLOR back
off the pace, continued back through the turn, in some traffic inside the furlong marker, shifted out a bit and improved position. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU
broke on top, relinquished the early advantage, chased the winner into and through the turn, had little left the final furlong. PINCH ME A PENNY in mid pack
for three furlongs, lacked a closing punch. SADIE'S LIGHT broke back and was never dangerous.

Footnotes
DEL MAR DRAMA bumped then steadied to be last away, moved up to midpack before a quarter while between horses, closer turn, challenged inside the
winner along the rail with just less than a furlong remaining, edged clear under steady handling. ALEXAPLAYBORNTORUN vied up front off the inside,
gained a larger advantage when straightened for home, allowed the winner the inside with a furlong to run and proved no match for that one late, lasted for
the place. SWEET BAY lacked early foot, five wide exiting the turn, shifted out to be wider still with a furlong to run, finished up willingly while too late for the
place. BIND ON EARTH back in mid pack while outside, five wide through the run, some advancement upper stretch, went flat late to lose the show.
BETISON broke on top, raced within striking distance well out in the strip, four wide trip through the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing
kick. BITSY C C LIL GIRL lacked speed, fanned six wide out of the turn, improved a bit but lacked a serious closing response as well. ITSNOTMYJOB
prompted the issue early, vied through the turn outside the runner up, faltered in the drive to the wire. STORM BREACH fell well back after the start to trail,
continued to lag turn, picked off a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. SUMMERTIME BANDIT was never a threat. LAURIEANN bumped at
the start, moved up to mid pack along with the winner, began to fade before a half. MADAME JANE flashed brief speed and stopped.

Footnotes
DASHYNS DREAM chased the dueling leaders past the wire the first time, remained closest to that pair the middle half, bid between rivals inside the furlong
marker, held clear then held sway late under steady handling. ALLIACEOUS settled off the pace toward the inside, covered up in some traffic into the far
turn, shifted out a bit for room when set down nearing midstretch, closed with some energy to be steadily getting to the winner late. I BEAR ARMS last
away, four wide through the first turn, closer three wide into the stretch, mild bid, outkicked for the second spot while up for the show in the final strides.
WORLD WAR dueled up front closest to the inside, garnered a larger advantage past the furlong marker, could not last. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER in the second
flight, came up empty for the drive. EMPTY NET broke inward but on top, dueled up front in the two path, first to blink into the stretch. QUINN ELLA three
wide trip, remained back in failing to muster a rally. SHEZ OUR ARCH trailed throughout in failing to menace.

Footnotes
AWESOME CAJUN broke on top and got to the inside, vied up the backstretch and into the turn, fell back off the leader into and through upper stretch, rebid
past the furlong marker, dug in late to prevail in game fashion. ASTERN BANKER back off the early pace outside, moved to a prominent position four wide
through the turn, challenged outside the winner nearing the furlong grounds, outkicked in the late going. CHIPEEE in mid pack up the backstretch, in some
traffic into the turn, steered to the outside midway the bend, rallied to be up for the show. RED ON THE HEAD moved up vie up front while off the inside up
the backstretch, gained a larger advantage late in the turn, responded when challenged with a furlong to run, weakened from between horses late, lost the
show at the wire. HOLIDAY RUN back off the pace, in some traffic late in the turn, came up empty when clear the final furlong. WILDCATS'S MEOW
remained back and was never dangerous. GOLDEN CONFUSION shuffled back along the rail a furlong in and did not threaten thereafter. MIDGE'S TIME
tired while racing outside. WILD FIST last to leave, four wide out of the turn, remained back in failing to rally.
