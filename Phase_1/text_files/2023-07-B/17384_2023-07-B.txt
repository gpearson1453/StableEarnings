Footnotes
WESTERN DREAM saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out four-wide nearing the quarter pole to launch her bid, took the lead nearing the
eighth pole and quickly drew clear. CAMDEN HIGH was allowed to settle in stride, moved up three-wise nearing the quarter pole, took a slight lead nearing
the eighth pole, but was unable to resist the winner while continuing on well for the place. GET MY POINT stalked the pace racing in hand, moved up to
take the lead nearing the quarter pole, led to near the eighth pole but lacked the needed late response. LUVAHAPPYENDING was unhurried early, moved
up five-wide nearing the quarter pole to reach contention but lacked a rally when asked. A LITTLE GRACE opened a clear lead shortly after the start, saved
ground setting the pace to nearing the quarter pole and gave way readily when headed.

on fairly well for third. TERNI VALENTINO was allowed to settle while racing four-wide on the turn and finished in a mild rally. MIRRORED broke in to bump
with DERBY BOY, then raced two-wide but lacked a rally. DERBY BOY was bumped at the start, then saved ground and was not a factor. FLY PARKER

OUR LYLA GRACE was reserved off the early pace while racing two-wide, lacked room nearing the quarter pole running up on horses, was able to angle to
the inside nearing the three-sixteenths pole, caught the leaders at the eighth pole and prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. BLAZINGBELLABLU hopped in the
air at the start, then was allowed to settle, moved up five-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished fast to just miss. TIZ A MACHO GIRL stumbled at the
start, then dropped back, swung out to come six-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY vied for the lead from the outset while
three-wide, responded to pressure and held on determinedly during the drive in a steady effort. SLACK TIDE was reserved off the early pace, moved up
four-wide nearing the quarter pole to offer her bid but faltered during the drive. YOUNG LIFE LAURA bobbled slightly at the start, then vied for the lead into
the stretch while two-wide and weakened late. ZIPPIN SEVENZ disputed the pace from along the inside for a half mile and tired.

from along the inside, drifted out slightly nearing the three-sixteenths pole and held on well in a steady effort. NORTHERN BLEND disputed the issue while
racing three-wide, was four-wide entering the stretch and weaknened. PERFECT ONE was reserved off the early pace, came five-wide into the stretch but
lacked a rally. TAP THE BANK hopped in the air at the start, then dropped back, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously threaten.

Footnotes
SLEW'S TIZ WHIZ was reserved off the early pace, angled out to come six-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth to win going
away. BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR vied for the early lead with POLACCO, disposed of that one entering the stretch to open a clear lead, but was unable to resist
the winner late. ZESTFUL was allowed to settle, rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished strongly. SMILING GOODBYE saved ground while being
forwardly placed, lacked room nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out two-wide nearing the stretch to split rivals, offered a bid nearing the eighth pole
and hung. COASTAL KID settled in stride early, came five-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. A MAN'S MAN was close up early while racing
three-wide but lacked a rally. YOU'RE THE CAUSE dropped back early while saving ground and improved his position late. ITSALLABOUTTHERIDE was
fractious in the gate, then raced three-wide and failed to threaten. MUNCEY saved ground while being unhurried, angled out four-wide nearing the
three-sixteenths pole but was not a factor. POLACCO vied for the lead from along the inside to the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WHATWASITHINKING was off a step slow, then rushed up between horses to open a clear lead, saved ground setting the pace and increased his
advantage. DEMOCRAT was close up from the outset while racing between horses, angled to the inside nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished well
for second in a steady effort. GOLD RUSH CANDY was prominent early racing along the inside, dropped back when in tight nearing the seven-sixteenths
pole, angled out to come three-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. IDIDNTSEETHATCOMIN was forwardly placed for a half mile while three-wide but
lacked a rally. STREET DEMAND was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PRINCE OF LUCK prompted the issue from
along the inside, was shuffled back when in tight nearing the quarter pole and gave way. KINGSTEN'S GOLD dropped back while saving ground and failed
to menace.
