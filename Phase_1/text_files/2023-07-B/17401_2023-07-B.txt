Footnotes
LIPLOCK was nestled on the rail behind the pacesetter, rated kindly inside down the backside, waited to pounce on the fence midpoint on the far turn, found
clear running room three wide in mid stretch and stubbornly fought in the late stages to win the battle for first. MASON'S MUSIC settled in midfield four deep
down the backstretch, rallied four wide with five sixteenths to make it a four way battle for the front at the top of the lane and fought to the wire with the
winner just getting outfinished by the winner late. DANISH DYNAMITE broke in at the beginning, tracked two wide outside on the first turn, bid just off the
fence for the front two furlongs from the finish, was clinging to the lead at the furlong marker but could not hold off the closers and settled for a clear third at
the finish line. RAVELLO BEAUTY hopped at the start, stalked five wide into the first turn, advanced steadily outside five deep down the back straight,
continued keeping up with the leaders in the five path through the far turn and determinedly ran on to the wire in the six path for a minor share in the end.
DADDY'S LEGACY broke out on the start, co-trailed outside of horses down the backstretch, was urged five wide with three eighths to go around rivals
making little headway, angled widest seven wide at the top of the lane and showed some late energy passing challengers in deep stretch. HOLIDAY WITH
AMY stalked three wide into the first turn, continued near the rear three deep at the half, was roused to keep up on the last turn and passed tired runners to
the finish. SAY GRACE travelled in midpack on the rail in the first turn and through the backstretch, was scrubbed on for more on the rail three furlongs from
home, made little impact and could not get involved down the lane. KEY STROKE settled near the rear at the back early on, co-trailed inside down the
backside, was urged on the fence in the final turn and was one paced to the wire. FOREST VIXEN had a good spot down the backstretch tracking in the
second flight three deep outside horses, took closer order through the far turn to bid three wide at the quarter pole, was in the mix for a share straightening
out for the drive but weakened in mid stretch. TELLTALE stalked in the middle of the pack just off the fence into the first turn, was ridden between foes trying
to quicken with others, offered a mild response and had little to show driving to the finish line. QUICKER TREAT was squeezed at the start, recovered to
lead into the first turn, set the fractions up front down the backside, was pushed for more keeping her head in front at the quarter pole, was swallowed up by
runners outside turning for home and backed away on the fence through the stretch.

Footnotes
READY TO JAM was forwardly-placed inside the leaders early but soon eased back off those and switched out stalking in behind three deep, waited
through the latter part of the turn, angled six wide in upper stretch, took aim and accelerated nicely to take command by mid-stretch and draw clear while
being kept busy. FOUR STRONG WINDS broke outwardly, stalked the leading group from outside the second flight, advanced four to five wide on the turn,
took the lead in upper stretch, was overtaken by mid-stretch and settled for second best. THEFRONTIERSMAN broke inwardly, was well-placed moving
forward inside, lost ground into the turn then advanced about the three-eighths to be within range of the leaders, came out to pass a rival in late stretch and
get up for show. WAGNER set a pressured pace racing inside on or just off the rail, weakened some in the stretch. ARASHI settled into stride well back
early, moved nearer the rail from two to three deep on the turn, came back out a bit for the stretch run and improved position. SILENT AND VIOLENT
contended between runners going two to three wide, weakened. BAR TALK was forced in and in a bit tight in the early going as a rival in front shifted in,
settled outside foes off the pace at that point, went three to four wide on the turn coming into upper stretch five deep, needed more but ran on. BE ON
NOTICE dropped back in the early going while lacking early speed, raced near the inside well back on the turn, swung out six wide into upper stretch, was
never near enough to threaten. INDY COWBOY was forced out then veered out badly at the start, raced well back and off the inside, was not a factor. MY
MUNNINGS MODEL broke a step slowly, raced well back, fanned seven wide, was unable to menace. SOUPER JUSTIFIED pressed from outside three to
four wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU was steadied mildly running under the wire for the first time, tracked outside three deep at the half in the second flight when the field
was bunching up, circled around horses four wide commencing at the three furlong pole, opened up on rivals at the top of the stretch and just had enough
left to hold on for the win in a well timed rally. STAYHONOR GOODSIDE was unhurried early on, could see the field running down the backstretch inside,
began to lengthen stride four wide at the quarter pole, swung out six wide for the drive to the wire and was closing in late just missing at the finish. MOON
LANDING broke inwards bumping rival to begin, settled in the second flight with runners on either side at the half, was coaxed for more midway on the final
turn, started to gain momentum three wide around foes at the quarter pole and grudgingly between horses was gaining steadily at the finish to be in the
place photo at the wire. STOWAWAY angled in trying to save ground from the outside post pressing the pace entering the first turn, kept a close eye on the
pacesetter three deep outside down the back straight, could not match strides with the rallying winner midway on the far turn and finished up evenly
between foes to the wire. WINSTON BLUE took this field on the rail into the first turn, continued dictating the pace mildly pressured down the backside, was
collared outside by the winner at the five sixteenths pole, offered no resistance, battled for the minor shares in upper stretch and yielded in the last sixteenth.
MO TOURIST was nudged on the rail trying to keep his inside position on the first turn, tracked on the fence at the half mile marker in the second flight,
offered a mild run inside at the three eighths pole making little advance and could not be a presence in the stretch run. SHAMATEUR broke out at the start
bumping rival, prompted between horses into the first turn and throughout the backstretch, was urged to maintain position in the two path between foes but
to no avail midpoint on the far turn and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
NIAGARA SKYLINE got away alertly and quickly went clear to dictate terms racing off the hedge, was shadowed but never really threatened by pursuing
foes, asked for more at the quarter pole and responded to extend the advantage and held safe under steady handling. DOWNY BOY settled off the pace
inside, came off the rail about the three-eighths, moved four wide into upper stretch, pursued the winner in vain but was clearly second best. HAVE A
SOUPER DAY stalked mid-pack three then four wide on the turn, came out five to six wide turning into upper stretch, kept on well and got the nod for show.
BEAU GUEST tracked from in behind and inside, kept on one-paced, lost the nod for third. BASKETBALL JONES shadowed the winner from outside, was
still witin range on the turn going three wide, weakened in the stretch. BIG EXECUTIVE advanced outside on the turn moving out from four to six wide on
that bend, was floated out wider leaving the turn, bumped in mid-stretch and ran on evenly. DUNEDIN exchanged a light bump at the start, advanced
between runners four then five wide on the turn, drifted out wider into upper stretch and again in mid-stretch bumping a rival in the process, needed more.
MIDNIGHT ARKLE was forced in at the start when making light contact with an outside foe, raced off the inside toward the rear, swung five to six wide for
the drive, was not a threat. CRUMLIN LAD exchanged some light contact at the start, was a bit rank fighting the rider in the early going moving from inside
to outside, continued from off the rail and was not a threat. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND failed to threaten while racing off the inside.

Footnotes
KINETIC STONE broke out at the start, took control soon after the start, opened up comfortably on rivals on the turn, extended his lead in upper stretch and
held safe at the finish. POSTURING settled in midpack on the rail, was shuffled on the fence a couple of positions early part of the turn, rallied on the fence
at the quarter pole, shifted outside in the three path turning for home and finished up strongly surging late for the runners up share. UNCAPTURED
MOMENT was hustled early trying to get the lead inside, chased the unchallenged winner down the backside, continued to pursue throughout the turn but to
no avail and faded in deep stretch losing second money at the wire. MT LOGAN was situated between foes in the third flight with four furlongs remaining,
kept pace with runners on the turn, found a seam four wide at the top of the lane and finished up evenly for a minor role at the wire. MORSTACHY'S was
void of speed travelling near the rear inside, advanced mildly on the fence throughout the turn, shifted out turning for home six wide, had nowhere to go
behind a wall of horses, angled back inside to the rail at the furlong marker and put in a late rally finishing to the wire. RED LINE OVERDRIVE stalked in the
third flight outside three deep, offered a brief run four wide around rivals at the three furlong marker, was floated out to the seven path for the drive to the
finish and levelled out in mid stretch. DISSECTOLOGIST was allowed to settle close to the back with four furlongs to go, offered a mild run when nudged for
more at the quarter pole, was pushed out eight wide at the top of the stretch and had no finish to give with runners on either side to the line. WALTER ME
LAD was unhurried near the rear three wide down the backstretch, could not get into contention when urged for more throughout the turn outside and had
little to offer down the lane through to the wire. RENEGADE SERENADE was off slow to begin trailing down the backside, could not get interested on the
turn, could see the field seven wide for the drive but was never involved to the finish. SILENT FORTUNE tracked the frontrunner winner outside down the
back straight, was hard ridden two furlongs out making little gain while drifting out and gave way between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
TUNECHI settled off the pace racing inside into the turn, saved some ground, gradually began to be guided out leaving that turn and beginning to pick it up,
swung out six to seven wide heading into upper stretch, gained steadily outside taking the lead past the furlong marker and drove clear. MAGIC SLIPS
shifted in early, saved ground in behind along the inside through the turn in the second flight, came out three to four wide for the drive, was in a bit tight near
the furlong grounds, fought on gamely between runners to secure the place. WESTERN WHIRL broke alertly and had the early lead but was soon
outsprinted by an inside foe, stalked that one two to three wide, asked to keep pace about the five-sixteenths, moved out four to five wide for the drive, kept
on well late but needed more. BEDARD was within range stalking outside, went four wide on the turn, bid at the quarter taking a narrow lead, drifted about
through the stretch bumping a rival in the process and was outkicked. SOUTHERN STYLE settled outside racing three wide in behind the leading group on
the turn, came out five to six wide turning for home, kept on late. AWESOME ENTRY settled outside a rival off the pace racing two to four wide on the turn,
came out further in upper- to mid-stretch, showed late interest. CULPRIT broke a step slowly, was urged strongly and moved forward inside rapidly to soon
take the lead, set the pace near the rail, was just overtaken past the quarter pole, fought on, began to weaken a furlong out, was bumped at that juncture
and in tight near the sixteenth as a rival continued to drift about. MOTION GRANTED veered out at the break, raced well back outside, swung seven wide
into upper stretch, ran on mildly. HALCON NEGRO was never a threat. TRUE SHOT broke a step slowly then veered out quite sharply and abruptly a few
strides later, was outpaced.

IL MALOCCHIO was reined back between foes entering the backstretch, rated kindly outside in the third flight stalked the top three, started to gain
momentum three wide midway on the far turn, swung out five deep for the stretch drive, wore down the leaders through the lane and got up late nearing the
wire in a close finish. ANGELOU took this field on the rail into the first turn, dictated the pace down the backside, was headed outside at the quarter pole,
fended off the early challenge in upper stretch, braced for the closers on either side at the furlong marker, dug in stubbornly late drifting in driving to the
finish and held between horses for the place share in a three horse photo for the top three placings. SOUPER HOITY TOITY prompted three wide in the first
turn, tracked two deep at the half between foes, was roused with runners on either side with five sixteenths remaining, battled inside to be in the mix of
things turning for home, was bumped by outside rival at the seventy yard pole, recovered quickly finishing up gamely in the end and just missed by narrow
margins for the win at the wire in a gritty stretch effort. KATE'S KINGDOM pressed the pace four wide on the first turn, pulled the rider to take closer order
outside pressing the issue at the three furlong marker, bid for the lead outside at the quarter pole but stalled four deep at the furlong marker and settled for a
small share of the prize in the end. VALENTINA DAY was nestled on the rail behind the pacesetter in the first turn, continued on the fence tracking on the
rail in the third flight at the half, was ridden for more inside on the far turn, could not keep pace with the leaders and finished evenly besting the others to the
finish line. SARATOGA VISION settled near the back on the rail early on, co-trailed on the inside down the back straight, was steadied going for the same
hole as a fellow rival at the quarter pole, regrouped in upper stretch and passed some finishing between horses to the wire. BATYAH trailed the field four
wide on the first turn, co-trailed outside down the backstretch, offered a mild turn of foot midway on the far turn going for a seam in the three path at the
quarter pole and could not find more down the lane showing little energy to the finish line. SISTER SEAGULL stalked three wide near the rear, put in a mild
move four wide outside foes to be in range of the leaders at the half mile marker, could not make any gain on the front group five wide around horses on the
far turn and weakened outside in midstretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #2 ANGELOU AND #6 SOUPER HOITY TOITY DOWN THE STRETCH

Footnotes
DREAM SHAKE watched the frontrunner down the backstretch, continued to keep a close eye on the pacesetter through the the turn, pounced to the lead
between rivals straightening out for the drive, drifted outwards under left handed urging at the sixteenth pole and again nearing the wire but held safe for the
win at the finish. WAR BOMBER (IRE) settled in mid pack between horses three furlongs from the finish, was fighting to keep position in the three path in
upper stretch, continued to stubbornly battle with outside foes at the furlong pole finally getting clear running room and finished up to capture second money
in a photo at the line. LUCKY SCORE trailed the field down the back straight, began to lengthen stride outside at the five sixteenths pole, swung out seven
wide gaining momentum in upper stretch, was full of run in the last furlong closing strongly and was involved with two others for place share at the wire but
settled for third money in a tight photo at the finish. CHURCHTOWN was unhurried early settling near the rear, started to rally in the four path with five
sixteenths to go, quickly lost momentum losing its path inside the quarter pole, regrouped to fight on in tight surroundings with runners on either side at the
furlong marker, kept on closing in on the leader in deep stretch but was steadied just a few jumps before the finish losing the three horse photo at the wire
for place. OLD CHESTNUT travelled in midfield three deep with three eighths to go, took the overland route in the six path at the top of the lane, was in the
hunt for the prize challenging between horses with a furlong left, steadied in deep stretch and could not recover in time to play a role at the wire. DREAMS
OF TOMORROW stalked near the rear two deep down the backside, saved ground running at the back on the turn, shifted out five wide in upper stretch
seeing the field, angled out for clear run in lane eight at the furlong pole and ran on willingly to the wire. ROARING FORTIES emerged with the lead taking
this field down the backstretch at the five furlong pole, continued to set a reasonable pace through the turn, was collared outside two furlongs from home,
dug in gamely until the eighth pole and faded inside the final sixteenth. BANFF had a good spot on the rail tracking the top two down the backside, was
roused while losing positioning throughout the far turn and could not get involved driving to the finish line. BOUND FOR NOWHERE pulled the rider to the
lead after the start, was then reined back under a snug hold to track the leaders at the five eighths pole, offered a run to bid five wide at the top of the stretch
with a quarter to go and retreated between rivals in the final eighth. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING THE STRETCH RUN AND RIDERS CLAIM OF
FOUL #9 OLD CHESTNUT AGAINST #2 CHURCHTOWN NEARING THE FINISH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE. ALSO, RIDER'S CLAIM OF FOUL #2
CHURCHTOWN ON #3 DREAM SHAKE IN THE FINAL SIXTEENTH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE AS WELL.

Footnotes
PARAMOUNT PRINCE was quick to the lead setting the tempo from inside and in the clear, spurted away in upper to mid-stretch when roused and was
kept to the task. COOL KISS settled outside foes at the rear racing three wide on the first turn, began to advance leaving the backstretch moving four wide
into the far turn, gradually edged nearer the leaders while moving out seven wide by the top of the stretch, drifted in through the lane, won the battle for
place. TWIN CITY rated mid-pack off the fence about two to three wide, raced in behind foes coming to the quarter pole lacking room, found it between
rivals in upper stretch after coming out a bit, rallied and fought late between foes but missed the place. VELOCITOR shifted in heading to the first turn
tracking the eventual winner from inside, saved ground both turns, kept on in the stretch but outfinished for the minor awards. PHILIP MY DEAR tucked in
two to three wide racing about mid-division early, was ridden along three furlongs out, shifted out six wide leaving the far turn making some progress,
evened out through the lane. STANLEY HOUSE raced at the rear switching outside foes about to the three path into the first turn, continued to trail early up
the backstretch before being guided out further and advancing outside foes into the far turn, moved five then six wide on that bend and was again in behind
runners coming past the quarter pole, went evenly thereafter. TIBURON saved ground inside racing off the pace, was off the rail on the far turn still well
back of the leaders, ran on belatedly to improve. GUNS N' ROJAS lacked early gate speed racing toward the back inside, was still left with much to do on
the far turn when put to urging and shifting out at the five-sixteenths, came into upper stretch about four to five wide, was guided out further past the furlong
marker nearing the sixteenth and ran on. FOREST BUZZ exchanged light contact after the start, moved forward willingly to get position, stalked the eventual
winner from outside two to three deep, could not kick on and was not persevered with late. GRAN SPIRITED was forwardly-positioned two to three wide,
weakened in the stretch. SIMCOE raced mid-pack three wide early, began to advance four deep at the three-eighths, flattened out in the lane. PAT'S
GAMBLE exchanged a light bump after the start, was in tight and steadied just slightly heading into the first turn between and behind runners, raced off the
pace, went three then four wide on the far turn, failed to menace.

Footnotes
ELYSIAN FIELD was well-positioned off the pace racing inside early saving ground through the first turn, was guided out advancing on the far turn three
deep, angled six wide turning into upper stretch and full of run, struck the lead near the eighth pole, drifted out late under left-handed urging but held well.
WICKENHEISER was taken back and angled in shortly after the start, saved ground on the first turn, moved out and advanced three wide up the
backstretch, continued to weave through runners near but off the rail on the far turn with momentum, shifted six wide into the stretch, kept on well for the
place but could not threaten the winner late. FORTYFIVESEVENTY tucked in to the two path entering the first turn tracking in behind the leaders, was well
positioned into the far turn two to three wide on that bend, faced some traffic and altered out at the furlong marker, kicked on well but could only secure
show honors. ME AND MY SHADOW settled just off the pace outside four wide, was within range of the leader coming to the quarter pole but ran on evenly
late for the minor award. TICKER TAPE HOME settled off the dueling leaders but with good forward position, stalked those three to four wide, advanced on
the far turn taking the lead outside the five-sixteenths, led till nearing the furlong grounds then faltered. BIG BRASS BED settled mid-pack inside saving
ground on the first turn, switched out up the backstretch, went four wide on the far turn, floated seven wide into the stretch, ran on evenly.
FLYSOFREEASHLEEB was unhurried at the back, began to advance on the far turn fanning five wide into upper stretch, was guided out further for room at
that juncture and fan on but needed more. COURTLY RO shifted in two to three wide racing well back, passed tired foes. FASHIONABLY FAB moved to the
lead while shifting in a bit, engaged by an inside rival soon after, dueled with that one up the backstretch, put that rival away but was soon challenged by
numerous others, weakened in the stretch. TITO'S CALLING settled up close but off the leaders racing about three to four wide, was encouraged along
moving out a bit at the three-eighths, moved much nearer the leaders under all out drive by the quarter pole but flattened out in the lane. COLLECT DATTT
tossed her head a bit at the start, settled outside a foe two to three wide near mid-division into the first turn, lost ground up the backstretch into the far turn
still going about two to three deep, came out a bit for the drive and failed to menace. DELPHIA settled between runners into the first turn racing off the
leaders but not too far back, advanced into the far turn three then four wide, was in tight and steadied slightly nearing the three-eighths, ran on. GREAT
KATE settled inside, failed to threaten. FRIENDS FOR LIFE was forced in a bit early heading past the wire the first time, was pulling and keen to go on,
moved forward to contest the pace inside, dueled up the backstretch, was done at the three-eighths and retreated.

Footnotes
SECRETARYOFTHENILE pressed outside in the beginning, began to edge away from the early frontrunner at the half, opened up on the field in hand in
upper stretch, was kept to the task at the eighth pole and held safe crossing the finish. CRY FREEDOM stalked near the back outside horses, co-trailed
through the turn, shifted out widest in the nine path for the stretch drive and closed with a rush in the final furlong to best the rest easily at the wire. BE LIKE
LEIGH stalked close to the back two deep down the backstretch, began to pick up runners weaving through traffic in upper stretch, found running room in
the six path in mid stretch and rallied to get up to capture the show photo in the end. MORNING RUN travelled on the fence in mid pack running on the turn,
rallied to be in the mix four wide at the quarter pole but was one paced down the stretch and held for a minor role inside horses at the finish.
HELIOCENTRIC travelled at the rear in the early going three deep, stalked behind runners at the top of the lane, found her best stride late at the eighth pole
and offered a good late kick closing strongly in deep stretch. PRINCESSONAMISSION tracked in the second flight between horses watching the top two,
was ridden for more in the three path to be in the hunt turning for home, battled briefly in mid stretch and stalled on the fence in the final eighth. ONDINE
LADY tracked in the second flight between at the half, followed the winner outside on the turn, loomed four wide in upper stretch and tired in the final
sixteenth of a mile. COCO'S DREAM settled near the rear down the backside, made little progression inside on the turn and found some late energy
passing tired runners down the stretch. JOKES UP was situated in the middle of the pack between rivals at the half, made a little run outside at the three
eighths pole, was floated out to the seven path straightening out for the drive and could not get involved running to the wire. NEOLITHIC NATION prompted
the pace inside early on, waited behind foes under a snug hold on the fence with four furlongs remaining, travelled in midfield when shuffled back at the
three furlong marker and backed away at the sixteenth pole. JULIE'S MIST trailed throughout and passed a weary runner down the lane. JUST ON TIME
had a slim lead between horses down the backside, was relegated to the chaser inside with half mile to run, could not keep up when roused at the quarter
pole and retreated in the last furlong.
