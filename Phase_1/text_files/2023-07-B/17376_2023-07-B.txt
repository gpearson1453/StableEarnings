Footnotes
IMAGE OF QUALITY stalked near the back of the field three deep in the early going, started to figure things out lengthening stride going around rivals four
wide at the three eighths marker, was behind horses looking for a clear path at the top of the lane, experienced some traffic issues to the wire but fought on
gamely to surge late for the hard fought victory down the stretch. LAST MONARCH had a good spot tracking the contesting duo outside, took closer order
when asked midway on the turn, bid four wide outside rivals straightening out for the drive, took control while drifting in at the sixteenth pole but could not
hold off the late surge by the winner nearing the wire. CHAIRMAN RAINBOW broke in at the start, travelled in midpack on the rail, tracked behind the top
two with three furlongs to go, was on hold in hand on the fence two furlongs from the wire, had clear running room inside at the top of the lane and
determinedly finished up the fence to capture third money. JMR SPEEDY ESCAPE was pushed to the rail at the break, assumed command narrowly down
the back straight, continued to have a slim lead being hounded outside on the turn, was collared by runners turning for home outside and offered little
resistance between foes in upper stretch and faded in the two path at the furlong marker holding on for a minor role. GOLDEN WIND hopped at the break
trailing down the backstretch, rallied on the fence midturn, was gaining steadily on the fence in upper stretch, had no room to go at the furlong marker
behind runners, shifted out at the sixteenth pole and offered a mild finish late. TODAY settled near the rear four deep down the backstretch, angled to the
rail entering the turn advancing inside, was steadied on the fence at the five sixteenths marker, regrouped but was getting out on the turn at the quarter pole,
swung five for the drive to the finish and was one paced while drifting out to the wire. BEE BEE THE KING prompted the pace outside down the backside,
chased the frontrunner outside throughout the turn, was hard ridden with rivals on either side at the quarter marker vying for the lead and retreated in mid
stretch. CORONATION BOY had a slow start to begin, was asked between to get a better position at the half, roused for more midpoint on the turn but to no
avail and was empty in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
AGILE DANCER settled off the leaders stalking three to four wide early, continued patiently outside a foe in behind the top pair racing two to three deep on
the far turn, came out five to six wide in upper stretch with aim, rallied outside to the front past the furlong marker and forged clear under steady handling.
HANK OLLIE got away well and moved forward, dropped to the rail about the three-quarter content to track inside, was well-positioned in behind the leaders
till upper stretch, came out four to five wide for the drive, bid between runners in mid-stretch but was outfinished. MIAH SAID moved forward inside heading
into the first turn switching off the rail just past the three-quarters, moved up outside the leader leaving the first turn to press from outside two to three deep,
edged closer making a bid at the top of the stretch and with a narrow lead till past the furlong marker, was outkicked. BIG SHOOTER lacked early speed
despite moderate encouragement, saved ground along the inside at the rear racing on or just off the rail, began to inch closer on the far turn still saving
ground, came out turning into upper stretch, gained steadily moving between rivals at the sixteenth to secure the minor award and continued to make up
minor ground on the top trio but too late. STEPHEN B GOOD raced two wide into the first turn mid-division, lost ground on the leading group up the
backstretch, began to gain some into upper stretch coming out three to four deep, ran on mildly and needed more. BAIT N SWITCH broke a step slowly and
lost the path at the break, settled at the back outside three to four deep, advanced five wide up the backstretch, moved in a bit on the far turn then back out
turning for home, could not sustain the effort and evened out in the lane. GLOBAL CHAIRMAN broke a step slowly, was coaxed forward getting caught wide
and outside runners into the first turn, was able to shift in on that bend, set the pace shadowed by a rival up the backstretch, was challenged at the top of
the stretch, weakened late. SECRET CAMELOT raced outside a foe two to three wide in the back half of the field, moved out leaving the far turn, was
unable to menace. DIXIE'S FLATTER briefly chased two to three wide, steadily retreated. TALL BOY JOEL was caught four to five wide around the first
turn, dropped back heading into the far turn, faded.

Footnotes
FOREVER DIXIE brushed gate and was bumped inside to begin, travelled comfortably in hand outside horses in midfield down the backside, was nudged to
go with five sixteenths to the finish, quickly pounced to lead going around foes at the top of the lane four deep and coasted home in the late stages.
PEMBERLEY was allowed to settle seeing the field into the first turn, advanced smartly on the fence throughout the back straight, was blocked when behind
the tiring early leaders inside two furlongs from the finish, swung outside four wide for running room and closed belatedly for second, besting the rest in the
end. LADY BREW was under a good hold tracking alone in third watching the top two engage at the half, took up the chase fighting three wide at the quarter
marker, could not match strides with the top two turning for home and settled for a clear third crossing the line. NOW IS A BREEZE kept a close eye on the
loose frontrunner in the first turn, was content loping along outside at the flank of the leader down the backstretch, was ridden in the two path battling for the
lead two furlongs to the finish, could not quicken with others and faded in upper stretch while still holding for a small piece of the prize. MORAL TURPITUDE
broke out at the start to travel near the rear into the first turn, could see the field entering the backstretch, offered a mild turn of foot swinging four wide at the
quarter pole and had little to show through the stretch drive. WINGS FROM ABOVE took this field inside into the first turn, dictated the pace while prompted
outside down the backside, was scrubbed on clinging to the lead at the quarter pole, could not find another gear and backed away on the fence in upper
stretch. VIVID VIXEN stalked three wide on the first turn, settled in last outside horses three deep at the half mile marker, could not keep pace on the far
turn with rivals, lost touch with the field turning for home and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
VERI GIZMO tracked from inside just off the leaders, came out for room, bid three wide between runners in mid-stretch taking command at the eighth pole,
kicked clear. WEEHAWKEN shifted in then back out late up the backstretch making up ground, went in the two to three path on the turn ridden along from
the three-eighths and put to more stout urging at the quarter pole while coming out further still, was five wide in upper stretch, ran on to get up for second.
CARA CARA was within range shadowing the pacesetter under a hold early, went three wide on the turn, loomed a threat nearing the eighth pole, lacked
the needed late kick and lost place late. SOCIETY'S KAT was forced out a bit in tight quarters past the half as an inside rival sought room, shifted in and
began to advance inside foes just off the rail on the turn from the back half of the field, angled seven wide at the top of the stretch, kicked on well but too
late. GIVE ME THE BOOTS moved forward inside to dictate terms racing just off the rail, was clear into the turn, gave way near the furlong grounds. NO
MORE DIAMONDS was off the pace racing near the inside on or just off the rail, shifted out four wide coming to the quarter pole and outside a runner five
deep at the top of the stretch, ran on but needed more. SILVER BULLET LADY raced mid-pack outside stalking up the backstretch, was forced out a bit at
the half as rivals came out, moved back in to travel two to three wide on the turn, failed to rally. KATCHY NAME was up close stalking from outside four
wide, asked to keep pace three furlongs out but had no response. HELLUVA HOLIDAY lacked early speed racing inside, saved ground to no avail. SPEEDY
RIVER lacked early speed outside at the rear, was not a factor.

Footnotes
AIROSA broke sharply to take control from the onset, set the pace alone down the backside, was uncontested making the fractions through the turn, rider
looked back for competition at the eighth pole running in hand, was kept to the task just for attention purposes late and cruised in for the effortless victory.
GOLDEN CANARY broke out on the break, was in the second flight tracking three deep outside, loomed the only threat four wide in upper stretch and
chased the winner in vain to the wire still holding onto the place share in the end. CREVALLE D'ORO travelled inside on the rail in the third flight down the
backside, kept pace with the leaders throughout the turn, angled out six wide for the stretch run, was running greenly in the final furlong but finished well
being a solid third between runners at the wire. NANTUCKETS DAY stalked close to the back of the field in the beginning, rallied in the seven path widest at
the quarter pole, was bumped by inside rival in upper stretch and finished with intent the final furlong to play a minor role in the end. VILLI OLENTO tracked
between horses three deep down the backside, slipped back a touch in the two path with three eighths to go, continued to show interest finishing down the
stretch and ran on well to the wire in an honest effort. KELLER (IRE) was off slow to begin, stalked in midpack on the rail down the backstretch, made little
headway on the fence running through the turn, drifted out in upper stretch driving to the wire to be in the six path at the furlong marker and passed some
late to the finish. MAGIC TOKEN ran just off the fence in midfield at the half mile marker, offered a brief run with five sixteenths remaining, angled out for the
drive in the six path, bumped outside rival in upper stretch and levelled off in the final eighth. RED SAMURAI was bumped to begin to be close to the back of
the pack after the start, made little impression on the turn and could not reach contention driving to the finish. MIRAMICHI broke inwards throwing her head
to begin, settled in the third flight outside rival down the backstretch, offered an early move around foes three wide starting at the three eighths marker, was
in with a chance for a small share of the prize with three sixteenths to go but stalled in the last furlong. WORLD SHOWCASE tracked the winner on the rail
in the beginning, was in range on the fence straightening out for the drive, was asked for more in upper stretch ,no response and stopped on the rail at the
furlong marker. SECORD trailed down the backstretch, passed a straggler with three furlongs to go and was not a factor in the stretch run. KOZY KURLIN
KITTEN was bumped at the start to be near the back in the early stages, was ridden to keep up on the turn, could see the field turning for home and could
not get involved down the lane.

Footnotes
AUBRIETA exchanged a bump just after the start, settled off the pace racing outside, moved wide on the turn fanning eight deep into upper stretch, rallied
outside and just got up. TRADING BAY pressed the pace from outside under a very tight hold early, went three wide on the turn racing on even terms late
on that bend, took command at the three-sixteenths, was clear in mid-stretch, just caught in the shadow of the wire. GLORIANNIA exchanged a bump at the
start, raced outside off the leaders going four to five wide on the turn, moved inside and with the eventual winner into upper stretch, put forth a good late
effort but needed more. BEYOND MYBUDGET stalked from between runners three to four wide, kept on in the lane. GAMBLE'S SILVER tracked from
inside just off the leaders in behind, kept on along the rail in the stretch. MADEMOISELLE NOVA was quickly to the front, set the pace while shifting in to
about the two path, pressured into and on the turn, overtaken by the three-sixteenths and steadily weakened. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE steadied on heels
nearing the five-eighths racing inside, continued near but off the rail at the back through the turn, shifted out leaving that bend to be six wide at the top of the
stretch then tipped out further, ran on. HELL N WILD settled at the back, forced out from three to five wide on the turn, moved out more in the lane, went
evenly and made no bid. NOVEMBER FOG stalked from outside four wide into the turn, came up empty. PLEASURE'S GOLD raced at the rear between
foes two to three wide, had no rally.

Footnotes
MOHAWK TRAIL stalked close to the back three deep, waited in the four path in upper stretch behind runners looking for clear running room, found daylight
at the three sixteenths marker three wide, shot on through at the furlong pole and found another gear in deep stretch to win going away at the finish line.
QUEEN PICASSO (GB) pulled her rider to the lead under a snug hold down the backside, continued to set a soft pace on the turn up front, opened on the
the chasing challengers in mid stretch but could not find more late and was caught by the fast closing winner nearing the wire. LOVE TO SHOP settled in
the middle of the pack between foes, was ridden for more on the rail at the top of the stretch, was gaining steadily inside, shifted out off a tiring leader in the
three path late and got up for third but just missed closing in for the place share. RYDER RYDER RYDER was allowed to settle trailing the field in the early
parts of the race inside, saved ground through the turn, could see the pack on the rail at the top of the lane and was gaining with every stride in the final
furlong slipping through on the fence in deep stretch to get up for a minor role in the end. LAST CALL stalked near the back of the pack in the early going,
was roused behind runners looking for a seam running in the six path turning for home and was unable to extend herself in tight surroundings in the last
sixteenth and had to be steadied nearing the wire costing a position. BLIND SPOT sat behind the frontrunner down the backside and on the turn, took closer
order in upper stretch between horses in the four path but could not find more in the late stages of the race and faded in deep stretch. PRELIMINARY (GB)
stalked in midfield on the rail, waited behind foes in hand on the turn, swung out six wide for the stretch drive, loomed a threat in upper stretch but tired
outside in the last sixteenth of a mile. VIOLET GIBSON (IRE) tracked just outside off the frontrunner down the backside, basically continued in that position
through the running on the turn, was in the mix five wide at the quarter marker looking a threat but yielded at the furlong pole. BORN TO BOOGIE had a
good position tracking the top three outside down the backstretch, was asked to quicken with others straightening out for the drive widest in the six path in
upper stretch but came up empty in the final furlong.

LOYALTY rated off the leaders tracking in behind and inside, bided time through the turn, found an opening on the rail at the top of the stretch to launch a
bid, took the lead about a furlong out and spurted clear under urging after a brief duel. CLITHEROE (GB) was away well and in contention for lead,
prompted by an outside foe, retook command heading into the turn racing inside on then just off the rail, dueled briefly with the aforementioned as that rival
bid inside but was no match. TALK TO YA LATER settled into stride off the pace, saved ground on or just off the rail on the turn, came out six wide for the
drive, rallied late to get up for show. MISS SPEEDY stalked from outside three to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick and lost third late. HARD
EDGE prompted the pace from outside two to three wide, weakened in the stretch. HAZELBROOK was fractious in the gate, hopped and was about two to
three lengths slow, switched out and advanced to regain contact outside about four to five wide up the backstretch and into the turn, swung out seven deep
for the stretch run, lacked the needed late kick. BABY NO WORRIES trailed racing off the inside lane and was not a threat.

Footnotes
SOUPER WATSON was allowed to settle outside in the early going, started a long sustained run around rivals three furlongs to the finish, loomed the threat
four deep at the top of the stretch, wore down the leaders to seize control at the sixteenth pole and held safe at the finish. LAST AMERICAN EXIT stalked
near the rear on the rail, could not match strides with others quickening at the five sixteenths pole, angled five wide for the drive to the wire and found his
best stride late closing gamely to the finish to be second best. SECRET RESERVE had a good position tracking outside four deep, could not maintain
position when the winner circled foes midway on the turn, shifted into the rail in upper stretch, weaved his way through traffic at the sixteenth pole and
closed in to capture third between horses late. MASON'S GAMBLE waited on the fence trailing the field at the three furlong marker, rallied up the rail in
upper stretch, lost path at the furlong pole, shifted outwards and recovered with a strong late run to just miss getting up for third in the end. OUTADORE
pressed the issue on the rail down the backside, was shuffled on the fence some into the turn, was in range in the three path behind runners in upper stretch
and offered little finish to the wire. MACLEAN'S POSSE was hard held between foes at the half, took up the chase closing in on the frontrunner through the
turn, bid outside two wide in upper stretch, was asking for the wire clinging to the lead at the eighth pole and tired in deep stretch. THE MINKSTER took
command soon after the start, dictated the pace comfortably on the turn, was collared outside at the top of the lane, battled on the fence until the sixteenth
pole and stopped with seventy yards to go.

Footnotes
CAHIRA'S BLESSING got away alertly and quickly sped clear to set the pace near the inside, reined in the speed a bit on the turn allowing rivals to
approach, turned away those and was clear yet again into the stretch, held safe under steady handling. FIRING BULLETS lacked early speed, shifted in,
saved ground on the turn on or just off the rail but lacked room inside and in behind rivals under a tight hold from about the three-eighths to the top of the
stretch, came out three to four wide at the top of the stretch, moved out further for clearance five to six deep by mid-stretch and kicked on to be clearly
second best. CURLIN CANDY got away a step slowly and a bit awkwardly, advanced under some coaxing to move between rivals about the nine-sixteenth
and not too far back of the leader, moved out four to five wide turning into upper stretch, evened out late. ROSEBUD'S HOPE settled just off the pace
stalking mid-division three to four wide into and on the turn, came out six to seven wide for the drive, ran on and needed more. PROUD SPEAKER chased
briefly from outside soon dropping back to settle in outside the trailing group, went four to six wide through the turn, came out nine wide in the stretch and
improved position. LADY URUS bobbled just slightly at the start but recovered quickly to get forward position tracking inside rivals and in behind the leader
and eventual winner racing off the fence in the two to three path, lacked the needed late kick. SHE MAKES A POINT raced at the back between runners into
the turn going three to four deep, needed more. SOUPER PECAN got away well, dropped back off the leaders racing mid-pack outside foes four to five wide
into the turn, floated out seven to eight deep turning into the stretch and ran on but needed more. RETAIL THERAPIST saved ground inside but raced
one-paced. HAI BOBBI stalked early, was up close and within range three to four wide early on the turn, drifted out leaving that bend and again in upper
stretch, faded.
