Footnotes
ONEMORETIMEAROUND broke back, a bit keen past the wire the first time, settled off the pace and the inside, advanced into contention three wide in the
second turn, challenged on the outside entering the stretch, put a head in front when straightened for home, cleared while drifting in slightly then held the
runner up safe late. MERCI in the second flight, saved ground second turn, behind traffic late in that bend, steered out for room approaching midstretch,
finished up willingly to be getting to the winner late. MONARCH MAN forwardly placed off the rail, moved to challenge between foes entering the stretch, not
enough in the late going for the top two while holding the show spot. ZULTAN broke on top, set the pace inside, briefly responded when confronted entering
the straight then began to falter when headed soon after. TIZ THE BIG ONE pressured the leader for five furlongs and had little left for when the real running
began turning for home. BONUS APPRECIATION went one paced in lacking a closing kick. VALIANT DEFENDER void of early foot, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals while never a threat. TENOR raced in mid pack for six furlongs, weakened through the stretch. YOUR TIME'S COMING had nothing for the
drive.

Footnotes
SHADY STAR broke in mid pack, moved up to press the issue into the turn, dueled into the stretch, took over, well clear inside the furlong marker, enough
left to hold sway. LOST GOLD moved up to race in the second flight along the inside up the backstretch, moved out then idled through the turn, set down for
the drive, late rally in the three path to finish up willingly. ONE MORE SLEEP pressed the issue along the inside for a half, fell back off the winner by late in
the turn, finished up best of the rest. ALWAYS LOGAN broke alertly from the outside, showed the way out of the chute, continued to hold the advantage
between foes far turn, dueled into the lane then faltered nearing midstretch. SHOETRICK turned in an even effort throughout. MY UNCLE BILLY remained
back in failing to rally. BASTI BLUE last away, trailed throughout and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SWEET SASSICAIA tracked the two leaders just off the inside, continued to pursue that pair through the turn and into the stretch, late surge to power by.
KISS UPON A STAR back off the pace and the inside, rallied on the outside and was also going well at the end. RUN AWAY SAMARI broke alertly,. dueled
up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate into the lane, shook clear with a furlong to run, proved no match for the top two late. ELLA'S BABY void
of speed, continued to race back through the turn while saving ground, displayed some mild late interest the final furlong to improve position. BOSTON
PAULETTE broke back, trailed in the two path, also improved position a bit while not a serious late threat. NATURALBORNSENDER dueled up front in the
two path, gave way stretch. VEGAS ON MY MIND came in at the start, mid pack early, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
NOSY BANKER in the second flight while racing outside, ranged up to challenge three wide and between horses turning for home, dueled the final furlong,
dug in late to prevail in game fashion. OAK HILL LG broke out, raced back early in lacking speed, moved up four wide to challenge entering the stretch, put
a head in front past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire outside the winner, outgamed in the late going. GUITAR TRIBUTE hesitated at the break to spot
the field a couple of lengths, continued to trail, came widest for the drive, staged a rally toward the center of the strip to be in time for the show. JEB'S
LUCKY EIGHT in the main body early, closer after a half, challenged inside the pacesetter midway on the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through
the stretch. CALIBRACHOA KID moved up to take command after the start, set the early pace well out in the strip, continued to show the way in the three
path far turn, weakened when headed in upper stretch. KAJUN KARMA within striking distance early, moved closer while being asked along the rail midway
on the final turn, steadied while unable to keep up with a quarter to run and fell back. FLASHING ANGELBABY settled in mid pack, had nothing for the
drive.

Footnotes
HARDLY ABLE prompted the issue up front in the run up the backstretch well out in the strip, challenged four wide and between horses turning for home,
gained a slight advantage approaching midstretch and powered clear. ANGELIC KNIGHT broke in to bother POPPA MAGIC causing that one to steady,
was straightened to race off the pace well wide, ranged up five wide to vie for the lead entering the stretch, could not match strides with the winner the final
furlong, clearly second best. APRIORITY AVENGER back off the pace outside, loomed a threat when fanned six wide into the lane, stalled a bit in upper
stretch, finished a determined third late while not a threat to the top two. I'M A NIGHT TRAIN pressed early in the three path, vied while remaining three
wide and between foes exiting the turn, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker, weakened late to lose a couple of positions.
POPPA MAGIC bothered and forced to steady at the break, void of speed for a half as a result, staged a late rally to improve position late. VALLEY
MISCHIEF set or forced the pace for a half while between foes and weakened. PARKER NOW narrowly set the pace along the inside, gave way in the
drive. HEZA SEXY ZONG remained back in failing to threaten. RED IDOL finished early. INGLIS tired while racing inside.

Footnotes
FOR REAL ALICE behind the early pace inside, asked midturn, accelerated and knifed between horses to challenge into the lane, dueled upper stretch,
kicked clear under steady handling. SUMMERJUSTBET HER with the pace early closest to the inside, garnered a slightly larger advantage late in the turn,
responded when challenged by the winner soon after, raced on equal terms with that one past the furlong marker then could not keep up, all out to save the
place. TAPIT RIGHT broke back, outrun while along the inside, continued to save ground into and through the turn, rallied up the inside through the straight
to be getting to the runner up late. TAY TAY'S BABY back off the pace and the inside, displayed some mild late interest from between horses, not enough
for the show. AMARDINE off a step slow, void of speed for three furlongs, improved position up the rail to improve position. HARRIET'S DREAM in mid pack
and off the inside, came four wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a significant late kick. CHARLIE'S PEAK vied up front three wide for
three furlongs, weakened entering the stretch. WENDY WILECAT off a step slow, raced in the main body early, began to tire before three furlongs.
CONDESA'S HANDMAID with the early pace while between horses and outside the runner up, gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
MIKE J with the pace from the start, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, disposed of the other speed late in the turn to be clear into the lane, extended
that advantage past the furlong marker then had enough late to hold off the runner up. JAX MAN in the second flight early while outside, three wide into the
stretch, chased the winner past the furlong marker then was steadily getting to that one late under brisk handling. DRIFTER last away, raced back early,
angled out to be four wide into the lane, finished up willingly to be closing the gap on both of the top two. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE broke inward and a bit
slowly, void of speed up the backstretch, five wide and between horses exiting the turn, improved position without posing a threat to the top three. BINDING
AGREEMENT shuffled back toward the inside exiting the chute, remained back, fanned six wide turning into the stretch, bettered position a bit. LIFE IS A
BANQUET broke on top, alternated up front for over a half while inside the winner, first to blink. ALEXIS S in the second flight along the inside, came up
empty for the stretch run. CREOLE CHARLIE in mid pack and four wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. UNCLE FRANK in the second group
early, began a steady retreat before a half. CANADIAN PRIDE was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
MISTER CHAIRMAN closest to the leader, engaged that one to duel into the turn, floated out as a result of the loose horse inside, continued to duel into the
lane, shook clear with less than a furlong remaining, held the runner up safe late. BUCK DOLL TAYLOR forwardly placed toward the inside, bothered by the
loose horse into the turn, checked up in tight soon after, fell back, three wide into the lane, called on for run, closed well to be closing the gap on the winner.
TAPISTAR forwardly placed off the inside, remained with striking distance into the stretch, lacked a winning kick. EMPIRE KID broke on top, cleared early,
responded when the winner challenged into the turn, was carried out along with that one by a loose horse, regathered, dueled into the lane, began go
weaken nearing the furlong grounds. RANGER REX bothered to be off a step slow, moved up to mid pack, altered course to the outside in some traffic into
the turn, went evenly to the wire. F J'S FLACO off slow and bothered, raced back, saved ground to no avail through the turn in lacking a rally. CHARLIE'S
CREED broke in to bother a couple of inner rivals, raced back, had little for the drive. HARPES HILL was never a factor. ZAVALA hopped dramatically at the
break and unseated his rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
HEY MADALYN CLAIRE pressed the issue up front in the two path up the backstretch, fell back off the leader into the turn, continued to chase that rival
past the furlong marker, came again late to prove best while between the next two at the wire. SUMMER IS HOT fell back to trail, moved outside, five wide
into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. SERAPE broke on top, cleared to the inside, showed the way into the turn,
clear into and through upper stretch, faltered late. HOT PATOOTIE back off the early pace after breaking with the leaders, chased the forward two into the
lane, went flat to the wire to finish up evenly. MAGGIE'S RETURN went one paced throughout to also be found lacking in the late going. SUNSHINE STAR
off a step slow, was used to move up into a forward position for a half, faded down the stretch. THE GREY BEAUTY broke out, raced in the second group
outside, tired. ENOUGH HEART finished early, trailed home.
