ROYAL BONUS raced off the pace on the inside early, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and kicked clear.
BEBOP BABY pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and chased the winner
home late. ATLANTIC PRINCESS raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and
improved position in the lane. LYRICAL tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened in the final
furlong. WORKIN NINETOFIVE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the early going, came around the turn in the three path and was
outkicked in the stretch. WINDOW SHAKER led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and tired in the lane.
CELTICS WILDCAT stumbled and lost his rider leaving the gate, was caught by an outrider following the race and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY
WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

LOCK IT DOWN saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch and around the far bend and drew off in the stretch. BADGER KITTEN
raced in the two path early, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn and kept on to the finish. HURRICAIN
HUNTER saved ground around the first turn, tracked the pace setter on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and
finished evenly. A THOUSAND DREAMS raced in the three path around the first bend, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
far turn from the two path and weakened in the final furlong. MERLIN'S SISTER trailed far behind the field through the opening half mile, saved ground
around the turns and was not a factor.

SAINT SARENA dueled on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, shook clear in upper stretch and held that margin to the
wire. SAILING ALONG raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and
gained ground late. UNBRIDLED TWISTER bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated
the turn from the three path and kept on in the lane. MAMASHAVNAHOTFLASH tracked the leader on the outside through the early going, came around the
bend in the three path and weakened in the final furlong. ARTISTIC VISION raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the two path and never threatened. KIRA FEVER bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground
around the bend and made no bid. MISS MAC MAC bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
