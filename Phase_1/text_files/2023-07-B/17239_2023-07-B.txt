Footnotes
MAKE DECISIONS tossed his head at the start and broke outwardly and slowly, raced off the pace four wide, moved up three wide around the far turn,
closed outside and was up and clear late. BOLD ADVANCE raced in range four wide, moved up outside down the backstretch, continued on the four path
around the far turn, took over nearing the quarter pole, quickly drew off, remained well clear to the sixteenth pole but had little answer for the winner in the
later yards. RULE IT raced off the pace three and four wide and was along for the show. GREEN MILLENNIUM prompted the pace two wide between foes,
dueled inside of a pair in the two path around the far turn and faded through the lane. NOTARY SOJAC stalked the pace three wide, dueled down the
backstretch and between foes around the far turn and tired in the stretch. ADIOS YOUR HONOR set the early pace along the rail and retreated around the
far turn. STRAIGHT TIME was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. GALACTIC JACK played no factor while racing three and four
wide. ON THE RUNWAY hit the starting gate then bumped a foe at the start, raced two and three wide and made little further impact.

Footnotes
BUCCHERA raced prominently along the outer hip of the pacesetter in the four path, bid under confident handling in the three path rounding the turn, took
the lead while lugging out to the six path passing the eighth pole, and held sway. KOZEM stalked along the rail, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch,
and ran on between foes in the final furlong for place. GRAN TRICXY bumped twice with an outer foe at the start, then steadied just after, was behind in the
two path going into the turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. QUEEN HONESTY tracked in the five path, was
coaxed from the four path early around the turn, and finished evenly while back in the five path down the lane. MISS ATHLETIC set the pace in the two
path, was roused from the rail passing the quarter, but yielded in the two path passing the eighth pole. LETS GO KOKO broke in and bumped twice with an
inner foe, then had to steady after, chased in the six path but was no menace.

MISH set the pace in the two path, drew clear nearing the quarter pole and held clear under a drive. DESERT RULER trailed inside through the opening half
then rallied at the rail to gain the place. KLUGMAN tracked the pace in the four path and lacked the needed rally. SENSEI LAWRENCE failed to menace
while racing two wide. WALL STREET TRADER prompted the winner in the three path and tired after half.

Footnotes
PLUMA ROJA stalked in the six path, was cued to bid in the five path rounding the far turn, took the lead and opened up from the four path into the lane,
and was driven out while tipping inwards. BART'S DREAM was wellback in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and ran on
down the center for place. AMBUSHED brushed with an outer foe into the first turn, tracked in the four path, was coaxed early around the far turn, floated
out to the six path into the lane, and evened out for show. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER set the pace while behind the loose horse in the three path, was
roused midway around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. GOTTA GO GATOR laid off the pace in the two path but was no menace. BLUTO'S CANDY
brushed with an inner foe, clipped heels and fell into the first turn, and walked off. NO CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER THE STEWARDS HELD AN

RAIN had her head turned at the start, advanced inside down the backstretch, angled five wide near the seven-sixteenths pole, made good progress around
the turn, took over four wide turning for home and drew clear. SOPHIA'S STORM settled off the pace, advanced three wide around the turn and rallied
between foes to gain the place. RACE DAY SPEED had her head turned at the start, trailed early, moved up four wide around the turn and ran on to gain
the show. AWESOME ANNMARIE dueled three wide between foes and weakened in the lane. SIMPLIFY (ARG) bumped at the start, vied four wide for a
half, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole and faded. LA CHICA LATERAL had brief speed inside. IMPERIAL MOON disputed the pace in the two path
inside of foes and faltered in the stretch. NO DECAF was very rank at the start then bumped just after, raced three wide and never threatened. SCENIC
VIEW played no factor while racing five wide. KAEKO chased the pace two wide, faltered after a half and was eased in the stretch.

Footnotes
REBELDE raced off the pace in the six path, fanned out to the eight path while under a drive turning into the stretch, rallied past inner rivals, and was up
nearing the final sixteenth. RHYMES LIKE DIMES rated in the five path, was ridden along between foes in the seven path turning into the lane, and ran on
to place. CREATE AGAIN stalked in the five path, was roused to bid in the four path rounding the turn, tipped back out to the five path into the stretch, and
evened out for show. IT'S FATE chased along the rail, shifted out to the three path into the lane, but made no impact. STRAIGHT SHOT set the pace in the
three path, was nudged along rounding the turn, held on to the lead along the inside in upper stretch, but yielded just past the eighth pole. I'LL FIGURE IT
OUT was up close in the four path but weakened from the six path down the lane.

sixteenth. WICKLOW GAL set a rated pace in the two path, bumped the winner in upper stretch, fought on inside of that foe through much of the stretch but
was overpowered late. DULCE AMBICION trailed in the two path early, went four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. MISS UCRANIA
steadied at the start, raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the lane. ANGELIC STORM failed to menace while racing two wide. KILKENNY
BELLA chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. LEIPZIG raced in range two and three wide and had no response.

Footnotes
TRANSIENT (GB) got bumped by an inner foe at the start, rated along the rail, advanced inside of rivals rounding the far turn, shifted out to the four path
into the lane, drew past an inner foe nearing the final sixteenth, and cleared. CHICK'S SHADOW hit the side of the gate leaving, stalked in the three path,
waited for room inside rounding the far turn, angled out around the six path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. TO THYSELF B TRUE settled in
range around the five path, bid in the four path around the far turn, took the lead while in the three path turning into the stretch, but was caught by a pair of
outer foes near the final sixteenth to show. MIDNIGHT BELLA pressed in the four path, was driven between foes rounding the far turn, but flattened in the
stretch. THATAINT TOOSHABBY raced off the pace in the three path and made no impact from the five path down the lane. FLYING BLACK raced in
midpack from the two path but did not factor in the four path down the stretch. OCEAN SAFARI chased in the four path, fanned out to the nine path turning
into the lane, but did not threaten. FREE DATA tracked in the four path but weakened from the seven path turning into the lane. EMPRESS ELLIE set the
pace in the three path, was asked along the inside midway around the far turn, and yielded. GRATIA bumped with an outer foe at the start and was always
behind.

MAMA MARIA settled off the pace while racing five wide, stayed on the the left lead in upper stretch, finally switched over nearing the sixteenth pole, kicked
in and was up late. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC raced off the early pace, advanced two wide around the turn, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, rallied
inside, took the lead in deep stretch but was outkicked in final yards. SADIE BEAR set the pace in the two path until deep stretch and was caught on both
sides. BLACK ICE steadied at the start, raced well back in the three path, angled six wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. CHASING SILVER bobbled
at the break, stalked the pace in the three path and tired in the drive. GO LIL LADY raced in range four wide and came up empty in the stretch. SIENA
LADY broke a bit awkwardly and never threatened while racing three wide. SHEZA SPITFIRE was fractious in the gate and had brief speed inside.

CAJUN FANTASY vied outside of the early leader in the four path, took command early around the turn, opened up from the five path into the lane, and was
ridden out. STURDY GIRL chased inside, had to steady passing the half, was urged from the rail turning into the lane, and kept on for place. BUC N
BEAUTY tracked in the five path, was cued in the four path passing the three eighths pole, and was along for show. TALK MUCH dueled for the lead in the
three path but faded turning into the stretch. VAL'S GAL steadied at the start, raced off the pace in the two path, tipped out to the seven path into the
stretch, and did not threaten. VALIANT MISS broke in at the start, stalked in the three path but backed up early around the turn.
