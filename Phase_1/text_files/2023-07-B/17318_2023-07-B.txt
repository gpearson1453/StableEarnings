Footnotes
SING A LULLABYE took an immediate lead while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the five sixteenths pole and rounded
the turn at the rail, was steadily handled to late stretch then taken in hand approaching the wire. ELLIES AT WINDSOR was jostled at the break but closed
to contention and gave chase through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn and dug in through the stretch to hold second. LIL BUNNY gave chase,
raced three wide on the turn and was gaining on second every stride. IMINCHARGENOW chased through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then
flattened in the lane. AWESOME MOON came in and made contact with Ellies At Windsor leaving the gate, chased through the backstretch, rounded the
turn two deep while between horses and showed little in the lane. JUJU ON DA BEAT chased outside, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in
the stretch. LET'S DO THIS came out and made contact with Ellies At Windsor then gave chase inside, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened in the
lane.

toward the quarter pole, raced at the rail and was kept alert through the stretch. DIRECT THE CAT exchanged contact with Shewonttalktome leaving the
gate then gave chase, rounded the turn in the four path, was carried out approaching the head of the lane, but dug in from that point to clear second late
stretch. NAVY BAND broke sharply and set a pressured early pace, gave chase past the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the turn but drifted toward
the head of the lane and relented second later yards. HONESTLY OLIN'S bobbled and made contact with Shewonttalktome after the start and pressured
the early pace, dropped back past the three eighths, rounded the turn near the rail then flattened inside the eighth pole. SHEWONTTALKTOME exchanged
contact with Direct The Cat leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little more. FULL OF

Footnotes
WIDGET FACTORY contested the pace through the backstretch and dueled at even terms two deep on the turn, took the nod toward mid-stretch, raced
briefly clear then held on. NO FOOLING DUDE chased through the backstretch, raced close in the three path on the turn and finished well at the outside
girth of the winner. BE BE BOP came away awkwardly and contested a pressured pace, dueled at even terms at the rail on the turn, gave up the nod
mid-stretch then flattened later yards. BARRY KARAFIN BETS ducked out and made contact with Aw Ite leaving the gate then gave chase inside, raced
near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. WIZARD OF ODDS gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn at the rail, eased out leaving the turn
and ran evenly in the lane. AWESUMMER chased outside, was forced wider mid turn and showed little in the stretch. BUCKED TOOTH broke a step slow,
was shut off and was slow getting into stride then saved ground. AW ITE was bumped out leaving the gate then gave chase, checked from a narrowing
opening past the five sixteenths pole, angled to the six path on the turn, was carried wide toward the head of the lane and weakened. HELL'S KITTEN was
not a factor. STARSHIP TAXI chased toward mid track, was checked while bearing out midway on the turn, pulled up lame and was vanned off.

Footnotes
CEDARS BULLS EYE settled off the pace about the four path, improved her position leaving the half mile pole and bid toward the three eighths, took over in
the three path at the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn and was steadily handled through the lane. HOW IS SHE raced well off the pace and
off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, improved six wide on the far turn and dug in to take second later yards. HERETODAYGONMANANA
reared leaving the gate then saved ground well off the pace, started a bid at the nine sixteenths pole, steadily improved and raced close in the four path of
the far turn, but drifted into the lane and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. MY SISTER PAM settled in the three and four paths then saved ground on
the second turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn but flattened the final sixteenth. FORT ZANNA raced off the
rail early on, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path then flattened in the stretch. PRETTY
SPECTACULAR took the lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole, was met at the rail at the
quarter pole, continued close through the far turn but weakened into the lane. TAPPING SOUTH raced well off the early pace about the four path, left the
second turn outside and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the seven path on the far turn. TIZBIT rated close to the early
pace inside, started a three wide bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. GOLDEN SALLY stalked the early
pace, picked up the chase into the backstretch but faded leaving the three eighths pole.
