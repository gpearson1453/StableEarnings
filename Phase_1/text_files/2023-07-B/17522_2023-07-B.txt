Footnotes
CRYSTAL PROOF broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the quick pace into the turn, raced outside of rivals along the bend and was roused three
wide into the stretch, rallied nearing the furlong pole, overtook HER PERFECT VISION inside of the furlong marker, vied for the lead with LAGATHA to deep
stretch, found more in the final stages and inched away late to prove best. LAGATHA broke in a tangle and was away slowly, rushed up in the early going
and chased the fast pace while saving ground into the turn, advanced nearing the furlong marker while outside of HER PERFECT VISION, slipped back to
the rail in the drive, closed on the pacesetter while matching strides with CRYSTAL PROOF at mid-stretch, was outfinished by the winner in the final stages
and bested the rest. TIP TOP GAL chased the quick early pace from the rear, lost ground while three wide on the turn, was coaxed along four wide into the
stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final furlong but made up ground in deep stretch and was clear for third. HER PERFECT VISION broke a
half-step slowly, was sent leaving the break and assumed command in the early going, drew to a clear lead and set quick fractions heading to the turn,
showed the way to the quarter marker, came under pressure at mid-stretch, was overtaken inside of the furlong marker and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT allowed to settle in the early stages, was well placed while saving ground through the backstretch run, raced within striking distance along
the second turn, tipped three wide for the drive and was roused in upper stretch, ran in pursuit of ROISTER to the furlong pole, reeled in that foe inside of
the sixteenth-marker and drew away in the final strides to prevail. ROISTER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well handled through
moderate fractions along the backstretch run, showed the way while off of the rail into the far turn, slipped to the inside nearing the top of the lane and
extended the lead approaching the furlong grounds, was all out to hold off SUNNY SPOT nearing the sixteenth-marker, met that rival's bid to deep stretch,
grudgingly gave way in the final yards and held safely in the end for second. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE stalked the moderate pace while outside of rivals,
gained ground while widest through the backstretch run, mounted a four then three wide bid approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace to
mid-stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong, while holding for third. AWESOME DUDE was allowed to settled while outside of an inner rival, was not
far back through the backstretch run, trailed while saving ground along the far turn, advanced nearing the furlong marker but could not muster a final
response in deep stretch and finished evenly. BRONZE WARRIOR was prominent into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace into the backstretch run
and stalked ROISTER to the half-mile marker while between rivals, could not keep pace along the second turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
STATEFOREST sent to establish the early lead after an alert beginning, set moderate fractions while well handled through the backstretch run, was steered
to the two path in upper stretch, extended the lead at the furlong grounds, came under late pressure from the runner-up, responded to firm urging in the final
sixteenth and lasted for the win. CLASS CODE tracked the moderate pace while outside of rivals in the early stages, was roused three wide along the far
turn and came within aim of STATEFOREST nearing the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground to that rival in upper stretch and chased to the furlong marker,
closed in the final sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in the final stages and missed for the win, while holding safely for the place. BLUSHING
BAY was unhurried leaving the break, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, mounted a four wide rally into the stretch, closed willingly in the
final furlong, could not catch the top pair in deep stretch and held safely for the show. HARBOR ABBEY rated off of the early pace and tracked the leaders
from an inside position into the backstretch run, was asked to improve position and confronted STATEFOREST nearing the half-mile marker, raced a bit in
tight and slightly checked out of that spot nearing the far turn, chased from the rail to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed
response in the final stages and was outfinished for third. GOING TO SHABOOMS was prominent into the first turn, attended to the moderate pace through
the backstretch run, lost position while between runners along the far turn, chased into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.

ZEN STATE chased the solid early pace from the inside, took command along the turn, was confronted by MIRAGE CODE in upper stretch and battled with
that rival to the furlong marker, responded to firm urging in the drive, was kept to task to deep stretch and drew clear in the final stages in a good debut.
HALF THROTTLE took back off of the decent early pace and tracked the leaders to the turn, gained ground while three wide leaving the three-furlong
marker, came in tight midway through the bend, steadied and took up nearing the quarter marker then waited for racing room approaching the top of the
lane, came two wide for the stretch drive, was not able to make headway on the winner in the final sixteenth, stayed on in deep stretch and was up in time to
secure the place. MIRAGE CODE broke alertly, was hustled to the early lead and showed good speed into the turn, lost the lead to ZEN STATE nearing the
quarter marker, re-engaged in upper stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, gave way in deep stretch and was just edged for the place,
while just holding for the show. TWELVE VOLT settled outside of rivals in the early running, raced five wide into the turn and gained ground nearing the
quarter pole, shifted to the four path into upper stretch and continued that bid to the furlong marker, lacked the needed late response and was outfinished for
the minor awards. I'LL SMOKEM tracked the solid early pace while inside of an outer rival, raced four wide between runners into the turn and gained ground
nearing the quarter marker, swung widest and came five wide into the stretch, lost position nearing the furlong grounds and weakened in deep stretch.

BRONZE ONE broke alertly, opened to a clear lead in the early stages and set moderate fractions into the turn, drew off while in hand approaching the
quarter marker, was kept to task at mid-stretch while well clear and was hand urged in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. ANOTHER STRIKE chased
closest to the loose pacesetter in the early running, lost contact with BRONZE ONE along the turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and was
best of the rest. LUCKY RAPPER made contact with BANOG BOY at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the moderate pace while outside of rivals,
could not keep pace with the top pair in the stretch and just held for third. NOTCH lacked early speed, came four wide into the stretch run, lacked a
response in deep stretch and just missed for third. BANOG BOY hesitated leaving the start then made contact with a neighboring rival and was slow into
stride early while racing greenly, came two wide into the turn and improved position while saving ground nearing the top of the stretch, could not sustain that
run in the drive and did not factor.

MR. CLUTCH settled off of the fast early pace while not far back, saved ground into the turn and improved position nearing the quarter marker, was given
his cue leaving the turn and confronted DUMB LUCK in upper stretch, battled with that foe to the furlong grounds, responded to steady urging in the final
stages, shook free from the runner-up in deep stretch and drew away in the end. DUMB LUCK broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, showed good
speed while dictating terms into the turn, set a pressured pace while off of the rail approaching the quarter marker, was confronted by MR. CLUTCH in
upper stretch, battled with that rival to the furlong pole, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. PERFORMATIVE
stalked the fast early pace while outside of rivals, improved position while four wide on the turn, swung widest into the stretch and lost a bit of ground at the
furlong pole, chased the top pair into the final sixteenth, jumped a track in deep stretch and was outkicked in the late stages, while clear of the rest for third.
HAWK HILL was prominent in the early running and pressed the fast pace into the turn, inched closer to DUMB LUCK while three wide along the bend, lost
position in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. INDIANERA chased the fast early pace, raced outside of an inner rival along the turn, could not
keep pace into the drive and did not threaten.

PROOF OF JAZZ broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, drew to a clear lead along the first turn then rated kindly entering the backstretch
run and was well handled to the half-mile marker, set decent fractions to the quarter pole, was confronted in upper stretch by SHE'S SO SHINY and battled
inside of that rival to mid-stretch, lost the lead to SHE'S SO SHINY for a stride at the furlong marker, came again and dueled with SHE'S SO SHINY to the
sixteenth-marker, held a narrow lead into deep stretch and doggedly held off SHE'S SO SHINY in the final strides to prevail in a determined win. SHE'S SO
SHINY was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked PROOF OF JAZZ into the backstretch run, improved position and inched closer to that rival
nearing the half-mile marker, continued to gain ground while two wide along the far turn and drew to even terms with PROOF OF JAZZ in upper stretch,
battled to mid-stretch while outside of PROOF OF JAZZ and took a narrow lead nearing the furlong pole, dueled gamely while under firm right-handed
urging to deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while clear of the rest for second. BUSKER ALLIE took back off of the decent early pace, tracked
outside of an inner rival into the backstretch run and came within aim nearing the half-mile marker, chased the leading pair two wide along the far turn, was
not able to impact the top two in the stretch run but made up ground in the final furlong and was clear in the end for third. ST HELENA hopped leaving the
break and was off a step slowly, tracked the decent pace from a rail position through the backstretch run, lost ground along the far turn, could not keep pace
into upper stretch and weakened in the final stages.

DARK MYSTERY jumped shadows passing the wire for the first time then became hard to place through the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch while
racing towards the inside, tipped out going into the far turn then circled the field four to five wide into the lane, quickly seized the lead at the top of the stretch
and drew away in the final sixteenth. FANTASTIC DREAM stalked the decent pace while outside of an inner rival through the backstretch run, lost position
along the far turn and trailed into upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and kept on in deep stretch to be best of the rest. TITOS
WITH A TWIST was a bit slow into stride from the start then had to check hard near the finish line when DARK MYSTERY jumped shadows in front,
dropped to last then switched to the outside and made a four-wide forward move through the first turn to get on even terms with the duo tracking TACOMA
SOUND, launched a bid with a half-mile to go, caught the leader at the top of the stretch, could not match strides with DARK MYSTERY into mid-stretch and
weakened in the final stages while holding clearly for third. TACOMA SOUND stumbled sharply at the start and was off slowly, rushed up outside of rivals
into the first turn then cleared the field and set the pace while off of the rail into the backstretch run, set decent fractions to the half-mile marker, was
overtaken nearing the quarter marker, chased into upper stretch and came up empty in the final stages.
