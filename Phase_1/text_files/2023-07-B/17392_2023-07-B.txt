Footnotes
QUEEN VERRAZANO stalked pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, eased out and took aim in the four path, responded gamely and
drove past in final hundred yards. CAL away well, sent for lead two wide on the backstretch, continued dueling on the turn, NOISEY BURGLAR briefly
inched away in upper stretch, kept to task in the lane and came back to win the head bob for second. NOISEY BURGLAR away well, hustled to lead along
the inside, dueled for lead on the turn, coaxed midway through the turn, inched away in upper stretch, held narrow advantage with a sixteenth to go and run
down late. STARSHIP SKY off slow, lacked quickness and trailed on the backstretch, continued to trail on the turn and showed late run to get up for fourth
and galloped out well. COUSIN NIECEY tracked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued to track on the turn and into the lane, asked and offered
little in the lane. AUNTIE BEV tracked duo two wide on the backstretch, continued well placed on the turn and faded in the lane while widest.
