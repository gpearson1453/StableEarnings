CAIRO SUGAR prompted the pace outside, led into the stretch, moved briefly clear and held on gamely. IRIE EMPRESS settled off the leaders three wide
then closed willingly too late in the final furlong. PRINCESS SOPHIE settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out in midstretch and was up for the show.
FLASHNDYNAMITE led under pressure inside, vied to midstretch, resisted then weakened. BEACH DAZE broke alertly and dropped back inside, trailed,
angled out into the lane and lacked a response.

A WESTERN YARN rated inside, awaited room on the final turn, angled out advancing into the stretch and rallied ahead. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO far
behind early, swung extremely wide into the stretch and closed well. JOHN DUTTON settled close up in the two path then rallied gamely inside in the
stretch. BLINDING LIGHT alternated for the lead inside then ducked out tiring in the stretch. WINDSOR GOLD chased midpack in the two path and lacked a
solid rally. RABBIT raced within range outside and flattened out. RECYCLE forced the pace outside to the stretch and faltered. ROYAL KING prompted the
leaders three wide and began fading on the turn. WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS broke sluggishly and was never in contention. YOUNG SQUIRE broke a step
slowly, raced wide and was always far behind. MITROPANOS dropped back early and gave way readily.
