RUNAWAY A. TRAIN led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and pulled clear in the lane.
SAILSINTHESUNSET stalked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on to the wire.
FLASH FLOOD chased the pace setter on the outside early, began a bid from the three path coming around the bend and could not go with the winner in
the stretch but kept on to the finish. BRAHMS IS WHO stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and
weakened in the lane. SUNDANCE STAR pressed the pace between horses early, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the final furlong.
LILA'S LUCKY LADY trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. PEPPERMINT SISTER hopped up leaving the
gate, recovered to track the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and flattened out in the lane.

MAKE NOISE raced in the three path around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, drew off from the two path coming around the far bend and won
in hand. BARNFIELD saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two
path and gained ground late but was no match for the winner. BEAT THE HEAT hit the gate and was off slowly, saved ground around the first turn, raced off
the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and showed no kick. SARGE'S SERMON chased the leader on the outside
through the opening half mile, navigated the bend from the two path and faded in the stretch.
