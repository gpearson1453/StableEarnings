Footnotes
MISS MIEZIE bumped leaving, vied three wide to the opening turn, took pressure from SUDDENLY FAMOUS, and kicked clear in the stretch. SUDDENLY
FAMOUS broke outward bumping into MISS MIEZIE, was outsprinted to the turn, pressed through the final turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch,
and just held on for the place. SILKSTONE vied inside, dropped back in the turn, and closed gamely just missing out on a second-place finish. EL
CORRECAMINOS lagged early, angled inside then lodged a rail bid to improve her position late stretch. KULSUM hustled away, rallied mildly in the stretch,
and flattened out. DOUG'S HERO broke last, chased outside, and faded. HE TOLD AMY chased the pacesetters, and lacked a closing response.

Footnotes
AMBER PRINCESS saved inside, moved up closer into striking position, responded to right-handed urging to take command, and edged away. SWIFT
SWALLOW raced at the back of the field, gained quickly in the final turn while outside, closed well through the stretch, and got up in time to secure place
honors. THRILL OF THE NITE contested the pace inside of MOHAYMEN DAY, dueled leaving the final turn, and was run down late. MOHAYMEN DAY
raced five wide entering the backstretch, pressed the pace from outside, was unable to match strides into the stretch with THRILL OF THE NITE, and
flattened. PAULINA'S STAR rated off the early pace from outside, chased three-wide in the far turn, and came up empty in the drive. FOREVER LADY
chased mid-pack and failed to threaten. BEAUTIFUL BABE never reached contention.

Footnotes
JELLI saved inside, advanced quickly nearing the final turn, shifted out to the four path at the quarter pole, swept the lead, and was geared down in the final
sixteenth to prevail comfortably on the line. GOLDEN FORTYNINE took command quickly, showed the way through the backstretch, saw margins diminish
nearing the quarter pole, was overtaken into the stretch and finished up as second best. DRAMATIC FLAIR was unhurried early, chased inside through the
far turn, and was able to better her position in the stretch. QUEEN RHONDA raced in closest pursuit, gained ground on the leader into the final turn, and
flattened. LILBITSPICY rated well off the pace in the three path, and lacked a serious bid. SHAKINOFFTHERUST went four to five wide through the
backstretch, and failed to threaten. WOMANONTHEWARPATH failed to be a factor.

Footnotes
FORCE TO REKN WITH set the pace from off the rail under a snug hold, responded to a challenge from ROSE ROSE ROSE, drifted in at the head of the
stretch, straightened out, and edged clear. BIG HUG rated off the pace while three to four wide, raced in traffic leaving the backstretch, rallied entering the
stretch, and finished well to clinch second place. ROSE ROSE ROSE lacked a clear path leaving the gate, sat in striking position from along the rail, moved
up alongside FORCE TO REKN WITH nearing the quarter pole to challenge the front, steadied briefly at the head of the stretch then was caught in the final
yards. ECHO CREEK brushed leaving the gate, sat in range while inside, roused from outside at the head of the lane, and lacked the rally needed in the
drive. SUPER CARO went four wide through the opening turn, stalked outside, and had no response when called on. BOOTIFUL ROSE stumbled away
from the gate then pressed the early pace while five wide, was eased in the final turn, and walked off on her own accord. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An
objection lodged by the rider of ROSE ROSE ROSE against the rider of FORCE TO REKN WITH alleging interference a the head of the stretch was not
allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

Footnotes
FLORAL went to the front, showed the way while well-rated in the two path, remained unchallenged entering the stretch, drew clear, and was kept to task to
finish comfortably. MINE ME saved inside early, then shifted five to six wide entering the backstretch, moved up into striking position outside, chased the
leader while three wide, was kept under steady urging, and went determinedly through the stretch to earn her back second place position in the final yards.
TONE IT UP settled in range early, then took back in the backstretch while outside, asked to quicken nearing the three-eighths marker, drove between rivals
under handling, and wore down her inside foe for show. STEVIE WONDER GIRL bumped away from the gate, rated off the pace while four wide, chased
the leader into the lane, rallied inside in the final furlong, and gave way grudgingly. ORANGE THEORY went four wide through the opening turn, angled
inside in the backstretch, and offered a late mild rally. PLUM BLUE unhurried early, chased through the final turn, and came up empty in the drive. DANCE
SHOES bumped leaving, settled outside near the back of the field, was eased in the stretch, and walked off.

ITSALLGOODMAN broke outward into JODEYS LIL PAIN, pressed the pace while three wide leaving the backstretch, took over after the quarter pole then
kicked clear, was geared down after a glance under the rider's arm. THUNDER ROARS broke out leaving the gate, chased outside gaining closer order in
the final turn, was no match for the eventual winner in the stretch and finished willingly. JODEYS LIL PAIN squeezed out leaving the gate, saved ground
then gained closer contention in the final turn, and closed gamely late stretch. JAKOBS ROCKET BOY broke inward into CHICKS DIG CAPES, then vied for
the early lead, was overtaken shortly after the quarter pole and yielded in the stretch. CHICKS DIG CAPES bumped leaving, trailed the field leaving the
backstretch, and offered a late mild bid. WHY NOT DANCE bumped leaving, chased five wide and gave way. CAPE'S LEGACY fractious in the gate,
bumped away from the gate, chased outside, and faded. SIZZLIN ROSE vied between foes for the early lead, steadied inside on the opening turn and faded
gradually. THOROUGHBRED RULING #76- Take notice that horse #2 JAKOBS ROCKET BOY, is hereby disqualified and declared unplaced for having
raced in a Canadian-restricted race without being registered with the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society.

Footnotes
ALL THAT GOLD broke alertly to set the pace, turned back a challenge from MR. KALYPSO, drew clear and was kept to task. LIFESBEENGOODSOFAR
the saved ground inside then waited inside leaving the backstretch, shifted out to the five path at the quarter pole, loomed boldly at the head of the lane, but
was no match for the winner and finished well. UPO went four to five wide into the opening turn, settled in striking distance outside, rallied through the drive,
and held show. WYE CROSS rated well off the pace, responded to encouragement approaching the stretch, and closed well late. MR. KALYPSO stalked
the pacesetters from the four path, moved up alongside ALL THAT GOLD to press the issue, was unable to get back and weakened. FULL VELOCITY sat
in range from along the rail, lodged a bid nearing the quarter pole, and flattened out. PULL THE PIN unhurried early, raced wide through the backstretch,
and passed tiring foes. CARSON'S LEGACY sat in range while four wide, and came up empty in the drive. FLASHY SISTER trailed the field while wide,
closed the gap, and failed to be a threat. CHROME KING was wide into the opening turn, stalked outside in the backstretch, and retreated. VISION QUEST
was outsprinted to the turn, sat just off the pace from the three path, and tired early 3w.
