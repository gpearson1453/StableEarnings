clearly much the best. IRISH KITTEN was unhurried early then raced inside on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn and was making a bid but was
only second best. GRECIAN PHAROAH was unhurried early on and settled in the back of the field, rallied on the far turn and moved out to be three wide in
the stretch and was no threat. PAPA JIMMY stalked the pace while three wide on the backstretch, made a bid into the far turn then faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
REALLY GOOD was unhurried early then rallied on the far turn while saving ground, was in a long drive and powered to the front in deep stretch to be best
in the end. TEE AT ONE was allowed to settled then rallied three wide on the final turn to take command, drew off in upper stretch but could no last in the
end. FREEDOM TRAIL was allowed to settled then rallied on the far turn making a bid, but flattened out in the end. LOVE ME NOT stalked the pace while
two wide, dueled for the lad while two wide on the backstretch, then was in a long drive but faltered in the stretch drive. REGAL KINGDOM was unhurried
early then rallied four wide on the far turn and was no menace. PHILEAS FOGG set the early pace then dueled on the backstretch while inside, was used
up and gave way. OCEAN CITY chased the early pace while three wide, was used up then stopped.
