Footnotes
SASSY CINDERELLA stalked from a rail position, shifted out to the three path, took over at the head of the stretch and won driving. ANNA'S IMAGE sent
for early speed, sat just off the pace while three to four wide, chased in the final turn, and passed the tiring leader late for second. REBATE sat in striking
distance from the five path, dropped back in the far turn, and bid belatedly to score for show. THIS TIME SWEETIE set the pace from the two path, and
gave way at the head of the lane. LILBITSPICY was never far back, and failed to threaten in drive.

SHE LOVES WINNIN broke outward then contested the early pace, gained a slim lead over DAZZLING MIST, was under pressure late stretch, and just held
off rivals by the smallest margin after a multi-horse scramble to the wire. DAZZLING MIST returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment, pressed the pace
from a rail position, angled out three to four wide at the head of the lane, dug in deep stretch, and lost the nod after a determined effort. MIDNIGHT
GARDEN stalked the pacesetters, moved inside nearing the stretch and was outkicked, narrowly missing out. LITTLE HARPER squeezed out leaving the
gate, trailed and passed tiring rival. FLORIST bumped LITTLE HARPER leaving the gate, chased four to five wide, and faded in the stretch.

PUMP THE BRAKES was quickest to the turn, drew clear nearing the quarter pole, opened up through the stretch under confident handling, and was ridden
out while much the best. CHARMING VINTAGE bumped leaving, hustled away, dueled inside of CHRIS'S COMMAND through the stretch, and prevailed for
place honors. CHRIS'S COMMAND sat just off the pacesetter, dueled determinedly outside CHARMING VINTAGE, and lost the bob. SMART CAT reared
away from the gate, lodged a rail bid then flattened out in the stretch. AMEER came together with CHARMING VINTAGE, saved inside, shifted outside then
was brushed by RUN ROSSO RUN at the head of the stretch, and lodged a mild late bid. RUN ROSSCO RUN tracked in the four path, drifted out at the
head of the lane brushed AMEER, and yielded. CARAVAN PRINCE loaded without the rider, chased five wide and faded.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE GOLD broke alertly, trailed early from the five path, prompted action in the far turn, fanned four wide at the head of the lane, hooked up in a
battle with MUCHO MAGIC matching strides late stretch, and refused to relinquish control after a long hard drive. MUCHO MAGIC reserved off the early
pacesetters, was given cue when challenged by WHERE'S THE GOLD into the final turn, dueled inside through the stretch, dug in in the final yards but was
narrowly denied. DAD'S LEGACY dueled for the lead inside of PRESS GANG, dropped back in the final turn, and finished well for show. PRESS GANG
contested the pace, was unable to move on with rivals into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
BARAK was reluctant to load, vied hard outside for the early lead while crossing over quickly on the field, emerged the leader into the far turn, drew clear
into the stretch, and was kept to task. ADIOS Y GRACIAS vied inside, raced in tight quarters leaving the backstretch then was steadied, responded to
encouragement into the stretch, and held for second. BOBS BUDDY steadied from the run away from the gate, stalked three wide, dueled outside of ADIOS
Y GRACIAS through the stretch and was bested for second. TRAPEZE chased outside, and failed to threaten in the drive. TIMELY LIFE offered little.
RAUSTY TREASURE was shuffled back in the early stages, and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) quickly went to the front crossing over to the rail, drew clear in the far turn, was kept under steady handling into the stretch, and
was ridden out under a brisk hand ride. MONEY MUNCHER exchanged bumps with EL FANTASMA in the early stages, hustled outside then brushed
MOHAMED at the head of the lane, and closed late to get up for place. ABOVE AND BEYOND tracked inside, was brushed in close quarters leaving the
backstretch, rallied inside of SPORTSCARR into the stretch, and was caught late. ESCROW STYLE lagged early, circled wide at the quarter pole then
came together with EL FANTASMA, and rallied belatedly improving position late. MOHAMAD tracked outside in the five path early, was brushed after the
quarter pole marker, and finished evenly. SPORTSCARR chased from between foes in the backstretch, angled to the two path into the far turn, went in
pursuit of the leader, and came up empty for the drive. EL FANTASMA exchanged bumps at the start, stalked three wide then was squeezed out into the far
turn, started to fade brushing ESCROW STYLE, and retreated soon after.

Footnotes
FROSTEDBIRD fractious in the gate, vied hard outside for the early lead, dueled outside of PLUNGEINTOTHENITE leaving the backstretch, disposed of
rival nearing the quarter pole, and drew clear late stretch under a strong hand ride. BRODY'S PAL took back leaving the chute, tracked from the four path,
chased the leader into the stretch but was no match and finished up second best. REAL JUSTICE was checked leaving the chute, came under urging into
the stretch but was no match for the two top finishers. WIZARDOFMENLOPARK drove five wide, closed gradually under steady handling, drifted in, in the
late stages, and improved position. ZURI RISASI unhurried early, advanced inside through the final turn, rallied mildly in the stretch, and weakened late.
SUNDAY SUNRISE angled into the four path in the backstretch, and lodged a mild late bid. PLUNGEINTOTHENITE vied hard from just off the rail, dueled
leaving the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival nearing the quarter pole, and gave way. REMAIN CALM hustled away, and was outrun.
NIGHTFALL shifted out to the five path in the backstretch, and lacked a bid. PRENTON was outrun throughout. ARTHUR FONZARELLI never reached
contention.
