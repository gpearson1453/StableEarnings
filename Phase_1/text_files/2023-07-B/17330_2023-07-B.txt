URBAN MYTH tracked the early pace, advanced five wide through the second turn, made a bid on STEADY JOHN, dueled with that rival to late stretch and
held off the run of SWING LOW to prevail for the win. SWING LOW was allowed to settle early, saved ground early, angled out to the six path through the
second turn, was gaining fast and just missed. STEADY JOHN was up close early, raced four wide through the second turn, took a brief lead, met the bid of
the winner, couldn't match strides late and finished a game third. CANDY FOR CARMEL drifted in at the start, was void of any early speed, angled out
seven wide through the second turn and flattened out. SUMMER SILENCE was away alertly, set a clear early pace, raced along the inside into the turns
and faded.

the early pace from between rivals, drifted in and weakened. FIRST TO LAST set a pressured early pace, angled in and tired. BLACKWATER FALLS was
reserved early, went seven wide through the second turn and never fired. HARD MISSION was void of any speed, made a middle move along the
