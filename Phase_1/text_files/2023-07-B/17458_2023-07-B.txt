Footnotes
SPIRE was allowed to settle while racing two-wide, rallied four-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final strides. IRON ROB saved ground
stalking the pace, angled out to be three-wide at the quarter pole, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and then just failed to last in a game effort.
NATIONHEART saved ground setting the pace, responded when headed and held on fairly well during the drive for third. MANAALABOUTDAMONEY
prompted the pace from along the outside into the stretch and weakened. RIVER ROSE stumbled at the start, then saved ground while being reserved off
the pace but failed to threaten. SMOKE AND BURN was unhurried early, came five-wide into the stretch and was not a factor.
