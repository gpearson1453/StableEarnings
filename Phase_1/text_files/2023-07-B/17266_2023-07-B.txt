four wide move on the turn to vie for command, but flattened out the final furlong. OPTION was three wide into the first turn, vied for the lead three wide,

the lane and finished well on the outside, second best. HEY MA chased the winner on the inside and lacked the needed winning bid, held show award.
OPALINE chased the pace two to three wide and had no rally, even effort. LUNARCHY was bumped at the start, settled early, came four wide into the lane
and had no rally. BELLS OF JOY was reserved early and failed to respond. SHINY SHOES was through early.

MEDAL OF FACT was settled early, three wide on the turn, then closed well to hit the front late and edged clear, driving. MALIGATOR was off slowly,
settled in the back, came widest into the lane, then closed the gap fast late to gain the place award and gaining on the winner. MUD ISLAND stalked the
pace four wide, made a five wide bid off the turn to gain a short lead but was not enough and lost the place award on the wire. RISKY BOY was bumped st
the start, settled, three to four wide on the turn and finished well. KENNESAW was allowed to settle on the inside and needed more. GREELEYS ICE
tracked the pace and made a inside bid off the turn to vie for command by the furlong marker but flattened out. CHOPPER was bumped at the start, then set
the pace while clear, two wide on the turn and three wide into the lane, weakened the final furlong while drifting out. FOLLOW THE SIGNS broke out and
bumped a foe at the start, then checked between rivals leaving the five eighths marker, settled in the back, came five wide into the lane and was rallying but
checked by the sixteenth marker when the early leader drifted out in his path, tough trip. D'ARCHER was settled early, two wide on the turn and was not a
threat.
