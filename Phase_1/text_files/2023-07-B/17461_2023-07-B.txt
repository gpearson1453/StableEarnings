KAPALUA CANDY away well and saved ground through the first turn and controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch, continued to save ground

final furlong, but battled gamely two wide in the drive to prove second best. VISENYA away alertly and was taken in hand early and allowed to settle at the
back of the field, while saving ground at the rail entering the first turn, commenced her bid two wide from the back of the pack entering the final turn, and

VIVA LA VINO stalked the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, and

entering the final turn, and found her best stride while finishing four wide in the drive. BELCARRA PARK rushed to the lead two wide entering the first turn,
controlled the pace while one out from the rail in the run down the backside and into the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, but was
outfinished late while holding on for a share. REA MEA hopped at the start to get away awkwardly, before chasing the leader through the first turn while
racing just out from the rail, tracked the pacesetter two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the drive. LASTING

TIME TICKER settled at the back of a compact field while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from along the inside entering
the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and quickly took command in mid stretch to prove best. COUNTERACT away alertly and pressed the
pace from the outside of LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND entering the backstretch, struggled to keep tabs with that rival in the run to the final turn, rallied two
wide into the turn, and finished willingly one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND broke sharply and raced to the
lead from along the rail entering the first turn, sprinted clear in the run to the final turn, maintained her advantage into the lane, but was outfinished in the
drive while proving best of the rest. ENGLISH BAY TEDDY away well and chased the leaders three wide through the first turn, maintained his position in the
run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late going. BACK SHACK chased the leaders four wide into the first turn,
continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

SPACE broke sharply and tracked the pacesetter into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the leader two wide entering the final
turn, assumed command leaving the turn, and drew clear late under confident handling. DESIRED OUTCOME settled off the early pace while saving ground
at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed steadily two wide in the drive to prove second
best. STANFORD NORTH away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
battled into the final turn from the inside of SPACE, was unable to keep tabs on that rival leaving the turn, and faded in the late stages while proving easily
best of the rest. DREAMB stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but needed
more in the late stages when called upon. SHESBOURBONONICE trailed the field into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the

ARTISTIC JEWLER away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run
down the backside, tackled the pacesetter while commencing her bid two wide entering the final turn and quickly took command, held a clear advantage into
the lane, and widened late under confident handling. MISS THE HYPE broke sharply and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving
ground at the rail, held her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to prove
clearly second best. ANIMA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace through the stretch the first time
and down the backstretch, was tackled by ARTISTIC JEWLER entering the final turn, was no match for that rival midway through the turn, and faded late
while proving best of the rest. DONE THAT unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the back of the pack through the second turn and
in the run down the backside, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but was only able to pass a tiring rival late. RACINO stalked the leaders through the
