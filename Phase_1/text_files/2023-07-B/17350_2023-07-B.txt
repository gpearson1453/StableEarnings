Footnotes
WATER TO WINE prompt the early pace three wide between rivals, dug in near the eighth pole and prevailed under all out pressure. TAP THAT DIAL
pressed the early pace from the outside of foes, raced three wide through the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. BLUE PARADISE showed good early
foot from the inside to set a pressured early pace and weakened a bit through the drive. JUST BECAUSE was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack after
the poor start, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. WESTERN CHARM chased the early pace from the outside, hard ridden into the far
turn and lacked a bit while racing from the outside.

Footnotes
JOSE PATIO showed good early speed to set the early pace on an uncontested pace, ducked in sharply past the eighth pole, lost momentum, dug in
gamely and got up under strong pressure in a determined run. PROTONIC AND GIN settled to race mid pack early on, moved up four to five wide in the
lane and finished gamely to the wire. COLOR ME LEGENDARY rated along under a hold along the inside, moved up two to three wide in the stretch to take
aim near the eighth pole missed in game effort. MYSTIFIER settled off the early pace near the inside, hard ridden near the three eighths pole, angled wide
in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. NORTH ARM BAY dropped back early on, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and
had no final winning bid. SMART OXIE tracked the early leader while racing just off the iside and faded in the drive. GABRIEL'S LEGEND was off a step
slow, raced near the back of the pack early, checked near the eighth pole, raced two to three wide in the drive and never threatened.

BIG MUCKITY was sent clear to set the early pace, drifted through the stretch and held game under steady handling. P R CALL ME MAYBE chased the
early pace, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled to the rail and finished gamely to be second best. ALCAZABA (IRE) raced off the early
going, was three to four wide around the far turn and moved up in the drive to improve position. GOING AT IT tracked the early pace two deep, raced seven
wide into the upper stretch and weakened while racing off the inside. LOUIS was off a step slow, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. LOVE A FIGHTER
dropped back early on, raced along the inside around the far turn and had no response.
