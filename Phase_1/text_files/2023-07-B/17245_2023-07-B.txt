OUR FANTASY was fractious and very reluctant to load, broke a step slow, settled off the pace, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled with ROSE E
HOLIDAY, led into the stretch, edged away and drew clear under urging in the final furlong. ROSE E HOLIDAY stalked close up two wide, bid entering the
far turn, dueled with the winner, dug in gamely inside in upper stretch and stayed on well for the place award. BLIND SIGHT was bumped at the start, raced
close up on the inside, was in a bit tight entering the far turn, made a mild rail bid and then chased the leaders home. KNOT ANYMORE broke out bumping
a rival at the start, was rank in the early stages and drifted out, then set the pace in the two pat, dueled into the far turn and gave way.

sixteenth, dueled with that rival and prevailed at the wire. FAST MULE raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the
stretch, closed willingly inside, battled heads apart with BLETCHLEY GIRL in the final sixteenth and needed a bit more. LOST LUGGAGE stalked two wide,
moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied in upper stretch and was outkicked. HOLY BERRIES set the pace, drifted wide entering the first turn, then
dropped over to the rail, showed the way, dueled into the stretch and weakened. MYSTIC DREAMS turned her head prior to the start and was off slowly,
raced off the pace with an inside trip and lacked a rally. THEUNCAPTUREDLADY tracked close up on the inside, chased on the far turn, made a bid
entering the stretch, then weakened. SMART RED was outrun early, went three wide on the backside and failed to threaten. GENERAL ROBINSON was
floated four wide entering the clubhouse turn, then stalked two wide, chased on the far turn, steadied at the quarter pole while tiring and gave way.
