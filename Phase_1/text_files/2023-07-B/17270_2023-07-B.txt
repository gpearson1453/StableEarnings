was just up at the wire for the win. JET FORCE showed good early speed, set the pace racing with a clear lead, responded when roused, dug in gamely in
the final furlong and was nailed at the wire. SALSA RITA chased the pace from the outset, chased on the turn and finished evenly. TAKE CHARGE ERICA
was off a bit slow, chased two wide, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. RAINBOW TROUT raced off the pace inside and failed to threaten.
TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.
