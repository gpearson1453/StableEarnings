SONG OF PRAISE sped to the lead at the start and set the pace through early stages, held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and kept
clear under steady encouragement. BIZ B QUICK was off a step slow at the start and raced in the back, picked up the tempo three to four paths wide
around the turn, sustained bid into the lane and produced a solid finish. CAN'T MAKE ME tracked the pace into the turn, hustled along two to three wide into
the lane and ran on for a share. SWEET STROLL raced in range in early stages, hustled up along the rail on the turn, sustained inside bid into the final
furlong then flattened out. KYLIES HOPE raced in the back, came three to four wide into the lane and had no response. HOODWICKED was forwardly
placed soon after the start, chased the pacesetter around the turn then retreated through the lane.

ARCHAIC sped to the lead soon after the start and set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held clear around the far turn, came under a ride entering
the lane, responded willingly and drew off under a strong hand ride. BATTER UP BETTY secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the pace
setter up the backstretch, launched a rail bid near the quarter pole, ran on two wide through the lane and finished clearly second best. STREAKIN' EASY
raced three wide around the first turn and tracked the leader through middle stages, hustled along three wide around the far turn, failed to advance on the
top pair, weakened and ran along for a share. SIMMERING was forwardly placed around the first turn and up the backstretch, had no response when called
upon on the far turn and retreated through the lane.

FAKE SOLUTION was allowed to settle out of the gate and continued well reserved in the back, gained closer contention on the rail late on the far turn,
tipped three wide for the drive, steadily edged up closer and drew clear in the final sixteenth. INCITATUS broke on top and held clear around the first turn,
widened to a clear advantage running through the backstretch and remained clear around the far turn, rivals began to edge closer nearing the furlong
marker, kept under a drive and got out-finished in late stages. RECORDER rated off the top trio in a spread out field up the backstretch, picked up the
tempo along the inside on the far turn, sustained a rail bid through the lane and finished well clear over the rest. COOL CATOMINE was unhurried, hustled
along three wide into the lane and failed to move into contention. BIG HEARTED FACTOR stalked the clear leader up the backstretch, chased in the two
path around the far turn then faded in the lane. PARALISSFRMANALYSS steadied around the first turn then was the closest pursuer of the clear leader up
the backstretch, could not keep pace nearing the far turn and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
RIVERSPORT sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch and held clear still unleashed
around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, given cue for more, responded willingly, widened advantage and kept to task. GINGER RULES rated off
the clear top trio up the backstretch, edged closer along the inside late on the far turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid and
cleared second best. TWIRLING CHIEF was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, hustled along two paths wide
around the far turn, sustained bid into the stretch then flattened in late stages. COLE SPUR was unhurried and raced off the pace, circled up three wide at
the quarter pole then flattened out in the lane. APOLLO BAY was unhurried, came three wide into the lane and never menaced. SKYLINE tracked the leader
up the backstretch, came up empty mid-way around the far turn and steadily faded. WHONEW came up empty after a half.

Footnotes
SUBWAY SUSIE tracked the leader along the inside in opening stages, tipped out and hustled along three wide going by the quarter pole, sustained bid into
the lane and ran down CONVALIDATION in late stages. CONVALIDATION broke in top and set the early pace, held clear still unleashed around the turn,
cut the corner and given cue entering the lane, ran on with response but failed to hold off the winner in final stages. NO COST raced off the early pace,
hustled along three to four wide around the turn, ran on through the lane and secured a share. KONA KINLEY raced off the pace in opening stages, gained
closer contention along the rail late on the turn, cut the corner entering the lane, edged up closer near the furlong marker then flattened out. ARIZONA
LINDY was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased the leader two wide around the turn then tired in the drive. X RAY VISION showed response in
opening stages then steadily weakened.

Footnotes
MY BOAZ was ridden up to take a slim lead in opening stages and led the way by a narrow margin over FRANKLY EPIC, edged away to a clearer lead late
on the turn, saved ground entering the lane, came out a couple paths, responded under right handed pressure and finished clear. STAR OF MINE tracked
the top flight up the backstretch, made a bid three wide near the quarter pole, sustained a solid bid for MY BOAZ but could not reach the eventual winner
and had to settle for second best. LURCH tracked the top pair through early stages, was ridden along four paths wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid
through the stretch run and secured a share. DAY MONEY raced off the early speed, hustled up along the rail around the turn, tipped two to three wide for
the drive and had a mild improve. FRANKLY EPIC broke on top then conceded position to MY BOAZ and pressed the pace up the backstretch, hustled
along two wide around the far turn, ran on past the furlong marker then gave way. ACCELERITAS lacked early speed and raced in the back, was ridden
along three to four wide into the lane and failed to rally. SOLE SURVIVOR raced off the second flight near the half mile marker, chased three to four wide
around the turn, came wide into the lane and failed to move on.
