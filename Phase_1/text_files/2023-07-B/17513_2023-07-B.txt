CYCLONE ATTACK set the pace while in the two path, drew out on the turn and remained clear to the wire under a mild drive. FREDDY J was bumped at
the start, three wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive, angled out in the drive and had a late gain on the outside to gain the place award. MAN
ON ATTACK was settled early, inside on the turn, came off the inside and split rivals by the sixteenth marker and finished willingly to gain the show award.
FOLLOW THE SIGNS tracked the pace four wide and lacked the needed stretch bid. DANCE SOME MO chased the pace on the inside and cut the corner
leaving the turn but had no late punch. NULLARBOR prompted the winner early three wide, then tracked that rival two wide on the turn, came three wide
into the lane and faded. MAD DRAGON steadied after the start, then failed to menace.

Footnotes
SUMMER DAY was rated along two to three wide, split rivals leaving the turn and drew clear by the furlong marker, then held off R KATIEBUG late to prove
best, driving. R KATIEBUG was a bit fractious in the gate, rated along the inside, shifted off the inside leaving the turn and closed well towards the inside to
just miss. COWGIRL FRANKIE was off a step slow, reserved on the inside, came three wide into the lane and finished well. ROMANTIC ATTACK was
allowed to settle early towards the inside, moved out and made a four wide move on the turn and came five wide into the lane but flattened out the final
furlong. MOM'S TOWN set a pressured pace on the inside and then weakened in the drive. NIFF was settled on the outside and tired. FROSTED ECLAIR
pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn but tired.

Footnotes
POWER ALLEY prompted the early pace three wide, then stalked the pace on the turn three wide, made a bide off the turn and drove clear in the furlong
grounds to prove best, driving. LARRY THE POET set a pressured pace between rivals, then shook clear on the turn in the two path, then was headed by
the winner by the furlong marker and could not go with that rival, clearly second best. WIN THE CUP was reserved early, moved up five wide entering the
far turn, made a four wide move on the turn but flattened out, bested rest. BLACK RAVEN was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the lane and
had no rally. STROLLNTOTHEMARKET pressed the pace on the inside and weakened. SECRET HONOR broke in the air at the start and trailed early,
came five wide into the lane and improved while racing greenly. LIL RIVER was off a step slow, chased the pace on the inside and weakened. AMBER
EDGE was mid pack early between rivals and stopped on the turn. MAX A MILLI chased the pace four wide and in between rivals and then stopped badly
nearing the quarter pole, vanned off.

Footnotes
APRIL'S GEM was well rated early on the inside behind the duel, made a three wide bid on the turn, hit the front off the turn and was clear by the furlong
marker, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best. GET N TIPSY hesitated at the start, then saved ground while being reserved, advanced on
the turn on the inside, steadied slightly by the quarter pole, then was blocked nearing the furlong marker, angled out for racing room, then lost the crop and
tried to use glove to strike horse, then angled out more and closed the gap fast under a vigorous hand ride late, tough trip. EMBARRASSING was settled
back early, came wide into the lane and was up for the show award on the outside. STACY ATTACK dueled for the lead two wide, made a bid to shake
clear on the turn but weakened in the final furlong. KITTEN ROCKS was reserved while three wide but had no late punch, even effort. NO NANNETTE NO
was allowed to settle on the inside, advanced on the turn and had to steady slightly by the quarter pole, shifted off the inside for racing room and then was in
traffic by the furlong marker and had no rally. MY LADY SLEW dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened. ZANDREA'S was reserved early and lacked
a rally. AUNT STELLA failed to menace. CELESTIAL SPIN showed little.
