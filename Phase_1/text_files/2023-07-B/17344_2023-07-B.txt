Footnotes
BOLD MISTRESS was sent to establish the early advantage, was well handled through decent fractions to the quarter marker, drew off into the stretch and
was kept to task to the wire to prevail as much the best. RIVIERA SUNRISE chased from the inside, was not able to impact the winner in the drive, was able
to close a bit of ground in the final furlong and bested the rest. JERSEY BIRD chased from midflight while outside of rivals, was steered three wide into the
stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong, was outfinished for second and held for third at the wire. ENGEE OMBEE lacked early speed, was coaxed
along four wide into the stretch, lacked the needed response in deep stretch and missed for third. MANY MARKETS was prominent in the early stages,
stalked the decent pace along the turn, could not match strides heading to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
LESSONS OF AUTISM stalked the decent early pace while between rivals, slipped to the rail along the turn and was well placed at the quarter marker, was
roused four wide into the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong pole, overtook WOUND UP at the sixteenth-marker and drew away in the final stages.
WOUND UP was asked for early speed and dictated terms into the turn, was pressed to the quarter marker then shook free into upper stretch, was
overtaken by LESSONS OF AUTISM at the sixteenth-marker and held for second at the finish. ZIPPY BABY raced close to the early pace while outside of
rivals, pressed WOUND UP to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into the stretch, remained within striking distance to the sixteenth-marker, was
outkicked in deep stretch and missed for second, while clear for third. HARBOR SKY bobbled at the start and was off slowly, chased from the rear along the
turn and lacked a late response.

DERRYGOOLIN broke alertly and assumed command at the start, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, held a narrow lead to
the quarter marker, shook free into upper stretch, dug in under firm urging inside of the furlong marker, felt late pressure from the oncoming runner-up and
lasted for the win at the finish. BOLD DAUGHTER was unhurried while not far back in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch
run, chased outside of runners along the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, made a steady advance inside of the furlong marker, rallied in deep
stretch and missed for the win, while clear of the rest for second. MOMMA MOCCA was forwardly placed while outside of rivals into the first turn, prompted
the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost a bit of ground heading to the quarter marker, chased DERRYGOOLIN to mid-stretch, weakened in the
final stages and was outfinished for second, while clear for third. BLUSHING BAY stalked the pace into the first turn then took back to settle through the
backstretch run, swung widest into the stretch, raced in the five path in the drive and did not threaten in the final stages.

Footnotes
SATANTA tracked the decent pace from the inside, angled three wide nearing the top of the stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker, overtook
GREAT STORY nearing the sixteenth-pole and drew away in a drive in the final stages. GREAT STORY broke alertly and showed good early speed, dueled
with ZHIVAGO to the turn, took a narrow lead along the bend while carving decent fractions, drew to a clear advantage into the stretch, could not hold off
the winner inside of the sixteenth-marker and held well for second at the finish. PAPAPIFAS stalked the decent early pace, advanced outside of rivals on the
turn, was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, was outfinished in the drive and held clearly for third. GRIT AND CURIOSITY chased the decent pace
from the inside, gained ground into upper stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and finished evenly. MOUNT PELLIAR broke awkwardly
and was off slowly, chased outside of a rival through the turn and did not threaten in the stretch. ZHIVAGO pressed the solid early pace, kept close
attendance to GREAT STORY to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
DADS DREAM broke alertly, took back and raced close to the decent early pace, stalked the leaders three wide approaching the quarter marker, was
roused into upper stretch, took command at the furlong marker, drew to a clear lead inside of the furlong pole, drew off under moderate urging nearing the
sixteenth-marker and was geared down in the final stages as much the best. MIRAGE CODE was bumped leaving the break and was off a step slowly, was
hustled in the early stages and showed speed to take a narrow lead into the turn, set decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, was overtaken by
the winner heading to the furlong pole, was no match for DADS DREAM in the final stages and bested the rest. DAD'S JUBILEE pressed the decent early
pace, kept pressure on the MIRAGE CODE while between rivals into upper stretch, could not keep pace with the top pair into the drive and weakened late,
while holding clearly for third. SPIDER PIG lacked early speed, saved ground to the top of the stretch and did not threaten. KLIMT A. P. broke in soon after
the break and bumped MIRAGE CODE, chased the early pace while outside of rivals, was coaxed along three wide into the lane and did not factor.

PERFORMATIVE broke alertly, took back off of the fast early pace and stalked outside of rivals into the turn, advanced four then three wide along the turn,
took command in upper stretch, held a narrow lead to the furlong grounds, jumped a track in deep stretch and kept to task in the final stages to prevail.
COBRE chased the solid early pace while widest into the turn, improved position four wide nearing the quarter marker, continued to gain ground at
mid-stretch, finished evenly in the final furlong, could not reel in PERFORMATIVE in the late stages and held safely at the end for second. NUESTRO
ENGREIDO showed good early speed and set a fast pace while pressured into the turn, held a narrow advantage to the quarter marker while carving out
quick fractions, stubbornly battled against PERFORMATIVE to mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages, was outfinished for second and just held for third.
MEDAL ICE chased the fast pace from the inside, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and flattened out in the final stages.
DOGE OF VENICE was prominent in the early running and pressed the fast early pace while outside of NUESTRO ENGREIDO, lost position nearing the
quarter marker, could not keep pace into upper stretch and gave way. DADDY'SDARLINGBOY chased the fast pace, raced outside of a rival to the quarter
marker and lacked a response in the stretch drive.

ANITANEWMERCEDES broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set decent fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, was
headed by SUPERMAZEL at the quarter marker, re-established the lead in upper stretch and took a narrow advantage to the furlong marker, gamely battled
to deep stretch while inside of SUPERMAZEL and determinedly prevailed at the finish. SUPERMAZEL was forwardly placed into the first turn and stalked
the pace into the backstretch run, prompted the decent fractions to the half-mile pole and drew to even terms with ANITANEWMERCEDES at the quarter
marker, dueled with that rival to the furlong pole, made a steady gain in deep stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and bested
the rest. ENOS SLAUGHTER settled off of the early pace, raced four wide along the first turn and maintained that four wide path through the backstretch
run, gained ground while four wide along the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch while within aim, could not muster the needed late response and just held for
third. SECRET CLUB tracked the decent fractions from a three wide path, made a steady gain through the backstretch run and came within aim nearing the
quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the stretch and weakened in the drive. SEA OF LIBERTY was allowed to settle, saved ground through the
backstretch run while not far back, swung five wide for the drive and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
LIL MIRACLE MAN broke best and was content to cede the early lead to IL CAPITANO then tracked well behind to the half mile marker, launched a bid with
three furlongs to go, collared the pacesetter in the stretch and held sway under firm handling. IL CAPITANO broke a step slow then hustled to bid for the
lead going into the first turn, took command passing the seven-eighths pole and went unchallenged on the lead, widened while under a snug hold down the
backstretch, responded under pressure when confronted by the eventual winner at the top of the stretch, was unable to match strides late but finished well
enough to hold the place. LOOKIN FOR REVENGE allowed to settle early, held position down the backstretch but well behind the early leader, began a rally
from the three furlong pole and ran on somewhat one paced but good enough to hold third. LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) devoid of any speed in the early going,
started a run from the far turn that carried wide into the stretch and ran on well down the middle of the track and came up just short of a minor award. POUR
ON THE COLE tracked to the outside LOOKIN FOR REVENGE down the backstretch, came under pressure on the far turn and was outrun from there.
