Footnotes
AWESOME BID went to the front to set a pressured pace, was headed at the five sixteenths pole, dug in to draw clear and just lasted. A GEM IS A GEM
tracked the leaders to the middle of the turn then angled out to two or three wide at the quarter pole and moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole,
bumped with outside rival but kept on for a late run but was not enough. LAUNCHED vied for the lead from three wide to the middle of the turn then
engaged the leader nearing the five sixteenths pole and match strides to the three sixteenths pole and tired. JUSTIN SPEIGHT prompted the pace to mid
turn and gave way. SEEULATERGATOR was off the pace in the two path to the quarter pole, moved out to four wide in upper stretch and was bumped by
inside rival but lacked a late kick. CREATIVE LETTERS had no early speed, made a mild bid in the stretch but was not a factor.

MILLI STARR was hustled to the lead, edged away around the turn and just lasted. DOZO vied for the lead from three wide, made a late gain to be second
best. NEW YEARS LOVE prompted the pace in the early stages then moved between horses at the eighth pole to fight gamely in the stretch and missed the
place. AUNT IRENE was off the pace down the backstretch then fell back on the turn, moved out to four wide but floated out to mid track in upper stretch
and improved position. SWEET TATUM was off the pace on the inside then made a mild bid in the stretch but faltered. RAGING LADY was close up while
racing wide through the turn and was not a factor.

COCKTAIL SLIPPERS was rushed up to the lead then was headed at the quarter pole and dueled down the stretch, cleared late and held on. TRULY A
MESS stalked the pace through the turn then made a late rail bid and just missed. DREAMER GIRL pressed the pace to mid turn then moved to engage the
leader at the quarter pole, dueled down the stretch and gave way grudgingly. WHISTLING HOME was last to the turn then moved up from five wide around
the turn, made a mild gain in the stretch but was not enough. PRINCESS JAYLEEN tracked the leaders from the two path, made a three wide bid at the
three furlong marker but lacked the late response.

Footnotes
PODEROSO EQUS roused to a pressured lead to mid turn then edged away to be an easy winner. RANCHER hopped leaving the gate then moved up the
rail through the turn, angled out to three wide at the eighth pole to be a clear second. TOMBI tracked the leaders to mid turn then moved out to three or four
wide in upper stretch to be along for the show. GOLD NOTE saved ground through the turn then moved out to mid track to make a late rally.
MASTERPIECE DAY pressed the pace from the two path to the top of the stretch and gave way. KICK IT stalked the pace from three wide to the quarter
pole and weakened. ARIMONY was always back.

GIMME SPACE stalked the pace to mid turn then slipped through at the five sixteenths pole and drew off. KEENEYE GEORGE co-led from the two path to
the five sixteenths pole then was eclipsed at the quarter pole but made a rebid to be second best. PRINCE OTTO was forwardly placed in the three path to
mid turn then angled in at the five sixteenths pole but was no match for the winner. OH SNAP trailed the field through the turn then made a late rally and just
missed the show. MY PAL raced in the middle of the pack to the top of stretch then tucked in to the rail at the three sixteenths pole but faltered.
PARABELLUM co-led from the inside to mid turn and tired. CLAIMJUMPER was last away then moved up from six wide down the backstretch, kept on four
or five wide on the turn but failed to sustain the bid. NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST was off the pace in the two path to the seven sixteenths pole and
retreated.

MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground down the backstretch then moved out to three wide on the turn to engage the
leader in early stretch and drove past to clear late. COWGIRLLOVER rushed to a clear lead to the quarter pole then was collared nearing the eighth pole but
stayed on to prove second best. SPARKLE IN THE SKY stalked the pace from three wide around the turn then engaged the leader at the eighth pole but
was empty and chased the top two home. WHEREDIDITGO raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved between horses at the three
furlong marker and tucked back inside at the quarter pole to be best of rest. KINSLEYS SWEET PEA had no early speed through the turn then moved out to
four wide in early stretch to make a rally and improved position. BIG CREEK FIRE stalked the pace from four wide down the backstretch then moved in to
two wide on the turn but failed to menace. PIZZA GIRL was forwardly placed down the backstretch then fell back on the turn and was not a factor.
ATHENIAN PRINCESS saved ground to no avail. ITHOUGHTIKNEW tracked the leaders on the backstretch then dropped back. DANGERELLA was never
a threat.
