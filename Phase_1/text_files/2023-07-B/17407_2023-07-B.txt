Footnotes
LOVELY JOYCE vied for the lead, got to the rail and stayed on the fence as he led in a set of five across the track, took advantage of the shortest way to
the wire and was able to pull ahead and lead the race alone through the turn, showed the way into the stretch, putting more distance between himself and
the field and drew away scoring a wire to wire win. TWISTED BRADE was off in mid pack, raced four wide, advanced up, edged out at the three eights pole,
found room and split horses, shifted out into the seven path in the upper stretch, continued to closed, continued to build momentum with each stride, closed
well drawing near, but could not over throw the winner today, ran a game second. BOLD EXAGGERATION vied for the lead, raced two wide, was in a set of
five across the track early, raced even and had no late rally. BODI ODI vied for the lead, raced in the three path in between horses, stayed right off the
leader racing with another foe to the inside, was well placed and in contention at the quarter pole but faltered in the stretch. ABBEY CAKES vied for the
lead, stalked the pace, but made no impact. MILU ROCKET raced three wide maintained position but never got involved. TEKANA mid pack, raced four
wide, circled widest through the turn closed then tired. SECRET MOMENT showed little. MISCHIEVOUS ME was no menace. LIL PARTY CRASHER
missed the break and never got involved.

WILLIAM GUSTAVO vied for the lead, raced on the rail and set the pace, was determined to keep the lead, was kept on point and driven in the stretch drive,
continued to run down the lane and was able to score the win. CADILLAC COWBOY vied for the lead, settled into a stalking position in the three path,
stayed right off of the leader on the outside, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, drew close to the leader at the quarter pole, could not sustain the bid
or stay with the eventual winner but stayed on and was able to get second place money today. WINDTAPPER WIN was in the middle of the field early,
raced in the four path, improved position, launched a bid after the half mile pole, circled the field through the turn, then chased the front runners through the
stretch getting up for third. YOUNG JONESBORO raced mid pack, stayed on the rail, launched a bid at the three eights pole, loomed near the front, shifted
out in the upper stretch, then struggled to switch leads and lugged in down the stretch finishing flat. ROULETTE raced off of the pace in the four path,
launched a bid at the three eights pole, shifted into the eighth path, closed down the stretch on the far outside, out finishing the rest. STAR READY vied for
the lead, stalked the pace in hands, raced in the two path but made no impact. SPOONMAN was well off the pace, shuffled back to last, raced on the rail,
saved ground through out, made one run gaining ground but had too much to do. WINNING DANCE stalked the pace from the rail, saved ground, was in
contention but had no kick. STRIKE A BARGAIN was off slow, wound up last, raced on the rail, found her best stride late. HALEY'S BEAU raced mid pack
early but made no impact. NATIVE MOONSHINE was no menace. LEVY BILL showed little.

Footnotes
VALDINA DREAMS stalked the front runner from the three path on the outside in the second tier, challenged and took command at the quarter pole, cleared
the early leader and hook another closing foe who was racing on the rail, battled, got up in time. KNOCK'EM OUT JERRY vied for the lead, set the early
fractions, battled and just missed. STRUTTIN APRIORITY was mid pack, raced on the rail, and ran even. EGOR OTAY raced on the rail in the middle of the
field but made no impact. ROCKALL raced from off of the pace, was in the three path and was never involved. FREEPORT showed little. ALWAYS HAVE
PARIS trailed through out.
