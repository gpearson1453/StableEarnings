Footnotes
UNBRIDLED FOX stalked the pacesetters while in the three path, moved to press the pace two wide through the turn, bid into the lane from the three path
then drew away through the lane. NEVER TO MANY HUGS set the pace while under pressure down the backstretch while in the two path, dueled with the
winner into the lane, was no match for that one when straightening into the lane then stayed on to be far clear for the rest. NEW YEAR'S DELIGHT was in
the two path through the turn when between rivals and never far back, bid into the lane to gain the show spot while never a threat to the top two.
LIZZSAIDNO pressed the pace two wide into the far turn then tired. C F V TU BRUTUS hopped and threw her head at the start, raced off the rail down the
backstretch and into the far turn, bid four wide in mid-turn and was done entering the lane. LUSH BE A LADY raced along the inside through the turns when
losing ground, shifted into the five path for the drive and not a threat. SHES MY TREASURE raced three wide through the turns and was empty into the
lane.

BALLOT INITIATIVE was unrushed early, stalked the pace in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, dueled outside in the stretch and prevailed under
mild urging. FREDERICIA was brushed at the start, dueled outside of a foe, bid at the three-eighths pole, then dueled inside of the winner and was
outfinished. DALTON'S LOVE stalked the pace in the three path, then had no late bid. SHE RANUP THE AMEX was checked into the first turn when a rival
came over, then was not a factor. TAYA ALLDAYA was quickly over to duel inside, then gave way on the far turn. WRAPPINJUSTICE stalked the early
pace in the four path, bid at the five-eighths pole, pressed between foes, then gave way.

Footnotes
DAVID'S TUITION chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane from the four path, gained a clear advantage once straightened,
drifted in to the two path and remained clear. FAVORABLE RETURN raced along the inside throughout and was gaining along the rail. ACTION SEEKER
pressed the early pace from near the inside, shifted into the three path in late turn, continued in the five path for the drive and remained clear for the show
spot while not a threat late. A LOT LIKE LUTE was in the two path through the turn, was in the three path into the lane and gained belatedly. WHOOP
GONE was brushed at the start, hustled up to clear for the early lead, widened in late turn then gave way straightening in the lane. BREAKOUT STAR never
a factor while in the three path through the turn. SOUTHERN HEMI was first away and moved to chase the early pace from the three or four path, began
losing ground approaching the turn and continued to fade.

MCMONEY was unrushed inside, angled five wide at the quarter pole, rallied late and was clear under steady handling. TIMELY PROSPECT raced inside,
bid in the two path between foes in early stretch but was no match for the winner. SATURN BOY stalked the pace in the three path, bid four wide at the
quarter pole, then faltered. FACE VALUE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace in the two path under wraps, bid at the quarter pole, then gave way in
the stretch. ONE LUCKY DAY bore in at the start, led inside, then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
BRIGHT BRIAN pressed the pace two wide through the far turn, bid into the lane, gained a clear lead outside the eighth pole and held while being kept to
the task. TAKECHARGEJUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, bid four wide through mid-turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and rallied
from mid-track. MUSTY RED unhurried while off the inside, bid three wide through the turn and into the lane, moved closest to the winner with an eighth to
go then could not sustain the effort while finishing well clear for the show spot. KILLER HOTROD was along the inside through the turn, shifted from the two
to the four path through the lane and never was a threat. JUANCHO set the pace under pressure through the far turn then gave way when straightening in
the lane. COWBOY IMAGE never was a factor while in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never factored
while losing ground late. LOOKING GOOD LEWIS chased the pace while near the rail into the far turn, was close up nearing mid-turn then was empty
turning into the lane. JUSTICEONEMORETIME was bumped entering the first turn, raced off the rail when never far back entering the far turn then was
done near the five-sixteenths pole. WISHY WASHY trailed from the outset while in the three path and was eased to the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
ITZFOREVER was unrushed early, rallied six wide at the three-eighths pole and was clear late under steady urging. CLASSY DREAM stalked the pace in
the three path, dueled through the stretch but yielded late. GIO'S BABY GIRL saved ground, bid in the five path at the quarter pole and lacked a late bid.
SHAKIN IT UP BABY bid between rivals in the stretch but was no threat. PANTALONES ENFUEGO stalked the pace in the three path, then lost the path in
early stretch. CHIMES stalked the pace in the two path, then faded in the stretch. B FLAT OUT was clear early, then faded in the stretch. BRODY MO
stumbled at the start. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE bobbled the start. JACK'S SUMMER raced in the three path but made no bid. HONEY RED stalked the
early pace in the six path, bid in the three path at the three-eighths pole, then faded through the stretch. CASTLE MAGIC stalked the pace inside, then
faded on the far turn. The Stewards disallowed an objection by the rider of PANTALONES ENFUEGO against GIO'S BABY GIRL alleging interference in the
stretch.
