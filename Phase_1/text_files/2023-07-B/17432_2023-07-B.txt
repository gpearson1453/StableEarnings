outside, angled in to the two path and moved up through the turn, came through on that path into the lane and flattened the final furlong. T C GREELEY led
in the early going, stalked the winner through the turn, bid outside of that one into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. GOODTIME ARTIE allowed to
settle, looped up four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. LEGIO mid pack, steadily lost ground. BOURBON OVER

GUACO fractious in the gate, was unhurried, early, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that path, angled out for clear racing
room, made a steady gain and edged ahead in the final strides. HENRY'S WORLD sprinted to a clear lead inside, drew off through the turn, then was
outfinished. JARETH tracked the pace back, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then weakened in the late going
and held the show. GREAT BLAKE well placed and off the rail, looped up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and lacked the needed
late kick. HE'S ON THE FLY stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and
flattened out. EXTRA MEDIUM allowed to settle, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. WAPITI WAY
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and ran evenly. WORBOTHOR mid pack, moved up three wide
through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had no rally.

three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and closed the gap on the winner late. KEEN ON ME well placed and off the rail, held position
on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. SGT RECKLESS USMC mid pack, saved ground on the
two path through the turn, angled three wide into the stretch, then drifted in and held a share. SAINT FOXY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through
the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and missed a share. ORGANZA allowed to settle, looped three and four wide through the turn,
