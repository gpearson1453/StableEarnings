Footnotes
GRACIE'S A TIGER sprinted away to set all the pace and proved much the best. STARLET COLE raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then moved up
from three wide around the turn but was no match for the winner. IMA HOT TOTTIE prompted the pace from the two path to the three furlong marker and
flattened out. AUNT CARI had no early speed, saved ground around the turn and moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole to improve her
position in the stretch. CANDIED JOULE was always back. GOSPEL GLORY saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
DIXIEMAGIC raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch then moved up from three wide around the turn and dug in in the stretch, took over in
deep stretch and drew clear. BORN TO RACE was last away, steadily advanced up the rail through the turn, rallied by moving out to two wide at the eighth
pole and tipping out to three wide at the sixteenth pole but was too late. EUSEBIO rushed up to a clear lead to the eighth pole then was collared in the final
sixteenth but was a game third. GO LAKER GO tracked the leaders from off the rail on the backstretch, dropped back around the turn, angled out to four
wide in upper stretch but was empty. MUCHO GIFTED was off the pace to the top of the stretch and tired. BUMPER POOL was never involved. CHARLIE'S
NO SAINT was outrun.

BULLAWAY was forwardly place down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the turn to run down the leader in deep stretch and drove past. NO
LIMITATION was within striking distance down the backstretch, then took the lead at the quarter pole but was caught in deep stretch but was able to hold off
the late closing rival for the place. WILLTOBELUCKY was allowed to settle around the turn then moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late rally but
was too late. HAWKWOOD had to check early to avoid the loose rival but kept on to press the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened. GREY ROGUE
went to the front to set a pressured pace to the top of the stretch and tired. FLY BUDDY FLY was never a threat. DIVINE TASK reared as the gates opened,
lost rider and walked off.

SHE'S MY RIDE shared the command from between horses for the first quarter then edged away to a clear lead, was challenged at the quarter pole but dug
in and drew off in the stretch to prove best. ALL NATIVE had no early speed and trailed the field to the three furlong marker then made a three or four wide
bid, tipping out to four wide in upper stretch and made a late rally. DIVA'S DIVA vied for the early lead from the inside to midway down the backstretch then
fell back around the turn, made a rail bid in the stretch to pass tiring rivals and be up for the show. AMERICAN REALITY stalked the pace down the
backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn but faltered. D'WILD MUFFIN had good early speed and shared command from three wide for the first
quarter, then pressed the pace to the three furlong marker, moved to engage the leader at the quarter pole but had no late kick and tired. AWESOME
SUNSET failed to menace.
