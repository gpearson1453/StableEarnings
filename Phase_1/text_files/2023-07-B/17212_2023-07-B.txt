Footnotes
LOOKING FOR FLARE rated close inside, dueled to the front two deep at the quarter pole, raced clear midway on the far turn, was moderately handled
through the upper stretch then taken in hand later yards. WAVERLEY settled off the rail on the opening turn, rallied to the lead approaching the three
eighths pole, was caught at the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and had to settle for second best. SHADES OF BLUE saved ground
well off the early pace, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, improved at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SNOOZE BUTTON rounded the
first turn in the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but faded toward the far turn. GERMANY JAYVO rounded the first turn in
the five path and showed little response through the backstretch. MORE TAJ was not a factor. UNBRIDLED IRISH took the lead and moved to the inside to
show the way, but was caught approaching the three eighths pole and gave way readily.

DRINKWITHTHESTARS took a quick lead and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and held on under steady stretch handling. DOC ELM
gave chase and entered the turn off the rail, angled out approaching the head of the lane and finished well to close the gap. BARB'S PRIDE gave chase
through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path but was carried wider into the lane and came along to take third later yards. PRIMETIME JET
pressured the early pace but dropped back leaving the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the turn and flattened stride. UNCLE REMI pressured the
pace inside, dropped back approaching the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn and weakened. MOTIVATED SPEAKER raced wide and never
factored.

HAPPY CHAMP raced with the pace inside, dueled into the backstretch and had the edge at the rail into the far turn, drew off from the mid point of the turn,
was steadily handled through the upper stretch then coasted the final sixteenth. MAKE WAY raced well off the pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, steadily progressed at the rail on the far turn and held on for second. CHARLIE POTATOES settled in the two and three paths early on
and raced well off the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, improved his position then flattened later yards.
RIGHTEOUS MAN settled in the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path and showed little in the
lane. FIND YOUR BOAZ rounded the first turn about the five path, raced well back and could only improve his position. LIQUID LOUIE saved ground and
showed little response through the backstretch. LANTAU raced with the pace two deep, dueled leaving the half mile pole but dropped back midway on the
far turn and weakened. ENVISION SUCCESS was through after a half mile.

TIZ THE REASON set a pressured pace leaving the half mile pole, dueled clear into the turn and held well under steady handling. REIGN ON AND ON gave
chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and cleared second inside the sixteenth pole. DING DING pressured the pace past the half
mile pole but dropped back into the turn, flattened inside the eighth pole but held on for third. BACKSTREET AFFAIR chased through the backstretch, raced
at the rail on the turn, finished evenly and just missed third. MY JUBA gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the lane. TRUE
HEIRESS chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the five path and weakened in the stretch.

JUMPIN JACK BRASS ducked out leaving the gate then rated close off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the
far turn, angled out approaching the head of the lane, dug in for the lead in later yards and edged clear toward the wire. JUST HAVE FAITH raced well back
off the rail the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, steadily improved off the rail on the far turn and finished well to take second the final yards.
XTENDED STREAK was forced outward leaving the gate but moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement through the stretch but was caught flattening stride later yards.
SHEWEARSSTILETTOS stalked the early pace two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the five sixteenths, rounded the
far turn about the four path and flattened. CANDY LOVES HONEY exchanged contact with Lime Star leaving the gate and checked off the heels of
Shewearsstilettos into the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. JUBASLILBALLERINA was shut off
leaving the gate then settled inside, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole but dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter, raced at the rail on
the far turn and flattened stride. HARLAN'S VALENTINE rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but
showed little response. RUMORGOINGAROUND raced well off the pace about the four path and showed little response. LIME STAR exchanged contact
with Candy Loved Honey leaving the gate, raced in the five path the first turn, was never a factor and was eased. AFIRE saved ground well back on the first
turn, showed little response and was eventually eased.

MIDNIGHT ACT settled back off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the half mile pole and drew close in the three path on the far turn, dueled to the lead
past the eighth pole, briefly gave up the nod to UNCAPTURED STORM past the sixteenth pole but came back determinedly to recover the edge in the final
strides. The latter settled off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was blocked at the heels of rivals midway on the far turn, eased out into the lane
and dueled to a brief lead in late stretch, but ceded the nod in the final strides. MAXIMUM IMPACT settled back in the three path the first turn, picked up the
chase from the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third later yards. GOODLUCKCHUCK took the lead
midway on the opening turn and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the
rail, was met past the eighth pole and weakened. ACE NINE NINE stalked from the two and three paths, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. MR HOOVER saved ground. MISSIONSNINETYNINE rated close to the early pace inside then
faded through the backstretch.

turn and dueled through the stretch for second. FROG TOWN rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole but raced boxed at the rail on the far
turn, was also stymied through the upper stretch but eased out toward the sixteenth pole and came back to take the nod for third under the wire. ODIE
dueled for the early lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway on
the far turn, raced close through the upper stretch but flattened later yards. FEARNOUGHT saved ground, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths
pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out entering the stretch and finished well. PRINCE OF FENTON settled close two deep then challenged
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, dueled close in the three path on the far turn but flattened in the lane. STRONG HEART settled in the three path the first

Footnotes
CHURCH KEY veered in leaving the gate then hustled up for the lead and set a pressured pace, raced at the rail on the turn and was steadily handled in the
stretch. GREAT DEVOTION pressured the pace inside, raced at the rail on the turn but couldn't improve significantly in the lane. BESTLA was forced inward
then shuffled back at the break, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in down the lane and just lasted for third.
MOJO MATTERS chased outside, raced in the six and seven paths on the turn, left the turn widest and finished well. SISTER JOANN gave chase through
the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four path, drifted approaching the eighth pole and passed some rivals. WOODSONG'S CASTLE was forced in
leaving the gate and settled into stride, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened later yards.
MIDNIGHT PASS bobbled at the break, never factored and rounded the turn about the five path. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW gave early chase but faded past
the three eighths pole. I'M A TOTAL DIVA gave close chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path and weakened.
