Footnotes
CHEEKERS reluctant to load, shared the lead between rivals once the race began, was roused two wide at the quarter pole, carried out some entering the
lane, exchanged bumps with ARROW STRIKE several times midstretch and edged ahead in time. ARROW STRIKE vied for the lead from the beginning
from inside, drifted out some into the stretch, exchanged several bumps with CHEEKERS just inside the last eighth, fought gamely to the wire but had to
settle for second best. RIGHT ON RICHIE hustled to contest the pace on the first bend, did not keep up while staying outside CHEEKERS on the
backstretch, was in path three through the second turn and rallied belatedly deep stretch. KING DOODLE settled well off the inside, lost ground staying well
off the inside then showed some late interest outside rivals inside the final eighth.

Footnotes
MY KINDA TETON broke alertly and soon took the inside, was challenged from outside midway on the backstretch, drew clear again when allowed on the
bend, lengthened command under urging upper stretch then was ridden out under confident handling the final furlong. DRAGGING MAIN was taken inside
early on, picked up his pace after a quarter mile, angled outside MY KINDA TETON upper stretch, moved clear for second and closed the gap on the leader
in the late going. NOBLE CREEKER hustled along between rivals early, came into the lane from path four and drifted out some as he made up ground on
the top pair in the waning yards. SPAN broke well but settled to the back and well off the inside, was in path three on the bend, swung out between horses
entering the lane, passed inside tired ones upper stretch then leveled off. LELAND JOHN contested the early pace from outside, was carried out to path five
on the turn, forced out further into the stretch and had little to offer. RA'DOM displayed early speed between horses but drifted out through the bend and
entering the lane and quickly faded.

SEATTLESWAY bumped at the break, shared the lead outside MO WANNA GO, dropped back a bit on the bend, came again when asked in the lane and
slowly edged ahead the final sixteenth. MO WANNA GO made a large leap outward at the start, bumping SEATTLESWAY, disputed the pace from inside,
moved ahead on the turn, was challenged again in the stretch and slowly yielded inside the last sixteenth. VALIENTE CLAYMORE raced closest to the top
pair, closed the gap some while following SEATTLESWAY on the bend, fanned outside the latter into the lane, lugged in some under right-handed pressure
after entering the last furlong, was straightened, surged in the late going, came up short but was easily best of the rest. KNUCKLE broke slowly, stayed well
off the inside most of the way and showed little. HALF THE BATTLE broke alertly but soon retreated, was in path three on the turn, took the rail entering the
stretch and had little to offer.

DANZA TAXI was hustled up inside horses to gain the advantage near the half mile marker, moved clear on the bend, floated out some entering the stretch,
widened command as he lugged in under right-handed pressure approaching the eighth pole, was corrected, kept to task to inside the last sixteenth then
allowed to coast as much the best. DIAMND CON SUERTE advanced from path three on the turn, lost further ground, floating out to path six into the lane,
took over second with a sixteenth left then could only pull away for the place late. RUN THE TABLE broke alertly, drifted out some once on the main track,
was challenged from inside near the half mile pole, did not stay with DANZA TAXI on the bend, drifted out to path four into the stretch and began to wear
down inside the final furlong. ITS MAMBO in contention early, faded from inside on the turn, fanned out some for the drive, angled out further with a
sixteenth left and made up minor ground. TEMPLE FOOL hesitated at the break, chased from well off the inside, swung widest for the stretch run and also
showed some late interest. XPRESSIR broke outward, pressed the early pace under urging but began to fade from path three on the bend.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD MINISTRY bumped with U S HONOUR NAP at the break, angled to the inside soon after that, rushed up, brushing and leaning on LAGRUE
as he went for the lead nearing the end of the first eighth, drew clear of the rest after two furlongs, drifted out to path four leaving the turn and was under
urging in the lane until until inside the last sixteenth. TIZWOW advanced widest on the turn, angled in beside LAGRUE midway on the bend, took over
second nearing the quarter pole, floated out to path six into the stretch and could only hold his position late. PLAIN OR PEANUT was away slowly, trailed
not far off the inside, lost ground fanning to path eight into the lane and rallied belatedly. BRIANS WAY chased from outside, stayed off the rail on the turn,
lost considerable ground fanning to the middle of the track for the drive but showed a willingness to run late. I'M YOUR VALENTINE gradually angled in on
the backstretch, came off the rail nearing the quarter pole, lost ground swinging outside TIZWOW entering the lane and lacked a rally. U S HONOUR NAP
bumped with WILDWOOD MINISTRY at the start, raced in contention between horses early, was shuffled back on the bend, angled to the inside with a
quarter mile to go and steadily yielded. LAGRUE unruly in the gate, displayed early speed just off the inside, was crowded by WILDWOOD MINISTRY
nearing the end of the first eighth, did not stay with that one after two furlongs and began to fade just off the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
SNOOZER took a clear lead after the first furlong, was put to a drive in the lane and proved much the best. TIZ APPROVED thrashed about briefly when the
gate opened, came out a couple lengths behind the rest of the field with his rider out of his irons, was soon angled to the inside with the jockey regaining his
footing after travelling a furlong, took over second, fanned out to path four entering the stretch and could only maintain his position late. LONESOME
DREAM forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch, failed to stay close just off the inside on the bend, swung out to path five for the drive and gained
third late. ONE WAY HOME raced in contention between rivals early, did not stay with the top pair as he took over third along the rail on the turn and
gradually yielded in the stretch. KARAYEL was soon well back, angled out through the bend and only made up minor ground from path five deep stretch.
MAC PANDOWDY failed to menace in wide trip.

Footnotes
GREER CROSSING prominent from outside, took over three wide on the bend, was urged leaving the turn, began to drift out as she lengthened command
midstretch, was corrected and continued to open up in the late going. BUMPER GIRL prompted the early pace between horses, went for the lead two wide
into the turn, could not hold back GREER CROSSING nearing the end of a half mile, angled out and edged ahead for second upper stretch then could only
hold her position in the waning yards. MISS MIA hustled along early, progressed from inside on the bend, swung out to path four entering the lane, altered
outside BUMPER GIRL midstretch, gained third inside the last furlong and was closing in on the latter inside the final sixteenth. BUNNY SHINE took a clear
lead midway on the backstretch, was challenged from outside into the turn, no match for GREER CROSSING and flattened out the final eighth. UNEEKY
prominent early just outside BUNNY SHINE, began to yield after a quarter mile. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER four to six wide through the bend, had no late
bid. BLUE EVEN SCORE failed to menace in a ground-saving trip. HUQOOQ stayed well off the inside through the bend and into the lane and had little to
offer. BULU faded from between rivals early on, stayed in path four through the turn and was empty for the drive.
