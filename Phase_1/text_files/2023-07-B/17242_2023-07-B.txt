Footnotes
TIZZY JUSTICE saved ground while unhurried down the backstretch, moved up through the turn, cut the corner into the lane, was in a bit tight when
straightening, cleared near the sixteenth pole and was kept to the task to last. REDHOTJUSTICE was last away and trailed into the first turn, was unhurried
into the far turn, continued near the rail through the turn, angled sharply into the lane and into the four path, straightened and was closing in. THIZZLE set
the pace along the inside into the lane, was challenged by the winner near the eighth pole, bumped with that one near the sixteenth pole and gave ground
grudgingly. SHANGHAI EXPRESS stalked the pace from the two path through the far turn then weakened in the drive. BEYOND JUSTICE was in the two
path through the turns when never far back then lacked a closing response. MEAN ELENITA was bothered into the first turn, raced in the two path through
the far turn, came into the lane from the six path and never was a factor. NOW HERES THE PLAN chased the pace from the three path into the far turn,
was asked for more in mid-turn and tired through the lane. GOODY FOUR SHOES came out into the first turn bothering rival, trailed into the lane and was
outrun. SEQUEEKER was in the three path through the far turn when near the back, came into the lane from the six path and was never in it. TAMARAC
LADY raced three wide into the firs turn, raced in the four path through the far turn and was empty into the lane.

Footnotes
GRAND IN BAY was unhurried while in the three path down the backstretch, moved closer to the inside into the turn, gained momentum in late turn, angled
into the four path and closed with energy to quickly run past the dueling leaders inside the sixteenth pole. PRINCE SHIM vied for the lead throughout while
two wide, came into the lane on near even terms, was brushed by dueling challenger near the eighth pole then stayed on to save the place spot while not a
match for the winner. BASSCOAT unhurried while in the two path through the far turn, came into the lane from the four or five path and was gaining to the
end. JERICHO EXPRESS vied for the lead along the inside with another into the lane, brushed with challenger when stepping out then weakened and lost
the show spot at the wire. INDOCUMENTADO trailed for half while off the inside, moved through the four path in late turn, swung into the lane from the six
path and offered a mild gain. FORWHOMTHEBELLTOLL broke to the outside, raced in the three path while chasing the pace into the far turn, was asked for
more in mid-turn and tired. FOLLOW THE MONEY raced near the inside into the far turn, came off the rail through mid-turn and into the lane and was
empty. GO NUTS never a factor while coming into the lane from the four path. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON
FOR CHANGE OF ORDER.

UNBRIDLED DEVINE dueled outside of the leader and drew off in the stretch under mild urging. VALINE stalked the pace in the three path, but was not a
match. LUCKY LINDA W stalked the pace in the four path, moved seven wide in the stretch but had no bid. CAROLYN'S ANGEL was unrushed early in the
three path, then bid late between foes, then gained the fourth spot. QUEEN D vied inside, then faded in the stretch. EVIL MATTERS was off awkwardly,
then had no bid. SUTTON'S PASS saved ground to no avail. MAE BEE RIGHT faded early outside, then saved ground around the turn.

Footnotes
FIRESIDE KITTEN chased the pace along the inside into the far turn, bid in late turn while moving off the rail, came into the lane from the three path, caught
the leader nearing the sixteenth pole and drove past. KICK OUT THE JAMS trailed early while near the inside, gained momentum in late turn, cut the corner
into the lane and rallied with strong energy along the rail to be closing in late. POLKA POLENTA stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved two wide
into the far turn to challenge for the lead, dueled into the lane, cleared outside the eighth pole then was no match for the winner late. TELLER TO SING was
in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path, continued to float out to the six path and moved up to just gain the fourth
spot. WICKED INTENT raced near the rail while in mid-pack, continued near the rail through the turn and into the lane and lacked a closing bid. GET N
TIPSY chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid three wide through mid-turn and into the lane and weakened in the drive. PRESCIENCE
was in the two path through the turn when well back, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. PRETTY ASSETS was outrun while
saving ground. LONGLEGGEDLAVERNE raced in contention into the far turn when in the two path and was empty turning into the lane. ARDIS set the pace
along the inside through late turn then retreated through the lane.

and was just caught at the wire. CIELO AZUL settled off the early pace while off the rail, bid four wide through late turn and into the lane, had aim after
straightening in the lane and steadily gained to the end. FLOWERPECKER set the pace inside while under pressure, dueled for the top spot into the lane to
inside the eighth pole then yielded late. BONNIE BILL saved ground through the turn and into the lane, came off the inside approaching the sixteenth pole
and was gaining late. DOUBLE TUFF raced in the two path through the turn and into the lane then rallied from between rivals. AZZARO STEEL never a
menace while along the inside throughout. THEDEVILSALGORITHM never a factor while in the four path through the turn. CAP DE FUEGO pressed then
vied for the lead two wide through the turn and into the lane then faded from between.

Footnotes
ZOLO set the pace along the inside from the outset, continued on a short lead through late turn, was asked for more into the lane then drew away and was
geared down in the last thirty yards. ROTARY DIAL chased the pace along the inside into the far turn, was shuffled back a bit when others bid from the
outside, continued near the rail through the lane and was up for the place spot while not a threat to the winner. TURBO SIX O pressed the winner two wide
through the far turn, was under a drive into the lane, could not gain on the top one and lost the place spot late. JEOPARDY THEORY was never a threat
while in the two path throughout. KING SOCIAL never a factor while in the two path through the turns and into the lane. TOO BAD JUSTICE chased the
pace from the three path into the turn, bid three wide in mid-turn, came into the lane from the four path and was empty. DEUTERONOMYSTRONG never
made an impact while near the inside.
