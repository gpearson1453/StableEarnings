Footnotes
MISS CIRCULAR GAL Away best, showed the way along the two path, opened up some and under pressure got the job done. PALS ALLY Broke
sluggishly, gained inside on the turn, eased out and finished well. YES YOUR HONOR Unhurried early, saved ground on the turn and finished well.
CENTRAL CAPITAL Unhurried along the two path, angled out and made a late bid. DARE TO BE GREAT In hand along the three path, two path on the turn
and weakened. LUCKY LONG LEGS Five wide into the turn, three path around it, was not a factor. ALL ABOUT BELLA Tracked along the three path to the
lane and tired. WINE TRAIL Four wide on the turn and tired. SCARF Stumbled at the start, four wide on the turn and tired.
