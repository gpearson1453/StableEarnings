CHARMING WAY , a bit reluctant to load into the starting gate, lacked speed behind horses on the turn, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch,
swept to command near the eighth pole and drew off while kept under pressure. ABUELO PAPS , four wide around the turn, bid for the lead in upper stretch
and finished willingly. ZEN MASTER bobbled leaving the starting gate, chased the pace while in the three path between horses on the turn and faded in the
drive. HELLMAN lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. GRAND ESCAPE , rated back leaving the chute, saved
ground on the turn, was taken to the five path in upper stretch, raced on his left lead and failed to menace. B WEST , checked in tight quarters along the
inner rail inside the three quarters pole, raced forwardly in the two path on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. PHRA PHROM opened up on the turn,
raced near the inner rail on the turn and faltered. LUV YA BYE BYE , angled to the inner rail near the six furlongs pole, chased the pace and faltered.

Footnotes
ABIDALE took over at once and set the pace under a light hold and towards the rail, handled outside pressure leaving the far turn, moved back clear past
the three eighths, was guided three wide into the lane and widened without being asked. CALL ON CLARA prompted the pace outside the winner, applied a
bit more pressure around the turn, failed to keep pace soon into the stretch, remained on her left lead past the sixteenth pole but kept on willingly to the wire.
GENNIE HIGHWAY stalked three wide, was pushed nearing the lane, shifted out five wide for the drive, gave futile chase, drifted in through the final furlong
and gave way.

guided to about the three path in upper stretch, moved away under right handed asks past mid stretch then steadily widened while hand ridden the final

DISTANT FIRE stalked the pace outside horses, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch and drew out under brisk urging.
PRINS FIRE bumped with SPUNKY IRISHMAN leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, remained on his left lead and rallied mildly. TOAST TO
COAST lacked speed, saved ground on the turn, entered the stretch in the two path, moved to the inner rail in mid stretch and had a slight rally. STORMY
FIRE advanced in the two path to take a short lead leaving the turn, remained prominent to the eighth pole then faded. SPUNKY IRISHMAN , rank at the
break, bumped with PRINS FIRE soon after the start, swung to the six path in mid stretch and was no menace. AUSTIN FROM BOSTON chased the pace
inside horses on the turn, angled out at the head of the stretch and gave way. NOBLE RIVER sprinted clear and was taken to the inner rail about a furlong
after the break, remained along the rail setting the pace and gave through the stretch. SCAT DANZ , outrun, was eased.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE edged up and bid to the inside of MY BOY COLTON heading to the three quarter pole, gained a slim advantage in the two path
nearing the turn, sparred around the turn and into the lane, shook clear under right handed asking in mid stretch, kept on resolutely and turned back an
inside challenge from ON THE ENGINE to prove best. ON THE ENGINE advanced towards the rail in the opening quarter top prompt the pace, dropped
back off the leaders leaving the far turn, came under a ride past the three eighths, gathered momentum into the stretch, gained inside rivals past mid stretch,
continued gamely but was kept at bay. FOOD FOODIE , four wide early and well within striking distance, raced three deep stalking the embattled leaders
past the three eighths, circled four wide into the stretch, churned on and slowly gained. MY BOY COLTON took over soon after the start while three wide,
was joined from his inside by the winner after a quarter mile, sparred into and around the turn, kept up the fight past the three sixteenths then faded very
late. BODE LYNX settled off the pace, swung five to six wide for the drive, wandered out heading towards mid stretch then flattened out. NEVERFOLD
broke a step slow, moved up off the rail nearing the five eighths, chased between rivals around the turn then weakened through the drive.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY REIGN tracked the leader two wide, moved to attack nearing the quarter pole, wrested command into the lane, cleared, drifted in near mid
stretch then held sway under a drive. GINGER GIRL , bumped at the break, chased while towards the inside, angled three wide approaching the stretch,
straightened and ranged up in mid stretch, kept on and steadily gained. COOKIE BANK , bumped leaving the gate, raced three wide mid turn, shifted out a
bit wider in the drive and continued with interest. CANDY COOP broke slowly, raced well back while saving ground mid turn, swung out to be about five
wide in upper stretch and had belated action. I'M PRETTY lagged back, swung six wide for the drive and failed to menace. ALWAYS FORWARD , bumped
at the break, saved ground under coaxing mid turn and weakened. LADY ENSIGN , bumped leaving the gate, sped clear soon after, set the pace towards
the rail, was taken on after a half mile, stayed on to about the three sixteenths then faltered.
