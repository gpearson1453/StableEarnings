Footnotes
RIVERSPORT sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, responded
when called upon and finished clear. PANZER PRIDE raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the backstretch, was ridden along three wide
around the far turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and outdueled rival for place. PIZZA CHARLIE was forwardly placed around the first turn and
stalked the pace setter up the backstretch, edged closer two wide around the far turn, could not catch the eventual winner but fought on and got edged for
place. MEET GEORGE JETSON rated not too far off the pace in early stages, continued two wide in range around the far turn then gave way. BRAHMS JR.
tracked the pace along the inside, was ridden along the rail around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. DODGER BLUE raced four wide into the
first turn and rated not far off the early pace, was ridden along to pick up the tempo late on the backstretch but had no response and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
MARINA'S GOLD raced two to three wide into the first turn and settled nicely in stalking position, picked up the pace midway around the far turn, launched a
bid for the leader approaching the quarter pole, ran on three wide into the lane, raced in striking distance, dug in determinedly under firm handling and drew
clear in the final sixteenth. MIDNIGHTCANDYSTORM was allowed to settle out of the gate and raced four wide around the first turn, continued well off the
pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo four wide late on the far turn, hustled along the outside into the lane, responded under pressure and gained
second best. DO YOU BILEVE sped to the lead at the start and led the way around the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch then held clear
around the far turn, battled back under pressure from eventual winner mid-stretch, could not hold off rival approaching the sixteenth pole, weakened and lost
place. STONECOLD STUNNER was unhurried and raced in or near the back through early stages, hustled up three to four wide around the far turn and
lacked a needed rally in the lane. SUGAR BELL pressed the pace up the backstretch, chased up close around the far turn, continued in contention to the
eighth pole then retreated. SUPER EMPIRE came up empty after a half and steadily retreated.

gamely but could not match strides in deep stretch. GRACIE'S BOY ROY raced off the top embattled flight in early stages, swung four to five wide into the
lane and cleared the rest. KING OF THE PALACE was not too far back off the the embattled top flight, was forced to shift out wide to avoid fallen foe
mid-way around the turn, swung wide into the drive and improved position. BORDINOS dueled three wide for the early lead, battled on into the turn, could
not match strides nearing the quarter pole and tired in the drive. DON JUAN BUBBA dueled along the inside in early stages, battled on around the turn, ran
on to the eighth pole then came up empty. ADAIR COUNTY raced off the pace, swung five wide into the lane and never threatened. RYAN'S WIND failed to
move into close contention. MR. BENNY chased along the inside and failed to threaten. BELL DOZER vied between rivals for the early lead, weakened from
the top flight then clipped heels mid-way around the turn, lost the rider and walked off. THE STEWARDS POSTED AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT BELL

and finished ridden out. DISCREET INVASION raced off the early pace, swung six wide into the lane and captured place. TIN BADGE stalked the top pair
up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and got caught for place in final strides. NASTY
EXAGGERATOR was unhurried, saved ground around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and improved position. WAR RON raced just off midpack in
early stages, hustled along two wide into the lane then shifted to the inside and needed more for late impact. GONE WITH THE FINN set a pressured pace
up the backstretch, shook free around the turn, held clear in upper stretch, got collared leaving the eighth pole and retreated. SAY IT NICELY pressed the
pace through early stages, chased in contention around the turn then faded in the lane. COBYMEISTER raced off the pace two to three wide and failed to
threaten.

REDNECKERTHANYOU sped to the lead at the start and set the early pace, turned back bids around the turn, saved ground into the lane, widened
advantage along the inside and kept to task under steady urging. ANNUAL BUDGET stalked the pace in early stages, hustled up three wide around the
turn, sustained bid through the lane and finished second best. SUCCESSION was off a bit slow at the start, remained unhurried off the pace, swung four to
five wide into the lane and finished with good response. LEADING THE CAUSE was allowed to settle in opening stages then edged up a bit closer after the
opening quarter, launched a rail bid around the turn, raced in contention into upper stretch then gave way. ON A DARE lacked speed and raced in the back,
came two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. HE'S A SHOWBOAT was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, continued to chase after
eventual winner around the turn then tired in the drive.
