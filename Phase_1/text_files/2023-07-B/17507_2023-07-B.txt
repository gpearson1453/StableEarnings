Footnotes
COURAGEOUSLY settled off of the pace three wide, launched a rally in the four path turning for home to offer a bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage
at the furlong grounds, inched clear in the final sixteenth and held from an outer on-coming rival. CURRENT showed the way along the inside into the first
turn, but pulled keenly while being headed by an outer rival around that bend, backed off and shifted out to settle entering the backstretch, pursued two wide
into the far turn, but yielded in the three path and between horses with five sixteenths to go, yet shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, re-found stride to
rally outside of rivals in the final furlong, then sustained a bid to range up to the leader in the late stages but was fended off. MINE OWN STAR saved
ground off of the pace, improved to a tracking position entering the far turn, attempted a rail bid inside of the leaders in midstretch, but only managed to
chase thereafter. MALIBU TIME prompted the pace three to two wide around the first turn before tugging clear entering the backstretch, showed the way a
bit off of the inside around the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder while an inner rival presented a challenge at the furlong grounds and gave way
between horses. ATTORNEY TIM trailed in the two to four path around the first turn, lacked a response to coaxing down the backstretch, tucked behind foes
around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to aim between rivals, but steadied when losing his path between rivals at the furlong grounds and failed to
recover. PRINCESS NINA tracked in the two path, took aim outside of the leader and moved to press around the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid and
yielded between horses in upper stretch before shifted out at the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
EDISTRUDIS was rowdy in the post parade, chased the leading trio while under urging in the four into the turn, crept closer turning for home, ranged up to
offer a bid nearing midstretch, struck the front leaving the furlong grounds and drove clear. KRICKLE prompted the pace setter from the three path, vied
around the turn before gaining an advantage approaching the quarter pole, showed the way from bidders on either side entering midstretch, but was
outkicked by an outer rival in the final furlong and fended off an inner foe for place. SARAH'S DREAM tracked along the inside, surpassed a tiring inner rival
entering the lane before hoping to attempt a bid inside of the leaders at the furlong grounds, but lacked the needed punch. BACK ON TRACK broke a step
slow at the start, lagged well behind the rest into the turn, yet picked up stride in the four path in upper stretch and rallied willingly with late interest. SILVER
MAJESTY lacked speed in the five path into the turn, tucked down to the three path turning for home and failed to factor. VEECATION set the pace inside of
a pressing rival while remaining a path off of the inner rail, relinquished an advantage to that one approaching the quarter pole and folded through the lane.

Footnotes
GUCCI BOY broke outwardly, vied three wide into the turn, inched clear approaching the quarter pole, was put to a drive entering the lane as an outer
INEXORABLE threatened, shifted out under right-rein rousing passing the furlong grounds to come out and embrace that foe's challenge, but bumped and
bothered him at the sixteenth pole, then exchanged contact again in the closing stages before holding firm. INEXORABLE settled off of the pace in the three
path, improved between horses at the three furlong pole to gain a tracking position in pursuit of the leading trio, progressed in the four path nearing the lane
as GUCCI BOY took charge, took aim outside of that one in upper stretch, inched closer to attempt a bid leaving the furlong grounds, but took meaningful
contact from the leader at the sixteenth pole stalling his momentum, then shared blame in exchanging a brush in the late stages before being turned away.
FOREVER COOL was subtly floated out by an inner foe at the start, raced towards the rear in the five path into the turn, tucked to the two path while
improving position passing the three furlong pole, moved out to the three path turning for home before shifting to the five path in upper stretch, then gained
show at the furlong grounds and ran on. NIGHT CHANT vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but gave way approaching the quarter pole.
HEZMORETHANREADY tracked the leading trio into the turn, but faded under urging in the four path and outside of foes around the bend. BLUES
ADMIRAL leaned out at the start, sparred for the lead two wide and between a pair of rivals, but weakened turning for home. MAGICAL THINKING lacked
speed in the two path and was done early. THE RIDER OF INEXORABLE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF GUCCI BOY FOR INTERFERENCE
IN THE FINAL FURLONG; FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, GUCCI BOY WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED

Footnotes
LARK'S MISCHIEF set the pace in the two path, showed the way from a pair of outer pressers around the turn, resisted MULLIKIN's challenge while turning
for home in the three path, swiftly repelled that bid in upper stretch and held sway through the final furlong. ZAMBEZI tracked from off of the pace in the four
path while among rivals, advanced along with an outer foe to press the pace setter at the three furlong pole, chased while tucking to the three path soon
after, but failed to keep pace with the leader while shifting outside of his outer counterpart in upper stretch and ran on willingly to secure place. STUD LOVIN
saved ground off of the pace, then stayed on with a steady rail charge to gain show late. MULLIKIN dropped his head just before the gate sprung causing
him to miss the break by over a length, gained in the five path and outside of rivals approaching the turn, sustained progress to bid in the four path at the
five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. QUICK HAMMER chased outside
of the leader, but was outmoved by outer rivals with three furlongs to go and gave way.

Footnotes
DARKROOM broke a step slow while leaning in a touch, exchanged light contact with an outer rival early on, settled off of the pace in the two path while
behind rivals, checked while encountering traffic while entering the lane in the five path, yet rallied between horses in midstretch, ranged up to the leader
leaving the sixteenth pole and edged an advantage. IN A JAM vied two wide, led around the turn, repelled an outer bidder entering the lane, but subtly
drifted out through midstretch, was caught by outer bidders in the final sixteenth yet saved place at the wire. COIN MINER brushed with rivals on both sides
early on, settled off of the pace in the three path, fanned to the six path entering the lane and rallied outside of the eventual winner thereafter but narrowly
missed reaching place. COACH JIMI D brushed an inner rival early on, pursued from midpack along the inside, inched closer two wide turning for home,
grazed an outer rival while shifting to the four path straightening for home, but was herded inwardly by that rival in the final furlong and flattened out. LIAM'S
JOURNEY pursued from midpack two wide, crept closer in the four path turning for home, took light contact from an inner rival while being brushed to the
five path in upper stretch, then lacked the needed punch and was outkicked by outer rivals in the final furlong while drifting inwardly. YULETIDE GALLOP
bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced close up behind the leaders while in the two to three path into the turn, ranged up to bid at the quarter pole, but
was turned away entering the lane, took a brush from an outer rival at the furlong grounds and weakened. MCVICKER exchanged contact with an outer rival
at the start, vied along the inside, but gave way turning for home and faltered. RED FROST snagged the inner part of the gate while breaking multiple
lengths behind the rest, lagged behind around the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
DUPLICITOUS broke outwardly, vied five wide into the turn, sparred outside of FOREVER HOME while tucking two wide turning for home, gained an
advantage from that one in upper stretch and edged clear with a sixteenth to go. FOREVER HOME vied four wide and between horses, dueled with an outer
rival turning while tucking to the rail nearing the quarter pole after inner rivals faltered, fought on while getting headed in upper stretch, but failed to keep
pace entering the final sixteenth and was second best. L. A. STAR trailed in the three path, gained in the four path and between horses turning for home,
then sustained progress among foes to gain place at the sixteenth pole. JUDY'S WAY was hung in the five path while off of the pace and stayed on mildly
while one paced. HOLDONTOYOURTIARA vied for the lead inside of a quartet of rivals into the turn, failed to sustain pressure at the three furlong pole, yet
kept on while chasing entering the lane, vied with outer rivals for show through midstretch but was outkicked at the sixteenth pole. HIGH SPEED tracked in
the three to four path, pursued from striking range turning for home, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before tiring between horses in the final
furlong. U SO MONEY BABY lacked speed in the four path, tucked while trailing around the turn and failed to factor. MABEE LUCKYNWILD vied three wide
and between horses but faded at the five sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter. SHAPE OF YOU vied two wide and between horses but weakened
entering the turn.

Footnotes
SPONGE BATH dueled for the lead two wide, sparred in the four path in upper stretch, led crossing the furlong pole and drove clear. DO YOUR JOB
stalked along the inside, shifted to the five path to be outside of the top pair in upper stretch, but only managed to chase, sustained stride in the final furlong
and gained place in the late stages. AUGUSTINE RED took mild contact from an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, looked to
vacate the rail turning for home, yet decided on cutting the corner entering the lane, sustained grinding progress before looking again to shift out in the final
furlong, but decided to maintain a rail charge in the final sixteenth and gained show in the shadow of the wire. SUGA STEVE leaned in and brushed a foe at
the start, dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, spun into the lane in the three path, got headed in midstretch, faltered between horses in the
closing stages and dead-heated for fourth. THUNDER BALL saved ground off of the pace, shifted off the fence in midstretch and stayed on willingly to reach
a dead heat for fourth. KITTY HAWK was excused from the post parade, yet dropped his rider entering the clubhouse turn while warming up, jogged before
being caught by an outer rider down the backstretch, was reunited with his rider without further incident, then hopped and bumped the inner half of the gate
while breaking slow at the start, recovered to stalk from the three path, but floated to the five path in upper stretch and caved in hand through the final
furlong. QUIET RUSH pursued from midpack two wide and failed to factor. SHARPENYOURFAITH broke slowly, lacked speed along the inside and never
got involved. KING BUKELE lacked speed three wide, then lugged inwardly in upper stretch and faded. TANGO YANKEE broke outwardly while off slow,
then veered in sharply in the opening furlong, lagged well behind the rest around the turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PENSACOLA vied three wide, led into the turn, drew clear at the three furlong pole, held sway through midstretch, shifted out subtly in the final furlong and
lasted safely as a pair of outer rivals closed in late. STRAIGHT AND LEVEL leaned inwardly at the start, pursued from midpack two wide and between
horses, emerged among foes to track from the three path around the turn, took aim on the leader from the four path in upper stretch, but drifted outwardly
while chasing inside of foe entering the final furlong, then steadily closed in late but needed more. RIVALRY lacked early foot outside of rivals, avoided a
troubled foe into the turn by altering course outwardly, gathered while hung in the five path around the bend, yet gained turning for home, sustained
progress to bid for place outside of STRAIGHT AND LEVEL nearing midstretch, but was herded outwardly by that foe through the final furlong and missed
reaching that one late. SHOWDOWN KING vied two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart with three furlongs to go,
chased along the inside turning for home and gave way. GUADALAJARA lacked speed in the two path, improved between horses in the three path in upper
stretch and stayed on. GILDED CRAKEN broke in a tangle while last away, lacked speed along the inside, surpassed inner tiring rivals around the turn, but
failed to reach contention. ALILNALOT tracked in the four path but faded turning for home. GREAT BARRIER trailed in the four path and made little impact.
DISSOLVED vied along the inside but weakened entering the turn. NORBERT tracked along the inside but faded approaching the turn. HOLY MOLY
ABRAHAM prompted the pace four wide, but lost his rider after suffering an injury entering the turn and was vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REVIEWING THE RUNNER-UP'S ACTIONS THROUGH THE STRETCH, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
JOHNY'S FIREBALL set the pace in the two path and held sway through the lane. MAHAAMEL tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the leader
entering the lane but only managed to chase that one home and held place. POLICY OPTION rated at the rear two wide, took the far turn in the five path,
fanned to the six path entering the lane and ran on to narrowly reach show at the wire. STOLEN BASE saved ground in midpack, chased while vying for
show through the lane, but was nailed at the wire for that position. DHABAB (IRE) settled in the three to four path, then stayed on between horses. CALL
ME MIDNIGHT pursued from midpack two wide, moved out four wide entering the backstretch, tracked while inching closer to within striking range around
the far turn, but failed to sustain a bid and yielded between horses in the late stages. MR. BIG NEWS tracked two wide and between horses, moved to press
the leader from the three path around the far turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane. ALEJANDRO saved ground towards the rear, but to no
avail. TAPAGE stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, but weakened between horses entering the far turn.
