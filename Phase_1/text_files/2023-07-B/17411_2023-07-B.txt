two path through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and edged up for the place late. RAINAS ROLLIN well placed, moved up on the
two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch, drifted out and was outfinished for the place. MADE TO HUSTLE set the pace off the rail, stayed

Footnotes
DEACON DOUGIE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then drew off in the stretch and was kept to the task. UNCLE
JOCK tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then could not threaten the winner, while clearly best
of the rest. SPENDOLINI mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside and edged up for the show late. SHY DA RUNNER
hopped at the start, was well placed and off the rail, gained position three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. WILLIE
WANDO allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and improved position. GOOSE HUNTER
unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed tiring rivals. TURNS was never involved. PURE SPRING
stalked the pace outside and faded on the two path through the turn.
