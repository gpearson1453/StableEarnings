Footnotes
MANI PEDI tracked the early pace along the inside, continued its inside bid into the upper stretch, finished well in the lane while angling out deep stretch
and was clear late under strong pressure. WICKED T showed good early speed to set the early pace, veered out sharply just past the eighth pole, forced
Londonderry to take up, a stewards inquiry an jockey objection was filed by Londonderry and stewards disqualified Wicked T and placed third for
interference in the stretch run. LONDONDERRY was off a step slow, settled off the early going, moved up from the outside in the lane, forced to take up
past the eighth pole, shifted in and kept on gamely to the wire. ARCTICA prompt two wide down the backstretch and weakened in the drive. JUSTIN TIME
stalked the pace from the outside of foes and faded. MISS MORENO was void of early speed and trailed.

along the inside down the backstretch, raced near the rail in the stretch and rallied for the place position. HIDDEN SPRINGS tracked two deep from the
outside of rival and kept on willingly to the wire. LADY BREXIT stalked the pace three deep outside of foes, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and

DANCE A LITTLE JIG dropped back mid pack early on, raced from the outside in the lane and lacked a bid. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL was unhurried early
and failed to respond. HIT A HOMER HONEY raced five wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.

SHUTUP AND HANG ON stalked the pace along the inside, continued its inside bid into the stretch, angled to the outside of rivals near the eighth pole and
edged up late under strong handling. CHELICHNA stalked the pace from the outside of foes, moved up three wide near the quarter pole to challenge, led
deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. AFRICAN ANGEL settled off the early pace, moved up four to five wide in the stretch and finished willingly to
the wire. IMNOTONETOCOMPLAIN showed good early speed to set the early pace, had a narrow lead near the eighth pole and faltered in the final stages.
SAYYIDA AL HURRA raced near the back of the pack early, checked along the inside near the three eighths pole and never threatened. DALLAS was slow
early on and never threatened. HOLD ME CLOSER tracked two deep and tired readily.

wide between rivals and gained ground well late. DATE NIGHT KISSES showed good early foot to set the early pace and weakened in the drive.
MOONSAFE raced mid pack early on, was along the outside of foes in the stretch and had no late rally. QUEEN'S DREAM dropped back early and failed to
