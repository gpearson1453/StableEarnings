EXAMINER stalked the pace from a rail position, roused nearing the quarter pole, took over entering the stretch, and held. ADRIEN'S AURORA shifted from
the rail out to the four path leaving the backstretch, lodged a bid at the quarter pole, rallied into the stretch but was unable to get by the eventual winner.
CARSON'S LEGACY set the pace from the three path, moved clear in the far turn, was overtaken at the head of the lane, weakened then was able to hold
off DREADNAUGHT for show. DREADNAUGHT lacked the early speed needed and was unable to improve position late. MANFORALLSEASONS sat in
range while four to five wide, and failed to threaten.

SKIP'S ROCK broke sharply then quickly took command, drew away in the far turn, remained unchallenged into the stretch, kept to task, and held. SOFIA D
'AMORE shifted out to the four path entering the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the quarter pole, and was gaining ground late on the
leader. ROSE ROSE ROSE settled inside from just off the rail, chased through the stretch but lacked the kick needed. NO MORE JO KING raced wide after
leaving the chute, chased outside through the backstretch, and faded. I SAID QUIET lagged early, and was outrun.

THESHACK broke alertly then emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, set the early pace under a snug hold from the three path, turned back a
challenge from BACKSTREET BOBBY then was given his cue at the quarter pole, and was kept to task under intermittent reminders. EL NOBLE
outsprinted in the turn, stalked four wide, was shuffled back leaving the backstretch, chased the leader into the stretch, and finished willingly to prove
second best. BACKSTREET BOBBY raced three wide in the opening turn, moved up alongside THESHACK leaving the backstretch, was brushed, and
lacked a closing response. GRIGORO settled at the back of the pack, fanned four-wide leaving the backstretch, and tired early. SMART PLAY was under a
strong hold leaving the opening turn, sat wide through the backstretch, and was eased.

Footnotes
COUNTESS CAT sent for speed then angled quickly to the two path, led the field through the turn, responded to a threat from PONY GIRL near the quarter
pole, and kicked away through the stretch under brisk confident handling. VIVIEN'S CHARM sat in striking range inside, responded to handling approaching
the stretch, and rallied late to earn place honors. PONY GIRL sat in range while four wide, moved up menacingly near the quarter pole, and lacked the rally
needed in the drive. FOREVER LADY fanned four wide in the opening turn, and rallied belatedly. SAYGE'S SPIRIT vied early, was shuffled back into the
opening turn, was under heavy encouragement into the stretch, and gave way late. WAVESINTHEOCEAN chased five wide and was outrun.

Footnotes
SINGING BELL nestled inside behind the pacesetter, shifted outside approaching the five-sixteenth pole, gained the lead, and held firmly while under
pressure from MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER through the stretch. MISCHIEVOUSOFFICER quickly went to the front to lead the field through the backstretch,
was overtaken before the quarter pole, was kept under urging but was unable to muster the bid needed in the stretch. JOY IN GRACE chased wide through
the backstretch, fanned four wide in the far turn, and rallied belatedly for show. HENRY'S GAMBLE settled four to five wide early, and came up empty in the
drive. SUDDENLY MISTY unhurried early, hustled five wide on the final turn but was unable to improve position in the stretch. GRACEFUL SPIRIT chased
four wide early, and left nothing in reserve for the drive.

Footnotes
LITTLE CHICAGO sat in striking position from the five path, fanned three wide entering the far turn, set sights on INDEPENDENCE NEIGH at the head of
the lane, angled down to the rail then gained a slim lead in the final sixteenth and edged clear. INDEPENDENCE NEIGH zipped to the front, set a pressured
pace from the three path, drew clear in the far turn, and was worn down late. SNAP COUNT stalked from the two path, uncoiled a bid after the quarter pole
earning show. PULL THE PIN sat between foes in the four path, chased inside through stretch and was out finished for show. FULL VELOCITY saved
inside early, shifted outside into the final turn, and bid belatedly. DANZA UNBRIDLED sat in range while wide through the backstretch, and flattened out.
HIGH FLYIN TIGER never reached contention.
