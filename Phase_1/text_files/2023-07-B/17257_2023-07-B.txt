Footnotes
PUNCTUALITY tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, bid leaving the three furlong pole, assumed command turning for home and drew off
under moderate urging. SECRET EDGE settled off of the pace in the three path, then ran on to gain place inside the final sixteenth. CAMP GRAY prompted
the pace setter from the three path, inherited an advantage from that one at the three furlong pole as an outer rival loomed a danger, proved no match for
that one soon after, then weakened through the lane while hanging on his left lead and lost place in the final sixteenth. LEFT POCKET MONEY saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BEAU DAY set the pace while crossing over to the two path leaving the first bend, showed the way down the
backstretch, but was overtaken by a pair of rivals at the three furlong pole and readily stopped. ALPHA LEA got tangled up in the gate before leaving many
lengths behind the rest of the field and lagged well behind throughout. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START, ALPHA LEA WAS
FOUND TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN A FAIR START; THEREFORE NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
INTREPID HEART tracked in the two path, shifted out to the four path entering the backstretch, ranged up to bid outside of the leading pair at the five
sixteenths pole, led turning for home before inching clear in upper stretch and fended off an outer challenger in the closing stages. W W CRAZY stalked
along the inside, chased under urging turning for home, shifted out to the three path entering the lane, stayed on in pursuit of the clear leader in midstretch,
narrowed the gap to attempt a bid in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay late. DIXIE DRAWL was put to a bit of crowded quarters as an outer rival cut
down around the first turn, settled at the rear in the three path, then improved between horses in the final sixteenth. NEPOTISM was also put to tight
quarters among foes in the opening stages, shifted out and gained in the four path in the latter half of the first turn to prompt the leader entering the
backstretch, vied in the two path approaching the far turn, but was outmoved by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole, yielded at the quarter pole and
steadily gave way. SPRINKLEHEAD rushed forward while shifting in to set the pace in the two path entering the backstretch, showed the way from a pair of
outer rivals into the far turn, got headed by the eventual winner at the quarter pole and weakened on his left lead through the lane.

Footnotes
SHE FEELS PRETTY broke a step slow and settled off of the pace two wide and between horses, inched closer in the three path turning for home before
fanning five wide in upper stretch, offered a rally in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong and reeled in that one in the closing stages. MYA'S HALO
set the pace inside of a prompting foe while a path off of the inside around the turn, kicked away from that one in upper stretch, but was worn down by an
outer oncharging bidder in the shadow of the wire. WONDER WAVE (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside and sustained a rail grind to gain show in
the final furlong. FANCY LOOKER chased in the three to four path around the turn, failed to keep pace with the leader while bidding for minor placings in
upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival for place in midstretch, then an inner foe for show in the final furlong. MAGHRA (IRE) chased from
midpack in the two path, shifted out a touch in midstretch and moved up late. TWO HEARTED tracked behind the leaders while in the two path but yielded
between horses in the final furlong. WINSOME BEAUTY prompted the leader from the three path, failed to keep pace with that one leaving the three
sixteenths pole and weakened between horses passing the furlong grounds. STAR PERFORMANCE failed to menace from the two path. LADY OF DEVON
broke slowly, lacked speed inside of rivals, turned for home in the two path and failed to factor. DON'T BRING CRAZY broke a step slow, trailed in the three
path into the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and made little impact. MASHKA lacked speed in the four path, faded turning for home and was eased up
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
COEXIST tracked four wide, ranged up turning for home to bid outside of the new leader at the quarter pole, wrestled an advantage entering the lane and
drove clear leaving the furlong grounds. CHARLEY RUDE pressed three wide, bid and gained an advantage at the five sixteenths pole before resisting
COEXIST's outer challenge at the quarter pole, got headed by that one at the three sixteenths pole, failed to keep pace in the final furlong and was second
best. HAMMERDONHAPPINESS got restless awaiting the start, raced at the rear in the three path, then split foes at the furlong grounds to gain show soon
after. FAST GAL laid off of the pace in the two three path around the turn, fanned to the five path entering the lane and ran on mildly. TAMARA'S WAY
prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but was outmoved by an outer pair at the five sixteenths pole and gave way. COLORATURA set the pace
along the inside, but was headed while inside of a trio of foes at the five sixteenths pole and weakened through the lane. HALO OF FIRE was outrun along
the inside.

ANGLOPHILE pursued from midpack two wide, lost position while in a bit tight among foes into the far turn, responded to coaxing turning for home to regain
stride, fanned to the six path in upper stretch to take aim outside of rivals, but was herded outwardly by the leader while ranging up leaving the furlong
grounds, offered a bid while taking light contact at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead late. MOUNT RUNDLE settled off of the pace while hung three wide
around the first turn, tracked around the far turn before taking aim on the leaders from the four path nearing the lane, bid in upper stretch, forged a narrow
advantage at the furlong grounds before drifted out to deter an outer pursuing ANGLOPHILE leaving that juncture, brushed that bidding foe at the sixteenth
pole and got bested. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD stalked along the inside, awaited racing room behind the leaders at the quarter pole, got through as a pair of
outer rivals kicked past leaving the furlong grounds, and sustained a chase to gain show at the sixteenth pole. KING CURLIN got a bit antsy in the starting
gate requiring him to be backed out for a vet exam, reloaded once cleared to go, stalked two wide, bid in the three path around the far turn, vied turning for
home and through upper stretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds and gave way. CARNIVORE set the pace, met an outer
challenge while taking the far turn in the two path, got headed by outer rivals nearing the furlong grounds and weakened between horses a sixteenth from
home. JARREAU saved ground off of the pace, briefly awaited racing room into the far turn, but failed to respond to urging turning for home. SMOKEY LEE
trailed in the two to four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
DARING DO leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, tracked along the inside, claimed place while smoothly tipping outside of the leader in upper stretch,
bid leaving the furlong grounds, drove past approaching the final sixteenth and held sway from an inner pursuer thereafter. TWICE AS SWEET laid off of the
pace along the inside while a bit off of the inner railing, then sustained a rail grind while aiming inside of the top pair, gained place at the sixteenth pole but
was kept at bay by the leader through the late stages. AMERICAN APPLE set the pace along the inside, inched a clear margin into the turn, shifted off the
rail entering the lane, got confronted by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, was headed by that one soon after, lost place to an inner foe at the sixteenth
pole and yielded, yet saved show. ERNA took light contact from an inner foe at the start, raced at the rear in the five path, and stayed on through the lane
but ran out of ground to reach show. CONDENSATION chased briefly, faltered two wide and between horses around the turn, cut the corner while towards
the rear entering the lane and moved up inside of foes in midstretch. TWIRLED pressed two wide and between horses, chased around the turn and
weakened in upper stretch. MORNIN' BOSS pursued three wide, turned for home between horses and failed to factor. FOOLISH brushed an outer rival
before being bumped by an inner foe at the start, then made little impact from the four path. ZOOM ERIN stalked three wide but weakened between horses
entering the lane.

Footnotes
DAI VERNON brushed with an inner rival while off a step slow, lagged well behind along with another foe early on, gained outside of rivals approaching the
far turn, produced a sweeping move in the seven path around the far turn, took aim on the clear leader from the four path entering the lane, bid at the
furlong grounds and kicked clear. SMILE MON pressed three wide, drew clear passing the five sixteenths pole, but offered little resistance to an outer
challenge at the furlong grounds and fended off an inner rival for place. SINGLE DOT YAHT pursued from midpack along the inside, got shuffled back
behind a tiring rival around the far turn, slipped inside of that one at the quarter pole and rallied between horses while knifing through rivals in the final
furlong, but was staved off by an outer foe for place late. FEAR OF UNION settled off of the pace in the three path, tracked in the four path around the far
turn and ran on evenly. TEXAS PRIDE brushed with an outer rival before being slow into stride at the start, raced far back, improved in the five path at the
three furlong pole, but leveled off through the lane. SMOKE WAGON raced forwardly four wide, chased the leaders around the far turn, but yielded between
horses in the final furlong. BOONE'S PATH set the pace outside of a prompting foe, showed the way in the two path into the far turn, but was headed at the
five sixteenths pole and weakened. SPEED INSTITUTE broke outwardly, pursued five wide, weakened around the far turn and surpassed tiring rivals in the
final furlong. CUSP prompted the pace along the inside, but failed to sustain position at the five furlong pole, chased into the far turn, but faded around that
bend. HOLY MOLY ABRAHAM got rank and pulled in the two to four path behind the main group entering the backstretch, tugged between horses soon
after, but weakened with three furlongs to go. TOWN BARBER took mild contact from rivals on both sides at the start, then was outrun in the two path.
DENIER tracked two wide and between horses, but weakened around the far turn before being eased through the final furlong.

L J'S EMMA pursued from midpack in the two path, rallied to take aim inside leader in the final furlong, bid as that one drifted out at the sixteenth pole and
edged an advantage. HIDEKI broke a bit inwardly, raced off of the pace in the four path, picked up stride in the five path entering the lane, rallied outside of
foes in the final furlong, got herded outwardly by the drifting leader at the sixteenth pole, then just caught that one at the wire to narrowly prevail for place.
EMPIRE OF MY OWN set the pace in the four path, tucked to the two path while drawing clear entering the turn, spun into the lane in the three path, but
lugged outwardly approaching the final sixteenth as an inner rival offered a bid, got bested by that one then nailed by an outer rival for place. DEVINE
CHARGER pursued from off of the pace in the three path and between horses, then ran on willingly. RUTHLESS RUA stalked in the two path, chased
entering the lane and yielded between horses. ALWAYS AT EASE broke a beat slow, was void of speed in the two path and moved up between horses in
the late stages. CHARRIERE broke half a beat slow, pursued from midpack in the three to four path, bumped with an inner rival entering the lane, but lacked
a bid thereafter. FOUR DAWN raced forwardly along the inside, but steadied in tight rail quarters at the nine sixteenths pole, chased from off of the pace
around the bend, but made little impact. ONLY KIDDING laid off of the pace in the two path and failed to factor. UP TO SOMETHING broke a step slow and
got outrun. SHANNON tracked in the three path, but bumped with an outer rival while weakening entering the lane.
