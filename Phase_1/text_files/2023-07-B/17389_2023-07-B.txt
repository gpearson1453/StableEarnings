from the rail, opened a clear advantage through the final turn, and widened her margin late to prove best. HARLAN'S ANGEL away well and pressed the
pacesetter three wide entering the backside, struggled to keep tabs on the leader while racing three wide into the final turn, and closed willingly two wide in

final turn, and finished willingly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and tracked the leaders in the run down the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn but failed to mount a serious late bid while finishing four wide in the

QUAGMIRE away alertly and raced to the lead while racing one out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the backside while
racing out from the rail, increased his advantage through the final turn, and widened that margin through the lane while confidently handled. RING OF
KERRY broke sharply and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final
turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to hold the place. KNOPFLER away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from
the rail, tipped three wide soon after entering the backstretch and was asked to creep closer, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished
determinedly two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. I'M A CHI TOO was taken in hand soon after the start, and dropped back to trail, well
behind the field, launched his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while only able to pass a tiring rival. DRILLER
tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages.

KOALA away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, battled for the lead from the inside of QUALITY COMMAND in the run
down the backstretch and through the final turn, briefly appeared to be overtaken entering the lane, but fought back stubbornly from along the rail late to
prevail in the final strides. QUALITY COMMAND broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue
two wide in the run down the backside and through the final turn, looked to take a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to dispose of a very game
rival in the final strides to just miss. ICE BREAKER stalked the leaders in the run down the backside while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside
entering the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact while finishing three wide in the drive.

FINDING WAYS away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage entering the first turn while saving ground at the rail, set a pressured pace from the inside of
FOREIGN PROTOCOL in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival midway through the final turn, and was never
seriously threatened late. TIZ VICIOUS away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, took up the chase two wide
entering the final turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. FOREIGN PROTOCOL rushed up from between rivals in the
run to the first turn to press the pace two wide entering the turn, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was unable to
keep tabs on his pace rival leaving the turn, and finished two wide in the drive to hold on for a share. PARKER POINT was put in tight quarters passing the
wire the first time, and allowed to settle off the contested early pace entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive. COUNTRY COWBOY broke sharply and was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack while
racing three wide into the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, but was unable to mount a serious late bid.

Footnotes
MAKEITORBREAKIT broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of LAUGH WITH me entering the stretch the first time, assumed command
entering the second turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, got the better of LAUGH WITH ME entering the
lane, and drew clear late. LAUGH WITH ME away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, eased off his pace rival
entering the second turn to take a tracking trip into the backside, forced the issue two wide through the final turn, was unable to match strides with his pace
rival entering the lane, and closed two wide in the drive to prove second best. BROKE AN BROKEN ducked in at the start to get away poorly, and settled
well off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, commenced his bid from along the rail entering the final turn, and
finished from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. MY COLLEGE FUND away well and tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing
one out from the rail, advanced three wide soon after entering the backside, rallied two out from the rail through the final turn, but needed more late. FAMILY
BIZ unhurried early while trailing the field three wide entering the lane the first time, remained at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied
three wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon.

Footnotes
ABOVE AVERAGE broke sharply and stalked the leaders from along the rail through the stretch the first time, advanced smartly from along the rail midway
down the backstretch, awaited room approaching the final turn, rallied smartly from along the rail through the turn, tipped two wide to quickly overhaul the
pacesetter entering the lane and drew clear as much the best. ARUNDEL CASTLE settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the
stretch the first time, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, and found her best stride late while finishing four wide in the drive to get up for the
place. MATSQUI away well and stalked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position in the run
down the backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, and closed steadily three wide in the drive to get up for a share. LICORICE away alertly and
pressed the pace from the outside of HOAX into the stretch the first time, took control and raced on a clear lead in the run down the backside, rallied along
the inside through the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the lane, and gave way grudgingly late while finishing two wide in the drive. FREESTYLE
settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three out
from the rail in the drive. FANNY BAY ALI was off awkwardly and drifted out in the opening strides while clipping heels with FREESTYLE, settled well off the
early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, rallied along the rail through the final turn, and finished from along the inside in
the stretch drive while lacking racing room. INDYETTA tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained a
tracking trip in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded in the lane while racing four out from the rail. HOAX set a
pressured pace from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, eased into a tracking trip entering the second turn and in the run down the backside,
began to weaken entering the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.

RACING RIVER away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside while racing out
from the rail, maintained his advantage through the final turn, and held FOOT SOLDIER safely at bay late while finishing four wide in the drive. FOOT
SOLDIER away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, launched his bid three wide entering he final turn, and
finished willingly four wide in the drive to get up for the place. MORETHANSOULTITLE stalked the early pace into the backstretch while saving ground at
the rail, rallied along the inside through the final turn, and closed one out from the rail in the drive to just miss the place. VALUABLE COWBOY broke
sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of RACING RIVER entering the first turn, eased off that rival to gain a tracking trip entering he backstretch,
rallied two wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late going. WISE MARKET settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run
down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. DEPUTY'S DANCER settled
well off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called
upon.
