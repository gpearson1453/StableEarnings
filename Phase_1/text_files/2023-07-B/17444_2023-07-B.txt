Footnotes
LYKAN pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, assumed command, drew off for a clear lead and held under urging. TRY TRY AGAIN raced
close to the pace along the inside, shifted out and bid three wide leaving the turn, closed steadily and was gaining late. GAME BOY BENNY raced in close,
bid six wide leaving the turn and finished well to get up for show. LATIN CASINO pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn, fell back,
altered course in the upper stretch, continued willingly and was caught for third. MEDICINE TAIL set a pressured pace to the turn, fell back and faded from
contention. YOU'RE IN COREY was never far back in an outside trip and lacked the needed late response.

Footnotes
PLUS CHIC took command early, drew off on the turn for a clear lead, was under pressure late and held well. MY LIPS ARE SEALED raced mid pack along
the inside, got through along the rail on the turn, bid willingly to loom a threat, didn't have enough late and finished second best. CHROME ATTACK raced
mid pack, bid inside on the turn and lacked the needed late response. JUST A WONDER was off a step slowly and came out at the start, raced in the back,
was in traffic in the upper stretch, altered course and leveled off. RACEDAY ATTIRE was crowded at the start, saved ground to the turn, angled out in the
upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. JUJU'S SPECIALGIRL broke out, led early, stalked to the turn, swung wide and faded. LIPLINER broke out,
showed good early speed, was carried out on the turn and dropped back.

W W CANDY was a bit crowded at the start, raced outside, rallied on the turn, split horses in tight quarters and bumped leaving the turn, closed willingly and
got up in the final strides. TAPE TO TAPE was hustled along to set the pace, drew off leaving the turn for a clear lead and was caught near the wire. WENT
WEST was crowded at the start, pressed the pace inside, bid along the rail on the turn, shifted out, went willingly to the wire, didn't have enough late and
settled for show in a good effort. MIDNIGHT ESCAPE pressed the pace three wide, fell back a bit on the turn, was in tight and bumped entering the stretch
and continued to close. DEVIL'S TOWER bobbled at the start, advanced to the turn, was in tight and bumped entering the stretch, angled in and leveled off.
NAVY SEAL veered out at the start, trailed the field and offered a mild bid only. KAVOD broke out, pressed the pace between horses, challenged for the
lead on the turn, weakened and faded.
