Footnotes
FANCY PRINCESS , in hand three deep around the turn while disputing the pace, was set down in upper stretch and drew off under brisk urging. O
SHAUGHESEY disputed the pace in the two path between horses to the stretch, raced on her left lead in the drive, weakened and was best of the others.
GOGO CHANEL stumbled at the start, was well off a three wide pace battle and failed to be a factor. TIMELY SECRET showed speed along the inner rail,
was caught in close quarters leaving the backstretch and gave way in the drive.

REMEMBER ME vied outside a rival before clearing heading to the half mile marker, was nudged along two wide maintaining a clear advantage around the
turn, opened up when put to a drive past the three sixteenths then held firm while kept alert. FIRST TO ARRIVE edged up three wide nearing the turn and
prompted outside the winner, failed to quicken with that one soon into the stretch but kept on with good energy to cut back into the margin. VIENNESE
WALTZ , hustled along from the gate, was unable to keep up early, saved ground leaving the three eighths pole, swung out four to five wide for the drive
and finished up nicely. TIZ VINNO vied inside the winner early on, rated back off that heading to the half and angled out, moved back to the rail and edged
up some past the five sixteenths, brushed with SEVERN SPIRIT when pursuing in upper stretch then faded. SEVERN SPIRT broke slowly, gained between
rivals while under asking past the five sixteenths, brushed with a rival in upper stretch and weakened. FOXY CURL unseated her rider when rearing up
leaving the paddock, broke a step slow, gained four wide outside foes mid turn, lacked a response soon into the stretch and gave way.

PERFORMANCEANXIETY prompted the pace while saving ground, eased back off the leader around the far turn, tracked inside foes past the five
sixteenths, angled off the rail in upper stretch, closed in under right handed asks, kept grinding between rivals in deep stretch, was bumped nearing the wire
and just got up. ILLUSION OF HOPE settled off the pace while saving some ground, edged up behind the quartet approaching the stretch, swung out five
wide for the drive, closed steadily outside foes, moved to a slim lead in deep stretch, drifted in a bit bumping the winner and was edged at the wire.
VICTORIAN RIVIERA vied outside the winner early then cleared into the turn, dropped closer to the rail to set the pace, widened a bit under pressure past
the three sixteenths, kept on gamely but couldn't quite contain the top pair. NEED A MARKER , off slowly when rank and hopping at the break, regrouped
and edged up off the rail into the turn, gained three wide to have aim mid turn, pursued four wide from upper stretch to mid stretch then faded. ELLIE
VICTORINA chased the pace off the rail, raced between runners nearing the lane, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. An objection by
the rider of ILLUSION OF HOPE against the winner for alleged interference in deep stretch was not allowed. There was also a stewards' inquiry into the
start of NEED A MARKER. No action was deemed necessary.

IMAGINE IT ALL hugged the inner rail around the turn, found ample room inside HAGGERSDALE leaving the turn to challenge for the lead, drifted out in
upper stretch and prevailed in an extended drive. ICE COLD FROSTY lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the
stretch and rallied. QUINCANNON , four deep around the turn, had a slight rally outside rivals. PRIDE OF PAYTON , a forward factor in the three path
between horses on the turn, weakened in the drive. HAGGERSDALE sped to the early lead, was kept in the two path around the turn, raced on his left lead
in the stretch and gave way.

NOBLE BELIEF broke a step slow, then steadied soon after, regrouped and pulled her way forward three wide and between rivals, prompted the pace
outside GINGER GIRL around the turn, was floated out a bit by that one entering the lane, wrested command soon after, spurted away under right handed
encouragement, widened while steadily hand ridden leaving the sixteenth pole, was given one final right handed ask in deep stretch and prevailed. TOO
MANY KISSES steadied soon after the break, was taken to rate while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, edged up and sat patiently behind a
rival nearing the quarter pole, swung out and was put to pressure when straightening in about the six path in upper stretch, closed sharply through the final
furlong and just missed. FLITTER attended the pace four deep nearing the half mile pole, dropped in a path to stalk mid turn, raced a bit greenly nearing the
stretch, shifted five wide to pursue, angled out late and kept on with interest. GINGER GIRL rushed up along the rail and gained command after about a
furlong, was kept in check with the winner just to her outside, wandered outward entering the stretch, corrected then was headed leaving the three
sixteenths, gave hard chase past the eighth pole then faded a bit through the final seventy yards. GILDA'S GIRL broke on top and led for nearly a furlong,
dropped in around the turn, was under a hustling ride trying to stay in touch past the five sixteenths, failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and faded. QUIT
QUAY broke inward, dropped off the pace, lost ground four wide around the turn and failed to respond.

A C EXPRESSWAY , taken to rate after an alert beginning, stalked outside a rival entering the turn, steadily progressed two wide into the lane, drifted in
while on his left lead past the three sixteenths, bid inside embattled leaders in mid stretch, kicked clear under a drive heading to the sixteenth pole,
remained on his left lead and widened while kept to task. BOBBY G prompted the pace outside ALPHA CHI RO, was put to a strong ride mid turn to stay in
touch, was floated four wide into the lane, ranged up to threaten in mid stretch, kept on with good energy but was second best. ALPHA CHI RHO was
nudged up to take over leaving the chute, cleared and took to rating towards the inside, was guided three wide into the lane, straightened and kept on under
pressure past the three sixteenths, drifted briefly when confronted from both sides in mid stretch then weakened late. CLUBMAN bobbled inward and the
break bumping SILENT MALICE, recovered and rated off the pace while between runners, was under asking into the lane but failed to seriously get
involved. ONE TEN bobbled at the break, settled three deep early on, gained a bit while four wide approaching the stretch, shifted out wider and came up
empty. JACKIE A saved ground stalking the pace, was under a hustling ride past the three eighths, failed to kick on in mid stretch and weakened. SILENT
MALICE , off slow after being bumped, lost ground four wide into the turn and lacked a rally. HOT N SPICY LOVE saved ground, steadied when in close
quarters leaving the three eighths, swung well wide for the drive and gave way.

LOOKING FOR WATER , confidently rated down the backstretch, found room through the stretch, swept to command approaching the eighth pole then
pulled away under some encouragement. IMAGINETHEODDS prompted the pace outside ALICORN around the turn, bid for the lead while fanned three
wide by that one in upper stretch then finished willingly. ALICORN set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out a bit turning for home then steadily weakened.
STAGE CALL saved ground on the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and gave way. RIA FORMOSA circled the turn three wide, floated four deep
turning for home and faltered.
