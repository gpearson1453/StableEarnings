Footnotes
PERFECT TOM was on the bit in the first turn, was angled in and asked to rate behind the front runners, saved ground, launched a bid at the five sixteenth
pole, lengthened his stride moving into the stretch, shifted out at the three sixteenth pole, was asked and encouraged at the eighth pole, where he found
another gear and drew off willingly. WESTERN STAR showed natural speed early, took the lead and the rail, raced in hands with a stalking rival to the
outside, launched a bid at the three eighths pole, drew ahead, was encouraged and driven down the lane but could not sustain the bid and flattened out,
was still good enough for second place today. NINEJUANJUAN CALL was off a tad slow, raced on the rail from off of the pace, and put in a mild bid late.
JUDGMENTAL hopped at the start, was four wide and racing mid pack but had no impact. MAGIC LIGHTNING vied for the lead, stalked just off of the
leader, raced three wide and faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
COASTAL CHAOS vied for the early lead from the outside, angled in and briefly raced between two other rivals on the lead, let the rival to the far outside go
before the half mile pole and stalked that one, matched strides while stalking the leader through the turn, raced into the stretch still in company, repelled his
company horse, challenged for the lead after he sixteenth pole, cleared that rival right before the wire and got up in time for the win. BIG STORY vied for the
lead, aced four wide on the far outside, went on and took the lead before the half mile pole, set the pace, was given more rein at the the three eighths pole,
was in full stride moving into the stretch, showed the way home but was caught in the last few jumps and had to settle for second place today. FETCHS
BRAHM stalked the front runners in the two path, advanced on the inside and matched strides with the eventual winner at the seven sixteenth pole,
matched strides into the stretch, dropped down to the rail but did not have enough today for the win but ran a respectable third. RED RAIDER XPRESS
raced from mid pack in between rivals in the three path, launched a bid at the three eighth s pole, improved position into the stretch but had no late rally.
COUNTRY CUT was off a step slow, raced from off of the pace, stayed on the rail, angled out into the five path at the quarter pole, was asked at the top of
the lane, responded well closing but had to much ground to make up. BUTWAITTHERE'SMORE bumped at the start, raced on the rail, was inside of other
foes, ran an even race. NOBLE HONOR vied for the lead, raced on the rail and briefly co led, drifted out into the four path near the three eighth s pole and
faded. SLIM JIMMY was four wide, raced from mid pack but was never involved. MORO LEGEND was two wide while racing mid pack, then tired. DENS
DEVILLE stumbled at the start, recovered and was bumped by another foe, raced off of the pace and never got involved.
