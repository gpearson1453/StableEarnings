Footnotes
ROYAL BLOOD stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, vied turning for home before wrestling an advantage in upper stretch and drove clear
through the final furlong. AUNT JO bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide, vied between horses while holding a narrow advantage around
the turn, but was headed by her outer counterpart in upper stretch, kept on while bested in the final furlong and held place. THE PRINCESS SAYS tracked
two wide and between horses while just off the leaders into the turn, shifted four wide to take aim outside of the leading trio approaching the quarter pole,
but only managed to chase evenly through the lane. ZIGGZAPPA saved ground while trailing, picked up stride and moved up inside of rivals turning of
home, shifted outwardly through upper stretch, but leveled off without reaching contention. SOULFUL TARA was briefly fractious in the starting gate,
bumped with an outer rival upon leaving it, set the pace along the inside, sparred with a pair of outer bidders passing the three furlong pole, but yielded to
them nearing the lane. INSIGHTFUL MISS received simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, tugged under snug restraint while stalking
inside of rivals and just off the inner rail approaching the turn, but took an awkward step approaching the five sixteenths pole causing the rider to take firm
hold and steady, then failed to recover while shifting ground outwardly. I GOTTA BOLT pursued from off of the pace four wide and outside of the main
group, then gave way around the turn.

Footnotes
GET THROUGH tracked in the two path, gained into the far turn to bid for the lead in the three path and between horses at the five sixteenths pole, led
leaving that marker, drove clear in the final furlong and held from an outer pursuer late. PAID IN FULL bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked along
the inside, tugged behind the pace setter entering the backstretch before slipping through inside of that one to offer a bid at the five furlong pole, vied
approaching the far turn, but was outmoved by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths marker, chased entering the lane, shifted outwardly in upper stretch and
regained momentum, then gradually closed in outside of the clear leader in the late stages but needed more. MAGNA RULER set the pace in the two path,
vied with an inner bidder down the backstretch, led into the far turn, but was headed by an outer challenger at the five sixteenths pole, kept on through
midstretch, but yielded entering the final sixteenth yet held show late. BORN FLAWLESS stalked in the three path, moved outside of the eventual winner's
advance into the far turn to press four wide at the three furlong pole, but failed to sustain a bid and yielded nearing the lane. PUNCTUALITY bumped with an
rival before steadying out of tight quarters between horses at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, pursued form the two path around the far turn
but lacked a rally. ATTEST broke a step slow and made little impact two wide. RONITHELIMODRIVER laid off of the pace in the three to four path,
improved to track down the backstretch, but tired around the far turn.

Footnotes
CAMP DADDY chased in the two path early on, shifted out entering the turn, gained four wide around the bend to offer a bid at the quarter pole, led leaving
that station and drew off under a drive. UNCLE BERLEY trailed in the three to four path, advanced in the five path turning for home to bid for place in upper
stretch, gained place at the furlong grounds and was second best. BOLT ABOVE vied inside of a pair of rivals, checked subtly while unable to sustain
position at the half mile pole, tipped out and tracked two wide and between horses around the turn, but steadied when brushed and put to tight quarters by
rivals on both sides at the quarter pole, yet stayed on through the lane to gain show in the final sixteenth. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS vied three deep early
on, inched ahead of inner rival into the turn, showed the way in the two path around the bend, but was headed by an outer bidder passing the quarter pole
and gave way through the lane. CHARLIE WHISKEY vied two wide and between horses, tucked to the inside leaving the half mile pole before stalking his
outer counterpart from the pocket around the turn, but required a firm left rein to keep from bearing out at the quarter pole and faded through the lane.
GETTIN PAID stalked four wide, pressed the leader from the three path while under urging at the three furlong pole, but was outmoved by an outer bidder
and yielded nearing the quarter pole, brushed an inner rival while faltering at that marker, weakened entering the lane and was eased through the final
furlong.

Footnotes
HASHTAG WINNER settled at the rear, picked up stride in the four path and between horses approaching the three furlong pole, took dead aim in the five
path while looming a danger outside of the embattled leading pair at the quarter pole, bid while well in hand and getting floated to the seven path entering
the lane, assumed command in upper stretch and drew off under light coaxing before being put to wraps late. SET THE PACE dueled for the lead inside of a
rival while remaining multiple paths off of the inner rail, sparred in the three path around the far turn, bore to the five path entering the lane as an outer rival
joined the fray, proved no match for that bidder in upper stretch yet maintained place through the final furlong. JERSEY GOLD tracked in the three path, got
surpassed by inner rivals to trail the field in the five path leaving the three furlong pole, tucked back down to the three path around the far turn before tipping
back out in midstretch and improving between horses late. PRIDDIS leaned outwardly a touch while last away at the start, dueled for the lead outside of a
rival while in the four to five path, battled in the four path around the far turn, but got carried out to the six path while getting outkicked by an outer bidder
entering the lane and faded. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI laid off of the pace in the two path and lacked a bid before tiring.

Footnotes
BLUE EYED GEORGE checked among foes entering the first turn, raced in the bit two wide and between horses whilst midpack around the first turn, shifted
to the four path and outside of foes to settle entering the backstretch, stalked three wide around the far turn, inched closer nearing the lane, produced a bid
in the five path and outside of the leaders spinning into upper stretch, led reaching the furlong grounds and drove clear. MUGATU prompted the pace inside
of a rival early on before easing back in the latter half of the first turn, shifted out to the three path and re-engaged his pace partner from the outside entering
the backstretch, sparred for the lead around the far turn, forged an advantage while shifting to the four path nearing the lane, but was outkicked and bested
by a outer rival entering midstretch, gave way and held place late. CASPER settled well back in the two path, pursued from the four path around the far turn
before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, took contact from an inner rival at the furlong grounds and rallied willingly but needed more for place.
DEPICTION broke a step slow and raced at the rear along the inside, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, but encountered traffic in upper stretch,
bumped an outer rival twice while finding clear sailing in midstretch and stayed on mildly. ONE RED CENT pursued from midpack along the inside, then in
the two path around the far turn, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, but took a pair of bumps from an inner rival in midstretch, transferred the second
contact the to an outer rival at the furlong grounds and yielded. VIVA VOCE tracked in the three path, was driven in pursuit while two wide and between
horses around the far turn, then gave way. BRIE'S MISSION settled off of the pace in the four path, tucked to the two path before taking the far turn in the
three path and failed to factor. PURE POETRY set the pace two wide early on, then inside of a rival while in the two path down the backstretch, dueled
around the far turn, but was headed nearing the lane, yielded in upper stretch, drifted out and across a rival's path at the furlong grounds causing him to
have his hind heels clipped by that one in the process, and was eased up and protected through the late stages. MIGHTY KAI had his head turned left as
the gates opened causing him to come out a step slow, raced at the rear in the three path and was outrun around the far turn. J T'S IMAGINATION stalked
in the two path before tucking along the rail around the first turn, chased around the far turn, tipped back to the two path in upper stretch, but clipped PURE
POETRY's hind heels when that rival drifted across his path at the furlong grounds, altered course inwardly in recovery and was eased through the late
stages.

CONDON CANDY set the pace two wide, drew off at the three furlong pole and widened under busy handling. REGAL RUMOR bumped with an inner rival
at the start, tracked four wide, ranged up to bid for place outside of MUSICAL DIVA turning for home, chased that foe through midstretch yet edged past her
crossing the sixteenth marker. MUSICAL DIVA prompted the pace three wide, chased the clearing leader leaving the three furlong pole, resisted an outer
challenge for place at the quarter pole, maintained that position through midstretch, but was bested leaving the sixteenth pole. PEIGNOIR pursued from
midpack five wide while under a drive around the turn, sustained stride to gain fourth entering the lane and failed to threaten the top trio. LEGACY DEFINED
brushed the outer half of the gate while off a step slow, lacked speed in the three path, crept closer before encountering traffic among foes at the quarter
pole, tipped four wide entering the lane and moved up between rivals. AURACULOUS broke a step slow, lagged behind in the four path, swung to the seven
path entering the lane fane and failed to factor. OUR KEEPSAKE bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased two wide and between horses under
consistent and strong coaxing, then weakened through the lane. SWEET VIOLET lacked speed along the inside, checked subtly nearing the lane and made
little impact. LITTLE MISS PRISS pursued from midpack along the inside, but was shuffled behind a tiring rival at the quarter pole and faded between
horses. MISS ESCAPADE vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, proved no match for that one at the three furlong pole and wilted turning for home.

Footnotes
LEMON BOMB set the pace along the inside, drew away from chasing foes nearing the lane, maintained a clear margin under light urging through
midstretch, but lugged out severely entering the final sixteenth yet held sway safely. FROTHY stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the leader
around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with that one nearing the lane, lost place to an inner foe in midstretch, yet sustained the duel for that position
through the final furlong and reclaimed place late. BOLTORO dropped his rider leaving the post parade and ran loose briefly before being caught by an
outrider, tracked two wide and between horses, saved ground around the far turn, improved inside of rivals entering the lane, narrowly forged place from an
outer foe at the furlong grounds, sparred with that rival through the late stages and got bested. OKAY FINE broke outwardly, saved ground off of the pace,
improved entering the lane and gained fourth at the furlong grounds. CATMINT stalked three wide, but lost position between horses approaching the far
turn, chased two wide from midpack around that bend, tipped back three wide entering the lane, but lacked a bid. MILIEU was last away, lacked speed in
the three path, fanned six wide entering the lane and moved up. MO BLOOMS pursued three wide and between horses, tipped four wide in upper stretch
and to menace. ENGLISH CHARM tracked four wide but weakened five wide entering the lane. JUNGLE CAT bore wide while rank around the first turn,
pulled and advanced outside of rivals down the backstretch, but weakened turning for home. BE MISS HATTIE took a brush from an inner rival at the start,
tugged between horses entering the first turn to prompt the pace two wide, chased the clear leader from the three path around the far turn, yielded turning
for home, then shied from inner rivals and steadied entering the lane before easing up thereafter.

Footnotes
ELI'S PROMISE set the pace along the inside, disposed of a pressing rival while meeting an outer challenge at the quarter pole, repelled that bidder in
upper stretch and held sway. LUPO'S LEGACY stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair approaching the three furlong pole, ranged up to
offer a bid nearing the lane, but was turned away by the pace setter in upper stretch and lasted for place. EMPERADOR lagged behind in the two path,
swung to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied outside of rivals in the final furlong to narrowly reach show at the wire. MIDASWELLRUN tracked three
wide, chased four wide around the turn, lacked progress in upper stretch, yet ran on along with an outer rival in the late stages. STAND FOR FREEDOM
saved ground off of the pace, chased along the rail through the lane but flattened out. RIDER'S SPECIAL tracked two wide, chased in the two to three path
around the turn, but lacked the needed kick to offer a bid before being outfinished by rivals on both sides in the closing stages. BACKSIDE BUZZ bobbled at
the start, lacked speed while hung in the five path around the turn and tired on his left lead. SUPREMELY laid off of the pace in the three path and between
horses, then failed to factor. MISSIN CURFEW pressed two wide, then between horses turning for home, but weakened nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SANT' ANTIMO stalked three wide, bid at the three furlong pole, led narrowly turning for home and kicked away entering the lane. BROWN LIQUOR MAN
stalked along the inside, split foes two wide in upper stretch after the leader drew off, gained place from an outer rival at the furlong grounds and was
second best. SIMPLY JACK saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing room nearing the lane, encountered traffic while off of the fence in upper stretch,
knifed through rivals while rallying, shifted out at the sixteenth pole and sustained progress to reach show at the wire. DRAMA CRITIC settled off of the pace
two wide and between horses, shifted out to the five path entering the backstretch, gained five wide around the far turn to reach place in upper stretch, but
lost that position to an inner rival at the furlong grounds and got nailed at the wire for show. SPUNS SON was slow into stride, trailed along the inside,
shifted out around the far turn to spin into the lane six wide and moved up. LEFT POCKET MONEY altered course outside of rivals around the first turn to
track four wide, tucked back to the two path at the five furlong pole, brushed his way four wide in upper stretch, chased between horses through midstretch,
but checked from an inner rival at the sixteenth pole. AUTO DIAL raced forwardly two wide and between horses, pursued three to four wide around the far
turn, but was outkicked by rivals in upper stretch and weakened. TEXCOCO pressed two wide, vied between horses around the far turn but caved entering
the lane. POST TENEBRAS LUX set the pace along the inside, got headed while inside of a pair of foes around the far turn and weakened on his left lead.
BON BUENO pursued from midpack in the three path, but was brushed five wide by an inner rival while between horses in upper stretch and yielded.
ROYAL DECADENCE shied to the six path from an inner rival at the seven furlong pole while racing in midpack, then gave way four wide around the far
turn. SECRET EDGE laid off of the pace three wide before fanning to the six path entering the backstretch and weakened around the far turn.
