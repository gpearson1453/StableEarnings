into the backstretch, improved off the rail on the far turn and cleared second mid-stretch. COUSIN WINNIE stalked two deep, challenged toward the three
eighths pole but dropped back past the pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and flattened in the lane. BREADMAN'S ROSEBUD saved ground well back
from early contention, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and finished evenly to close the gap. GILDED QUEST stalked

SCARLET REBEL was bumped at the break then pressured the early pace, raced in hand leaving the three eighths pole, resumed chase into the turn but
settled for second. MEGEEZER came away awkwardly and made contact with Scarlet Rebel, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path
on the turn and came along for third. VERY VENUS gave close early chase inside, rounded the turn at the rail then flattened in the lane.
KNOBIESMAGICSONDE lunged and ducked out at the break, gave chase leaving the chute, rounded the turn in the four path and showed little in the lane.
LUZIA was shuffled back leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and passed some rivals in the lane.
UNALTERED gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path and showed little in the lane. BIT OF BLESSINGS was forced in at the break and
never factored. AUNT TOOTY gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and weakened. CAJUN CASHEW was bumped leaving the gate, gave chase

LADRO DI FICHI saved ground off the pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then eased out entering the
stretch and dug in to get up the final yards. ARROWWOOD saved early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead in the three path
entering the stretch, dueled briefly clear inside the sixteenth pole but was caught in the final yards. KATALIMA steadied at the rail into the first turn and
raced well off the pace leaving the turn, bid approaching the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and came along for third later
yards. BEST VIRGINIA saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and took the nod between horses past the quarter pole but was met
into the lane and weakened the final sixteenth. SWEET FACTOR exchanged contact with JACCACI leaving the gate then rounded the first turn in the four
path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn at the rail and could only improve her position. The latter exchanged contact with
Sweet Factor leaving the gate, rounded the first turn off the rail and showed little response through the backstretch. BROADWAY PEGGY rated close inside,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened. LADY CINCO DE MAYO came away awkwardly and rounded
the first turn in the four path, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then faded through the far turn. WINDSOR'S PLAY took over and angled to
the inside to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was met at the quarter and faded through the far turn.

leaving the three eighths pole, improved at the rail on the far turn, cleared second passing the eighth pole but was no match in the lane. JUBA'S NOTION
raced with the early pace two deep, challenged nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back past the five sixteenths and flattened in the lane.
GRUMPY'S BUDDY settled inside then gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. ROAD

Footnotes
CENTERFOLD ANGEL raced with the early pace three wide, took the nod toward the seven sixteenths pole and raced clear nearing the five sixteenths,
came under pressure into the far turn, rounded the turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. THUNDERTURTLE saved ground, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn then dueled through the stretch to take the nod for second. EMMA AND I saved
ground racing well back from early contention, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, entered the far turn near the rail, angled to the six path through
the turn, dug in through the stretch but missed the nod for second. SHERIFF'S KID raced with the early pace two deep and between horses, gave chase
into the backstretch, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened the final sixteenth. SOCIAL EXCLUSION rounded the first turn about the five path, picked
up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, then weakened in the lane. MISS WILD raced off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and showed little in the stretch. CICI UNIFIED raced with the
pace inside, was met approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, but weakened at the rail on the far turn. ONEPRETTYTHING
rounded the opening turn about the six path and showed little response through the backstretch. SHEMADEMELUCKY dwelt then ducked out leaving the
gate and rounded the first turn in the four path.
