Footnotes
RIMROCK LAKE tracked the early pace, loomed five wide through the turn, took control in early stretch and edged clear for the win. CHESHIRE KID set a
pressured early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, couldn't match strides with the winner, tired late and held for second. DIGITAL SOLDIER pressed
the early pace from between rivals and gave way. WELL IMAGINE THAT was unhurried early, raced six wide through the turn and offered no late rally.
GENERAL CROOK was reserved off the pace, went three wide into the turn, drifted in mid stretch and offered no late rally. CONRAD MEADOWS drifted in
soon after the start, was void of any early speed, raced four wide through the turn and never recovered. CONNECTER stalked from the inside and faded.
