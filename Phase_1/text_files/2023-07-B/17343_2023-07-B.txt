Footnotes
MAKE UP A STORY dropped inside to save ground mid pack, angled out into the turn, bid four wide, closed steadily and wore down
PAYINGOFFMYMARKER to get up late. PAYINGOFFMYMARKER set a pressured pace, inched away on the turn, led to the final strides and was
outfinished. MARK IT DOWN bobbled after the start, stalked the pace, angled in for the drive, lacked the needed rally and settled for show. NOT TO FANCY
came in and was steadied at the start, was taken wide and fell far back, advanced to the turn and closed well. STORM IN THE VALLE pressed the pace
along the inside to the turn and gave way. KENTUCKY GOLD raced five wide along the backstretch, showed speed to the turn and gave way. STREET
MARK raced six wide along the backstretch, showed speed to the turn and gave way.

the stretch, closed with a rush and was gaining late. RONCHETTI came in at the start, stalked the pace and lacked the needed late response. LATIGO
ELLIS bobbled and came in at the start, vied to the turn, leveled off and fell back. KID CUSTER hesitated at the start to be off slowly and failed to threaten in
an even effort. HORNS N HALOS bumped at the start, was never far back, bid inside on the turn and lacked a rally. SHUG'S ROCKET showed good early
speed, was taken off the rail on the backstretch and steadily faded. VIPER BREATH broke in and bumped at the start and was outrun. FOOL ON A STOOL
pulled up and was vanned off.

Footnotes
WHEREDOESTHECASHGO broke sharply and led throughout. DOS REALES raced mid pack, bid five wide between horses, closed in traffic and was
gaining late. DECK HUMOR was slow early, bid inside on the turn and finished well to earn show. JAZZ MAN DO stalked the pace, bid four wide entering
the stretch, was within range and hung late to lose position. REINING PESOS raced close to the pace in a wide trip, was in traffic in the stretch and lacked
the needed rally. HIT A NOTE raced in the back in an even effort and failed to menace. HE'S NO YOKE stalked the pace to the turn, stopped and was not
urged late. THE GREAT DOME raced in close, stopped into the turn and was not urged late.
