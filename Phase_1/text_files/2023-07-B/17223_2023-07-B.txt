Footnotes
WHISKEY SIS stalked the pace early, made a bid from between horses nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane and edged clear late in the
stretch under a steady drive. E STREET ANGEL lunged at the start, chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and rallied for place late in the
stretch run. CAJUN DELIGHT tracked the pace early, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was in the five path into the lane, continued the bid down the
lane but flattened out and lost place at the wire. NANA'S GRAY set the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faltered late in the stretch drive.
LA CUMPARSITA was never a factor. FOOT RUB LOVE chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch,
vanned off after the race.
