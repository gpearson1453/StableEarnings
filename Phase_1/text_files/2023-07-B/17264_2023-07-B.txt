in the three path around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. DOMO ARIGATOU chased the pace in the two path, could not

Footnotes
ANTRIM settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took a narrow lead near the five-sixteenths marker, dueled
outside of R AWESOME SAUCE from there to deep stretch and drove clear late. R AWESOME SAUCE raced in range inside, made a rail bid midway
around the far turn, dueled inside of the winner from there to deep stretch and settled for second best late. SUBTLE SENORITA pressed the pace two wide,
drew clear down the backstretch, was caught on both sides near the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the top two from there but kept trying and
regained the show. CASTLE BORN lacked early speed while racing three wide, went six wide around the far turn and rallied belatedly. LOVELY DRAMA
was unprepared for the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened. BREAKING BULLET chased the pace inside, was shuffled back
down the backstretch, re-bid two wide around the far turn, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. HYDRIA failed to menace
while racing four and five wide. RANSOM STYLE played no factor while racing three and four wide. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY raced in range four wide,
advanced outside down the backstretch, chased between foes rounding the far turn and retreated nearing the quarter pole. BRITNEY SPURS set the early
pace inside, was through early and was eased.

LA RUNA set the pace in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path midway around the turn, tipped back out to the three path at the top of the lane,
and was driven clear. SHE'S A JOY bumped with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the two path, tipped out midway around the turn and was cued from the
six path into the stretch, and chased on for place. MILES OF SMILES bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the five path, fanned out to the eight
path into the stretch, and kept on for show. AVE FENIX tracked along the rail but flattened while drifting out down the lane. TRIBUTE prompted the pace in
the four path but yielded turning into the stretch. VACATION SUITE laid off the pace in the four path but never menaced.

CUPID'S DUDE stalked in the two path, was coaxed early around the far turn, cut the corner to bid into the stretch, and stayed on in a duel with an outer foe
to the wire to split the win. MILLENNIUM CONDO prompted the pace in three path, took the lead midway around the far turn, dueled with an inner foe from
the two path down the lane, and dug in to hold a share of the win. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK brushed with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path,
was roused midway around the far turn, took aim from the six path into the stretch, and kept on. FORTY FLASH brushed with an inner foe then had to
steady at the start, rated in the two path, angled out to the six path in upper stretch, and mildly gained. T VILLE set the pace in the two path, but lost the
lead midway around the far turn, and faded. D. SILO tracked in the four path but flattened down the lane. EUPHORIA STAR trailed in the four path early and
did not threaten. SWIFT KID raced off the pace inside but never menaced.

Footnotes
LONG RANGE TODDY had his head turned at the start, prompted the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths pole and drew clear in the lane.
VIVIR CON ALEGRIA (CHI) set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner near the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with that foe in
the lane but kept on well to be a clear second. GANGLY settled off the pace while racing three wide and was along late for the show. ZYDECEAUX pressed
the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths marker, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. LIGHTNING TONES trailed
while racing in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
BALTIC MULE raced prominently alongside the pacesetter in the four path, bid in the three path rounding the turn, dueled with the inner pacesetter into the
stretch and inched away in the final sixteenth. SKYHOOPER set the pace in the three path, was roused from the two path when challenged by an outer foe
midway around the turn, dug in and dueled with that foe down the lane, but yielded in the final sixteenth to place. UNCAPTURED TIGER rated inside, was
driven between foes in the two path midway around the turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. ETRETAT raced off
the pace in the four path, shifted in to the two path entering the lane, and made no impact. COMMANDER BIZ chased in the six path, floated out to the
seven path into the stretch, and flattened. ARTE DE GUERRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the five path and passed tired foes down the
lane. NOBLE TIGER bumped with an inner foe at the start, was prompted along in range around the five path, but was empty at the top of the stretch.
LUCKY DONNIE G stalked in the two path but backed up around the turn. BLACK SHAMAN was wellback in the three path and never a menace. THE
FRACTIONAL TIMES FOR THIS RACE ARE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE.
