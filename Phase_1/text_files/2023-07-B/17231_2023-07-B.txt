Footnotes
BIG JAVA rated four deep from the outside of foes, dropped in a b it around the far turn and drew off to be well clear under steady encouragement. ELLIE
DELI showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside of rivals but was no match for Big Java in the drive. HARDLY MISCHIEVOUS dropped
back off the early going, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, angled out through the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. PACIFIC
GROVE raced off the early pace, angled to widest in the stretch and never threatened. SNOWCREST stalked the pace, moved up to challenge three deep
between rivals near the three eighths pole and faded in the drive. PUGLIA raced far back and was eased up on in the stretch.

BACKGROUND showed good early speed from the inside of foes, raced to the outside of Ethical Judgement in the stretch and edge up late under strong
handling. ETHICAL JUDGEMENT tracked the early leader from the outside, moved up from the inside of Background through the stretch and finished
gamely to the wire. RISING EMPIRE stalked the pace from the outside, made a four wide near the quarter pole and weakened in the drive. VINTAGE
PRINT settled off the early going, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole, was five deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. DON'T
FORGET angled in through the inside, stalked the pace near the rail down the backstretch, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

COPPA GIRL tracked outside of Heart Headed Woman, took command through the far turn and raced well clear under a mild hand ride to be a handy
winner. HEART HEADED WOMAN showed good early speed from the inside but was no match for the winner in the drive. QUEEN OF MISSOULA stalked
the pace, raced four wide into the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. EXCELLENT QUESTION stalked the pace from the outside of foes, raced
three wide near the quarter pole and weakened. BIG DIG was allowed to settle early on, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.
DOMINA was void of early speed and never was a factor. GRACE'S GIFT forwardly placed along the inside to lay up close, tired readily, was eased through
the lane before being distanced and walking off.

Footnotes
FOGO ISLAND showed good early foot from the inside, raced just off the inside lane and held gamely to prove best under strong encouragement. WINDY
BAY stalked the top trio down the backstretch, took aim at the leader near the three sixteenths pole but couldn't get by to finish second best while racing
from the outside. C C CRUISE CONTROL settled off the early going, moved up along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and finished willingly
to the wire. JENNY LIND raced off the early pace setters, moved up two deep past the five sixteenth pole, raced six deep in the lane and was even late with
no closing run. DESTINE TO RACE stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and was empty. KATIE GOT LUCKY was void of early speed
and never was a factor. ARDEN'S ASSAULT prompt the early leader from the outside, tired readily and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
RED HOT ROD showed good early foot to set the early pace racing three deep and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. ZARTOWNIS vied
for the early lead from the inside of Red Hot Rod but was no match for the winner in the drive. CUSTOM BOBBY'S was bumped at the start, chased from
the outside, raced five wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire while racing from the outside. GILDED RULER stalked the pace from the outside,
raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit through the drive. PROTEGE bumped with Custom Bobby's at the start, raced mid pack
early on, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced even late with no closing run. FADETHENOISE was slow early on, raced two to three
wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. SWIMMINGWITHSHARKS coaxed from the outside, raced five wide past the three eighth pole and never
threatened. MIDNIGHT HURRICANE settled near the back of the pack early on, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a
bid.
