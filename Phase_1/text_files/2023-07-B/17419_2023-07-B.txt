Footnotes
TEEWINOT PASS settled off the pace between foes, split rivals at the eighth pole then rallied to get up in time. DADASHEV prompted the pace three wide
and continued willingly to the finish. WE BE THERE raced wide throughout, loomed a stretch threat but was outfinished. OUCH OUCH OUCH alternated for
the lead outside to midstretch and faltered. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM led then dueled inside, lost the whip at the five sixteenths pole and weakened.
DANGNABBIT hesitated at the start, moved up inside then faltered. LOAD UP MOE lagged far behind then trailed throughout.

MERCY MERCY forced the pace inside, led into the stretch and pulled away while kept to her business. B B'S ROCKET stalked the pacesetters three wide,
bid on the turn and proved second best. TONALA trailed far behind then offered late energy to gain the show. WHAT A BEAUT raced four wide off the
leaders and rallied mildly. JULIET'S MUSIC dueled outside with the winner, bore out at the quarter pole and faded. PECAN PATTIE raced in midpack,
moved inside on the turn and was no factor. ADVOCATE HARBOR moved briefly closer into the far turn then faltered. J J LOVES BILLY dropped back
early, moved extremely wide into the stretch. ASSUME CONTROL prompted the pace for three furlongs and stopped.

wide, went after the winner on the final turn then made gradual late gain just missing. GRAND PICK reserved inside, bid closer before half a mile then
faltered. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE clipped heels and bobbled badly causing his rider to lose his irons on the first turn, rider got back in irons about an eighth
of a mile later and was no factor. BATTUTA D'ORO dropped back outside, remained wide and had no response. REX KWON DO dropped back in the
opening quarter inside, angled wide on the final turn and was no factor. TITANIUM RECKAGE had his heels clipped on the first turn and stopped abruptly.
The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident on the first turn.

Footnotes
IT'S GAME TIME raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, took over at the five sixteenths pole and drew away under steady pressure. SENIOR
INVESTMENT hustled off the pace outside, rallied on the final turn but was no match for the winner. BRETT'S WORLD far behind early, advanced inside tp
get up for the show. SILVER EDGE was urged to a clear lead early, led to midway on the final turn and tired. FAST BOB raced off the leaders inside and
was never in contention. CAUSALISTIC raced well behind outside, moved wider in the stretch and was no threat. CRYPT trailed early, advanced very wide
on the final turn then faded. SACRED RIDER lacked speed and gave way readily.

Footnotes
OLYMPIC ROMP settled inside, angled out advancing on the final turn, collared the leader and rallied clear. GHOSTINYOU trailed far behind then offered
late energy along the inside to gain the place. CITY RAGE vied inside briefly, bid to the front on the final turn then faltered. GENGHIS moved closer three
wide before half a mile and weakened. YES SIR COLONEL lacked speed chasing wide and lacked a rally. ET'S MAGIC MAN hustled to the front to the far
turn then stopped abruptly.
