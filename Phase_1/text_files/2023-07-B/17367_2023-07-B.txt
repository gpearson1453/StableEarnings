Footnotes
NEWPARK (IRE) broke out, went to rail and vied for lead on the backstretch, continued on the rail on the turn, drifted out late on the turn and into the three
path in upper stretch, met bid and switched leads in upper stretch, responded and edged away. RUNAWAY WYWY tracked duo off the rail on the
backstretch, advanced on the turn in the four path, launched bid in the five path and got up for second. MINDSHARE off slow and came out to bump rival at
the start, sent to vie for lead two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane in the three path, proved no match and lost second
late. B D R DRAGSTER off bit slow, lacked speed and trailed on the backstretch, continued to save ground on the turn and made mild improvement to pass
one rival in the lane. NAUGHTY CHILD broke in and bumped with rival at the start, tracked dueling rivals on the backstretch, continued well placed on the
turn and offered no response in the lane. PLEASE NOTE, RACE WAS HAND TIMED
