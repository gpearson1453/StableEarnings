the pace two wide and came three wide off the turn and could not go with the winner while being clearly second best. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA chased the
pace on the inside and had no kick while getting up for the show award on the inside. WOODS HOLE stalked the pace three wide and came four wide into
the lane but was empty. RED PEPPER GRILL was settled early, two wide by the quarter pole and had no rally. JUST NORTH was settled early, three wide

ELUSIVE reserved off the early pace under patient handling, rallied midway on the turn to engage the leaders in upper stretch and cleared off down the
lane. LUNAR MISSION stalked the pace for the first half mile, moved up three wide to take command at the quarter pole and kept on for the place while
unable to hold off the winner. DR. HYDE trailed the pack to the top of the lane and rallied belatedly to be gaining late. ROUNDBALL ROCK pressed the
early pace on the first turn, engaged the pacesetter to duel down the backside and continued on through the turn from between to battle on the lead and
weakened in upper stretch. ZINFATUATION sped to the lead in the first turn, dueled from the rail to midway on the far turn and flattened out.

FUNNY ENOUGH was well rated on the inside, swung out three wide leaving the turn and made a bid to draw clear in the final furlong to prove best under
right handed crop urging. TAK E LADY set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the furlong marker and could not go with that rival while staying
on to be clearly second best. LA BRODY stalked the pace and made a two wide bid on the turn to vie for command but weakened in the final furlong, bested
rest. BIONDA SUPRISE was settled early, between rivals on the backstrech and had no rally. TOSS A COIN was off a step slow, moved up three wide and
was roused on the turn and tired.

WALT WHITMAN (IRE) unhurried early to the turn, circled four wide to close ground, took control turning for home and drew clear. CERTAIN tracked the
leaders from two wide through the turn and rallied down the lane to be second best. THEOLOVESAWINNER was away alertly and reined in to sit behind the
dueling leaders, tried to make a inside bid off the turn but was in tight and blocked to the furlong marker, angled out nearing the sixteenth marker and was
along for the show award . KAMIKAZE FOX sped to the front to duel on the lead to the top of the lane and kept on through the stretch willingly. NORTH
HIGHLAND saved ground racing along the fence near the rear of the field and passed weakening rival in the lane having never threatened. RENNIE sped
up to engage the early leader, dueled through the turn and tired in the lane. MO TOWN BLUES was never a factor.

Footnotes
SASSY BEAST was away alertly to set the early pace, pressured on the turn on the inside, then drew clear leaving the turn to be clear by the furlong marker
and then held sway late to prove best, driving. CAN'T BUY LOVE was reserved early, inside on the turn, came four wide into the lane, in traffic to the furlong
marker, shifted out and closed fast late, second best. TRAIN TO ARTEMUS stalked the pace three wide and lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest.
TALKIN TIPSY was rated early and steadied slightly by the half mile marker, between rivals on the turn and came five wide into the lane but had no kick.
LEMOS CUNHA was outrun early, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. RAMBERT chased the pace on the inside and had no rally. MOOR
STRENGTH was settled back early on the inside, swung three wide leaving the turn and improved late. FULMINATE broke in the air at the start, raced four
wide on the turn and had no rally. KOTYLE tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. REPASADO was rushed up between rivals and pressed the
winner two wide on the turn and weakened. TREVESS chased the pace three wide and weakened.

Footnotes
FRONT RUN THE FED settled in-hand at the back of the field while patiently handled, gained ground in the turn, searched for racing room in upper stretch,
split horses inside the final sixteenth and surged through the hole late to be up in time. YES AND YES saved ground through the turn while tracking the
pacesetters, angled out four wide at the top of the lane, responded well when called upon to overtake the front-runners in deep stretch and was just
out-finished by the winner in a good effort. CAROTARI pressed the pace from two wide, engaged the leader in upper stretch looming boldly, dueled with that
one down the lane and inched ahead but was collared late by the two closers in a game try. YES I AM FREE sped to the lead in rapid fractions under
pressure the whole way, dueled on through the lane and weakened late in the drive. SMOKIN' JAY chased the pace from three wide and could not mount a
closing rally when called upon turning for home. GEAR JOCKEY well placed in the second flight while racing between horses and flattened out turning for
home.

rest. WILMA FLINTSHIRE chased the early pace, shifted out and was three wide by the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane and had no rally. ONE
COOL CHICK set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. SIPPIN' TIME was off slowly and lacked a rally. BOSSY BOOTS failed to menace. MY

Footnotes
SLIPPIN JIMMY tracked the leaders for the first three-eighths, circled three wide while rallying to the top of the lane, engaged the leader inside the final
sixteenth and cleared late in a determined drive. INDEFATIGABLE stalked the pace through the turn, took command at the top of the lane and finished well
while unable to hold off the winner. BOURBON AND ICE leapt as the gates opened and stumbled when returning to the ground and bumped by rival to have
a very rough start, gathered together, saved ground along the rail and showed good late interest. JUPITER BLUES prompted the pace from the rail in the
early going saving ground and lacked a response when called upon. BOONDOGGLE unhurried early to be near the back of the pack, circled in the turn with
a rally and made a mild gain down the stretch. I'M MONEY sped to the front shortly from the gate and weakened in the lane. FROSTED ARMOUR never
menaced as a non-threat. ELEVATED FOREVER flashed brief speed for a quarter and faded in the turn.

Footnotes
JOLLY BY GOLLY was allowed to settle early on the inside, advanced on the turn while saving ground, came off the turn and tipped two wide, then switched
back to the inside and slipped through by the furlong marker and edged away to prove best under a drive. HOLEY MOLEY was well placed on the inside,
made a inside bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then battled between rivals by the furlong marker, could not go with the winner late, while staying on
gamely for the place award. KING COVEE was reserved early, two wide entering the turn, shifted out and made a four wide move on the far turn, loomed
boldly off the turn but hung late. HERE'S LIAM chased the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and had no kick. CAESAR'S GHOST was
allowed to settle early and lacked a serious rally. ELFUEGOMASBRILANTE was reserved early, inside on the turn and had no late rally. KICKS LIKE
TUCKER was settled back early, four wide on the far turn and was not a threat. CHEATIN SONG was off slowly and was not a factor. OCCASIONAL MOON
was reluctant to load, tracked the pace three wide and tired. BAYTOWN BEAVER set the pace while in the two path and gave way after six furlongs.
