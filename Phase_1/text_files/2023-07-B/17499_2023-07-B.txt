Footnotes
CARSON'S RUN coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside through the first turn before giving chased just off the inside, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in head to head with the runner up and
gamely prevail by a neck on the wire. MOONLIGHT two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled four wide into upper
stretch, rallied in tandem with the aforementioned for to take narrow and brief command a furlong out, dug in dueling to the finish with that foe but was
ultimately bested at the end. FRONTLINE WARRIOR tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide
into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. MODICA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set
down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was overwhelmed by a trio a furlong out, then weakened to the finish.
SHAMROCK SHAKE coaxed from the start, grew rank between foes shortly after the start and began losing action striding greenly while being corrected by
the rider conceding four to five lengths of ground, chased just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing near the three-eighths, swung three
wide into upper stretch and passed tired foes while unable to make an impact. YAQUI VALLEY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest
aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired. CORRUPTION came under coaxing at the start following
a small stutter step, chased along the inside with the majority of the field through the first turn and into the backstretch, began to lose ground and bobbled
slightly five furlongs from home, backed away to pair up with SHAMROCK SHAKE into the far turn, came under light coaxing midway, cornered just off the
inside into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
SCOCCIATORE tracked just behind the leader while inside of a foe, dropped from the three path to the rail early on the turn, was asked with three furlongs
to run, gained in the two path into upper stretch then made a bid outside of the pacesetter, took the advantage just inside the furlong marker, responded well
into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. HIGH OAK settled well back under some urging, saved ground on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under the crop, gained in the two path into the final furlong and finished with good energy to just get up for the place. SAFFA'S DAY was hustled to the front
then angled in, showed the way down the backstretch, lugged out a bit into the turn then dropped from the two path to the rail, was asked for his best in
upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner just inside the furlong marker and was oufinished then lost the place near the finish but earned the show.
OSBOURNE was urged along towards the rear, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path, was driven four wide into the
stretch then quickly angled further out, remained on his inside lead while gaining in the final furlong, swapped to the proper lead inside the sixteenth-pole
and improved for the last spot in the superfecta. MY HARBORS DREAM was urged along off the pace, dropped from the five path to the three path early on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch, chased the vanguard in the drive and lacked the needed kick. FLOKI'S FLIGHT was sent hard from the gate,
chased the pace on the outside, made a bid near the half-mile pole, moved from the four path to the two path early on the turn, dropped back under a drive
into upper stretch and tired. BOLD JOURNEY was last to commence then hustled, moved to the outside near the five-eighths pole, dropped in late on the
backstretch, was urged three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then was carried out, remained on his inside lead to near the eighth-pole then
swapped to the proper lead, drifted in shortly thereafter and lacked the needed response. JOEY FRESHWATER was rated off the pace under a tight hold,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, was let out while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn then roused five wide into the stretch, chased
past the three-sixteenths, swapped back to his inside lead at the furlong marker and faltered then was not urged while protected late.

Footnotes
VOLKERT just off the pace just off the inside in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and angled out four to five wide into upper stretch, rallied
in tandem with LUNA WARRIOR and seized command from that rival just inside the eighth pole when brushing with that foe, then dug in gamely to fend off
the challenge of that rival kept to task to the finish. LUNA WARRIOR broke a beat slow without incident and lost his lane to HATCH, chased three to four
wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, got set down angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, got collared when
brushing with the aforementioned foe inside that station, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed to the wire.
STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on to secure the show honors. WAR TERMINATOR coaxed from the gate, chased three wide coming under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND hustled from the gate, pressed the
pace of KBCYA LATER from between foes in the two path, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in heads
apart for command with three-sixteenths to go, then weakened in the late stages. HATCH chased along the inside, briefly floated to the two path before
tucking back inside placed to coxing near the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. ISOCLINE broke a
half a beat slow, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, passed tired rivals. CARPE'S DREAM coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, weakened in the late going. EL CONEJITO prompted the pace three wide outside the top pair, came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to
go, swung five wide into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off and weakened in the drive. KBCYA LATER hustled from the start, cut the pace along
the inside under pressure from a pair coming under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, spun just off the inside into upper stretch under threat and
yielded inside three-sixteenths to go, then weakened to the finish. BASIS RISK brushed the near side stall at the start, chased three wide under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and offered no kick. EXCESS DEMAND chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went
four to five wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact.

Footnotes
CORNER KICK was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, took over into upper stretch
then kicked clear and drew away under strong urging to prove much the best. PARTY AT GRANTS bumped with a rival after the start then was taken up,
raced towards the rear under coaxing, traveled around most of the turn in the two path, angled four wide outside the quarterr-pole then came six wide into
the stretch, passed foes into the final furlong, drifted in late and finished with good energy to just get up for the place. BEST COAST angled in early while
hustled, moved to the front then set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat near the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage to the winner into upper stretch and proved no match then was denied the place near the wire but was clear for the show. SOUPER TROPICAL
was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while carried in late.
CHEROKEE COTTAGE unseated her rider near the paddock path and ran loose for about three-sixteenths of a mile before being apprehended by an
outrider, was deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, departed the gate under urging, was ridden along on the outside, went four then three wide on the
turn and came up empty. RATIFIED pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, chased in the two path through the turn and tired. KEEP IT SEXY was
urged along off the pace, went around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the rail and failed to threaten. SOUPER SLEWS CASH was well
placed just off the pace, chased two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and capitulated. GRACEFUL was brushed in the
hindquarters after the start, raced off the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MOONEY
MOONEY was hustled from the start while moving in, chased the pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground for most of the turn then
moved to the two path and had nothing left. DRAMATIC EFFECT was last to commence then bumped with a rival after the start and in a bit tight, angled out
at the rear of the field, was hard ridden well out in the track while a bit green, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and showed little.

Footnotes
OVERACTING was reluctant to load, came away in front then angled in while going to the lead, went around the first turn in the two path, opened up a
sizable advantage on the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was shaken up while still clear in upper stretch, swapped back to her
inside lead after being put to a left-handed crop nearing the sixteenth-pole and held determinedly to prevail. STARTS NOW was restless in the gate, saved
ground on the first turn, settled in the front half of the field, was urged along while inside on the far turn, gained three wide into the stretch under a drive,
pursued the winner outside into the final furlong and missed while flattening out some but earned the place. LADY LAOBAN was reluctant to load, dropped
in while showing early speed, moved from the rail to the three path on the first turn, settled towards the front, was urged along in the two path on the far turn
then gained four wide into the stretch, chased the top two in the drive and finished willingly for the show. AUTUMN rounded the opening bend in the three
path, settled on the outside without the benefit of cover, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, gained into upper stretch, chased to the finish and
just missed the show. THE SPLENDID ONE became rank along the rail on the first turn, was reserved off the pace, moved from the rail to the three path
under urging on the final turn, was drive five wide into the stretch, held a reasonable striking position into the final furlong but lacked the needed response.
NORTH END LADY hit the inside of the gate at the start, traveled four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the
far turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SAIL WITH THE WIND was uneasy in the gate then broke a bit slow, bumped repeatedly with
foes nearing the first turn then checked sharply, raced near the back under reserve in the two path, was urged on the far turn and never reached contention.
BOMB SQUAD swerved out to avoid the bumping skirmish to her inside nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled off the pace, moved from
three to five wide under urging on the far turn and failed to threaten. SHE'S A NATURAL broke near the back of the field, swerved out to avoid troubled
horses approaching the opening bend, went three to four wide on the turns and failed to impact. SPLASHY traveled around the first turn in the two path,
settled off the pace, was urged in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond. SHINE MY TIARA bumped hard with a rival nearing the first turn then
checked, saved ground on that bend, settled towards the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor. BENEVOLENTLY hit the inside of
the gate soundly and was off a bit slow, bumped repeatedly with a rival nearing the first turn then was taken up, tugged hard on the bit while rank in the two
path around the opening bend, continued to pull hard on the bit early on the backstretch, brushed the rail late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the
two path on the final turn and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
SEIZE THE GREY broke in at the start and was corrected, established the front shortly after and dueled with LAMBO to his outside, shook briefly away from
that rival near the turn before being engaged in head to head combat once more with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and
swung three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in holding well and clear to the finish kept to task. DORNOCH got
bumped after the start in a chain of bumps begun by DRUM ROLL PLEASE, crossed to the inside forcing a pair of rivals in HOULTON and DIVINE EMPIRE
to steady when shying from the tuck, advanced inside to be just off the duel, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper
stretch and dug in under a drive running on to chase the winner home willingly to secure the place honors. GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE crossed to the two path
soon after the start and chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick. PRIVATE DESIRE lunged at the break, then got bumped by DRUM ROLL PLEASE into DORNOCH who in turn bumped HOULTON, chased just off
the inside just off the duel up front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. LAMBO dueled
three wide with SEIZE THE GREY to his inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. DRUM ROLL PLEASE broke in at the start bumping PRIVATE DESIRE and commencing a chain of bumps in through to HOULTON, chased inside
briefly before tipping two then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no rally.
HOULTON got bumped at the start in a chain of bumps, raced just off the inside, then got forced to steady when shying in tandem with DIVINE EMPIRE as
DORNOCH tucked in front from the outside, tipped out to chase three to four wide from that point on, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went
eight wide into upper stretch and tired. DIVINE EMPIRE shied in at the start from SEIZE THE GREY breaking inwards from the outside and got corrected,
raced along the rail early on and shied skipping along the fence when DORNOCH tucked in front and was steadied at the three-quarter pole, chased along
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went three to four wide for home and made no impact. SKIP THE LINE four
wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND chased four then
three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired.

Footnotes
ELITE POWER settled between foes under coaxing, dropped back outside the nine-sixteenths, started the turn in the two path, was roused while angling
three then four wide later on that bend, gained outside into upper stretch, switched to the proper lead while put to a left-handed crop inside the
three-sixteenths, pursued the runner-up under a continued left-handed crop into the final furlong, made a bid approaching the sixteenth-pole and got up in
the final strides to prevail. GUNITE chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two to three path on the turn,
gained the lead inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear under a left-handed crop into upper stretch, switched to a right-handed crop while remaining on his
inside lead outside the furlong marker, was pulled in by the rider to elicit a lead change outside the sixteenth-pole and made that change, led desperately
under attack from the winner into the final sixteenth, fought under a brisk hand-ride late and was denied while well clear for the place. DEAN DELIVERS
came away in good order, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside of a foe while along the rail on the turn, lost
the advantage inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and weakened but was well clear for
the show. GUN IT raced just off the pace, was taken in hand outside the half-mile pole, dropped back and lost position significantly into the turn, saved
ground while put to urging on that bend, moved out while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, drifted about in the final furlong and just earned the
last spot in the superfecta. SYNTHESIS brushed with a rival while last to commence, settled at the rear, moved out some leaving the backstretch, was
urged along in the three path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. AWESOME AARON brushed with a foe at the start, chased
the pace between horses, went two then three wide on the turn and came up empty. LITTLE VIC tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back under
urging while three then four wide on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and faltered.

TOUGH STREET chased three then four wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path into the far turn briefly before tipping back out four wide with
seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to issue a challenge
through the final furlong, seized command seventy yards from the finish and prevailed kept to task. MARIAH'S APPEAL bobbled and then bumped at the
start with NEW GINYA and pinched that foe back when taking pressure from DIAMOND HANDS inside and ABSINTHE outside, established the front and
showed the way rated along the inside, came under some pressure from ABSINTHE to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the
inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting guided out four paths to see the oncoming TOUGH STREET, got collared seventy yards from the
finish and was along clear for the place honors. SHE CAUGHT MY EYE three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into
upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. ABSINTHE prompted the pace from the outside in the two path, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. NEW GINYA bobbled at the break, then got bumped between foes
and was pinched back, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and made no headway.
DIAMOND HANDS broke out at the start bumping NEW GINYA and pinching that foe back against pressure outside, chased along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, tipped to the two path straightened away and weakened.

Footnotes
FORTE came away in good order, dropped just off the pace on the initial straightaway, moved from the two path to the rail going around the first turn, was
rated just off the pace, drafted inside while in the pocket behind the pacesetter on the far turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came out and bumped
ANGEL OF EMPIRE multiple times to create room into upper stretch, bumped again with that foe while turned out and given one pop of a left-handed crop
inside the three-sixteenths then was carried out by the pacesetter, switched to a right-handed crop while gaining between foes inside the furlong marker,
drifted in while getting to the runner-up late and got up to narrowly prevail. SAUDI CROWN moved in while coaxed to the front, saved ground on the first
turn, was well rated while setting the pace, raced inside on the far turn, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, drifted out significantly inside the
three-sixteenths, maintained a short lead under a right-handed crop while under attack into the final furlong, took a straighter course while in front into the
final sixteenth, was carried in late and denied while able to get the place. ANGEL OF EMPIRE went three then two wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on
the outside, was asked at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased in the two path on the far turn, was bumped multiple times by FORTE and nudged out into
upper stretch, bumped again with that foe while carried out outside the furlong marker then came under a right-handed crop, fought outside of the top two
into the final furlong, drifted in some late and missed but was clear for the show. DISARM was hustled from the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled
under some urging, came under stronger encouragement late on the backstretch, traveled around the far turn in the two path while ridden along, was put to
the crop near the five-sixteenths, angled out behind the vanguard in upper stretch then moved out further coming to the furlong marker, chased the top three
on the outside to the finish and lacked the needed kick. HIT SHOW hit the outside of the gate and was off a bit slow, went three wide on the first turn, settled
on the outside under coaxing, was roused for more outside the half-mile pole, chased three wide on the far turn then was driven four wide into the stretch,
drifted out near the three-sixteenths then was carried out, chased outside into the final furlong and capitulated. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY

Footnotes
QUEENS DANCER established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand along the inside under pressure from BUNTY WINDEMERE to the
outside, remained patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, shook off the prompter nearing the eighth pole confronted to
the inside, dug in dueling through to the finish in game fashion and repelled the challenge to inch away at the end to prevail. SANDY'S GARDEN chased
three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, rallied up the rail to engage the leader in head to head
combat through the final furlong fighting on game but was ultimately rebuffed and denied at the end. SIKUM grew a bit fractious in the gate when
SARATOGA CHROME needed adjusting, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild kick to latch on the runner up as she hit the finish. I'M NERVOUS NOW chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid.
SARATOGA CHROME broke out at the start bumping KERRY, chased three to four wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path at the half
mile pole when placed to coaxing, swung three wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the finish. KERRY got bumped at the start by the
aforementioned foe, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BUNTY
WINDERMERE pressed the pace of QUEENS DANCER from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to
four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SUMMER AT THE SPA bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into
the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
CALLIE'S GRIT went to the front, showed the way while well rated in the two path, was given her cue in the three path into the stretch, responded well into
the final furlong, drifted out outside the sixteenth-pole and held sway under steady urging. SHE'S MO BUBBLY stalked the pace on the outside in the three
path, chased on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong, kept on into the final sixteenth, gained on the
aforementioned foe late but missed while clear for the place. TAWARET was taken in hand while off heels after the start, raced under restraint into the first
turn, saved ground while rated off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, chased on the far turn, moved to the two path outside the
quarter-pole and lacked the needed response while along for the show. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under
urging with a half-mile to run, chased inside on the far turn and lacked the needed kick. FIZZY broke out and hit the gate then bumped with a foe, went three
wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, dropped from the three path to the rail on the far turn and failed to rally. MACHIAVELLIQUE was restless in the
gate, traveled two to three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and came up empty. DUKE GIRLS was
bumped at the start, tracked the pace on the outside in the four path, was roused nearing the half-mile pole, chased four wide on the far turn and tired. BEL
ROSSO was caught five wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused near the nine-sixteenths, raced four wide on the far turn and failed to
respond.
