Footnotes
SPEEDY JOHNY was unhurried to trail the field outside at the half, circled four wide around horses with three furlongs from the finish, loomed the threat six
wide straightening out for the drive and wore down the leader through the stretch to edge away late while not switching leads to the finish. T'PRING was
content to track the leader outside in the early going, started to reel in the loose frontrunner midway on the turn, assumed command at the furlong marker
but could not find more to hold off the winner in deep stretch. ONANDONANDON broke in at the start, tracked the quick pacesetter in the second flight with
horses on either side with five eighths left to run, was in tight between foes at the quarter pole, pushed her way through turning for home and ran on willingly
through the stretch capturing third money. SANDY GRACE was allowed to settle seeing most of the field down the backside, started to gain momentum
picking up rivals inside with three eighths to go, moved out seven wide for the drive and showed good late energy to the wire to get up for a minor role in the
end. WHISPER ME A SONG hopped at the break, stalked near the rear three wide with a half mile remaining, put in a brief rally until the quarter pole and
stalled in mid stretch. GENTLE SEAS travelled in the middle of the pack on the rail early on, offered a mild turn of foot on the rail advancing on the turn and
was one paced running to the wire down the stretch. MOET MONET was hustle to the front, opened up on challengers down the back straight, began to
shorten stride with a quarter left to run and stopped in mid stretch. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY tracked the loose frontrunner inside at the half, was urged for
more run on the rail midway on the turn and was empty in the four path in upper stretch. RUSHING THE SKY settled in midfield three wide outside runners
down the backside, was roused between rivals into the turn, offered little response and was not a factor in the drive to the wire. FANG MEIN LIED stalked in
midpack between runners down the backstretch, was asked for more run with three eighths to go, could not keep up with horses through the turn and was
not involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ANITA MARGARITA got away well, settled in behind the leader as that one moved clear, stalked from outside that foe three wide, edged closer willingly on
the far turn, was put to urging in upper stretch, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and edged past. MONEY BEETS was keen to go to the fore early,
moved clear and shifted in to about the two path to set the pace under light rating tactics, edged away from rivals past the seven-sixteenths, had one rival
edging nearer from outside in pursuit, put to urging when that rival was alongside in upper stretch, overtaken by the sixteenth pole and outkicked. THE
ARCHANGEL settled outside at the back four deep, was encouraged coming to the seven-sixteenths, began to slowly edge closer going four then five wide
on the far turn and into the stretch, kept on for show honors. PLAYMATE stalked from outside three to four wide early, began losing ground into and on the
far turn, shifted in a path in upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick and ran on evenly. BLACKDIAMOND DINNY was in a bit tight early between runners
heading into the first turn three wide, continued racing at the back while settled, went three wide on the far turn and ran on. BEYOND REASON was under a
hold into the first turn racing inside foes but off the fence and in behind, failed to rally once clear. YORKSHIRE was rank early racing inside and in behind
others through the first turn, continued on or just off the rail in behind still a bit hard to control, lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
BLUEBERRY FIELDS was nestled on the rail behind the pace on the first turn, rated comfortably on the fence down the backstretch, was urged for more
moving outside off the rail at the three furlong marker, found another gear turning for home when inside rival was quickening between foes to bid for the
front and got up late when urged right handed nearing the wire. BEQUIA broke inwards bumping fellow rival at the break, kept a close eye on the frontrunner
in the first turn, was content watching the pacesetter down the back straight, pounced to the lead outside at the quarter marker and determinedly ran to the
wire but was just outfinished by the winner in deep stretch. ROYAL BLUSH stalked near the back inside in the beginning, waited on the fence behind rivals
four furlongs from the wire, advanced smartly on the rail at the three furlong pole, continued a strong rally between horses bidding three wide at the top of
the lane but could not threaten the top two in the end and settled for a clear third at the wire. DIOSA CATRINA broke out bumping foe to start, recovered to
lead into the first turn, dictated a reasonable pace down the back straight, was collared outside midway on the final turn, battled inside until the top of the
stretch and faded on the rail at the furlong marker to settle for a small share. SWEET NOLA was unhurried three wide outside near the back in the early
going, settled outside runners three deep down the backside, could not find more more when roused three eighths from home and gave way on the far turn.
FOXY DIVA was off a step slow to begin, trailing into the first turn, could still see the field stalking between foes down the backstretch, offered a mild run
three furlongs from the finish and could not make any impact through the stretch. TRICK AND TREAT tracked between horses in the two path going into the
first turn, was on hold in midpack with horses on either side at the half, lost position trying to go with the winner at the three eighths pole and retreated inside
in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AHA MOMENT was coaxed forward from the start, took the lead and cleared entering the first turn shifting in at that juncture, set the pace up the
backstretch while slowing it down a bit, was prompted and headed briefly at the four- and one-half, regained command, drew clear in the stretch, was given
just moderate encouragement to the wire. GAYELETTE tracked from inside in behind the pace, came off the rail at the quarter pole, moved through a seam
at the top of the stretch, had aim on the leader, could not match strides while drifting out under left-handed encouragement. AMAZIN QUEEN was reserved
at the rear saving ground, fanned five wide leaving the far turn, ran along for show. KITTEN'S ROMANCE got away well, settled off the leaders two to three
wide, steadied slightly and altered outside foes four deep past the seven-sixteenths, advanced on the leader through the second turn, flattened out for the
drive. BIZYMALINE switched outside the leader early on the first turn, stalked that one three deep, edged closer to press up the backstretch prompting and
putting a short head narrowly in front at the four- and one-half, came up empty. LADY MAEVE (IRE) broke awkwardly and slowly, was coaxed forward
outside to gain better contact with the leaders, stalked those up the backstretch, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
CHASING BOURBON broke with the field but was slow to get into stride three deep outside horses in the early going, made a smart move saving ground
shifting inside at the three furlong marker gaining on the leaders, rallied up the fence two furlongs out to be the main threat when turning for home and was
closing with every stride late to just get up to share the win at the wire. VANDOO was hustled clearing the field to lead on the rail down the back straight,
opened up on the chasing challengers through the turn, braced for the closers in upper stretch and stubbornly dug in to share the win at the finish. MEKO
MAKEE tossed his head at the break to trail down the backstretch, rallied smartly around rivals three wide at the three eighths marker, was in with a chance
in the five path straightening out for the drive and stubbornly chased in the stretch to the wire but could not overcome the slow start to threaten the top two
at the finish. CALL FOR LOCATES settled in midpack between horses at the half, was unable to keep inside position entering the turn to be shuffled back
inside and showed late interest in deep stretch to be involved for the minors in the end. CONTRIVANCE broke out at the start bumping fellow rival,
recovered to track outside three deep down the backside, was in the mix up front prompting three wide outside midpoint on the turn, could not make
anymore headway by the quarter pole and finished up evenly to the wire. RED SNEAKERS tracked the frontrunner two deep down the backside, took closer
order between horses with seven sixteenths to run to be in the mix for the lead, needed more when trying to stay involved at the quarter pole and faded at
the furlong marker. OH PEANUTS broke in bumping foe to begin, settled near the rear on the rail at the half, could not keep up with others throughout the
turn when urged and was not a presence in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
FOURFIFTYFOUR pressed inside the early leader but off the fence under a tight hold, settled down and eased back off the leading pair passing the
seven-sixteenths, stalked in behind through the turn, found room inside at the top of the stretch, bid and took the lead just past the furlong marker, was just
clear and held off a rallying challenger under continued urging. WAR PAINTER was urged at the break, got forward position stalking in behind the leaders
about mid-pack, moved out from three to six wide on the turn fanning outside runners to be seven to eight deep in upper stretch and having gained to within
striking distance, drifted a bit in the lane, surged late under stout urging but missed. HURRICANE CLAIR broke a step slowly then veered out several paths
at the start, moved forward outside to get within range of the leaders going four to five wide on the turn, came out a bit in the stretch and kept on late for
show. TWISTING PISTONS raced off the pace near the rail, was about mid-pack into the turn, came out a bit at the quarter pole but then cut back to the rail
as a rival in front blocked the path, improved position inside. EMERANCE was ridden strongly at the start, chased from between runners, moved to the rail
on the turn, came back off the rail passing the quarter pole, entered upper stretch four deep and under an all out drive, was guided back to the two path in
upper- to mid-stretch and ran on but lacked the needed late kick. CHARLOTTES ROAD broke a step slowly, switched off the inside and made rapid
advance between runners up the backstretch to regain contact with the main body of the field, saved ground near the rail through the turn, waited on heels
briefly at the quarter pole, came out a bit at that juncture, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and finished up to pass horses willingly. STOLEN
VALOUR moved to the fore to set the pace, faced pressure inside and out racing well off the rail, went in the three path on the turn with just outside
prompted, weakened in the stretch. OLIVIA ROSE broke alertly, pressed the pace from outside four wide through the turn and under encouragement past
the five-sixteenths, weakened in the stretch. THAT GIRL ARTEMUS raced outside in the back half of the field, went three to four wide on the turn and ran on
evenly. MORE MONEY HUNNY tapped on the brakes racing in behind a runner early, continued inside before coming off the rail on the turn, failed to
menace. CAMAROSA was fractious in the gate, broke in the air spotting the field numerous lengths, raced off the inside and was not a factor. VICTORIOUS
NYQUIST lacked early speed racing off the inside, was never a threat.

Footnotes
SILVER MAGNATIZED was nestled on the rail behind the early speed, pulled the rider to the lead between horses at the half, opened up when nudged on
for more midpoint on the far turn and had more left in reserve when roused mildly in mid stretch to comfortably hold safe at the wire. TAQUANYAH travelled
three wide close to the back in the early going while in hand, rated kindly watching the top three at the half, was shuffled back on the fence behind a tiring
early leader with three eighths left to run, shifted just outside to rally between rivals at the quarter pole and gamely tried to reel in the winner down the
stretch but could not pose a threat crossing the line. MAKE NO MISTAKE tracked two wide in the first turn, had a good position outside watching the top pair
down the backstretch, could not go with the winner at the half mile marker, chased in vain on the final turn and faded at the furlong marker losing the place
share in deep stretch. UMNEYAAT stalked four wide outside going into the first turn, travelled outside in midpack three deep down the back straight, was
roused going three wide around horses on the final turn to be in the hunt for a share at the top of the lane and levelled off in mid stretch to settle for a minor
role. SPEEDY LYNN trailed the field in the two path to begin, continued unhurried seeing the compact field down the backside, offered a mild run three wide
outside on the far turn but could only pass the tiring early frontrunner in the the late stages of the race. PLUS POWER took command from the start to lead
this field into the first turn, was headed by the winner outside midway down the backside, offered no resistance and backed away through the field on the far
turn.

Footnotes
TYSON quickly moved to the lead and clear and shifted in but off the rail dictating terms, was under a very tight hold on the first turn and early up the
backstretch, faced outside pressure midway up that straight, was challenged through the far bend, asked for more at the top of the stretch, turned back that
rival in mid-stretch and edged away. CARROTHERS moved forward pulling against the riders restraint three to four wide leaving the first turn and early up
the backstretch to press then prompt the eventual winner, dueled outside that one trading noses for the lead from the half to the quarter pole, yielded in
mid-stretch but held the place. ARTIE'S STORM settled into stride off the pace, raced between foes up the backstretch in the second flight, put to stout
urging by the five-sixteenths still between runners, came out four to five wide for the stretch run, kicked on but missed second. CLEAR DESTINATION
tracked from inside foes in the second group, asked for more by the five-sixteenths, was guided out four wide for the stretch run, kept on evenly. KINGMAX
(IRE) settled outside runners off the leading pair three to four wide, came out a bit for the drive after being put to urging by the midpoint of the far turn,
needed more in the stretch. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was outpaced early, trailed and given some minor encouragement up the backstretch, swung six
wide into the stretch, ran on mildly late.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S BIT had a good spot tracking the top two in the first turn outside, forced the issue outside the pacesetters flank in the early part of the running down
the backside, assumed command with five sixteenths to go and with a couple of taps right handed in mid stretch kept clear comfortably at the finish line.
WHIMSICAL DANCE hopped at the start, settled nicely on the rail behind the top three down the backside, moved out three wide at the three furlong
marker, loomed the only threat in the four path straightening out for the drive, could not gain on the winner through the stretch and just held for the place
share at the wire. TOERIS travelled just outside between foes near the back in the beginning, was on hold briefly with rivals on either side at the three
eighths marker, rallied in the two path in upper stretch and was closing in for the place but just missed getting up at the wire. MY GIRL SKY travelled near
the rear three deep on the first turn and down the backstretch, rallied four wide midway on the far turn, swung six wide for the drive to be in with a chance for
a piece of the prize and got up in the last jump for a small share. GIZALA (IRE) took this field on the rail into the first turn, had a narrow lead while hounded
by the winner down the backside, was headed outside midway on the far turn, battled inside at the top of the lane and yielded at the furlong marker.
BUTTERED TOAST was allowed to settle trailing the field in the early stages of the race, shifted outside horses midpoint on the turn, could not reach
contention through the lane and passed a weary foes at the eighth pole. BIONICA prompted two wide outside in the first turn, was taken back entering the
backstretch to track outside in the second flight, offered a brief run when roused three furlongs from the finish outside rivals but weakened in the five path in
the drive to the wire.

Footnotes
MUSKOKA GIANT was well-positioned stalking from the second flight, went four wide on the turn and was ridden along three furlongs out, put to more stout
urging by the top of the stretch and with momentum, was carried out a bit in mid- and again in late-stretch, lightly brushed late and just got up. TRIGGER'S
BAY moved forward inside to take the lead soon after the start, was pressured up the backstretch, moved clear coming past the three-eighths, extended the
margin into upper stretch, began to shorten stride and drifted out under left-handed encouragement in mid-stretch then again late brushing a rival in the
process and just failed to last. ANSELMO was outsprinted early, raced in behind runners of the second flight, moved out from four to six wide gradually on
the turn while under pressure, swung out eight wide for the drive, ran on to secure show honors. IT WORKED broke a step slowly then settled into stride at
the back, went three wide on the turn, was guided six wide in upper stretch, had room to run on, drifted in through middle and late stretch and finished up
willingly. COLLABORATIVE stalked from between foes in the second flight, went three to four wide on the turn coming five wide into upper stretch, was
carried in a bit in late stretch and ran on but needed more. STRONGER TOGETHER moved forward up the backstretch outside runners, went five then six
wide on the turn and seven wide into upper stretch, needed more. NIKKI NOOTS broke a step slowly, lacked early speed, switched out racing off the inside,
swung nine deep into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. QUIET SPEED broke well but soon dropped back lacking early speed while shifting in, saved
ground on or just off the rail, ran on evenly. HIP TO YOUR TRICKS was lightly bumped at the break, moved forward tracking in behind the pace inside the
second flight, faded. MOONQUEST got away well, prompted the pace from outside up the backstretch, began to drop back entering the turn, came up tired
but was not persevered with in the final furlong. ETHNIC SOUL bobbled inwards into a rival at the start, had forward position stalking from between runners
in the second flight, retreated beginning midway on the turn.
