Footnotes
MY ADDICTION tracked the pace four wide, steadily gained outside, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. COME DREAM WITH ME
stalked the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole but was unable to match strides with the winner late. LIGHTING CLOUDS set a
clear pace in the two path and weakened in the final sixteenth. HUNCA MUNCA went evenly inside. PESKY chased the pace from the rail and lacked the
needed rally. KINGY failed to menace while racing three wide. GO TINTIN GO played no factor while racing four wide.

ARAK set the pace in the two path, was cued right handed when challenged by an outer rival turning into the stretch, briefly lost the lead while dueling with
that foe passing the eighth pole, but dug in and fought on gamely to get back up in the final strides. ONE FAST DREAM raced prominently while up close
under a hold from the three path, bid under a drive turning into the lane, stayed on and stuck a head in front of the inner pacesetter while dueling passing
the eighth pole, but was repelled to place. CACCIATORE tracked in the four path and was coaxed along into the far turn, tipped out to the five path turning
into the stretch and finished evenly for show. RIGHT KARMA raced off the pace in the three path, was cued from the four path into the far turn, urged while
swinging out to the six path into the lane, but was one paced. SUNSHINE FROLIC rated in the five path, floated out around the turn and was in the eight
path entering the stretch, angled inwards and made no impact. LYTE CRUDE stalked in the two path but faded along the inside turning into the lane.

COUNTLESS DREAMS pressed the pace in the three path, drew clear nearing the quarter pole and widened under a drive in the lane. INDIA PILAGA
(ARG) stalked the pace from the rail, was in a bit tight near the quarter pole, had a clear path at the rail throughout the stretch run and was clearly second
best. VACATION SUITE raced off the early pace, advanced four wide around the turn, was forced out turning for home, could not gain on the winner in the
lane and was geared down late. HOLLYWOOD HONEY saved ground and failed to menace. DELTA RED set the pace in the two path, drifted out leaving
the quarter pole, was clipped behind and retreated. SHE KNOWS IT ALL was off slow and outrun while racing five wide. LAW MACHINE raced in range
three wide between foes, clipped heels nearing the three-sixteenths pole, fell, quickly regained her feet and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN
INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND DISQUALIFIED DELTA RED FROM FIFTH TO LAST FOR
INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
SEA PEARL set the pace in the three path, tipped to the two path into the turn, opened up while floating out to the four path turning into the lane, and held
clear under a drive. STARSHIP VANITY prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, floated out to the six path in upper
stretch, and chased on to secure place. ROMASHKA rated along the rail, slipped through an opening while cutting the corner under a drive into the stretch,
and finished evenly for show. ALWAYS CONNECTED was hustled in range around the five path, lost ground going into the turn, fanned out to the eight path
turning into the lane, and was one paced. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased out in the seven path and bumped with an
inner foe into the turn, but made no impact from the six path down the lane. AMOR VICTORIOUS broke out and brushed with an outer foe at the start,
tracked between foes in the six path, bumped with an outer foe again into the turn, and faded between turning into the stretch. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT got rank
as the gates opened, hopped at the start, and always trailed around the two path.

Footnotes
ANOTHERDAYGONEBY set the pace in the two path, drew clear from the pace rivals near the quarter pole, was headed by a rail-rallying MISS UCRANIA
in midstretch, was lightly bumped by that foe near the sixteenth pole, dueled outside to the wire and narrowly prevailed. MISS UCRANIA saved ground off
the pace, closed at the rail in upper stretch, took the lead nearing the eighth pole, drifted out and lightly bumped the winner near the sixteenth pole, dueled
inside of that foe to the wire and just missed. FIND YOUR PASSION dueled three wide down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn,
could not keep pace with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on for the show. BLACK ICE raced in range four wide and weakened in the lane.
TROTTING GEAR dueled between foes while the rider frequently reached forward in an apparent attempt to adjust equipment then faded after a half.
YLANG YLANG failed to menace while racing four wide. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT NEAR THE SIXTEENTH
POLE AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

HOLIDAY FANTASY pressed in the four path, bid between under urging passing the quarter and tipped out to the five path into the lane, stayed on between
to take a short lead nearing the sixteenth pole, and inched away. GREEN MILLENNIUM was unhurried in the six path early, advanced down the

CARSOWN brushed with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two path, was coaxed while tipping inside into the far turn, was confronted by an outer
pair while shifting back out to the two path turning into the stretch, kept on into the final furlong, but faded late to show. SKY KATZ bumped with an inner foe
at the start, was held up in the five path early and finished evenly in the stretch. DONTKISSDAMINISTER bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked
between foes in the three path, was ridden between foes around the far turn, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, but made no impact.

Footnotes
PEACH NECTAR set a clear pace in the four path, was in three path rounding the turn, extended his advantage from the five path into the lane, and was
wrapped up late. ANTHONY'S ROCKET chased in the three path, was coaxed from the four path early around the turn, angled inwards into the stretch, and
kept on for place. PARTNER TOURS bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated along the rail, advanced from said position under rousing around the turn,
shifted out around the four path into the stretch, but evened out to show. MOTOWN PUNK bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the two path but
made no impact from the five path down the lane. ALWAYS GOLDEN hopped at the start, was prompted along in the four path, under a drive when
swinging out to the six path into the stretch, but faded. DONTONIO got bumped on both sides at the start and always trailed from the two to four paths.
