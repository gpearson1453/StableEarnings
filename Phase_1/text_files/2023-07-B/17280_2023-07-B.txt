Footnotes
SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW showed her natural speed early as she took the lead for the first few jumps, was challenged by a foe who wanted the lead,, settled
into a stalking position as she rated in hands, launched a bid at the half mile pole, improved position easily, took the lead by the five sixteenth pole, drew off
down the stretch for the win. OUR HALLIE raced in the four path from in the middle of the field, inched closer, launched a bid at the three eighths pole,
gained ground through the turn while still running in the four path, drew next a foe who was chasing the leader, battled with that foe for second, repelled that
one but could not catch the eventual winner, achieving second. CONTEMPO GRAY was off a step slow and last early on, raced on the rail and saved
ground, improved position, up for third. BLUE COWGIRL vied for the lead, raced in the two path, took the led, was joined at the half mile pole, matched
strides with the rival to her outside until the five sixteenth pole where that rival went on, had another rival draw next to her near the quarter pole, battled for
second with that rival, struggled to switch t her right lead, and tired. MALLORI'S MAGIC trailed, improved late. WILD BIZNESS was never involved.
LEXINGTON DIAMOND stalked from the two path , then faltered.

Footnotes
DANZIG UP A STORM vied for the lead, raced on the rail while setting the pace, took control early and went wire to wire determinedly. HAVE I EVER was
off a touch slow, raced on the rail from off of the [ace, was gently steadied in the first turn, settled as she found her stride, saved ground and improved
position, gained ground through the turn, closed willingly,, was coaxed through a hole on the fence to pass rivals getting up for second. SCRAPBOOK
stalked from the two path, rated in hands, maintained bid and was able to out finish the rest. FUHR MEO vied for the lead, briefly led, stalked from the three
path, then gave way. MY ALIBI raced mid pack in the three path, raced in between foes, shifted into the four path and circled the field in the turn, but had no
late kick. CAJUN ACES stalked the pace from the four path on the out side, launched a bid at the three eighth s pole, improved position and was in
contention at the quarter pole but to no avail. TEXAS TIDELANDS was never invovled. HALF SCOUT brief speed. C C'S COWGIRL raced from off the
pace, seven wide, showed llittle. GEE SHE'S PRETTY trailed through out.
