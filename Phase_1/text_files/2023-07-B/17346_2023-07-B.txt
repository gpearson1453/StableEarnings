Footnotes
BIG INVESTMENT took command from the start, was nudged along unchallenged throughout the turn, was finally roused in mid stretch and kept on to hold
safe at the wire. TRICKY MAGICIAN was unhurried near the back in the early stages, made a good move on the rail at the three eighths marker, loomed the
threat in the two path turning for home but could not reel in the front running winner who had something in reserve. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS broke in a
tangle at the start to trail in the beginning, advanced on the rail picking up foes on the turn, slipped up the fence in upper stretch to contend, angled outside
to the three path at the furlong pole and finished up to be a non threaten clear third in the end. SEA SCOUT broke inwards at the start, regrouped to track
the pacesetter between with four furlongs remaining, could not match strides with rivals losing ground to the leaders on the turn and re-rallied on the fence
the final sixteenth to capture a minor share. STORMY SOUL broke in the air to begin, recovered to chase the frontrunner down the backstretch, was ridden
three wide to keep position but to no avail two furlongs from home and retreated between horses through the stretch. WENJACK had a good spot three
deep watching the top pair down the backside, offered a brief run outside foes with three furlongs to go making little gain on the leaders by the quarter
marker and levelled out in the five path in the last eighth. RACING IN THE RAIN was allowed to settle just off the rail at the half near the back, could not get
involved seeing the field on the turn and found little on the fence down the lane to be a factor.

Footnotes
SNOOKERED rated kindly near the back of the pack with four furlongs to the finish, was on hold briefly on the rail when behind a wall of three runners
midpoint on the turn, shifted outside four wide to quickly pass horses at the quarter marker, was full of run at the top of the lane in the five path and closed
with a rush in the final sixteenth while urged left handed to draw away comfortably crossing the wire. SING DIXIE was taken a hold of while in tight between
foes soon after the break, settled near the rear outside three deep down the backside, rallied three wide circling runners commencing at the three furlong
marker, closed in on the lead at the eighth pole but could not match strides with the late surging winner in the final sixteenth and settled for second best on
this day. DIO BRANDO trailed the field down the backstretch, started to pick up rivals three wide between at the quarter pole, offered a good late kick
gaining momentum in upper stretch and closed outside to capture third at the finish. VIDEO VIDA engaged on the rail soon after the start for the front,
emerged the speed of the speed to take command at the half mile marker, opened up on the field turning for home and tired at the seventy yard pole inside
losing positions in deep stretch. IT'S ME MARIO was hustled to try to get the lead outside after the start, chased the pace three deep at the half, hounded
the frontrunner throughout the turn and faded in mid stretch. J M R TUREK broke in brushing inside rival at the start, had a good spot watching the top four
battle in early backstretch, advanced between horses midpoint on the turn and was one paced through the stretch. UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE)
pressed the issue three wide at the start, was reined back off the early speed duel with eleven sixteenths to go, was steadied between runners at the three
furlong marker and was not persevered with at the quarter pole to the wire. MY SONG BABY was part of the early four pronged speed duel early on,
prompted the pace in between foes two wide at the half, gave way with runners on either side at the three furlong marker and stopped at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
STAR REDEMPTION took control throughout the back straight, was headed outside at the two furlong pole,, dueled stubbornly inside turning for home and
began to edge away in the final sixteenth in a gritty performance up front throughout. ROYAL QUALITY prompted outside down the backstretch, applied
more pressure outside to be head and head with the winner at the quarter pole, fought on determinedly in upper stretch, could not find more at the furlong
marker and had to settle for second best at the finish. TOWN'S WARRIOR tracked the frontrunner on the rail down the backside, was roused to go after the
contesting top pair midway on the turn, swung out three deep for the drive to the wire, shifted back inwards to the rail at the eighth pole and was gaining
slowly to finish up a non threatening third in the end. KID MARVELOUS settled in midpack alone at the half, was roused with five sixteenths to go with rivals
on either side, continued to keep pace with others to be in the hunt in lane five at the top of the stretch and finished up evenly to the wire holding for a minor
share in the end. ALPHA MEISTER dwelt at the start spotting the field to begin, recovered by the half to be in contention with the pack inside, rallied three
wide between runners three furlongs to home, was in range six wide outside horses at the top of the stretch but could not sustain his run trying to overcome
the poor start and stalled in the final sixteenth. THE NEW MAYBE was allowed to settle near the back outside down the backstretch, could not keep pace
with others four wide outside horses with three furlongs remaining, could see the field in the four path straightening out for the drive, shifted in to the rail at
the furlong marker but could not make any impression inside to the finish. SPEEDY N SMART was away slowly on the break, was shuffled back when in
tight quarters on the rail entering the turn to trail the field and could not make any impact running on the fence to the wire.

SUNRISE DRIVE was caught five wide into the first turn racing toward the back, eased back off trailing rivals and tucked in a bit thereupon racing just a few
paths off the rail, trailed up the backstretch and was ridden along coming to the half, swung eight deep turning for home, kicked on with a sustained rally to
get the lead seventy yards out and edge clear. SOLAR moved forward under mild early encouragement, pressed from outside just off the leader three to
four deep, bid past the three-eighths drawing even, contended for the lead while drifting five wide into upper stretch, continued to dog it out bumping a rival
in the process, was no match for the winner but got the place. RELIABILITY was coaxed forward but caught four to five wide into and on the first turn,
stalked the leading pair from outside up the backstretch, continued wide on the far turn floating six deep turning for home, bid at the furlong pole putting a
nose in front, was bumped by a rival late and outkicked. DIXIE GIANT got away alertly and went straight to the fore to set the terms racing well off the rail in
the three path into the turn, continued up the backstretch off the inside with outside pressure, was challenged into the far turn, drifted out a bit in the stretch
but fought on. H C HOLIDAY stalked from mid-pack between runners initially going two to three wide on the first turn, moved out a bit on the far turn and into
the stretch, ran on evenly. JACK THE CAT tracked from inside just off and in behind the leaders, came out a bit at the top of the stretch then altered back in
to the two path at the furlong marker with plenty of room if good enough but could only go on evenly late. DESOLATOR settled at the rear shifting in,
advanced a position up the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, needed more. NATIVE PRINCE raced outside foes three to four wide mid-division
through the first turn, came out six wide turning for home, was never far off the lead but unable to threaten.

FORESTER'S TURN broke inwardly, was forced in early up the backstretch as a rival came in while moving to the front, switched outside the leading pair
and stalked in hand mid-division, edged closer willingly three wide on the turn, came out a path or two at the top of the stretch, took aim and struck the lead
just outside the sixteenth pole, drew clear. EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN pressed from outside two to three wide into the turn, took the lead in mid-stretch, was
no match but held the place. UPSTART GENTLEMAN lacked early speed despite some initial encouragement racing outside off the early leaders, went four
then five wide on the turn, swung out seven deep into upper stretch, ran on well but too late. BIG WARDEN was urged forward from the break to make the
lead in the clear and shifted in, faced outside pressure setting the pace, yielded in the stretch. SUPREMEACTION lacked early speed, shifted in and began
to advance inside on the turn moving out three wide coming past the quarter pole, ran on. DR CHAPPELL chased from inside, steadily weakened. TALL
WATER got away slowly and in a bit tight, moved up to regain contact with the field racing off the inside, moved out to the four path leaving the turn, eased
through late stretch, crossed the wire and walked off.

Footnotes
SILENT RESERVE took command soon after the start, extended his lead comfortably on the turn putting away the chasing rival with five sixteenths to go,
opened up when coaxed for more in mid stretch and cruised home alone nearing the wire. GALVASTON tracked on the rail watching the top two at the half
mile marker, took up the running throughout the turn chasing the winner, loomed the only threat on the fence in the stretch run but could not make any gains
to the finish and narrowly held second money from the late closer at the finish. WESTERN TROUBLE trailed the field in the early going, split foes midway on
the turn starting to rally, angled five wide turning for home, found his best stride late, gaining strongly in the final sixteenth and just missed getting up for the
place share in the end. NAPA SPIRIT (IRE) tracked the top two outside three deep at the half, was asked for more three wide making little gain on the
leaders, shifted out to the four path for the drive to be involved for a minor share and finished evenly to the wire just getting caught late losing the show
award at the wire. ABISKO stalked near the rear in the two path down the back straight, made little advancement on the fence through the turn and passed
a tiring runner inside nearing the finish. DISCREET TUNE forced the pace outside down the backstretch, began to weaken chasing the loose winner midway
on the turn, battled briefly for a minor share in upper stretch and gave way between foes running on the wrong lead to the finish, was pulled up after the wire
and was vanned off. DETERMINED FURY settled four deep outside horses in midfield down the backside, could not get interested running outside rivals
through the turn, shifted widest in the six path for the drive and showed little in the run to the finish line.

Footnotes
QUIET OUT EAST was content loping along on a long rein sitting outside the flank of the leader in the beginning, was even with the pacesetter outside at
the three eighths pole, poked his head in front five wide outside straightening out for the drive at the quarter pole, surrendered the lead briefly drifting out
under left handed urged with three sixteenths to go, took back the lead at the furlong marker and held off the new challenger at the wire. KIDDIE HOLIDAY
had a good spot tracking the top duo outside in the beginning, started to reel in the embattled pair with five sixteenths from the wire, continued to close the
gap with each stride at the top of the lane, loomed the threat in the final sixteenth inside and just missed the nod at the wire in the win photo. JUST START
ME UP pulled the rider to the lead setting a soft pace in the early going, was headed outside by the winner three furlongs from the wire, gave way
momentarily at the quarter pole, resurged inside to poke his nose in front with three sixteenths to go, stubbornly battled from the eighth pole to the wire but
gave way grudgingly late and had to settle for third in a hard fought effort. CANADIAN PHAROAH tracked in the second flight on the rail down the backside,
was asked for more run on the rail midway through the turn, had no response, trailed in the two path straightening out for the drive and showed some late
interest to pass tired runners in the final eighth. LION KINGDOM was unhurried on the rail near the back, offered a mild turn of foot to battle between foes at
the three eighths marker, fought on in upper stretch but yielded in the last sixteenth losing a placing late. SAND DANCER took some awkward steps leaving
the gate, losing action to be well behind the pack trailing down the backstretch, was roused entering the turn catching up to the field four wide around horses
with three furlongs remaining, was in with a chance outside for a share of the prize turning for home passing some runners but could not sustain the run and
tired in mid stretch.

Footnotes
WILD CONVERSATION stalked in the middle of the pack two wide at the half, shifted just outside into the turn keeping pace with others, found clear running
room in the fourth lane driving to the wire in upper stretch, began to lengthen stride at the eighth pole and closed strongly outkicking rivals late to draw away
crossing the line for the win. MENTORING was nestled behind the speed on the rail down the backstretch, waited to pounce on the turn rating comfortably
throughout, found a rail seam in mid stretch, rallied up the fence late but was outfinished by the winner nearing the wire. DANCIN' DEPUTY had a good
position tracking the top pair outside at the half mile marker, close in on the leaders when asked midpoint on the turn to battle three deep straightening out
for the drive, continued to dig in fighting for the front at the sixteenth pole but needed a little more late and gave way in deep stretch holding on to the show
award in the end in a gutsy effort. PALACE RING had a slim lead down the back straight, continued to keep his head in front while hounded outside through
the turn, was clinging onto the lead when collared by three rivals outside at the top of the stretch, kept on going until the sixteenth pole and finally gave way
late holding for a minor share in a determined front running attempt. CHUNKY MONKEY was squeezed on the break to be near the back four wide at the
half, was coaxed for more with seven sixteenths to run trying to keep position into the turn, rallied mildly four wide two furlongs from the finish, lost its oath
six wide at the top of the lane and could not recover in time to pose a threat at the wire. SEATTLE POINT settled in midfield five deep down the backstretch,
put in an early move circling around horses at the three furlong pole to bid outside in the four path at the quarter marker but could not find more and stalled
in the final eighth. GIZMO'S MISSION was off slowly at the start spotting the field down the backside early on, caught up to the pack two deep at the half,
tapped on the breaks inside when the field bunched up entering the turn, had clear run on the fence in mid stretch but could not offer a finish to the wire.
TORY'S HOLIDAY broke outwards at the start, stalked three deep in the early going, was steadied sharply with runners on either side entering the turn to
trail at the three furlong marker, swung out to the seven path for the stretch drive but could not find more and was not a factor to the finish. MR. MARSHALL
broke in at the start, prompted the pace outside three wide at the half, was hard ridden at the quarter pole vying for the lead in the two path and backed
away through the field in mid stretch.
