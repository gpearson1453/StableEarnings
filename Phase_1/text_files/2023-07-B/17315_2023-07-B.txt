Footnotes
FITTS N STARTS broke outward and a bit slowly, moved up to race in mid pack early toward the inside, closer from between horses late in the final turn,
challenged inside the leader when straightened for home, took over, held off the runner up late after drifting out a bit. TAP IRON FIST also broke back, void
of early foot, angled five wide when beginning to advance turning for home, late bid outside the winner, denied, clear for the place. EASY ACES raced back
and outside through the first turn, advanced and challenged second turn, came four wide into the stretch to lose ground to the winner, came back for the
show while not a match for the top two. DAISY DE ORO in the second flight, advanced and challenged three wide second turn, briefly clear upper stretch,
faltered. MIDNIGHT FAITH in the second flight off the inside, three wide into the straight, went evenly to the wire. MISS BARETA broke on top, dueled up
front through some quick early fractions, gave way far turn. SAINT MARY fell back to trail after the start and was never a menace. REMEMBERIN RONALD
alternated up front through those quick early fractions in the two path and stopped.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF WITS dueled up the backstretch off the inside, continued to battle through the turn, shook off the other speed to be clear in upper stretch,
maintained daylight to the finish under steady handling. MAVE RUNNER with the early pace between rivals, fell back into and through the turn, angled four
wide turning into the stretch, slowly getting to the winner late while holding sway for the place. JULIO CHOICE fell back after the start, began to advance
midway on the turn, came five wide and outside the runner up into the stretch, also closed the gap on the winner late while being outfinished for the place.
SARATOGA KAREN off a beat slow, raced back off the pace, improved position through the lane while not a threat to the top three. ANIME DAY in the
second flight out in the strip, raced three to four wide through the turn, came up empty for the drive. RESPECT ALL forwardly placed while racing outside in
the run up the backstretch, gave way in the turn. ASTRO FLASH broke inward and back, was used to move up and duel into the turn, gave way in the drive.
ARCTIC GUITAR fell back to trail after the start, showed little in remaining back.

Footnotes
HAL'S DREAM settled off the pace, asked along three wide second turn, firm handling while making slow but steady progress on the leader past the furlong
marker, just up at the wire. MACEE broke on top, soon cleared, set an unpressured and comfortable pace, nailed in the final strides. MYLIES STAR lacked
any early foot, four to five wide late in the final turn, rallied to be along for the show, not a threat to the top two. RYAN'S GRACE moved up to chase the
leader through those modest fractions for six furlongs, had little left for the stretch drive. GURKHA GOLD (IRE) in the second flight early, saved ground into
the stretch, failed to respond. BOSTON LUCILLE reared at the break, trailed early as a result, remained back in failing to muster a rally. KAITLYN'S COURT
finished early to also be always outrun.

Footnotes
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS in mid pack toward the inside early, knifed through three wide to challenge turning for home, kicked strongly clear under steady
handling. GOTTATAKEHIMTO lacked early foot outside, came four wide out of the final turn, rallied for the place down the middle of the strip, no match for
the winner. HEARTTHROB HALO in the main body outside, five wide early in the turn, six wide exiting, long drive for the place, outkicked late. AND FIFTY
forwardly placed out in the strip, moved a bit closer in the four path turning for home, went evenly the final furlong in lacking a closing punch.
GIMMEASOUND with the pace along the inside after breaking in good order, held a narrow advantage into the stretch, offered little resistance to the winner
soon after then began to weaken when headed by that one approaching the furlong marker. FLASHY PREMO void of speed, moved toward the inside turn,
improved position through traffic without posing a serious threat. GENIUS with the pace three wide for a half then faltered from between rivals. LT. BONURA
forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, began to retreat before a half. GALAXY BUILDER last to leave, void of speed, picked off some tiring rivals
after the issue had been decided. PRAY IDE SING broke sharp, vied up front between horses, gave way in the turn. COURAGEOUS TIMMY in a bit tight at
the break, remained back. MIDNIGHT BAYOU prompted the issue early out in the strip, moved closer in the turn then gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CHARLIE G bumped both sides at the break to be last away, unhurried off the inside, three wide into the lane, late bid, in time. RUSSIAN TANK closest to
the dueling leaders after breaking forwardly, chased that pair into the far turn when beginning to close the gap, outside bid, spirited stretch duel, led late,
nipped in the final strides while between horses at the wire. TODDCHERO broke on top, keen early when dueling past the wire the first time, continued to
alternate up front up the backstretch and into the far turn through some lively fractions, gained a bit larger advantage midway on the final bend before being
joined by the runner up from the outside, dueled stretch, proved stubborn to the end. MI SOLUTION away well, dueled up front closest to the inside,
steadied slightly along the rail early in the second turn, quickly recovered and also gave ground grudgingly through the stretch. FATHER RED unruly in the
gate, broke in, bumped winner, void of speed in trailing early, improved position slightly through the lane with some mild late interest. JUST DEAL WITH IT
broke out to also bump the winner, settled off the pace, came up empty for the drive while off the rail. COLOR FAST finished early to fall back to trail. A
CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MI SOLUTION AGAINST TODDCHERO FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE FAR TURN WAS NOT
ALLOWED.

RISING KOTO STAR back off the pace and outside, raced four wide through the turn, chased the two leaders past the furlong marker, late sure to be clear
at the end. CAJUN CYCLONE forwardly placed outside, advanced and challenged into the lane, dueled, led, proved no match for the winner late while
drawing clear for the second spot. BOLD CARLOS bothered at the start to race back early, asked along midway on the turn, four to five wide exiting the
turn, improved position to be clear of the others. OTRA COSA broke well, narrowly showed the way early inside, dueled into turn, second duel upper, caved
in late. I NITA WARRIOR back off the pace and the inside, floated out six wide by BOLD CARLOS turning for home, improved position a bit without posing a
serious threat. PUPPETEER off a step slow, trailed early, improved inside of several rivals turning for home then flattened out the final furlong. AUTUMN
ROB a bit green at the break, void of speed, passed a couple of tiring rivals to improve after the issue had been decided. GEM FRIEND broke in to bother
BOLD CARLOS, was straightened to race in the second flight, faded through the stretch. BABY'S LAST DANCE in mid pack for three furlongs, tired in the
drive. POUND OUT A DEAL dueled early off the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
LUMINOUS FLIGHT brushed, broke back, moved up inside, tracked the first flight inside, fell back a bit in some traffic turn, tipped out for the drive, firmly
roused, closed in game fashion to earn the dead heat on the outside. HUSHED COURT ROOM with the pace from the start off the inside, held a narrow
advantage out of the turn and past the furlong marker, held with good determination to earn part of the win. DOLLY'S GUITAR brushed start, last to leave,
raced back early inside, moved closer while continuing to save some ground exiting the turn, late bid inside the top two, outkicked by that pair late. TWO
JET back off the pace and the inside, three to four wide when roused turning for home,slow gain while widest of the first flight at the wire. CAJUN
CATALINA vied up front along the inside, continued to battle into the lane closest to the rail, weakened the final furlong to lose several positions. BUILDING
HOME lacked speed, raced three wide into the stretch, improved slightly. DEBBIES PASSAGE forwardly placed early while widest, four to six wide through
the turn, lacked a closing kick. SHESABEAUTYDANCER prompted the issue early, tired while five wide out of the turn. A RUNNIN AFLEET trailed
throughout out to be no factor.

Footnotes
CHARMING KAT in the second flight inside, shuffled back early in the turn, steered out three wide when being asked turning for home, challenged nearing
the furlong marker, drifted in to bother GYPSY JACKPOT soon after then edged clear late under steady handling. MS. PRIESTLY closest to the leader off
the inside, continued to chase through the turn and into the lane, lodged a mild bid a furlong out, could not match the winner late. HIGHER NOTE lacked
speed off rail, in traffic and four wide into the lane, finished willingly when clear. GYPSY JACKPOT in the second flight outside, three wide through the turn,
closer inside CHARMING KAT into the lane, bothered by that drifting rival past the furlong marker, regathered, nipped late for the third spot. SUM CHARM
broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace until just less than a furlong remained and faltered when headed. HALOS ALARM void of speed, continued
to lag through the turn, improved upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong. ZONG WAVE in mid pack, saved some ground into the lane, lacked a
closing rally. SUNSET FLASH lacked speed outside, five wide exiting the turn, also lacked a closing response. MEAN DREAMER in mid pack for a half,
backed up through the lane. OAK HILL STRONG last away, trailed, appeared to go wrong then fell exiting the turn unseating her rider. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF GYPSY JACKPOT AGAINST CHARMING CAT FOR INTERFERENCE IN
MIDSTRETCH, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH.
