Footnotes
MAP took command from the onset, comfortably set the pace opening up on the turn, began to get leg weary while urged in mid stretch and held on by a
diminishing margin at the finish for the win. WAR VOW travelled in midfield on the rail, shifted outside with five sixteenths to go commencing a rally, around
foes in upper stretch and offered a good late surge in deep stretch to make it close at the wire. INFINITE PASSION was void of speed early to trail on the
rail down the backstretch, advanced on the fence through the turn saving ground, continued the shortest way home in upper stretch and closed in well to
capture third crossing the line. ROOKIE COURT broke in at the start, tracked outside in the beginning, took closer order to the top two at the top of the lane
and was one paced just off the fence to the wire to get a minor share in the end. FRAC TALES was brushed outside at the break, chased the loose winner
down the backside and throughout the turn, was in the mix for a share of the prize straightening out for the drive and levelled off in the last sixteenth.
IMPOSSIBLE BERTIE settled near the rear outside runners in the early going, was roused on the turn making little impact and passed a straggler two
furlongs from the line but was not a factor to the finish. CAN'T STOP ME NOW stalked in midpack just off the fence, was hard ridden outside to stay up with
rivals three furlongs from the wire, had no response, backed away at the quarter pole and galloped to the finish.

Footnotes
BRIENNE OF TARTH had a good position tracking the top two inside, closed in on the contesting leaders on the rail midway on the turn, shot up the fence
to take over the lead in the final sixteenth and was drawing away at the finish. MY ASSISTANT prompted the pace outside in the early going, posed the
threat four wide straightening out for the stretch drive, was gaining steadily on the leader in mid stretch but could not match strides with the winner late and
was outkicked in the late stages of the race. WANT TO GO DANCING took the field up front down the backside, continued a narrow lead throughout the
turn, was clinging to the lead in the three path between rivals and gave way late losing place nearing the wire. LULU'S LULLABY broke in at the start taking
the worst exchanging bumps to trail after the start, rallied three wide circling runners midway on the turn, shifted inwards in mid stretch to show good late
energy and passed runners in the final sixteenth. LEGAL STEPS settled near the rear between horses in the five path down the back straight, offered a mild
rally closing the gap on the leaders two furlongs from home and offered little run to the wire while being pushed out by a tiring rival at the sixteenth pole.
MISS BIKINI had a good spot outside watching the engaging duo in the early stages, swung out five wide for the drive, stalled while drifting out at the
sixteenth pole and was on the wrong lead to the finish line. SPIRIT BELLE was alone stalking in the third flight alone down the backside, was roused for
more run on the run through the turn, made little gain and was not a factor in the stretch drive. SILENT WARNING broke out bumping rival at the start,
settled four wide near the rear at the half mile marker, was shuffled with runners on either side to be last on the turn and was not a presence to the finish.

STORMY SUZIE was allowed to settle near the rear with rivals on either side at the half mile marker, was nudged on for more to keep position behind foes
on the turn, could see the field in the stretch drive, found clear running room in the five path at the furlong marker and burst through in deep stretch to get up
for the win nearing the wire. GORMLEY GIRL tracked the lone speed outside throughout the turn, closed in with every stride three wide at the top of the
stretch, briefly took command at the sixteenth pole and could not hold off the late surge by the winner in deep stretch. WAKE UP MAGGIE was unhurried in
hand on the rail near the rear at the half, tapped on the brakes on the fence with seven sixteenths from home, shuffled back to last midturn, was looking for
room behind horses at the top of the lane, found room in the four path at the furlong marker and closed in to get up winning the show photo at the wire.
HALO STYLE leapt up at the start to trail in the early going, settled three deep near the rear down the backside, rallied three wide around foes with three
eighths remaining, was in the mix outside turning for home, could not continue the sustained run late and stalled late. ABSOLUTE JEWEL tracked inside the
loose speed on the turn, closed the gap on the leader in the two path turning for home, battled in upper stretch between foes, lost momentum briefly at the
eighth pole and re-rallied in deep stretch to be involved in the show photo. I'M A CUTIE was away slowly to begin, quickly pulled its rider to the front while
under restraint down the backside, settled down to open up on rivals throughout the turn, was asking for the wire in mid stretch and stopped on fence in
deep stretch. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING #6 HALO STYLE AT THE START RESULTED IN #6 HALO STYLE RUNNING FOR PURSE MONEY

Footnotes
JAB was lightly brushed at the start, settled at the back racing off the inside, took closer order heading up the backstretch but lacked room near the
seven-sixteenths, altered out for the far turn, circled past foes seven wide late on that bend, took aim on the leader, wore that one down to prevail late.
WELL ACTUALLY broke alertly and went straight to the lead to set the pace racing off the rail, was clear into the far turn and extended the advantage on
that bend, was clear into upper stretch, led till late and was nailed. INSCRUTABLE settled tracking inside mid-pack, came out three wide coming past the
quarter pole moving between foes, loomed a threat in the stretch, drifted to the rail in mid-stretch and ran on evenly. O WOW brushed a rival at the start,
settled between foes in the second flight, moved out a bit up the backstretch then back in heading to the far turn racing two to three wide, was in a bit tight at
the three-eighths, continued three then four wide on that far turn advancing between foes, came out a bit further in upper stretch and ran on. LA
PRINCESSA POLLY was forwardly-positioned stalking three to four wide early, forced out from three to five wide on the far turn, dropped back and failed to
rally. CRASH THE CREASE moved forward four then three wide stalking the leader around the first turn and up the backstretch, dropped back and faded.
SHEBATOWN settled at the back in the three to four path through the first turn, advanced some fanning from four to six wide on the far turn, could not
sustain the effort. STRIKE THE POSE was forwardly-positioned staking the pacesetter three wide into the first turn, was taken up slightly outside the five-
and one-half and tucked in behind the leading pair tracking from the rail, came up empty.

Footnotes
HARD TO CAPTURE got away alertly, was quickly clear, shifted in a bit setting the pace from just off the rail, bounded clear in upper stretch when asked
and extended the margin through the wire under hand urging. OHEAVENS exchanged a bump at the start, settled off the pace, raced outside foes four then
five wide on the turn, gained the place while no threat to the winner. PINO IN A PURSE was forwardly-positioned up the backstretch off the eventual winner,
chased that one from outside three wide on the turn and under some urging, was no match, lost place late. MISS BOBBIT exchanged a bump at the start,
shifted in racing toward the back, went two to four wide on the turn, came out further at the three-sixteenths for room, ran on for the minor award. MI
TORMENTA raced mid-pack going four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD settled at the back, fanned seven wide into upper stretch,
was forced out a bit further by a rival, needed more. AIRY FAIRY chased from between runners, exchanged light brushing early, went two to three wide on
the turn, failed to rally. ANITA GRIGIO was bumped at the start then strongly urged forward, exchanged minor contact early, chased inside, had no late kick.
MIDNIGHT MEADOW exchanged light brushing in the early going and was in just a bit tight, eased back to track in behind racing two to three wide into the
turn, faded. CEDAR VALLEY bumped a rival at the start, settled at the rear, came off the rail, went three wide early on the turn swinging five deep, was
never a threat.

Footnotes
DESTINIQUE pressed for the lead with rivals on either side throughout the turn, bid four wide straightening out for the stretch drive, stubbornly fought on to
gain control at the furlong marker and pulled away nearing the wire. JILL tracked four wide in the middle of the pack, rallied around runners four deep at the
quarter pole, loomed the threat outside in the six path for the stretch drive and battled to the wire holding for the place share crossing the line. INDIAN
MUSIC prompted three deep down the backside and on the turn, was in range five deep for a share of the prize at the top of the lane, yielded some in mid
stretch and gamely re-rallied between foes late to get up for third money at the wire. HELLO FRIENDS trailed the pack on the fence down the backstretch,
saved ground seeing the field running on the turn, swung seven wide for the drive to the wire and was running on late gaining steadily on foes but just ran
out of room missing out in the four horse photo for the show money at the finish. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) settled near the rear in the two path at the half,
waited behind the contesting trio battling for the lead on the turn, found clear running room in lane three turning for home but could not fire between horses
to threaten in deep stretch. SPARKLE SAMMY took command dictating the pace down the backside, continued narrowly upfront while hounded outside by
runners on the turn, was clinging onto the lead straightening out for the drive and backed away on the fence in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
LOIS had a perfect scenario tracking all alone watching the top duo engage at the half, was asked to go keeping position three furlongs from home,
assumed command at the top of the lane and drew away comfortably to the finish. GAV'S DREAM GIRL stalked four deep in mid pack with four furlongs
remaining, was urged to go after the leaders four wide around horses at the three eighths marker and chased the winner in vain down the stretch to the
finish. SO BREANNA was off slowly breaking in at the start, advanced three wide outside midway on the turn, shifted to the four path for the drive and
closed late between foes to be a clear third in the end. HEKLA'S AURA trailed the field at the half, made little impression running through the turn and
finished with some late interest to pass tiring horses in the final sixteenth. CELTIC REVIVAL settled on the rail in midfield, was briefly taken a hold of on the
rail seven sixteenths from the wire, advanced inside to be in with a chance for a piece of the prize turning for home but stalled in the final eighth. LADY IN
RED broke out at the start, was hustled for the lead down the back straight, battled outside on the turn, was carried out by rival two furlongs from the finish,
could not recover in the eleven path in upper stretch and was not a factor to the wire. HOT OMELET forced the pace on the rail under a tight rein down the
backside, had a slim lead inside entering the turn, was getting out considerably at the quarter pole to be in the ten path when straightening out for the stretch
finish and was not persevered with down the lane.

Footnotes
ASHLEE'S RING was nestled on the rail behind the frontrunner down the backstretch, shifted off the early tiring pacesetter at the three eighths pole, was
nudged to go after the leader two furlongs from the finish, loomed the only threat turning for home and wore down the rival through the lane to draw clear
nearing the wire. TURF AND SURF was reined in soon after the start leaving the chute to be four deep outside runners, advanced smartly at the half, took
command outside in hand three furlongs from the wire, opened up mildly at the quarter marker and was outfinished by the winner while comfortably besting
the rest in the end. MAKAYLA travelled in mid pack down the backside, started to pick up runners three wide with three furlongs remaining, continued to dig
in in upper stretch and finished up to be a clear third alone at the wire. SANDY GRACE co-trailed on the outside down the back straight, offered a mild turn
of foot three deep at the quarter pole and fought on through the lane to get up for a small share of the prize in the end. SMART IRENE was unhurried trailing
on the rail down the backstretch, took closer order on the leaders when the field bunched up three furlongs from the finish, was on hold behind a tiring early
leader with five sixteenths to go, shifted just out for clear run and battled down the stretch between foes for the minor share. THIS ONE CAN RUN chased
the frontrunner in the early going, battled inside for the top spot midway on the turn, gave way under a hard ride with three sixteenths to go and emptied out
in the final furlong. CLOUDY VOYAGE took this field down the backside on the rail, was collared outside by a couple of rivals three furlongs from the finish,
backed away through the field on the fence midpoint on the turn and was not involved in the run down the stretch.
