Footnotes
GIROOVIN brushed the off side stall at the start and came under coaxing, raced four wide in aim of the leader, advanced in tandem with
SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL half a mile from home, tucked to the two path and dueled through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, floated six
then five wide into upper stretch when under a left handed crop, rallied to take command a furlong from home, edged away under a drive kept to task.
SPEAKINOFTHEDEVIL coaxed from the gate, chased briefly just off the inside in closest aim of the early leader before tipping to the three path and
advancing strongly to take over command at the half mile pole, got joined by the aforementioned foe to the outside and knocked heads through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path to look GIROOVIN in the eye and was collared a
furlong from home, ran on to chase the winner home well clear of the rest and along second best. FIGHT FIERCELY hustled from the start, chased along
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and improved position to secure the show honors. SWAY'SINMYDNA stumbled at the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened in the stretch. GABE hustled from the gate, showed the way early on two to three wide,
got displaced with a rush half a mile from home and quickly found himself chasing tucked inside through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
JOLLY MISS JILL went to the front, showed the way while well rated in the two path, was challenged on the far turn, responded well when asked
approaching the quarter-pole, was given one pop of a right-handed crop in upper stretch then switched to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker, shook off
the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. YOGI went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was
asked in the three path on the far turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, came out while shying from a left-handed crop multiple times in upper stretch,
shied in when switched to a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner late while well clear for the place. HANDLE
THE TRUTH settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response then just held the
show. SUSIE'S SAVER was a bit awkwardly into stride, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, moved closer with five furlongs to
run, was urged three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and just missed the show. BRAVO REGINA bumped with a rival at the start, raced
in the two path early on the first turn, moved to three then four wide later on that bend, settled outside under some urging, chased four wide on the far turn
and came up empty. JOEY THE FISH dropped back while showing no speed then angled quickly to the inside, saved ground at the rear through the far turn
and was no factor. JACKSON AVENUE went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, dropped back four
wide on the far turn and failed to respond. ALICE KRAMDEN bumped with a foe at the start, traveled three wide on the first turn, was well placed just off the
pace while inside of an opponent, went around the far turn in the two path under urging and retreated.

Footnotes
SUNSET LOUISE broke out at the start, raced three then two wide through the opening bend settling to show the way rated four then three wide down the
backstretch, suddenly shied out a path just inside the nine-sixteenths and had the rider apply a tap of the crop to the right shoulder to correct, widened away
in hand through the far turn given a notch to work with while just off the inside, swung three wide into upper stretch, got briefly roused near the eighth pole
drawing off before being geared down through the final sixteenth to prevail comfortably on the line. SKRATCH KAT chased two to three wide under coaxing
from the seven-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while well clear of the remaining rival. LINNY KATE along
the inside through the opening bend, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path with nine-sixteenths to go, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
ENSIGN PARKER pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path midway through the turn, shook clear approaching the quarter-pole,
drifted out under a left-handed crop in upper stretch then switched to a right-handed crop and drew off under steady urging. LET FREEDOM SPRING
pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back late on the backstretch then moved out, shifted from the two path to the four path early on the turn, chased
the leader on the outside, spun five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. CHARGER went to the front, set the
pace under pressure from both sides, was headed under urging while inside midway through the turn, dropped back coming to the quarter-pole and tired but
held the show. HEREBY was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside lead in the drive
and failed to threaten. PRINCE OF JOY was urged along towards the rear, rounded the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, dropped back
while remaining on his inside lead to near the sixteenth-pole and capitulated. MERCHANTS OF COOL broke near the back then settled at the rear of the
field, went three to four wide early on the turn, dropped in later on the bend, reached the rail outside the quarter-pole and was no factor. NORGAY was last
to commence then hustled, raced on the outside while ridden along, lugged out from four to six wide on the turn, floated eight wide into the stretch and
faltered.

quarter-pole, rallied inside through a clear opening to get the lead inside the furlong marker, shook clear coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved best under
good handling. SHERIFF BIANCO was hustled from the gate then coaxed along on the outside, chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid while driven
six wide into upper stretch, battled outside of three foes into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. BABY
YODA showed speed between foes, vied in the two path while asked on the turn, turned three wide into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled
under a drive into the final furlong and weakened then just missed the place while able to get the show. SHOOTERS SHOOT was sent from the start,
showed speed on the outside then pressed the pace, vied in the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and tired. BOURBON CALLING was hustled from the gate then coaxed along on the outside, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. MR

hand-ride while four then three wide on the turn, made an outside bid into upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up to the finish and narrowly prevailed under
strong urging. MARLEY'S GHOST bumped lightly with a foe at the start, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the two path through the turn,
made a bid into upper stretch, dueled inside of the winner, drifted out late and just missed while well clear for the place. NORTHWAY was hustled from the
gate then urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
SHE'S A NINE bumped with a rival at the start, angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, dropped from the three path to
the two path on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and tired. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT dropped back near the five-eighths, went three then two
wide on the turn and never reached contention. MAGNOLIA WIND was urged along off the pace, saved ground on the turn, came out into the stretch and
failed to threaten. STRANGE FRUIT settled on the outside under some urging, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to
respond. BELLA SONADORA dropped well behind, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. IRISH EMPRESS bumped with a rival at the
start, chased the pace down the backstretch, came up empty in the five path on the turn and retreated.
