BUREAU hesitated at the break, was hustled up from outside to share the lead before finishing two furlongs, was two wide on the bend, edged ahead with a
sixteenth left, drifted out under left-handed pressure in the waning yards but held sway. LASTFORTINOFAMILY broke inward, bumping A BOLD RYDE,
moved to the outside early on, lost ground, three to five wide through the turn, took over second inside the sixteenth marker, closed well but came up short.
A BOLD RYDE bumped at the start, pressed the pace from the beginning, was three then four wide taking the bend and could only hold his position late
from between rivals. LAYTON THE DAY vied for the lead from inside from the start but gradually wore down inside the final sixteenth. HIGHLY PERFECT
displayed early speed between horses, began to retreat before finishing three furlongs, stayed just off the rail through the turn and lacked a significant
stretch bid.

Footnotes
ZARMAE broke alertly, was rated off the early speed, moved out widest midway on the backstretch, was let out into the second bend, closed the gap three
wide, floated out some entering the lane, gained the lead under urging inside the last furlong and was drawing off inside the final sixteenth. READY
REDDING prompted the pace from outside, moved in beside WILLOW RIDGE midway on the backstretch, went for the lead on the second turn, edged
ahead with a furlong left, could not stay with ZARMAE inside the last eighth but drew away for second the final seventy yards. WILLOW RIDGE disputed or
set the pace from inside, was not match for ZARMAE inside the final eighth and flattened out deep stretch. MEMORY BANK was a brief factor but steadily
faded from just off the rail once on the backstretch.

DART ATTACK broke on top, was gradually forced in by SEMINOLE MIDNIGHT while sharing the lead in hand approaching the end of the first eighth,
moved clear when allowed on the bend, lengthened command under a drive in the lane then continued to maintain full control while under mild urging in the
late going. ENVEY N ICE bumped just after the break, progressed from inside on the bend, took over second upper stretch, steadily drifted out inside the
final furlong but was unchallenged for the place. SEMINOLE MIDNIGHT steadily angled in as she vied for the early lead, brushed with DARK ATTACK
nearing the end of the first furlong, was moved off the latter approaching the half mile marker, did not stay with DART ATTACK on the bend, gradually
yielded and angled in some when ENVEY N ICE came into her path nearing the sixteenth marker. BRIANA HARPER raced in contention from outside on
the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, angled outside SEMINOLE MIDNIGHT upper stretch and failed to have a significant response. W W VALID was
bumped solidly and forced into ENVEY N ICE at the start and was never a factor. LONGLIVEROCKNROLL broke inward, bumped solidly with W W VALID
and gave way from just off the inside on the bend.

Footnotes
CAHOKIA POSSE broke outward, was urged to dispute the early pace, was three wide through the bend, lugged in under right-handed pressure midstretch,
shook off FAST KYLIE inside the seventy-yard marker and held on nearing the wire. LUTION settled well back and well off the inside, picked up her pace
after a quarter mile, saved ground taking the turn, gradually angled out for a clear path upper stretch, surged inside the last eighth but came up short. TU
ROYAL contested the pace between horses, was two wide through the bend, retreated slightly upper stretch, was checked off CAHOKIA POSSE'S heels
near the eighth pole, altered out and only held her position late. FAST KYLIE contested the pace inside from the beginning then slowly wore down inside the
final sixteenth. TOUR DE' PORT prominent early, had the rail on the bend, angled out four wide upper stretch and failed to have a significant response.
HARPER BRIANA forced out at the break, was a contender from outside on the backstretch but faded widest on the turn. There was a stewards' inquiry into
TU ROYAL'S loss of action midstretch and the rider of TU ROYAL lodged an objection claiming interference from CAHOKIA POSSE at the eighth pole. After
their review, the stewards disqualified CAHOKIA POSSE for coming in without being clear of another horse midstretch and was placed third.

Footnotes
TAPIT SAM shared the early lead from outside, angled in beside READTHETRANSCRIPT on the bend, gradually angled out as the latter came out in the
lane and edged ahead in the waning yards. READTHETRANSCRIPT vied for the lead inside rivals but off the rail, saved ground taking the turn, gradually
drifted out as he gamely fought for the lead in the stretch but did not have enough left nearing the wire. BAM BAM CAM a step slow at the break, progressed
from outside to take over third on the bend, came into the lane from path four, loomed a threat with a furlong to go, leveled off instead but was easily best of
the others. STOSH prominent just off the inside, moved to the rail for a clear path midway on the backstretch, faded after three furlongs and only passed a
few tiring rivals from inside the last quarter mile. TRIPLE CHROME chased from not far off the inside, was three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning six
wide entering the stretch, had a striking position with a furlong left but could not sustain his bid late. CITY POSITION disputed the early pace between rivals,
did not keep up two wide on the bend, swung outside BAM BAM CAM for the stretch run and steadily yielded. PACHI displayed early speed between horses
but began to fade two wide on the turn.

Footnotes
WILDCAT BOBBIE gradually progressed from just off the inside, floated out to path four entering the lane, rallied the last eighth to engage NOT TO BE
DENIED nearing the final sixteenth, battled on even terms the rest of the way and got the nod at the wire. NOT TO BE DENIED prominent from the
beginning, angled outside MISS WINDY SLEW on the first turn, moved up beside that one on the backstretch, fought to hold the advantage under
right-handed pressure in the stretch but had to settle for second best in a game effort. MISS WINDY SLEW soon had a clear lead and took the rail on the
first bend, was challenged on the backstretch, dueled in tight quarters in the stretch, did not have enough left the final sixteenth but was easily best of the
rest. MIKE'S LADY chased from off the inside and was never a factor. SENORITA AURORA began to gradually fade from inside once on the backstretch.

Footnotes
CANDY LOOKER was encouraged to vie for the early lead, moved clear midway on the backstretch, was allowed to lengthen her lead on the bend, roused
leaving the turn and proved much the best while under mild urging in the lane. SCAPITURE was bumped from the rear at the break, was soon prompting the
pace from between rivals, moved clear for second on the turn, came into the lane from path three, slowly drifted out but lased for the place. BACKSTAGE
BAMBI in contention from outside on the backstretch, did not keep up four wide on the bend, took over third upper stretch, gradually angled out the last
eighth and could only make up minor ground the last eighth. MISS DUTTON broke a step slowly and inward, bumping SCAPITURE, was hustled up
between rivals to be an early factor, did not stay close two wide on the turn but closed the gap belatedly from between horses deep stretch. OH LA DE DA
was a factor from inside for nearly four furlongs then gave way. LITTLE ACCOUNT prominent between foes on the backstretch, faded three wide on the
bend.
