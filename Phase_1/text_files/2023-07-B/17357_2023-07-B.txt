Footnotes
CRUSIN LIKE A CAT broke in good order, dueled up front in the two path, continued to alternate for the advantage through the turn, disposed of the other
speed while drifting in slightly in mid stretch then had enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MISS LEONA back off the early pace, four wide into the
lane, set down, rallied down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner, too late for that one, edged clear 2nd. TRUE PRINCESS dueled up front
closest to the inside, continued to vied into the lane, was beginning to yield when put in a bit tight by the winner a furlong out, continued to weaken to lose
the place. MARIAH chased the dueling leader for three furlongs and had little for the drive. KATIES FACTOR last away, trailed throughout in failing to
threaten. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF TRUE PRINCESS AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH WAS
NOT ALLOWED.

KNOCKALITTLELOUDER broke best of all, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home, drew out through upper
stretch, token encouragement late. UNFATHOMED closest to the dueling leader for a half, proved no match for the winner the final furlong, clearly second
best. QUANA DUDE went one paced throughout while well out in the strip to finish up best of the rest. WHY JOEY WHY dueled up front closest to the inside
for four furlongs, first to blink. FOOLISH DREAMS well back off the early pace, failed to muster a response in the drive. GALLANT STAR fell back to trail,
never a threat.

Footnotes
COROT asked for some run out of the gate to maintain inside position, dueled up the backstretch and through the turn closest to the inside, continued to
alternate for the advantage into the lane, long drive, gained a larger lead late, just lasted to hold the runner up safe with his rider standing up in the saddle
two jumps from the wire. IN THE ARCH void of early foot after being last away, continued to lag through the turn while in the three path, set down for the
drive, shifted out a bit approaching the furlong marker, late burst to narrowly miss nailing the winner at the wire. AHIMAAZ broke well, set or forced the pace
in the two path, continued to battle outside the winner through the stretch, proved stubborn to the end while between the top two at the wire. BEHIND THE
CURTAIN in the second flight behind the dueling leaders, came up empty when asked for the drive. FLUFFPOINT in the second flight toward the inside, had
little left late. COMPLEX SYSTEM was never a serious threat. MORE LIKE IT fell back to trail after the start, never threatened.

Footnotes
HARD FOUR with the early pace between foes, shuffled back from some traffic into the turn, moved out, five wide move to become prominent again
entering the stretch, put a head in front nearing midstretch, surged clear, held the runner up comfortably safe late under steady handling. VIKING LEGACY
steadied at the break to be away slowly, continued well back into and through the turn, came widest for the drive and launched a rally down the middle of
the strip to be closing the gap on the winner late. PEANUT N IKE lacked early foot outside into the turn, three wide exiting, shifted out past the furlong
marker, staged a mild rally to annex the show. DIAL UNCLE JOEY broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to hold the advantage
toward the inside into the stretch, began to weaken when headed by the winner soon after. GOLDENLUTE pressed the issue for three furlongs while
between horses and began to weaken. F T W SLAM forwardly placed early while saving ground, backed up while remaining inside. SKIPPA within striking
distance while racing outside, gave way in upper stretch while in some traffic.

Footnotes
TENSAS ALL OURS broke out and in mid pack, moved up to stalk three wide, continued to patiently track the leaders from the outside up the backstretch,
took over late in the final turn, strongly clear, ridden out. IDE LIKE HAWAII four wide first turn when off the pace, continued outside up the backstretch, three
wide second turn, rallied to be closest to the winner a sixteenth out, no match for that one while holding sway late for the place. K V TARGET void of speed
outside after being last away, four wide turning for home, set down, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. CATINANDSCATIN set or forced the
pace after breaking in good order, held a narrow advantage over the winner midway on the final turn, headed by that one entering the stretch, drifted out
when offering little resistance and weakened. SABER STORM in some traffic while three wide in the first turn, continued one paced and finished up evenly
in lacking a closing response. SABERMAN within striking distance early, fell back after a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals through the lane while not
posing a serious threat. DARK MATTER broke back and remained there in failing to menace. BERNIE SPECIAL set or forced the pace for almost six
furlongs closest to the inside and faltered. ADMIRAL AFLEET in mid pack most of the way, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
DONEGAL ARROW in the second group up the backstretch outside, lodged a four wide move when moving to challenge exiting the turn, drew clear late
under steady urging. TIZ DONEGAL vied up front in the run up the backstretch, garnered a larger advantage through the turn, raced on equal terms with the
winner past the furlong marker then proved no match late, remained comfortably clear for the second spot. GREAT RUNNER within striking distance, raced
in some traffic second turn, went one paced the final furlong to prove no match for the top pair. MONOLITH void of speed, was roused three wide turning for
home, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position. JOHNNNY'S GAME with the first flight three wide early, continued to vie into the turn,
weakened through the stretch. KISSOFTHENILE vied front while between horses for a half, began to weaken thereafter. GROSSE TETE IAN remained
back in failing to threaten. MOTANAAFER remained back to be always outrun. EMPYREAL SHADOW fell back after the start, continued to race sluggishly
and also was never involved.

Footnotes
IZZY'S BABY BOY broke well from along the inside, continued to show the way up the backstretch and second turn, found more through the lane when
confronted, enough left to last at the wire. NATE'S ATTACK between horses up the backstretch when off the pace, dropped inside second turn, cut the
corner to reach contention into the stretch, closer still inside nearing midstretch, stalled, switched out late, willingly, missed at the wire. ONE TIME GEM in
mid pack early while outside, moved closer late in the final turn to a challenging position, failed to sustain that advance on the winner through the lane. RUN
ROCKET fell back to trail, continued to lack speed, improved position a bit after being roused into the lane with some modest late interest. STANDING MAN
also lacked any early speed, failed to muster a rally when called on in the drive. SEEHOSS within striking distance early, was finished after a half. AFLEET
ASCENT chased the winner for five furlongs and began to give way.

home,quickly clear, ridden out. CZAR'S BALLERINA broke in, bothered foe, raced behind the pace inside, continued to save ground second turn, steered
out for the drive, clear for the place without posing a threat to the winner. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA broke on top, soon got clear, set the pace while rating
the middle half, offered brief resistance to the winner turning for home then proved no match for that one or the runner up, comfortably saved the show.
CRYSTAL D'ORO raced off the pace and the inside, failed to respond when called on for the drive. SCARLET STORM chased the leader for five furlongs,
caved in far turn. START WELL bothered at the start, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
DR STRICKLANDS ACE back off the early pace outside, advanced on the leader four wide through the turn, carried out by that one into the stretch, gained
the advantage when straightened for home, drew well clear under a steady hand ride in a promising debut. SECRET GUITAR settled in mid pack, steadied
in traffic into the turn, roused midway on the bend after recovering, closed with good resolve to be up in time for the place, not a threat to the winner. FAST
OUT off a step slow, lacked speed four a half, staged a late rally to be up for the show. STRUMMIN MARY back off the pace, shuffled back rail with a half to
run, into the stretch off the inside, mild late interest to improve slightly. KRAZY KATIE quickly sprinted clear after the start, set the pace, got out carrying the
winner out late in the turn then faltered when headed by that one in upper stretch. SPARKLE CITY chased the early leader then began a steady fade before
three furlongs. HAIRTRIGGER HEART within striking distance on the outside of the second flight, faded. DEE'S LIL FOOL was finished after three furlongs.
