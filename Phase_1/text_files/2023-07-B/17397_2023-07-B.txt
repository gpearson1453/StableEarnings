Footnotes
KAYLOR sped the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the pace along the inside up the backstretch, held firm around the far
turn, saved ground entering the lane, roused flor more in upper stretch, responded, widened advantage then dropped whip in the final furlong, kept to task
under a strong hand ride and prevailed. THE AWFUL TRUTH was allowed to settle out of the gate and saved ground on the first turn, steadily edged up
closer heading into the backstretch, raced in contention then lacked racing room along the rail on the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive, made a solid run
for the winner but had to settle for second best. SING LUCY SING was forwardly placed around the first turn and sat just off the leader up the backstretch,
came under a ride midway around the far turn, swung three paths wide into the lane and stayed on for a share. STREAKIN' EASY raced in range three to
four wide up the backstretch, coaxed three to four wide around the far turn, came four paths wide into the lane and had no late kick. NAUTICAL MISS
tracked the pace between rivals midway up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the turn and weakened in the lane. RUDY TOOTY was
unhurried and raced in the back, edged closer then given cue late on the far turn but had no response.

SPANISH DELIGHT quickly advanced along the rail soon after the start and took over the early lead, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, held
clear racing in hand around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, widened advantage without asking, then came under a mild ride then finished wrapped
up. MY FIRST PEARL raced off the pace up the backstretch, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung four paths wide into the lane and rallied to clear
second best. TIFFANY TWIST chased in contention along the inside, hustled along three wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared
the rest. BLAZE AWAY N HIDE broke sharply from the outside then conceded position to SPANISH DELIGHT soon after the start, tracked the pace setter
into the turn, came under a drive two wide at the head of the lane, failed to respond and steadily weakened. MISSYINTOMISCHIEF was not too far back
tracking the top trio mid-way up the backstretch, hustled along the rail around the turn and into the lane but failed to move on.

SLUSHY sprinted out to the early lead and set the pace through the backstretch, held clear still unleashed around the turn, saved ground entering the lane,
roused for more upper stretch, responded willingly and finished going away. SINGING EMMA was forwardly placed up the backstretch, chased two wide
around the turn, sustained bid for the clear leader and finished second best. BREW CASA rated outside off the early leaders, was ridden along four paths
wide late on the turn, continued bid into the lane and cleared a share. MILLIGANMIKEANDME raced between rivals in the compact flight that sat off the top
two leaders, hustled along three wide around the turn then steadily weakened. DIXIE PENNY sat between foes in the compact flight that raced off the top
pair, hustled along two wide around the turn then tired in the drive. ADMIRAL'S GARNET rated while saving ground through early stages, chased along the
rail on the turn then faded in the lane.

Footnotes
TOPPER T sprinted out to the clear lead soon after the start and angled to the inside, led the way by a clear margin up the backstretch, widened advantage
still racing in hand around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, continued to pull away from the field, shook the reins a couple times then finished
wrapped up. JUSTA STREAK rated off the early pace, hustled along three paths wide into the lane and got up late for place. LATE FOR LUNCH was off a
bit slow at the start and quickly advanced along the inside, raced in contention off the clear leader up the backstretch, chased on the rail around the turn and
ran on through the lane for a share. TOSKA'S RULER tracked the clear leader up the backstretch, hustled along two wide around the turn then gave way.
CHINLEE rated off the early pace, moved up into closer contention midway around the turn then weakened through the lane. LORD OF THE PALACE raced
in the back, came four to five wide into stretch run and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CANDY'S LITTLE TIP was well placed sitting just off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground and edged closer late on the turn, slipped through the
inside of LANCELOT N ELAINE at the head of the lane, took over the lead and kept clear. HUNKA BURNING LOVE rated off the early pace, began to pick
up the tempo late on the turn, swung four wide into the lane, angled in a path, advanced then tipped out wider and got up late for place. MONTEREY
PENINSULA stalked the embattled pair up the backstretch, loomed three wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the lane and just lasted for show.
CHARMING CHARLIE raced off the pace, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, moved up closer between rivals then made another
move between foes at the sixteenth pole, shifted to the inside and got nipped for show. RICKEY B broke sharply then quickly took on the challenge from
LANCELOT N ELAINE, dueled for the lead up the backstretch, could not continue to match strides approaching the quarter pole and gave way. LANCELOT
N ELAINE dueled inside of RICKEY B for the lead up the backstretch, shook free near the quarter pole, came off the inside and got collared by rail running
winner at the head of the lane, ran on to the eighth pole then came up empty. PRICE TO PAY lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around
the turn and failed to move into contention.
