Footnotes
RECKLESS AFFAIR settled off of the inside, advanced between horses through the second turn, tipped out four wide entering the stretch, dug in and was
fully extended to narrowly prevail. JUST PRAISE was unhurried into stride, worked his way forward through traffic on the second bend, angled out entering
the stretch to be clear, continued on well but was unable to best the determined winner. UP FOR THE CHANCE tracked three deep, launched a bold bid
nearing the quarter pole, took over entering the stretch, but wilted during the drive and settled for the minor award. RAPA NUI settled toward the inside,
shifted out nearing the furlong marker a finished with a belated improvement. CONRADO prompted the pace three wide through the second turn and gave
way. HUNTIN' THE RUT set the pressured pace along the inside, disputed the issue to the final furlong and faded. DUDEWITHTHEDIAMOND went wide,
moved up to make a mild bid on the second turn, but came up empty after six furlongs and dropped out.

Footnotes
CHARLOTTE THE BRIT tracked four wide, made a sweeping move through the turn, reeled in the leaders nearing the furlong marker and drew away. FOLK
HERO was slow into stride, settled at the tail of the field, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, moved up three wide on the turn, angled to the far
outside and continued on well to earn the runner up spot. PROPER MANNERS was away in good order, vied for the early lead, settled off of the pace three
wide, but flattened between rivals in the final furlong and just failed to hold the place. BATH AND TENNIS (IRE) was taken in hand leaving the chute, settled
off of the inside and lacked a response when asked. LAWN DART rushed up along the inside, opened clear to dictate terms, was collared entering the
stretch, stayed on to the final furlong and succumbed.

Footnotes
RED PIXIE was nearest the pace off of the inside, cut into the leaders advantage on the second turn, took over entering the stretch and kicked clear.
BEAUTIFUL STAR was fractious in gate, sped well clear, weakened leaving the second turn, relinquished the lead inside the three-sixteenths pole, but
churned on to preserve the place spot. LADY LANA settled between, pulled forward, shifted out 4w, finished with a belated advance to garner the minor
award. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL was allowed to settle, made a mild bid between foes three deep, but failed to sustain the drive. NEVISIAN SPIRIT tucked in
to save ground, got through but lacked the needed response. MIDNIGHT PIRATE saved ground to no avail.

PROTECTTHEWITNESS sped clear to set the pace, widened down the backstretch, settled into the stretch still clear and maintained a diminishing
advantage. DOMINANT STRANGER settled off of the inside, ranged up three wide, kept on well but was unable to bridge the gap. WINE WITH A ROSE
broke a step slow, was unhurried into stride, circled four wide to make her bid, but flattened in the final furlong. ZORA settled in hand off of the inside, took
closer order on the second turn, but went evenly through the drive. FAMILY BAND was between horses through the first turn, made a middle move and was
nearest the leader after a half, stayed on to the final furlong and tired. BE SHARP was fractious in the gate, was forwardly placed to the second turn and
faded. SORTARIA contended along the inside for five furlongs and dropped out.

TAKEMETOTHEBEACH sped clear to dictate terms off of the inside, was kept to task and gamely led throughout. DANCING SPIRIT tracked three deep,
loomed a danger entering the stretch but was unable to best the determined winner. ROTONDO attended the pace along the inside, got through but lacked
the needed late kick. MAIDEN LANE hopped at the start to get away slow, moved into contention three wide, but flattened during the drive. WHISPERING
SEA settled in the second flight three wide and failed to make headway. CLOUD IN THE WIND broke in, came away slow and never recovered.
CRABAPPLE settled four wide and was never a factor.

WROTE IN STONE came away in good order, opened clear to set the pace, dug in under stern urging and held sway. GINS AND TINS tracked along the
inside, got through entering the stretch, tipped out a bit with a furlong to run, kicked on once uncovered but was kept at bay. TWIRLING MAMBA chased
WROTE IN STONE outside, drifted out a bit entering the stretch and weakened. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) broke a step slow, settled saving ground, got
through but failed to seriously threaten. CHARMED (GB) was never a factor. STRANGE ARRANGE was hustled along three wide in the second flight, came
up empty before going a half and retreated.

CAPTAIN COURTNEY settled in hand toward the inside, worked her way forward under a tug through the turn, shifted out and took dead aim entering the
stretch, engulfed SCOTTISH SYMPHONY a furlong out and drew off to score with something left. SCOTTISH SYMPHONY set the pressured pace off of the
inside, edged clear on the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, but kept on to clearly prove the best of the rest. RUSTY MY BROTHER was
close up three deep, moved with the winner through the turn, was unable to go on with that one, flattened in the drive and settled for the minor award.
WINGS OF A SONG was unhurried, got through to make a mild bid entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. GOLDEN MOONLIGHT was away
alertly, contested the pace outside for a half and stopped.

PATH TO VICTORY settled in hand, advanced off of the inside on the second turn, shifted out for clear sailing with a quarter to run, took over at will and
drew off to score as the rider pleased. SUPER GEUSE attended the pace off of the inside, launched a bold bid four wide, forged command nearing the
quarter pole, kept on but was no match for the winner. EMPTY ENVELOPE stalked the pace, bid between horses, but weakened slightly in the drive. CAIRO
WINNER was allowed to settle, moved with the winner five wide, but flattened once straightened for the drive. GOLDEN PHASE was unhurried, circled five
wide and finished with a belated improvement. BABY BLUE passed only the tiring ones. AFTER NOON KISSES opened clear, was collared after a half and
gave way readily once headed. YOU LOOKING AT ME was rack to place, pulled to the lead after a half, disputed the issue through the second turn and
stopped.
