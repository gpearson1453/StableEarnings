Footnotes
NOT AS LUCKY AS US stalked the pacesetter from two wide down the backside, rallied in upper stretch while angling inside the drifting leader, dueled to
deep in the lane and pulled clear late. KALINBA set the pace on a well rated lead, responded when challenged in upper stretch while drifting out and could
not go with the winner. ICETECA tracked the leaders from three wide through the turn and failed to gain in the stretch. OVER THE BORDER rated in
mid-pack through the turn and showed late interest to be gaining late. HIGHJUMP CHARLIE rallied into the turn from the back of the field and flattened out,
tiring through the stretch. DANCE DELILAH flashed speed to be prominent for three-eighths and dropped back into the turn and stopped. PER RULING
FROM HIWU, NOT AS LUCKY AS US WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

drive to prove best. COLLEGE TRY vied for the lead two wide, made a three wide bid off the turn to draw clear by the furlong marker but was denied late to
just miss. LA VILLAGE LUMIERE chased the early pace on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied but was out-kicked late. BESSIE
BLUE was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and passed the tiring rivals. REAL MIKEY vied for the lead on the inside and weakened in the
drive. RIVER CITY ROCKER was five wide into the first turn, settled three wide and tired. HOPEFUL CURE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the
pace three wide and tired. UNFETTERED DIVA was reserved early and failed to respond.

DOZEN DIAMONDS stalked the pace down the backside, swept up three wide in the turn to readily take command in upper stretch and drew off as much
best. TIDBIT prompted the pace for the first five-eighths, moved up two wide to briefly take the lead, ran-on through the lane as second best while no match
for the winner. WAIT FOR TOMORROW settled in hand near the back of the field, rallied wide in the turn, angled in down the lane and was along for the
show. JASSAI tracked the leaders throughout and finished evenly lacking a response. LITTLE MUSIC headstrong early while racing on the lead, failed to
respond to challenge and weakened in the lane. WHITE HEAT tracked the pace from the rail for the first half mile and faded. MATRYOSHKA trailed as a
non-factor.

Footnotes
MOMOS was allowed to settle early on the inside, came off the rail leaving the turn, split rivals by the furlong marker and drew away in the final sixteenth to
prove much the best. WHERE IS MIKE was allowed to settle early, two to three wide on the turn, steadied by the three sixteenths marker, angled out and
finished well on the outside to gain the place award. LET'S GO ALAMO chased the pace on the inside, angled out in the lane and finished willingly to just
miss the place award. REBEL POSSE chased the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into th lane and had no kick, outfinished for the
place award. PERUVIAN LUCKY was reserved early and had a belated rally on the inside. S. MUFFIN set a fast pace on the inside and drew clear leaving
the turn but weakened the final sixteenth. CLASSICSTATEOFMIND pressed the pace two wide and stopped.

Footnotes
BACKWOODS BOOGIE rated in mid-pack for the first half along the rail, gained ground in the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and finished well in a
determined drive. CASTAGNO unhurried early to be near the back of the field, rallied in upper stretch finding his best stride late in the going to be gaining at
the wire. VINTNER prompted the early pace through the first turn, moved up to duel on the lead down the backside, responded turning for home and kept on
gamely through the lane. CITY PLAN stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up on the turn to duel on the lead assuming command briefly and
weakened down the lane. FLY FLY AWAY bump mildly leaving the gate, was well placed throughout and lacked a closing response when called upon.
COUNT FROST never menaced. CLOSER LOOK trailed most of the way as a non-factor. LIGHTNING JACK sped to the lead early on, battled down the
backside on the pace, began to weaken in the turn and jumped the shadow of the light pole at the quarter pole and was wrapped up from there.

Footnotes
DULCE KIARA tracked the pace from the rail through the turn, lost some position while holding ground along the fence, angled to the clear in upper stretch
and closed with a determined rush. LADY IN HEELS rated just off the pace into the turn, ranged up to take the lead in upper stretch and finished gamely
while outkicked by the winner. LILLY SIMONE rated in mid-pack down the backside, circled up to threaten turning for home and finished willingly. SIX FEET
APART sped off to a clear lead through the turn and could not hold on down the stretch. ALL ABOUT KATHERN settled off the early pace and split horses
down the lane in a mild bid. AWESOME APEAL well placed down the backside along the fence in striking distance and faded turning for home. CHARGINA
reserved near the rear of the field and passed tiring rivals in the lane. GOLDEN ISLE tracked the early leaders to the turn, made a bid to the top of the lane
and flattened out in the drive. VACATION SECRET was never a threat. AUDREY trailed throughout.

Footnotes
GOSPEL WAY was hard held early on the inside, then was two wide on the backstretch while under a hold, then was three wide by the quarter pole while
advancing, made a four wide bid off the turn and shook clear by the sixteenth marker and then held on late to prove best, driving. DYNA MAST was
reserved early on the inside, made a two wide bid off the turn, but was blocked by the furlong marker, angled out for racing room and closed fast to just
miss. SUBURBAN PRINCE was reserved two wide, came five wide into the lane and finished well. LIGHTNING RIDGE vied for the early lead two wide,
then ran off on the first turn and opened up to be clear entering the backstretch and moved to the inside, then was headed off the turn and gave way
grudgingly in the lane. GRANDPA'S KID was settled back early on the inside, then finished well on the inside. MOON SIGN vied for the early lead on the
inside, then rated off the lead, made a two wide bid off the turn to vie for command by the furlong marker and faded late.

Footnotes
ANGIE FROM KULM broke alertly, sped off to a well rated first quarter, opened a clear advantage through the turn and just held at the wire. ALL I WANT IS
YOU saved ground while reserved off the pace along the rail saving all the ground, angled four wide at the top of the lane, idled behind horses in upper
stretch and closed when clear with a rush to just miss. LITTLE JOSIE WALES reserved early along the rail, moved up in the turn along the fence, tipped out
three wide to mount a rally turning for home and finished willingly. EVERY TIME stalked the pace to the quarter pole, made a threatening move in upper
stretch and was out-kicked in the drive. CASSLEBLACK unhurried for the first three-eighths to be near the rear and made a late gain without impact.
PRACTICAL MISS slow early on and passed weakening rivals to show late interest. SMARTY PANTS never seriously menaced. CURLING ROSE
prompted the pace to be well positioned to upper stretch and tired down the lane. BACK OFF ME raced in mid-pack through the turn, made a mild bid in the
stretch and flattened out. HUMOR SENSE well placed in the early going three wide and failed to respond when called upon. KIMSFAVORITESTORM slow
early and was never a factor. PONDERED tracked the leaders for a half mile and came up empty.

Footnotes
GO POKE THE BEAR was keen early to set the pace while clear, then turned back the bid from BRIGHT EYED GIRL and kicked clear in the final furlong to
prove best under a drive. BRIGHT EYED EAGLE (IRE) was reserved early, made a outside bid to loom boldly off the turn, but was turned back in the final
furlong by the winner while staying on to be clearly second best. HOOROO (IRE) chased the early pace and lacked the needed winning bid while getting on
for the show award. SEISMIC WAVE tracked the pace throughout but had no kick in the lane and lost the show award late. WHISKY WARRIOR was
reserved early and had a mild belated rally. SEIZING THE DREAM was settled back early and failed to menace. POTUS failed to respond. DURRAGH
(IRE) was settled early and stopped.
