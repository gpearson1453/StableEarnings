SELF SERVING settled well off the pacesetter while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid from along the inside entering the
final turn, and closed willingly from just off the rail in the drive to get up in time. EARS TO US away alertly and rushed to a clear lead while racing out from
the rail entering the first turn, increased his advantage in the run down the backstretch, maintained a big lead through the final turn while drifting out leaving
the turn, and continued to drift to the middle of the track in the lane, and just failed to last. EH TEE EM unhurried early while trailing the field into the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and improved his position in the lane while finishing at the rail. THREE DAY BENDER stalked the
leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep in contact with the pacesetter in the run to the final turn, and weakened over
the final furlong. CHAMPIOSA broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied two
wide entering the final turn, but faded in the late stages. Upon returning to be unsaddled, it was reported that CHAMPIOSA bled. The three quarter split for
this race was HAND TIMED.

KAY'S KITCHEN broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and in the run
down the backside, maintained her advantage through the final turn, drifted five wide in the lane, but held ZETAMARIE safely at bay to prove best.
ZETAMARIE away alertly and tracked the pacesetter two wide entering the stretch the first time, maintained a stalking trip in the run down the backside and
into the final turn, was never a serious threat late but finished determinedly two wide in the drive in a solid effort. IRISH LUNA tracked the leader into the
stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, dropped back to trail in the run down the backstretch while taken in hand, and was pulled up leaving the
final turn. IRISH LUNA walked off after the race under her own power.

TEXAS HUMOR away well and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two wide into the backstretch, began to advance three wide midway
down the backside to gain a tracking trip approaching the final turn, rallied three wide through the turn, and closed willingly three wide in the drive to get up
in the final strides to prevail. NINE OCLOCK CEASER tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in
the run to the final turn, took command entering the final turn, and just failed to last. TAM TRICKY broke sharply, but bobbled in the opening strides before
racing into a stalking trip from along the inside entering the backstretch, rallied two wide through the final turn and finished with late interest three wide in the
drive to garner a share. TIZ THE PROSPECT away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the
inside of NINE OCLOCK CEASER in he run to the final turn, was unable to match strides with her pace rival entering the turn and steadied slightly when put
in tight quarters by that rival, and was outfinished over the final furlong. PEACEHAVEN unhurried early and trailed the field into the backstretch, was always
well back and failed to make an impact. Following the running of this race there was a jockey's objection. The rider of TIZ THE PROSPECT lodged a claim
of foul against the rider of NINE OCLOCK CEASER, for alleged interference entering the final turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no
change was made to the original order of finish.

down the backside and widened his advantage over the final furlong while under confident handling. DAPPER DON was squeezed at the start and dropped

Footnotes
STAY FANTASTIC away well and was allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground along the inside rallied smartly two wide entering
the final turn, overtook the pacesetter midway through the turn, and was all out to hold off WISELY PLAYED late to prevail. WISELY PLAYED settled off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, launched his bid two wide entering he final turn, and found his best stride late
while closing four wide in the drive to just miss. STORMY BLUE away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of JOSE JOSE through the stretch the
first time, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside and into the final turn, was overtaken midway through the turn, and faded late
in a game effort. PRINCE CAIRO was unprepared and hopped at the start to get away poorly, trailed the field through the second turn and in the run down
the backside, saved ground while commencing his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and improved his position late while finishing four wide in
the drive. JOSE JOSE broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from the inside of
STORMY BLUE in the run down the backstretch, struggled to match strides with that rival entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. CAB
SAV tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing just out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch, but
began to weaken entering the final turn while racing two out from the rail, and had nothing to offer late.
