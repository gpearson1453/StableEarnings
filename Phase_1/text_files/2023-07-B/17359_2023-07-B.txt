Footnotes
WILDWOOD POSSE vied for the early lead from outside, was three wide on the bend, fanned out further into the lane, exchanged bumps with GOLDICAT
just inside the eighth pole and edged ahead nearing the wire. GOLDICAT disputed the pace in close quarters between horses on the backstretch, came into
the lane from path three, drifted out some midstretch bumping WILDWOOD POSSE, was bumped by the latter a few strides after that, altered in some,
battled on even terms to the waning yards then gradually yielded. GHAALEB'S CITY fractious in the gate, was taken out then reloaded, broke alertly, was
hustled along from inside, floated out some entering the lane, moved clear of the others but wore down inside the last eighth. MOON PIES IMAGE unruly in
the gate, raced in contention from inside, did not keep up leaving the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and only made up minor ground in the late
going. SHINE DOWN was an early factor from outside, angled in beside MOON PIES IMAGE into the turn, swung out to path five into the stretch and
steadily gave way. There was a stewards' inquiry into the bumping between GOLIDCAT and WILDWOOD POSSE inside the last furlong and the rider of
GOLIDCAT lodged an objection alleging interference from WILDWOOD POSSE. After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.

Footnotes
SHANGHAI SILVER steadily altered in trying to keep a clear path inside STORMIN EL PRADO after leaving the chute, was caught in tight quarters between
rivals with a half mile to go, edged ahead two wide on the bend, moved clear inside the last furlong and narrowly outlasted FUTURE VISION. The latter was
squeezed between horses after the first sixteenth of a mile, prompted the pace just off the inside, lost his path on the turn, altered out four wide midway on
the bend, rallied the final eighth, lugged in some deep stretch and had to settle for second best. WARNING LABEL also squeezed after travelling the first
sixteenth, altered in some, clipped CALL ME DROSSEL'S heels, was steadied, altered out some, had the inside on the turn, swung out some for the drive,
altered out five wide upper stretch, rallied belatedly the last furlong but caught STORMIN EL PRADO for third. STORMIN EL PRADO broke in stride,
steadily angled in once on the main track, was overtaken after a furlong, three wide through the bend and gradually wore down the last eighth. COPPER
CROSSING in close quarters between horses leaving the chute, altered to the outside before finishing a furlong, advanced two wide on the bend, fanned
out further entering the lane, angled out to path six for racing room upper stretch and showed a willingness to run late. CALL ME DROSSEL quickly
overcame being bumped at the start, took the advantage after a furlong, was overtaken from outside on the turn and gave way the last quarter mile. I CAN'T
TELL YA broke inward, bumping CALL ME DROSSEL, was an early factor just off the rail, angled to the outside with a half mile to go and steadily faded
widest on the bend. FINE GRAYDAR hesitated at the break and was always outrun.

Footnotes
LIL BIT TIPSEY pressed LIFE OF SATURDAYS from just inside, gained the rail midway on the backstretch, did not keep up on the bend, swung outside the
latter for the stretch run, was all out and got up in time. LIFE OF SATURDAYS was quickly clear, showed the way from path three, challenged nearing the
end of a quarter mile, drew clear again into the turn, moved to the rail, floated out to path three entering the lane, was also all out in the late going but had to
settle for second best. LINDALOUIMAGE forwardly placed from outside on the backstretch, did not stay close three wide on the bend, lost ground fanning
out five wide for the drive, lacked a serious stretch bid but gained third inside the last furlong. WITCHING in contention early along or just off the inside,
advanced in tight quarters along the rail nearing the end of a half mile, fought for third in the stretch but did not have enough left inside the final eighth.
ALMAFUERTE was prominent between rivals on the backstretch but faded two wide on the bend. NEXT TIME YOU WIN hesitated then made a slight leap
from the gate, soon helped prompt the pace between horses, did not keep up two wide on the turn, fanned out further for the drive and steadily gave way.

GO MADI GO hesitated at the break, was settled inside, picked up her pace two wide on the bend, rallied just off the inside in the lane and caught SAY
CHEESE in the final strides. SAY CHEESE moved outside DELIGHTFUL BREEZE after a furlong, went for the lead on the turn, was carried out to path five
entering the stretch, took the lead inside the final furlong but had to settle for second best. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE moved clear after travelling a furlong and
took the inside, came off the rail some on the bend, was challenged from outside, floated out to path four into the lane and slowly wore down between rivals
inside the last eighth. AROSE FOR LYLA was soon well back, began to close the gap from along the rail on the turn, swung out three wide entering the
stretch, angled outside DELIGHTFUL BREEZE inside the last furlong and found best stride too late. ICY RIVER fractious in the gate prestart, shook her
head a couple times when the gate opened and left the gate several lengths behind GO MADI GO, advance from outside, angled in on the bend, gave way
after a half mile and gradually drifted out as she faded in the lane. There was a stewards' inquiry into ICY RIVER'S start. It was determined that ICY RIVER
was prepared to race with the rest of the field when the gate opened and the stewards took no other action

TALIS PARK GRAD soon vied for the early lead from outside, edged ahead from between rivals after two furlongs, was two wide on the bend, moved clear
upper stretch, gradually drifted out despite right-handed pressure but maintained full control. NOT AGAIN JACKIE brushed a couple times with STUMP at
the start, moved outside TALIS PARK GRAD early on, lost ground four wide through the turn, fought for second outside STUMP inside the last furlong and
edged ahead for the place in time. STUMP brushed a few times with NOT AGAIN JACKIE at the break, pressed the pacesetters on the backstretch, was
three wide taking the bend, battled for second inside the final eighth but was narrowly outfinished for second money. D' YANK in contention early while not
far off the inside, came into the stretch from just off the rail and rallied belatedly the last furlong. SHANGHAI POINT displayed early speed from inside but
gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
PAPA ROCKET without early speed, took the rail into the bend, split rivals two wide nearing the quarter pole, floated out a bit as he gained the lead inside
the final furlong, soon moved clear, kept a straight path, began to wear down deep stretch but held on under steady handling. MON AMI FUZZIE in
contention between horses on the backstretch, did not keep up three wide on the turn, began to fan out approaching the end of a half mile, came five wide
into the stretch, made a strong move the final eighth but came up short. TONYS MORNING LINE was an early factor from outside, also did not stay close
while four to six wide taking the bend, surged just outside MON AMI FUZZIE deep stretch and narrowly missed for second. MKAR THE FAST prominent
behind the leader on the backstretch, retreated two wide on the turn, also began to float out nearing the quarter pole, was four wide entering the lane,
angled in some upper stretch, moved in some again to keep a clear path inside the last furlong and showed a willingness to run late. FASTNFURIOUS soon
had the lead, showed the way just off the inside, drifted out to path four into the stretch and gradually wore down the final eighth. CRANKSHAFT well placed
early from inside, wore down for the drive. TAP'S BIG SHOT was loose without his rider during the warmup, was void of speed, though hustled along, when
the race began, was well off the inside taking the bend and did not respond to urging in the stretch.

Footnotes
MY LITTLE TIPSY a step slow at the break, bore in, bumped hard with KING TITO'S rear, circled horses four wide on the bend, angled in some nearing the
quarter pole, took the lead leaving that marker, moved clear upper stretch and held sway under steady urging. KING TITO bobbled inward at the start
bumping ROAD GAME, was then bumped solidly from the rear, recovered to be just off the pace between foes, was checked off PRINCE OF MAYHEM'S
heels while boxed in with a half mile to go, progressed three wide on the turn, fanned out some for the stretch run, took over second nearing the final
sixteenth, gradually lugged in through the waning yards and was too late. ROAD GAME was bumped at the start, raced in contention from inside, squeezed
through a narrow path two wide between rivals deep stretch and got up for third near the wire. PRINCE OF MAYHEM disputed the pace just off the inside
on the backstretch, gained the rail on the bend, could not hold MY LITTLE TIPSY back entering the stret and slowly floated out as he began to wear down
inside the final furlong. BACKSHOT pressed the early pace from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn, squeezed between MY LITTLE TIPSY
and PRINCE OF MAYHEM at the quarter pole, was steadied, came three wide into the lane, gradually angled out deep stretch and made up minor ground.
W W RUSSIAN GOLD void of early speed, picked up his pace under urging after a quarter mile, stayed off the inside taking the bend, came into the lane
from path four, drifted out upper stretch, kept a straight path the last furlong and was closing the gap late. IT'S BELLAMY TIME displayed early speed
outside PRINCE OF MAYHEM but began to fade between horses before finishing a half mile. SOME DUDE hesitated then broke in the air and was always
outrun. There was a stewards' inquiry into the start of the race but no action was taken after their review.
