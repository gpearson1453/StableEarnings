Footnotes
RISKY SPIRIT was hustled along to dispute the pace outside RUNNING WATER, under steady urging in the lane and drew off inside the final eighth.
RUNNING WATER was sent to contest the pace from inside, did not have enough left the last furlong but proved easily second best. TIGGER ATTACK
chased from outside, was two wide on the bend, angled to the outside upper stretch and moved clear for third in the waning yards. BELLA FRANCESCA
made a slight leap as she bore inward at the start, bumped solidly with RARE BEAUTY, saved ground, vied for third briefly for third deep stretch but could
not sustain her bid late. JILL ATTACK stumbled a few strides from the gate, chased the top pair briefly while in path three through the turn then gave way for
the stretch run. RARE BEAUTY unruly in the gate, was forced in once the race began, checked behind traffic and always outrun.

last furlong, crowded as he took the advantage seventy yards out and moved clear in the waning yards. JACK VAN BERG shared the lead outside
WINGING WAYS, moved clear and stayed just off the rail on the turn, began to wear down inside the final eighth, drifted out to brush with LITTLE MIGHTY
MAN seventy yards out and continued to gradually yield. TIME HEIST angled out on the turn, lost ground fanning to path five entering the lane, rallied
belatedly but was easily best of the others. KARAYEL chased from between horses, came into the stretch from path four and only make up minor ground
late. PERFECT WAGER chased running widest through and also made up minor ground the final furlong. WINGING WAYS displayed early speed from

DELTA LADY vied for the early lead outside UNEEKY, took a slight advantage into the bend, moved clear upper stretch, gradually drifted out as she began
to wear down the final furlong but kept ROARINGLIKETHUNDER at bay. ROARINGLIKETHUNDER moved out widest midway on the backstretch, went for
the lead outside DELTA LADY into the turn, did not stay with that one upper stretch, gradually angled out as DELTA LADY came out the last eighth, steadily
closed the gap but came up short. BULU prominent between rivals early, angled out four wide on the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch.
UNEEKY was sent to dispute the pace inside rivals but began to slowly yield after three furlongs. HUQOOQ chased from off the inside and was never a
factor. WHITE CASHEL a step slow at the break, failed to menace in a ground-saving trip.

MODAZZLE was sent to get the inside and share the lead with LORD SHAFTESBURY, moved clear on the bend, floated out some entering the lane,
widened command under urging and was kept to task to the final seventy yards. I'M YOUR VALENTINE closed the gap three wide on the turn, moved clear
for second upper stretch then could only maintain control of the place in the late going. PLAIN OR PEANUT was away slowly, gradually progressed from
outside, lost ground four wide through the turn, made up ground on the top pair the last eighth and proved easily best of the others. MARY'S BOY, whose
jockey did not carry a riding crop, was without much early speed, though urged along, saved ground and failed to menace. LORD SHAFTESBURY
displayed early speed from outside but began to fade two wide on the bend.

Footnotes
FAST CROSS TRAFFIC briefly in tight quarters while rated on the front end from inside, did not stay with RUN THE TABLE after two furlongs, was roused
just off the inside on the bend, all out deep stretch and got up in time. RUN THE TABLE shared the early lead just outside FAST CROSS TRAFFIC, moved
clear after a quarter mile, put to urging upper stretch, did not have enough left in the waning yards but was easily second best. ITS MAMBO hesitated then
bore in at the break, chased the top pair while well off the inside, came into the lane from path three and could only just hold onto third late. TEMPLE FOOL
was away slowly, void of speed though urged along, just off the rail taking the bend, angled outside ITS MAMBO inside the final furlong and showed a
willingness to run deep stretch. GRAYHOP was away very slowly, showed little, though urged along and distanced himself from the rest in the lane and was
walked off after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
TWO COOKIE RULE settled toward the outside, gradually closed the gap on the backstretch, gradually angled in as he circled rivals on the second bend,
moved clear into the lane, lengthened command under urging upper stretch and maintained control while kept to task until near the wire. LONESOME
DREAM exchanged bumps with AWESOME WILLY at the start, was prominent just off the inside, steadied in tight quarters between rivals into the second
turn, fanned out widest for the stretch run, gradually drifted out as he rallied and got up for second in the final strides. ORBITAL STARR unhurried along the
rail, picked up his pace after a half mile, swung around GHREAT PLAINES at the quarter pole, surged from inside in the lane and caught AWESOME
WILLY for third near the wire. AWESOME WILLY exchanged bumps with LONESOME DREAM at the break, quickly recovered to vie for the early lead from
inside, was no match for TWO COOKIE RULE after six furlongs, came off the rail some upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick and was outfinished from
both sides in the waning yards. GREAT PLAINES displayed early speed from outside, began to fade three wide before finishing five furlongs, distanced
himself in the stretch and was walked off after crossing the wire.

Footnotes
TRIPLE SCOUT gradually angled in as she vied for the lead outside rivals from the early going, was three wide on the bend, came two wide into the stretch
and shook off LONG TALL WOMAN nearing the final sixteenth. LONG TALL WOMAN bumped with DOROTA leaving the chute, soon disputed the pace
between horses, bumped MISS WINDY SLEW nearing the half mile pole, vied in tight quarters from that point until just past the quarter pole, gained the rail
into the lane and gradually wore down inside the last eighth. I LUV THIS BAR vied for the lead between rivals from the start, was caught in tight quarters just
inside LONG TALL WOMAN into the bend, gained the rail soon after, began to retreat nearing the end of a half mile, swung out to path four leaving the turn
and could only stay clear for third late. DOROTA bumped with LONG TALL WOMAN leaving the chute, was taken outside, advanced four wide on the turn,
lost further ground floating out to path six entering the lane and had no late bid. BETHY was hustled along to contest the pace from inside on the
backstretch but began to yield with three furlongs to go. MISS WINDY SLEW displayed early speed between rivals, was bumped and shuffled back nearing
the end of two furlongs and steadily gave way. The rider of LONG TALL WOMAN lodged an objection alleging repeated interference from TRIPLE SCOUT.
After their review, the stewards did not uphold that claim of foul.
