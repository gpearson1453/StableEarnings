TOMBI raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the turn then moved out to four wide in the stretch and made a late rally to be up in the final
jump. GEE WHIZ WHO was off the pace while racing three wide, inherited the lead at the eighth pole but was out finished. FERRARI ROAD tracked the
leaders through the turn from the two path then was taken up to try to avoid fallen rival but had to jump that one, lost irons and was along for show. POLICY
LIMIT had no speed through the turn and improved position in the stretch. FROGGY raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then made a three wide bid
on the turn but was taken up to try to avoid the fallen rival but had to jump that one and jogged in. WILLIE THE MAN was roused to the front to set most of
the pace, fell nearing the eighth pole and was vanned off. STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED INTO THE RUNNING NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE AFTER
A REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

with outside rival to deep stretch and weakened but was a clear second. RIGHT TO SUE tracked the leaders from the three path while racing evenly and
held on for the show. TREASURE COAST saved ground while chasing the leaders then made a rail bid in the stretch to improve his position. PICK A LANE
FRANK had no speed then moved out to three wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. BRAVO KOLT raced in the middle of the pack from the two
path then moved out to five wide in upper stretch but lacked the late response. J P'S WEST ACRES was off the pace through the turn while racing wide
throughout.

Footnotes
RONAMO was off the pace in the early stages then moved between horses at the five furlong marker to take command nearing the half mile marker and
pulled away to prove best. HOLD TIGHT was allowed to settle down the backstretch then moved between horses nearing the quarter pole but was no match
for the winner and was a clear second. TUFF WILLY TE went to an early pressured lead to the five furlong marker then tracked the leader through the turn,
was weakening but held on for the show. TW SKIPPING STONES prompted the pace to the five furlong marker then tracked the leaders through the turn
and flattened out. I SEE CLEARLY NOW was close up to mid turn and dropped back. JU JU GUY was off the pace to the top of the stretch and tired.
SHINING SOURCE raced five wide to the middle of the turn and was not a factor.
