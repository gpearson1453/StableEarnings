MANTAKETHEBLESINGS chased off the pace inside, angled out in the lane and wore down pair of leaders in the late stages. ADDYSON'S DREAM
advanced wide on the turn, led briefly and finished gamely. WHISKEYROMEOSIERRA rushed to the front into the far turn, moved briefly clear, was
challenged and held on well. LOST AND CONFUSED chased wide throughout and lacked a rally. CLANCY O'TOOLE raced greenly in the opening quarter,
made a brief bid inside then faded. WE GOT BARNYARD broke poorly, moved very wide then gave way. LORD ON HYGH flashed speed inside then began
fading on the turn. ZONA DE AMIGOS dropped back early and was always outrun. JIGGERY POKERY was ordered a late scratch while in the paddock.
