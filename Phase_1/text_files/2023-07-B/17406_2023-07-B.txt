DON'T STOP DREAMIN stalked the early leader, took command on the turn and widened under light handling through the stretch. BREACH OF TRUST
was away alertly and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. LETS SAY THIS was in touch and
roused on the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had no response. CATRIN was well back, showed nothing and was never in contention.
INFINITELY KATZ was hustled early but lost ground on the turn and was empty.

turn and from the seven path at the top of the stretch finished well. RADCLIFFE was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the three path at the top of

up for show. SEVEN IS A BREEZE was well back and gained ground on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch evened out. ONE MORE

little and was never in contention. THY KINGDOM showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. SAME AGAIN DOC was up close
