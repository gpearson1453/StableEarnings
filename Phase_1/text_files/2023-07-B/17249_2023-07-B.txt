Footnotes
TALKIN PHAROAH dropped back off the pace then came under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch, closed well
to get the lead into the final furlong, disposed of the runner-up under a left-handed crop shortly thereafter and drew clear under strong urging. WIN FOR
GOLD dueled on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that opponent on the turn, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole, was roused for
more into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner under the crop into the final furlong and proved no match while just able to hold the place. SUGAR
GRAY LEONARD was ridden along off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out while gaining inside the three-sixteenths, chased
outside into the final furlong and flattened out then just missed the place but was well clear for the show. TOMMY GUN was hustled from the gate then
ridden along off the pace, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, spun back into the two path entering the stretch and failed to threaten.
CHARLIE FIVE O settled on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn and was no factor. EAST COAST GIRL dueled on
the outside of a foe, vied in the two then three path on the turn, dropped back nearing the quarter-pole and faded.

EPIC MISS JUSTICE three then two wide through the first turn, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths stacked outside a
trio just in behind the top pair, swung five wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close in and was just up in a blanket finish on the wire. WHY
WASTE WORDS coaxed from the gate, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into
upper stretch, offered up a good finish closing fastest of all late, got bumped steps from the wire by KING'S SECRET looking to thread a space inside her
between foes and just missed at the end. KING'S SECRET (GB) tracked along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had no clear lane in front, tipped out three paths to a seam between EPIC MISS JUSTICE and WHY
WASTE WORDS, bumped with WHY WASTE WORDS in the final jumps when trying to split those rivals and missed at the finish. BEST PERFORMER
forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, dueled in hand three then two wide with VANISHED to her inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, shook away briefly a furlong out, then dug in under threat from a host of rivals and was nailed
when overwhelmed late. NO DELI (IRE) just off the inside tracking the pair up front in closest aim, came under coaxing bidding at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes through the final furlong and was outfinished in the late stages when running on to the wire.
HEAVENLY APPOINTED chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
bid but was outkicked in the late going. HOLA GATA four wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide offering up a bid near the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide for home unable to sustain the momentum and weakened through to the finish. TACITURN two to three wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing three to four wide at the three-eighths, angled inwards to the two path at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered
no response. ISOLA (IRE) grew rank under restraint early on along the inside near the rear of the field skygazing before settling into the first turn, chased
along the inside and then just off the inside, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact when never fully engaged by the rider.
VANISHED dueled inside of BEST PERFORMER while under rating, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and
tired. PARIS STYLE (FR) two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
WHITEBEAM (GB) broke in and brushed the gate then bumped lightly with a foe, was taken under a snug hold while moving forward early, tucked into the
two path for most of the first turn then shifted to the three path, stalked the leader on the outside down the backstretch, turned up the pressure in the three
path on the far turn, was roused outside the quarter-pole then came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, fought on even terms for the lead while
outside the runner-up into the final furlong, was brushed by that foe near the sixteenth-pole, continued the tussle to the finish and got up on the line to
narrowly prevail. IN ITALIAN (GB) came away in good order and went straight to the front, showed the way in the two path, was asked at the top of the
stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the eighth-pole, battled inside the winner into the final furlong, drifted out near the sixteenth-pole and
brushed with that foe, led under a drive to the final stride but was denied while able to hold the place. FEV ROVER (IRE) became very fractious in the gate,
was backed out and deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian then reloaded, was rated just off the pace on the inside, came under urging on the final turn,
turned into the stretch in the two path, angled out behind the top two in the vicinity of the furlong marker, gained with good courage late and finished willingly
but missed while well clear for the show. MARKETSEGMENTATION bumped lightly with a rival at the start while last away then moved out while taken in
hand, lost touch quickly with the top three, traveled around the opening bend in the two path, was reserved towards the back, went two then three wide
under urging on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. FLUFFY SOCKS was restless in the gate, bumped
lightly with foes at the start, moved in over heels while taken in hand early, was reserved at the rear while saving ground, raced under urging on the far turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and failed to rally.

Footnotes
PLAYLIST coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside from just off the pace, slipped three wide at the head of the stretch roused for the drive, rallied to
take command nearing the eighth pole, dug in under threat swapping lead changes and racing a bit erratic late while gamely holding to the finish. BOWL OF
CHERRIES just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
issue a challenge through the final furlong, dug in under a drive fighting on to the finish but was ultimately staved off. BREEZE EASY (GB) came under a
firm hold chasing three to four wide down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and remained on hold until lightly coaxed swinging four wide into
upper stretch, got taken in hand on pause straightened away in behind LADY MILAGRO unable to alter out with a rival passing in that lane, tipped out near
the eighth pole and was roused at that station after BOWL OF CHERRIES cleared to the outside and ran on to secure the show honors. GLITTER UP
prompted the pace of BOMBDIGGITY from the two path coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch taking over
command, dug in under threat and was collared just outside the eighth pole, weakened in the late stages. LADY MILAGRO lunged at the start getting away
last and conceding two to three lengths to the front, advanced to chase four then three wide in aim of the top pair, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late going. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY three wide in pursuit, got lightly and
briefly coaxed angled five wide into upper stretch, tired in the stretch. BOMBDIGGITY hustled from the gate, showed the way coaxed along the inside under
pressure from GLITTER UP, yielded the front taking the inside route at the quarter pole, then tired through to the finish.

ICHIBAN broke out at the start, pressed then stalked the pace on the outside, ranged up in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, took
the lead outside the quarter-pole then moved clear, was challenged by the runner-up in upper stretch, responded well when put to a left-handed crop
coming to the furlong marker, disposed of the runner-up near the sixteenth-pole, switched to a right-handed crop in the final sixteenth and prevailed under
good handling. FOXY CARA was urged along off the pace, chased in the five path on the turn, gained near the five-sixteenths, made an outside bid in upper
stretch, fought on even terms with the winner into the final furlong, was turned away near the sixteenth-pole and outfinished while well clear for the place.
BON ADIEU settled off the pace, was asked while two then three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and narrowly earned the show while
no match for the top two. MIM was forwardly placed on the outside, chased four wide on the turn and tired. ISLAND ROSE settled well back in the field,
traveled five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KRYSTALHEIR settled off the pace, was urged along late on the
backstretch, went three wide under extra left-rein pressure on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and was no factor. SWEET LIBERTY brushed with a
foe early, set the pace under pressure, vied in the two path for most of the turn, dropped to the rail while losing the lead late on that bend and gave way.
MONTAUK MYSTIQUE was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back while inside early on the turn, moved to the
two path late on that bend and capitulated. SHOTGUN PATSY settled off the pace, moved out late on the backstretch, was roused three then four wide on
the turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. EMBRACEABLE GAL bobbled slightly after the start then lacked early speed, angled
out near the five-eighths pole then reached the outside of the field, rounded the turn in the six path and trailed.

sixteenth out and herding CITY FEVER a path before being nailed by a pair in the final strides to the finish. CIGARETTE BOAT hustled from the gate,
showed the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch, floated to the two path at the seven-sixteenths forcing FLAT TOP BOX to steady at that
