Footnotes
DREAMLIKE saved ground on the first turn, settled while well spotted down the backstretch, drafted in the two path for most of the far turn, was roused
while shifting four wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch then came in some while moving clear, extended the advantage into the
final furlong and drew away under steady urging. MOORE'S LAW brushed with a foe at the start, was taken in hand early, traveled around the first turn in
the two path, fell well behind on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, angled out into upper stretch and was along for the place. MOUNT CRAIG
stumbled awkwardly at the start and was last to commence, saved ground on the first turn, tossed his head while tugging on the bit inside the three-quarter
pole, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the far turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner under a drive to make a
bid into upper stretch, was bumped solidly by HERO'S MEDAL near the three-sixteenths then steadied some, lost touch with the winner outside the furlong
marker, battled with the aforementioned opponent for the show to the finish and just earned that position. HERO'S MEDAL went to the front, showed the
way while inside to the two path, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, spun into the stretch in the two path under a drive, came in some and bumped
solidly with MOUNT CRAIG near the three-sixteenths, was turned in some while taken in hand, came out a bit from the reaction of the previous bumping
and bumped another foe, battled with MOUNT CRAIG to the finish for the show and just missed that position. EXUDE went three wide on the first turn,
stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, moved to the five path outside the quarter-pole, dropped back into upper stretch
and tired. OCASEK prompted the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was asked on the final turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was
bumped inside the three-sixteenths and taken in hand briefly then came up empty. RIDE UP brushed with a foe at the start, steadied while shut off by
EXUDE early, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused near the half-mile pole, traveled three wide around the far turn and failed
to respond. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY, HERO'S MEDAL WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED SIXTH FOR INTERFERENCE

the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked once straightened for the drive, was guided
in while extending the advantage in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker and held under steady urging. JUST KATHERINE

the rail on the far turn, chased the winner in upper stretch, moved out behind that foe near the furlong marker and finished willingly for the place. UNSUNG

Footnotes
EMPIRE SKY chased five wide throughout coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and closed
in inside the final furlong overhauling the embattled top pair in the final jumps to the finish to score. RUSSI hustled from the gate, dueled three wide with
HENSON to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, dug in continuing to knock heads gamely through the
stretch to the finish trading a bump near the eighth pole, then was nailed as a pair in the final jumps to the wire. HENSON struck the off side stall at the start,
dueled from the two path with the aforementioned foe to his outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole before being set down spinning just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in continuing to engage in head to head combat through the length of the stretch, the rider flashing the crop to the right side
when fighting on gamely but was nailed in concert with his main pace rival by the top one in the final strides. SCHERZANDO four wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. STREET ROD chased along the inside, scraped
the paint through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cut the corner nearly leaning on the rail into upper stretch, offered up a bid a
furlong from home, then flattened out in the late stages. WHISKEY AND WINE got bumped solidly at the start by KID KREESA into CHARMING JIM and
then got taken in hand when soon behind those foes due to the pressure, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide
into upper stretch and weakened. KID KREESA broke in at the start bumping WHISKEY AND WINE into CHARMING JIM, chased four wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CHARMING JIM got bumped at the start by WHISKEY AND WINE due to
pressure from KID KREESA chased three then two wide, came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and trailed.

Footnotes
BLUE DEVIL was coaxed to the front, raced inside on the first turn, was well rated while showing the way off the rail down the backstretch, came under
urging in the two path midway through the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, responded well in the drive and drew off under a solid hand-ride to win
ridden out. OGLETHORPE went around the opening bend in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path with three
furlongs to run, chased the winner under the crop late on the far turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and proved no match while clear for second.
ALFIO angled in nearing the first turn, saved ground going around that bend, was rated at the back of the trio, came under urging late on the backstretch,
went around most of the turn in the two path, was put to the crop outside the five-sixteenths, moved to the rail outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left.

BUSTIN SHOUT coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, traded
bumps with HEIR PORT near the eighth pole, then took command at that station and edged clear to the finish kept to task. HEIR PORT hustled from the
start, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, traded minor bumps with the aforementioned foe near that station, dug in weakening late
and just held for the place honors. HIGH TONE chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors in a blanket finish behind the winner. NO MORE
TALK coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in aim of the top pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. FIRST DEPUTY chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch, offered up a mild bid to share in the last major share with NO MORE TALK on the wire. STRIKING SPEED prompted the pace of HEIR PORT
from the outside three wide, then got joined by NO MORE TALK and loosely pressed the pace between foes through the turn under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, tired in the stretch. GANDY DANCING six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through
the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, faltered, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
THINKABOUTIT hit the outside of the gate at the start, settled on the inside, checked sharply when shut-off at the nine-sixteenths and lost position, saved
ground on the turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch the two path, angled out at the three-sixteenths, rallied while remaining on his
inside lead to make a bid into the final furlong, passed the sixteenth-pole on even terms for the front, swapped to the proper lead when pulled in by the rider
late and got up under strong handling. CEES GET DEGREES charged the front of the gate just as the latch was sprung, broke clearly in front while veering
out in front of foes, bothered several rivals in the process, lugged out while setting the early pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, lugged out under extra
left-rein pressure in the three path on the turn, responded well under the crop while taking a more straight path in the stretch, led into the final sixteenth but
was caught while able to get the place. HAPPY FARM was forced out at the start then taken up some, settled just off the pace, came in near the
nine-sixteenths and shut-off the winner, saved ground while asked on the turn, made a rail bid at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch on even terms
for the lead, fought under a drive into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. PRIME FACTOR stumbled at the start then was
taken up twice, settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, went four then five wide on the turn, was roused in the vicinity of the
five-sixteenths, chased outside in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. EMERALD FOREST was forced out at the start, tracked the pace on the outside,
was given his cue in the four path on the turn, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. NIFTY broke in and brushed with a foe, settled on
the far outside at the rear, went five wide on the turn and failed to rally. RAM brushed with a foe at the start, settled on the inside of a rival at the back, went
three to four wide on the turn and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT angled in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole and drew off
under steady urging. OUR COUNTRY went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no match for the winner. MORE THAN WORK was hustled from the gate, went around the first turn in the
two path, was well placed down the backstretch, chased in the two to three path on the far turn, came under the crop outside the quarter-pole and proved no
match for the winner then just lost the place but earned the show. INVISIBLE WAR saved ground on the first turn, was urged along at the rear, raced inside
on the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. VALENZAN DAY was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn, tracked
the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, came up empty in the four path on the far turn and faltered then was eased in the final
furlong but walked off.
