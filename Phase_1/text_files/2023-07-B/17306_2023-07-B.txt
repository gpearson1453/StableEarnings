YEAH TAKE THAT set the pressured pace off of the inside, shook clear leaving the turn, was headed a furlong out, fought back doggedly to prevail. A BIT
OF CAPTAIN prompted the pace outside, angled in entering the stretch snugging up FRIZZANTE near the seven-sixteenths pole, switched back to the
outside on the turn, poked his head in front a furlong out, battled on but was unable to best the determined winner. GRUMPY BROOKSIE settled in hand,
looped up four wide through the turn, loomed a danger entering the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong. FRIZZANTE was forwardly placed along the
inside, was caught in tight when A BIT OF CAPTAIN came in near the seven-sixteenths pole, checked losing position, churned on but failed to threaten
thereafter. ZHU DADDY brushed the gate and came away behind his field, pulled to contention between horses, but came up empty leaving the turn and
dropped out.

Footnotes
REDHOT KATIE settled saving ground while never far back, shifted out to commence her rally on the second turn, split rivals leaving the quarter pole, wore
down TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC inside the furlong marker and edged clear. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC opened clear to set the pace, was collared nearing the
furlong marker, was unable to resist the winner but fought on to preserve the place spot. SCOOP THERE IT IS hopped at the start to get away slow, was
rank to place through the first turn, leveled into stride on the backstretch, worked her way forward through the second turn off of the inside, angled to the rail
a furlong out, got through and was making up ground. CAGUA contended between runners, circled four wide into the stretch to make her bid, but failed to
sustain the drive. SUMTING RIGHT tracked three deep, moved up to engage the leader nearing the quarter pole, but came up empty between horses in the
drive and faded. JEFF'S ANGEL broke slow and was squeezed, was unhurried off of the inside but failed to respond when asked. ROLLING MO was
forwardly placed along the inside to the stretch and stopped.

ANOTHER BREEZE pulled clear to dictate terms, remained unchallenged and drew away to score with something left. CAPTAIN MAD JACK chased four
wide, was no match for the winner but kept on to prove the best of the rest. LEBASI settled off of the inside, came three wide and finished fairly well to earn
the show. CHARLIE CHARLIE was hustled along four wide, offered a mild bid entering the stretch but failed to sustain the drive. FACTORINO was forwardly
placed along the inside to the stretch and dropped out. WEEKEND IN COURT walked out of the gate, quickly dropped well back and was never a factor.

Footnotes
WILD LOOKER was nearest the pace three deep, took dead aim entering the stretch, reeled in LADY MARVEL inside the sixteenth marker and was up in
the final yards. LADY MARVEL opened clear to control the tempo, settled in the lane loose on the lead, but weakened slightly in the drive and grudgingly
gave in. TIZ PROMISING RVF was unhurried into stride, tucked in to save ground, got through and was making up ground willingly. ABBEY'S SNOW
WHITE was hustled along on the inside while never far back, shifted out entering the stretch and flattened in the drive. PLATINUM SKY contended three
wide, came four wide but faltered in the final furlong. ANNIE UP BUCK was allowed to settle, looped into the stretch five wide and made a belated
improvement. AMAZON LIZZIE settled off of the inside and lacked a response when asked. YES IT'S ERIE settled off of the inside, but came up empty
entering the lane and faded. THE TWO NANCY'S was shuffled back leaving the chute, moved up along the inside, shifted out on the turn, but was through
after a half and retreated.

Footnotes
BARNEGAT LIGHT tracked three deep, ranged up on the second turn, forged command with five-sixteenths to run, dug in to meet the challenge of
WHISKEYMAC entering the lane, shook off that one inside the furlong marker and edged clear. WHISKEYMAC was unhurried off of the inside, came under
a ride into the second turn, made a sweeping move and loomed four wide entering the stretch, was unable to go on with the winner late and settled for the
runner up spot. GREY INVASION settled off of the rail, took closer order through the second turn, came three wide but lacked the needed late response.
EPIC LUCK came away a step slow, rushed up to contest the pace outside, but came up empty after six furlongs and dropped out. BRADITUDE was away
alertly, disputed the pace along the inside, was headed midway through the second turn and gave way readily thereafter.

Footnotes
RIBBONS AND MEDALS opened clear to set the pace, dug in to meet the challenge of GET EVEN nearing the furlong marker, battled on and held
stubbornly. GET EVEN stalked the pace three deep, launched a bold bid entering the stretch, took dead aim but was unable to best the determined winner.
SAKETUMI attended the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the stretch but failed to make headway through the drive. VAN settled saving ground,
got through and finished willingly. MOONSTRIKE (GB) was allowed to settle, ranged up four wide to make a mild bid but failed to sustain the drive. E
MINOR was unhurried into stride, but passed only the tiring ones. NIGHT RIDE was hung wide through the first turn within striking distance, but came up
empty on the second turn and faded. DECEITFUL failed to respond. FLIGHT TO PARADISE went wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TEXAS GANO was a tad slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the two path into the lane, made a bid up the inside down the lane while
under a long drive and prevailed in the final stages. C THE KING raced back early on along the inside, shifted into the three path entering the lane, altered
out and in, split horses while making a bid under a long drive but did not have enough in the final stages. LEAVE 'EM LOADED dueled early on from the rail,
stayed near the rail into the lane, inched clear near the eighth pole but yielded late in the drive. SIDE TRACKED tracked the pace early, was in the four path
into the lane, made a bid down the lane but hung in the late stages. CATHMOR raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the
stretch run. KICKS ON SIXTY SIX chased the pace early, was in the five path into the lane and flattened out late in the stretch drive. FUEL THE BERN
dueled early on two wide, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but faltered late in the drive. FARAT was never a threat. GAGE HAS
A GRAY had early speed then folded up.
