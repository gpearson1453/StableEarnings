Footnotes
LITTLE BIG sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then lasted under steady pressure. ROUND OF
APPLAUSE unhurried, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled five wide into the stretch, exchanging bumps with LARZ, then made a
steady gain and missed. RICHARD HOOTY allowed to settle, angled out through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and lacked the needed late
kick, settling for the show. LARZ tracked the pace rating, raced boxed into and through the second turn, angled out and made room four wide into the
stretch, exchanging bumps, then lugged in and lacked the needed kick. GRAVE DANGER well placed and outside, held position three wide through the
second turn, bid on that path into the lane, then lugged in and could not gain in the late going. BACKDOORPARTY rated close up and outside, held position
on the two path through the second turn, then faded into the stretch.

GOVERNOR ATWOOD well placed and inside, moved up on the two path through the turn, bid on that path into stretch, angled out, made a steady gain
and drove clear. ON AN ISLAND mid pack, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed well for the
place. TWELVETWO mid pack, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and had a mild late gain. CHANGE THE HOUR
unhurried, looped three and four wide through the turn, fanned five wide into the stretch and got up for a share. LUCKY SMILE eased to the lead, drew off
into the stretch three wide, then drifted in and weakened. DOUBLE WARRIOR stalked the pace on the outside, angled in to save ground through the turn,
came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened late. MIZWARRIOR broke sharply from the gate and showed little. KVETCHING MAW well
placed and between, lost some ground on the two path through the turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened. STAR CRUISER was no factor.
FRETENSIS hopped at the start, was never involved. PER RULING 2023-00641 FROM HISA, LUCKY SMILE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 5th TO
UNPLACED DUE FOR EXCESSIVE CROP VIOLATION.

Footnotes
LONG RAP SHEET stalked the pace on the outside, shook clear through the second turn, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then came again late
to edged ahead. NATHANIEL'S HOPE well placed, moved to position on the two path through the second turn, angled in and got through inside the leader,
edged ahead of that one, then could not sustain the bid and settled for the place. FLAT BUSTED allowed to settle, moved up and was boxed on the two
path through the second turn, came through on that path, made a steady gain through traffic and closed for the show. SHAKEN AND SHIMMY rated close
up, gained position on the two path through the second turn, came three wide into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. MR. YASUDA allowed to
settle, angled out through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. BLOWN OUT bumped by both side at the start, moved up
two and three wide through the second turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved his position. VAMONOS rushed up down the backstretch, lost
some ground four wide through the turn, then faded the final furlong. MOCA MONSTER well placed and outside, faded through the second turn. SEA
CRUISE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, then faded into the stretch. POINT LOMA well placed and between rivals, faded on the two path
through the second turn.
