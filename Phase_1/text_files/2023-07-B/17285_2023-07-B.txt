TEAM GOLD DIGGER trailed early, circled rivals four wide through the turn, sustained that bid to make the lead in deep stretch two wide and won under
right handed urging. CAROL'S ROYALTY broke in front, set the pace along the inside until deep stretch and held on for second. GRAY ROYALITY stalked
pace the pace and finished determinedly in the four path. YEARS AGO stumbled badly at the start, had good early speed along the inside and lacked the
needed response. MISS OVER THERE chased the pace into the stretch then weakened. JOYFUL NOISE was no factor.
