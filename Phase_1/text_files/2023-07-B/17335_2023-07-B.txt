Footnotes
NO WASABI FOR ME bumped with UNIFIEDS PRINCESS at the start, raced in range two wide, bid three wide rounding the far turn, took over in upper
stretch and held firm under a drive. NELIDA rated off the pace two wide, angled four wide nearing the quarter pole, bid outside of the winner in upper stretch
but could not get by that foe. KITTENZEN saved ground in range, could not match strides with the top two in upper stretch but stayed on to gain the show.
UNIFIEDS PRINCESS bumped with the winner at the start, saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and improved position.
FROSTY SECRET pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole but tired in upper stretch. FAR ABOVE set the pace along the rail
and faltered in the lane. STARSHIP GIZMO played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
DIVIETO stalked in the four path, bid early into the turn, took command passing the quarter, was roused to open up around the two path into the stretch, and
went clear under a drive. LE DOM BRO brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path, was driven around the turn, and chased on from the
five path down the lane for place. SOUND OF THE BEAST prompted the pace in the three path, bid under coaxing between foes rounding the turn, but
evened out in the stretch for show. UNEQUIVOCALLY set the pace in the two path but lost the lead along the inside approaching the quarter, and faded.
DONTBESOOGROUCHY broke out and brushed with an outer foe, raced off the pace in the two path, but floated outward around the turn, and never
threatened. UNFINISHED AFFAIRS had an unprepared start, trailed in the five path early and never menaced.

Footnotes
BIG BAND LUZZIANN stalked the pace inside, came through at the rail to take over near the five-sixteenths marker, angled into the two path turning for
home and kicked clear under a drive. NIKEE KAN had early speed inside, angled three wide nearing the turn, prompted the pace three wide around the
bend and stayed on to be clearly second best in the lane. L. E. GRAY raced in range four wide, lacked the needed rally but gained the show. SONICUS
veered in at the start, raced off the pace in the two path and was one-paced through the lane. IDEAL BREEZE set the pace in the two path and weakened in
the lane. VIGIL ANNA trailed inside.

Footnotes
SAVANAH LADY dueled for the early lead along the inside, inched away from an outer foe rounding the turn, was roused to open up into the lane, and went
clear under a drive. BEAU SOLEIL vied for the early lead outside the winner in the two path, lost touch with that foe while tipping out to the four path into the
stretch, but kept on to clearly hold place. WHATS UP BUTTERCUP was behind in the six path early, received cues while in the five path rounding the turn,
fanned out to the seven path into the stretch, and moved up outside of rivals for show. FUMBLEROOSKI raced wellback in the two path, cut the corner
under a drive into the stretch, but made no impact. LAS COLINAS was pushed along in midpack around the five path but was no factor. BUCCHANERA had
a hesitant start, raced off the pace in the four path. floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and did not threaten. I LOVE VENEZUELA chased the
leading duo in the three path, but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
ANATOMY stalked in the five path, loomed from the four path rounding the turn, brushed with an inner foe while making a bid from the three path at the top
of the lane, stuck her nose in front of that inner foe while dueling passing the eighth pole, and held on. TEASING brushed with an inner foe at the start,
prompted the pace in the four path, took the lead while in the three path nearing the three eighths pole, brushed with a challenging outer foe at the top of the
stretch, ran on and dueled with that outer foe from inside down the stretch, but lost the bob to place. UNCAPTURED DOVE set the pace in the two path, lost
the lead while under a ride from the rail approaching the three eighths, but fought on from the two path down the lane to hold show. MISS BIA brushed with
an outer foe at the start, chased in the three path, tipped out to the five path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. BURNAWAY raced off the pace in
the six path, was under a drive outside of rivals around the turn, and flattened in the final furlong. VIBING trailed in the five path early and was never
involved. REE tracked inside but was empty entering the lane.

SWOONATRA set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and lasted under a drive. BATTLE CRY raced off the pace inside, gained slightly at the
rail in upper stretch, tipped out near the sixteenth pole and was rapidly gaining in the final strides. PACIFIC PRINCESS stalked the winner two wide, drifted
out turning for home then battled on between foes to hold the show. SANDPIPER MEMORIES raced in ranged three wide, was floated out six wide turning
for home then was outkicked while racing widest in the lane. LA RUSIA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. CRYSTAL COAST chased the
pace inside, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. SHE FLED THE SCENE played no factor while racing three and four wide. STREAKING GREY
hopped at the start, was pulling early, advanced four wide around the first turn, pressed the pace outside down the backstretch, chased three wide around
the far turn, steadied when in tight near the quarter pole and had no further bids.

Footnotes
READYSEEKGO bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close in the four path, bid in the three path rounding the far turn, took the lead under urging
from the four path into the stretch, and held sway. XY TIME set the pace inside, lost the lead along the rail approaching the final quarter, but fought back
inside of foes to place. POUND GREEN broke in and bumped an inner foe, raced off the pace in the six path, ranged up to bid from the four path early into
the far turn, kept on from the six path into the lane, but hung in the final furlong to show. DRILLOMATIC had his head turned at the start, raced wellback in
the three path, tipped out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and ran on between rivals. RYE SENSE OF HUMOR got pinched at the start, rated in the
five path, fanned out to the seven path into the lane, and gained late. GRANDE SOIREE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path but
made no impact from the four path in the stretch. TIMMY M. bumped with an inner foe the start, was held up in the five path but did not threaten. FAST N
STEADY stalked in the three path but backed up around the far turn.
