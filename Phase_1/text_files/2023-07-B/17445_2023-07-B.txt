FEARNOUGHT took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths
pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over RIDICULOUS, who rate close off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in gamely to the wire. HAGLER raced in the five path the first turn, picked up
the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and finished well. SARGENT KOBE raced off the rail on the opening turn,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the five path and weakened. YABBA DABBA DUDE raced in the four path the first
turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but showed little response. TEXTPECTATION was not a factor. This race was hand timed.

Footnotes
DANNY'S WINKSTER rated close off the rail, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path on the far turn, dug in through the final
furlong and took the nod under the wire. MIMS SECOND CHANCE raced with the pace while alternating the lead with FLASH OF DAY, dueled from the
three eighths pole and contested even terms two deep on the far turn, cleared that one inside the sixteenth pole but missed the nod under the wire. The
latter raced with the pace inside while alternating the lead with Mims Second Chance, dueled that one leaving the three eighths pole and contested even
terms nearest the rail on the far turn, but flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME raced off the rail on the first turn, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and ran evenly in the lane. A THOUSAND IDOLS rated close in the three path on the
opening turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride off the rail on the far turn. STRONG CURLIN dropped well back early
on. This race was hand timed. Morning Artie ran loose in the post parade and was a late scratch.

Footnotes
BLISS THIS rated close off the rail on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, took over two deep
midway on the far turn and held on under steady stretch handling. MISS YOU AJAX stumbled leaving the gate and raced in the five path the first turn,
started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, improved in the four path on the far turn and dug in to take second later yards while gaining marginally on
the winner. VOICE OF NOW took the lead past the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and relented toward mid-stretch. MUD BUG ducked out and hit the gate at the break then saved ground,
picked up the chase approaching the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and flattened inside the eighth pole. SEAN THE HAMMER
stalked from the three path on the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole but faded in the four path on the far turn. COUNTRY CHARLIE rounded
the first turn in the three path, gave chase past the half mile pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. ANVIL saved ground on the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. BOSEY saved ground on the first turn and showed little
response through the backstretch. CINCO LINKO rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded through the
