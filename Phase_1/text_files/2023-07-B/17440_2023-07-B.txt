Footnotes
MAN ON THE MOON gained forward position from the inside, advanced along the rail, found clear inside MIKE OPERATOR into second bend, reached the
front passing three-eighths marker, shook free and remained clear under steady handling. PAPALE brushed by inside foe at the start, stalked on the rail or
two wide, continued inside into the lane, pulled clear from others in the stretch and just lasted for the place. SITTIN ON GO broke out bit and brushed foe,
chased three or two wide, came out on the backstretch, made steady progress, came in some on second turn, shifted back out in upper stretch and closed
to narrowly miss second. MIKE OPERATOR stepped to the front, set pace under pressure and two wide, was overtaken passing three-eighths marker and
weakened some. SECRET TOUCH chased four wide early, continued three wide in middle stages, came four wide into the stretch and lacked rally.
MONGOLIAN KINGDOM taken in hand early, chased two wide, came out bit later, was four wide exiting last bend and no late threat. PERFECT CUT came
in bit early, chased three wide, later also came four wide entering the lane and failed to menace. KRIXUS FLASH was bit tight off heels into the first turn,
chased off the rail throughout and did not make any impact late.. CITY LEGEND settled off the pace and three wide, remained off the rail, dropped back
around the second turn and faded.

Footnotes
OUTER SUNSET took a bump and stumbled in the beginning, stalked the leaders two wide into the turn, angled out to the four path around the bend, rallied
outside the leader in deep stretch and drove past. MISS PIXY STIX got forced into outer rival at the start, went up to challenge for deep for command,
fought three deep into the lane, cleared in upper stretch and got run down by the winner late. AMERICAN TSUNAMI vied for the lead inside rivals into and
around the turn, fought to upper stretch, could not stay with the leader entering the furlong grounds and flattened to third. HIGH FLYING GRACIE broke a bit
slow and inward, trailed on the inside into the turn, saved ground passing rivals around the bend and showed a mild rally to round out the superfecta.
IFUAINTFIRSTURLAST bumped inner rival then shifted out leaving the gate, vied between rivals for the lead to the top of the stretch and weakened. FIFTY
STARS broke out, tracked six wide into the turn, seven wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run. CAPO SORELLA came out at the start, vied
for the lead three deep, started to weaken around the bend, entered the lane three to four wide and faded. THIRSTY FOR LOVE took a bump from inside at

LADY T stalked two wide into the turn, ridden along while easing three then four wide leaving the bend, fought with rivals to both sides in the lane and
inched ahead past the sixteenth pole. ANYWHO broke slow on the inside, moved into range inside a pair of rivals, tipped out around the turn, took aim three
wide entering the stretch, led into the final furlong but got outkicked by LADY T in deep stretch. TAMING THE TIGRESS broke a step slow, trailed three
wide into the turn, two wide exiting the bend, finished willingly and gained the show. MY DESTINY chased three deep into the turn, exited the bend four to
five wide, bid widest in the lane but lacked the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. DORIS MAE sped clear and set the tone in the early going, showed the
way along the rail into the lane, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
EYLARA (IRE) rated in the two path then between rivals, bid three deep late on the final turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and held well in the end.
MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER antsy in the gate, was keen early and pulled the rider along while reserved three then two wide, continued to tug in the two path
early, checked early on the last turn, angled four wide into the clear around the bend, rallied but had to settle for second best. HAPPY HAPPY hopped at the
start, trailed on the inside into the first turn then angled four wide outside rivals, went up to apply pressure to the leader from outside in the two path, fought
between foes leaving the last turn, got put in a bit tight in upper stretch, kept on through the final furlong and regained the show. UNFAITHFUL WAYS
settled inside, chased in range two then three wide approaching the stretch, tipped out to launch a bid in upper stretch but could not summon the needed
late kick. ZEYARAAT dueled from outside into the first turn then cleared inner rival and moved inside, pressured by HAPPY HAPPY up the backstretch, vied
with a pair of rivals into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) got bothered by inner rival leaving the gate,
bumped by same foe again around the first turn and clipped heels then bumped once more leaving the the bend, steered to the inside racing at the back,
angled four wide on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and could not rally. ALOHA KITTEN broke well then ceded command to ZEYARAAT early,
stalked from inside, waited for room late on the far turn, lacked room in traffic in upper stretch and weakened once in the clear. A CROWN FOR KITTEN
broke out, pulled hard along the rail and shifted out to bump rival, chased three wide around the clubhouse turn, dropped back on the final turn, eased in the
lane and walked off.

Footnotes
WARRIOR ROAD brushed leaving the gate, went up challenge from outside, cleared inner rival on the turn, fought with BENDETTIJOE leaving the turn,
dueled while drifting out in the lane and gamely prevailed. BENDETTIJOE was off slow to begin, moved into range five wide into the turn, bid three wide
leaving the bend, dueled down the lane and could not get by the winner. U R PRESSED tracked four wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide, closed
well through the lane and was gaining on the top pair to the wire. REEF CITY got bumped on both sides at the start, settled inside, went between rivals on
the turn, two wide into the lane, summoned a mild response and earned a minor award. MONTANA broke out and bumped PINEAPPLE JUICE, sat off the
pace, went two wide into the turn, angled five wide around the bend and needed to find more in the final furlong. PINEAPPLE JUICE got bumped and lost
path at the start, trailed five wide into the turn, steered out wider to race seven wide into the lane and failed to threaten. PARS AND BIRDIES broke in and
bumped rival, raced near the back outside a rival early, went four wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and could not rally. PAT CAN'T COUNT
climbed up the backstretch and traveled mid-pack three wide into the turn, chased five wide into the stretch and weakened. BIG GUN was off slow and
bumped leaving the gate, raced along the inside then two wide on the turn, found traffic at the quarter pole, tipped three wide into the clear and failed to
menace. ANTHONY'S BEST stalked three wide into the turn, four deep at the five-sixteenths pole, remained wide into the lane and weakened. DISTANT
STEPPES hard to load, stalked off the inside, lost ground while ridden along through the turn two to three wide and faded. PRINCE GRAYGRAY away
quickly to take the front, dueled with WARRIOR ROAD leaving the backstretch, dropped back around the bend and gave way.

Footnotes
TOM HORN raced up close outside the top pair, bid three wide into the stretch and drew away. DEVIL MOON dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead
around the bend, could not fend off TOM HORN in upper stretch and stayed on to secure the place. LANSDOWNE (GB) tracked three deep to the stretch
and outfinished SHORONA'S WILD BOY for the show honors. SHARONA'S WILD BOY tracked two wide into the turn then between rivals, kept on through
the stretch run and got edged for third. TIGERHON (FR) dueled for the lead from outside, fought to the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane.
POWERTRAIN broke a step slow, hustled early then had to pause halting momentum, chased at the back on the inside into the turn, saved ground to the
stretch, lacked room in the lane and could not rally. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) trailed early then went between rivals into the turn, traveled two then three
wide around the bend, tipped out at the top of the stretch and could not rally. RAKA RAKA CRUZ stalked the top trio from inside, cut the corner into the lane
and flattened out. PAPA TIGER chased in range then lost his path near the half-mile pole, traveled three deep at the back into the turn, spun three wide into
the lane and came up empty.

Footnotes
BIG POND got bothered by SMILING LADY coming in early, closest in pursuit three wide into the turn, took over approaching the five-sixteenths pole,
dueled inside CHISMOSA still three wide leaving the turn, dug in the late and inched clear. CHISMOSA came in at the start, trailed early then moved into
range four deep, bid three deep or four wide on the turn, fought outside BIG POND into the lane, dueled down the stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth.
CEILING CRUSHER bumped with ABSOLUTELY ZERO leaving the gate then bumped again with that rival past the chute, chased between then two wide
on the turn, moved in entering the stretch and finished willingly for a clear third. CHOLLY stumbled slightly at the start, tracked three wide into the turn, came
four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. SMILING LADY broke out then came in at the start while still taking command, showed the way two wide into the
turn, relinquished the lead nearing the five-sixteenths pole and retreated. ABSOLUTELY ZERO bumped with CEILING CRUSHER at the start, climbed early
then bumped with that rival again early, chased on the inside into the turn, dropped back around the bend and tipped off the rail and had little left for the
stretch run.

Footnotes
RUFF RIDE broke a step slow on the outside, raced two wide outside a rival near the back, drew closer while easing out to the five path around the far turn,
surged to the front midstretch and kicked clear. CANDY ON TOP stalked in the two path outside a rival, ridden along three wide entering the lane, launched
a bid in midstretch, could not match strides with RUFF RIDE in deep stretch and stayed on to hold second. IDESSIA was off slow in the beginning, tracked
between rivals in the two path off the pace, raced two then three wide around the far turn, moved out and finished well to miss second. ASHLEYS
SANDCASTLE got bumped from inside at the start, tucked inside racing towards the rear, traveled a bit off the rail into the lane, summoned a mild rally and
earned a minor award. ANNIE'S HOPE was closest in pursuit from outside in the early going, bid two wide around the far turn, dueled into the lane, took
over in upper stretch, drifted out midstretch and yielded with a sixteenth remaining. TAPIT ROCKS was off slow in the beginning, traveled two wide outside
a rival at the back, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and improved position. STRANGE ADDICTION tracked three deep in mid-pack early on, remained
outside rivals and came four wide into the drive but flattened in the stretch run. BOLD CHOICE broke alertly then took a stalking position from inside, tipped
out in upper stretch, lost his path when the leader drifted out midstretch and flattened after. WARRIOR LADY settled off the pace along the rail, coaxed from
the fence on the far turn, cut the corner into the lane and could not rally. JERSEY SUNSET broke out and bumped rival, went up to take control and moved
inside, met the challenge from ANNIE'S HOPE on the far turn, dueled into the lane, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. BETSY IS THE CODE
unhurried from inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to make an impact.
