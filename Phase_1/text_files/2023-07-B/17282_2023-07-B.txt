FAST BREAKIN CASH led early, rated outside before the half, took over at the quarter pole and edged away in a steady drive. DALTON vied briefly, moved
clear before half a mile, was collared again on the turn, lost the lead in the stretch but continued gamely. JACOHARE chased within striking range two wide
then flattened out in the stretch. COMMISSIONER G clipped heels and bobbled early then passed fading rivals. MISCHIEVOUS JUAN dropped back early
inside and was never in contention. FRENCH TOAST had his heels clipped early, came over into the first turn then was outrun. RON DON SCORESE
dropped back early and weakened steadily. AMIGOS GUITAR was taken up sharply entering first turn and stopped abruptly. The stewards posted an inquiry
into the incident into the first turn.

midway on the turn, led in the stretch and held on gamely while unable to resist the winner. JODY'S RUBY broke alertly and set the pace inside, was
collared midway on the turn and weakened. ONE EYED JACKIE raced close up three wide then faltered in the stretch. BETSY IS THE GAL flashed speed
along the rail and began fading on the turn. BAY BAY BIRDIE saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. NORMANDY LIFE lunged and stumbled at the
break, moved inside on the turn and was no factor. SARATOGA SWEETS trailed early and was never in contention. SHE'SABULLETSTEPH dropped back
in the two path and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
PEYTON ELIZABETH outrun early, was steered wide on the turn, surged in the final furlong and was up in time. GOLDEN TABBY set a pressured pace,
moved briefly clear in midstretch, continued gamely but nailed nearing the wire. OUT DANCING urged close up inside, faded briefly in the stretch then came
again for the show. MIA TOSCA prompted the pace outside to the final furlong and faltered. IN MY OPINION lagged far behind then finished full of run
outside too late. CARTOUCHE dueled outside for half a mile and proved empty in the stretch. MEMENTO MI trailed far behind then passed rivals without
menacing. KISSES FOR EMILY lacked speed and was never in contention. SINGLE LADY chased in midpack, bid briefly closer on the turn then faded.
AEGEAN SEA was bumped about just after the start, chased wide then stopped abruptly.

TRADERS LUCK quickly took control, led in hand and remained clear throughout driving. OSPREY settled off the pace, commenced his rally on the turn
and was up for the place late. NICK THE CARDSHARK pursued the winner throughout and finished willingly. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE saved ground behind
the loose leader and faded in the stretch. MANOLETE angled inside after the opening quarter and lacked a rally. LITTLE HARBOUR broke in a complete
tangle losing any chance at the start. RUNNINGFORHOME trailed early and passed rivals without menacing. SOPHOS chased in midpack early and was
never a factor. ONE SLICK START dropped back wide and was finished after half a mile. RACK GIN moved well back outside and weakened steadily.
