KAY'S KITCHEN settled off the contested early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide entering the final
turn, and ran down a stubborn JUST MISTY while closing five wide in the drive to prove best. JUST MISTY dueled for the lead from the outside of AUNTIE J
entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backside, took command while racing two wide into the final turn,
maintained her advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off KAY'S KITCHEN late in a solid effort. VALERIE VALESKI away alertly and tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to garner a share.
TEXAS HUMOR trailed the field into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a serious
late bid while finishing five wide in the drive. AUNTIE J away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch, struggled to match strides with JUST MISTY entering the final turn, and faded over the final furlong.

ANAAMY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backside
and into the final turn, opened a clear advantage leaving the turn and was never seriously threatened late. RACINO away alertly and stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, launched a three wide bid entering the final turn, and finished determinedly four wide in the drive to get up for
the place in the closing strides. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY tracked the contested pace in the run down the backstretch while racing two out from the rail,
dropped in to rally from just off the rail through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to just miss the place. WALKINTHEWALK unhurried early
while trailing the field into the first turn while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, but needed more late while
finishing four out from the rail in the drive. BAKZONE away well and pressed the pace from the outside of ANAAMY entering the first turn, continued to force
the issue two wide into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

HARTLEY MANOR away alertly and quickly sprinted to a clear advantage in the run to the turn, held a clear lead through the turn, and increased her margin
in the drive while confidently handled. DREAMING D'ORO chased the leader into the turn while racing just out from the rail, and closed willingly two wide in
the drive to hold the place. BECKETT'S BEST away well and chased the leader into the turn while racing one out from the rail, and closed three wide in the
drive to just miss the place. STORMY RUNNER lacked the early speed to contend in the early stages while racing one out from the rail entering the turn,
and closed with a rush four wide in the drive to just miss the place. RICK'S DANCER was devoid of early speed in the run to the turn, saved ground through
the turn, and finished with late interest from along the rail in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. I C KOFFEE broke sharply, but was devoid
of early speed and trailed the field into the turn, and failed to make a late impact.

SHAMRA broke sharply and was allowed to settle towards the back of the pack while saving ground at the rail entering the stretch the first time, rushed up
four wide entering the backside and took a narrow lead into the final turn while racing one out from the rail, held a clear lead into the stretch, and was never
seriously threatened late. REA MEA away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along
the rail through the second turn and into the backstretch, was overtaken entering the final turn, but battled gamely through the final furlong to hold the place.
PRETTY ARIA tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained a tracking trip in the run down the backside
and into the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive to just miss the place. WANDALITA away alertly and was allowed to settle towards the back of the
pack while racing one out from the rail entering the stretch the first time, stayed within striking position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the
inside through the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while unable to mount a serious late bid. BELCARRA PARK hopped at the start, but rushed
up to force the issue two wide entering the first turn, continued to force the issue from the outside of REA MEA through the second turn and into the
backstretch, jumped tractor tracks mid way down the backside and briefly lost her action, and was through thereafter.

along the inside entering the final turn, slipped through along the rail entering the lane, and was up in the closing strides to prevail. NINE OCLOCK CEASER
away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn,
maintained the lead through the final turn, and just failed to last. TAM TRICKY away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out
from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn,and finished three wide in the drive while unable to match strides with the top pair late. VISENYA
settled at the back of the pack while saving ground into the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest
five wide in the drive. CARLA'S HONOR stalked the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside, rallied along the inside entering
the final turn, tipped four wide entering the lane, and finished three out from the rail in the drive. PENALTY TO RANGERS broke sharply and chased the
leader three wide into the first turn, and held a tracking trip two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch. began to weaken approaching the final turn,

AN ARMY OF LIGHT away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of MY MAN STAN
in the run down the backside and into the final turn, turned back a threat by CROWN COUNCIL leaving the turn, and held sway while drifting three wide in
the drive. CROWN COUNCIL tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside
entering the final turn, shifted off the rail leaving the turn to tackle the pacesetter, was no match for that rival late, but finished willingly three out from the rail
in the drive to prove clearly second best. CAIRO CRUSADER away alertly, but was allowed to settle at the back of the pack entering the first turn, began to
advance soon after entering the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and closed six wide in the drive to get up for a share. MY MAN STAN
broke sharply and pressed the leader in the run down the backside while racing two wide, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but was
outfinished over the final furlong. KIKI'S SUNDANCER was squeezed soon after the start and settled well off the early pace while racing two wide entering
the backside, was always well back and showed little.

SILK STILETTOS raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace from along the rail through the stretch the first time, held a
clear advantage in the run down the backside and through the final turn, and was all out to fend off a late surge by IRISH LUNA to prevail. IRISH LUNA
away alertly and tracked the leader into the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside, rallied
from along the rail through the final turn, eased off the rail in deep stretch and closed with a rush to just miss. OSTRACIZE stalked the early pace while
racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, maintained her position in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to garner a share. ARTISTIC JEWLER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, began to advance
four wide shortly after entering the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished evenly three wide in the drive. ZETAMARIE broke
sharply, but was allowed to settle well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied along the inside entering the
final turn, but needed more when called upon. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the
first time, held a striking position in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when
called upon. HARLAN'S ANGEL away well and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained her position
in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.
