Footnotes
POOF HE'S GONE was carried out leaving the turn, dueled throughout and proved best in a long drive. ZESTY JAZZMAN raced close to the pace, swung
wide entering the stretch, found his best stride late, was gaining ground and got up for place. D C ALLIED FORCES swung wide leaving the turn, dueled
throughout and was outfinished in a good effort. RAFAEL'S SURPRISE dropped inside while racing close to the pace, finished well and gained late.
MICKEYS GOLD raced mid pack along the inside, shifted out and bid four wide, closed well and didn't have enough late. RELEASE THE GENIE raced
outside in an even effort and failed to threaten. INFINITE CROWN was not a factor. REEL EM IN stumbled at the start and had the rider lose his irons. The
stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start. No change was made.

Footnotes
PHANTOMOFTHEOPERE raced close to the pace while wide, closed willingly and wore down his rivals to get up late. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT pressed the
pace, challenged between horses on the turn, assumed command with a short lead, led to the final strides and was outfinished. THE FINAL FOOTNOTE
pressed the pace, challenged three across on the turn, dueled to deep stretch and yielded grudgingly. IM STILL THIRSTY moved up inside to set a
pressured pace to the turn, continued to vie when headed and faltered near the sixteenth pole. RIO HATO was never far back in a wide trip, lacked a stretch
response and failed to menace. WESTLAND was rated back at the start and improved position in an even effort. TEQUILA reared at the start to be off
slowly, was taken outside and raced evenly. EL GRAPPLER was not a factor. INDIAN NIGHTS pressed the pace four across, fell back, dropped inside and
stopped. SNOW IN THE NORTH showed little. WHO'S ON THE RUN pulled up and was vanned off. The stewards' posted an inquiry concerning the start.
No change was made.

Footnotes
LUCKY AND DARING broke out and bumped at the start, was taken outside past the gap, raced close to the pace, rallied four wide on the turn, closed
willingly, drew off and won going away. CLEVER GEM set the pace, faltered near the sixteenth pole and finished second best. HEY MACARENA raced mid
pack along the inside, angled out into the turn, swung wide into the stretch and closed to get up late for show. ROCKETT'S RED CITY pressed the pace to
the turn, fell back, finished evenly and was caught for third. PARK IN THE DARK broke awkwardly to be away slowly, raced in the back and improved
position in an even effort. BEVERLY WHO raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. BRANNY raced close to the pace, bid along the
inside on the turn, lacked a stretch response and dropped back. HUNKALICIOUS was outrun in an even effort. DROP TOP bumped at the start, was in
traffic while racing in the back, failed to respond and was not urged late.

Footnotes
HOLOTTALUTE stalked the pace while racing outside, closed steadily and drew clear late. FIRST AGAIN dropped inside to save ground, pressed the pace,
bid along the rail on the turn, dueled for the lead and earned place in a game effort. SHEZA HAILSTORM was fractious in the gate, ducked out and bumped
at the start, set the pace to deep stretch and was outclosed. MAMA WAS A ROCKET bumped hard at the start, pressed the pace, bid and hung. SHAME
ON CHARLOTTE was away alertly, swung wide leaving the turn and lacked a bid. BETTER BELIEVE lunged inward and was checked at the start, raced
under restraint along the inside to the turn, angled out , lacked a bid and was not urged in the stretch.

ANCIENT LAND was sent to the front, led throughout and held well while kept to task. JET N G went six wide on the first turn, stalked the pace in a good
position, closed steadily and gained late to narrow the gap. SPINNING BLACK raced mid pack in an even effort and was along for show. MASTERCLASS
was never far back, raced outside, lacked a bid and was outrun. THE LAST FEAT raced inside in an even effort and was not a threat. JET SET WARRIOR
trailed the field.
