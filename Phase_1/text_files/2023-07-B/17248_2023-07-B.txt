Footnotes
GONNABEE stalked the pace while racing outside, rallied into the turn, assumed command and drew off under mild urging. I GET STORMED stalked the
pace, bid willingly, couldn't gain on the winner and held for place. MISS JAX lagged early, saved ground, got through along the rail on the turn, found her
best stride late and was gaining ground. ARTFUL ROSE pressed the pace along the inside, angled out at the top of the stretch, bid and hung and was
caught for show. SHEZACONSTANTSONG pressed the pace while racing between horses, fell back on the turn, swung wide and closed steadily.
SHADOW JUMPER was sent to the front to set the pace to the turn, weakened and faded through the stretch. TRICKING TRIXIE bumped at the start, was
slow early, swung wide on the turn and improved position. MISS ABILITY raced mid pack along the inside and failed to respond. TERAS SILENCE had brief
speed only. DIXIE JEN broke slowly and failed to contend. SUERTUDA pressed the pace between horses to the turn and stopped. STORMING PEACE was
pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
SECRETARY AT WAR pressed the pace to the second turn, assumed command and drew off. DADDY WHAT IF was taken back after the start, dropped
inside, shifted back out on the backstretch, steadily advanced to the second turn, bid, hung and was all out for place. KIRBY DERBY raced close to the pace
along the inside, fell back, angled out, bid between horses entering the turn, was steadied in tight quarters, went five wide entering the stretch and finished
well. EAST RAND stalked the pace, bid four wide entering the stretch and came up empty. CEBOLLA was slow early, raced inside, got through along the
rail on the turn and lacked a rally. SAMURAI JACK raced mid pack in an even effort and was not a threat. B A CHAMPION got away well, set the pace to
the second turn, tired and gave way. ELLIOT was void of early speed, swung wide at the top of the stretch and passed tiring rivals. ME AND JACK put in an
even effort in an outside trip and was outrun. MT. TAYLOR was through early. BRAZILIAN SUMMER was eased and walked off.

Footnotes
PLAYTHEMARKER settled off the pace in a good position, rallied three across on the turn, assumed command and drew off in the drive. SIMPLY
ELEMENTARY pressed the pace while racing between horses, was taken back, got boxed in entering the turn, angled out, bid six wide and didn't have
enough late. SHAME ON ZCUINTLE was steadied at the start, raced in the back, went five wide entering the stretch and closed to earn show. EL OCHO
raced mid pack along the inside, angled out for the drive and lacked a bid. JR'S CONFIDENCE was taken outside early, swung wide in the upper stretch
and drifted out. W F JAZZ CAT was away alertly, pressed the pace, challenged between horses on the turn and gave way. TEE ROY set a pressured pace
to the turn and gave way. CHISPISKI'S EMPIRE broke slowly and veered out at the start, raced wide and was not urged.
