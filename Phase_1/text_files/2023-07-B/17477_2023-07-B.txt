MS CLARA responded to threats in the stretch and held firm. DECIDER CARTEL QUEEN jostled away, rallied outside under right-handed encouragement,
and won the nod for place honors. APPRECIATE bumped leaving, closed gamely late, and was out nodded for second. TULSA TIMBER broke awkwardly,
and flew late. TIMBERS MOON lacked kick needed. FIRECRUNCH lacked a bid. TIMBER BUNNY crowded leaving, and was unable to recover the ground
lost from the start.

Footnotes
LIFES ADVENTURE set a pressured pace from the two path, was given his cue into the lane, and opened up under a strong hand ride, winning handily.
DADDY'S PEPPER stalked inside under a snug hold, rallied into the stretch, edged away, and held safely for place. AL REICHERT prompted the pace from
the four path, rallied between foes at the head of the stretch and inched clear to secure show. SIX SHOTS OF T tracked outside from the five path, battled
four wide into the stretch, and weakened. TAPFERSURE unhurried early, sat in striking distance, and tired.

BUNNY NOREEN contested the early pace inside of GHOSTLY RUNNER, drew clear in the far turn, opened up willingly through the stretch, and was
geared down to score easily. TENDER LOVE chased wide through the backstretch, closed gradually, and won the nod for place. WICKED WIZZY rated well
off the pace while five wide, cut the corner into the far turn, chased the leader through the stretch but was no match, and was caught in the final strides.
SMOKIN JOY carried wide early, and passed tiring rivals. HERE'S LEXIE chased the early pacesetters, and came up empty in the drive. GHOSTLY
RUNNER vied three wide for the early lead, sat just off the leader, and faded.

Footnotes
ADDYDIDIT showed good early speed to fan four wide in the opening turn, sat just off of the pacesetter, lodged a bid nearing the eighth pole, and dug in to
win the bob. GO MAMA was unhurried early then assumed the lead entering the backstretch, saved ground while showing the way, responded to
ADDYDIDIT in the drive, and was narrowly denied. SKY DESTINY took back leaving the opening turn, hustled three wide in the final turn, and closed
gradually. WHISKARITA raced five to six wide through the first turn, chased outside in the far turn, and improved late. IT'S ALEXUS was outsprinted in the
opening turn, saved ground inside, and went evenly through the stretch. EXACTLY stalked four wide, and had nothing left in the late stages.

Footnotes
VALENTINO ROSSA rated well off the pace while wide through the backstretch, moved up closer into striking distance, urged along into the lane, and won
driving. PUNCH PERFECT trailed the field, angled inside to the rail at the head of the stretch, and finished well getting by for place. LANA'S PRETTY GIRL
set a pressured pace from between foes, dueled inside of TAPULOUS in the final turn, was overtaken and gave way grudgingly after a long drive.
TAPULOUS pressed while four to five wide, fanned three wide leaving the backstretch, dueled outside of LANA'S PRETTY GIRL in the final turn, and
weakened late stretch. BAKED N WIRED fractious in gate, sat just off the pace from a rail position, and was through early.

Footnotes
MUDINATOR contested the early pace from the four path, was unable to move on with READYTOTAPNSING in the far turn, was kept on under steady
handling through the stretch, dug in to take over in the final yards. READYTOTAPNSING dueled for the lead under a strong hold leaving the chute, edged
away in the final turn, was under steady pressure through the stretch and was overcome in the later yards. FOUR O SIX CREED raced seven wide entering
the backstretch, circled the field into the lane, closed well outside and missed. NORTHERN JEWEL raced at the back of the pack, and rallied belatedly. BIG
BAD INTAGLIO sat just off the dueling pacesetters, brushed LAHUN at the head of the lane, angled inside then weakened. ARISTOCRACY sat along the
rail under a snug hold early, and failed to threaten in the drive. LAHUN raced the widest into the backstretch, moved up into striking range while four to five
wide, was knocked off stride when brushed near the three-sixteenth pole, and yielded. SHURAZ showed speed early while in traffic, and lost interest. LIL
ZAPPER flashed early speed and tired.

Footnotes
CARRIE'S SUCCESS saved ground from the three path, set sights on SMILIN EVIE into the lane then took over, and kicked clear. SMILIN EVIE vied from
the three path for the lead, moved clear in the final turn was overtaken into the stretch and finished second best. TALA saved ground early, uncorked a late
run for a good show finish. TAKE CHARGE GWEN jostled away, steadied in traffic entering the far turn, drove five wide under encouragement, and rallied
belatedly. DAZZLING CHIC rallied belatedly. CHATTY GAL stalked the early pacesetters from the five path, and lacked a closing response. LITTLE
ROSALYN lacked a clear path early, lodged a mild bid, and faded. KERIK lagged early and offered a late mild bid. WHEELSUPINTHIRTY bumped away
from the gate, and lacked a bid. WITHIN REASON contended the early pace outside of SMILIN EVIE, was unable to move on with foe, and yielded at the
top of the lane.
