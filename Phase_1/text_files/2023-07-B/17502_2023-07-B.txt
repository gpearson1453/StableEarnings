OLIVIAN sprinted to a clear lead and edged away in the stretch to prove best. MY MEADOW was off the pace on the inside but was no match for the
winner. DONNAS FINAL WORD was forwardly placed in the two path, dueled around the turn inside of TOTHEMOONANDBACK then moved to the inside
rail and was best of the rest. TOTHEMOONANDBACK was off the pace in the three path, dueled around the turn outside of DONNAS FINAL WORD and
tired in mid stretch. OUT OF THE SKY hopped at the start and trailed.

RACHIE RACH was reluctant to load, roused to the lead and pulled away on the turn, kept to task in the drive. JUST REMEMBER was forwardly placed
while racing three or four wide into the stretch, gave a late run to be second best. PALM COURT had no speed through the turn then made a late mid track
rally to be up for the show. RAGING LADY vied for the early lead then dueled outside of ALWAYS A TIZ in the middle of the pack and faded. ALWAYS A
TIZ prompted the early pace from the two path then dueled inside of RAGING LADY in the middle of the pack and faded. PEGGY B FAST saved ground to
no avail.

WEBCAM stalked the pace to mid turn then was coaxed at the five sixteenths and slipped through at the quarter pole and drew off. DOCS CARO CAT was
rushed up to share the command to mid stretch then fought gamely to hold on for the place. DEL ARGENT was forwardly placed from three wide and was
coaxed at the five sixteenths to engage the leaders at the quarter pole, fought gamely down the stretch to be up for the show. FRISCO KID trailed the field
through the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch and gave a late run to improve position but just missed the show. ROUGE SUNSET sprinted
away to share command to the quarter pole and gave way grudgingly. NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST tracked the leaders from four wide on the backstretch,
fell back around the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LOVELY LOLA pressed the pace from the two path to the three sixteenths and engaged the leader at the quarter pole, took command at the eighth pole and
drew off. MANDONA went to the front to set a pressured pace to the quarter pole and was headed, matched strides with LOVELY LOLA to the quarter pole
and weakened but was able to hold on for the place. HERE AND VOW tracked the leaders from three wide and proved best of others. HOT LIL MESS raced
in the middle of the pack on the backstretch then made a mild bid on the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. AMBER WAVES saved ground but
never made a serious bid. GEORGIANO was off the pace from four wide to the top of the stretch and tired. EYEJUST TOOKCHARGE was not a threat and
was always back. CAROLYN'S WAY remained back.
