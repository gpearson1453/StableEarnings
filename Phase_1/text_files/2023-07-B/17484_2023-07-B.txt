Footnotes
HAL'S DREAM forwardly placed outside, continued to stalk in the run up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge three wide with a quarter to run, dueled
length off stretch, proved narrowly best in a determined effort. BROKEN PROPOSAL prompted the leader for five furlongs off the inside, challenged
between rivals late in the final turn, long, spirited duel to the wire, stubbornly. HONORARY GUEST back off the early pace while four wide through the first
turn, continued outside and was four wide again through the second bend, rallied down the stretch to gain the show while closing the gap on the top two
late. US SECOND CUTE PIE settled off the pace and the inside, continued evenly in lacking a closing punch. MY LITTLE JEN raced in mid pack while three
wide, continued in the three path into the straight, improved a bit late with some moderate interest. MISS JANA broke back and failed to menace.
LIMITLESS MAZIE broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn while a bit keen, held a dwindling advantage far turn, gave way when
headed by the top two entering the straight. STRUMMER last to leave, trailed, fell further back stretch, jogged across..

Footnotes
SWIFT N TRAFFIC off the lead pack up the backstretch, moved closer in the two path through the turn, shifted out a bit and went after the leader past the
furlong marker, wore that foe down under firm handling. KIT KAT KIDD chased the early leader up the backstretch, advanced to duel in the two path through
the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, responded when the winner came alongside with just under a furlong remaining, gave ground grudgingly
to that one, remained comfortably cler of the rest. PALANTE lacked speed for a half, asked along late in the turn, angled out four wide into the stretch,
rallied for the show well out in the strip. MULETRAIN last to leave, void of speed, two path into the lane, picked off a couple tiring rivals while never a serious
threat. JACKIE MOON within striking distance early, floated out four wide out of the turn, had little left for the stretch run. PETEY in mid pack outside, 4-5w
turn, tired through the stretch. REGINALD AURELIUS clear early from along the inside, dueled the middle part while remaining inside, gave way through the
stretch.

Footnotes
FOLLOW THE SAINT in the second flight first turn inside, moved out, continued to follow the two leaders up the backstretch, advanced and challenged
three wide into the straight, vied past the furlong marker then drove comfortably clear late. DIXIE FARMER broke in, lacked early foot, continued to lag into
the far turn, came four wide and outside the winner exiting the final turn, stalled upper stretch, late push to gain the place, not a threat to the winner.
COPPER MOON vied between rivals first turn, dueled in the run up the backstretch and into the far turn, narrowly showed the way into upper stretch, could
not match the winner the final sixteenth, caught in the final strides for the place. SUPER ET fell back to trail after the start, continued to lack speed the
middle half, came widest for the drive and showed some belated interest down the middle of the course. R T'S GEM forward early inside the two leaders, in
the second flight the middle half while continuing to save ground, within striking distance a furlong out, came up empty to the wire. PICKIN ANA GRINNIN
pinched back and was forced to check up, moved up quickly to contest the issue by midway on the first turn, dueled the next half mile, faltered from between
horses nearing the furlong grounds. ADDI BUG brushed at the start, was finished early.

Footnotes
MALLY'S MONSOON broke alertly, set a pressured pace up the backstretch and into the turn, shook well clear when straightened for home, enough left to
hold that same early pursuer safe late. BAYOU BEAUTY pressed the winner off the inside, fell back off that one in upper stretch, roused and was coming
back on that rival late. PORTO DEL ACE void of speed inside, asked along while saving ground midway on the turn, slipped thru along the rail to improve
into the lane, closed the gap on the top two a bit late while holding sway for the show. GOLD PLUS forwardly placed in the run up the backstretch, came in
the two path for the drive, not enough for the show. NICELY UNIFIED off a step slow, raced back and well out in the strip, four wide exiting the turn, was not
dangerous through the stretch. ARTIE'S DEAL off a step slow, devoid of speed in trailing, moved out, five wide into the stretch, not a factor the wire. SANDY
AUSTIN in the second group early, began a steady fade before a half, well back at the wire.

Footnotes
BOURBON DAY closest to the early leader, moved closer in the two path before a half while between horses, bid second turn, kicked strongly clear the final
furlong under steady handling. BUTLER CABIN shuffled back at the break to be last away, raced back early, advanced two path through the second turn,
closest to the winner a furlong out, proved no match for that one while willingly clear for the second spot. MAZING MARK moved well out in the course
midway through the first turn, continued wide up the backstretch, made a mild advance four wide through the final turn, up late for the show, no threat to the
top two. LITTLE ROCKY broke back, void of speed, two path into the lane, staged a mild rally through some traffic to improve position. GLUCKSTADT
forwardly placed off the inside, closer three wide turning for home, remained within striking distance through upper stretch then flattened the final furlong.
ITS WILD AGAIN void of speed for six furlongs, roused four wide into the lane, improved position well out in the course with some belated interest.
TARAASHOQ fell back to trail after a half, five wide turning for home, picked off a few tiring rivals while never a serious threat. DOUBLE ON THE RED tired
from his early efforts after racing with the main body. CAJUN AMI was also finished after five furlongs. F J'S FLACO sprinted clear to set the pace, stopped
when headed.

Footnotes
SILVER CHALICE away in good order, vied between rivals up the backstretch and through the turn, shook clear when straightened for home, and drew
away under steady pressure. CALLEN FEELS GOOD also with the pace from the start, vied three wide and outside the winner, could not match that one in
the drive, clearly second best. RAZZ broke well, fell back to mid pack, along for the show late before holding off a rival for that position in the final strides, no
match for the top two. CLEVER PRINCE last to leave, lacked speed, came four wide for the drive, found best stride too late well out in the strip while gaining
for the show spot late. TRADER PRICE vied up front along the inside for four furlongs, gave way through the stretch. PERFECT STRIKE lacked speed,
remained back in failing to rally. MR. BUTCH WOMBLE in the second flight in the early going, began to fade before a half.

Footnotes
PERIPHERAL VISION vied early off the inside, fell back off the leader late in the turn, rebid past the furlong marker, wore that rival down under brisk
handling. NATURALBORNSENDER moved up to vie soon after the start, garnered a larger lead along the inside late in the turn, responded when
challenged in midstretch and gave ground grudgingly while clear for the place. LAKE BALI steadied at the start to be back early, steered out to be five wide
into the lane, chased the top two past the furlong marker, made little inroads on that pair late, well clear of the others. SUM CHARM one paced behind the
speed, inside turn, traffic late in the bend, continued evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. CUPIE CUTIE broke back, continued to lack
speed while saving ground, improved position up the inside without posing a serious threat. AMELIES DREAMER vied up front outside the top two, began to
retreat late in the turn. SCRAPPY within striking distance for a half four wide, tired through the stretch. A. P. STYLE broke in to bother an inner rival, shuffled
back with four furlongs to go along the inside, moved out and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BILOXI outrun for a half toward the inside after breaking near the back, swung out to be five wide late in the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip, bid,
gained the advantage then dug in late to hold off the runner up while outside that one at the wire. RICKY BOBBY last to leave, also lacked any early speed,
three wide and between rivals into the stretch, challenged inside the winner and between horses inside the furlong maker, outkicked to the wire.
MOTAWAAFEQ with the early pace, shook clear late in the turn, continued to show the way past the furlong grounds, could not contain the top two the final
sixteenth, remained clear of the others. UNION DATA with the pace for four furlongs along the inside, fell back off the leader late in the turn, chased that one
through upper stretch and weakened. ASHAAB broke back, lacked speed, improved from between horses in the two path into the lane, flattened out the
final furlong to finish up evenly. B W P SPIRIT evenly paced off the inside, raced four wide and between horses into the stretch, lacked a finishing kick.
MALIBU S S failed to menace while racing inside. DOUBLE EDGE SWORD within striking distance for a half, had little left for the stretch run. CHARLIE'S
CREED contested the early pace while three wide, gave way before a half.

Footnotes
LIL MISS SUNSHINE broke on top, quickly clear, rated in showing the way into the stretch, maintained daylight through the lane while kept to task with a
steady right handed crop. TDZ CORRIENDA STAR back off the pace while racing outside, four wide into the lane, rallied to be closest to the winner past the
furlong marker, slowly closing the gap on that one while holding sway for the place. FINISHWHATUSTARTED forwardly placed after breaking in good order,
in some traffic in the two path late in the turn, improved position to be in time for the show. SECRET MELODY hesitated at the break, void of speed, five
wide into the lane, improved mid track. OUR CLOVER GAL in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the lane, went one paced through the stretch.
BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR fell back to trail, five to six wide turning for home, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a serious threat.
MISSHEARTBREAKER within striking distance off the inside, tired in the drive. DORGENOIS off slow, remained back, was never a threat. APRIORITY
GIRL in mid pack for a half, backed up through the stretch. WHO DAT GINGER chased the winner for three furlongs and stopped.
