Footnotes
LOOK OUT LAMBO quickly moved clear, widened on the final turn and remained safe in a moderate drive. MISSISSIPPI saved ground throughout and
continued well while no threat. RELISHMENT chased between rivals, made a brief bid midway on the turn then flattened out. WHAT'S TO BLAME settled off
the pace in hand, was asked for run on the turn but had no response. SOMEBODY raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter for half a mile and faded.
LONG GRAY LINE trailed early, made a brief wide bid before half a mile and gave way.

Footnotes
LOOSE GOOSE rated just off the leaders along rail, rallied inside the pacesetters late to get up in time. COLES CONUNDRUM set a clear pace for half a
mile, vied from the far turn and continued gamely while nailed at the wire. ALONZO MOSELY engaged the pacesetter after half a mile and battled to the
finish. BATTER UP BUD lacked speed then finished full of run outside through the stretch. SAL N LOUIE settled close up inside then weakened on the final
turn. STELLA'S TOUR chased far back then narrowed the gap without menacing. BROTHER SHOWTYME moved closer outside into the final turn and
faltered. PREDOMINATE saved ground off the pace and lacked a response. MORE THAN A DANCE was fanned very wide on the first turn, remained wide
and faded. OMERTA CODE raced outside and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SOUTH AMERICA quickly moved clear then widened throughout dominating his rivals while kept to task. LONESOME BOY broke a step slowly, moved five
wide on the turn, angled in at the quarter pole and rallied. CIGALE ducked out at the start then offered a steady rally to gain the show. OMAHA EIGHT raced
in closest pursuit of the pacesetter than proved empty in the final furlong. BIG ERN MCCRACKEN hustled wide down the backstretch then passed rivals
while no threat. SAVAGE DRAGON flashed speed in the two path and faded in the stretch. RUNLIKECARL dropped back in the opening quarter and was
never a factor. MYHEARTWILLGOON raced close up briefly wide then steadily faded. MINNY SPEIGHTSTER saved ground and gave way readily.
KLAATUBARADA NIKTO lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

LEASE stumbled while breaking alertly, took over after the half then drew away under wraps. DOCTOR DOOM settled off the pace outside, bid on the final
turn and proved no match for the winner. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE set a clear pace in the opening half mile and weakened. SOVEREIGN CHANGE saved
ground close up briefly then stopped abruptly.

LUCKY AS A SEVEN raced close up three wide, took over before the half and drew away under moderate pressure. HANEY BOYS vied outside with a
narrow edge, was collared again on the turn and was no match for the winner. SCANDALISSIMO urged close up wide down the backstretch and continued
well. BODE O trailed far behind then showed late energy while wide. J WASS moved up four wide into the far turn then weakened. MR. TUTTLE saved
ground off the pace and faded. SMARTHUMOR forced the pace along the inside for half mile and gave way. ROCKIN FREEBEE broke slowest and was
never in contention.
