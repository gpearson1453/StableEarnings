LITTLE RED BUTTON was quick to begin from the outside to cross over to race near the rail early, confidently ridden through the far turn and drew off to be
clear under steady handling. BOSS CARA chased the early pace three deep, was three to four wide around the far turn and kicked on late to get up for the
place position while racing from the outside. CINQUE AMORE was coaxed along two deep between early on, hard ridden through the far turn and
weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. STARSHIP BLANCA chased the early leaders from the inside and lacked a bid.

CRITICAL THINKING tracked the early leader two deep, moved up three wide near the three sixteenths pole to collar the leader, dug in late and prevailed
under all out pressure. MR JACK showed good early foot two wide early, challenged from the outside through the upper stretch from Critical Thinking, dug in
late and just missed in a game effort. SKIMBLE SHANKS stalked the pace three deep, made a four wide bid to challenge near the quarter pole and finished
willingly to the wire. HEXAGON dropped back off the early pace, raced near the inside and lacked a bid. SYNONYM broke awkwardly, lost a considerable
amount of ground at the start, raced near the back after the bad start, was five deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
BILLIEANNE stalked the pace from the outside of foes, moved up four to five wide around the far turn, dug in late and edged clear under strong handling
while racing three deep. LANFRANKOPHILE coaxed three deep early on, took aim four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled out and finished gamely
to the wire. QUEEN ROSEMARY pressed the early leader two deep early on and kept on willingly to the wire. KATY THE CAT settled to race mid pack early
on, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and raced even late with no closing run. TERPEYE was off slowly, void of early speed, raced three wide in
the lane and showed late interest to improve position. SNAPPY RIDE dropped back early, raced from the outside in the lane and lacked a bid. PSYCHE
vied for the early lead from the inside and was empty in the drive.
