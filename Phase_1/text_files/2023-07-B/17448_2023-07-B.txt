Footnotes
JIMMYTHETOOTH forwardly placed just off the early leader along the inside, advanced to take over command half a mile from home and showed the way
through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. HARD PAR
coaxed from the gate, crossed to chase along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, straightened
away to the rail before tipping out a furlong out, then ran on willingly to secure the place honors. FILM ACADEMY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
pace three wide down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the turn around the fading I AM DADA MOON coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors. PRICE IS TRUTH broke in at the start and was corrected,
chased just off the inside in aim of the front, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages.
INSTAMATIC hesitated at the start standing in the gate for a beat as the rest of the field left and then got away lunging awkward and conceded five to six
lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch and
offered up a mild bid. SAVAGE SPIRIT was hard to load prior to the start requiring a blindfold, shied in at the start in reaction to PRICE IS TRUTH breaking
inwards and bumped SENEGAL solidly into CHARLIE TOUGH and conceded three to four lengths himself to the front, chased three then two wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and stayed on one paced to the finish. BALI AMOUR chased briefly along the inside and
then just off the inside until tucked inside once more through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. I AM DADA MOON showed brief speed from the three path leading the way early on until headed near the half mile pole, briefly tucked to the
two path and then floated four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch and tired. SENEGAL got
bumped solidly at the start by SAVAGE SPIRIT and in turn bumped CHARLIE TOUGH, conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and
made no impact. CHARLIE TOUGH got bumped solidly at the start by SENEGAL due to pressure from SAVAGE SPIRIT and conceded two lengths to the
front, chased just off the inside, was in the midst of being tipped out inside the seven-sixteenths when floating three then four wide, got out through the turn
and was eased up and placed to a protective hold, then got pulled up in the vicinity of the eighth pole and was subsequently vanned off.

Footnotes
MISS SAN GABRIEL went to the front, showed the way while inside to the two path, responded well when asked outside the quarter-pole, held a clear
advantage under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong then came under a right-handed crop and held under strong urging. TAP IT UP was well placed
just off the pace on the inside, came under encouragement on the far turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive
in the stretch and just held the place. LADY JASMINE was hustled from the gate, stalked the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was given her cue
on the final turn, chased the top two while remaining on her inside lead to the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead at that point and just missed the
place while clear for the show. ANILEATE threw her head to the outside while away awkwardly then bumped with an opponent, lugged in some on the initial
straightaway, was taken up off heels while near two bumping foes into the first turn, went three wide going around that bend, was reserved on the outside
but with the benefit of cover, went three then four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. FROSTY INVASION
bumped hard with an opponent into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, was rated off the pace, moved in nearing the half-mile pole, saved
ground while roused on the far turn and also lacked the needed kick. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT was taken under tight restraint early, went three wide on the
first turn, was rated near the middle of the field, came under urging in the two path on the far turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and failed to
rally. SISTER NELL was taken under a tight hold early then reserved under stout restraint in the two path, came under urging near the quarter-pole and also
failed to rally. HARLAN'S BOND bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, was rated off the pace, traveled three wide while asked on
the far turn, was driven four wide int the stretch and lacked the needed response. POUT bumped hard with a foe into the first turn then checked sharply
along the rail early on that bend, dropped well behind while saving ground, came out into the stretch and was eased but walked off. THE THREE-QUARTER

IT TAKES HEART two to three wide in pursuit, advanced on the leader midway on the turn given a notch to work with, took over command nearing the
quarter pole and swung three to four wide into upper stretch, then went clear under a drive kept to task. ARELLA STAR coaxed from the gate, showed the
way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing just off the inside midway on the turn under threat to the outside, got collared nearing the quarter pole

MISE EN SCENE (GB) got bumped and brushed at the start when SAIL BY broke outwards and PLEASANT PASSAGE came inwards slightly, settled just
off the inside near the rear of the field, slipped briefly four then three wide nearing the five-sixteenths when BEAUTE CACHEE came off the fence to the two
path inside and in front, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, closed well outside and was just up in the final jumps to the finish. BEAUTE CACHEE
(FR) forward from the break, got taken under a hold when MISS CAROL ANN crossed directly in front into the first turn and skygazed a bit a rank under the
restraint before settling to track inside through the rest of the bend and down the backstretch, remained on hold until slipping out subtly to the two path near
the five-sixteenths, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining on the leader to
take command seventy yards from home, then got nailed in the last strides to the line. PLEASANT PASSAGE came in slightly at the start brushing with
MISE EN SCENE, saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch and was under
urging tipping out slightly to the two path when clear of the backing away VERONICA GREENE a furlong from home as the leader closed down the inside
seam some making it a tight lane, had to pause just off that rival's hind end a sixteenth out unable to tip out with a pair of foes there before gaining
clearance to the inside of MISS CAROL ANN, altered in roused and offered up a mild bid to secure the show honors in the shadow the wire. MISS CAROL
ANN (IRE) established the front shortly after the start and crossed to the inside into the first turn, showed the way under rating along the inside under
attendance from VERONICA GREENE to the outside but facing little pressure save from her presence, remained patiently handled until set down spinning
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat and succumbed to it seventy yards from home, then got out-finished in the final jumps
for the show honors while clear of the rest. SAIL BY broke out at the start bumping MISE EN SCENE and then was bumped back due to pressure from
PLEASANT PASSAGE and found herself in behind BEAUTE CACHEE, grew rank along the inside under restraint in behind rivals off heels, took to the two
path into the backstretch before tucking back inside five furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and kicked on belatedly by mostly tired rivals. VERONICA GREENE three wide through the first turn, attended the leader from the outside in the two path,
came under coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. BRAMBLE BAY two to three wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

CALDWELL LUVS GOLD broke near the back of the field, climbed into the kickback early, was urged along well off the pace, moved out late on the
backstretch, went three to four wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to win going away.
FOCUS POCUS broke in and bumped with a foe, chased the pace on the outside, engaged the leader in the three path on the turn, was roused nearing the
quarter-pole, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive until near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. LADY ARWEN
broke a step slow then was taken up while having her path taken, moved up under urging, gained four wide on the turn, chased the runner-up under a drive
into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. KANT CALL IT broke out and bumped with a foe, moved up to take the lead, showed the
way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. GRAB THE
GLORY was away fast, showed speed then chased the pace, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. DREAMERY was hustled from the start then
ridden along towards the rear, started the turn in the two path, was taken up inside the five-sixteenths then moved to the three path, was carried four wide
outside the quarter-pole then spun five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. POSEIDON'S MIST was hustled from the gate then urged along off the
pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and was no factor.
REGENERATOR was fractious leaving the paddock path and onto the main-track, departed the gate under urging, went around the turn in the two path and
failed to respond. ARCHIVIST was hustled from the start, dropped back under urging on the far outside, fell well behind in the six path on the turn and
faltered then was eased but walked off.

Footnotes
EYES ON TARGET got bumped at the start in a chain of small bumps begun by CONTINENTAL DIVIDE, tracked the front from just off the inside in mid
pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, was under a light drive in behind the top pair just off the inside, had
the rider look to the outside, tipped out into a space three to four paths off the rail forcing TARTINI to check between to pinching foes and TOMMY BEE who
was attempting to angle in to the seam from the outside to pause and steady in behind and to the outside of TARTINI, then rallied into the open lane and
was just up in the final jumps to prevail. LANDBISCUIT three then two wide through the first turn, attended the leader to the outside in the two path, came
under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive knocking heads with MICROSECOND through to
inside the eighth pole when taking narrow command nearing the sixteenth marker, then got nailed in the very last strides to the finish. KLICKITAT settled
just off the inside just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied outside rivals and missed at the
finish. MICROSECOND four wide into the first turn, tucked to the inside when clearing rivals to show the way in hand along the rail under attendance to the
outside and under some pressure from that rival, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch under challenge, dug in
head to head through to inside the eighth pole, got collared nearing the sixteenth pole and weakened in the very late stages. TOMMY BEE coaxed from the
start, tracked the pace along the inside through to the far turn when tipped out two then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive behind foes and spied an opening nearing the sixteenth marker to the inside and briefly came in to head for it
when forced to steady as EYES ON TARGET beat him to the lane and tipped out, brushed with TARTINI who was forced to check at that station with
pressure from both sides, then kept on evenly to the finish having lost about a length of position to the incident. SPEEDY HANS three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish but was outkicked. CUPID'S CLAWS got bumped at
the start by CONTINENTAL DIVIDE and in turn bumped EYES ON TARGET into GOLDINI, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. TARTINI tracked the pace along the inside from mid
pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and had TOMMY BEE attempt to tip inwards in
front from behind KLICKITAT to an open seam as EYES ON TARGET tipped out from in behind the top pair at the same moment, got forced to check from
that losing momentum and position as a result near the sixteenth pole as TOMMY BEE bumped him and steadied to his outside, and couldn't recover to the
finish. HUGE BIGLY coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch
and made no headway. GOLDINI bumped at the start in a chain of bumps, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
three wide for home and weakened. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE broke out at the start commencing a chain of small bumps out through GOLDINI, chased two
to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and trailed throughout. There was a Jockey's Objection by the rider of
TARTINI alleging interference against EYES ON TARGET in the stretch run. After review, it was deemed that EYES ON TARGET had indeed interfered with
TARTINI and was therefore disqualified and placed eighth before the result was declared official.

NEXT stalked the pace on the outside in the two path while traveling comfortably, took over with three furlongs to run, moved clear at the five-sixteenths,
extended the advantage while shaken up into upper stretch, was given one light tap of a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, drew away while kept to
the task into the final seventy yards and proved much the best under a mild hand-ride to the finish. TIME FOR TROUBLE bumped with a rival at the start,
was reserved at the rear while two to three wide, gained under urging on the final turn, shifted four wide before the five-sixteenths, was driven five wide into
the stretch, drifted in while outside of a foe inside the furlong marker and safely secured the place. DASH ATTACK broke out and bumped with a foe, settled
while inside to the two path, chased on the final turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, drifted in inside the furlong marker and weakened but was clear
for the show. THE SKIPPER TOO dropped back early, was reserved in the two path for the first two turns, settled kindly down the backstretch, was roused
with a half-mile to run, went four then five wide on the final turn, dropped to the three path outside the quarter-pole and failed to respond. SEA FOAM was
coaxed to the front, showed the way on the inside with a clear advantage, lost the lead midway through the final turn and faded. LONE ROCK tugged on the
bit under restraint into the first turn, went two to three wide on that bend, settled on the outside in three path, was urged along on the backstretch, dropped
back three wide on the final turn and faltered then was eased but walked off. TREASURE TROVE was last to commence then dropped back, saved ground
at the rear and also faltered then was eased but walked off. ALL TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMING ISSUE AND PROVIDED BY THE NYRA

Footnotes
PIONEERING SPIRIT saved ground in pursuit from mid pack early on, tipped two to three wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing just off the inside
at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive to prevail. GOOD
SKATE settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a
mild kick to secure the place honors. DRIPPING GOLD coaxed from the gate, raced forwardly placed just off the inside in closest aim of the leader until
overtaken by a spurting away HIGH TIDE, tracked that rival in tandem with SPACE LAUNCH into the second turn and the backstretch, inherited the front as
that rival backed out with five furlongs to go, showed the way along the inside, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was caught
near the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the show honors. SERIFOS saved ground in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. SPACE LAUNCH coaxed from the gate, led early on along the inside until
displaced by a spurting rival, tracked along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
ONENIGHTSTANDARDS coaxed from the start, tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper
stretch and weakened, then got vanned off after the finish. MERLIN two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing and bid at the three-eighths, spun just
off the inside into upper stretch and tired. ROYNE three wide early on, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide
into upper stretch and made no impact. NONEEDTOWORRY chased three to four wide until tucked inside into the final turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. HIGH TIDE five wide through the first turn, pulled his way advancing outside rivals four
wide past the stands to take command near the sixteenth pole the initial time around, went three wide through the second turn spurting away, yielded the
front with five-furlongs to go while seven to eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, was eased along to a gallop and went five to six wide through
the far and final turn and then continued to be eased home to the finish well behind but walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
SOSUA SUMMER settled near the middle of the field, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied on the
outside, drifted in some while closing fast inside the furlong marker, gained the advantage inside the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under strong handling.
SOUPER QUEST went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path on the turn, was asked into the stretch then extended
the advantage, responded well under the crop into the final furlong, swapped back to his inside lead while still in front coming to the sixteenth-pole and was
caught but earned the place. RICHY chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, pursued the top two under a drive in the stretch and
finished with good courage for the show. MACKILLOP dropped back while ridden along, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the
stretch, moved out near the three-sixteenths and improved position. FAMOUS GENT stumbled at the start, was urged along near the back, moved in late on
the backstretch, shifted from the rail to the three path early on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TIVY was hustled from the
start then urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. THREE ZERO bumped twice with an opponent at
the start, settled under some urging, went three then two wide on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, steadied between foes at the sixteenth-pole and
failed to threaten. AWESOME NATIVE bumped twice with an opponent at the start, was urged along at the rear, saved ground on the turn and was no
factor. CHARGING chased the pace on the outside then three wide on the turn and capitulated.
