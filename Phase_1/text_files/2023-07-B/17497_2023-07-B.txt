drive under mild urging. ATTACKING BOY raced close to the pace in an outside trip, closed steadily and got up for place while no threat to the winner. DON
HOLLYWOOD pressed the pace along the inside, was taken back and angled out on the backstretch, rallied between horses into the turn to challenge, fell
back into the stretch and was outfinished for second. BOOM BOOM DADDY broke out, saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack, bid inside at the
top of the lane, loomed a threat and hung late. HUNKALICIOUS veered out at the start, bore out on the first turn, was checked entering the backstretch and
lacked a stretch response. LEA COSTA ME was carried out on the firs turn, raced in the back and failed to respond. HUNKY DUNN broke in and bumped at
the start, pressed the pace towards the outside, rallied into the second turn, stopped and was not urged late.

Footnotes
JASMINE WHO angled out past the gap, challenged three across, dueled through the stretch and inched away late. BAND OF GLORY vied to the final
strides, yielded and was clearly best of the rest. EVIL TEMPTATION raced mid pack in a wide trip and offered a mild bid to be along for show. LAS TRES
MARIPOSAS pressed the pace along the inside, angled out on the turn, swung wide and dropped back. JEDI JENNIE showed little in an even effort.
FLOWER POWER vied two across, stopped into the turn and was not urged late. RELEASE THE GENIE was checked leaving the gate, taken wide, was
under restraint, eased and walked off.

Footnotes
NACHO GRANDE veered out at the start, dropped inside, bid along the rail on the turn, assumed command and drew clear. BLUE JEAN BOURBON
pressed the pace while racing three wide between horses, dropped back on the turn, continued willingly and held safely for place. LEGALLY REDDY
pressed the pace between horses to the turn, fell back, angled in and closed to earn show. SECOND BATTALION set a pressured pace to the turn, fell
back, leveled off and lost position. AWESOME QUEST was crowded and pushed out at the start, pressed the pace four across to the turn, swung wide and
gave way. SEA OF INDY lagged early in an inside trip, was not urged late and outrun. BIG D W was crowded and pushed out at the start and showed little
in a wide trip. SMARTY'S BERTRANDO was checked at the start to be off slowly, rushed up, stopped on the turn, was eased and walked off.
