Footnotes
WINE COLLECTOR was away alertly to set the early pressured pace on the inside, drew clear leaving the turn and then held sway late to prove best under
a drive. COPPER MISSILE was reserved early, four to three wide on the backstretch, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and
closed well to get the nod for the place award. GOLDEN ERA was reserved early, two wide by the half, tried to go between rivals but waited, shifted out by
the three eights marker and advanced five wide by the quarter pole, came wide into the lane and rallied well, outfinished for place, bested rest. ECHO LANE
pulled early on the inside and had to steady off heels on the first turn, then settled on the backstretch, made a inside bid leaving the turn but flattened out
the final furlong. RUM TUM TUGGER pressed the pace two wide and weakened. PIRATE RADIO was four wide into the first turn, then went up to vie for the
lead on the outside on the backstretch, then tired leaving the quarter pole. DESTINO stalked the early pace three wide, between rivals by the half mile
marker and then stopped on the turn.

Footnotes
Z FIRST unhurried early, swung five wide at the head of the stretch and was up in time in a determined drive. AFTER EIGHT stalked the pace through the
turn, rallied in upper stretch to take command and was denied at the wire. DETERMINED CHARM tracked the leaders in the turn from striking distance, split
horses closing well down the lane and came up just short. CAROLINE KRYSTYNA sped to the lead shortly from the gate, cleared briefly at the quarter pole,
responded gamely when challenged but could not last. MOANAS POWER pressed the pace to the top of the lane and weakened in the drive. JOYA DEL
SUR was never a factor.

Footnotes
CHAMBEAU broke alertly, settled in hand to prompt the pace to the top of the lane, took command in upper stretch and drew off to the wire. CAROLINA
SUN tracked the pace to the quarter pole, rallied between horses in upper stretch and finished willingly to gain the place. AISHA R N settled off the pace in
hand down the backside, rallied turning for home from between horses four wide and closed belatedly. CHICKAHOMINY reserved off the pace in mid-pack,
rallied down the lane through traffic to be gaining in deep stretch. MYSTIC SEAPORT went evenly and failed to gain down the lane. MY BOSS LADY slow
early to be at the back and showed late interest. AMERICAN HEIGHTS well placed in the early going to track the leaders and weakened in mid-stretch.
SPEAK YOUR MIND sped to the lead from the gate, opened a clear advantage and faltered turning for home.

Footnotes
DETERMINED KINGDOM set a pressured pace on the inside in the two path, kicked away leaving the turn and then drew off to prove much the best, ridden
out. EMBOLDEN was reluctant to load, chased the pace between rivals on the turn, then rallied well for the place award, no match for the winner. UNCLE
ANDREW pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the drive, bested rest. BOLDOR chased the pace three wide, steadied by the three eighths marker,
came four wide into the lane and had no rally. TAPIO was settled early, four wide by the quarter pole, angled in leaving the turn and had no rally.
BOONDOGGLE tracked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn but was empty in the drive. CHEATIN SONG was off slowly and not a threat.
KENNY HAD A NOTION was well placed on the inside and weakened. SHASTREE was not a factor. IMAGOODFELLA failed to menace.

Footnotes
GALILEI stalked the pace to midway on the far turn, angled three wide under an early drive to commence a determined rally in the stretch and take a clear
lead at the wire. TUFANI broke alertly to take the lead, set a well rated pace, dug-in when engaged in upper stretch and was overtaken deep in the lane.
CONTINENTALCONGRES prompted the pace to the far turn, rallied two wide to engage the leader at the quarter pole, was out-finished late in the lane and
kept on gamely to hold the show. BODE'S HERITAGE saved ground while tracking the pace down the backside, angled four wide turning for home and
closed ground down the stretch. SURYA settled in-hand to be at the back of the field, commenced a rally into the turn and made a mild bid in deep stretch.
MY MAGGIE MOO never was a threat at any time. OSA tracked the pace from two wide down the backstretch and came up empty when called upon
entering the far turn.

Footnotes
JAN'S GIRL wide early into the first turn, was taken in hand to drop in to the two path, continued up the backside under a long hold to track the leaders, cut
the corner turning for home and rallied strongly up the fence to prevail. TIC TIC TIC BOOM trailed most of the way while rated off the pace, angled out at the
head of the lane and closed with a belated rush to be gaining in deep stretch, and finished as a clear second best. CUPID'S STRIKE broke alertly, took
command while well in hand into the turn, set a well measured pace through the far turn, responded when called upon at the head of the lane but was
out-finished through the drive. CHARMED WAY broke outward leaving the gate, dropped in to press the pace from two wide to upper stretch and lacked a
closing kick. EIGHT DANZAS stalked the pace while racing three wide to the far turn and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
KIT CAN RUN was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, moved out approaching the upper stretch for racing room, made a three wide
bid off the turn to assume command and quickly drew clear, then remained clear to prove best, driving. ANDIE ONE was reserved early two wide, advanced
on the turn towards the inside, angled out leaving the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. C C'S FREEDOM was reserved early on the
inside, split rivals by the quarter pole to advance, then split rivals leaving the furlong marker and was along for the show award. HEARTBURN dueled for the
lead two wide and weakened. FEMINISTA stalked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and was empty. AMORE MOON was allowed to settle
early and dropped back. TIPHARAH was three wide into the first turn while reserved, then came widest into the lane and had no rally. D'ORO BABY dueled
for the lead on the inside and gave way. VOODOO MAMA JUJU was settled on the inside and had no response.
