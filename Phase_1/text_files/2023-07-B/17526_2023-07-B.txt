Footnotes
DEBONNAIRE DUDE hustled to the front to share command from the two path to the three furlong marker then edged away and drew clear in the stretch.
THE GREATEST EAGLE was off the pace in the two path on the backstretch then moved up around the turn and split horses at the top of the stretch to
make a late run but was not enough. RANDOM AFFAIR stalked the pace down the backstretch from three wide then made a bid at the five sixteenths pole
but faltered. MY PAL raced near the back in the early stages then steadily advanced down the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn and flattened
out. FERRARI ROAD sprinted to the front to share command from the inside to the three furlong marker and gave way. CLIFTON PARK trailed the field in
the early stages then made a rail bid around the turn to improve position. MORE ACTION raced in the middle of the pack and was not a factor. MORHAWK
raced in the middle of the pack and was not a threat. FLY BUDDY FLY was off the pace in the early stages on the inside and retreated.

MUCHO GIFTED roused to the front to set the pace, drew clear around the turn and was kept to task in the stretch. PICK A LANE FRANK was off the pace
down the backstretch then dropped to the inside going into the turn to save ground, moved out to three wide in upper stretch to take a late run at the leader
but was not enough. BARLOWS PRIDE broke well, then prompted the pace to the top of the stretch and weakened. CHICKEN N BISCUIT raced near the
back to the turn then moved up from two wide around the turn, tipped in to make a rail bid in the stretch but lacked the late response. DEACON BEACON
tracked the leaders down the backstretch then moved up from four wide on the turn and flattened out. BURBACH saved ground but had to steading going
into the turn, then didn't make a rebid. J P'S WEST ACRES lost his footing at the start and trailed throughout. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS POSTED
INTO THE RUNNING INTO THE FAR TURN, AFTER A REVIEW NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
BISCUIT SNATCHER rushed up to prompt the pace through the turn then angled out to three wide at the quarter pole and cruised by the leaders to prove
best. OMACHE KID raced near the back early then moved up the rail through the turn but lacked room in early stretch and angled out to four wide at the
eighth pole to prove second best. GREY ROGUE was off the pace down the backstretch then made a three wide bid around the turn to engage the leader at
the five sixteenth pole and dueled down the stretch but was outfinished. HAWKWOOD raced in the middle of the pack and moved out to four wide in upper
stretch but lacked the late response needed. CLEARLY MAD went to the front to set the pace for a half then was headed at the quarter pole and fought
gamely in the drive but gave way grudgingly. NO LIMITATION saved ground while racing evenly. MORO APPEAL was through after a half. POLICY LIMIT
never fired.

EUSEBIO sprinted away to set all the pace and just lasted. BORN TO RACE saved ground through the turn then angled out to the two path at the eighth
pole to make a late run but was too late. BRAVO KOLT raced off the pace to the quarter pole and weakened but stayed on to be the best of the others.
IMPASSIONED CLAIM stalked the pace and chased the leaders home. SECRET SURVIVOR tracked the leaders but had no late kick. TIME TO SKIP
TOWN raced wide down the backstretch then tucked in to save ground around the turn but was not a threat. RI' PIN SNAP hopped leaving the gate and was
not involved. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT had a wide trip and was not a factor.

HOYA PARANOYA stalked the pace down the backstretch then moved between horses at the seven sixteenths pole to duel for the lead around the turn and
took command at the quarter pole and drew off. BRAYBRAY shared the command to the the turn then dueled for the lead from between horses around the
turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch and kept on the be second best. JONO shared the command to the turn then dueled for the lead from the
inside of two rivals around the turn and weakened. THOUGHTS OF GOLD tracked the leaders from the inside but lacked room going into the stretch and
finished evenly. RED WES bobble after the start and trailed down the backstretch, made a rail bid around the turn to improve position. AUDACE was not a
threat. DIVINE TASK was off the pace to mid turn and dropped back. BEE EXXTRAVAGANT remained back. A JOCKEY OBJECTION WAS POSTED, THE
JOCKEY OF BRAYBRAY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF HOY PARANOYA FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE QUARTER
POLE, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

strech. INCREDIBE MO was off the pace from between horses to the turn then move out to four wide in mid turn and made a late rally but was no match for
the winner. PUT PUT PUT was off the pace on the inside then moved out to three wide at the five sixteenths pole, was tiring going into the stretch and
drifted in but kept on to hold the show. TIZKANDOIT trailed in the early stages then rushed up to be in contention into the turn, moved between horses at
the three sixteenths pole was forced in slightly nearing the eighth pole and fought gamely to the wire. MY CAIRO KID was off the pace from three wide down
the backstretch then moved up to vie for the lead at the three furlong marker but weakened at the top of the stretch. IZZY IN A TIZZY raced near the back to
the turn then saved ground around the turn and improved his position. DOMERGOO raced wide and passed tiring rivals. NAPO sprinted to a pressured lead
to the three furlong marker and gave way. HELLO WALTZ was off the pace early from three wide to the five and a half marker then retreated. THE
