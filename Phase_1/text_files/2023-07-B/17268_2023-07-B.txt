Footnotes
NOT GONNA LAST sent to lead along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, head in head with rival in upper stretch, responded to urging to
edge clear late. MACHO SAM vied for lead two wide on the backstretch, continued vying for lead on the turn, in range in upper stretch, outkicked by game
rival in deep stretch. HALF HOPING chased leaders two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, entered lane widest and kept on willingly
to hold show. MY SWEET MARY leapt at the start, stalked pace off the rail on the backstretch, continued in the two path on the turn, entered lane in range
and finished one paced. FOR MY BROTHER chased leaders along the rail on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn, began to weaken
midway through the turn and failed to respond in the lane. OMAHA RUTSCH brushed with outside rival at the start, stalked pace three wide on the
backstretch, continued wide on the turn and lacked a serious bid in the lane.
