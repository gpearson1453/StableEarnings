Footnotes
BUSTIN AWAY stumbled at the start but broke on top despite it, showed the way lightly coaxed just off the inside down the backstretch under pressure from
AGGELOS THE GREAT to the outside, settled in hand coming under a firm left grip through the turn remaining just off the inside, came under coaxing near
the quarter pole and continued in the two path into upper stretch under threat from a pair, dug in between foes through the final furlong getting brushed by
AGGELOS THE GREAT a sixteenth out and gamely fended off the pair to prevail by a head on the wire. MISCHIEF JOKE broke out a step at the start and
was corrected, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch roused for the drive issuing a
challenge for the front, dug in head to head through to the finish fighting on gamely but was ultimately bested at the end. AGGELOS THE GREAT hustled
from the gate, prompted the pace four then three wide, got let out spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on to the outside of
the top pair, came in slightly and brushed BUSTIN AWAY near the sixteenth marker, then got shaken off in the late stages while clear for the show honors.
SPLIT STRIKE just off the pace in pursuit four to five wide, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the late going. JAKE'S ORCHARD chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and
passed tired rivals to the finish. EZ ROLL coaxed from the start, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper
stretch and tired. ERIC FROM MIAMI shied in at the start and came under coaxing, chased three wide, got out five wide under coaxing at the three-eighths,
went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MITHRIDATES broke in a step at the start and came under hustling to be forwardly placed
along the inside just off the top pair, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. LOVE THAT BIRD seven then six
paths off the inside in pursuit early on, tucked five wide briefly at the half mile pole before tucking to the two path once in the turn, came under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
INTO THE SUNRISE came away alertly then was hustled, angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action
along the rail on the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop in upper stretch, remained clear into the final
sixteenth and held under strong urging. FAUCI came away in good order then quickly dropped back while showing no speed, angled in late on the
backstretch, shifted from the rail to the three path under urging early on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong,
swapped back to his inside lead outside the sixteenth-pole and finished fast but was too late while up for the place. FLUID SITUATION steadied briefly in
the early going, was rated just off the pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was given his cue at the quarter-pole, moved off the rail inside
the three-sixteenths, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth, gained on that foe late and earned the show. COMEDY TOWN angled out early, tracked the
pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed
kick. KING ANGELO broke out then was slowest into stride, settled towards the rear, went around the turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the
stretch, swapped back to his inside lead inside the furlong marker and gained some but failed to threaten. SOUPER SUCCESS was carried out early,
settled comfortably on the outside, was roused three wide on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and lacked the needed response.

RIVER TAY (IRE) three wide through the first turn, raced three wide down the backstretch before tipping briefly to the two path with seven-sixteenths to go,
tipped back three wide through the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch rallying to issue a
challenge nearing the eighth pole, had the rider lose the handle on the crop bouncing it up and nearly caught it a furlong out just before taking command,
dug in under hands and heels only among a host in a blanket finish to the wire getting bumped just inside the sixteenth marker by VOLATILITY and then
returning the bump two strides after and held gamely to the finish kept to task. CATSKILL HUMOR broke a half a beat slow, chased two then three wide
through the first turn before chasing two to three wide down the backstretch settled near the rear of the field, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole
and angled out five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive jostling KATIE'S CHECKRIDE and bouncing that foe around in tandem with ST.
BENEDICTS PREP just inside the eighth pole, then offered up a late surge in tandem with LOOKINFORBARGAINS and missed loosely between foes at the
end. LOOKINFORBARGAINS settled along the inside at the tail of the field through the first turn before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch,
tucked inside once more through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding
her lane through to the finish surging late in concert with the aforementioned foe and missed on the line. VOLATILITY just off the inside through the opening
turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the far turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, swung five
then four wide straightened away into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong out, dug in under a drive bumping RIVER TAY just inside the
sixteenth marker while threatening for command, then got bumped two strides thereafter by that rival while among a host of rivals latched on to the finish
and ran on to the wire missing at the end. ST. BENEDICTS PREP tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung
three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and jostled and bounced around KATIE'S CHECKRIDE in tandem with CATSKILL HUMOR just inside the
eighth pole, angled in when spying a large lane opening and darted to it but was outfinished. KATIE'S CHECKRIDE coaxed from the gate, chased along the
inside until tipped out to the two path nearing the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, swung four then three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
behind rivals looking for a seam when getting bumped and jostled and bounced between CATSKILL HUMOR to the outside and ST. BENEDICTS PREP to
the inside, made no headway to the finish. DREAM FLY grew rank under restraint early on off the heels of KATIE'S CHECKRIDE, settled once able to tip to
the two path with clearance midway on the first turn, tracked along the inside from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing near the quarter pole,
swung four to five wide into upper stretch, steadied in behind foes bumping just inside the eighth pole and then offered no kick. WONDER GIRL coaxed
from the gate, prompted the pace from the two path coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in
the late stages. NURSEKRINGLEDANCES showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch, yielded the front nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late going.

Footnotes
HYDRA moved up near the five-eighths pole to press the pace on the inside of the leader, was eased back off the pace late on the backstretch, raced inside
to the two path on the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied to the lead coming to the furlong marker and edged clear under strong urging.
EVERYONELOVESLINDA went to the front, showed the way under some pressure, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was urged late on that
bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch, fought with two foes into the final furlong and was out-finished while clear for the place. AWESOME INDRA was
hustled from the start, moved out under urging, chased four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch, drifted in late then was taken in hand and
got up for the show. QUICK MUNNY showed good speed while remaining well out in the track, moved in late on the backstretch, vied in the three path on
the turn, took the advantage while set down into upper stretch, was headed by the winner coming to the furlong marker and weakened then was caught for
the show. I'M BUZZY settled under some urging, dropped back leaving the backstretch, moved from the three path to the five path on the turn, came seven
wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead until inside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead and failed to threaten.
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. TRIPLE P
moved out towards the rear early then settled on the far outside, went four then five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path late on that bend, came five
wide into the stretch and was no factor. ICY STARE DOWN drifted out at the start, settled off the pace, was urged three to four wide on the turn, came six
wide into the stretch and failed to respond.

Footnotes
FARADAY angled in towards the rear while taken in hand, was reserved towards the back in the two then three path, came under encouragement in the four
path on the final turn, spun five wide into the stretch then leaned inward a bit, rallied into the final furlong, dove in from behind horses while closing fast into
the final sixteenth and got up inside a bumping duo in the final strides to prevail. SMART UNCLE was bumped in the hindquarters at the start, went to the
front, showed the way on the inside, lost the lead briefly outside the seven-eighths pole, regained the advantage on the second turn, moved clear with five
furlongs to run, was asked with a half-mile to go, saved ground around the final turn, spun off the rail under pressure into the stretch, responded well under a
drive into the final sixteenth, came out one path under a left-handed crop four strides from the wire and bumped hard with SWORE who had drifted in
several paths to come alongside, was taken up through the contact and denied but just held second. SWORE was reserved while saving ground through the
first two turns, came under urging in the two path on the final turn, swung five wide into the stretch under a left-handed crop, rallied outside into the final
furlong, began to drift in when flashed with a right-handed crop coming to the sixteenth-pole, was given one pop of a right-handed crop into the final
sixteenth, came in three paths more while coming to SMART UNCLE under hand-urging, collided while meeting up with that foe who came out one path four
strides from the wire, was taken up while recovering and just missed but was clear for the show. TOOFAREASTISWEST settled on the outside in the three
to four path without the benefit of cover, was roused on the final turn, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and was out-kicked. TYPHOON LAGOON was hustled from the gate, went three wide on the first turn, settled just off the pace in the two path, was
asked near the five-sixteenths pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. SACRED RHYME broke in and bumped with a
foe then was taken up, was reserved at the rear while inside to the two path, moved from the three path to the five path on the final turn, came six wide into
the stretch and was no factor. ASTHROS was asked some leaving the gate, went four then three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, traveled around
the second turn in the two path, was roused three wide on the final turn then driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. WILD
GUESS stalked the pace on the outside in the three path, drifted out while passing the wire for the first time, took a brief and short lead outside the
seven-eighths then lost the advantage again, dropped back with five furlongs to run, chased inside on the final turn and tired. PILKINGTON moved in while
taken under a tight hold near the back, saved ground around the first two turns, was reserved towards the rear, went around the final turn in the two path,
spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BEE WELL was away awkwardly then hustled, went around the first turn in the two path, was well
placed just off the pace on the inside, came under urging late on the backstretch, dropped back while crowded some with three furlongs to run and faltered.

PROVE RIGHT angled in entering the main-track, tracked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the three path on the turn, took the lead just
inside the three-eighths pole, shook clear coming to the quarter-pole then spun four wide into the stretch, was given one tap of a down-turned crop at the
furlong marker then one pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under a brisk hand-ride from that point to the finish.
WARRIOR RICHARD settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and secured the place while unable to
threaten the winner. STREET SWAGG was ridden along off the pace, traveled four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch under the crop and
lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. DANGEROUS RIDE was hustled from the gate, moved in while showing speed, pressed the pace on
the outside of the leader, passed the half-mile pole on even terms for the advantage, vied between horses under urging in the two path on the turn, dropped
back late on that bend and weakened. DEVIL'S CAY moved up after the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost
the lead near the three-eighths, dropped back late on the bend and tired. I RUN settled off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the
two path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and capitulated. SOUND DOCTRINE moved out entering the
main-track, settled on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

the finish. SKI PATROL chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, ran on to secure the place

broke out at the start and put the squeeze on a pair of rivals just after the start in tandem with pressure from ACAMAR to the outside, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside into the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. GAMER struck the near side stall at the start then got squeezed out between rivals just after the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. STJAMES chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ACAMAR came in after the start and squeezed back LUCKY LUCKY LUKE and GAMER against
pressure inside from TIZ A GIANT forcing LUCKY LUCKY LUKE to clip the back of HARRY HOOD, raced four then three wide through the first turn before
chasing four then three wide from just off pace, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, went three to four wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NEW YORK THUNDER angled in while blazing to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while challenged to his outside on
the turn, shook clear when set down into upper stretch, responded well when put to a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, drew off under the crop
while remaining on his inside lead into the final sixteenth, swapped to the proper lead about seventy yards from the wire then was eased up while much the
best. DEER DISTRICT brushed with a rival multiple times at the start then was taken in hand briefly, settled under some urging, saved ground while put to
stronger encouragement on the turn, moved off the rail under a drive in upper stretch and got up for the place at the wire. DREW'S GOLD moved out in the
early going, tracked then chased the pace on the outside, made a bid outside of the winner in the three path midway through the turn, lost touch with that
foe into upper stretch, chased under the crop into the final furlong and proved no match then was caught for the place at the wire while weakening.
GILMORE brushed with a rival a couple times at the start then was taken up while in tight between horses, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went
around the turn in the two path, spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. RYVIT stumbled at the start, was urged along
on the outside, went around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

then two wide coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. TIMO chased just off the inside
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and stayed on one paced to the finish. HIGHEST

and five wide respectively into the first turn, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch
and tired. FIRE BARON got floated five wide into the first turn in a chain begun by BAD LARRY in the two path, chased three to four wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MISTER MOORE stumbled at the start recovering into LASTLY and
brushing that rival in tandem with NOSTALGIC ONE, got floated three wide into the first turn by a BAD LARRY and in turn floated VARIABLE COST and
