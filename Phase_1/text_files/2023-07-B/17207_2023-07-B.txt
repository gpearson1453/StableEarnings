Footnotes
ONE COOL DUDE raced mid pack early on, moved up near the inside past the quarter pole, angled through the stretch run to race five to six deep and
finished well to get up under strong handling. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL settled off the early going, advanced through the far turn three wide, angled out
through the stretch run and rallied for the place position late. LEND IT TEWMEY dropped back off the early going, moved up five wide from the outside of
foes around the far turn and rallied gamely while racing from the outside. VALE stalked the early going, raced three to four wide around the far turn and had
not enough. LOUISIANIMAL was off slowly, quickly rushed up to contention near the rail and weakened the in the final stages. HILLBILLY LOGIC showed
good early speed two deep between rivals and faltered the final eighth of a mile. BOUDIN dropped back off the early pace, raced two to three wide into the
upper stretch and lacked a bid. BABY QUINN stalked the pace, tired readily from the outside and was eased up on in the stretch.

Footnotes
LEGAL TITAN tracked MUGATU from the outside down the backstretch, challenged three wide near the quarter pole, bumped deep stretch by Real Men
Violin and prevailed under all out pressure. REAL MEN VIOLIN stalked the pace, raced in tight quarters early on, took aim four deep through the upper
stretch, veered in deep stretch, bumped rival and just missed in a game effort. MUGATU showed good early foot along the inside and gave way grudgingly
in the drive. NOBLE GENTLEMAN stalked the pace along the inside and raced even late with no closing run racing two to three wide. GENEROUS TIPPER
settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough. THE RUSH IS ON raced mid pack, forced to
check sharply early while racing near the inside and had no late response after the mishap. COMPANY YOU KEEP ran loose in the post parade, raced far
back and was eased. VIVA VOCE clipped heels early on, unseated his rider. THE JOCKEY OF VIVA VOCE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
REAL MEN VIOLIN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH; FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
INCIDENT AROUND THE FIRST TURN, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CAPTIVATED DRAMA showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside, dug in deep stretch and proved best in a determined run under strong
pressure. ATTACHE tracked the early leader two deep, hard ridden through the far turn to challenge the early leader but couldn't get by in a game effort.
DELLACROCE stalked the top trio early on, raced three to four wide in the lane and had no final winning bid. LOTS OF MISCHIEF raced off the early going,
raced two to three wide and had no response. PROSECUTION void of early speed, raced along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and had
no late rally. BOURBON FEVER raced three wide between early on and tired readily.

GOOD BALI prompt the early leader from the outside two deep, engaged in a long battle with British Sea and just got up under all out pressure. BRITISH
SEA showed good early good early foot from the inside and just missed in a long drive in a game effort. ODE TO BALIUS was off slowly, moved up along
the inside near the quarter pole, angled through the stretch to race four wide and rallied gamely to the wire. B D SAINTS was off slowly, raced mid pack
early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and was outkicked to the wire. RULEROFTHEUNIVERSE rated along the inside down the backstretch,
moved up three wide near the quarter pole while being ridden along and weakened in the drive. LEGEND OF THE NILE was off a step slow, void of early
speed and never was a factor. TECHNE raced far back and never threatened.

Footnotes
MAGNIFICENT MILE settled off the early pace, moved up into the far turn, raced from the outside in the lane five wide and finished well to edge clear late
under strong pressure. CUORE SACRO dueled three wide from the outside of foes and kept on gamely to the wire. ENOUGH ALREADY stalked the early
pace, raced near the rail past the three eighths pole, raced four to five wide in the lane and made a good late gain. FASHION KING dueled near the rail
early on and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ZADORO was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack early on, raced from the outside in the lane and
had no late rally. BAYOU SPIRIT dueled for the early lead between rivals and weakened in the drive. TEXAS TOAST dropped back off the early going and
failed to respond. UNCLE HARRY was pulled up to be eased and had to be vanned off.

Footnotes
BHOMA settled off the early going, made an advance towards the leaders through the far turn near the inside, split rivals three deep near the eighth pole
and just got up under all out pressure. BOUDOIR BURLESQUE settled off the early pace, moved up near the rail around the far turn through the stretch and
just missed in a game effort. AALIYAH EZRI stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled five to six wide and finished gamely to
the wire. SWEETS MAKER pressed the early leader from the outside two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. REAGAN'S DECISION showed
good early foot along the inside and gave way in the drive. ENCHANTED NILE rated under a firm hold three deep early and faded. HOLIDAY DECISION
reared at the break, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start and never menaced.
