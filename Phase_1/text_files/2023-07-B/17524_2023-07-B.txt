Footnotes
STAR CANDY had a perfect tracking trip inside watching the contesting pair in the early stages, waited on the fence early in the turn, shifted out three wide
at the quarter pole to pounce on the leaders, extended her stride when asked in the four path outside at the furlong marker and was pulling away crossing
the finish for the victory. EME CLAIRE took control from the start, set the fractions while hounded outside on the turn, put away the pace rival in upper
stretch, could not find more in mid stretch to fend off the closing winner and easily bested the rest at the finish. POPNFIZZ pressed the issue outside down
the backside, continued to prompt up front throughout the turn, was in the hunt in the three path turning for home, faded between runners at the furlong
marker and finished on the wrong lead to the wire while holding on for the show prize in the end. WITCH HAZEL was last in a tightly bunched field three
deep outside at the half mile marker, made little gain on others running three to four wide on the turn, found her best stride late and was gaining on rivals
down the stretch settling for a minor share. I HAVE AN IDEA tracked in the two path with runners on either side at the half, was roused to keep position
between runners three furlongs from the finish, made little headway on rivals on the turn and could not get involved through the stretch to the finish. I'M
INTO MISCHIEF took an awkward step soon after the start, was pulled up quickly and was vanned off back to the barn.

Footnotes
LANTANA LADY prompted the pace from outside, was clear by the three-eighths, held sway while being kept to the task. BURLAP was bumped around
lightly at the start and in tight, settled near the rail up the backstretch in the back half of the field, came out six wide for the drive, ran on well but too late, got
up for second over. ADMISSIBLE , who was forwardly-positioned between runners early, continued to chase in behind into the turn, moved out four wide
turning for home, ran on, lost second. SUPER SICILY was bumped after the start, shifted in heading up the backstretch tracking in behind, went in the two
path on the turn, moved to the rail nearing the furlong grounds, gained steadily inside but needed more. CHERRY GARDENS bumped with a rival at the
start, settled at the rear, swung eight wide into upper stretch, ran on late. SEBADAS moved forward inside to vie for the early lead, continued to chase, was
off the rail coming into upper stretch, needed more late getting outfinished by rivals inside and out. GAMBLER'S POSE was in a bit tight at the start then
bumped with a foe afterwards, raced in the back half and off the inside, came into upper stretch six wide, drifted about a bit, lacked the needed late kick.
DEFAMATION was hard to load, urged at the break, dropped back lacking speed, made no late bid. TOP OF THE MORNIN stalked from outside three to
four wide on the turn, dropped back and faded.

PATCHES O'HOULIHAN was getting out for a few strides after the start, regrouped to take control in hand outside at the five furlong marker, opened up
comfortably through the turn and cruised home unchallenged to the finish in a dominant performance. ONE BAY HEMINGWAY tracked outside in the
second flight down the backside watching the top pair, rallied three wide outside foes with three furlongs to go, looked to be the only one with a slim chance
for the win at the top of the lane but could not gain on the long gone winner through the stretch and bested the rest at the wire. SOONER LUNAR hit the
gate at the break to trail the field down the backstretch, was urged left handed with three eighths to run to get in touch with the field on the turn and finished
up with good late energy to close in and capture third money in the late stages of the race. POULIN IN O T tracked in the second flight on the rail down the
backstretch, was scrubbed on inside at the three furlong marker, could not find another gear between runners at the quarter pole and faded losing third
nearing the wire. ABSOLUTE CHAIRMAN broke sharp for the early lead, chased the frontrunner inside down the back straight, could not keep up with the
winner throughout the turn and retreated on the fence in mid stretch.

Footnotes
DIRECT DRIVE attended the early pace heading to the first turn from outside a foe, was guided out from two to three wide early on that bend ceding the
lead content to stalk, moved willingly to take command coming to the seven-sixteenths, was clear on the far turn, widened in upper stretch under vigorous
hand urging then geared down at the end. FIGHTING IRISH tracked in behind inside the second group on or just off the rail, exchanged minor contact with a
foe late up the backstretch, came out three to four wide turning for home, found room to run, was no match for the winner but second best. MAGNIFICENT
MARIO raced off the pace between runners early, began to advance on the far turn four wide, swung six wide, kicked on mildly. CALUSA DONNIE was
fractious behind the gate, settled inside runners on the rail in the back half of the field, came off the inside on the far turn racing two then three wide on that
bend, ran on. ROCK BULLET lacked early speed bringing up the rear, was ridden along past the half, swung seven wide for the drive and passed rivals.
GOODLUCKMATE was just a bit hard to load, gained forward position outside stalking four wide, ridden for more three furlongs out, lacked the needed late
kick. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was just a bit fractious in the gate, raced between runners in the second flight early going three wide, exchanged minor brushes
late up the backstretch, ran on. HUNGRY WOLF attended the early lead from inside, moved to the fore to dictate terms from the six- and one-half, was
overtaken at the seven-sixteenths, came up empty for the drive. GOLDEN BURN raced outside toward the back three to four wide, failed to menace.

Footnotes
PAINTTHETOWNSILVER hopped at the break, was asked inside just to get position down the backstretch, rallied two wide between rivals at the three
furlong marker picking up horses, swung out to the eight path for the drive to the wire and was full of run late to just get up at the finish in a well timed stretch
run. BABBO broke out at the start, took command to dictate the pace down the backside, put away the early pace rival midpoint on the turn, then repelled
another challenger at the top of the stretch and could not find just a bit more late and was caught by the closing winner at the wire. OSCARSSON was slow
into stride at the start, put in an early move outside runners commencing at the five furlong marker, continued the long sustained run circling foes throughout
the turn, loomed the threat in the two path in upper stretch and stalled between horses at the furlong marker holding for the show money. VALYRIAN SKY
tracked the two leaders at the half running between rivals, kept tabs on the front group on the rail through the turn, was in with a chance inside at the top of
the lane and levelled off in the final eighth. TWO GHOSTS tracked the front two on the rail down the backstretch, was hard ridden trying to keep position
inside throughout the turn, but to no avail backing away on the fence, figured things out at the eighth pole and resurged closing with a good late run but by
that time it was too late. HAWKESBURY pressed the pace outside down the back straight, was roused at the three furlong marker to keep up to the
frontrunner, offered little response, shifted four wide for the stretch drive and finished up evenly to the wire. MOTSKARI tracked the top pair three wide
outside of horses at the half, was scrubbed on trying to keep up with others midway on the turn, floated out to be eight wide turning for home and was empty
in the stretch drive. PIPER'S FACTOR brush the gate at the start, was taken back losing momentum at the nine sixteenths marker, trailed down the
backside, could not reach contention on the turn and passed tired ones in the stretch. SCAT FACTOR was allowed to settle early trailing after the break, put
in a mild run advancing up the fence at the seven sixteenths marker and had little to show in the stretch drive. BANKINGONAMIRACLE stalked near the
rear three wide outside at the half, was urged to go on in midpack four wide through the turn, making up little ground on rivals and gave way in upper
stretch.

Footnotes
FOOLISH GAMES moved clear in the early going and angled in, set the pace racing just off the rail, was clear into the stretch, lugged out a bit late, held
safe. HOT CARGO raced between runners off the leader early, eased back and was guided out at the half, went outside four then five wide on the turn,
drifted in a bit nearing mid-stretch, was brushed late but won the duel for second while not able to get to the winner. ANAM CARA moved forward inside
runners up the backstretch to gain closer contact to the leader, exchanged a few light bumps in the process, appeared to want to get out entering the turn
and steadied just slightly to maintain course, came out three wide for the drive, brushed a rival late dueling for place as the leader came out, missed second.
SOUPER SINCLAIR began with a few awkward steps and a couple lengths slowly, switched off the inside, put to urging on the turn moving out from four to
six wide on that turn, ran on well but too late. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES stalked from outside runners three to four wide, weakened in the stretch. SOUPER
SUNDAY exchanged bumps up the backstretch with the inside foe, steadied slightly at the half then again early on the turn, shifted in and made no late bid.

Footnotes
RAT PORTAGE had a slim lead on the rail down the backstretch, opened up mildly on the turn from his chasers, found more in upper stretch to start to edge
away at the furlong marker and crossed the line drawing off in the end. STAR SCHOLAR stalked near the rear early on, moved up the fence at the half to
have a good inside position into the turn, advanced on the rail midway on the turn, shifted out five wide for the stretch drive and closed in late surging at the
wire to just win the nod for second at the line. SECRET STORM had a good spot nestled behind the leader on the rail, took closer order to the frontrunners
midway on the turn inside, angled just out in the two path to loom the threat straightening out for the drive but needed more late just missing holding for the
place share in a tight photo at the finish. MR. DE was content tracking the top duo three wide outside at the half, forced the pace with five sixteenths to run,
angled in the three path to be in the mix turning for home but was one paced to the wire and settled for a minor share in the end. FOREST STAR was
unhurried trailing the field down the back straight away, started to gain on rivals four or five wide running on the turn, swung out seven wide for the drive to
the line and showed late interest finishing in the last sixteenth. CADFAEL travelled in the middle of the pack between horses three deep down the
backstretch, closed in on the leaders some running three wide on the turn, was bumped by a tiring inside rival turning for home and could not be a presence
down the stretch. SPANISH SERENADE settled near the back of the field with a half mile to run, made little gain on challengers when roused on the turn
and could not get involved through the stretch drive. SMOKIN HOLIDAY bore out at the start, settled five deep in midpack down the backside, offered little
running outside foes through the turn and was not a factor in the stretch. SOUPER GENIUS was shuffled back running between rivals entering the turn to be
near the rear midpoint on the turn and could not regroup to reach contention through the stretch. AMAZON FORESTER pressed the issue between runners
down the backstretch, could not match strides with the leaders on the turn, was hard ridden at the quarter pole and backed through the field in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RON'S GIZMO broke just a half-step slowly, settled at the back outside a rival four wide into the first turn, steadily and slowly advanced up the backstretch
to the far turn, moved five wide on that bend, ground on to take the lead a sixteenth out and edge past. PERFECT CRIME was shuffled back early heading
to the first turn, settled at the back racing off the inside in about the three path through the first turn, moved out and advanced five then six wide on the far
turn following a few lengths off the eventual winner, kept on in the lane to get up for second. LORD OF WAR stalked from outside, moved forward willingly to
take the lead by the five-sixteenths racing three to four wide throughout, led till late stretch, was outkicked and lost place late. CLASSY WHISPER
exchanged light bumps in the early going, raced well back inside but off the rail, dropped back to last up the backstretch, fanned eight wide into the stretch,
kicked on belatedly. MEYER exchanged light bumps heading to the first turn, raced about two wide on that bend off the pace near mid-division, continued
two then three wide on the far turn moving back in a path, rallied inside runners through the stretch but too late. BRITISH ARTILLERY switched off the rail
early, tracked in behind the leaders in the two path, moved out a bit on the far turn under urging and within range, faltered in the stretch and faded. MIGHTY
SEA was up close early inside a foe three deep, continued in range three to four wide on the far turn, failed to rally. SALVATOR MUNDI raced in the back
half of the field three wide, had no rally. MAD DOG N JOE prompted the pace three wide, led briefly near the three-eighths, faltered and faded in the stretch.
HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) exchanged light bumps in the early going, raced inside on or just off the rail, failed to menace. HULLABALOO set a pressured
pace inside on or just off the rail, faded.

READY SHAKESPEARE was content tracking the leader down the backside, was nudged to go on midpoint on the turn, took command between rivals at
the quarter pole, braced for the outside challenge at the top of the lane, spurted away under left handed urging in mid stretch and was drawing away at the
wire for the win. WICKED DJANGO broke in at the start, watched the top duo running on the fence down the backside, was steadied on the rail nearing the
three furlong pole, waited behind the leaders with five sixteenths remaining, found a seam to run inside in the two path turning for home and ran on through
the stretch to get the runners up share in the end. PROUD RONIN stalked near the rear three deep outside down the backstretch, continued to be at the
back on the turn making little gain, angled out widest in the six path for clear run and closed in strongly late just missing getting the place award at the wire.
CHASING TROUBLE travelled near the rear on the rail, trailed the field while on hold inside though the turn, slipped up the fence at the top of the stretch
and had late energy to close in and win the battle for the minors at the wire. KID MARVELOUS was brushed on the break, settled at the back early on in no
rush, was checked mildly at the eleven sixteenths pole, advanced between horses at the half, rallied around runners four wide throughout the turn, was nose
to nose outside the winner in upper stretch but stalled at the furlong pole and settled for a minor role. GEE QUE settled in midfield between horses at the
half, kept pace behind rivals with five sixteenths remaining, could see the field when they straightened out for the drive and battled gamely with rivals on
either side down the lane. MAGIC TOMAHAWK was on hold watching the top duo four deep outside down the backside, rallied three wide at the three
eighths pole to be in the hunt between foes at the quarter pole and weakened in the five path at the furlong marker. HEEZESPEEDY stumbled on the start,
recovered to be in front setting a soft pace down the backstretch, was collared by the winner outside at the quarter marker and yielded on the fence in mid
stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #4 WICKED DJANGO AGAINST #8 READY SHAKESPEARE NEARING THE THREE FURLONG MARKER WAS

Footnotes
TOWN CRUISE settled off the leaders stalking from outside four wide, advanced easily late on the far turn outside the leading pair, struck the lead at the
three-sixteenths, was clear by the furlong marker, came out late and just held. CONGLOMERATE was bumped into a rival at the start, settled at the back,
moved out to go three then four wide early on the far turn still with a bit to do, swung widest to be nine deep at the top of the stretch, was flying late while
drifting in a bit and just missed. A THREAD OF BLUE raced three to five wide in the early going while toward the back, went four to five wide on the far turn
moving out seven deep into upper stretch, fought on outside a rival to get show honors. BODE'S TIPSY settled between runners three wide mid-division
early, put to urging on the far turn moving out a bit turning for home, was outkicked for show. DAY TRIPPER settled in behind the leader switching outside
that one on the first turn, moved forward to press up the backstretch three deep and under a hold, weakened lacked the needed lat ekick. MALIBU EDGE
got away alertly, settled in behind the pace tracking inside, needed more. LAST DAWN bumped a rival at the start, settled at the back racing off the rail,
improved position in the stretch. THERE'S NO JOE was keen to move forward, cleared and shifted in to the two path, set the pace from off the rail facing
pressure up the backstretch, moved clear again heading into the far turn, came up empty for the stretch. DANCIN IN DA'NILE was mid-pack outside racing
mostly four to five wide, had no rally. TAPSASIONAL was bumped at the start, saved ground inside off the pace, was never near enough to threaten.

TOUCH'N RIDE had a good trip watching on the fence the contesting pair in the early stages, rallied up the rail midpoint on the final turn, swung out four
wide to bid for the lead in upper stretch, blew on by the pacesetter at the eighth pole and extended his lead comfortably crossing the finish line. OTTAWA
took control on the the rail from the onset, was pressed out running down the backstretch, put away the early pace foe at the three furlong pole, was headed
outside by the winner in upper stretch, offered no resistance and finished on the wrong lead to the wire holding easily for the place share in the end. LEGAL
CATCH tracked the contesting pair outside down the backstretch, was ridden at the three furlong pole, could not catch up to the top pair but did open up on
the rest of the field on the far turn and was one paced to the finish holding comfortably in the end for the show money. RAPPER ZAPPER stumbled on the
break, settled inside in the third flight down the backside, could not keep up with others on the final turn and found something down the stretch and rallied to
the wire for a small share of the prize. COHERENCE broke in at the start, settled near the back of the pack outside, stalked in the third flight outside at the
half, offered a brief run through the far turn to be in the mix for a small share at the top of the lane but levelled out on the fence in the last eighth. WHADDYA
MEAN hopped at the break trailing inside into the first turn, continued to be unhurried seeing the field down the backside, started to gain some momentum
three wide with three eighths to go but could not be a factor running to the finish line. DRYDEN prompted the pace outside in the first turn, hounded the
frontrunner outside down the back straight away, could not keep up with rivals when the pace quicken three furlongs from the prize and backed through the
field at the quarter marker, was eased crossing the finish line and vanned off

TWOWAYCROSSING settled at the back, raced off the inside up the backstretch, moved five wide on the far turn commencing a rally, drifted in a bit in
mid-stretch, rallied outside and in tandem with ENJOYTHESILENT with a head in front and outfinished that one to prevail. ENJOYTHESILENT stalked from
mid-pack two to three wide between runners, came out a bit for the drive, rallied inside of and with the winner but was only second best. EL COHETE
bumped lightly with a rival at the start, moved forward to the lead and shifted in to just off the rail to dictate terms, was outkicked. TOO MUCH TALK moved
forward outside four wide around the first turn and early up the backstretch, stalked just off the leader three deep into the far turn, ran evenly in the stretch.
UPTOWN LIGHTS got away well, ceded the lead to track inside under rating, was held up in behind at the half with nowhere to go, came out in upper
stretch, ran on well but too late. QUIET INTENT steadied on heels heading into the first turn, settled at the back, angled eight wide into upper stretch, ran on
mildly. MIDWAY MISCHIEF was well-placed mid-pack four to five wide throughout, needed more. KILLARY broke a step slowly, raced outside at the rear,
went four wide on the far turn swinging out further for the drive, was never near enough to threaten. UNDER SURVEILLANCE brushed the gate and a rival
at the start, moved forward three wide, stalked in behind shifting in about two deep for the far turn, faded.

Footnotes
WHERE IS ESSA was reined back out of the five pronged battle for the front at the half, was pushed out five wide on the turn by inside rival bearing out,
gathered himself in the eight path for the stretch run and wore down rivals throughout the lane and got up in deep stretch. SOUPER SUNSHINE broke in
brushing the gate at the start, chased the pace down the backside, was bearing out through the turn, angled seven wide for the drive to the wire and closing
with determination to be second best at the finish. YODDHA was void of speed trailing down the back straight, advanced smartly on the fence running on
the turn, swung four wide for the drive to be in the mix of things and gamely got up between foes to capture third. OLD BLUE CLIFF had a slow start inside,
was then hustled on the rail at the five furlong marker to sit behind the pacesetter down the backstretch, chased the frontrunner throughout the turn, bid four
wide turning for home, poked his nose in front briefly in mid stretch and stalled in the final sixteenth. LEGS LIKE GIZMO emerged with the lead down the
backside after an early five horse tussle for the front in the beginning, opened up mildly on foes on the turn, was collared outside at the top of the lane,
fought inside and faded in the last sixteenth. SO CALLED VACATION stalked near the back of the pack between horses the deep at the half, kept pace with
others running five wide on the turn, shifted in to the three path for the drive and showed late interest in the final furlong. PREETZAH'S STAR settled near
the back five deep down the backstretch, shifted in to save ground trailing the field at the three furlong marker, ran on up the fence at the top of the stretch
and passed weary runners down the lane. MIDNIGHT MOONSHINE broke out at the start, was under a snug hold two wide between runners at the half in
midfield, put in an early move for position between foes at the three furlong marker to be in the mix up front, gave way by the quarter pole and tired at the
furlong marker. GRAND AMBITION stalked near the rear four deep down the back straight, made little impression five wide outside horses on the turn and
had nothing to give down the lane. MR. RUDY broke sharp to have a narrow lead at the start, contested four deep up front early, backed through the field
midway on the turn and was not a factor in the stretch. ASTAPOVO battled three deep for the front in the early going between foes, lost position between
runners at the seven sixteenth marker, was hard ridden midturn, made little headway and stopped in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BONGINO broke in just a bit, had forward position in behind the leaders early, moved to the rail entering the first turn, clipped heels in behind with the
following rival, tracked up close inside, found a seam off the inside at the top of the stretch, engaged the leader, dueled with that one, dug in and got the
nod. STOLEN MONEY moved forward and shifted in facing outside pressure while setting the pace, dispatched that rival and was in command in upper
stretch, engaged by another rival soon after, dueled late and lost the nod. STORMIN DAVE was on the rail heading into the first turn, clipped heels when a
rival came over stumbling badly and losing a couple lengths of momentum, regained stride and raced inside up the backstretch, saved ground on the far
turn and got show honors. DEFOGGER faced some traffic early heading to the first turn, altered outside a checked rival near the three-quarters, advanced
to gain on the leaders but still racing mid-pack two to three wide, came out five wide in upper stretch, missed show. ROOKIE RADAR was forced in just a bit
at the start, raced at the back near inside, came out five to six wide turning for home, ran on mildly. BENLION was outpaced in the early going racing toward
the back two to three deep, was forced outside foes advancing on the far turn fanning six to seven wide, ran on but needed more. GROOM LAKE stalked
three to four wide, was within range to threaten past the quarter pole but faltered in the lane. BAYTOWN ELVIS moved forward with the leader pressing that
one from outside, dropped back and faded. BIG RANSOM moved forward willingly after the start, stalked from outside four wide, came up empty. COACH
ABERNATHY stumbled at the start, raced outside at the back three to four wide early, continued four to five wide on the far turn, was eased up through the
stretch once well beaten, crossed the wire and walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF STORMIN DAVE
AGAINST BONGINO ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD BEHIND THE FORMER.
