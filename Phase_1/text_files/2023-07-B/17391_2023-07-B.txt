Footnotes
LANGLEE AVENUE assumed the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, opened up in upper stretch and held sway under steady handling. STELLAR
LUTE lacked speed, was two wide on both turns, swung to the four path in mid stretch and rallied. WE GOT LUCKY saved ground around both turns,
remained along the rail in upper stretch, swung to the five path for clear sailing in mid stretch and rallied. MASTER OOGWAY , rated back soon after the
break, hugged the inner rail throughout, gave way and finished in a dead heat for fourth. FROG PRINCE , three wide entering the first turn, stalked the pace
down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, advanced outside horses in upper stretch, attempted to drift in near the eighth pole, gave way and
finished in a dead heat for fourth. HIALEAH NATIVE prompted the pace outside the winner, weakened in upper stretch and steadied when shuffled back
approaching the eighth pole.

RASCALLY REBEL , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped and was put to a hustling ride, picked up momentum and advanced along the rail
nearing the quarter pole, eased out in upper stretch, closed relentlessly under left handed asks and forged past IRISH WARLOCK in the final yards. IRISH
WARLOCK had speed four deep while in hand, pulled his way clear and dropped in leaving the far turn, spurted away into the lane, kept on under pressure
past mid stretch, stayed on his left lead till deep stretch and just failed to last. GLORIOUS MAHOMES , with the pace inside a trio of rivals heading to the
half, eased out a bit to stalk around the turn, failed to kick on while racing on his left lead and weakened through the final seventy yards. CAVALRY
COMMAND , bumped at the break, forced the early pace three wide between foes, pursued three deep mid turn, shifted five wide for the drive and faded.
HE ROLLS chased the pace between foes and weakened. MUNGO MAGIC , bumped at the break, raced off the pace and off the rail into the turn, dropped
in and faded.

Footnotes
TAUBER edged up heading to the turn and stalked outside a rival, too closer order behind the dueling leaders soon into the lane, tipped out and was put to
pressure, closed in and took command a sixteenth out then edged clear at the wire. BROTHER CONWAY was sent clear soon after the start, dropped in
then set a rated pace, was joined mid turn by INSPIRED IRISH, lost command in upper stretch but stayed on to battle past mid stretch, kept on well and
saved the place. BENNY HAVENS stalked to the inside of the winner, eased out in upper stretch, shifted out wider to work between runners past mid stretch
and finished gamely. PRINCE PERE saved ground, was taken to rate mid turn, advanced inside leaving mid stretch then flattened out very late. MONSTER
MASON , between horses leaving the far turn, took closer order past the three eighths, shifted out four wide to advance outside the winner nearing mid
stretch, switched over to his correct lead but hung late. INSPIRED IRISH moved up early and stalked outside BROTHER CONWAY, moved to engage
heading to the three eighths, dueled, gained a slim lead in upper stretch, maintained the advantage past mid stretch then gave in through the final seventy
yards. REMEMBERING WILBUR , four wide outside runners early, raced three deep mid turn, swung out in the lane and churned on. MARATHONER
bobbled at the break and bumped with CHIRINGO, edged up between rivals then briefly steadied nearing the turn, swung out well wide for the drive and had
late action. CHIRINGO , bumped at the start, rated in last while saving ground, worked outward in the lane but failed to respond.

COCKTAIL DREAMING , five deep leaving the backstretch, circled horses around the turn, was five wide turning for home, closed outside horses and was
up near the finish. SAPPHIRE BEAUTY saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail turning for home, was checked in tight quarters inside the eighth pole,
altered course near the sixteenth pole and closed gamely between horses. AWAY TO RETURN broke a bit sluggishly, was four wide around the turn, drifted
in on horses when challenging for he lead near the eighth pole and failed to sustain her move. THUNDER BOSS set the pace along the inner rail, was
challenged in upper stretch and weakened late. TAP N GLO broke slowly, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and
lacked room most of the final furlong. BIG AMBITION , no factor, raced widest in the stretch and passed tired horses. TWELVEO'CLOCKROCK was outrun.
MO CO GOLD bobbled at the break, prompted the pace in the two path between horses on the turn and gave way in upper stretch. CHEM MAJOR , in the
three path while chasing the pace on the turn, gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
GOOD KNIGHT NILE , in range of the dueling leaders while off the inside, was put to a hustling ride leaving the three eighths, shifted out some and
advanced into the lane, altered back in to bid between runners in mid stretch, moved to a slim advantage to the inside of STORMING CHROME leaving the
sixteenth pole, dueled and held resolutely to the wire. STORMING CHROME , under a firm hold off the leaders into the first turn, steadied along then angled
out to be in the clear tracking three wide, bid three deep near the five sixteenths, gained a short lead past the three sixteenths, battled outside the winner
through the final furlong and just missed in a sharp effort. CRIPPLE CREEK , taken back soon after the start, dropped in and settled, gained along the rail
into the far turn, eased out, circled four wide and ranged up to loom boldly past the three sixteenths but failed to seriously sustain. HUNTINGTON got into a
duel to the inside of OBOY soon after the start, carried that battled through backstretch and around the final turn, stayed on as STORMING CHROME joined
the fray past the three eighths, drifted out while battling past the three sixteenths, drifted back in and impeded SOLOMON'S CHOICE near the furlong
grounds, corrected and gave way grudgingly. WILL'S MUSIC settled off the pace while saving ground, gained some near the rail in mid stretch then
flattened out. SOLOMON'S CHOICE saved ground under rating, took closer order past the five sixteenths, checked sharply when attempting to make a run
in mid stretch then failed to seriously recover. OBOY dueled outside HUNTINGTON, stayed on between runners heading to the quarter pole, failed to kick
on in upper stretch and faltered. Following an objection by the rider of SOLOMON'S CHOICE, HUNTINGTON was disqualified and placed sixth for causing
interference in mid stretch. An objection by the rider of SOLOMON'S CHOICE against the winner for alleged interference in mid stretch was not allowed.

IYWAAN , in the two path chasing the leader around the turn, closed determinedly the final furlong, led late and drove clear. ALL THREES made the early
lead without urging, saved ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and wilted late. DOUBLE CROWN , within striking distance
two wide on the turn, moved to the three path turning for home and rallied. ARMANDO R trailed for six furlongs, swung to the four path entering the stretch
and failed to rally. DONTMESAWITHME , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
SWEET TALIA , with the pace between rivals leaving the chute, was rated back heading to the three quarter pole and tracked in hand, responded when
called upon and bid between foes soon into the lane, cleared near mid stretch then dug in under solid handling to prove best. WATER WITCH , off the pace
while saving ground, gained along the rail heading towards the stretch, eased out pursuing past mid stretch and churned on the inside of HOLDING COURT
to earn the place. HOLDING COURT , three deep leaving the chute, tracked in hand heading to the turn, moved to engage the leader soon after, dueled
around the turn, was floated four wide entering the stretch, corrected and kept up the fight past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards
and lost the place late. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , rank at the break, regrouped and advanced past the three quarter pole to be close up, stalked three wide
mid turn, shifted five wide into the lane, ranged up in mid stretch then flattened out. RED WINE TIME broke slowly, lagged well back to the lane, raced five
to six wide past the three sixteenths and had belated action. HOT CHOICE settled off the pace and off the inside, was under pressure into the lane, failed to
kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. BALLYKEEN set a pressured pace towards the rail, wandered outward holding a slim lead into the stretch, could not
keep pace past the three sixteenths and tired.
