Footnotes
HAIL COLUMBIA dueled inside of CLASSY AND FAST for the lead in opening stages then shook free mid-way around the turn, saved ground entering the
lane, drew off under a drive then finished ridden out in late stages. JERI DAWN was reserved racing in the back, saved ground around the turn, tipped wider
for the drive and cleared second best. CHEER UP tracked the top pair two wide into the turn, hustled up three wide into the lane and produced a mild bid for
a share. CLASSY AND FAST dueled for the lead in opening stages, could not move on with the eventual winner past the midway point around the turn,
continued to chase after rival into upper stretch then gave way. GOLD MAKER took a solid bump at the start but recovered quickly and raced just off the top
pair, tracked rivals around the turn, came under a ride heading into the lane and had no response.

HOT SUMMER DREAM quickly cleared the lead and widened advantage in hand around the turn, saved ground entering the lane then came out a bit wider,
saw I BILEVE creeping up closer near the furlong marker, came under firm right handed pressure, responded and remianed well clear. I BILEVE tracked the
clear in the opening quarter then was ridden along the rail on the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, made some progress on the clear leader then shifted
back to the inside, sustained bid but had to settle for second best. ALMA'S PRINCESS came away in good order then dropped to last, continued in the rear
entering the turn, hustled along three paths wide into upper stretch, ran on and cleared the rest. KENZIE LOU was ridden along two wide through early
stages, raced two paths wide into the lane and had no late response. BEACH BABY was off to a good start and briefly raced up close then weakened off the
early speed, chased the clear top pair around the turn then faded in the lane.

UXMAL sped to the lead at the start and drifted three paths wide entering the first turn, set the pace along the inside up the backstretch, turned back the bid
from UNSTABLE PRINCESS around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, roused for more, responded willingly and drew off. IMPECCABILITY was
allowed to settle out of the gate and remained unhurried up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, launched a rail bid entering the lane and
gained second best. CONTRABANDISTA hopped at the start and came away last, rated just off the pace up the backstretch, hustled up three wide late on
the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and cleared a share. UNSTABLE PRINCE was forwardly placed in opening stages and got carried out a few
paths entering the first turn, remained up close stalking the leader to the far turn, launched a bid for command three furlongs from home, raced in strong
contention but could not reach the eventual winner and weakened in the lane. LIBERTY'S HAULER was away in good order and got carried out a few paths
entering the first turn, stalked the pace three wide up the backstretch, began to lose some interest mid-way, weakened and never threatened in the lane.

PURE ROCKET rated along the outside off the early pace although never too far back, picked up the tempo and edged closer late on the turn, dug in three
wide in the final furlong and forged clear late. GOLDEN LUNA dueled with RASSLER for the lead up the backstretch then shook clear entering the turn,
widened to a clear advantage and saved ground, continued clear a furlong out then got outkicked in deep stretch. LUCKY DUDE tracked the top pair up the
backstretch, launched a bid in the two path near the quarter pole, swung three wide into the lane, sustained a solid bid and cleared show. OCEAN RIDE
raced in range along the inside, hustled up on the rail around the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way. HERZEN lacked speed and raced
in the back, hustled along two wide into the lane and made some mild progress without threatening. REPLETE rated between foes in early stages, was
ridden along two wide around the turn and into upper stretch but failed to kick on. RASSLER dueled with GOLDEN LUNA for the early lead, chased rival
around the turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FLEET OF HOOF sped to the lead at the start and quickly established the early lead, saved ground and held clear around the first turn, set soft fractions on
top through early stages, continued clear and remained confidently handled and raced in hand when DEADPIRATEROBERTS loomed a threat near the
quarter pole, turned away bid and cut the corner entering the lane, roused for more in upper stretch, responded willingly and drew off to an easy score.
DREADPIRATEROBERTS was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader into the backstretch, edged a bit closer nearing the half mile
marker, came under a ride around the far turn, loomed a threat to FLEET OF HOOF near the quarter pole, failed to reach the leader but continued to chase
after pulling away winner through the lane and finished clearly second best. ONE LAST CHANT raced off the clear top two leaders up the backstretch,
hustled along three wide around the far turn and kept on for a share. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was reserved racing in the back, hustled along three to four
wide into the drive and never threatened.
