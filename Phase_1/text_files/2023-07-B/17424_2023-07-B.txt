Footnotes
GRAN CHEMIN just off leaders early, dueled to far turn with plenty left to stay game to the wire under stout handling while ridden out. SYLLABUS good
position never far back through out with a late kick for place spot. LUCKY SHORE inside position to far turn, game run in the stretch split horses with late
run for the show spot. SPIRITCATCHER no speed to far turn, rallied gamely to improve in the stretch run. SPLIT DECISION saved ground to half, stayed in
contention far turn, faded late. SUPER STORMY chased top pair to far turn, bid stretch, weakened readily late. WASSER shuffled back to last early on,
moved up from far turn no threat. MIDNIGHT FAVORITE speed to front outside, dueled to quarter pole, empty late. WILMORE never threatened throughout.
MISS MATCHMAKER through early, dropped back quickly. EXACTLY WENDY never a menace throughout. LA DAME DE FER through after half and
dropped back readily.
