in the final strides. TWO TIMIN TAYLOR raced close to ONE CORONA FIRE early on, was outkicked by the winner in the final stages and just held for
second. ONE FAST GAME chased the early leaders, was not able to make up ground on the leader in deep stretch, just missed for second and held clearly
at the finish for third. THREE TIMES A LADY chased the early leaders, vied for the lead at mid-stretch, could not match strides into deep stretch and
weakened. LA HUICHOLITA broke a step slowly, could not keep pace heading to mid-stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
LOOKOUT POINT was away a step slowly and was allowed to settle in the early running, saved all of the ground while not far back through the backstretch
run, came within aim nearing the top of the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, responded to firm urging and rallied in the final sixteenth,
confronted BROKEN FINGER in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. BROKEN FINGER tracked the moderate early pace while outside of
rivals, inched closer while three deep along the backstretch run, continued to advance while three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased ON RAGLAN
ROAD into the drive and reeled that one in inside of the furlong marker, led into deep stretch, hung while on the lead in the final strides and was nailed for
the win at the finish, while holding safely for second. ON RAGLAN ROAD was hustled to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions while well rated
through the backstretch run, held foes at bay int upper stretch, was overtaken by BROKEN FINGER inside of the furlong pole, could not match strides with
the top pair in deep stretch and was outfinished, while clear of the rest for third. TRABIESO AVELITO was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked
the moderate pace while outside of ON RAGLAN ROAD, gained ground along the backstretch run and attended to the pacesetter into the far turn, lost a bit
of ground heading to the furlong marker and lacked a response in deep stretch. SYNC was unhurried, raced outside of a rival through the backstretch run,
was steered two wide along the far turn, was coaxed along three wide into the stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
TIGER QUEEN was sent to establish the early lead and set quick fractions into the turn, raced in hand while drawing to a clear lead nearing the quarter
marker, drew off in upper stretch and was geared down in the final stages as much the best. O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke out a bit at the start and crowded a
neighboring rival, chased from the rear while between runners in the early stages, took up entering the turn then angled to the inside and chased from the
rail along the bend, tipped three wide for the drive, was no match for the winner in the stretch run but was able to make up a bit of ground late and bested
the rest. SMOKIN HOT BOBBIE was crowded leaving the start by O'NEILL'S LEGACY and was off a step slowly, chased the fast early pace while outside of
rivals, raced widest to the quarter marker and came five wide into the stretch, was not able to keep pace with the top pair in the late stages but offered a
mild bid in deep stretch and held safely for third. ALL chased the fast early pace while inside of rivals, ran in pursuit along the turn, was not able to match
strides with TIGER QUEEN in upper stretch, gave way in the final furlong and was outfinished for third. RIGHTEOUSLY was prominent leaving the break,
was erratic and a bit hard to place in the early running and lost position heading to the half-mile marker, chased the fast pace three wide to the quarter pole,
was outrun into the drive and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was prominent in the early running and attended to the moderate pace while outside of KERRYGOLD LADY, stalked the
pacesetter into the far turn, was given her cue at the top of the lane and confronted KERRYGOLD LADY, battled with the stubborn runner-up to the
sixteenth-marker, shook free in deep stretch and edged away in the late stages to prove best. KERRYGOLD LADY was sent leaving an alert beginning and
dictated terms in the early stages, cleared to the rail along the first turn and was well rated through moderate fractions along the backstretch run, showed
the way into the far turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, stubbornly fought back against CAN'THELPFALLIN into the final sixteenth but
could not keep pace in the end and was outfinished, while holding well for second. DANGEROUS ILLUSION was squeezed back at the start and was off
slowly, settled outside of rivals along the first turn, made up ground along the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, swung
widest into the stretch run and ran evenly to the furlong marker, lacked the needed late response and was outkicked, while holding safely for third. SPLICER
settled off of the early pace while not far back, saved all of the ground to the far turn, chased within aim into the stretch and lacked a late rally. CALIFORNIA
GIGI was keen and hard to place in the run into the first turn, took back and settled inside of a rival through the backstretch run, trailed into the far turn and
did not factor in the stretch. FANTASTIC SECRET was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the moderate pace while outside of an inner rival,
made up a bit of ground through the backstretch run, came three wide into the second turn, lost position into upper stretch and tired in the drive. THE SIXTH
POST POSITION WAS LEFT OPEN IN THE STARTING GATE.

Footnotes
TORPEDO AWAY took back in the early running and tracked the quick pace into the turn, was steered to the inside and saved ground to the quarter marker,
swung two then three wide into the stretch, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, closed with a rush in the final sixteenth, caught TERRY'S BOY in the
final strides and was up in time for the win. TERRY'S BOY was prominent in the early running and pressed the quick pace to the turn, lost a bit of ground to
HONEYMOONZ OVER along the bend, re-engaged with HONEYMOONZ OVER and battled with that foe to the furlong marker, took a narrow lead inside of
the sixteenth-pole, felt late pressure from TORPEDO AWAY and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while holding safely for second. HONEYMOONZ
OVER was asked to show speed leaving the break and set a quick pressured pace in the early stages, shook free along the turn, was re-engaged by
TERRY'S BOY in upper stretch and battled with that rival to mid-stretch, could not match strides with the top pair in the final sixteenth and was outfinished,
while holding clearly for third. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM was away a step slowly leaving the break and chased from the inside in the early stages, saved
ground to the quarter marker, was outrun into upper stretch and did not offer a late rally. STRETCH RUN was hard to load prior to the start, chased the fast
early pace while outside of rivals and raced widest into the turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SEATTLE BOLD hustled to easily gain the early lead, slowed the pace down to a crawl down the backstretch while keeping all challengers at bay, let out a
notch when AMERICA GREAT made an early bid down the backstretch then quickened away with three furlongs to run and had plenty left to hold off a late
challenge from the runner-up. HONOS MAN reserved from the break, settled in the two path in a tracking position well behind the pacesetter, moved
forward and stayed close up down the backstretch and into the turn, began to rally with three furlongs left, was four wide into the stretch and finished with a
good run but came up short. AMERICA GREAT settled behind SEATTLE BOLD and kept close without offering a serious challenge, pressed the leader
down the backstretch run then came under pressure to keep up approaching the quarter pole, was still in the mix in deep stretch but could not summon the
needed response in the late stages. CONUNDRUM had his head turned and was unprepared for the start, spotted the field a then was able to race close up
to the moderate pace, saved ground to the far turn, looked to be waiting for an opening through the far turn but was unable to keep up as the pace
quickened, tipped out to the four path in the stretch and was outrun to the wire.

DRUIDIC was allowed to settle from the gate then was on the inside of three horses tracking the leaders, stayed to the inside path through the far turn, let
the leaders slip away somewhat then responded when asked to quicken with a quarter mile to go, came up the inside, quickly got the better of the dueling
CANELITO and OH GREAT (IRE) in the last furlong and prevailed by a comfortable margin. CANELITO broke well and was part of the early mix without
being asked, was forced out to the four path by HOT JOURNEY just before the first turn then raced three wide and outside of the trio chasing the leading
pair, launched a rally from the half-mile pole, engaged OH GREAT (IRE) at the top of the stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, could not
keep pace with DRUIDIC in deep stretch, was outfinished and just held for second at the finish. OH GREAT (IRE) was hustled forward from the break then
got good inside position and cleared off through the first turn, was then pressed by HOT JOURNEY down the backstretch but racing in hand, left that rival
behind with three furlongs to run and dueled down the stretch with CANELITO to the outside, dug in gamely, could not hold off the charging DRUIDIC on the
inside and was out-nodded for the place. MOOGIE SON bobbled at the start, the settled behind while saving ground, was inside of three horses chasing the
pacesetters, moved up down the backstretch run then came under a heavy ride from the seven-sixteenths pole and finished evenly but well short of a minor
award. HOT JOURNEY was keen to go from the break, raced three wide into the clubhouse turn, squeezed between horses to take a tracking position right
behind OH GREAT (IRE), pressed that one just off the flank and to the outside, was pushed to keep up from the three-eighths marker but was unable to do
so and tired badly in the stretch. JOHNNY DAR was nudged to a forward position from the start, raced in the middle of the tracking trio down the backstretch
was done by the middle of the turn, swung very wide into the stretch and was not persevered with from there. DO IT FOR DAVE was slow into stride from
the start, trailed the field throughout, was put into a drive entering the far turn but was unable to improve position and struggled home.
