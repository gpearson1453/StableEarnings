Footnotes
MUNDLE OF JOY was quick to begin to cross over to the inside early on setting a clear early lead and remained clear in the stretch run while under steady
handling. ORGANIZED CHAOS was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, rushed up three deep early on, took aim into the upper
stretch but couldn't match strides with winner in the drive. SHE'S DANCING chased the early pace along the inside, continued an inside bid into the upper
stretch and had not enough for the top pair. MINDING MILLIE was coaxed along early, raced three deep into the stretch and never threatened.

ELEGANT TASTE tracked two deep, took command nearing the three eighths pole and held gamely in the drive to prove best under strong handling.
BONITA LASSIE stalked the pace to race in hand early, ridden along three deep nearing the three eighths pole, challenged through the far turn and kept on
gamely to the wire. TEACHER DRAMA settled off the early going, moved up through the stretch to improve position while racing five wide. SASSY MARTINI
raced mid pack early on, was four to five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. FROSTED WILD RIDE showed good early foot from the inside to
the early pace and faded in the drive. FILLMORE EAST was void of early speed and trailed.

SOCIAL SUCCESS hard held early from the outside of Perfect Hideaway, took command near the quarter pole under mild urging into the upper stretch and
remained clear late while racing in hand. DOCTOR ABBIE dropped back off the early pace, raced four to five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to
get up for the place position. SWAN POINT settled off the early going, ridden along three wide near the quarter pole and kept on willingly to the wire.
PERFECT HIDEAWAY showed good early foot along the inside and gave way. BUCKS SOME dropped back early on, raced along the inside and had no
response.

MADI'S TUNE tracked three deep, took command in through the far turn in hand, had a clear lead into the upper stretch and widened under strong handling.
MISS MIA LIA dropped back off the early going, moved up along the inside around the far turn and got for the place position late racing three deep.
SYNDEY GIRL stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and weakened a bit in the latter stages. CHIMING IN
dropped back off the early going, raced four to five wide through the far turn and lacked a rally. WIN FOR LAILA was bumped soundly at the start, raced four
to five wide through the upper stretch and never threatened. PRINCESS WIGGY was bumped at the start, quick to begin to set the early pace and tired
readily.

Footnotes
ONEOFTHEGOODGUYS showed good early foot from the outside racing two deep and drew off to be well clear under strong pressure. BEAR OR BULL
raced mid pack early on, made a four wide bid near the three eighths pole and got up for the place position. BEJUCO vied for the early lead from the inside
and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. BOOK RUNNER was void of early speed, raced from the outside in the stretch and moved up to improve
position. HARVEY SPECTER hesitated at the break, raced three to four wide in the lane and had no rally. SNIP THE ROSES broke awkwardly, raced along
the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch and never threatened. TUNA N STAMPS coaxed along early, raced between nearing the three
eighths pole, checked sharply and faded thereafter. Jockey of Tuna N Stamps claimed objection for interference and stewards ruled no change.
