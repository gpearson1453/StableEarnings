Footnotes
BLAME CATALAYA saved ground around the turn, found ample room along the inner rail through the stretch, closed determinedly and was up late.
SPENCERIAN stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path between horses in upper stretch, bid for the lead near the sixteenth pole and
continued gamely. CLOSERTOTHEHEART lacked speed, raced in the two path between the top pair in upper stretch and flattened out. I HAVE COURAGE
, three deep chasing the pace around the turn, was fanned to the six path entering the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. AND WHISTLE sprinted clear
mid way down the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, drifted wide turning for home and faltered. TOP MULE , in the two path chasing the pace
around the turn, drifted to the five path entering the stretch and faltered. WATCH ME DISAPPEAR , along the inner rail chasing the pace around the turn,
drifted to the four path turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
MAYA PRINCE broke a step slow then settled three wide off of a contested pace, angled five wide under coaxing into the lane, made a grinding run under
left handed asks, joined the duelers from their outside nearing the sixteenth pole, gained a slim lead late and prevailed. INEVTABL CONECTION disputed
the pace two wide outside SHIP THE GOODS, gained a slim lead nearing mid stretch, battled on between rivals leaving the sixteenth pole, kept on valiantly
to the inside of the winner through the final sixty yards but wasn't quite good enough. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN , off a bit slow, was taken to rate well off the
leaders, swung six wide for the drive and leveled off nicely to gain through the final furlong. SHIP THE GOODS sped to the early lead, set a pressured pace
towards the rail, dueled into the lane, drifted out a bit past mid stretch then faded in the final yards. BOURBON READY stalked the leaders three wide, took
closer order four wide under asking into the lane, chased past mid stretch but came up empty late. SCIENCE (IRE) rated forwardly while saving ground,
angled out advancing into the stretch, pursued between runners leaving the three sixteenths then flattened out. R B'S THE BOSS , well back mid turn,
saved ground past mid stretch, altered outside a tiring rival, shifted back in and had some late action. STAR SHOPPING , urged along off the rail chasing
mid turn, briefly steadied behind foes in upper stretch, angled in and gave way.

LONG LIVE NOW , unhurried down the backstretch, moved up three wide leaving the far turn, lugged in under right hand urging near the eighth pole,
remained on his left lead until late and took the lead outside BOBSWORTH approaching the finish. BOBSWORTH set the pace near the inner rail, opened
up on the far turn and tired in the drive. TOAST TO COAST , along the inner rail turning for home, offered a mild advance to mid stretch and flattened out.
STEP AHEAD , three wide the first turn, chased the pace while in the two path on the far turn and gave way. GRANVILLE'S GARDEN broke slowly, failed to
be a factor and was eased through the stretch. RIVER FULL , along the inner rail chasing the pace down the backstretch, faltered leaving the turn and was
eased. SURF CITY GOLD , outrun, was eased.

Footnotes
PATTY CAKES settled well back while saving ground off the contested pace, swung out to be about six wide past the quarter pole, leveled off to her best
stride leaving mid stretch, sustained under right handed asks and forged past POGGIBONSI in the final yards. POGGIBONSI drifted in a bit at the break and
brushed with LADY SERENITY, led early then was headed from the inside nearing the turn, prompted under some rating while between rivals nearing the
stretch, emerged in a battle outside LADY SERENITY leaving the three sixteenths, wrested command soon after, spurted clear under left handed urging
with a sixteenth to go, kept on gamely but wasn't able to fend off the winner's charge. CHROMEPLATED HEART , perched three wide off the embattled
leaders, bid three deep approaching the lane, failed to quicken with the leading duo past the three sixteenths then went even late. KILLY START rated off
the pace, edged up three wide into the stretch, shifted out a bit wider, pursued past mid stretch then flattened out. O SHAUGHESEY , well placed saving
ground, eased out in upper stretch but failed to seriously kick on. LADY SERENITY , brushed with a rival at the break and was off a bit slow, was hard sent
along the rail and poked a head in front heading to the turn, dueled from mid turn to mid stretch then weakened very late. ICE CUBE BABY broke slowly,
had a belated gain but failed to make an impact.

BUCKIN' GREAT disputed the pace outside ANY FOOLS GOLD around the turn, then battled inside EMM ESS EH through the stretch and determinedly
prevailed while drifting out late. EMM ESS EH circled the turn three wide, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and hung. BUCKIN' LUCKY raced in the
two path around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside horses. CLASSY CHICK , a forward factor while hugging the inner rail
around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. BOOTSY'S MERLOT lacked speed, swung outside approaching the eighth pole and passed tired rivals.
ARIEL MOON raced iin the two path on the turn and weakened. CUNDI was outrun. ANY FOOLS GOLD showed speed along the inner rail and gave way
through the stretch.

Footnotes
NAVAL EMPIRE , bumped at the break, edged up early and settled into a forward spot off the rail, responded to asking three wide past the three eighths,
circled four wide with an advance into the stretch, sustained nicely under right handed encouragement leaving mid stretch, forged to command soon after
and eagerly drew out. TEQUILERA cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, failed to contain the winner leaving mid stretch, faded but managed to
save the place. EIDIKOS (GB) stalked outside a rival, gained a bit past the three eighths, pursued between foes entering the lane and gave way grudgingly.
SHE IS WISKY broke outward and bumped with YOUENS, raced off the pace and between runners leaving the far turn, awaited room approaching the
stretch, worked between horses past mid stretch and continued on with good effort. AMPLIO ESQUEMA saved ground, eased out with some progress in
upper stretch, kept on between foes leaving mid stretch then was out kicked. GOLD DIGGING BROAD was lightly steadied nearing the first turn, saved
ground, angled out in upper stretch but lacked the needed bid. MEMPHIS SHOWBOAT , in mid pack, chased between foes near the five sixteenths then
failed to make a late impact. GALS GAL , well placed stalking inside, failed to go on past mid stretch and faded. NICOLAR , three wide heading to the half
mile marker, angled five wide for the drive but failed to generate a run. YOUENS , bumped at the break, lagged back while four wide outside foes, angled six
wide for the drive but came up empty. DAILY PLANET , three to four wide, gave way.

GIVE IT A WHIRL hugged the inner rail around the turn while dueling with SPEEDYNESS, put that one away in upper stretch and drew away while kept to
his business. LOW MILEAGE lacked speed, raced in the two path on the turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied mildly. SURFBOARD stumbled
badly at the break, saved ground around the turn, remained along the inner rail in upper stretch, was taken up in tight quarters inside STREET TOUGH in
mid stretch, altered course approaching the sixteenth pole and gamely split rivals late. SPEEDYNESS disputed the pace outside the winner and gave way
the final furlong. STREET TOUGH broke slowly, advanced three deep leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, drifted in a bit near the
eighth pole and weakened. KRISTINACHRYSALIS , outrun, was eased late.

YOU MUST CHILL secured the inside and a stalking spot into the first turn, patiently spied the leaders as they sparred leaving the far turn, eased out past
the five sixteenths, closed in and bid between foes leaving mid stretch, took command soon after, clear while on his left lead and held firm under a drive.
STREET COPPER settled inside, gathered momentum leaving the far turn, eased out and circled three wide with progress into the stretch, ranged up
outside foes to challenge past mid stretch, flattened out late but managed to save the place. THE ADDISON POUR , unhurried early as a contested pace
went on, was under pressure around the final turn, came four wide for the drive and found his best too late. TOM HAGEN disputed the pace outside
WICKED PRANKSTER, got the better of that one leaving the far turn, cleared off past the five sixteenths, was confronted by the top pair soon past the
furlong marker and weakened late. WOW WHATA SUMMER , pinched back soon after the break, trailed early, raced between runners into the far turn,
shifted out past the three sixteenths and finished with interest. POWER BACK settled in the clear through the backstretch run, made some headway past
the three eighths but lacked any further response. WICKED PRANKSTER grabbed command early and secured the rail, set a pressured pace into and
through the backstretch, ceded command near the three eighths, chased to upper stretch then weakened. PLOT THE DOTS lacked speed, raced three
deep near the half mile marker and failed to respond. CURLIN'S MALIBU , off the pace, saved ground leaving the far turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
GRAN ANDREWS showed speed along the inner rail, dueled down the backstretch, opened a clear lead leaving the far turn, remained on his left lead in the
stretch and held sway under brisk urging. WALK AWAY JOE disputed the pace outside the winner down the backstretch, weakened and held the place.
NEVER CHANGE , shuffled back soon after the break, advanced three deep leaving the far turn, remained on his left lead and flattened out.
UNEQUIVOCAL , alertly taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail there after and finished evenly. SASSY KING , caught in close
quarters leaving the starting gate, swung wide approaching the stretch, had a mild move to upper stretch and failed to sustain the move. SHOOT
THEMESSENGER chased the pace racing in the two path and weakened after six furlongs. OUR HOISTED MAST drifted out leaving the starting gate,
circled the first turn four wide, was three wide the far turn and weakened. ERAWAN stumbled when clipping heels with OUR HOISTED MAST soon after the
break, failed to be a factor and was eased late. HAYNE'S FEVER , five deep the first turn, dropped back entering the far turn and was eased. BADGER
TOOTH pulled up lame mid way down the backstretch and was vanned off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start but no action was taken.
