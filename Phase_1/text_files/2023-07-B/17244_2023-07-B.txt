Footnotes
POLLO D'ORO pressed pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, battled heading into the lane, all out to wire and got up late.
CHASING THE VISION went to lead in between rivals on the backstretch, went to rail heading into the turn, continued to lead on the turn, held a narrow
advantage heading into the lane, dug in under urging and nailed in the last couple jumps. HOLYJAZZ pressed pace early, tried to hold rail but had to cede
the rail, continued to chased along the inside on the turn, a tad in tight heading into the lane, found room and kept on while unable to catch leaders.
MISSING MAURICE bit slow and dropped back at the start, settled off the pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, entered lane in the
rear, and responded mildly in between to improve. DIVINELY DIVERSE tracked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, launched
a seemingly promising four wide bid at the top of the lane but flattened out mid stretch. HELICOPTER PILOT tracked pace three wide on the backstretch,
continued three wide on the turn, and failed to kick on when outfinished in the lane.
