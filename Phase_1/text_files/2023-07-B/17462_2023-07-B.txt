sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. DEREKA'S BLUFF entered the first turn in the five path
and left the turn outside, steadily progressed through the backstretch and raced close off the rail on the far turn, though, flattened toward mid-stretch.

Footnotes
MAY MAYS CASTLE was bumped leaving the gate and rounded the first turn in the three path, closed to the lead four wide approaching the five sixteenths
pole, dueled clear past the quarter and was steadily handled to hold on. HERETODAYGONMANANA stalked from the four path the first turn then moved to
even terms into the backstretch and dueled from that point, angled in approaching the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted outward and
exchanged contact with TENNIS TAP nearing mid-stretch then dueled the remainder for second. The latter saved ground on the first turn then eased out
into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn but lugged in and exchanged contact with
Heretodaygonmanana toward mid-stretch and was outfinished for second. BLUE MOUNTAIN became anxious in the gate then took over and angled to the
inside to rate the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but was pinched back at the rail approaching the quarter pole, angled out
leaving the turn and showed little further. REAL APPEAL stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and ran evenly in the lane. MAKINLIMMARGARITAS became edgy in the gate then ducked inward and into May
Mays Castle, rated close inside on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little
in the lane. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Heretodaygonmanana for interference approaching the quarter pole, lodged by the
rider of Blue Mountain and as a result, disqualified the former to fourth place for coming in on the latter nearing the quarter pole. In addition, the rider of
Heretodaygonmanana claimed foul against the rider of May Mays Castle for alleged interference in the vicinity of the quarter pole, but that claim was
rejected.

MAGGIE'S GIRL took the lead at the thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was urged away from the five sixteenths, raced at
the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. JUBA BABY rated off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn at the rail and settled for second best. NO DENYING DENIS veered out leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the four path,
picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn then weakened in the lane. EX RATED was forced out at the break
and raced well back inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and passed rivals in the lane. STRONG WILLED
rounded the first turn two deep, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened. LOVE OF
GRACE showed little response through the backstretch. LONG LEGS LOUISE became edgy in the gate and mostly saved ground.
