Footnotes
PADDINGTON was bumped lightly after the start, went to the front, opened up a clear advantage in the two path, was challenged with a half-mile to run,
vied in the two path while inside of a foe on the far turn, shook off that rival near the five-sixteenths, extended the advantage while shaken up into upper
stretch, was put to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, remained under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a
hand-ride before being eased up late while much the best. WHAT'S UP DOC went three wide on the first turn, settled comfortably on the outside, moved
closer midway down the backstretch, was asked with a half-mile to run, chased in the four path through the far turn and proved no match for the winner
while able to get the place. DEPUTY CONNECT broke out then was corrected with a snatch of the left-rein, saved ground on the first turn, tracked the clear
leader while off the rail on the backstretch, gained to make a bid at the half-mile pole, vied in the three path under urging on the far turn, lost touch with the
winner late on that bend and weakened but was well clear for the show. HANG TIGHT broke out at the start, settled on the inside, was urged along on the
far turn, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. CENTAVO acted-up just before the starters button was pushed, charged the front of the
gate, had his head turned when the stall opened, was in the hands of the assistant starter a moment longer then the rest of the field as he tried to lend
assistance, came out a few lengths behind the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the back, was urged two then three wide on the far turn,
dropped to the two path into the stretch and failed to respond then was declared a non-starter post race. INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER was forced out at the
start then taken up while shut-off, dropped from three to two wide on the first turn, settled towards the back, was urged along in the two path on the far turn,
came five wide into the stretch and also failed to respond. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, CENTAVO WAS DECLARED A

SPOOKY LADY coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside and held stubbornly to the finish. VOLEUSE chased just off the
inside until tucked inside through the turn, got lightly coaxed along swinging three wide into upper stretch before being roused with three-sixteenths to go,
rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the end. CERRETTA chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch
and then just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out,
then ran on to secure the show honors. SHAMAN PRINCESS stumbled at the start recovering outwards, raced hard held five paths off the inside from the
five-eighths to the nine-sixteenths, went four then three wide into the turn before tucking quickly to the inside near the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into
upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. BUSSIA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch, weakened. ADMIRE MY CROWN four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing five-sixteenths from home, angled six wide into upper

WINNING CONNECTION was hustled from the gate, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, gained to make a bid leaving the
backstretch, took the lead in the three path midway through the far turn, shook clear outside the quarter-pole, came under a left-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole, shortened stride while remaining clear into the final sixteenth and held under strong urging. YONO came out just after the start and bumped
with a foe, settled on the inside, was roused late on the backstretch, chased inside early on the far then then shifted three wide, was driven five wide into the
stretch then moved out a bit more, kept on well in the final furlong, gained on the winner into the final sixteenth but missed while able to get the place. BOYS
CODE went three wide on the first turn, raced with her his head cocked late on that bend, settled off the pace, chased three then four wide on the far turn,
spun five wide into the stretch under a drive, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and willingly earned the show.
BREAK THE ICE went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, saved ground under urging on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch
and improved position. HUSBAND MATERIAL bobbled at the start then was bumped, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, showed the way
down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was headed at the three-eighths pole, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. STRONG LIGHT
came outward while breaking a bit awkwardly and was off a step slow, went five wide on the first turn, floated out onto the backstretch, settled on the
outside, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and was no factor. ACHILLES HEEL was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn,
settled on the outside, passed the five-eighths under urging, dropped back four wide on the far turn and capitulated. INSPECTOR was hustled from the
start, dropped from the four path to the two path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside under coaxing, made a bid under urging leaving the
backstretch, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left.

UNDERVALUED ASSET three wide in pursuit, advanced on the top pair five-sixteenths from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and was
roused straightened away, took over command with three-sixteenths to go, inched clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held safe coming
inwards in the final strides to the wire. CUPID'S HEART broke out at the start bumping with DEAR LADY and took the worst of it getting away last and
conceding four lengths to the front, chased along the inside advancing under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
offered up a mild kick. ZEITLOS prompted the pace from the two path under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch,
dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. HUNTRESS FOR HIRE coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under
pressure from ZEITLOS to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, got collared at the
three-sixteenths, weakened in the late going. DEAR LADY three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper
stretch and weakened. TO A T chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, made
no impact. VIENNA CODE bobbled at the break conceding three lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased three to four wide under coaxing from
the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

ROSES FOR DEBRA broke out then brushed with a foe, was placed under a tight hold early, stalked the pace on the outside, was let out in the three path
on the turn then asked at the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead under a strong hand-ride coming to the furlong marker, was given one pop of a right-handed
crop while moving clear inside that marker and proved best under a brisk hand-ride to the finish. WAKANAKA (IRE) was hustled from the gate, settled on
the outside, went four wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, chased outside in the stretch and narrowly earned the place while no match for
the winner. BUBBLE ROCK went to the front, showed the way on an uncontested lead, went around the turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole
then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner approaching the quarter-pole and weakened then lost the place but narrowly held
the show. POPPY FLOWER was brushed at the start and carried out some, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came under mild
urging late on that bend, was roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. OUR FLASH DRIVE stumbled
awkwardly at the start and was last to commence, moved up under coaxing to race just off the pace, saved ground on the turn, moved off the rail while
asked for her best in upper stretch and also lacked the needed kick. THE QUARTER-MILE FRACTION WAS HAND TIMED.

wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn through swift splits patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into
upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat and held well and safe to the finish kept to task. PROTECTIVE

six wide into upper stretch and closed well outside to get up for the place honors latching on the winner as he hit the wire. ANNOINTED got bumped at the
start by DIVE BOMBER breaking inwards, chased just off the inside early on before tipping four wide at the nine-sixteenths, continued four wide through the
turn under coaxing from the half mile pole, went seven wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. GENERAL PARTNER
broke out at the start brushing the off side stall and then got bumped by SOCIETY MAN, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and ran on to the finish willingly but was out-finished in the late stages. DIVE BOMBER broke inwards
brushing the near side stall at the start, then bumped ANNOINTED just prior to getting bumped by WORLD FAIR coming in from his outside, chased just off
the inside down the backstretch before tipping four wide through the turn placed to coaxing seven-sixteenths from home, continued four wide into upper
stretch and ran on through to the finish but was out-finished in the late going. DANCING GROOM coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled out three to four wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SOCIETY MAN broke in at the start bumping
GENERAL PARTNER, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two to three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. DAILY GRIND broke out at the start hitting the off side stall and getting
away last conceding five lengths to the front, chased inside briefly climbing under the kickback and was tipped out five wide to clearance nine-sixteenths
from home, went four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung seven to eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
WORLD FAIR lunged slightly at the start and recovered inwards bumping with DIVE BOMBER, chased three then two wide under coaxing from three

Footnotes
TAKING CANDY brushed the outside of the gate while hustled, saved ground while well placed just off the pace, was asked in the two path into the stretch,
rallied to the lead inside the three-sixteenths, led under a drive into the final sixteenth, lost the advantage one stride from the wire but won the head-bob on
the line and gamely prevailed. SCRAMBLE saved ground on the first turn, was reserved in the middle of the field, moved from the rail to the two path on the
far turn, swung five wide into upper stretch then was roused, remained on his inside lead while rallying outside coming to the furlong marker, swapped to the
proper lead inside that marker, closed strongly to draw even with the winner a few strides from the finish, led one stride from the wire but was out-nodded
and denied but earned the place. MERCANTE angled in towards the rear, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, moved from the two path
to the three path while roused on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner
the show. I'M VERY BUSY was away awkwardly, saved ground while reserved towards the back, came off the rail while roused into upper stretch, gained
into a reasonable striking position and improved position but lacked the needed kick. ANTARES was hustled to the front, showed the way on the inside, was
asked near the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch, fought with the winner into the final furlong and gave way. FEARLESS
SOLDIER navigated the first turn in the two path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked with a half-mile to run, chased in the two path on the far turn,
spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. WICO (IRE) traveled around the first turn in the two path, was rated in fourth position, went two then
three wide on the far turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, chased into the final furlong and also came up empty. GRAND GIOMAR STEP (IRE) was
taken in hand early, tugged at the bit under tight restraint in the three path through the first turn, was reserved on the outside, went three wide while roused
on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. HARRINGTON moved in towards the back early, rounded the first turn in
the two path, settled towards the rear, went around the far turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
WET PAINT got bumped at the start when SOUTHLAWN recovered outwards from a stumble, raced along the inside through the first turn before taking to
the two path down the backstretch settled unhurried at the tail of the field, came under coaxing just off the inside at the seven-sixteenths before tipping out
slightly three wide midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch under a drive, closed outside to issue a challenge inside the final furlong latching
on a sixteenth from home, tussled through to the finish, had a mind to hop over the tracks of the starting gate and skipped through them before getting up in
the final jumps to score. SACRED WISH forwardly placed just off the inside through the first turn, tracked the leader in closest aim three then two wide,
came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and advanced on the front to take over command just inside that station, swung three then two wide
straightened away into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and tussled head to head
clinging to the front until caught in the final strides to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. GAMBLING GIRL three wide through the first
turn, raced three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch offering up a
mild bid, then weakened in the final furlong while along for the show honors. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY coaxed from the start, established the front and
showed the way in hand along the inside through sensible splits and under no pressure through the opening five furlongs, steadily came under increasing
pressure into and through the far turn from SACRED WISH to the outside and was placed to coaxing near the five-sixteenths in response, got displaced
from the front inside that station, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and weakened to the finish. SOUTHLAWN stumbled badly at the start
pecking the ground and recovering outwards to bump with WET PAINT, chased along the inside just of the pace coming under coaxing three furlongs from
home, angled three wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
ACCRETIVE tracked the pace down the backstretch, engaged the leaders in the four path on the turn, was roused between foes in upper stretch, fought on
even terms for the lead into the final furlong, shook clear under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and extended the advantage to the wire under
steady handling. BOURBON BASH settled at the rear of the field, started the turn in the two path, angled five wide outside the five-sixteenths, gained to
make a bid outside the quarter-pole, spun six wide into the stretch, battled on even terms for the lead into the final furlong, lost touch with the winner outside
the sixteenth-pole, swapped back to his inside lead shortly thereafter and proved no match while able to get the place. DAUFUSKIE ISLAND stumbled badly
at the start but broke with his head in front, chased the pace down the backstretch, made a bid at the half-mile pole, took the lead in the three path inside the
seven-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch under heavy pressure, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. A LA
CARTE broke out at the start, was urged along on the outside, went five then six wide on the turn, dropped back to the five path into the stretch and lacked
the needed response. BEZOS was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the advantage while along the rail inside the
seven-sixteenths, dropped back under a drive into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SAINT SELBY dueled from the five path down the backstretch with CATCHYASOON to the inside, tucked to the two path into the turn and steadily shook off
his main pace rival midway on the bend to slip away when spinning five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive coming under growing threat to the
outside and drifted out three paths a furlong out before being corrected and engaging his main danger eye to eye inside that station, then repelled the
challenge to inch away in the late stages and prevail. SEVEN NATION ARMY chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge a furlong from home, dug in latched on to the sixteenth marker, then got rebuffed through to
the finish while running on clear for the place honors. SENOR JOBIM coaxed from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch
before tucking to the two path through the turn getting placed to coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch, stayed on same
paced to the finish to procure the show honors. CATCHYASOON coaxed from the gate, dueled from the three path with SAINT SELBY to his outside down
the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and began to get shaken off midway, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into
upper stretch and weakened. DIGITAL FUTURE coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. JUST CALL RAY coaxed from the start, chased just off the
inside until tucked inside into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. PRINCE JAMES seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into
upper stretch and tired. AIR SHOW chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
STEINBECK a bit fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased eight paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn,
went eight wide at the top of the stretch and was no threat.
