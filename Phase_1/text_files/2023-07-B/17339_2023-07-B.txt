outside of THREE CARATS, dropped back a bit in midstretch, then came again outside and just missed at the wire. FEARLESS KRISTIE raced off the
pace, moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly and earned the show spot. PEP RALLY chased three wide early,
between rivals on the turn and weakened. CONSEILLANTE was off a bit slow, chased close up early on the rail, chased on the turn and tired. CAST YOUR

Footnotes
ELIKA set the pace on the inside, vied inside on the backside, shook free nearing the quarter pole, responded when roused, pulled away under urging and
coasted the final yards. DERWIN'S PAYNTER raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run and got up for
second in the final strides. GRACE IN MOTION raced between rivals on the first turn, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, came three wide into the
stretch, finished evenly and got third. DUSTED was off slowly, moved up into contention entering the clubhouse turn, vied two wide for the lead, chased the
winner on the far turn and weakened. HURRY UP DEAR raced four wide early, trailed the field and was outrun. VIRTUAL BEAUTY raced three wide early,
then stalked four wide, chased and gave way.
