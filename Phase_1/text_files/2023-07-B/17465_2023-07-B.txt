Footnotes
HARBOR OF GOLD stalked the pace two deep early on, moved up along the inside through the far turn, slipped through along the rail into the upper stretch
and finished well to edge clear under steady pressure. ONE TRUTH was quick to begin to set the early pace, raced just off the inside in the stretch and kept
on gamely to the wire. ON THE CHILL prompt the early leader two deep from the outside and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. SIR STEELE
dropped back off the early pace setters, raced three to four wide in the lane and lacked a rally. GOOD FORTUNE coaxed along from the inside and lacked a
bid. HE'S SO FUNNY was void of speed and trailed.

Footnotes
NORMANDY LIFE showed good early foot to set the early pace near the inside down the backstretch, raced well off the inside in the stretch, edged away
through the upper stretch under a steady hand ride and was geared down late to race in hand. MEXICAN SUGAR pressed the early leader racing three
deep into the far turn and was match for the winner while racing near the rail in the drive. TIME OF OUR LIVES coaxed along early, raced near the inside
past the three eighths pole, angled four to five wide into the upper stretch and was no match for the top pair to race along for third. WILD CREATION was
coaxed along from the inside, continued an inside into the upper stretch and weakened in the drive. QUEEN OF HEARTS dropped back early, saved ground
and never threatened.

finished well to prove best under steady pressure. REFUND RIGLER dueled for the early lead along the inside, raced just off the inside in the stretch and
gave way to winner grudgingly. LAST MINUTE MARIO dueled two deep outside of rival, was in aim inside the eighth pole racing four deep and was
outkicked to the wire. MYSTIC POINT stalked the pace, moved up four to five wide around the far turn and flattened out in the drive. CALCULATED
THINKIN settled off the early going, raced from the far outside in the lane and had no late rally. KING'S HOUSE was off slowly and lacked a bid.

TURNPIKE BOB vied for the early lead along the inside, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure. BEE BY THE SEA stalked the pace, moved up
three to five wide around the far turn, surged late from the outside and just missed in a game effort. JETTIN OUT settled off the early pace, moved up three
wide in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. R GOODTIME CHARLIE pressed two deep and weakened the final eighth of a mile. WOLFINBARGER
chased the early pace, made a three wide bid near the three eighths pole and weakened in the drive. SHOWER THE PEOPLE slow early on, raced near the
inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid. LAVERY was off a step slow, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never
threatened.

MORGANS COVE raced off the early pace, moved up three wide near the three eighths pole, split rivals two deep nearing the sixteenth pole and got up
under strong pressure. NEWSDLEY showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in in late and missed in a game effort. ARROGANTE stalked the
pace from the outside, raced three to four wide between in the drive and finished willingly to the wire. SONG SAVER was unhurried early on, moved up five
wide near the quarter pole, took aim inside three sixteenths pole and flattened out late while racing from the outside. DESI'S REWARD stalked the pace
along the inside down the backstretch, angled to the outside to race from the outside in the stretch and moved up to improve position. NANA'S BOOPA
dropped back early and failed to respond. HOP TO A DECISION was void of early speed, raced from the outside in the lane and never threatened. TRUE
QUEEN tracked the early leader two deep and tired readily.
