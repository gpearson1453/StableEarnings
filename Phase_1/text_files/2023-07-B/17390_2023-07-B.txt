made a bid while lugging in through the lane but prevailed late to prove best, driving. TEXAS PRINCESS broke in at the start, three wide into the first turn
and then settled to the rail to trail the field, advanced on the inside on the turn, steadied nearing the upper stretch, then closed well up the inside to just miss
late. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY broke out at the start bumping a foe, then was keen on the inside while vying for the lead, then relented for a bit, then made a
inside bid to draw clear on the turn but weakened the final furlong. HOLY STAR was allowed to settle on the inside, advanced on the turn on the inside but
lacked a late response. HURRYUPANDBYE was reserved two to three wide, then came four wide into the lane and had no rally. BOBTAIL CANETTE vied

Footnotes
COOL AND COLLECTED set the pace while clear, widened the advantage on the backstretch and then was kept to left handed pressure to prove much the
best. EVEN THE WIND was rated two wide, traffic entering the far turn, then advanced midway on the turn and came four wide into the lane and finished
willingly to be second best and no match to the winner. WOLF HUNTER tracked the winner two wide and was bumped by the three sixteenths but lacked
the needed winning bid, bested rest. J J'S SOLUTION was rank into the first turn and checked and hard to control on the first turn, chased four wide and
made a mild move on the turn but weakened the final furlong. REGIMENTAL was four to five wide on both turns, then steadied on the far turn and then
passed the tiring rivals late, rough trip. MONEY AGENT broke in the air at the start, three wide trip and between rivals then checked and took up by the five
sixteenths and then had no rally. INDIO GUAPO was reserved on the inside and then failed to menace. C V JERSEY BEE was four wide into the first turn,
stalked the pace early three wide and then tired on the turn, stopped in the lane.

GOOD LIKE MAGIC stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid off the turn and went on even terms by the sixteenth marker and slowly edged clear
late to prove best under left handed crop urging. GIMME THE CANDY set the pace while in the two path, dug in gamely in the stretch but could not go with
the winner late, second best. CHISPARRAJOS chased the pace and made a four wide bid off the turn but flattened out, held show award. ADIOS COOL
ARROWS chased the pace on the inside and faded. STANCE chased the pace between rivals on the turn, faded, bested rest. COOGAN was outrun early,
wide on the turn and had no rally. STROPE broke in a tangle, then saved ground while not being a threat. HEDGEHOGINTHEFOG was bumped at the start,
three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SWISS GUARD dueled for the lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and drew clear, then was ridden out to prove much the best. FABRICATOR
was settled on the outside early, three to four wide on the turn while advancing, came five wide into the lane and finished well, clearly second best.
DASTARDLY DEEDS was off slowly, settled back early, then finished willingly up the inside to gain the show award. LIMA ZULU tracked the pace three
wide, came four wide into the lane and weakened. SIMPSON BAY chased the pace on the inside and weakened in the drive, vanned off. LAMELO was
settled early, towards the inside on the turn and was empty. ROUGH JUSTICE failed to menace. SNOWMOBILE dueled for the lead two to three wide and
faltered in the drive. UNCLE DICK was bumped after start and trailed.
