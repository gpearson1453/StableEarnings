MIDNIGHT STRIKES rated along early, loomed boldly through the far turn, raced four wide into the upper stretch and drew off to be well clear under steady
handling. SIR STEELE tracked two deep early on, made a strong three wide bid past the three eighths pole but was no match for the winner in the drive.
HE'S FANCY FREE was void of early speed, raced from the far outside in the stretch and moved up belatedly. WHAT'S HIS NAME dropped back off the
early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch and lacked a bid. BOB'S OUR UNCLE stalked the pace along the inside and faded. TWIST OF FAITH was
sent along from the inside and tired readily.

pace, raced three to four wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire. E T'S SUPER STAR raced off the early pace, made a good rail bid in the
drive and finished willingly to the wire. TACTICAL PLAN was unhurried early on, hard ridden through the far turn, fanned wide into the upper stretch and
moved up late to improve position. BERHANU settled off the early pace, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and weakened a bit late. SHIELD OF
