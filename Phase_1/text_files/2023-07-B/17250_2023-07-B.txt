Footnotes
SILENT MIRACLE had a slim lead three wide outside in the first turn, continued to keep his head in front at the half, was nudged on for more at the quarter
marker to begin inching away from the early pace rival straightening out for the drive and drew away in the late stages for the victory. CONCEALED CARRY
chased between into the first turn, had a perfect set up watching the top two engage down the backstretch, angled four wide to look the main threat but
could not find more to gain on the winner to the finish line. KEEP GRINDING broke sharp to have a short lead in the beginning, contested up front on the rail
down the back straight, hounded the winner inside on the far turn, was in with a chance on the fence turning for home but was outfinished in the final
furlong. ENCHANT ME travelled near the rear three wide in the early going, stalked on the rail at the half, was roused making little impact on the far turn,
angled out five wide for the drive but could not get involved. TRINITY PARK trailed four deep in the first turn, continued to see the field inside down the back
straight, put in a mild advance three eighths from home but could not reach contention running to the wire. THREE SONNY SIDEUP had an awkward start
hopping at the break, tracked four wide outside into the first turn, rated outside near the rear down the backside, was ridden to go on three furlongs from the
wire, could not offer a response and was not a factor through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPIDER BELLE was allowed to settle after the break trailing down the back straight, started to move when shifting out four wide three eighths from the
finish, continued to gain on rivals in the six path turning for home, took control at the furlong marker and held safe for the win. FRANKIE'S GIRL tracked
three wide outside with a half remaining, waited to pounce behind the embattled trio five sixteenths from the wire, finally had clear running room angling out
in the six path with an eighth left to go and was gaining on horses with each stride late but ran out of room. GABBY SQUARED settled near the rear four
deep outside at the half mile marker, offered an early move four wide circling horses with seven sixteenths to go to bid for the lead midturn, gave way to the
winner at the furlong marker and finished up well enough saving third money at the wire. TEMPEREYA pressed the issue outside down the backstretch,
dueled between runners midpoint on the turn, determinedly dug in three wide at the top of the lane and held on for a minor role in the end. BODACIOUS
MISS was on hold sitting on the rail behind the contesting top two at the half, lost some momentum inside with three furlongs to run and could not find
another gear to be a serious threat on the fence down the stretch. NO WHAMMIE set the fractions having a narrow lead on the rail down the backside, was
collared outside by runners midway on the turn, battled until mid stretch inside and backed away in the final furlong.

Footnotes
NEVER SILENT contested for the front with runners on either side at the half mile marker, took the lead in hand outside at the two furlong pole, opened up
in mid stretch and cruised home for the win. SCORED broke sharp to begin, relaxed kindly outside five deep down the backstretch, started to pick up rivals
running three wide on the turn and continued a good sustained run in the four path to the finish to be second best on this day. KEEP THE BLOOM dictated
the pace having a narrow lead inside down the backside, was headed outside by the winner at the quarter pole and faded slightly in the stretch still holding
on for the show money at the finish. GET MY DRIFT hopped at the break, then was hustled to get position four deep down the backside, tracked in midfield
three wide outside keeping pace with the leaders on the turn and was one paced through the stretch. DYNA'S FLATTER lost its path and was steadied in
early backstretch, stalked just off the fence at the half, offered a mild run three wide midturn and levelled off in lane four at the eighth pole. BOSTON MABEL
pressed three wide down the backstretch, could not match strides with the top duo three wide midpoint on the turn and weakened in the four path at the
eighth pole. LANEY GRACE tracked the front threesome on the rail at the half, made little impression on the fence running through the turn and was empty
inside driving to the finish. NACHO GIRL broke outwards at the start, trailed the field down the backside, could not make any headway throughout the turn
and could not get into contention in the stretch run.

Footnotes
MY SUNNY VALENTINE brushed inside rival at the start, then was pushed down on the rail entering the backstretch, regrouped to track the leader under a
snug hold on the turn, loomed the threat shifting three wide between foes turning for home, took control at the furlong marker and was starting to pull away
crossing the line. WINYAH BAY settled near the rear in the third flight outside, put a strong move three wide outside with seven sixteenths from home,
chased the leader on the turn, battled to the wire in lane four down the stretch and got up for place share late. KNOW HOW (GB) stalked in the third flight
inside early on, lost some positioning entering the turn, rallied three wide with five sixteenths to run, shifted five wide for the drive and closed to capture third
in deep stretch. MIMI'S GOLDEN RING broke sharp to lead, angled inside to the rail in early backstretch, set the fractions throughout the turn, was collared
by the winner at the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch losing positions late. SACRED DANCER was bumped at the start, steadied sharply at the
eleven sixteenths pole on the fence to trail down the backside, shifted off the rail midway on the turn, angled out in the six path to be in the mix for a share at
the top of the lane but could not find more to pose a threat to the finish. AMERICAN GAMBLE tracked the leader two deep at the half, was steadied in tight
quarters inside the three eighths pole and could not recover to offer a finish driving to the wire. STEWARDS INQUIRY AND RCOF REGARDING #1

Footnotes
JIMMY'S AFFAIR settled off the pace outside, shifted in early on the turn and rapidly advanced on the leader, bid inside that one taking command by the top
of the stretch, swiftly drew clear in upper stretch and held safe late. NIKITA'S GEM broke a half-step slowly, was ridden along early but lacking speed racing
inside into the turn, swung five wide coming out of that bend, lacked room in behind a drifting rival nearing the eighth pole and altered outside that one,
finished strongly to capture place. SILENT ATTACK was forwardly-positioned inside early, switched off the rail in pursuit of the leader on the turn, swung
five wide into upper stretch, drifted in through mid- to late-stretch and got the nod for show. MAGICAL TRICK was lightly bumped at the start but away near
the front, eased back off the leaders settling inside mid-pack, ran on but missed show honors. DIXIERIBSY raced off the early pace, advanced swiftly
between runners four wide late on the turn to be in contention past the quarter pole, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, ran on but lacked the needed late kick.
GOLDEN SPRING was reluctant to load, bumped the inner rival lightly at the start, moved forward to force the pace outside a foe, edged clear into the turn
racing in the two path, was overtaken leaving that bend, weakened thereafter. PRINCESS O DENMARK veered out at the start losing the outside iron,
regained it and moved forward pursuing from outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came up empty. SPIRIT BEAR was bumped into a rival lightly at
the start and squeezed back, could not keep pace and raced far back early, was never a threat.

LUZ DE LA LUNA tracked from off the pace inside, was encouraged along three furlongs out, switched off the inside midway on the turn, came into upper
stretch four wide and advancing, steadily but slowly gained on the leader taking a narrow lead by the sixteenth pole then inched away late. RUN FOR THE
HILLS shadowed the pacesetter from outside early, pressed the issue then prompted the leader from the half, took the lead at the three-eighths going two to
three deep on the turn, was clear into upper stretch, challenged in mid-stretch while drifting out a bit, outkicked and second best. BASALT STREET broke
well but settled into stride off the leaders, went three to four wide on the turn, had good late effort to close the gap. BREATHING FIRE was bumped at the
start, shifted in racing toward the rear, advanced inside foes early on the turn coming out to the three path by the quarter pole, needed more. THE
ARCADIAN WAY moved forward and quickly to the lead, set a pressured pace inside on or just off the rail, came up empty. STROKES (IRE) bumped a rival
at the start chased in behind shifting in to go in the two to three path on the turn, failed to menace and faded thereafter.

Footnotes
LIVING MAGIC had a narrow lead setting the pace on the rail down the backside, put away the first rival two furlongs from the finish, braced for the second
challenger outside in upper stretch, repelled that one at the furlong marker and continued to be stubborn on the front end to prevail at the wire holding off the
deep closer at the wire. DANCING DUCHESS had a good spot watching the engaging pair early on, tracked with runners on either side at the half, waited
throughout the turn behind horses, angled out four wide off the wall of runners in upper stretch and closed strongly in the final sixteenth to make it a race at
the finish. STORMCAST hounded the pace outside down the back straight, continued to keep the winner honest throughout the turn, started to give way
with rivals on either side at the quarter pole and resurged in the last furlong to capture third in the end. BOLT ENOREE settled near the back three deep
outside early on, was asked to get a better position down the backstretch to track the top duo outside at the half, crept closer to the leaders outside on the
turn, loomed the threat four wide turning for home and stalled under left handed urging in the final sixteenth. CRAFTY OAKS broke in at the start, settled
near the rear inside, was nudged along on the fence through the turn keeping up with the leaders, straightening out for the drive was asked for more inside,
offered little effort and could not be a player running to the finish. PARTY was bumped at the start, trailed on the fence, was hustled to get in contact with the
field down the backside, could not close the gap to runners on the turn and was not a factor in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
COTTON led three deep in the beginning, was content to sit just off the pace outside with four furlongs to go, assumed the lead outside three eighths from
the finish, opened up comfortably in upper stretch and was kept to the task late unchallenged nearing the wire. ARTIE travelled in mid pack two wide down
the backstretch, kept a close eye tracking the top pair throughout the turn, rallied three wide between foes straightening out for the drive, was no match for
the long gone winner but finished up strongly besting the rest crossing the line. TOP OF THE CHARTS broke outwards on the break, was involved up front
in the early stages inside, was taken back at the half to watch the top two contest for the front, tapped on the brakes behind the tiring early leader two
furlongs from the finish, found a seam in the three path in mid stretch and ran on between rivals to collect third money in the end. SCOOT DADDY was
unhurried early outside to trail down the backside, rallied four wide circling runners at the quarter marker to be in the hunt for a share turning for home and
levelled out on the wrong lead to the finish to settle for a minor role. KAWACATOOSE pressed between foes in the early going, had a short lead on the rail
at the half, could not keep up to the winner under a drive inside at the three eighths marker, gave way at the quarter pole and stopped on the fence at the
last furlong. SPITE STORE was brushed inside at the start, stalked near the rear on the fence, lost ground to runners on the the turn trailing three furlongs
from the finish and could not make any impact outside to the wire.

Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART took command at the start, patiently surrendered the lead at the half mile marker, tracked the top pair midway on the turn, posed
the threat in the four path turning for home, wore down rivals to lead in deep stretch and had enough left holding off the closers nearing the wire. SOUPER
FLASHY tracked on the rail on hold behind the top three contesting runners at the half, was shuffled back some inside through the turn, was looking for
running room behind rivals three sixteenths to go, finally found a clear lane at the sixteenth pole and got up late for second. HAPPY VALENTINE had a good
hold outside runners in the beginning, pulled its rider to the lead at the three furlong marker, began to edge away from the pace rival at the quarter pole, was
clinging to the lead with a sixteenth to go and faded very late just missing for the place share at the finish. DIAMOND CRUSH stalked near the rear four
deep down the backstretch, was roused on the turn but made little advance between horses, shifted five wide to be in with a chance at the top of the lane
and finished up evenly in the late stages to get a minor role in the end. IMA BEAST pressed the pace between in the early going, took over the front at the
half, relinquished the top spot at the quarter pole, gamely battled on the fence until the furlong marker and tired in deep stretch losing positions late. I HAVE
AN IDEA travelled in mid pack three deep at the half, offered a brief rally three wide on the turn, shifted out six wide turning for home and yielded in the final
eighth. KAVALA was void of early speed trailing down the backside, made little gain three wide on rivals on the turn, angled five wide four the stretch run but
could not be a factor in the late stages of the race.

Footnotes
COLONEL MUSTARD broke outwards to start, had a good spot three wide tracking the contesting pair up front, pressed just outside at the three eighths
marker, was coaxed to take the lead entering the stretch and drew away when urged in the last eighth. WHERE IS ESSA prompted the early pace two wide
down the backside, was then relegated to tracking the top duo running between horses three furlongs from the finish, had a good shot for the win in upper
stretch but could not gain chasing the winner home settling for second money in the end. VENTI hopped slightly at the break to be near the rear four deep in
the beginning, took closer order outside four wide at the three furlong marker, continued to sustain his run in the four path to pose a threat straightening out
for the drive but needed more in the late stages to to be a factor for the win. MIDNIGHT TEMPESTA stalked near the back of the pack just off the fence
down the backstretch, rallied midpoint on the turn, shifted to the four path for the stretch run and continued to fight on willingly to the finish for a minor share.
MAGNIFICENT MARIO was brushed outside to begin trailing in the early stages, had to tap on the brakes trying to advance on the rail entering the turn,
regrouped six wide running near the back at the top of the stretch and showed good late interest to finish up running to the wire. CLIVE CROSS stalked
outside five deep at the half near the back of the pack, was hard ridden outside midway on the turn and had little to show driving to the wire. ABSOLUTE
CHAIRMAN took this field down the back straight, continued to set the fractions into the turn, was collared by the winner five sixteenths from the prize, gave
way to the leaders at the top of the lane and stopped on the rail the final sixteenth. JACK was brushed inside on the break, travelled near the rear in the two
path at the half mile marker, was asked on the turn losing ground to rivals seeing the field at the top of the stretch and passed a weary straggler down the
lane. GUARD OF HONOUR was nestled on the rail behind the top three down the backside, was ridden for more on the fence trying to keep pace with the
leaders midturn, offered little response and retreated inside in mid stretch.
