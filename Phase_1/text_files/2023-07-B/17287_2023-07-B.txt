SAMAY In hand four wide to the top of the lane, asked, gained to take on the leader and under pressure proved best. MASSEY HALL Close up along the
three path to the lane, angled in, challenged and finished well. BUSTIN PIETRE Set the pace along the two path, dueled four wide midway on the last turn,
battled between a furlong out, stayed on and faded. MASS APPEAL Tracked five wide, dueled midway on the turn on that path, three across a furlong out
and weakened. MASKED MARAUDER Lagged back, saved ground, was not a factor. SOUTH AFRICA Broke in the air, appeared in distress while far back,
pulled up and then walked off.

interest. CANDYROCK In hand along the two path and failed to gain. LABAN M MO Close up four wide after a half mile, stayed that way to the lane and
