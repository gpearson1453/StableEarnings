Footnotes
ANYBODY'S CHOICE prompted the pace from outside early, lost contact briefly with the leader on the turn, got floated out to the four path while reengaging
SHE'S RESILIENT late on the turn, took a bump from that rival at the top of the lane, cleared with a furlong left to run and. SHE'S RESILIENT took control
and set the pace with pressure to the outside, inched clear around the bend, drifted three wide leaving the turn, came out to bump ANYBODY'S CHOICE at
the top of the lane, could not keep up entering the final furlong and lugged out in midstretch, then stayed on to secure the place. SILVER LIGHTENING
raced in range off the the rail then outside a rival into the turn, tipped out to take aim at the leaders then had to move further out to the five path chasing into
the stretch, kept to task through the lane but could not get by the runner-up for second. DON'T GET PICKLED was off slow and bumped outer rival leaving
the gate, chased two wide off the pace into the turn, angled six wide approaching the stretch and failed to threaten. JUST A LITTLE LUCK reared up in the
gate, broke alertly and chased from inside into the turn, remained along the fence to the stretch and weakened. BELLA BABY broke slow and got bumped
by inner rival, trailed two wide into the turn, was not persevered with on the turn, eased through the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
COLONEL VARGO pressed the pace from outside, moved up on even terms around the bend, took over at the quarter pole, cleared in upper stretch, drifted
out in the final furlong and made light contact with PRESIDENT Z late and gamely prevailed. PRESIDENT Z broke out then chased from off the pace, drew
closer four then five wide on the turn, drew alongside the leader approaching the sixteenth pole, got brushed lightly late and could not get by. TOO MUCH
INFO broke a step slow and shifted out in the beginning, stalked the top pair three wide into the turn, bid from outside with a quarter mile remaining and
came four wide into the lane, failed to match strides with the winner nearing the eighth pole and flattened to third. GOLDENSPA was off a bit slow, traveled
near the back early, rounded the bend two then three wide and failed to threaten. REIGN OVER ME was off slow and bothered leaving the gate, took the
turn four then five wide and lacked a response. STRAIGHTEN UP broke a step slow and came in some early, went up to take control while under pressure
from the winner, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
OAKHURST brushed outer rival and dropped back to last before steering inside, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, moved out further in the lane, rallied to
the outside of the runner-up and got up at the wire. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked along the inside out of range, drew closer in the middle stages, roused
two wide at the quarter pole, rallied under right handed urging, overtook FREEDOM LASS in the final sixteenth but got nailed on the line. FREEDOM LASS
tracked in the two path then outside a rival, cut into the lead up the backstretch, headed the pacesetter on the far turn and took over at the quarter pole, put
away inner rival in upper stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth, yielded late and managed to save the show. INFINITE DIAMOND settled inside,
moved into range while continuing to save ground through the far turn, lacked room in upper stretch, gained a clear path past the eighth pole, finished
determinedly and missed the show. SEISAI (IRE) bumped at the start, steered to the inside racing near the back, rounded the far turn two then three wide,
tipped out in the lane and summoned a mild late bid. PARIS PEACOCK (IRE) broke out and bumped rival then got brushed from inside shortly after,
traveled three then two wide well off the pace early, went two wide into the far turn, three wide into the lane and was outkicked in the final furlong.
RUNNINWITHTHEBOYZ took control early and opened up a large lead, remained clear leaving the backstretch, challenged from outside around the far
turn, lost command at the quarter pole and faded out of contention. SHARED FUTURE raced near the back in the two path early on, ridden along two then
three wide on the second bend, trailed into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
JUST NAILS pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the leader into the stretch, came back approaching the sixteenth pole and proved best late.
KISSED BY FIRE set the pace inside JUST NAILS early, cleared that rival entering the stretch, was challenged again by JUST NAILS midstretch and
yielded late. MAKE IT SNOW chased three deep in mid-pack, spun four wide into the drive, put in a late run and was gaining to the wire. LUNAR IMPACT
(GB) chased between rivals early, two wide through the turn, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late. CALABRIAN QUEEN forwardly placed
early on from inside, saved ground through the turn and lacked a late bid. CHRISTINA'S CANDY raced up close between rivals then had to steady briefly
when bothered past the half-mile pole, chased three wide into the lane and could not rally. MO TEMPTATION was off slow and broke out, traveled near the
inside towards the rear, angled out late on the turn and also lacked a rally. SPARROW hesitated and was off very slow in the beginning and trailed early,
saved ground around the bend and could not make an impact. SAREEHA (IRE) settled inside, continued along the fence into the lane and failed to menace.
SIDE BY SIDE became fractious in the gate, chased between near the back leaving the backstretch and was put in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole,
chased two wide into the stretch and proved no menace. SULTRY KITTEN got crowded a bit early, raced between foes off the pace into the turn, raced four
to five wide into the drive and could not threaten. SEAHAWK MARY veered out leaving the gate, chased three deep off the pace into the turn, lugged out at
the five-sixteenths pole, continued wide to the stretch and was not a factor.

moved inside, weakened around the final bend and tired. KISS TODAY GOODBYE got bumped repeatedly between rivals leaving the gate, became a bit
rank when reserved on the first turn and moved inside, trailed on the last turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
OVERDUE unhurried in the beginning and moved inside, tipped out on the far turn and came three wide into the lane, moved out further in the stretch,
unleashed a rally and drove clear nearing the wire. GIVE ME THE LUTE was keen early on when rated in the three path, drew alongside the top pair in the
middle stages, vied three deep around the far turn, cleared in upper stretch but was caught by OVERDUE late. HEMBREE may have broke a step slow but
was content to settle outside a rival at the back, raced three deep up the backstretch, angled out and finished well through the lane to gain the show. IRISH
HEATWAVE raced two wide off the pace then moved inside, steadied early on the far turn, went between rivals then two wide into the lane, split foes twice
in the stretch before having the rider lose his whip and got edged for the show. LIGHT FURY tracked inside and was a bit keen early on, went between foes
on the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, took aim approaching the sixteenth pole and faltered. VANZZY raced in mid-pack four deep around the
first turn then moved into range, remained wide and came four wide into the stretch and flattened out. JACKS OUTLAW reserved in the early going two wide
between rivals, dropped back to last on the far turn and trailed three wide into the stretch, churned on through the lane and improved position. NERO TULIP
(GB) was prominent early and moved inside before going up to take over around the clubhouse turn, set a pressured pace to the far turn, dueled along the
inside through the bend, maintained a short lead over outer pair into the lane, then gave up the advantage in upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong. COMRADERY (IRE) raced mid-pack three deep on the clubhouse turn, went three to four wide around the second bend and proved no menace.
COMMANDER KHAI away quickly from outside and led three wide into the first turn, ceded command to NERO TULIP (GB) around the bend and moved
into the two path, reengaged from outside up the backstretch, dueled from outside on the far turn then vied between foes into the lane and gave way in the
final furlong. MO THEM DOWN stalked the pace from inside through both turns and weakened in the stretch run.
