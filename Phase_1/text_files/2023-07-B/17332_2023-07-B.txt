Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS bobbled at the start, then was reserved off the pace, moved up three-wide nearing the quarter pole, brushed with SHERILINDA
leaving the three-sixteenths pole, took the lead nearing the eighth pole and won drawing clear. SHERILINDA prompted BRILLIANT BIRD while racing
two-wide, came out slightly to brush with the winner leaving the three-sixteenths pole and finished strongly for second. BRILLIANT BIRD saved ground
setting the pace, was unable to stay with the top two late but held on fairly well for third. IN THE RED was close up early racing along the inside, checked
nearing the three-quarter pole lacking room, dropped back slightly while continuing to save ground, angled out 1/8, mild rally. EMERALD SEA was allowed
to settled, came three-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. MS LYNN was unhurried while saving ground and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NAPOLETANO was reserved off the pace while saving ground, angled out to be three-wide entering, then angled in nearing the eighth pole to split rivals
and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. ICE TOWER settled in the middle of the pack, split rivals nearing the three-eighths pole while moving
forward, came three-wide into the stretch, gained a slight lead during the drive but couldn't quite resist the winner. TIME 'ER TOO was allowed to settle,
rallied five-wide the final quarter and finished strongly. REIGN OF SPEED prompted the pace while racing two-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and
finished well in a steady effort. SARGENT KLINE saved ground while being unhurried, came three-wide into the stretch and gained his best stride too late.
MISTER MAFIOSO vied for the lead to the stretch while two-wide and weakened. ICE NEEDS WHISKEY vied for the early lead from along the inside and
gave way after three furlongs. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW dropped back while saving ground and failed to threaten. CONTEJAS gave way after showing brief
speed from between horses.

LADY BRETT saved ground setting the pace in hand and maintained a safe advantage. MISS ACCELERATE saved ground chasing the winner and was
gaining slightly late. I AM YOURS was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. SETTLER'S COVE was forwardly placed
while racing three-wide but lacked the needed late response. AWESOME DAZE dropped back early, came four-wide into the stretch and failed to seriously
threaten. DAREDEVIL PRINCESS was prominently placed to the stretch while two-wide and tired. PHOENICIAN MAGIC gave way after showing brief early
speed.
