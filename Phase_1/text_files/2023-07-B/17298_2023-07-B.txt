Footnotes
MO TRAFFIC broke in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked on the inside, angled out entering the stretch, rallied outside, closed steadily in the final
furlong and wore down DELTA CHARM late to prevail. DELTA CHARM vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, dug in gamely inside when
challenged in the stretch run and yielded grudgingly. CHERISHED WISH raced off the pace inside, rode the rail into the stretch and gained mildly in the
lane. QUEEN JELLY BEAN was bumped and off a bit slow, raced two wide off the pace, came wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. PINK SUNSET
chased three wide, came four wide into the lane and weakened. HOT BOTTOM GIRL vied two wide for command, chased on the turn and faded. IN HER
CUPS was off slowly and steadied, raced two wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
SUTTON VALLEY bobbled at the break, then quickly showed in front, set the pace racing with a clear lead, raced off the inside turning for home, responded
when roused and held well under urging. TROPHY ROOM stalked the pacesetter, chased on the turn, rallied outside in the lane and came up second best.
SUPERSTITIEUX chased four wide early, then three wide on the turn, came five wde into the lane and rallied mildly outside. NOTION TO TAPIT steadied at
the start, raced off the pace, advanced inside on the turn, rallied mildly and got the nod for fourth. CODE NAME BRODY chased between rivals, two wide on
the turn, rallied mildly between horses in the lane and just missed for fourth. LOST A LEGEND chased on the inside, chased on the turn and weakened on
the rail in the stretch. PRUSSIAN BLUE was off a bit slow, outrun early and passed tired rivals on the inside. SEEING RED chased three wide, chased on
the turn and tired. HE'S ON FIRE raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and did not factor.
