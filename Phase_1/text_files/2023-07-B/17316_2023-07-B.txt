MISTER TYRO vied between horses to the turn, inched clear and held off the late charge of SPEND AGAIN to just last at the wire. SPEND AGAIN lagged
early, rallied around the turn, bid five wide, found his best stride late, was gaining fast and just missed. HOMEGROWN LEGEND got away well, vied to the
turn, fell back and held for show. BREAKING THE BANK raced close to the pace, bid inside on the turn and closed well. GIT AROUND BROWN pressed
the pace along the inside, was taken back into the turn, angled out and lost momentum. GOLDEN ZIP was not a factor.

closed well. ACERTIVE MISS raced mid pack, swung wide leaving the turn and got up for show. VIVA LA SECRETA broke out, was unhurried early, slipped
through inside on the turn, bid willingly and was outnodded for show. JUSTABOUTRIGHT bobbled and was in tight at the start, chased the pace and lacked
the needed late response. MARIA ELENA Y. G broke slowly and was pinched back at the start, trailed the field, was not urged and passed a tiring rival.
SHA BLUSH veered out after the start, raced wide early and failed to contend.

DODGEBALL bobbled at the start while getting away well, stalked the pace along the inside, bid between horses on the turn, dueled for the lead and drew
clear late. MAGICAL GOLD raced inside, inched clear entering the backstretch, set the pace to the second turn, responded when challenged to duel and
yielded late to finish second best. IZZY'S G led early, pressed the pace to the second turn, fell back, held safely for show and was clearly best of the rest.
MUCH ALOHA stumbled at the start to be off slowly, trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. YANKEES MIRACLES saved ground in an even effort and
showed little.

BRODIE BABY was last away, moved up to press the pace, challenged for the lead along the backstretch, drew off for a long lead and held safely while
ridden out. PEARLY settled off the pace in a good position, bid willingly and was no match for the winner. STAYTHIRSTYMYAMIGO raced close to the
pace, bid four wide on the far turn to loom a threat, had little left for the drive and settled for show. DIXIELAND CANDY was through after a half, fell back,
tired and stopped into the far turn. FOREIGN CREATION showed little.

THE BANK set the pace with a clear lead and was caught at the wire. TOMMYHAWK was never far off the pace, raced outside, rallied around the turn, bid
five wide, closed fast and was gaining late. POMEROY HAZE stalked the pace along the inside, was checked on the second turn, fell back, came again
inside and finished well in a game effort. ROWDY RASCAL stalked the pace to the second turna, flattened out and dropped back. WRANGLERED showed
good early speed while racing inside, fell back to mid pack and continued to save ground, lacked a bid and dropped further back.

rallied around the second turn, bid six wide, closed willingly and was gaining late. WHERESTHECARTGIRL stalked the pace along the inside, bid along the
rail on the turn, hung late and settled for show. DARETOCATCHLOVE bumped start, was carried out on the first turn, raced outside and lacked a late rally.
SHESTHEBIGGAME was pushed out and bumped at the start, pressed the pace, rallied three wide on the turn, bid and came up empty.
GOTOTHEWINDOW came out at the start, bore out on the first turn, dropped inside on the backstretch, raced evenly and failed to menace.
