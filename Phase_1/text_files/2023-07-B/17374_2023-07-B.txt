Footnotes
GORM tracked the decent early pace from the inside, came in a bit tight approaching the turn and waited for racing room entering the bend, found room
nearing the quarter pole, took command heading into the stretch, drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole and drew away under moderate late urging in a
good debut. MAJOR TOM lunged at the start and was away a bit slowly, chased from the rear into the turn, drifted out approaching the top of the lane and
raced five wide into the stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the final furlong and kept on to be clear in the end for second.
THECHIEFHASTRICKS was prominent in the early running and pressed the decent pace between rivals, lost position along the turn, could not keep pace
into the stretch and ran on in the final stages to secure third. ANOTHER STRIKE was sent to be forwardly placed leaving the break, disputed the decent
pace into the turn, set pressured fractions to the quarter marker, could not match strides with GORM into upper stretch, gave way in the final stages and
was outfinished for third. SMUGGLER'S COVE broke alertly and disputed the decent early pace with an inner rival, pressed the pace four wide to the
quarter marker, lost ground into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong.

MIGHTY MATT tracked the solid pace while saving ground, angled three wide for the drive, responded to urging at mid-stretch and confronted DUMB LUCK
nearing the sixteenth-marker, drew to even terms and dueled DUMB LUCK in deep stretch, wore that one down in the final strides and won the nod on the
wire to prevail. DUMB LUCK was sent to establish the early lead, showed speed while setting disputed fractions into the turn, dueled with OBVIOUS along
the bend, shook free from that rival into upper stretch, was kept to task under firm urging to the sixteenth-marker, dug in when confronted by MIGHTY MATT
in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding safely for second. INDIANERA was allowed to settle leaving the break and tracked the solid pace
from the inside, made a mild advance on the turn, was steered three wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong grounds, found his best stride late
and was clear in the end for third. TRABIESO AVELITO chased the solid early pace while outside of a rival, was coaxed four wide into the stretch, closed
willingly in the final stages but was unable to make an impact. OBVIOUS was asked to show early speed and was prominent in the early going, confronted
DUMB LUCK and pressed inside of that rival into the turn, contested the solid pace to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and
weakened in the final stages.

MORO FIRST CLASS broke well and vied for the early lead with SAINT HELEN, gained a narrow advantage passing the half mile to run, extended the lead
through the turn, came into the stretch leading by comfortable margin and won well under intermittent urging. MADAME CAUSEWAY shied when SAINT
HELEN came over after the break, raced close to the pacesetters to the turn, made a mild bid passing the three furlong marker and chased the winner
home, was never a threat but finished well clear of the third horse. SAINT HELEN broke inward and dueled early with MORO FIRST CLASS remained close
up through the turn then began to struggle to keep up thought the turn and was outfinished for second. CHANTELLE was outrun from the break, was never
a factor and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RODRIGOKNOWS was sent to establish the early lead, cleared an inner rival and dictated terms from the rail into the backstretch run, set prompted
fractions while well handled to the far turn, held SEA DOG at bay into upper stretch, responded to steady urging in the drive, kept to task while holding a
narrow lead to the final sixteenth and gamely lasted for the win. SEA DOG was forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the early pace while outside of
RODRIGOKNOWS, kept close attendance to that rival through decent fractions into the far turn, was set down for the drive and kept pressure on
RODRIGOKNOWS to the furlong grounds, was unable to get by the determined winner in the final sixteenth and was denied for the win, while besting the
rest. UNCLE WALT settled just off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the backstretch run, advanced along the rail heading to the half-mile pole,
saved ground to the quarter marker, angled three wide in upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and
was outfinished, while holding safely for third. TRINIDAD was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked outside of the leading pair into the
backstretch run, remained within striking distance while three wide nearing the quarter marker, chased in the stretch and lacked a late rally. ACERO settled
off of the decent early pace, tracked from the two patch along the backstretch run, was steered four wide into the drive and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
MISS IVES was forwardly placed in the early running, raced close to the solid pace heading to the turn, advanced to press BLURSDAY heading to the
quarter marker, kept pressure on that rival to mid-stretch, closed determinedly in the late stages, wore down the runner-up in the final stages and won the
nod on the wire to prevail. BLURSDAY showed speed leaving the break and assumed command in the early stages, set a fast pace into the turn, was
pressed to the quarter marker by MISS IVES, held a narrow lead over that rival into upper stretch, fought back gamely to the final sixteenth, could not hold
off the winner in the final strides and bested the rest. CITY GLITTER bumped with QUEEN MOLOTOV leaving the break, was allowed to settle and rated off
of the solid early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn and was roused six wide into the stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker, made a mild late
bid but was outfinished in deep stretch and just held for third. TESSA (GB) stalked the solid early pace from a three wide position, gained ground while
between rivals and three deep nearing the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch, could not muster the needed response in the final furlong and just
missed for third. SEEMS LOGICAL chased the fast early pace while outside of rivals, raced widest into the turn and gained ground nearing the quarter
marker, was steered four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and lacked a late rally. QUEEN MOLOTOV bobbled at the start then was
jostled by a neighboring rival and was away slowly, recovered to chase the solid pace into the turn, ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, could not keep pace
in the drive and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
CHANCERY WAY bobbled leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to navigate early traffic and assumed command heading to the half-mile
marker, showed good speed and set a quick pace to the quarter pole, drew to a clear lead into the drive, was kept to task under moderate urging to the final
sixteenth and remained clear to the wire. LEXINGTON HUMOR settled just off of the fast early pace, was well placed while saving ground along the turn,
could not match strides with CHANCERY WAY into the stretch, made a mild late bid in the final sixteenth and was up in the final strides to secure second.
BLUE WILDCAT took back to stalk the quick early pace, raced outside of rivals into the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, could not
keep pace with CHANCERY WAY into the stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and was just edged for second, while clear for third. MISS
UNION broke alertly, ceded the early lead and was allowed to settle while not far back heading to the turn, gained a bit of ground while three deep nearing
the quarter pole, lost ground into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. DULCE EMMA was crowded a bit at the start and was off a step slowly, lacked
speed into the turn, raced widest to the quarter marker and was coaxed along four wide into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and did not
threaten in the final stages. DANCE TO THE MUSIC was prominent in the early going and pressed the quick pace into the turn, lost ground along the bend
and chased the pace between rivals to the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
GOLDEN PRAYER broke well, easily gained the early advantage, opened up a clear lead going into the turn while well in hand, quickened away when
asked at the top of the stretch and cruised home the easiest of winners. SURFLINE was hard to load, came away well at the start chased GOLDEN
PRAYER to the turn, had to be asked to keep pace with that one from the five sixteenths pole and was unable to match strides with that rival but ran on well
and was well clear of the third horse. REALLY SATISFYING broke out and made contact with RAY TAYLORS RUMBLE then was outrun early, launched a
bid with about three furlongs to run, floated a bit wide into the turn, was not able to impact the top two in the stretch and held clearly for third. LITTLE
CHEYENNE hopped at the start, trailed early, made a mild mid-race move but flattened out in the stretch. SOUTHERN BLESSING was pushed to keep
pace early, raced close up to the turn, came under pressure with three furlongs to run and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. RAY TAYLORS RUMBLE
came away casually from the gate, struggled to keep up with the field heading into the turn, was outrun from there and not persevered with down the stretch.
