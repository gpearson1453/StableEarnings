I'M SO FUNNY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the lane. BURNT
MATCH bumped with the horse to her inside and then veered in sharply at the break, was urged up to stalk the leaders on the outside up the backstretch,
navigated the bend from the three path and kept on in the lane. I'M BLEU TOO bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to duel on
the inside through the early going, continued to battle while saving ground around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. NATIVE DOLL dwelt at the
start, trailed ten lengths behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made up some ground in the stretch. SASSY BANKER raced
off the pace early, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. HAUTE CHARLOTTE tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of
a mile, came around the turn in the two path and faded from there. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS
DETERMINED THAT HORSE THREE, NATIVE DOLL, HAD AN EQUAL AND FAIR BEGINNING AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN APPLE saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way racing in the two path around the turn
and drew off in the stretch. BRIARTOWN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the
second bend and improved position in the lane. STOMPING MOON saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the far turn in
the two path and was outkicked in the lane. PRIDE OF ARGYLE raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, saved ground
around the far turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. UNSTOPPABLE FORCE hit the gate leaving it, saved ground around the first turn, trailed the
field up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn and never threatened. A LOT OF HEAT raced in the three path around the first
bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the three path and faded from there. FUJIN
raced in the three path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace, moved up while racing in the three path around the far bend and flattened out in the

Footnotes
CRIMINAL RECORD bumped lightly with the horse to her inside at the start, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn, switched outside to began to a bid in upper stretch and gained ground to get up for the win at the wire. A ROZE AND WINE pressed the pace on the
outside early, dueled from the two path around the turn and dug in gamely between horses in the lane to get caught in the final stride. MAYZEE led the way
on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled while saving ground around the turn and battled gamely in the lane, giving way late.
BREWHOUSE stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked in the final furlong.
NOEL'S ANGEL raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was empty in the stretch.
