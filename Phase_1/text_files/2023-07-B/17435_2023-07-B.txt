IMMACULATE HEART had speed from the start, responded with a rapid moved four wide to make the lead entering the stretch and drew off under mild right
handed urging. CASCABRIA never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path and got up for second. SABELLE dueled for the lead between horses two
wide through the turn then was outfinished. BLACK BUTTE trailed into the stretch and found her best stride late outside. SWEET BELEN battled for the lead
three wide through the turn then weakened. FLYING BUSINESS was in tight at the start and lacked the needed response. LA MUNECA drifted out at the
start, sped to the lead, set a pressured pace along the inside into the turn then was used up.

VEGAS PLAYER prompted the pace three wide into the stretch, made the lead inside the furlong marker and drew clear late while drifting under corrective
handling nearing the wire. STRIKING AGAIN away alertly, set a pressured pace along the rail for a half, drifted out to the four path, entering the stretch,
drifted back inward when put to right handed urging past the eighth pole and held on for second. SOMETHING ON TAP close up from the start, closed
ground along the rail through upper stretch, was put in tight by the runner up causing his rider to steady nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good
courage. AGNELLO CITY had good early speed along the inside but lacked then needed response. NIKAO failed to menace. TRANSPIRED was through
after a half. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED STRIKING AGAIN FOR INTEFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH AND PLACED HIM THIRD.

MOMMA K'S BOY was hustled from the start, lacked racing room along the rail early, waited past the quarter pole, shifted out at the three sixteenths pole,
dug in determinedly and got up in the in final strides. RED CHILI PEPPER rushed to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace early, shook clear in
upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner. ROLL ON BIG O pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then faded. TAHLEQUAH JOE went evenly.
VECCHI failed to menace. RADIO SILENT had speed three wide through the turn then weakened. RIVERS OF DENIRO was no factor. JAC'S MUSIC was
fractious in the gate, in tight along the rail at the five eighths pole causing his rider to check, angled out to the five path soon thereafter, got out on the turn
and lost contact with his field.

AZTEC stalked the pace four wide for a half, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch under right handed urging to win
as much the best. CITY OF CLOUDS unhurried while outside, offered a mild bid in the three path on the far turn and finished second best. LAST COOKIE
trailed around the clubhouse turn, moved up between horses before a half then finished determinedly. DOWNTOWN CONNECTOR broke inward bumping
FLAWLESS CAT at the start, settled close up, dropped back to trail on the far turn then passed tiring rivals in the five path through the stretch. BLUNDER
improved position on the fat turn then came up empty. PERMAFROST set the pace through the first turn, chased the leader down the backstretch and was
through after a half. FLAWLESS CAT was bumped at the start, rushed to lead under a strong hold two wide leaving the first turn, dropped to the rail, set the
pace to the seven sixteenths pole then folded.

Footnotes
ALWAYS MISCHIEVOUS stalked the pace along the inside into the turn, angled out, rallied three wide to make the lead at the top of the stretch then drew
off to win as much the best. FLASH OF CHEROKEE trailed into the stretch, swung wide, closed rapidly six wide and finished second best. GRACIE DANCE
allowed to settle, finished with good courage five wide. BANK BUSTER vied for the lead three then four wide into the stretch and faded late.
PASSINGTHEMISTERY pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. MY D'VALENTINE was no factor. CHARLOTTES WAY away
alertly, set the pace two wide to the top of the stretch and stopped late. A NITE IN CAIRO was no threat.
