Footnotes
BIG GINGER was nested behind the contesting leaders on the rail at the half, found a seam in the three path to bid for the lead in upper stretch, lane closed
shortly thereafter at the eighth pole, bullied her through in deep stretch and got up edging away for the win nearing the wire. TIPSY MOON had a good spot
outside watching the engaging pair at the half, loomed five wide at the three sixteenths pole, had a slim lead with a furlong to go but could not hold off the
rushing winner in deep stretch. STOLE THE RING was bumped outside at the break, stalked on the rail near the back of the pack at the half, could see the
field just off the fence straightening out for the drive, shifted out behind horses five wide at the furlong marker and closed with a rush to capture third money.
HUMOR ME JIM broke out at the start, pressed outside down the back straight, hounded the pacesetter throughout the turn in the two path, assumed
control in the four path turning for home, drifted inwards in mid stretch and faded in the last sixteenth. THATSITTHATSALL settled in mid pack down the
backside, was asked on the turn for more making little headway and could not get involved between runners down the stretch. SUMMER SNOW took
command soon after the start on the rail, continued to narrowly dictate terms on the turn, was collared outside in upper stretch and retreated in the final
sixteenth. DIXIE MORNING broke in to begin trailing down the backstretch, offered a mild run midpoint on the turn to contend at the top of the lane three
wide and tired outside in mid stretch.

Footnotes
QUITE READY prompted the pace outside in the early going, was content to chase the frontrunner on the turn, loomed four wide turning for home, wore
down competitors through the stretch to take control at the sixteenth pole and was beginning to draw away crossing the finish line. LONG POND tracked on
the rail in the second flight, advanced smartly on the fence running on the turn, bid between rivals in the three path driving to the wire to take a slim lead at
the sixteenth pole and stalled late settling for the runner up position in the end. POSEIDON STEEL was unhurried trailing two deep down the backside, took
closer order to the pack three wide outside foes, found his best stride late in the four path down the lane and closed with a run to capture third nearing the
wire. THREEFIFTYSEVEN took this field down the backside on the rail, opened up mildly on challengers through the turn, was asked to keep going at the
furlong marker, offered little and faded on the fence in deep stretch. HUNT MASTER had a good spot outside two deep tracking the leaders down the back
straight, was asked to quicken with others to the inside three furlongs from the prize, lost ground to rivals on the turn and was one paced in the stretch drive.
SOUPER CLASSY stalked near the rear on the the rail in the early stages, was urged on the fence showing little interest through the turn and could not
make any impression to the finish.

Footnotes
PIPIT was void of early speed trailing in the beginning, was nudged along outside to get into the race at the half, made a strong move around rivals at the
three furlongs marker lengthening stride, cruised to take control in the four path straightening out for the drive and drew away when tapped right handed at
the furlong marker extended its lead crossing the line for the victory. MATTINGLY had a slim lead on the rail down the backside, continued setting the pace
with a head in front while harassed outside on the turn, could not find another gear to repel the late rush by the winner outside at the top of the lane but did
battle determinedly to the finish to hold on for the runners up share at the wire. GOING UP tracked the contesting duo after the start, was asked for more
trying to keep position inside with three eighths to go, could not match strides with the winner that was rallying outside on the turn, was still in with a chance
turning for home on the fence and willingly finished up to just miss closing in for the place share at the wire on the rail. YACHT BOY forced the pace outside
down the backstretch, was ridden for more to try to take the lead midpoint on the turn, battled with runners on either side at the top of the lane briefly and
faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
ONE MORE BREW sat outside three deep in the tracking trio with three furlongs from the finish, made steady gain on the frontrunner throughout the turn,
was in the thick of things four wide straightening out for the stretch drive, stubbornly dug in between foes at the eighth pole to surge late for the gritty win.
JAMIESTA stalked near the rear down the back straight, put in a good sustained run three wide around horses commencing at the three furlong marker, bid
six wide outside turning for home and stalled in the final sixteenth. ADELAIDE COURT broke out on the break, took this field running up front unchallenged
down the backside, continued loose on the lead through the turn, was beginning to shorten stride in upper stretch, was asking for the wire at the furlong
marker holding onto a diminishing lead and faded late to keep third money in the end. MOMENT OF PEACE chased the loose frontrunner throughout the
turn, closed in to be involved for the battle up front in the three path at the top of the lane but needed more late to be a threat to the finish. JUSTIN'S WAY
settled in mid pack three deep down the backside, was hard ridden on the turn making little advancement, shifted six wide for the stretch run and finished
evenly outside to the wire. MR NARCISSISTIC was roughed up between horses at the break, stalked near the rear on the rail, offered a mild run at the five
sixteenths pole, was briefly on hold inside at the quarter marker, had clear running room at the top of the stretch and had no finish to give down the lane.
MOONQUEST broke in, was steadied soon after the start, trailed down the backside, could not catch up to the field running on the turn and was not a factor
in the stretch drive. PRINCE SUSSEX broke sharp to begin, chased the lone speed early on, could not keep pace between foes with three eighths
remaining and made no impact on the fence through to the finish line.

Footnotes
PONTIAC was just a bit reluctant to load, got away well racing mid-pack up the backstretch, shifted in to about the three path heading to the turn, moved out
a path late on that bend beginning to pick it up, came out wider for the top of the stretch bumping with a rival, bumped repeatedly with that one through the
stretch while dueling late and maintaining a short advantage from the sixteenth pole to the wire. BUCK'S FIZZ was given encouragement at the start but
lacking speed, raced between foes off the pace into the turn, moved out from three to five wide on that bend advancing to be outside the eventual winner by
the top of the stretch, was bumped by that one in upper stretch, came in just a bit and had several bumps thereafter while dueling late, was just held off.
SIESTA BEACH broke outwardly bumping a rival, recovered well to track the leaders from inside, was in behind at the quarter pole, came out and found
room three deep at the three-sixteenths, took the lead by the furlong marker while drifting out, continued to drift out under left-handed urging, was
challenged and overtaken just past the sixteenth pole but fought on while best of the rest. SUMMER COMMANDER was energetic behind the gate and just
a bit hard to load, broke on top and set the pace, faced pressure from an outside foe while racing just off the rail into and one the turn, put away that rival
past the quarter pole but was challenged by another in upper stretch, yielded late. BRAVE DANCER broke outwardly, raced outside rivals toward the rear
going four wide on the turn, kept on in the late stages but just missed the minor award. ALWAYS A WAY was shut off a few strides out of the gate,
unhurriedly brought up the rear a long ways back of the leaders, came out for the stretch run, ran on well but far too late. FOREST WOODSMAN was
bumped at the start, coaxed forward, raced outside a foe in the second group, went two to three wide on the turn coming to the quarter pole four deep and
within striking range, lacked the needed late kick and drifted in a bit through the stretch. RED SNEAKERS broke a step slowly, raced toward the back inside
rivals but off the fence, came out further in the stretch, ran on evenly. CANTUCCI was forced in at the start, raced last but one lacking speed, failed to
menace. VALLEY VICTORY broke inwardly, moved forward to press the pace from outside going three wide on the turn, came up empty. FOLLOWING AN
OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF BUCK'S FIZZ AGAINST PONTIAC, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
PALAZZI was allowed to settle at the back of this small field in the early stages still keeping in close range of the frontrunner, swooped around runners four
deep with a powerful turn of foot on the far turn and took control in the five path in upper stretch to win going away impressively at the finish. MALIBU
MAMBO nestled on the rail watching the pacesetter into the first turn, followed the leader on the fence down the backside, continued to keep pace inside on
the far turn, shifted out in the three path between rivals for the drive and finished up comfortably besting the rest at the wire. HADDASSAH loped along up
front in the first quarter, was left alone unchallenged setting a soft pace down the backstretch, was collared by the winner outside in mid stretch, had nothing
in reserve to battle to the wire and faded late finishing a clear third crossing the line. AVOMAN tracked three wide outside in the beginning, was urged
between foes trying to keep position into the far turn, two furlongs from home was asked for more run, offered little response and could not pose a threat to
the top three to the wire holding on for a minor share only in the end. GOLDEN GLIDER settled in mid pack three wide on the first turn, sensing a slow pace
crept closer three deep outside at the half, made little impact three wide chasing the leader at the quarter pole, shifted out five wide for the drive but was
empty running to the wire. DUN DRUM stalked in midfield on the rail into the first turn, was shuffled back two wide to trail the field when the running started
at the three furlongs marker in this compact field and could not find another gear to be a presence to the finish.

Footnotes
CALL MY BANKER settled mid-pack racing inside, came out at the five-sixteenths, advanced between runners past the quarter pole, came out further for
the drive, took aim on the leaders, struck the front past the furlong marker, drew clear late under steady handling. CEREBRO had the early lead racing off
the fence, ceded it to a rival and switched outside that one to stalk into the turn, went three to four wide on that bend in range, loomed a threat in upper
stretch taking a narrow and brief lead, was outkicked but second best. BOLD RELOAD was bumped lightly then bumped that rival lightly at that start, was
coaxed forward to take the lead past the five-eighths, shifted in and set the pace racing just off the rail, weakened when headed inside the final furlong.
GRAND ALLIANCE exchanged light bumps at the start with the aforementioned, raced off the pace outside runners, moved out from four to six wide on the
turn coming seven deep into upper stretch, improved position. ORPHAN HALLIE was forced in just a bit at the start, settled at the back near but off the rail,
came out in upper stretch, ran on to pass foes eight wide. SOUPER RUSH was forwardly-positioned stalking from outside, went four to five wide on the turn,
weakened in the stretch. SOUPER RIVER raced toward the back off the inside, was not a factor. GENDRAGON was in just a hair tight at the start, raced at
the back outside going four to six wide, failed to rally. STYLISH GENT was forwardly-positioned pursuing from inside, gave way.

Footnotes
READY FOR THE LADY travelled near the back of the pack just outside in the second flight in the beginning stages of the race, rated comfortably three
deep outside challengers with four furlongs remaining, keeping a close eye on the engaging leaders, pushed the button to go three wide midpoint on the
turn, bid four wide between horses at the top of the stretch and drew off out kicking runners in the last eighth. SIR SAHIB was unhurried trailing the field into
the first turn, continued in last at the half but was only a few lengths off in the compact field, waited to pounce entering the final turn, followed the path of the
winner with five sixteenths to go, angled out for clear running in the five path driving to the wire, was outfinished by the winner in mid stretch but closed
strongly to garner second money in the end. LIKE THE KING prompted the pace on the rail in the stretch for the first time, shifted outside two wide entering
the first turn, hounded the pacesetter down the backside outside, battled between to take a slim lead at the two furlong marker, fought on gamely with
horses on either side at the top of lane, saved third money narrowly at the wire while running on the wrong lead through the stretch. ENGLISH
CONQUEROR had a short lead just off the fence in the two path under the wire for the first time, took the field into the first turn on the rail, set the soft pace
up front at the half mile marker, was headed outside by rivals when the pace quicken at the quarter pole, lost the lead at the top of the lane inside in upper
stretch and determinedly fought inside just missing the tight show photo by a nod. ELUSIVE KNIGHT stalked on the rail near the rear in the second flight
into the first turn, watched the front runner tracking inside down the backstretch, was urged to keep up when the running started three furlongs from home,
could not find more on the fence turning for home and was not involved in the late stages of the race.

Footnotes
SIGN OF BEAUTY broke outwardly but nevertheless got away alertly, set the pace inside facing pressure from outside rivals, edged clear past the
three-eighths, drew off in upper stretch under moderate urging, was much the best. THE NIIGON FACTOR was a bit restless behind the gate, broke
outwardly just a bit, tucked in behind the leading trio racing off the pace outside, went three then five wide on the turn, proved no match for the winner but
was clearly second best. GOOD NEWS MONEY was forced out at the start, unhurriedly brought up the rear racing well back, came out seven wide in upper
stretch, belatedly ran on. CANTHO settled at the back, saved ground inside on the turn and improved position. BEAUTIFUL AS YOU broke a step slowly
and in tight, shifted in while advancing up the backstretch, saved ground on the turn to reach striking distance coming past the quarter pole, moved out three
wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. CENTENARY was fractious in the gate, settled outside at the back, made a swift and sweeping move
four then six wide on the turn to reach striking distance but faltered and faded. PEACE IN PARADISE broke outwardly a bit, pressed from between runners,
steadily weakened. CRYSTAL THE PISTOL was forced out just a bit at the start, shadowed the pace from outside, went four wide on the turn, weakened.

Footnotes
STAR SIGN travelled in mid pack just off the fence, began to close in on the leaders while well in hand with three eighths to run, shifted five wide for the
stretch run gaining momentum and found his best stride late to just get up in time right at the finish to win the bob on the line. PRICELESS WILL broke out
to begin, was content tracking the lone speed on the turn, started to reel in the pacesetter at the quarter marker, poked his nose in front between foes at the
sixteenth pole and lost in a tight photo at the wire. MAAKWA was off slow on the break, was coaxed for position to take command on the rail at the half,
opened up on the field through the turn, was clinging to a narrow lead turning for home, stubbornly battled on the rail to the wire but was on the losing end of
a three horse photo for the win at the finish showing a gritty effort in deep stretch. LENNY K was in tight at the start, co-trailed down the backstretch, began
picking up runners advancing inside with three eighths to go, slipped up the fence to be in range at the top of the lane and put in a good run gaining late at
the wire. KING ALFREDO settled in mid pack three deep down the back straight, made little presence three wide running on the turn and angled out widest
in lane seven for the stretch drive and was one paced to the finish. HIGHLAND LIFE had a good spot early tracking the top three leaders outside, put in a
brief rally four wide outside rivals at the five sixteenth marker, was in the mix in the six path turning for home and levelled off in deep stretch. U S ARMY
CORPS broke in at the start, took the early lead soon after leaving the gate, was relegated to track three wide at the half, midway on the turn was asked for
more, offered little response, was steadied mildly between runners entering the stretch and yielded through the lane. GALLOPING D'ORO co-trailed on the
outside down the backstretch, could not catch up to the field running throughout the turn and was never involved in the stretch run to the wire.

Footnotes
SARAH'S DANCER exchanged some light contact at the start, settled between runners mid-pack, switched out six wide leaving the turn, drove past inside
the final sixteenth. BIJOU BABY stalked from outside, advanced on the leader three then four wide on the turn taking the lead at the top of the stretch, was
headed in upper stretch, dueled with that inside foe, bested that one late but couldn't hold off the winner. ELLA FRANCES settled off the pace, advanced
inside leaving the turn saving ground, bid inside taking a narrow lead in upper stretch, was outfinished but held show. MRS. C exchanged a light bump at
the start, settled off the pace outside, began a rapid advance outside on the turn coming to the top of the stretch six to seven wide, gained steadily through
the stretch but needed more and just missed show honors. WHERE'S SAMNBAILEY settled outside mid-pack, advanced four then five wide on the turn
looming a threat in upper stretch but evened out. TAPPING A RHYTHM tracked inside a rival but well off the leader early, advanced on that on in behind
racing just off the fence, steadied on heels slightly when in tight near the quarter pole, came out further past that juncture, ran on. WORRY LESS shifted in
saving ground on the turn, ran on evenly. KNOTTY AND NICE lacked early speed, ran up on heels coming past the three-quarters and briefly was put to a
hold, continued racing toward the back and was never near enough to threaten. MOONBRIGHT hesitated at the start spotting the field about five lengths,
advanced outside foes into the turn, swung seven wide into the stretch, failed to threaten. ROSES ARE FREE broke sharply and quickly sped clear shifting
in, set the pace racing about in the two path, gave way when headed late on the turn. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF TAPPING A
RHYTHM AGAINST BIJOU BABY ALLEGING INTERFERENCE NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
