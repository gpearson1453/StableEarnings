PAT'S GAL brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way on the inside up the backstretch, drew off racing in the two
path around the turn and in upper stretch and held a dwindling lead to the wire. MIZ MCCOY raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn
in the two path, launched a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. DIXIE GIRL TO raced in the middle of the pack between horses through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly. TAMMY MACHO bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled off
the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and showed no kick. NONA bumped and was forced back by the
horses to both sides leaving the gate, moved up to chase the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
MOLLY'S ANGEL raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn and kicked
clear in the lane. CLUBHOUSE SAINT raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and gained ground late. IT'S HER TIME saved ground around the first turn, led the way up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far bend, was caught in midstretch and kept on to the wire. ELUSIVE AMELIA chased the leader from the two path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, continued around the second turn still in the two path and finished evenly. SEA LEVEL raced in the three path around the first bend,
continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and showed no kick. TOM'S GIRL saved
ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the two path and made no bid. COUNTESS OF CAIRO
trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two and three path throughout and was not a factor.
