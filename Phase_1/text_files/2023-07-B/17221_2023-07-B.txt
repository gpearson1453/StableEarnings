Footnotes
GHOUL (BRZ) was content to sit behind the lone speed at the half, kept a close eye on the pacesetter throughout the turn, had his sights set on the leader
turning for home and wore down that rival late to get up in the last few strides for the win. JIBARO was hustled to have a loose lead setting the pace down
the back straight, continued comfortably uncontested through the turn, had something left in reserve for the stretch drive, battled inside to the finish but gave
way grudgingly in deep stretch holding for the place share. WESTERN TROUBLE travelled two deep outside in mid field with a half left to run, took up the
chase outside five sixteenths to go, closing the gap on the leaders to be in the hunt three wide turning for home and was gaining steadily to the wire but just
ran out of room at the finish. BLUE MAX stalked near the rear in hand on the fence down the backstretch, could not get into gear on the rail losing ground to
runners throughout the turn and showed some late interest inside down the stretch to get up for a minor role in the end. MARTEN RIVER broke out, hit the
gate at the start, was then steadied between runners trying to get position at the nine sixteenths marker to trail down the backside, was hard ridden midway
on the turn just outside, angled five wide around foes at the top of the lane and stalled in the final sixteenth. STRIKING HEIR settled in mid pack on the rail
under a good hold at the half, could not quicken on the fence with outside rivals at the quarter pole and tired inside in the last eighth. RCOF #5 MARTEN

Footnotes
RAGING BEAR broke outwards on the break, recovered to have a narrow lead on the rail at the half mile marker, opened up comfortably in hand on the
turn, was roused at the furlong marker and responded to hold safe at the finish. SERENADE AT SEA was in a good position at the half watching the top two
engage for the lead with four furlongs remaining, rallied three wide to go after the loose winner on the turn, posed the only threat turning for home but could
not gain to the wire to be second best on this day. TREBUCHET was squeezed back at the start to be near the back on the rail in the beginning, split horses
midpoint on the turn when urged for more, was in with a chance in the four path straightening out for the drive and could not pose a threat to the top two to
the wire and was a clear third crossing the line. J M R TUREK was reined back to be near the rear at the half mile marker, commenced a run three wide with
runners on either side three furlongs out picking up runners, shifted five deep to be in the mix at the top of the lane but could only offer an even finish to the
wire settled for a small share in the end. HARPER CITY settled in the middle of the pack all alone on the fence, advanced on the rail three furlongs from the
wire, shifted outside going around a weakening foe and levelled out inside in the final sixteenth. IGNITE THE STORM broke in to begin, stalked near the
rear three deep at the half, made little progress running through the turn, angled four wide for the stretch drive but could not factor to the finish line. GOOD
SKIP INDEED was off slow to begin trailing the field in the early stages of the race, shifted three wide two furlongs out around a tiring runner and could not
get involved driving to the wire. IT'S A SOUPERMOON was bumped at the start, recovered to prompt outside down the backstretch, was asked to keep up
with the front running winner three furlongs from the prize, offered little response, backed away at the quarter marker and galloped to the finish. RCOF #4

Footnotes
WICKED MIAH hopped at the start, tracked four wide into the first turn, pulled the rider outside to the lead entering the back straight, was nudged on for a
little more up top in the final turn and just had enough left in the tank to win by a diminishing margin at the wire. TRISH THE DISH took the field into the first
turn, was headed outside by the winner entering the backstretch, was shuffled back a couple of positions on the rail in the final turn, resurged in upper
stretch and closed strongly to just miss getting up for the win at the finish. TEXT ME UP stalked near the rear three wide into the first turn, tracked in mid
pack three deep at the half mile pole, was urged to keep position three furlongs to home, loomed a threat at the top of the lane outside but needed more late
to threaten for the win in the end. LITTLE FIRE prompted the pace just outside, watched the top two down the backside, was in tight surroundings into the
final turn between runners to be steadied at the three furlong marker, regrouped on the fence turning for home to get up for the minors at the finish. PHIL IN
ECHO settled near the back on the rail into the first turn, offered an early move three deep circling horses with three eighths to run, shifted out four wide for
the drive, could not sustain her run and tailed off in mid stretch. ITS A BIRDIE was nestled on the rail behind the leader in the early going, travelled in
midfield on the rail at the half, was ridden for more three eighths from the line, made little gain and could not make any impact to the wire. IVY'S STAR
trailed the field in the early stages of the race, lost touch with the runners through the far turn and could not reach contention running to the finish line.

Footnotes
BILL NEEDLE settled off the leading pair stalking two to three wide into the first turn, was guided out several further paths heading to and up the backstretch
while advancing rapidly and willingly to take the lead by the nine-sixteenths and pressed by an outside foe, moved back in to about three deep heading into
the far turn and allowed the outside foe to go on with the lead as that one was intent and in front by the three-eighths, was confidently handled easing back
off that one and switched out at the quarter pole, put to urging at the top of the stretch with aim on the leader, took over just outside the furlong marker and
kicked clear. GLENHOLME settled outside off the pace early, moved forward outside and with the winner up the backstretch to press that one, edged to the
lead by the three-eighths and gradually moved clear on the turn shifting in a path or so coming to the quarter pole, was challenged in upper stretch, no
match but second best. ARAMOS settled off the pace racing off the inside mostly two to four wide, swung out seven wide turning for home in behind the
leading trio, battled with a rival and secured show honors while no threat to the top pair. HIGH TREASON unhurriedly brought up the rear racing off the
inside, fanned eight wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly. BLONDE DYNAMO got away well, was under a hold and a bit keen and erratic in the early going
pressing the pace from outside two to three wide, dropped back off the leaders heading to the far turn but racing not too far back and in behind, angled six
wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. ARNIE P exchanged a light bump at the start, raced near the inside toward the back and was never near
enough to threaten. BLASITO set the pace inside facing outside pressure, was overtaken midway up the backstretch, gave way.

Footnotes
MAD DOG N JOE broke sharply and nearly a length on top, sped clear into the first turn shifting in to set the pace, extended the advantage all the way up
the backstretch, put to urging in the stretch, was in search of the wire late and lasted. SPIRIT ANIMAL settled three wide early, advanced some outside a
foe two to three wide on the far turn, came out a path at the top of the stretch still with much to do, gained steadily under strong urging but missed.
LAPOCHKA settled at the rear inside, switched off the rail, began to pick it up two to three wide on the far turn, rallied between runners nearing the sixteenth
pole to secure show honors while no threat to the top pair. STEAK AND CHEESE raced outside off the pace caught three to four wide early, advanced past
foes still racing outside into and on the far turn, ran on evenly in the lane. HALLIE'S HERO was under a hold racing just off the leader saving ground inside
into the first turn, continued along the inside well back of that one up the backstretch but still in second, urged along by the quarter pole but failed to rally.
MALIBU UPROAR settled between runners two to three wide on the first turn, continued off the inside at the rear on the far turn, was not a threat.
ANSELMO was mid-pack early racing just off the rail, dropped back and faded.

TWISTED PATH was on the rail keeping a close eye on the frontrunner down the backstretch, had to tap on the brakes when behind the leader at the
quarter pole, found the rail seam turning for home, burst through to claim the lead at the eighth pole and held for the win drifting out nearing the wire.
MAMBOINTHEFOREST tracked between rivals in the two path into the first turn, was content to sit just outside watching the pacesetter down the back
straight, rallied to be in the hunt three wide at the quarter pole, had a brief lead at the top of the stretch and battled to the finish just missing while not
switching leads through the stretch. BLOCKBUSTER was allowed to settle to be near the rear down the backside, rallied inside midway on the far turn to
catch up to the field, angled out in lane four to have a clear run for the drive and fought on the win the show battle down the stretch. KITTEN'S BOY was
unhurried to trail for the most part of the race, took closer order but still could see the field turning for home widest in the eight path and could not offer a
strong run in the stretch being one paced to the finish. TARADAR was hustled for the lead into the first turn, continued to set the fractions down the
backside, was collared by runners on either side at the top of the lane and tired in the final sixteenth. PAPA'S PLACE tracked three wide throughout the
race, could not make any impression when the running started on the final turn and stopped in the six path in mid stretch.

Footnotes
LUV TO WIN had a slim lead while pressured outside down the backside, dictated the pace on the rail into the turn, began to edge away from the chaser
when coaxed for run in upper stretch and was kept to the task to hold safe at the finish line. MENDELJOHN (IRE) was bounced around between runners on
the break, was asked early so to get a good inside position behind the top two after the poor start, waited to pounce on the fence watching the front pair fight
it out at the quarter pole, angled out in the four path for the drive to the line but could not gain on the winner besting the rest at the finish. MIA AND ME was
in tight quarters at the start, shuffled back to be near the rear down the backstretch, began to lengthen stride on the rail two furlongs from the wire, angled
out while gaining momentum at the eighth pole and was full of run in deep stretch. SMART COVERAGE pressed the winner outside down the back straight,
continued to hound the winner two wide on the turn, was still in the hunt with challengers on either side turning for home but needed more late to threaten
the top two in mid stretch and faded some late still while still holding on for a small share. BOSS HOLIDAY broke outwards to begin, tracked the leaders
three wide outside at the half, made slight gains on the top pair through the turn and offered only an even finish to the wire. GUNGI tracked between runners
in the two path four furlongs from home, was asked for more run on the rail midway on the turn, made little headway inside and could not find more on the
fence to contend down the stretch. CANDY STREET settled all alone in mid pack at the half mile marker, could not close the gap on the leaders through the
turn and lacked a stretch kick to be involved running to the finish line. HALF TO RELOAD broke in hitting the gate to trail down the backside, could not get
involved running on the turn and was not a presence driving to the wire.

Footnotes
SILENT LUCIDITY tracked just outside on the first turn, rated kindly on the rail waiting patently at the half, was nudged on to go after the pacesetter three
furlongs from home, quickly overtook the leader to easily open up in upper stretch and cruised home for the win. SOCIAL JUSTICE stalked near the rear
three deep outside down the backstretch, put in a good turn of foot around runners four wide on the final turn, could not catch the lone gone winner down
the lane but ran on well besting the others getting the runners up share in the end. REINS OF PURPLE was brushed inside at the start to trail in the early
stages of the race, advanced between runners from last at the half mile pole, weaved her way in the two path through traffic on the final turn, angled out five
deep for the drive and closed in the be a clear third at the finish. ROBITAILLE stalked on the rail in the early going, continued inside down the back straight
near the back of the pack, was shuffled to last midway on the turn on the fence behind runners waiting for running room, seam opened up inside at the two
furlong marker, shot on through hugging the rail and showed late energy to get up for a small piece of the prize. GRAND GIZMO had the lead on the the rail
in the first quarter, extended her advantage running down the backstretch, was collared by the winner on the far turn outside at the quarter marker, offered
no resistance and stalled on the fence in the final sixteenth. ETHNIC SOUL angled in two wide saving some ground from the outside post entering the first
turn, was all alone in mid field four furlongs remaining, was asked to keep up with runners three eighths to the finish, could not keep pace with rivals and
came up empty four wide for the drive. ROCKLAND EXPRESS was brushed outside to begin, tracked three wide into the first turn, chased the loose
frontrunner down the back straight, was roused to keep position three eighths remaining but could not keep up and yielded in upper stretch.
