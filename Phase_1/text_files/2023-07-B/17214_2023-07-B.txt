Footnotes
ONE TIME WILLARD stalked close up two wide, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with GROUCH, gained command in upper stretch and kicked
clear under urging. DUQUESNE raced off the pace inside, saved ground while waiting for room on the far turn, angled out at the eighth pole and finished
well. GROUCH set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely on the rail, yielded and held well for third. HERE COMES
BILLY was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and weakened. PAL raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on
the far turn and lacked a rally. COUNTRY MILES was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside, then between rivals and failed to threaten. KRATOS
lunged and was away awkwardly for a very poor start, then was outrun early and did not factor.

Footnotes
SMALL REASON stalked close up two wide, commenced his bid nearing the quarter pole, took over turning for home, drew off under urging and coasted the
final yards. DIZZY GILLESPIE raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the turn, rallied outside in the stretch and was along for the place spot.
MOTION TO STRIKE set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner into the stretch and weakened. CACTUS JACK raced off the pace, inside on the
turn and finished evenly to best the others. SHANGHAI WARRIOR moved off the inside in the early stages, chased on the turn and tired. GOLOVKIN raced
off the rail, off the pace, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PER THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, GOLOVKIN HAS
BEEB DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.
