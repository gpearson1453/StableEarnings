Footnotes
WINDRIBBON stalked four deep, bid five wide outside a pair of rivals leaving the turn and took over entering the stretch, drew clear with a furlong remaining
and held safely under urging. C'MON MAN broke cleanly then dropped back off the pace, went two wide around the turn, moved out in the lane and rallied
to get up for the place. WYFIRE raced up close three deep into the turn, lost contact with the leader on the bend then challenged again between rivals four
wide entering the stretch and got outkicked by the winner in the final furlong. CHASING FAME tracked five wide into the turn, moved into the four path
around the bend, came five wide into the drive and produced a late run for a minor award. SELF TAUGHT unhurried and lagged behind early, saved ground
through the turn, tipped out in the lane and improved position. STRIKE THAT coaxed early and was prominent to the inside of the leader then paused to let
that rival go and switched to the outside, reengaged the pacesetter while between rivals past the half-mile pole, lost touch around the turn, chased three to
four into the lane, weakened and walked into the van off following the race. HANDR'SDREAM brushed with outer rival at the start, went up to take control,
set a pressured pace two wide into the turn, cleared then was challenged again by a pair of rivals late on the bend, fought three wide into the lane, then
weakened in the stretch run. TETSU broke a step slow and brushed at the start, tracked in range into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ECONOMICAL brushed leaving the gate, settled off the pace, closed in three to four wide on the turn, drew alongside the top pair turning for home, took
over in upper stretch and drove clear. JAM SESSION got bumped leaving the gate, went up to set the pace under pressured from outer rival, maintained
command through the turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to save the place. GROUP HUG raced near the back off the inside,
rounded the bend four to five wide, finished willingly down the lane and missed the place. MISSED CALL chased inside a pair of rivals along the rail into the
turn, went two wide into the lane, tipped out upper stretch and flattened out. CHARLIE'S GHOST pressed the pace from outside, stayed alongside to the top
of the stretch, then retreated in the lane. SMILING AT VAL was off slow and shifted in at the start but was quickly corrected, chased off the rail while
climbing a bit, went two wide around the turn and could not rally. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT stumbled and bumped inner rival, chased between then two wide
into the turn, lost ground around the bend, angled four to five wide approaching the stretch and weakened. AURELIAN MAN lost his footing momentarily at
the start, stalked the leaders three deep into the turn, got put in tight and checked entering the stretch and faded after. SPIRITIST lacked early speed, trailed
on the inside into the turn, moved off the rail around the bend and failed to menace.

WARRENS CANDY GIRL broke a step slow, settled inside, went between foes in the middle stages, angled five wide around the far turn, rallied to the front
with a sixteenth to go and drove clear. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE tracked in the two path, moved inside on the backstretch, shifted back to the two path on the
far turn then came three wide into the lane, launched a bid past the eighth pole, drifted out in the furlong grounds to bother rival and got outkicked by the
winner. NEVISIAN SUNRISE settled in the two path, checked three deep between rivals at the five-eighths pole, rounded the far turn three then four wide,
rallied between foes in the lane but got crowded midstretch and stayed on to hold the show. FREEDOM FLYER antsy in the gate, stalked three wide early,
traveled three deep into the far turn, bid two wide into the stretch, fought between rivals into deep stretch and got outfinished. SYMPHONY PERFECT (IRE)
tucked inside at the back, tipped two to three wide on the far turn, roused at the top of the stretch, moved out and rallied between foes late. LUCKY GIRL
(IRE) traveled two wide near the back in the beginning, three deep at the quarter pole, launched a rally but lacked room and checked in midstretch, angled
to the inside and finished willingly. CANOODLING dueled for the lead from outside then pulled three wide and ceded command on the clubhouse turn,
moved to apply pressure in the middle stages, took over exiting the backstretch and cleared with three furlongs left to run, angled over to the inside around
the far turn, met outside challenger entering the stretch, resisted until relinquishing the lead approaching the sixteenth pole and flattened late.
ASCENDANCY unhurried in the two path, traveled outside rivals up the backstretch, went three wide into the far turn, drifted out at the five-sixteenths pole,
spun five wide into the lane and needed to find more in the final furlong. UNA CHIQUITITA (CHI) raced on the inside towards the rear early, got blocked
behind rivals near the quarter pole, tipped out into the clear and put to right handed urging but failed to threaten. OVER ATTRACTED was off a bit slow,
unhurried three deep, raced four then three deep in the middle stages, got floated out on the far turn, came wide into the stretch and lacked a rally. VERY
SCARY tracked along the inside out of range, steadied between foes nearing the half-mile pole, continued between into the far turn, angled to the inside and
came up empty. ANTHONYS CLEOPATRA sat off the pace three deep, four deep early on the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and failed to
threaten. HONEY PANTS steered to the inside traveling in mid-pack, tipped two wide at the quarter pole and proved no menace. LADYWEARSTHERING
dueled early from inside then cleared, pressured from outside in the middle stages, lost command with three furlongs remaining, dropped back on the far

Footnotes
ANISETTE (GB) unhurried in the beginning and moved into the two path, took closer order between rivals in the middle stages, angled five wide into the
stretch, bid four deep in upper stretch and quickly took over at the eighth pole, put away inner rivals and won going away. OCEAN CLUB tracked outside a
rival in the two path then between foes, chased two wide into the drive, bid between rivals in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. AND TELL ME
NOLIES settled between foes, raced outside a rival into the far turn, had to pause behind a foe entering the stretch, finished determinedly and outkicked
THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) for the show honors. THE WILD GRAZER (IRE) settled three wide outside a rival early, traveled four deep up the backstretch,
exited the far turn six wide, finished well in the lane but got outfinished for third. DELIGHT traveled along the inside near the back early, went between foes
into the far turn, got boxed in briefly early on that bend, chased three wide into the lane, kept on in the final furlong but needed to find more. OLIVIA TWIST
tracked three deep early, closed in and challenged four deep with a quarter mile left to run, fought three deep into the final furlong but flattened in the late
stages. FLYING CONNECTION got crowded along the rail early, ran up on heels leaving the first turn, raced near the back on the inside into the far turn,
chased two wide into the lane and could not threaten. WED (FR) was off slow to begin, tucked inside on the first turn, ridden along the far turn continuing to
save ground, tipped out into the stretch, put to left handed urging and improved position. PARIS SECRET (IRE) sat off the pace along the two path, checked
between three deep early on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. ANCIENT PEACE dueled for command from inside
while pulling, ceded command when the rider took hold on the first turn, tugged forward again to engage the leader from outside, dueled on the far turn and
took over at the quarter pole, lost command with a furlong left to run and retreated. COMANCHE COUNTRY (IRE) traveled two wide near the back in the
early going, came four wide into the lane and failed to menace. SPICYBUG tracked from inside, tipped out at the top of the stretch and had little left for the
drive. BROADWAY GIRLS broke well then took a stalking position while angling inward, raced outside rivals in the middle stages, bid three deep on the far
turn and tired down the lane. FAST AND SHINY dueled for command from outside then cleared around the clubhouse turn and crossed over to the inside,
reengaged by ANCIENT PEACE up the backstretch, fought with that rival around the far turn and lost command at the quarter pole, checked at the eighth
pole and gave way.

Footnotes
MICI'S EXPRESS chased off the rail, steadied near the seven-sixteenths pole, steadied again at the three-eighths pole, angled three to four wide on the
turn, rallied and drew alongside the top pair with a sixteenth and surged ahead in a game victory. PETESOLDFASHIONED vied three deep then between
rivals, kept the pressure on from outside on the turn before taking over and showed the way two wide into the stretch, clung to a slim lead a furlong
remaining, was overtaken shortly after but stayed on well through deep stretch for a hard fought second. DR. NO NO broke a step slow, raced up close five
then four deep up the backstretch, vied three deep into the lane, took over past the eighth pole but faltered late to get passed by the top pair. CAPO LUIGI
showed brief speed between rivals then chased leaving the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, tipped out in the lane and finished evenly.
CHROMEFLASH hit the gate then bumped inner rival, lacked room at the five-sixteenths pole then split foes on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
flattened out. POTITO broke a step slow then went up to vie for command from inside, inched ahead on the turn then gave up command into the stretch and
weakened. BURAQ'S REFLECTION stumbled then got bumped from outside, came three wide into the stretch and was not a factor. DONNIE THE CHIRO
tossed his head at the start, chased out of range off the inside, traveled five deep at the quarter pole and weakened. IMMELMANN vied four then three deep
early, started to weaken and got shuffled between past the quarter pole, angled in and came two wide into the stretch and tired. I WILL BE KING threw his
head at the start, was hard to ride early, came four wide into the drive and never got involved.

Footnotes
SARWAR (FR) traveled in mid-pack on the inside, moved off the fence up the backstretch, came three to four wide into the lane, swept by at the eighth pole
and held well. LOTTERY PICK hit the gate then got crowded at the start, raced on the inside near the back, went between foes in the middle stages, lacked
room around the far turn, angled out in the lane, closed well and got up for second. TIO MAGICO settled in the two path, remained off the rail through the far
turn, tipped out in the drive, finished willingly but got edged by LOTTERY PICK for the place honors. BAJ stalked three deep around the first turn, two three
wide on the second bend, chased within striking distance through the final furlong but could not summon the needed late kick. DOMINANT SOUL was
closest in pursuit in the two path to the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch and could not find the needed response when called upon. VANCOUGAR
sat off the pace and angled in, went between rivals into the far turn then angled to the rail, chased two wide into the lane, looked to commence a rally but
found traffic behind the rivals, angled to the inside in the stretch and could not rally. CANE CREEK ROAD sped clear and set all the pace to the stretch,
offered no resistance to the winner at the eighth pole and weakened after. LIBERAL (IRE) trailed in the early stages, raced four deep on the backstretch,
spun five wide into the lane and improved position. HALFBARBERBINGIE stalked two wide between rivals early, raced along the rail on the far turn and
tired. MISCHELOF (CHI) chased towards the rear on the inside early, got blocked at the five-sixteenths pole and failed to menace. FINNEUS broke a bit
slow and got crowded, raced outside a rival near the back early, three deep at the midway point, steadied at the three-eighths pole and failed to make an
impact. MUHAMMAD ALI (PER) brushed inner rival at the start, stalked the pace from inside, dropped back into and around the far turn and was done early.
