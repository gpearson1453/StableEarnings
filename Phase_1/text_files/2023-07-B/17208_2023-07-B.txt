Footnotes
OUR GIRL ASHLEY broke out to bump ZEVA DEE, then steadied in tight between horses nearing the five-eights pole, swung out to move forward on the
turn while racing four-wide, continued wide into the stretch and was up in the final sixteenth. SENSUOUS KITTY prompted the pace while racing two-wide,
took the lead from ZEVA DEE inside the eighth pole but was unable to hold off the winner. ZEVA DEE was bumped at the start by OUR GIRL ASHLEY,
then saved ground setting the pace into the stretch and tired late. LUTE'S DIAMOND was allowed to settle while racing two-wide but lacked a rally. DEBBI'S
TALON was prominent early while racing three-wide and tired. HASTA LUEGO saved ground chasing the pace for a half mile and gave way. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT AFTER VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

GOLD RUSH JUNIOR prompted the issue while racing four-wide on the turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, opened clear nearing the eighth pole
and maintained a safe advantage. THE THIRD RING vied for the lead from along inside, dropped back slightly on the turn, then responded during the drive
and came again to earn the place in a game try. GYPSY GUN was forwardly placed while racing six-wide on the turn, angled in during the drive to offer a
bid nearing the eighth pole and flattened out late. HOLLYWOOD AS USUAL vied for the early lead from along the inside, was shuffled back nearing the half
mile pole in tight along the inside, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch, was in tight briefly nearing the three-sixteenths pole and then finished
willingly when clear. AGRIGENTO dueled for the lead to the stretch from between horse while two-wide and weakened. TIME 'N TIME AGAIN was

DISTINCTIVE DEB vied with SANDY HARBOR for the early lead, dropped back slightly nearing the stretch, angled to the inside nearing the eighth pole and
came again with a late rush to be up in the final strides. SANDY HARBOR saved ground setting the pressured pace, drifted out slightly leaving the
three-sixteenths pole and just failed to last in a game effort. SECRET HOTTIE saved ground stalking the pace, angled out to be two-wide entering the
stretch to offer his bid but lacked the needed late response. EVA MAXINE was off a step slow, then dropped back, came four-wide into the stretch and was
gaining late. RAVEN'S QUEST was prominently placed while racing three-wide on the turn, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly late.
SPARKLES AND SPURS broke out, then raced two-wide and failed to threaten. POCKET KNIFE saved ground while being unhurried and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISO FAST dropped back early while saving ground, came two-wide into the stretch, split rivals during drive and was up with a rush in the final sixteenth to
win going away. ASIAN RAIN set the pressured pace while two-wide, angled in during the drive opening a clear lead nearing the eighth pole but wasn't quite
good enough in a game try. IRON ROB was unhurried early, came four-wide into the stretch and finished fast. CODE CHARLIE was bumped at the start bu
ZACCHEUS, then was forwardly placed while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter pole and then faltered during the drive.
ZACCHEUS broke out to bump CODE CHARLIE, then prompted the pace from along the inside to near the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
QUEENSBORO saved ground while being allowed to settle, rallied three-wide into the stretch, took the lead leaving the eighth pole and edged clear late.
SHE SAID MY WAY was unhurried early, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished full of run to end up in a dead-heat with OLIVIA'S CHOICE for
second. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) saved ground while being reserved off the pace, slipped through entering the stretch, then steadied nearing the eighth
pole when GOAT ROCKS came in and finished willingly when clear to end up on even terms with SHE SAID MY WAY for second. GOAT ROCKS saved
ground setting the pace, drifted out nearing the quarter pole, then came in nearing the eighth pole to take the path of OLIVIA'S CHOICE and weakened.
PRINCESS PAYTON was allowed to settle, came five-wide into the stretch but lacked a rally. GET MY POINT prompted the pace while racing two-wide and
tired. LASSIE CAT was forwardly placed for three furlongs and gave way.
