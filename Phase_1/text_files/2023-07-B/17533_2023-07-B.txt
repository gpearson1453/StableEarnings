GRAYDAWN DAY sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace with rivals not far behind, continued to hold off pursuers around the turn, saved
ground entering the lane, roused for more, responded willingly, tapped once in the final furlong and drew off under a strong hand ride. BREW CASA raced in
contention up the backstretch, launched a bid in the three path at the quarter pole, was no match for pulling away winner but sustained bid and finished
second best. CLAY'S OPAL INDY raced off the top trio in the opening quarter, chased three to four paths wide around the turn, angled in to race two wide a
furlong out and gained show. GP'S AMAZING GRACE rated off the top trio along the inside, came out a path wider and chased around the turn, ran on two
wide into the lane and failed to kick on. HENNY'S CHICK was off slow at the start, raced in the back, came three to four wide into the lane and failed to rally.
POWER TO PLAY prompted the pace up the backstretch, chased up close around the turn then tired in the drive.

LONG MONDAY quickly cleared from the outside and angled in entering the first turn, set a pressured pace up the backstretch with SHES A BIG STAR
running close behind, widened advantage still unleashed around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, had plenty left in reserve, tapped a couple
times in the final furlong then finished ridden out to an easy score. SHE'S A BIG STAR was forwardly placed around the first turn and applied pace pressure
to LONG MONDAY up the backstretch, came under a drive midway around the far turn, was no match for pulling away winner but stayed on and finished
clearly second best. REINA DEL SUR raced two wide around the first turn then remained unhurried and settled in the back, swung three wide into the lane
and gathered a share. SOCIAL CIRCLE raced three paths wide around the first turn, stalked the top two leaders up the backstretch, flattened around the far
turn, came three wide into the lane and was no late threat. YANKEE PRIDE steadied around the first turn, raced in range up the backstretch, chased the top
pair along the inside around the far turn then tired in the drive.

WON HAPPY MAMA got carried in at the start then quickly moved up to take over the early lead, set the pace and held firm over pursuers around the turn,
saved ground entering the lane, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under steady encouragement. ESPRIT ROUGE raced in contention and
hustled up along the rail on the turn, sustained inside bid into the stretch run, dueled for second best and outdueled rival in final stride.
MORNINGNOONANDNITE was forwardly placed in opening stages, sustained a two wide around the turn and into the lane, battled outside of ESPIRIT
ROUGE for second best and got nipped for position in final stride. C'MON LUCKY broke in at the start and raced off the early pace, swung four wide into the
lane and edged closer in deep stretch. TOMMY'S CRUE angled in and saved ground around the turn, came under left handed urging and angled out two to
three wide in upper stretch, ran along in the mix for a share but needed more. TENNESSEE GRACE was off slow at the start, trailed racing wide, came two
to three wide into the lane and never menaced. SHE'S SOLID SILVER was not too far back in opening stages, was ridden up into close contention three
wide mid-way around the turn then failed to keep pace and retreated in the lane.

RUN FIRE RUN dueled outside of a trio in early stages, took on the challenge of ORE MIND near the quarter pole, held a slim lead in upper stretch then
found more in reserve and pulled away in the final furlong. ORE MINE rated through opening stages then circled up four wide to challenge RUN FIRE RUN
for the lead at the quarter pole, raced in aim in upper stretch then failed to be a match in the final furlong and settled for clearly second best. WINDY O K C
dueled for the early lead along the inside, fought back into upper stretch then gave way in the final furlong. DEFIANT MALICE was off a step slow at the
start and raced off the pace, edged closer along the rail around the turn, tipped two to three wide for the drive and needed more for late impact. BORDINOS
vied three wide in opening stages, fought back to the midway point on the turn then weakened. ADAIR COUNTY raced off the early pace, swung five wide
into the lane and never threatened. BIYOMBO vied two wide in opening stages, battled around the turn then tired in the drive. EVEN TERMS failed to move
into contention. WAR HAWK raced two wide not too far back early on, had no response when called upon on the turn and steadily retreated.

PRESENT TIME vied inside in opening stages then held a slim lead on top past the half mile marker, held onto the narrow margin around the turn, came
two wide into the lane, widened to a clear advantage a furlong out and finished ridden out under a confident handling. HALOSNHEAVEN was rated near
midpack in the early going then circled up three to four wide to challenge PRESENT TIME for the lead, continued to chase after rival through the lane and
finished clearly second best. COLLECTED GLORY raced up close three wide into turn, sustained bid into upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong.
SHEMEANSBIZNESS was forwardly placed racing two wide in early stages, continued up close around the turn then faded in the lane. MINNIE'S READY
rated just off the early leaders, edged closer along the rail around the turn then failed to sustain bid into the lane. MUCHO MIA raced in the back and saved
ground to no avail. ARRESTED raced in range up the backstretch, flattened entering the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

Footnotes
APRETTYLULABY was well placed tracking the top pair two to three paths wide up the backstretch, angled to the rail entering the turn and edged a bit
closer, tipped out two wide at the head of the lane and headed in pursuit, dug in determinedly under left handed pressure and kicked clear in deep stretch.
IVY ABAD GIRL sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held firm over pursuers around the turn and saved ground
entering the lane, held clear past the furlong marker then got wore down in deep stretch. BIT A BAD NEWS raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo
two wide around the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, steadily edged closer and captured show. KID BIZ rated near midpack up the backstretch,
moved up closer three to four wide near the quarter pole, came five paths wide into the lane, continued in range and lacked the needed kick for serious
impact. REBA saved ground racing midpack up the backstretch, urged two wide near the quarter pole, continued in range three wide into the final furlong
then finished evenly. AMERICAN SUE tracked the top trio up the backstretch, chased between foes midway around the turn, came four paths wide into the
lane and gave way. CATALE was forwardly placed through early stages, remained up close around the turn then faded in the lane. REDNECKER stumbled
at the start, raced in the back and had no response.
