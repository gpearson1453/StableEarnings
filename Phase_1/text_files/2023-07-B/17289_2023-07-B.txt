Footnotes
GREER CROSSING broke inward, was checked solidly, quickly recovered to share the lead from outside, angled in beside MADELYN ATTACK nearing the
quarter pole, was roused leaving the bend, edged ahead with a sixteenth left and began to draw off in the waning yards. MADELYN ATTACK vied for the
lead from inside rivals, floated out some when roused leaving the turn, battled gamely but did not have enough left the last sixteenth. ENVEY N ICE settled
early, picked up her pace after a quarter mile, threatened along the rail with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. DESTINY'S DREAM contested the pace
between rivals for three and a half furlongs then steadily yielded.

Footnotes
GEORGE'S VISION broke a bit outward, was rated off the early speed from outside, commenced his bid after a half mile, was three wide on the second
bend, carried out some into the lane, was all out outside SAFE and narrowly prevailed. SAFE stalked the leader from between rivals, made his bid two wide
on the second turn, drifted out some entering the stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. DUCKDEVIL was quickly clear and moved to the
inside, showed the way in hand, was challenged from outside on the second bend, gradually wore down the last two furlongs but stayed well clear for third.
BRASKA was sent to help prompt the early pace from just off the inside, swung to the outside nearing the quarter pole, came into the stretch widest, had to
late bid and was drifting out under left-handed pressure inside the final furlong. OKLAHOMA HEAT showed little in a ground-saving trip.

Footnotes
TOWN CRIER pinched briefly a few strides from the gate, quickly recovered to dispute the pace, moved clear nearing the end of a quarter mile, lengthened
command when allowed on the bend and proved much the best ridden out in the lane. ONE ACE lugged in a bit to bump TOWN CRIER just after the start,
was prominent between rivals, did not keep up three wide on the turn but rallied the last eighth and got up for second late. SPAN was settled just off the
inside on the backstretch, angled out four wide on the bend, showed a willingness to run late and caught UNCLE O. G. for third in the waning yards. UNCLE
O. G. pressed the pace from between horses early, moved clear for second and stayed just off the rail on the turn, was no match for TOWN CRIER when
sent down for the drive and gradually wore down deep stretch. WAVE THE GOLD bumped by TOWN CRIER shortly after the break, was sent to be an early
factor from inside, advanced on the bend but could not sustain his bid in the lane. LELAND JOHN was sent to prompt the pace from outside but began to
fade widest on the turn.

STAY STRONG bumped with THACKER FROMM at the break, stalked the early speed from between rivals, took the advantage three wide when asked
with two furlongs to go, quickly moved clear and steadily opened up while kept to task in the lane. WINDIGO SPIRIT was sent to help prompt the pace just
outside STAY STRONG, came three wide into the stretch, moved clear for second then could only just hold his position late. THACKER FROMM bumped
with STAY STRONG at the start, was settled at the back and inside, picked up his pace on the bend, took over third nearing the final sixteenth and also held
onto his position in the waning yards. HE'S A FINE MAN pressed the pace from just off the rail on the backstretch, did not keep up on the turn, came into
the lane behind WINDIGO SPIRIT, moved outside that one upper stretch and made up minor ground on WINDIGO SPIRIT the final sixteenth. MAGNA
PUNCH quickly clear of the others, was overtaken from outside nearing the end of a half mile, came off the rail some upper stretch, drifted out behind
WINDIGO SPIRIT with a furlong left, was steadied, moved back toward the inside and continued to gradually yield. AWINBENEATHMYWINGS showed little
in a wide trip.

Footnotes
BEIRUT BEAUTY bumped at the break, was rated between rivals, moved clear when let out three wide on the bend, steadily widened command in the lane
and proved much the best ridden out. TEMPLUNA in contention early, angled out to advance on the turn, came into the lane from path five, was no match
for BEIRUT BEAUTY but drew away from the rest for the place. SWEET JUSTICE broke inward, bumping BEIRUT BEAUTY, vied for the lead from inside,
did not stay with the latter on the bend, came off the rail some entering the stretch and began to flatten out. SUPERTRIX stayed widest of all and failed to
have a significant stretch bid. BOBBIE TOO TOO broke alertly, was soon challenged from both sides and began to fade two wide before finishing a half
mile.

Footnotes
GHAALEB'S RANGER urged to stay close early, was two then three wide taking the bend, engaged CANTOO inside the final furlong, edged ahead with a
sixteenth left and kept CANTOO at bay. CANTOO prominent toward the outside, lost ground four then five wide through the turn, took the lead upper
stretch, was challenged inside the last eighth, fought gamely, lacked the needed late kick but was easily second best. JULYNNE moved to the inside after a
quarter mile, had the rail through the bend, took over third inside the final eighth then could only hold her position late. DRAGONFLY KISSES kept close
between rivals, came four wide into the stretch and failed to have a significant response. PRIMITY took the lead from inside after travelling a furlong, set a
pressure pace, floated out some entering the stretch, was no match for the top pair and slowly wore down between horses inside the last furlong.

Footnotes
TIZRIK soon had a clear lead and moved to the inside, was challenged with five furlongs to go, roused nearing the end of a half mile, shook free upper
stretch, was challenged nearing the final sixteenth, dug in and held on. SIRCORRI pressed the early leader from between horses, came into the lane from
path four, steadily closed the gap on the leader and got up in time to share the win with TIZRIK. DEVIL'S RULE hesitated at the break, progressed from
outside, lost ground four then five wide through the bend, took over third nearing the last sixteenth and found best stride too late in the waning yards.
CHERNYAHOVSKIY broke well but was settled back and well off the inside, lost considerable ground widest through the turn, lost further time angling out to
the middle of the track upper stretch, made a strong move the last eighth but came up short. SCARLET CITY engaged TIZRIK from outside after travelling a
furlong, floated out some entering the lane, gradually yielded from between rivals and lugged in with seventy yards left. WILLOW RIDGE prominent from
inside, began to gradually yield nearing the end of a half mile. FAIRWAY LANE raced in contention just outside WILLOW RIDGE on the backstretch, did not
keep up two wide on the bend, lacked a stretch rally, was steadied behind SCARLET CITY in the late going and altered out. TALE OF THE NILE also
hesitated at the start, chased while toward the outside, was three wide on the turn, lost ground fanning outside DEVIL'S RULE into the lane and failed to
have a late bid.
