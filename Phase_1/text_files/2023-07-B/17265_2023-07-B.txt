Footnotes
SHARPZAN settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, began to creep closer in the run to the final turn, launched his
bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, angled three wide into the stretch, and closed willingly while being carried five wide in deep stretch to get up in
time. BACK SHACK away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backside and into the final turn, and fought on gamely through the lane while drifting three wide to just miss. MAJESTIC STREET away alertly and dueled
for the lead from the outside of BACK SHACK in the run down the backside and into the final turn, held a narrow advantage into the lane, and just failed to
last while finishing four wide from between rivals. COUNTERACT bobbled slightly at the start, but recovered quickly and tracked the leaders in the run down
the backstretch, struggled to keep tabs on the pacesetters through the final turn, but finished with late interest two wide in the drive. ROAD CLOSURE
settled at the back of the pack while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but faded over the final
furlong.

Footnotes
BAK TO LIBERTY away well and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, controlled the pace from just off the rail through the
second turn and into the stretch, battled through the final turn from the inside of AZOV SEA, shook clear of that rival entering the lane, and quickly drew
clear under confident handling. AZOV SEA broke sharply and pressed the pace into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, held a
tracking trip two wide entering the backside, battled for the lead two wide into the final turn, was unable to match strides with the winner entering the lane,
but closed three wide in the drive to prove clearly second best. CRYPTO MUNNY tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while racing one out
from the rail, held a stalking trip in the run down the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive while
unable to mount a serious late bid. JOCK TALK was unprepared at the start, and hopped at the start while hitting the side of the gate, trailed well behind the
field and was never a factor. ONE FIFTY ONE away alertly and tracked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail,
maintained his position into the backstretch while continuing to save ground, moved up along the inside of BAK TO LIBERTY midway down the backstretch,
took up when in tight quarters and clipped heels and unseated his rider. ONE FIFTY ONE was vanned off following the race. Following the running of this
race there was a stewards inquiry into both the start, and the incident on the backstretch. After review the stewards deemed that all horses received a fair
start, but in regards to the incident on the backstretch the stewards disqualified BAK TO LIBERTY for causing interference to ONE FIFTY ONE, causing that
rival to clip heels and fall. BAK TO LIBERTY was unplaced as the horse he was deemed to have interfered with did not finish.

Footnotes
SET TO SHINE settled at the back of a compact field while maintaining a stalking trip into the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn,
looped the field leaving the turn, and was up in time while finishing four wide in the drive. JUST JIMMY away alertly and raced to a narrow advantage from
along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of BE QUICK in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, maintained
a slim lead into the lane, and gave way grudgingly late in a game effort. BE QUICK broke sharply and tracked the leader into the first turn while racing one
out from the rail, forced the issue two wide in the run down the backstretch and through the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to
garner a share. INFINITE PATIENCE away well, but took off the early pace to tracked the leaders into the first turn while saving ground at the rail, raced
under snug restraint at the rail in the run down the backside while awaiting room at the rail, continued from along the rail through the final turn while full of
run, but never found a clear path in the lane, following an unlucky trip. SMART LAD tracked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while racing two out
from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but faded over the final furlong.

Footnotes
BOLD ARCH broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear lead in the run down the backside, maintained his
advantage into the final turn, and was never threatened while proving much the best. SIR BREGOVIC away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch
while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and continued on gamely one out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. I'M
CORFU settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished
willingly three wide in the drive to garner a share. AQUITANIA ARRIVAL away alertly and stalked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the
rail, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid in the drive while finishing at the rail. FOREIGN PROTOCOL
unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished four wide in the drive while unable to
seriously threaten. ANARCHY settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final
turn, but faded over the final furlong. Following the running of this race there was rider's claim of foul. The rider of SIR BREGOVIC lodged a claim of foul
against the rider of BOLD ARCH for alleged interference entering the first turn. After review the claim of foul was disallowed, and no change was made to
the original order of finish.

REMEMBERTHEALAMO away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the
final turn, assumed command entering the lane, and held THREE DAY BENDER safely at bay to prevail. THREE DAY BENDER broke sharply and raced to
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, opened a clear advantage in the run to the final turn, was quickly overtaken entering the lane, but finished
gamely from along the rail in the drive to prove clearly second best. JERSEYS IMAGE settled well off the early pace while saving ground at the rail entering
the backstretch, commenced his bid three wide entering the final turn, and finished two out from the rail in the drive to garner a share. SELF SERVING
unhurried early while trailing the field into the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the rail entering he final turn, but needed more when called upon.
ATOMIC HAZE away well, and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide into the backstretch, was called upon soon after entering eh
backstretch to keep up, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three wide in the drive. SETTEBELLO tracked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied one out from the rail entering the final turn, but weakened in the late stages.
