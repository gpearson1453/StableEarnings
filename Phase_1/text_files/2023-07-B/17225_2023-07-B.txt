late. SWEET ANALYZER raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and
finished evenly, no match for the top two. ANGEL OF ATTACK bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, trailed the field early, saved ground
around the turn and improved position mildly in the stretch while never truly threatening. B L'S CONCERTO veered out leaving the gate, recovered to stalk
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the bend in the three path and faded from there. PRESTIGIOUSLY WILD bumped with the horse
to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and was empty in the stretch.

off in the lane, much the best. GRUNDER raced into traffic and steadied while saving ground around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the
run up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the two path and gained ground late. BIG PETE tracked the pace setter on the outside through
the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the three path and kept on to the wire. PASSTHECAT raced in the two path around the first bend,
continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path and passed tiring horses in the lane. TALE OF TRUTH
raced in the two path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn still in the two path and faded in the stretch. THE
SWAYZE EXPRESS raced in the middle of the pack in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the second turn in the
three path and was empty from there. NACHO S raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the
far bend and was never a factor. UNIQUE PATH saved ground around the first turn, stalked the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back
from the rail coming around the second turn and continued to tire in the lane. THE RIDER OF HORSE, GRUNDER, ONE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST
HORSE SEVEN, DONT BOX ME IN, CITING INTERFERENCE HEADED INTO THE FIRST TURN. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
SIR STERLING brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the
way from the two path around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and held that margin to the wire while drifting mildly late. ROSES BY LIAM tracked the
leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and chased on to the finish. IT'S BOBS BUSINESS bumped with
the horse to his inside at the start, raced off the pace early, began to move up coming around the turn, swung out to the five path coming into the stretch and
improved position from there. DISTORTED PRO chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and was
outkicked in the stretch. WEST ISLAND tracked the pace setter between horses through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and
weakened in the lane. CROCODILEHUNTER stalked the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and tired
in the lane.
