Footnotes
COME WHAT MAE settled early along the inside, moved closer while still saving ground to be closest to the leader through the second turn, moved out, bid
nearing the furlong grounds, wore down that rival under firm handling to prove best. RIPTIDE ROSE broke on top, clear past the wire the first time, rated
through some moderate fractions, continued to hold a daylight advantage into the lane, responded when the winner challenged a furlong out, gave ground
grudgingly to that rival while holding sway for the place. TOLATETOOWAIT moved up to race in the second fight, dropped inside, saved ground second
turn, closed the gap on the top two late. GEAUX VOTE lacked early foot while inside, continued to race the rail into the far turn, came three wide for the
drive, steered out wider around some traffic kn midstretch and improved position. CAT B CAUSE chased the runner up for five furlongs, gradually
weakened. STAR FASHION broke back, continued devoid of speed, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. AUNT JANA last away,
moved up to race in midpack, lacked a closing response through the lane. LUCKY HARBORAGE was finished early. OVERLY SWEET fell back to trail after
the start, was always outrun.

Footnotes
FRIEND'S DO CARE with pace from the start while between foes early, continued to vie while closest to the inside turn, shook, clear turning for home,
extended that advantage past the furlong marker then coasted home unthreatened. IRON N STEEL forwardly placed early inside, in tight, shuffled and
steadied to fall back before a quarter, three wide into the lane, rallied to be well clear for the place, failed to threaten the winner. ALL COUNTRY with the
early pace inside, fell back before a quarter, evenly through the turn, along for the show late while not a threat to the top two. WINE MY PRIORITY set or
forced the pace for over three furlongs while widest of the first flight then weakened when the real running began at the head of the lane. HALF CRAZY went
one paced throughout in lacking a closing kick. ALWAYS LEAVING bumped at the start, was used to move up and contest the pace between horses for
three furlongs and began to weaken. POP POP MIKE broke out, bumped, off slowly, trailed throughout and never menaced.

Footnotes
TEASE ME NOT off a step slow, split foes when advancing turning for home, continued rally three wide, going away at the end. JUMPIN JUDY broke on
top, dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed to be clear past the furlong marker, offered little resistance to the winner late while drifing out
to prove no match, all out to preserve the place. HIDDEN LOVE away in good order, dueled up front for a half inside, fell back off the runner up midstretch
then was coming back on that one late for the second spot. SASSY SPRY in the second flight while racing toward the inside, went evenly through the lane
in lacking a closing punch. BANK ON IT in the second group while outside, came four wide and outside the winner exiting the turn, had little left for the run to
the wire. DAT DARES RIGHT well off the pace while saving ground through the turn, lacked a closing response. EXPECT A DANCER remained back in
failing to menace. ABBY DABBY trailed to be always outrun.

Footnotes
SUMMER LIGHTNING broke on top, pressed the issue up the backstretch off the inside, took over turn, carried ZYDECO MUSIC out to the five path turning
for home, refused to yield to that one through the lane, enough left in the final strides to withstand the runner up. MY FRIEND AMY broke back, void of
speed, continued to lag turn just off the inside, split foes nearing the furlong marker when beginning to rally, finished best of all to miss while on the outside
of the first flight at the wire. ZYDECO MUSIC last away,moved closer into the turn, continued to advance and challenged outside the winner by late in the
bend, floated out by that one into the five path into the lane, raced on equal terms with that one past the furlong marker, outkicked by that one late while
being nipped for the second spot at the wire between the top two. SWEET VIDALIA back off the pace while outside, also was five wide out of the turn,
lacked a serious closing response while improving position slightly. ROSE PALACE in the second group while racing toward the inside, asked along midway
on the turn, failed to muster a rally. FIRED UP TIGER back off the pace and the inside, also lacked a response through the lane. BROKE FINANCING
narrowly set the early pace inside, gave way late in the turn. JERSEY HOTTIE fell back to trail after the start and was not a factor. FOLLOWING A CLAIM
OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF ZYDECO MUSIC AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE EXITING THE TURN, THE RESULT WAS
ALLOWED TO STAND.

OVERTAXED outrun in the early going outside, began to move early in the turn, came five wide into the stretch when rallying, challenged a furlong out and
drove strongly clear. THE FIVE B'S chased the early leader off the inside, continued to pursue into the lane, proved no match for the winner late while
overtaking the pacesetter for the runner up spot. KAHAAL cleared early, set a lively pace toward the inside, continued to hold the advantage into the stretch,
weakened. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE within striking distance off the inside, came three wide into the lane, came up empty for the drive to the wire. BRYKEN
N MITCHELL crowded back at the start, trailed early, improved position off the inside without posing a serious threat. BYATHREAD in mid pack up the
backstretch inside, shuffled back a bit while continuing along the inside through the turn, also bettered himself through the lane while non threatening. RUSH
THE COLORS back off the early pace, moved a bit closer off the inside early in the turn then flattened out. CLASSIC RED RACER in tight at the start, failed
to menace. VEGAS GUY remained always back. FUNNY ACTOR in the second flight early, began a steady retreat before three furlongs.

Footnotes
APRIL MIST off the early pace well out in the course, came four wide and between foes into the straight, long drive to the wire, proved best while once again
between rivals at the wire. HOW BOUT ME broke back, lacked speed for three furlongs off the inside, rallied through traffic and was also determined late to
gain the nod for the place. MARIAH'S CANDY in mid pack while widest outside the winner, came with that one into the stretch in the five path, unable to
match that same rival late, narrowly missed the place. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT dueled early along the inside through some lively fractions,shook clear a
furlong out, ,caved in late. ZERO POINT ZERO broke forwardly, shuffled back a bit the opening furlong, chased the leader upper stretch, came up empty
late. RUMPUS pressured the leader from the two path for three furlongs and began to weaken. DOWNTOWN ABBY remained back in lacking a rally.
GYPSYROSELEE steadied soon after the start in some traffic, faded down the stretch. RAISE THE PRAISE last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MUFFIN NUTS prompted the soft pace from the two path, engaged the leader and dueled into the far turn, shook clear when straightened for home,
maintained a daylight advantage to the wire under steady handling. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer from
between horses second turn, three wide into the lane, slowly getting to the winner late. PAYDAY TOO void of speed behind the soft pace, continued to late
second turn,split foes when beginning to advance in upper stretch and finished a mild rally to annex the show. HELLUVA LIFE void of speed, five wide into
the stretch when improving a bit, flattened out the final furlong. CORVETTE SPIRIT broke on top, hustled clear into the first turn, set a soft pace along the
rail, dueled far turn inside the winner, backed up through the stretch. IBERVILLE last to leave, raced back off the pace and off the inside, four wide into the
stretch, failed to muster a rally. OUTLAW X. forwardly placed for six furlongs in the three path, gave way. HONOR MY SPEED had nothing for the drive.
PER RULING DATED09/28/2023 RECEIVED FROM THE LOUISIANA STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #25080), MUFFIN NUTS WAS DQ'D FOR
A POSITIVE TEST.

TSURIS broke back, trailed in lacking any early speed for five furlongs, five wide exiting the final, turn, improved position by passing mostly tiring rivals. THE
BOSS SOSS forwardly placed off the inside, advanced and vied between horses second turn, weakened in the drive. BIG BOSS MAN within striking
distance, also made a bid while between horses through the second bend, faltered in the drive. ROCK ON COWBOY took over off the inside first turn, set
the pace for five furlongs, vied into the far turn closest to the inside, was tiring when in tight and steadied midway on that bend, continued to fade stretch.

Footnotes
TRIPLE RED ACES broke on top, cleared before a furlong, set all the pace, shrugged off a brief bid turning for home, well clear, kept to task. CHECK ME
OUT fell back to trail after the start, moved out, four wide, traffic turn, rallied well out in the course and finished willingly to be in time for the place.
ARKANSAS ZONG back off the pace and the inside, bothered slightly past the furlong marker when a rival drifted in, quickly recovered, late interest,
narrowly missed the place. CURIOUS APRIORITY chased the winner up the backstretch toward the inside, moved a bit closer late in the turn briefly
continued to chase past midstretch and weakened. APRIORITY ROCKET forwardly placed early, weakened after three furlongs. BUD WON within striking
distance for three furlongs, drifted in past the furlong marker, had little left for the drive. MARVINS' WARRIOR remained back, failed to threaten. C P'S WILD
FIRE balked at loading, last to leave, four to five wide turn, trailed home.
