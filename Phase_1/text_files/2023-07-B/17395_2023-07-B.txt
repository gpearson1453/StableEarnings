HURRY ON OUT gained on the backside chasing through the turn dueling abreast rival down the lane getting up under full extension. TIME TO MEDDLE
prompted the pace shaking clear on the far turn being hooked along the rail in upper stretch battling gamely to the wire. SAILOR'S CHANCE advanced
steadily to loom on the outside of rivals down the lane lacking a final surge. JOHN'S KID pressed the early pace tiring on the far turn. UNKEMPT slow early
was no factor. BLACK BULL hustled along tired on the far turn. MR MAYHEM raced evenly through the backside then flattened out on the far turn. MR
YETTIE folded up after a half mile.

Footnotes
MACHINIST pressured the pace dueling abreast throughout getting up gamely. PROFESSIONAL stalked the pace through the turn chasing down the
stretch vying gamely to the ehd. DOCTOR LEE stalked on the inside vying willingly late. BEYOND GONE pressured the pace dueling along the inside in
upper stretch coming up a touch short at the end. CHATTERMAN played no factor. CAVALLOTTO was always outrun. DREAM SATURDAY was never
involved.
