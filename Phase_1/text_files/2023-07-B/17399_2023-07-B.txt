Footnotes
MIDNIGHT METAL broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, was well handled through decent fractions along the backstretch run, drew to a
clear lead nearing the quarter marker, drew off in the stretch run, was kept to moderate urging to the final sixteenth and was much the best. TAKE THE
TWO TEN settled outside of rivals into the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run, was coaxed along four wide to the quarter marker, was not
able to impact the winner in the stretch and was outkicked, while holding for second at the finish. GORDY'S BOY stalked the decent early pace while
outside of rivals, chased MIDNIGHT METAL through the backstretch run, lost ground while two then three wide along the far turn, could not muster the
needed late response and just missed for second, while clear in the end for third. MR BOTANICALS settled two then three wide early on, maintained his
position through the backstretch run, mounted a three then two wide bid approaching the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the final furlong and
weakened in deep stretch. DI LAURIAN was forwardly placed into the first turn, lost a bit of ground heading into the backstretch run, raced within aim to the
far turn, could not keep pace heading into the drive and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
STORMIN GALILEO raced close to the early pace, took command nearing the half-mile marker, showed good speed along the turn and carved out quick
fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear heading to mid-stretch, was kept to task into the late stages and was ridden out in the final sixteenth as much the
best. ALMANERA (IRE) chased the solid pace while outside of a rival, was roused four wide into the stretch, closed well in the final stages, could not impact
the winner in deep stretch and was up in time to secure second. BOSS OF THEMOSS broke alertly and showed good early speed, lost the lead to
STORMIN GALILEO heading to the half-mile pole and chased that rival through quick fractions to the quarter marker, gave chase to mid-stretch, weakened
in the final stages, was just edged for second and held for third. MR. CLUTCH chased the fast pace from the inside, was steered three wide into the stretch,
ran evenly to the furlong pole, lacked a late response in deep stretch and missed for the minor awards. THE SANDY SURPRISE was away from the gate
slowly and was a bit slow into stride in the early stages, spotted the field into to the turn, swung to the three path for the drive and did not factor.

R M C HOOK'EM raced close to the solid early pace, pressed SPEEDY TOM along the turn, took a narrow lead into upper stretch, shook free from
SPEEDY TOM inside of the furlong marker, responded to steady urging approaching the sixteenth-pole, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted for
the win at the finish. DAD BOD stalked the quick early pace from the inside, checked while in tight approaching the turn, chased from the rail nearing the
quarter marker, was steered to the three path for the drive, rallied inside of the furlong pole, confronted R M C HOOK'EM in deep stretch but could not get
by the winner in the final strides and held safely for second. MUAY THAI (IRE) chased the solid early pace while outside of rivals, came three wide to the
quarter marker, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch, closed well in the final stages and was up in time to secure third. HAY JUAN lost his path leaving the start
and was away a bit slowly, chased the fast early pace while inside of rivals, saved ground to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground heading to mid-stretch,
re-rallied in the final sixteenth and missed for third. SPEEDY TOM broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace into the turn, dueled
with R M C HOOK'EM to the quarter marker, lost the lead to that rival into upper stretch, fought back to the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages.
FULLY LOADED broke in a tangle and was off slowly, chased from the rear while coaxed along in the three path, was able to gain ground in the stretch
drive but failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
JERSEY BABE raced close to the solid early pace and pressed VALERIE into the turn, dueled with that rival to the quarter marker, battled against the
stubborn VALERIE to mid-stretch, shook free into the final furlong and edged away in deep stretch to prove best. BRONZE ONE stalked the solid early pace
while outside of the leading pair, was coaxed along three wide to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch, closed well in the final sixteenth and
won the nod for second on the wire. VALERIE broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace into the turn, dueled with JERSEY BABE to
the quarter marker, continued to stubbornly battle with that rival to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong, weakened in deep stretch and
nailed on the line for second, while clear of the rest for third. DANZ TILL TEN was well placed in the early stages and tracked the solid pace from a two wide
path, chased to mid-stretch, was not able to impact the leaders in the final stages but was gaining late. DARK MYSTERY raced close to the solid early pace,
saved ground along the turn and lost position nearing the quarter marker, was outrun to mid-stretch and did not offer a late response. RAY AND KRIS was
away slowly from the gate and was green in the early stages, trailed into the turn, bolted to the outside rail along the bend and did not factor in the stretch.

Footnotes
AUTISM INCLUSION raced close to the early pace while four wide into the turn, was steered to the three path nearing the quarter marker, was roused into
the stretch and mounted a bid from the three path into the lane, overtook HAYWOOD inside of the furlong pole, was kept to task to deep stretch and drew
away in the final stages. HAYWOOD was prominent leaving the break and and pressed the fast early pace while between runners, took a narrow lead along
the turn, held AUTISM INCLUSION at bay to mid-stretch, could not hold that one off inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished, while holding for
second. BOOK EM TAMO climbed in the early going and chased from the rear, saved ground into the turn, was steered outside of rivals and mounted a four
wide bid in upper stretch, could not muster the needed late response but did offer a mild rally in the final stages and missed for second, while holding safely
for third. CORAL CAT broke alertly, showed good early speed and contested the fast early pace while inside of rivals, lost position along the turn, chased to
the furlong marker and faded in the final stages. LAKERVILLE ROSE chased the fast early pace, was steered three wide along the turn, mounted a three
wide bid to come within aim nearing the furlong marker, could not sustain that run in the final furlong and weakened. REGAL REDWOOD raced close to the
fast early pace, pressed the solid fractions while three then two wide between runners, lost position into the drive and tired in the late stages. CONQUEST
SECRET chased the solid early pace while widest into the turn, lost ground while five wide approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace into upper
stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LADY GREGORY was forwardly placed leaving the break and pressed the decent early pace while outside of rivals, came five wide into the turn and was
asked for run four wide nearing the top of the stretch, confronted THREAD COUNT in upper stretch, battled with that rival to the furlong marker, made
contact with THREAD COUNT inside of the furlong pole, dueled with THREAD COUNT into the final sixteenth, drifted in under firm right handed urging in
deep stretch and drew clear in the late stages to prevail. THREAD COUNT broke alertly and contested the decent early pace while outside of a rival,
disputed the pace with SUE GENEROUS along the turn and while four wide nearing the quarter marker, took a narrow lead into upper stretch, was
confronted by LADY GREGORY and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, made contact with LADY GREGORY inside of the furlong marker, dueled
into deep stretch, steadied and altered course when LADY GREGORY drifted in inside of the sixteenth-marker and held for second at the finish. DRAW
NEAR chased the decent early pace, raced close to the pace while two wide and between runners on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, was
outkicked in the final stages and held safely in the end for third. JERSEY STAR hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to chase the
decent early pace while not far back, advanced while four wide on the turn, was coaxed along six wide into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong marker, did
not offer a late rally and passed tiring rivals in the final stages to improve position. JAYS ANGEL traded bumps with CREATIVE MOTION leaving the break,
raced a bit in tight in the early stages and was shuffled back at the five-furlong pole, chased from toward the rear into the turn, saved ground to the quarter
marker then swung five wide for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in the final furlong and passed tiring rivals late to improve
position. SUE GENEROUS was sent to contest the decent early pace, disputed the pace along the turn with THREAD COUNT while inside of that rival, lost
position into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. CREATIVE MOTION exchanged bumps with JAYS ANGEL leaving the start and was a bit keen in
the early stages, chased the decent pace from the inside into the turn, steadied while in tight quarters nearing the top of the stretch, could not keep pace into
the drive and gave way. SHEZA QUEEN BEE was slow into stride leaving the break and lacked early speed, was steered five wide into upper stretch and
did not factor. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT
INVOLVING LADY GREGORY AND THREAD COUNT DID NOT COST THREAD COUNT THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING AND RULED
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH. THERE WAS ALSO A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF
THREAD COUNT AGAINST THE RIDER OF LADY GREGORY AND THAT OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
PLAYING HARDBALL was sent from the break and seized the early lead, repelled an early inside challenge from GRAZEN SUN at the half mile marker,
sprinted clear again through the turn and finished strongly to win clear. BLAZING JAMIE reserved to the turn then launched a sustained rally three to four
wide around the turn and was gaining on the winner but was never a serious threat. ROBIE broke well then settled just behind the two pacesetters while
holding an inside position, started a forward move near the half mile pole then got blocked and had to wait for running room, dropped back to last through
the turn then re-rallied through the stretch to gain third. GRAZEN SUN came away well and tracked the leader to the half, made a move ON PLAYING
HARDBALL up the inside near the seven-sixteenths pole then was unable to keep pace when that one quickened away, stayed near the rail and tried to
hold position but was edged out for third. STARSHIP CHEWBACCA stumbled after the break then was encouraged to join the early leaders, backed off a bit
near the mile pole, made a brief move from the five sixteenths pole then stalled before the final furlong and trailed the field to the wire.

Footnotes
SLEW'S JOY got away from the gate in good order, pressed TOWN PERFORMER to the stretch, ran a bit green while matching strides to the furlong
grounds then straightened out and gained a clear advantage in the final yards. KERRY GOLD raced close up while tracking the pace, saved ground through
the turn, drifted out to the four path entering the stretch and finished up well to gain the third spot. TOWN PERFORMER broke sharply and was sent straight
to the lead, set a solid pace with SLEW S JOY pressing the issue to the outside, gamely battled that rival to deep stretch and gave way in the final yards.
MY BUCKET LIST raced close up but wide down the backstretch and through the turn, rallied into the stretch then had some trouble navigating around
KERRY GOLD in deep stretch but was able to hold the fourth spot. WESTERN CAPE got caught wide in the initial stages racing with the trailing group,
continued to race wide on the turn, made a tepid rally in the stretch but was not enough gain a placing. SMILING FELON veered in after the break, making
contact with BID ON THE PRIZE then continued to lean on that foe for a few strides, made steady progress through the field while keeping to the inside,
was with a chance at the top of the stretch then flattened with a furlong to run. BID ON THE PRIZE took up sharply when SMILING FELON took the path
after the start, once clear of that one was well behind the field yet swung out to the six path down the backstretch rallied widest of all around the turn, came
into the stretch six wide and finished with some interest. MAJESTIC COTTON displayed some early food while under a ride from the start, kept up with the
tracking group to the turn, dropped off the pace in the turn then re-engaged when surrounded by a couple of rivals near the five sixteenths pole, ran on
evenly thorough the lane. VINNIEBOB was caught wide from the break, lacked any early speed, was under a drive from the half but was never a factor. ZEE
PERFECT STORY was slow into stride then prompted to keep in a touch with the field, was making some forward progress into then came off the bit, lost
interest and was allowed to gallop to the finish line.
