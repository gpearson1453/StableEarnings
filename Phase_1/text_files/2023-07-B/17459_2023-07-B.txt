Footnotes
BELLO CREEDO cleared from off the inside midway on the first turn, rated in showing the way up the backstretch and into the far turn, shrugged off a brief
bid from the runner up turning for home, stayed clear to the wire under steady handling. CINCO RICHIE settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer to
the winner late in the final turn, could do little more with that one through the lane, well clear of the others. ALLIGATOR CRAWL last to leave, began moved
up to mid pack before a half, split foes into the lane, edged clear of the others while not a threat to the top two. MIDNIGHT OIL fell back to trail after the
start,moved out and lodged a four wide middle move into contention through the final turn, flattened out through the stretch. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN broke
back, lacked speed, improved position in the three path without posing a serious threat. BUCK'S GLORY raced n the main body, two path into the lane, also
lacked a serious closing kick. COTTONCLUB SOLDIER vied early inside the winner, fell back when a bit keen first turn, chased that same rival for the next
four furlongs, had little left for the drive,. PRINCE OF GLORY in the second flight early, was finished after a half. CHIEF KIMOSABI in mid pack early, also
fell back after a four furlongs and was done. C. F. CONGRESS fell back to trail after a quarter, saved some ground into the far turn, steered out to be five
wide into the stretch, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LOST GOLD back off the pace when five wide into the first turn, stalked the soft splits in the run up the backstretch, advanced and took over from the
outside turning for home, drew out under token encouragement to win ridden out. SHOETRICK lacked speed in trailing early, raced with the winner inside
that one into the far turn, tipped out a bit after falling off that rival three furlongs out, rallied four into the lane, proved no match for that same rival, clearly
second best. KAT'S SOLDIER settled in mid pack, asked along three wide in some traffic second turn, lost contact with the top two in upper stretch, along
late for the show. COLE'S SENSATION pulled early when prompting the issue through the first turn, put a head in front before a half, showed the way into
the far turn, began to weaken when headed by that rival soon after. POWER MASTER four wide when off the pace in the first turn, lacked a closing
response. BOSS MAN ZONG pulled hard while between horses forcing the issue early, continued to race forwardly up the backstretch, gave way readily in
the far turn. VERDUNVILLE set a soft early pace under restraint and gave ay after a half.

DONEGAL MISCHIEF balked a bit at loading, broke with the field, forwardly placed early inside, asked a bit to maintain continued position along the rail into
the turn, accelerated sharply when called on for run into the lane and quickly put the field away under firm handling in a promising debut. SUNNY
SASSICAIA back off the early pace, moved out, came four wide and between horses out of the turn, rallied to be clear for the place while no threat to the
winner. JOSIE'S PRIORITY within striking distance behind the first flight, moved out a bit to be four then five wide turning for home to lose some ground,
mild rally late to be up for the show. KNOT THE ONE vied early while outside, dueled with the winner through much of the turn, could not match that one
into the lane and continued to weaken to lose the show. PRINCE COSMO raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide through the turn, lacked a
serious bid while picking off a couple of tiring rivals. FLASHY LOVER last to leave, trailed early, failed to menace while racing in a bit of traffic through the
lane. INGLIS forwardly placed for three furlongs, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
TALK TO TOKEY took control into the first turn, clear onto the backstretch, rated kindly the middle half, drew off steadily through the lane to win ridden out.
TIME TO MOVE settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the final turn and into the stretch, proved no match for the winner in chasing that one
past the furlong marker, fully extended to hold the runner up spot late. FORGED IN STEEL lacked any speed inside, continued to save ground second turn,
roused for the drive, lodged a mild rally up the rail to be slowly getting to the runner up late. BONUS APPRECIATION in a bit tight at the break to be last
away, trailed for a half, four wide into the lane, displayed some mild late interest to improve position. GOLDEN QUALITY chased the winner for six furlongs
and weakened entering the stretch. QUARTER RAT back off the pace and the inside, four wide exiting the final turn, failed to muster a rally. MICHAEL'S
BAD BOY forwardly placed for a half, retreated.

Footnotes
STOP SHOP N DROP lacked early foot off the inside, steady advance while four wide through the turn, five wide into the lane, kept coming past the furlong
marker, challenged late, edged in the final strides under firm handling. JUST A WIN hopped at the start to race well off the early pace, fanned six wide
exiting the turn when commencing to rally, closed with continued resolve to be up for the place. CRYPTO BRAVE in the first flight well off the inside, fell
back off the leader in the turn, chased then got back to that one as the top two were joining the fray with less than a furlong remaining, outkicked for the
second spot late. GOTTEMINABIND behind the pace while racing just off the inside, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. TALENTS
HOT DEAL broke alertly, cleared to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, shook clear into the turn, continued to hold a daylight advantage past
midstretch then faltered. ROSIE SPRIT lacked early foot, dropped inside in the turn, improved slightly through the lane without posing a serious threat. MISS
E. FU in the middle of the pace while well off the inside, four wide through the turn, lacked a serious kick as well through the lane. ALL AMERICAN PAT
moved up to pressure the leader in the two path in the run up the backstretch, began to weaken through the turn. SABERFIGHT forwardly placed four wide
backstretch, began a steady fade after four furlongs. THIRSTYPROSPECT off a step slow, remained back. T J'S SUNSHINE was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
GONE ELVIS with the pace from the start while between horses up the backstretch, shook clear in the turn, held a comfortable advantage to the wire under
a steady hand ride to win ridden out. BOBBY BOY broke in, raced in the second flight inside, saved ground through the turn, continued along the inside
through the stretch, proved game for the place while not a threat to the winner. MAX IS G MONEY within striking distance early outside, four wide into the
stretch, rallied to race closest to the winner past the furlong marker, had little for that one to the wire, outfinished for the runner up spot. RITE ON SAM back
off the pace outside, four wide through the turn, five wide into the lane, advanced a bit upper then flattened out in the final furlong. DYNAMIC SUN off
slowly, remained back for three furlongs, came three wide for the drive, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. STRONG DIAMOND vied up front
early, dueled up front inside the winner for a quarter, first to blink in the turn. DA RINGO fell back to trail after the start, came five wide into the lane, made
little impact through the lane. JUST ASK WATTS vied up front while between horses, began to retreat by late in the turn. YAKETY YAK off slow and
remained always back.

Footnotes
GRAHAM 'S CRUISER bumped early leaving the gate, raced back onto the main track, advanced from between horses turn, three wide into the lane,
engaged the leaders past the furlong marker and edged clear under firm handling. MR ELVIN lacked speed inside, continued to save ground through the
turn while being asked for run, rallied up the rail to be clear for the place. JOEY'S LIGHTENING broke back, lacked speed near the back, advanced four
wide through the turn, continued to display moderate energy to be well clear of the others, not enough for the top two late. MIZSPELT dueled up front in the
two path, continued to battle up front into the lane, weakened from between horses the final furlong. NOCOMET bumped with the winner just after the start,
moved up to race in midpack, behind the leaders into the stretch, lugged out with a furlong to run and finished up evenly. JANET'S DEVIL alternated up front
closest to the inside for five furlongs, surrendered the advantage when straightened for home then continued to gradually weaken to the wire. BAQUERO'S
BIND went one paced while racing three wide, failed to menace. YOUR TIME'S COMING off a bit slow, remained back throughout. GENERAL
EISENHOWER tired while racing off the inside. THE THREE KS forwardly placed early while three wide, stopped.

Footnotes
ALTERANA broke on top, never far back while racing outside, crept closer in the three path late in the turn, long drive, narrowly showed the way past the
furlong marker then drew clear late. BINDING AGREEMENT lacked speed, moved outside, four wide turning into the stretch, staged a late rally to be in time
for the runner up spot. PRADO'S PRIORITY away well, narrowly showed the way along the inside, continued to vie through upper stretch to the inside of the
winner, proved stubborn until late when nipped for the place. EASY RUNNER off a step slow, raced back as a result, was five wide exiting the turn,
displayed some mild late interest down the middle of the strip. ANDIAMO GIACOMO completely devoid of speed for three furlongs, showed some belated
interest to improve his position. HOLY BAYOU dueled up front off the inside for three furlongs and gave way. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK failed to respond in
lacking a closing response. GOLD PUNCH popped stall doors, raced in the second flight early, beat a steady retreat.

Footnotes
STRAY CAT STRUT broke back, asked early, raced three wide through the turn, kicked down the leader inside the furlong marker and kicked well clear to
win going away. FLASH OF RAIN broke well, pressed the issue early off the inside, dueled turn, shook off the other speed to be clear in upper stretch,
offered but brief resistance to the winner then proved no match, held sway for the place. MINE YOUR BIZ in mid pack for a quarter inside, steered out five
wide for room entering the stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. TRUVY'S BANDIT void of speed along the inside, continued to save
ground through the turn, rallied down the stretch to also to finish well. CHELSEA'S GLORY last away, raced back off the pace out in the strip, four wide
turning for home, went evenly to the wire. ADDISONS WARRIOR broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled through the turn closest to the
inside, faltered entering the stretch. MEAN MEISTER forwardly placed for three furlongs, had little left for the stretch run. RUNAWAY JIM broke back, lacked
speed, six wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. OAK HILL MO remained always back to also lack a rally. SMOOTH CUSTOM in the second flight
early, backed up.
