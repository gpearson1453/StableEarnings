briefly on the turn, reached even terms in the stretch but could not get by the winner. SO STEADY raced far behind early then narrowed the gap with late
energy. BET ON DRAMA settled just off the leaders and flattened out in the stretch. OVERTHEBLUESKY lacked speed bearing out on the turn then passed
rivals very wide. PARADIGM SHIFT forced the pace outside then began weakening on the turn. DONS LAST CALL was outrun along the inside and

WILDCAT GIRL angled outside advancing on the turn then wore down the pacesetter to get up in time following a long drive. MARION GRACE stalked the
winner in the opening quarter, vied on the turn outside, rallied clear, continued gamely but was nailed. LUNA T lacked speed, angled inside then proved no
match for the top pair. BROOKLYN HEIGHTS raced close up outside early then began tiring on the turn. GOOD SOURCE broke alertly and moved away
inside, dueled through the turn then stopped. VALIANT MAJESTY was eased back early and trailed throughout then returned bleeding.

COACH HAS SIX ACES settled close up outside, took over midway on the turn, pulled clear and stayed safe. PEYTON'S COLLEGE advanced four wide on
the turn then made a gradual late again. BABY FADE angled between rivals on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. LULI'S DANCER chased inside off
the leaders and continued willingly. CLASSY MISS lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn with late energy. XENATOWN forced the pace inside then
began fading after half a mile. SCHNUER WILL hustled to the front in the two path then stopped abruptly. POWWA OF LOVE broke poorly, moved up inside
and was never a factor.

VANISHING FAITH took control early, began widening on the turn, opened a long lead and kept driving. SIRENETTA outrun early, closed well through the
stretch to gain the place. JOY'S PRIDE lagged far behind outside, remained wide with some late energy. SO SWELL lacked speed outside then narrowed
the gap while no threat. LADY SICARIA raced in closest pursuit of the winner and faltered in the stretch. CRAZY SERENA stalked the pacesetters outside
then began fading on the turn. ROLIN N CONTROLIN saved ground just off the pace and gave way readily. RISEN CHANGE lagged far behind and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
BOINTHEBACK lost position after the opening quarter, circled his field on the final turn, surged through the stretch quickly drawing away. LAST DREAM
chased near the inside, angled out in the stretch and rallied for the place. JUNGLHERLY LOVE moved off the leaders inside, continued willingly then was
vanned off afterward. LOGAN'S RUNNER forced the pace in the two path, led briefly on the final turn then weakened. PRACTICALLYMINE prompted the
leaders three wide, earned a narrow lead in the stretch then faltered. DOCTOR MAGIC lagged far behind, advanced inside with a mild bid. LT'S
JACKNTHEBOX raced off the pace three wide and lacked a rally. NORLANDER set a pressured pace inside then was finished by the three eighths pole.
FACTUM LOVE STYLE angled inside into the far turn and was never a factor. CARRICKMACROSS lacked speed and gave way readily. THE BOATMAN
lagged far back throughout.

Footnotes
MOVISITOR controlled the pace, widened before half a mile, remained clear and pulled away late while ridden out. EXIT RIGHT moved closer inside after
half a mile, angled out on the final turn then proved no match for the winner. PEOPLE FORCE settled inside and continued well while no threat.
ROADTRIPTONOWHERE raced just off the pace three wide, was asked for run on the final turn but tired. CIVIL WAR dropped back early, moved wide in
the stretch and was no factor. MR. DODA broke sluggishly and trailed early then was never in contention. SUPREME BEING dropped far behind and lacked
a response. BIG BOYS ANSWER angled inside after a quarter mile and weakened steadily. MARGIN OF AIR forced the pace briefly in the two path,
stopped and lost contact with his field.

INDY AGAIN moved off the pace outside, bid final turn, wore down leader. RUNNIN REDBIRD pursued loose pacesetter, bid to front final turn, gamely to
wire. TITANIC ROSE trailed far behind opening quarter, rallied final turn, flattened. CINNAMON DREAM dropped back inside and always outrun. LOUELLA
STREET hustled to clear advantage early, stopped and eased late. THAT'STONY'SSISTER lacked speed and gave way after half a mile.
