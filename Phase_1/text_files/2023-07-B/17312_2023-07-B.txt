I WISH I COULD chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and drew off in the
final furlong. OUTOFTHEDARK raced in the middle of the pack through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend, began a bid in upper
stretch and gained ground late. MO MO TOWN led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way from the two path coming around the turn, was
caught in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. STAGGER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and finished
evenly. EXPOUND raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and showed no kick. JOSH'S
DRAMA raced off the pace up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the two path around the turn and was empty from there. TWOTWENTYSWIFT
trailed the field through the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and was not a factor.

three path, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the finish. PUBLIC OPINION trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, saved ground around the far bend and passed tiring horses in the lane. KURT'S CHOICE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader
on the inside up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the two path and was outkicked from there. TOUR THE WORLD saved ground around
the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and showed no kick. SUMMER ALL YEAR
tracked the leader on the outside through the opening half mile, swung out to the four path for the run around the second bend and faded from there.
TEXAS HOLDEM was away from the gate slowly, raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, came around the far
turn in the four and five path and made no bid. RISKY SITUATION was urged to the front from the two path coming around the first turn, dueled on the
outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and tired in the stretch.
