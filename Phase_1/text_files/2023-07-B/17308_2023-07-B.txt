Footnotes
BELFAST BANTER (IRE) saved ground near the rear of the field, jumped well to maintain position while along the inside, advanced once in the flat given a
notch to work with and bid powerfully into contention spinning into upper stretch for the final time, overthrew the leader a furlong out and drew clear in hand
to the finish to prevail comfortably on the wire. HISTORIC HEART (IRE) tracked the top pair along the inside in closest aim of them jumping well to maintain
position, came under coaxing midway on the turn once in the flat, took over narrow command straightened away into upper stretch, dug in coming under
quick threat and was overhauled a furlong from home, ran on to chase the winner home, no match for that one, while clear of the rest and along second
best. FREDDY FLINTSHIRE was in behind foes at the start when the flag was dropped, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, jumped well to
maintain position unhurried until called upon once in the flat after the final flight, advanced strongly into contention near the head of the stretch, dug in under
a drive and ran on to secure the show honors. NOAH AND THE ARK (IRE) was also in behind foes at the start, saved ground at the tail of the field, came
under urging after the final fence and passed tired rivals in the flat. WEST NEWTON (GB) a bit washy, showed the way along the inside at times jumping
inwards to nearly leave the course just after fences three, five and seven, however maintaining just enough bounce back to get inside the dog once more
each time, settled into a comfortable rhythm and remained on hold even once in the flat until midway on the final turn when under challenge from
GORDON'S JET to the outside, yielded to that rival spinning into upper stretch for the last time and tired. REDICEAN (GB) traded a bump at the start with
SALVINO, tracked the pace along the inside jumping well to maintain position, came under urging after the final jump and tired in the flat. GORDON'S JET
(IRE) forwardly placed just off the inside tracking the leader in closest aim, jumped well to maintain position, came under coaxing issuing a challenge
midway on the final turn, took briefly command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch at the quarter pole, got headed by HISTORIC HEART
straightened away and tired. SALVINO (IRE) traded a bump at the start with REDICEAN, grew a bit rank under restraint just off the inside in mid pack, past
the stands for the initial time before settling into the second turn two to three wide, tracked the front two to three wide coming under coaxing after the final
fence and tired. WELSHMAN just off the inside just off the pace, came under urging midway on the final turn in the flat, faltered in the stretch and was eased
home to the finish.

Footnotes
GOLDEN DAGGER chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take
command just inside the eighth pole, edged away under a drive to prevail. PROUD FOOT was a bit fractious when the latch was sprung and got away half a
beat slow, then got forced to steady between rivals when each foe next door came her way, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to secure the place honors. WESTERN LANE chased just off the inside until tucked inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show honors.
MADDIE'S GRACE broke out at the start forcing PROUD FOOT to steady and bumping solidly with FLIP MY ID, led briefly before being eased off to chase
just off the inside in aim of the front, tipped three wide through the turn and was patiently handled, swung four to five wide for home, got roused straightened
away, seized command near the eighth pole and was quickly overthrown inside that station, then weakened in the late stages. NOW SHOWING bobbled
awkwardly at the break recovering outwards, raced four then three wide in aim of the front, swung three wide into upper stretch under urging, took command
straightened away briefly before being displaced by the aforementioned foe near the eighth pole and weakened to the finish. FLIP MY ID bobbled at the
break recovering inwards and got bumped solidly by MADDIE'S GRACE as that rival broke outwards and forced PROUD FOOT as a tandem to steady in
behind and between them, raced in aim briefly three wide before taking command tucked to the two path down the backstretch, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths with NOW SHOWING applying pressure outside along with MADDIE'S GRACE, took the inside route into upper stretch under challenge and
yielded straightened away, then tired to the finish.

Footnotes
DONTBELATE lugged out shortly after the start, dropped back to the inside while in hand on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back
leaving the backstretch, was roused while shifting from the two path to the four path early on the far turn, came under the crop inside the five-sixteenths,
was taken in hand briefly off heels near the three-sixteenths then carried out, rallied outside into the final furlong, drifted in while gaining coming to the
sixteenth-pole and got up to prevail. SOUPER CATCH angled in while going to the front, traveled around the first turn in the two path, showed the way while
inside of a rival, was urged along while inside on the far turn, lost the advantage at the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead,
fought on well to the finish but missed while just able to get the place. MUSICAL HEART bumped with a rival at the start then bumped with foes on both
sides early, went four then three wide on the initial turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took a short lead in the two path at the three-eighths, turned into
upper stretch under a drive, lost the lead back to the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished then just missed the place while clear for the
show. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS bumped with rivals on both sides shortly after the start then checked while pinched back between foes, dropped from the
three path to the two path on the first turn, settled at the rear, was urged along in the three path on the far turn, gained in upper stretch, drifted in near the
furlong marker and finished willingly along the rail. BREADMAN was hustled from the gate, came outward early while shadowed out by the inside rival then
bumped with a foe, went three wide around the opening bend, tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the three path on the far turn, drifted
out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. GREAT WORKOUT bumped with an opponent at the start then bumped again with that foe before
being carried out, went four wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, rounded the far turn in the two path and
was no factor.

ROCK THE WEEKEND chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
rallying to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the finish to prevail. DEE'S SPEEDSTRE got bumped at the start by
LITTLE FRAPPUCINO and in turn bumped RUN SMITTY RUN, chased the pace four then three wide advancing to take command near the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the final jumps to the finish. RUN
SMITTY RUN bobbled and was bumped at the start, chased along the inside, came under coaxing at the nine-sixteenths and tipped three wide through the
far turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to secure the show honors. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO broke out at the start bumping
DEE'S SPEEDSTRE into RUN SMITTY RUN, showed the way in hand along the inside under prompting from EXCESS DEMAND to the outside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths when displaced from the front by that rival, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. EXCESS
DEMAND prompted the pace two to three wide advancing under coaxing to take command at the three-eighths, got displaced from the front with
five-sixteenths to run, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. PAPI ON ICE traded bumps after the start with two rivals, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and tired. GINNSU WARRIOR traded bumps after the start, chased four
then three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact. REUNION TOUR struck the off side stall at the

Footnotes
QUEEN'S MARTINI bumped with a rival at the start then was hustled, raced between foes under urging, dropped from the two path to the rail near the
three-eighths pole, climbed some into the kickback at that juncture, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to the lead under a left-handed crop coming to
the furlong marker, kicked clear inside that marker and proved much the best under a hand-ride in the final sixteenth. KHOZY COLBY was away awkwardly
then bumped with a foe, moved up while showing good speed on the outside, shook clear late on the backstretch, dropped from the four path the two path
on the turn, moved to the rail while asked near the quarter-pole, was put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner outside the
furlong marker and proved no match while able to hold the place. CRAZY CAMI was urged along off the pace, went three wide early on the turn, dropped to
the two path briefly and made light contact with the winner near the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed response
while up for the show. GINUCCHA was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace between horses, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the leader
under a drive into the final furlong and tired. ILIKEFUNSIZE showed good speed towards the inside, jostled with a foe late on the backstretch, chased inside
on the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. FLOWERS FOR ME broke a bit slow, raced well back in
the field, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. ALMOND FUDGE was hustled from the start then
urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn and capitulated. LISA'S PALACE bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the
inside, dropped back significantly and lost position leaving the backstretch, raced inside to the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to
respond. SUN AND WIND pressed the pace between horses, jostled with a foe late on the backstretch, chased in the two path through the turn and had
nothing left. BERTRILLE was bumped at the start and forced out, raced on the outside under urging, traveled around the turn in the five path and was no

wide through the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a light drive and was altered
out a path inside the eighth pole as HIHELLOHOWAREYOU tipped out safely clear in front and made no impact. FLEETFOOTED coaxed from the start,

Footnotes
ORANGE FREEZE brushed the outside of the gate at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear on the outside, was roused while
angling from the two path to the five path on the far turn, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead into the final furlong, kicked clear
under a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under strong urging. BERNT AGAIN saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, was
roused while moving from the two path to the four path on the far turn, shifted five wide approaching the quarter-pole, gained outside while remaining on her
inside lead until just inside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to secure the place. MZ BIG BUCKS was well placed in the second flight while
saving ground, moved through to take the lead late on the backstretch, shook clear along the rail on the far turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch, lost
the advantage to the winner into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show. RED MOON traveled around the first turn in the two path, was
reserved towards the rear, saved ground on the far turn, was held up some behind horses from the five-sixteenths to near the quarter-pole, cut the corner
with a clear rail opening into the stretch, moved off the rail near the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. LITTLE LINZEE bumped with a rival at
the start, bumped with foes on both sides early, angled in entering the first turn, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch in
the two path and came up empty. BEA BEA KAZ bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged three to
four wide on the far turn, moved out while dropping back in upper stretch and capitulated. CLOVER STREET bumped with a rival early then was taken up,
steadied some into the first turn, rounded that bend in the two path, settled between foes, dropped back in the two path on the far turn, floated five into the
stretch and had nothing left. CAMP AKEELA bumped with an opponent early, went around the first turn in the three path, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the three path through the far turn and faded. QUEENS OVER THREES moved in while going to the front and put some foes in tight quarters,
showed the way in the two path with a clear advantage, lost the lead late on the backstretch and stopped.
