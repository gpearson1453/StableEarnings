Footnotes
SAILOR CHOW sped to the lead soon after the start and set the pace up the backstretch, widened advantage still unleashed around the turn, saved ground
and hustled up in upper stretch, came out a couple paths, took on the challenge from inside running HIGHER AUTHORITY a furlong out, turned back bid,
had plenty left in the tank and finished going away. HIGHER AUTHORITY raced in the last flight up the backstretch, gained closer contention along the rail
on the turn, hustled along two wide into upper stretch, gained on the leader then shifted to the inside, threatened SAILOR CHOW for the lead a furlong out
but failed to reach rival and had to settle for second best. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE tossed head at the start and lost a couple lengths, raced in the last flight
up the backstretch, was ridden along three to four wide around the turn and captured show in final strides. BARSTOW tracked the top trio through early
stages, hustled along three to four wide around the turn, churned on through the lane and just missed show. OSCAR WINNER WALLY raced up close two
to three wide through early stages, roused for more midway around the turn, failed to respond, flattened out and continued to tire in the drive. LUCKY LOUIE
was forwardly placed up the backstretch, came up empty around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
HERITAGE PARK set the pace through early stages and continued on top still unleashed around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, responded
willingly when called upon and finished going away. COLONEL KLINK was allowed to settle through early stages, made a move three furlongs from home,
circled up four wide at the quarter pole, raced in close range of HERITAGE PARK a furlong out but could not reach eventual winner and settled for second
best. NEW STRIPE raced in range in the early going then flattened out entering the turn, swung three wide into the lane and dug in late to capture show.
TIZHOTNDUSTY was forwardly placed racing just off the leader up the backstretch, continued in close contention around the turn, flattened along the inside
turning for home, shifted out a couple paths and got nipped for show. HEZA WILD RIDE rated off the early pace, hustled along the outside around the turn,
swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. POP'S BISCUIT raced up close through early stages, sustained close contention around the turn
then steadily weakened through the lane.

TIME GOES ON broke on top and led the way around the first turn, set the pace and saved ground up the backstretch, continued to hold firm still unasked
around the far turn, cut the corner and given cue entering the stretch run, came under right handed pressure, responded willingly and drew off through the
lane. SIR WALLY WALLY stalked the clear top pair up the backstretch, hustled along three wide around the far turn, sustained bid through the lane and
secured second best. WARRIOR'S RUN was well reserved and raced in the back through early stages, picked up the tempo two wide late on the far turn,
ran on through the lane and cleared a share. WOKE UP IN LOVE rated off the top trio up the backstretch, hustled along the rail around the far turn, saved
ground entering the lane and failed to move on. MOLLIES ROCKET raced three wide entering the first turn and placed up close just off the early leader,
continued to stalk the pacesetter up the backstretch, launched a two to three wide bid for the eventual winner around the far turn then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
C R INSTA GATOR broke alertly and sped to the lead at the start, led the way and secured inside position around the first turn, set the pace up the
backstretch with a compact flight not far behind, held off bids around the far turn, saved round entering the lane, came under a ride in upper stretch, had
more left in the tank, turned back bids and held gamely. BIG LUKE was forwardly placed around the first turn and continued just off the leader up the
backstretch, hustled up between foes late on the far turn, came two wide into the drive, stayed on with response but had to settle for second best. CINCO
DE MO was allowed to settle through early stages then let out a notch and quickly advanced along the rail near the half mile marker, waited briefly on the
inside around the far turn then hustled along past the furlong marker, cut the corner entering the lane, continued in close contention then flattened late.
SHOULDABOUGHTDABAR raced in range two wide between foes in the early going, got brushed and steadied back around the far turn, weakened then
made a four wide rebid into the lane and needed more for serious impact. PALACE GUARD was unhurried and raced in the back, loomed boldly three wide
near the quarter pole, failed to sustain bid and faded in the lane. ESPE'S GUY showed response in the early going then retreated entering the turn and
continued to tire in the drive. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AND JOCKEYS OBJECTION, SHOULDABOUGHTABAR AGAINST CINCO DE MO FOR
INTERFERENCE AROUND THE FAR TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN

Footnotes
DIAMOND OF EKATI stalked the pace along the inside up the backstretch, tipped out a path and edged closer late on the turn, moved up and given cue two
wide approaching the furlong marker, took command and finished going away. EUROWENDI settled off the pace up the backstretch, swung six wide into
the lane, rallied and finished second best. POWER TO PLAY raced in range up the backstretch, hustled along three to four wide around the turn, ran on
through the lane and prevailed for a share. WUMPMUG set the pace up the backstretch, held firm around the turn, got collared by the winner leaving the
furlong marker and gave way. SPITFIRE SUZIE was reserved racing in the back, swung wide into the lane and had a mild improve. LORI'S EYES tracked
the pace in the opening quarter, hustled along three wide around the turn and gave way in the lane. PINK PARTY PANTS raced near midpack along the
inside, saved ground and urged along the rail entering the lane, briefly edged up closer then failed to sustain bid and weakened. SWEET HOLINESS was
not too far back along the outside in early stages, dropped to the inside late on the turn and had no response. TAPICITA chased three to four wide up the
backstretch and around the turn and faded in the lane.
