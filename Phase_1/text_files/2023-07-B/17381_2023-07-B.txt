PUMP THE BRAKES zipped to a clear lead early, showed the way through the backstretch, responded to a looming threat from AGENT C, and kicked away
to an easy victory. AGENT C rated off the pace from the four path, moved up closer to the lead nearing the quarter pole, but was no match for the eventual
winner and finished gamely to prove he was clearly second best. CLEVER CONNECTION tracked inside early, was no threat to the top two leaders, and
held on for show. AMEER chased in the final turn, lost path at the head of the stretch, and missed. WIDE EYED WILEY trailed wide early and lacked a
serious rally. MAMA'S PROUD JOKE reared leaving, and chased to no avail.

Footnotes
SLEW'S BAK moved up into striking position from the five path, responded to urging near the three-sixteenth pole, rallied outside, dug in and got up late.
BON PRIX sat just off the pace while three to four wide, moved up alongside SHORTY THE SWEDE in the far turn, dueled through the stretch and was
caught in the final yards, settling for place honors. SHORTY THE SWEDE broke alertly then crossed over on the field quickly to lead the way through the
backstretch, took pressure from BON PRIX in the final turn, responded to the challenge in the stretch, and weakened in the final yards. WALKTHELINE
raced from the back of the pack, advanced quickly nearing the final turn from along the rail, rallied inside through the stretch, and missed after a good effort.
WAR GIANT returned to the paddock for a tack adjustment, tracked outside, rallied five wide at the head of the lane and faded. BORKAN tracked inside and
lost interest early.

DYLAN'S SAVE angled to the two path then settled off the pacesetter, drove inside then swept the lead, drew away to a handy victory. ALBERTA swung
outside in the final turn, closed gradually under encouragement and was along in time to secure place. LADY KALIPA hurried to the lead, drew clear leaving
the backstretch, was overtaken at the head of the stretch, and was caught late. LENT ME FIFTY broke outward bumping into SUNDROP, chased four wide
into the far turn, loomed boldly at the quarter pole, and was unable to improve her position in the drive. VIOLET CITY chased three-wide, lodged a mild bid
from along the rail but failed to threaten. SUNDROP bumped leaving then was gapped, gained closer order in the final turn but was blocked inside at the
quarter pole, and gave way. BONNIE AND MOE offered little.

PACHECO saved ground from the rail, advanced quickly inside in the final turn, grabbed the lead at the head of the stretch and kicked clear. H K RAPPER
chased five-wide through the backstretch, fanned four wide at the quarter pole, and was outkicked. COUNTY WINDS raced from the back while inside,
closed steadily, and got up in time for the show. KISS ME HELLO prompted the pace while four wide, moved up nearing the five-sixteenth pole, rallied three
wide entering the stretch and was rundown late for show. CAROSWAY set the pace from just off the rail, was under attack at the quarter pole, lacked the
rally that was needed into the stretch and weakened inside. OUR SUNSHINE last away, gained closer order, and placed a mild late rally. SMART
DECISION unhurried early, and was outrun. *POST TIME DELAY- The Post Time was delayed due to an incident in the gate.

Footnotes
MISS MCBRIDE pressed the pace under a stronghold while four wide, overtook the leader nearing the quarter pole, and drew away under light handling.
BRYNN'S DREAM broke in brushing STARLIGHT LANE, raced three wide entering the far turn, took closer order inside nearing the quarter pole, angled out
to the two path, and moved clear for second. KEEPMEINPOWER allowed to settle outside early, angled inside to the two path in the final turn, and closed
gradually under intermittent reminders. WISH ON A STAR shied from outside foe when leaving the gate, dropped back in the final turn, and bid belatedly.
STARLIGHT LANE brushed leaving, chased from the three path, angled out leaving the backstretch, and came up empty in the drive.
MIDNITRAINTOGEORJA showed the way through the backstretch, was overtaken in the far turn, and yielded in the stretch. MILITARY SASS broke inward,
stalked from just off the rail, drove three wide and faded. SPIRIT GIRL shifted out leaving the backstretch, and lost interest early.

Footnotes
SHARP DRESSED BEAU contested the pace from the four path, gained a slim lead over SMASH FACTOR approaching the quarter pole, was under
pressure through the stretch, and held firm. MAJESTIC CAFE angled down to the rail in the backstretch, swung out to the four path, loomed boldly through
the stretch but was unable to reach the eventual winner. DUNE D'ORO hurried away, chased through the far turn, drove five wide at the head of the lane,
rallied late to earn show. SMASH FACTOR quickly went to the front, saved ground while showing the way, was overtaken in the final turn, weakened
through the stretch. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER raced wide, drifted into the three path into the stretch, and offered a mild rally. BIG AL'S VISION fanned
five wide into the opening turn, moved inside at the head of the lane, and lacked a closing response. REDNECK REMARK fanned six wide leaving the
backstretch, and tired. YORKTOWN broke slow, raced wide throughout, and was finished early.

Footnotes
DOC COPE tracked inside, lacked running room after the three-eighths marker, found a seam nearing the quarter pole, cleared the lead and was kept to
task while going away. SANSOME lead the field into the backstretch, set the pace from just off the rail, was overtaken just after the quarter pole, and was no
match for the winner in the stretch. H K MELODY prompted the pace while three to four wide, rallied mildly through the stretch and held on for show. DUKE
OF DEWINTON chased inside into the final turn, dueled through the stretch but was unable to improve his position late. SMART CAT chased wide leaving
the backstretch, gained closer order, and lacked a closing response. ANOTHERFORBROOKS sat in striking range while five wide, dropped back and gave
way. SPOT ON DUDE was bumped leaving the chute, attended the pace while five wide, fanned three wide in the far turn, and tired. FROSTEDBIRD
showed some early speed and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
IMPACTO jostled away then was hustled up inside, lacked room leaving the backstretch, found room nearing the quarter pole then overtook the leader, and
drew clear through the stretch. LINCHPIN STORM bumped leaving, fanned four wide entering the far turn, went in pursuit of the leaders, and held sway for
second. FLASHFORDANI squeezed out leaving then trailed behind, gained closer order leaving the final turn, was blocked at the head of the stretch, and
dug in between for show. ZICATELA broke out leaving the gate, chased inside, drifted out coming together with outside foes, and was caught finishing on
the wire at the same time as BACKSTREET BOBBY. BACKSTREET BOBBY bumped leaving, fanned four wide in the far turn, angled inside brushing inside
rival with a furlong remaining, and finished in a dead heat for fourth. ESTIFRAAD crowded leaving, saved ground, circled into the lane, and lacked the rally
needed. BURNLEY set the pace from the five path, was under pressure by IMPACTO in the far turn, drifted off the rail at the quarter pole, and gave way late
stretch. MAGICAL LADY lacked a clear path away from the gate then was gapped quickly, gained closer order and faded late stretch. BOSS MAN CAN
blocked leaving, tracked from the rail, and lacked a bid. DANCING WILLIE raced in traffic nearing the opening turn, and lost interest.

Footnotes
LITTLE HARPER allowed to settle early, saved inside on the turn, angled out to the two path after her path closed just after the eighth pole, and got up just
in time. EYESPYMYLITTLEEYE bumped OUT FRONT leaving the gate, vied hard outside for the lead, emerged the leader into the turn, was under
pressure into the stretch and was denied in the final yards. CAPA BELLA hustled outside in the final turn, made a run into the stretch, dug in gamely late to
score the show honors. OUT FRONT bumped leaving, raced four wide leaving the final turn then encountered traffic, rallied inside and was bested for show.
EDGE OF OKOTOKS hustled away to vie for the early lead, was outsprinted to the turn, steadie near the sixteenth pole after losing a clear path, and
finished well between foes. THERUFFSIDEOFEXHI sent for outside speed, raced three wide into the far turn, drove wide at the head of the lane, and lacked
the rally needed. COUNT ON IT bumped away, chased wide in the backstretch, shifted inside after passing the quarter pole, and lacked a closing response.
SMILIN EVIE chased inside early, lacked running room in traffic at the top of the lane, and finished evenly. ENTITLED STAR offered little. DEFINITE
PLEASURE stalked the early pacesetters, swung out five wide, and yielded. KISSABLE U bumped away from the gate, and was unable to recover from the
start.
