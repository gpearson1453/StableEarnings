Footnotes
ZORINA was off the pace to the turn then made a three wide bid around the turn to engage the leader at the three sixteenths pole, dueled down the stretch
and prevailed. LONG MAY SHE RUN bumped at the start with inside rival then rushed up between horses at the half mile marker and took the lead to the
top of the stretch and was headed by two outside rivals and dueled down the stretch but was outnodded. MAYA D broke well to prompt the pace from three
wide to the three furlong marker and fell back slightly, made a rebid going into the stretch from between horses and engaged the leader, moved out to three
of four wide at the eighth pole but lacked a late kick. SNUGGLE BUNNY was allowed to settle through the turn then made a mid track rally to improve
position. I'M GONE vied for the lead from the inside to the seven sixteenths pole but failed to menace. FLY FREE bumped with outside rival at the start then
was shuffled back at the half mile marker, made a mild bid on the turn but was not a threat.

Footnotes
EZ FITZ raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then made a rail bid to mid turn, angled out to two wide and ran down the leader to clear late for the win.
SHUDDER rushed up to take a clear lead at the half mile marker and held that position to deep stretch and tired. TAP TAP HUSTO trailed the field to the
turn then saved ground around the turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch for a late run but was not enough. I'M A TRUMPER was off the pace
through the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch but only chased the leaders. PALACE PATCH raced in the middle of the pack while racing four
wide around the turn, angled in nearing the eighth pole but was not a factor. CHASING THE KING sprinted away from the gate and pressed the early pace
then retreated around the turn.

Footnotes
BARTSTER was forced out at the start then was roused to co-led to the three furlong marked and edged away slightly but was challenged going in the
stretch and was headed at the top of the stretch but came again to win the photo. SWAY BACK WHEN was off the pace on the backstretch then made a
three wide bid at the three furlong marker and engaged the leader at the top of the stretch and match strides down the stretch but was out nodded.
BATTLEOF TRAFALGAR broke in sharply at the start then rushed up to co-lead to the three furlong marker, fell back around the turn but made a late rebid
to be up for the show. ENDALE ARCH raced in the middle of the pack down the backstretch, made a three wide bid around the turn but was empty in the
drive. BARREL MAN was pinched back at the start and passed tired one in the stretch. CORTE hopped at the start and remained back. BIG PEN TEN
raced near the back but was not a factor.

marker to engage the leader at the quarter pole and drove past for a clear victory. QUICKTRIP VAN was hustled to the lead for a half then was headed at
the quarter pole and fought gamely to prove second best. MY MAN BIGGIE raced near the back early then steadily advanced from three wide and was up
for the show. ROCKYMOUNTAINTWIST was roused to the front to vie for the lead around the turn and engaged the leader at the quarter pole and tired at
the eighth pole. THREE FOR THREE raced in the middle of the pack while saving ground around the turn then moved out to four wide in upper stretch and
finished evenly. GUEST CHECK was off the pace to the quarter pole and weakened. KNIGHTED trailed through the final turn and was not a factor.

leader at the three furlong marker and took the lead at the top of the stretch but was nailed in the final jumps. JIMBO'S BIZ was allowed to settle down the
backstretch then made a three wide bid on the final turn for a late rally to be up for the show. TIGER BY HIS TAIL went to the front to a pressured lead
around the first turn and down the backstretch then was headed at the three furlong marker and matched strides with outside rival to the three sixteenths
pole and tired. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE was unhurried to the first turn then moved up the rail down the backstretch and flattened out. SUEZ raced near the
back and passed tiring rivals. TASHKENT was forwardly placed in the early stages and retreated. PERVASIVE raced wide around the first turn and down
