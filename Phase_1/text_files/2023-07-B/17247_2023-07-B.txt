Footnotes
LITTLE ROCKER took over the lead after opening stages and set a pressured pace up the backstretch, widened to a clear advantage around the turn,
hustled along two wide into the lane then shifted to the inside, had plenty left in reserve and finished going away. PAISLEY'S VISION tracked the leader on
the inside up the backstretch, chased the leader around the turn, sustained inside bid through the lane and secured second best. LIL DITTY'S KITTY was
unhurried and raced off the early pace, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung three to four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and cleared the
rest. CAMCORDIA tracked up close three wide, hustled along in contention around the turn then faded in the lane. YANKEE PRIDE raced off the top flight
up the backstretch, chased three to four wide into the lane and never threatened. GAME TO PLAY broke on top then conceded position to the eventual
winner, remained forwardly placed up the backstretch, flattened mid-way around the turn and continued to tire in the drive.

ONCE UPON A DREAM tracked the clear leader along the inside, hustled along two wide into the lane, responded under pressure, steadily edged up closer
and collared CONSTITUTION DAY near the sixteenth pole. CONSTITUTION DAY sprinted out for the lead and led the way by clear margins while under a
slight hold, continued well clear around the turn, began to tire in the final furlong, got overtaken in the final sixteenth and finished well clear over the rest.
SKYFLYER raced off the early pace, hustled along two wide around the turn, sustained bid through the lane and captured show. SPEEDBAYOU was up
close in the opening quarter then weakened and dropped to the inside, saved ground around the turn, gained position in upper stretch then flattened and
lost show. BIG VANILLA stumbled at the start, hustled up and raced behind the clear leader in the opening quarter, chased three wide around the turn then
came up empty. SCRUGGS was off a step slow at the start, raced near the back and retreated.

Footnotes
I LOVE ROCKNSTROLL set a pressured pace up the backstretch, edged away late on the turn, widened to a clear advantage in upper stretch and kept to
task under steady urging. JUSTASTROLLIN stalked three wide in early stages, launched a bid for the leader around the turn, sustained a solid bid through
the lane but had to settle for second best. TEMPLE CITY RUN tracked the top flight in the opening quarter, was ridden along three wide into the lane,
finished with response and captured a share. NATIVE HELLRAISER raced in the last flight, picked up the tempo mid-way around the turn, ran on four wide
through the lane and just missed show. DREADPIRATEROBERTS raced off the early pace, chased on the inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the
drive and lacked a needed rally. ROWDY RAY pressed the pace up the backstretch, weakened off the leader midway around the turn, sustained run just off
the inside to the furlong marker then came up empty.

HOLIDAY TICKET raced in the last flight through early stages, moved up closer three wide mid-way around the turn, swung four wide into the lane, quickly
gathered ground, swept by and finished going away. MINE MY TIME raced off the early pace, ranged up closer and slipped through along the rail late on the
turn, cut the corner, slipped through again on weakening leader approaching the furlong marker, briefly held the lead then got overtaken by the winner.
ROCK CITY ROCKET raced between foes early then dropped to last, saved ground around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and gained show.
CHICAGO CHROME was the closest pursuer of the clear leader through early stages, ran on three wide around the turn, kept on through the lane then
weakened in late stages. LIBERTARIAN raced near midpack, hustled along four wide around the turn, came out wider for the drive and lacked a needed
rally. GETTINHOT'NHERE sprinted out to the early lead, set the uncontested pace and held clear around the turn, got collared by rail running rival
approaching the eighth pole and gave way. SOUTHERN MOJO was forwardly placed along the inside, ran on two wide around the turn then retreated in the
lane.

POKER PLAY took command soon after the start and led the way around the first turn, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, widened advantage
around the far turn, saved ground into the lane and drew off under steady encouragement. BIG HEARTED FACTOR tracked the early pace along the inside,
picked up the tempo late on the backstretch, chased two wide into stretch run, sustained bid and cleared second best. FIRST LINE sat back in early stages,
hustled up around the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, showed response and gained show. BILLY YANK rated along the outside in early backstretch,
picked up the pace past the half mile marker, chased three wide into the lane, improved position then got edged late for show. FLY FIRST CLASS was
forwardly placed racing just off the pace setter, chased up the backstretch then came up empty late on the far turn. HANS GRUBER raced in contention
around the first turn then dropped to last and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
AMERICAN POSSE rated off the top two flights up the backstretch, let out a notch and quickly circled up five wide mid-way around the turn, cleared
command at the quarter pole, angled in a couple paths in upper stretch, pulled away and finisihed ridden out in the final sixteenth. TAP THE BRAKES raced
off the top flight along the outside, moved up four deep to challenge for the lead mid-way around the turn, could not move on with the eventual winner at the
quarter pole but sustained bid through the lane and finished second best. LEAPIN TY MAN tracked the top flight along the inside, tipped out a path and
headed in pursuit entering the turn, lacked a clear path past the five sixteenths pole, waited briefly then swung out four to five wide entering the lane,
finished with response, gained show and cleared the rest. STAR OF MINE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, dueled for the lead mid-way around the
turn, got overtaken by the eventual winner, ran on to the eighth pole then came up empty. ELIOT NESS briefly held a slim lead then conceded position to
STAR OF MINE and applied pace pressure, took on the whole field and dueled midway around the turn, came up empty past the quarter pole and retreated
in the lane.

Footnotes
DAY MONEY sat off the early pace along the outside, edged a bit closer late on the turn, given cue five wide entering the lane, responded willingly, swept by
approaching the sixteenth pole and finished going away. TAP ON BY dueled inside of HANDSOME STRANGER for the led up the backstretch and into the
turn, began to edge away leaving the quarter pole, widened advantage under pressure then got overtaken by the winner at the sixteenth pole. HANDSOME
STRANGER vied outside of TAP ON BY for the early lead, battled on around the turn, could not match strides at the head of the lane but kept on and held
show. ONE SOCK BILLY tracked the embattled duo along the outside, hustled up midway around the turn, swung four wide into the lane and just missed
show. DIXIE THREE G was unhurried and raced in the back, swung five wide into the lane and passed tiring foes. PRIZED TAP stalked the top pair into the
turn, hustled along the inside in upper stretch, ran on to the eighth pole then gave way. BABYS TIME TO SING raced off the pace, saved ground around the
turn then shifted three wide for the drive and failed to move on.
