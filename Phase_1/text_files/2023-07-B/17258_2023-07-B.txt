Footnotes
BIKINI NATION saved ground while being reserved off the pace, waited room nearing the quarter pole, slipped through entering the stretch, took the lead
nearing the eighth pole and drew clear. VANDULIE was allowed to settle in stride, moved up four-wide nearing the quarter pole and finished strongly for
second. NADITA saved ground while being unhurried, rallied strongly along the inside into the stretch, steadied running up on horses nearing the sixteenth,
angled out and finished fast. MALICE TOWARD NONE vied with YOUGOTTAWANTIT for the lead from along the inside, drifted out nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and weakened. YOUGOTTAWANTIT was bumped at the start by TICTALOODIE, then disputed the pace from along the outside top
the stretch and tired. TICTALOODIE broke out to bump YOUGOTTAWANTIT, then dropped back and was not a factor.

WESTERN RULE was forwardly placed early while racing three-wide, moved up to engage OLYMPIC LEGEND nearing the quarter pole, dueled with that
one to the wire and prevailed narrowly in a stiff drive. OLYMPIC LEGEND set the pace while racing slightly off the rail, responded when challenged and just
missed in a determined try. ABRAAJ MIRAGE saved ground while being close up early, angled out 3-wide nearing the three-sixteenths pole but lacked a
rally. LOOSE BALL dropped back while saving ground and failed to seriously threaten.

RESERVOIR was reserved off the early pace, moved up three-wide entering the quarter pole, found room between rivals entering the stretch, took the lead
nearing the eighth pole and maintained a safe advantage. MS FLASHY HARBOR saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride, lacked room from the
quarter pole to inside the three-sixteenths pole, angled out to follow the winner between horses, then angled in nearing the sixteenths pole and finished fast.
MARY WALKER was forwardly placed while racing four-wide, was five-wide entering the stretch and finished strongly in a steady effort. CRAZY ABOUT
YOU prompted the early pace while three-wide, came four-wide into the stretch and weakened. LADY ATTA TUDE vied for the lead from along the inside
into the stretch and weakened. ABOVE THE STARS vied for the lead with LADY ATTA TUDE to the stretch and gave way late.

ALOHA BREEZE saved ground setting the pace in hand and drew off through the stretch to win as much the best while establishing a new stakes record.
STEPUP saved ground chasing the winner, could not reach that one but finished well for second. JAMIES INHERITANCE was unhurried early, came
four-wide into the stretch and was gaining slightly late. DADS ESTRELLA was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide but lacked a rally when asked.
DRIVEWAY dropped back early while saving ground and failed to seriously threaten. MISS DYNAMIC prompted the issue from along the outside for three
furlongs and gave way.

CLOVISCONNECTION stalked the early pace while three-wide, moved up to engage LLOYDS LOGIC nearing the three-eighths pole, dueled with that one
from their to the wire and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. LLOYDS LOGIC opened clear early, set the pace racing slightly off the rail, responded
when challenged at the three-eighths pole and just missed in a determined effort. JIN TONG saved ground while being allowed to settle, angled out nearing
the sixteenth pole and was gaining slightly late. ROYAL HALO was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole
and finished in a mild rally. LANGSTON ROAD prompted the early pace from along the inside, came four-wide into the stretch and weakened. STEALING
HEARTS dropped back early and was not a serious factor.

Footnotes
TUMAC MOUNTAIN vied for the lead from between horses while three-wide, opened a clear lead entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage.
SENOR FABULOSO saved ground while being unhurried, swung out to come five-wide into the stretch and finished fast. MILEYS BLUECAT vied for the
early lead from along the inside, checked in tight nearing the five-sixteenths pole, angled out to come four-wide into the stretch and was gaining late. UNION
BLISS hesitated and then hopped at the start to get away well behind the field, rallied six-wide into the stretch but was unable to recover the lost ground.
HULA KING prompted the issue while racing four-wide and weakened. SIERRA MELODY vied for the early lead while racing two-wide and tired. THE
STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND ALSO THE INCIDENT NEARING THE FIVE-SIXTEENTHS POLE BUT AFTER
VIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
