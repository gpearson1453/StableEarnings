Footnotes
KRABI tracked the pace three and four wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, steadily gained and was up late. ESKIMO STREET stalked the pace
three wide, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied to midstretch, drew clear leaving the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. I LOVE IRELAND hit
the starting gate hard enough to briefly unbalance the rider but was still away toward the front of the pack, prompted the pace inside, lacked a clear lane in
upper stretch, angled out leaving the eighth pole and ran on for the show. SONG AND TAP went evenly while racing three and four wide. MYSTICAL LADY
set the pace in the two path, was collared midway around the far turn, fought on inside past eighth pole weakened from there. HEART OF THE BEAST
failed to menace while racing two wide. SCHNOOKIE RYAN lost contact down the backstretch, was pulled up and walked off.

Footnotes
CHEROKEE stalked in the four path, bid under a ride midway around the turn, took the lead and was cued right handed while still in the four path at the top
of the lane, and opened up under a drive. MISS ATHLETIC bumped with an outer foe at the start, was nudged along while up close in the two path early,
had to check passing the half, drifted outwards turning into the stretch, and chased on while continuing to drift out for place. MY BLESSING trailed from the
four path into the turn, was driven into the lane, and kept on between foes for show. BIANCA LUNA chased in the five path, was floated out to the six path
into the stretch, and evened out. BEAUTIFULLYPERFECT bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, swung out to the nine
path turning into the lane, and did not threaten. BAHAMIAN BABY rated along the rail early but was no menace. LITTLE CARLEY broke out at the start, led
in the three path early, shifted inwards into the turn, but faded from the two path down the lane.

DIGNIFIED brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the four path, was roused to bid from the three path passing the three eighths pole, took the
lead passing the quarter and was in the four path entering the stretch, and drew clear. SHEZA HAPPY GIRL set the pace inside, was coaxed from the two
path passing the three eighths pole, lost the lead passing the quarter, but kept on down the lane to secure place. CAPRIDREY had a slow start, raced off
the pace inside, advanced to show position from the rail rounding the turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, and finished evenly. RAW HONEY
had her head turned and got pinched at the start, prompted the pace between foes in the three path, but faded around the five path turning into the stretch.
NO DECAF bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the five path but was empty entering the lane. SCENIC VIEW was up close between foes in the
two path early but backed up rounding the turn.

DREAM KNIGHT settled off the early pace while racing three wide, tipped four wide nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, seized
command nearing the eighth and drew off under a drive. NATURAL VIBES lacked early speed, saved ground throughout and rallied for the place. FORT
ATTITUDE bumped with SUPER UNISON at the start, dueled in the three path, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but kept trying and
saved he the show. STEALTHTHIRTYFOUR dueled in the two path to upper stretch and weakened. BIG BUCKSALOT chased the pace five wide and
lacked a closing bid. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH failed to menace while racing three wide. KING OF TRUTH had only brief speed four wide. SUPER UNISON
bumped at the start, raced six wide around the turn and never threatened. PACIFIC LEGEND trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
DANZIG CHIPS set the pace in the two path, was roused passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path in upper stretch, and held on. LAST SHIFT
bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace inside, advanced under coaxing from the rail around the turn, and ran on inside of foes down the
lane for place. HOW SURPRISING brushed with an outer foe at the start, travelled up close in the five path, lost position outside of foes rounding the turn,
fanned out to the nine path into the lane, and kept on down the center for show. CLASSIFY prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the three path passing
the three eighths pole, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, and finished evenly to miss minor placings. BELTS 'N BROOKS bumped with an outer
foe at the start, tracked in the three path, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, altered inwards to the six path passing the eighth pole, but was one
paced. FIFTY ONE FIFTY was wellback in the five path early and made no impact. UNCAPTURED BOY brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased in
the six path but was no menace.

Footnotes
BEACH READY stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes midway around the far turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, vied inside of
PASAJERA from there to wire and dug in to prevail. PASAJERA tracked the pace three wide, perched just outside of the winner, bid outside of that foe
midway around the far turn, battled to the wire but could never by. RESONANCIA had her head turned at the start, raced off the pace two wide, moved up
four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. ONE TRACK MINE chased the pace three and four wide and lacked the needed rally. LOVE
UNLIMITED lacked speed, raced three and four wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane. X Y LADY set a clear pace in the two path around the first turn, led
at the rail around much of the far turn and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. FUNTASTICA was off a step slow, raced five to six wide and never
threatened. ROYAL JUBILEE had her head turned at the start and made little impact while racing four and five wide. CHARLESTON WAY was outrun while
racing two wide. ANTRIM steadied entering the first turn, was in range inside and faltered around the far turn.

FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP set the pace inside, was coaxed in the two path nearing the quarter, tipped out to the four path entering the lane, gradually drifted
out but held safe. FIRST TEAM stalked in the four path, was roused around the three eighths pole, floated out to the seven path into the stretch, and ran on
for place. DREAM OF BLESSINGS rated in the three path, was driven along while fanning out to the eight path into the lane, and was along for show.
NOWITZKI prompted the pace in the three path but faded from the five path into the stretch. RACKET tracked in the two path but was empty entering the
lane. RED'S REVENGE always trailed around the two path.

GOOCH GO BRAGH tracked in the three path, loomed up after a right handed cue from the six path rounding the far turn, took the lead while in the four
path at the top of the lane, and drew clear under a drive. WINNING FACTOR settled in range from the three path, tipped to the rail and was roused into the
far turn, cut the corner into the stretch, and kept on for place. WATCH THE MUSIC set the pace around the three path, was roused from the two path early
around the far turn, lost the lead while between foes entering the stretch, but held show. WAR CROSS trailed inside, was coaxed into the far turn, had to
check while in the three path nearing the three-sixteenths, angled in to the two path passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND
stalked in the four path, was driven between foes around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. DREAM OF A DAY brushed with an inner foe at the start,
raced off the pace in the two path but did not threaten around the five path down the lane. EL SOCIO rated in the five path but was no menace from the six
path in the stretch. SARAWAT brushed with an outer foe at the start, prompted the leader from the four path but backed up between foes around the far
turn.
