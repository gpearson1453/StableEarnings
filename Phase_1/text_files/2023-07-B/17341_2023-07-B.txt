Footnotes
GLAMOROUS LIFE tracked the top pair up the backstretch, edged a bit closer around the turn, hustled along three wide into the lane, continued to chase
after the clear leader in upper stretch, kicked in gamely in late stages and ran down stablemate in closing strides. JAZZ BRUNCH pressed the pace up the
backstretch then took command near the three eighths pole, held firm around the turn, coaxed two wide into stretch run, pulled away to a commanding lead
then got caught by stablemate nearing the wire. REINA DEL SUR was unhurried and settled off the early pace, hustled up three turning for home, sustained
a steady bid and cleared the rest. CHAMPAGNE BLING was well reserved racing in the back, swung five wide into the lane and failed to move into
contention. JACK'S PARTY GIRL set a pressured pace through early stages, got collared by JAZZ BRUNCH entering the turn, had nothing left in reserve
and retreated through the lane.

FREE MAKER rated off the pace through early stages, crept a bit closer late on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, dueled four wide a furlong out,
shook free and held late under a driving finish. AIR JOCK stalked the pace up the backstretch, waited for a clear path on the inside around the far turn,
tipped two wide for the drive, advanced to duel for the lead, raced in tight quarters and got brushed between foes, could not move on with FREE MAKER in
the final furlong but stayed on with good response. SHIPS ON FIRE tracked the pace three to four wide, hustled along four wide entering the lane, angled in
a path and dueled three deep for the lead, got overtaken by the winner past the furlong marker but ran on and secured a share. CYBERTOWN was off slow
at the start and raced in the back, edged closer late on the far turn, swung five wide into the lane and had a mild improve. WICKED PRINCE set the pace up
the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, dueled for the lead in upper stretch, battled on to the eighth pole then gave way. BREAD WINNER was
forwardly placed sitting just off the early leader, launched a two wide bid around the far turn, flattened turning for home and gave way in the lane.

WILD BOUT HILARY led the way in opening stages then took on the challenge of LITTLE TAP DANCER, dueled with rival into the turn, shook free leaving
the quarter pole, widened to a clear advantage and kept to task under a driving finish. MITOLE'S LEGACY hustled along in contention then waited for a
clear path on the inside around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, headed in pursuit and finished well. LITTLE TAP DANCER advanced to challenge
WILD ABOUT HILARY for the lead in opening stages, dueled into the turn, could not match strides past the quarter pole but ran on through the lane and
secured show. KANT RESIST IT was forwardly placed in opening stages, raced in aim three wide at the five sixteenths pole, flattened and drifted wider
turning for home, angled in a couple paths and needed more for late impact. SPANGLE raced in the back although never too far back from the frontend,
chased in range along the inside around the turn, cut the corner, ran on briefly then gave way. CAN'T WANT THAT was not far back chasing three to four
wide through early stages then flattened late on the turn.

Footnotes
CUPIDS SWEETY raced near midpack and dropped to the inside nearing the turn, chased along the rail and sustained bid turning for home, roused forward
along the rail to take a slight edge at the eighth pole then kicked clear. THAT'S OUR VISION raced up close three wide in the early going, raced in aim
around the turn, was no match for the winner in the final furlong but continued to put in effort to hold place. QUIET I'M NOT raced in contention tracking four
wide in early stages, hustled along four wide leaving the turn, sustained bid through the lane and just missed place. SHEZAWILDSTORM was forwardly
placed through the early going, pressed two wide around the turn, evened out a bit and lost path in upper stretch, moved to the inside in late stages and had
no late kick. JAYDENSQUEENOHARTS sprinted out to the early lead, held a slight edge around the turn, got collared by the winner at the eighth pole and
gave way. NATUSIA raced off the early speed, coaxed three wide into the lane and failed to kick on. BEAUTIFLY TROUBL'D raced off the pace, swung four
wide into the stretch run and failed to threaten. LUCYS STROLL lacked early speed, came two to three wide into the lane nd never menaced. SUPINE
DUCHESS saved ground and failed to move into close contention. CLASSIC CASH showed little.

Footnotes
DREAMINONTHENILE sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace and held firm over pursuers around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane
and pulled away under steady encouragement. FLAT OUT ROSE raced in contention along the inside, continued in striking distance around the turn, tipped
two wide for the drive, was no match for the pulling away winner but sustained a steady bid and finished clearly second best. RISKY WHISKY raced off the
early pace, picked up the tempo entering the turn, swung five wide into the lane and secured a share. CONFETTI BETTY was forwardly placed up the
backstretch, sustained bid around the turn then gave way. SHELBY TO raced off the pace, hustled along two wide into the lane and never threatened.
GARBO SPEAKS was not far back in the early going, chased three to four wide around the turn then retreated. KASA raced two to three wide in range then
came up empty near the quarter pole.

Footnotes
PERFECT WISH broke sharp on top and held a slim lead around the first turn, edged away and held clear on top midway up the backstretch, continued to
hold clear still unleashed around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, shook the reins a couple times, responded willingly, pulled away and finished
wrapped up. MY HAPPINESS saved ground and settled off the top two flights entering the backstretch, edged closer along the inside near the half mile
marker, launched a two wide bid for PERFECT WISH around the far turn, angled to the inside in upper stretch, was no match for pulling away winner but
stayed on with response and held place. LAVENDER LIL was well reserved racing in the back, gained closer contention along the rail around the far turn,
tipped three wide for the drive, sustained a steady bid, got edged for place and finished well clear over the rest. TARA'S TIME stalked the leader up the
backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn and weakened through the lane. DIAL SUM IN tracked the pace up the backstretch, hustled along
three to four wide around the far turn then faded in the lane. REASON OVER RICHES rated along the outside not too far off the leaders midway up the
backstretch, came up empty around the far turn and steadily retreated. WITSEC pressed the pace around the first turn and into the early backstretch then
came up empty.

Footnotes
FLAT OUT STORMIN raced near midpack and saved ground around the first turn, rated just off the pace up the backstretch, edged closer around the far
turn, cut the corner and hustled along the inside entering the lane, slipped through a narrow opening to challenge ANGELS MELODY for the lead, gained a
slight edge leaving the eighth pole and finished going away. ANGEL'S MELODY sped to the lead soon after the start and led the way around the first turn,
set the pace by a length advantage up the backstretch, held off bids around the far turn, continued to hold a narrow lead turning for home, came under firm
right handed pressure racing two wide, got collared by rail running winner leaving the furlong marker and had to settle for second best. JUST LIKE TRISTA
was off a step slow at the start and remained reserved racing in the back, edged a bit closer late on the far turn, swung six wide into the lane, rallied along
the outside and gained on place. KELA'S TURN stalked the pace up the backstretch, launched a two wide bid near the quarter pole, continued in close
range in upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. INTERSTELLA tracked the early pace, chased three to four wide in range around the far turn then
gave way. MISS PEACH settled through early stages, was ridden along five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. BOSSY MOMENT raced off the early
pace, hustled along two wide around the far turn and failed to move into close contention. KAYLA raced in range up the backstretch, coaxed four wide
around the far turn then came up empty entering the lane.
