Footnotes
NAVY SOUL chased along the inside early on, dropped back while shifting off of the rail to race towards the rear two wide nearing the far turn, shifted out to
the five path at the three furlong pole, tipped wider while following BATUKHAN (IRE)'s run approaching midstretch, rallied in pursuit of that new leader in the
final sixteenth and caught him at the wire. BATUKHAN (IRE) tracked from the four path, pressed down the backstretch before chasing around the far turn,
shifted outwardly in upper stretch, sustained a grinding charge to reel in the tiring leader at the sixteenth pole, but drifted out as an outer rival challenged in
the late stages and was caught in the shadow of the wire. CRONUS dropped back soon after the start, tugged forward between horses to a tracking position
entering the backstretch, bid for the lead three wide at the nine sixteenths pole vied with an inner rival while in the three path into the far turn, led turning for
home, drove clear in upper stretch, drifted inwardly at the furlong grounds, but tired soon after, was caught by an outer rival at the sixteenth pole and
weakened. TROPIC STORM vied along the inside while a bit off of the rail early on, moved down to the fence approaching the five furlong pole, but failed to
sustain vying position leaving the nine sixteenths marker, pursued from the two path around the far turn, then kept on between horses through the lane to
miss re-reaching show late. BLAME SHIFTER saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. NOTION prompted the pace two wide, led nearing the far turn as
an outer rival applied pressure, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole, yielded entering the lane and faltered between horses at the furlong
grounds.

Footnotes
CRAVENSWORTH laid off of the pace along the inside, was driven hard while saving ground around the turn, gained on the embattled leading pair while
hugging the fence entering the lane, tipped outside of them coming to the furlong grounds, sustained progress to bid at the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
MR. COMMANDER rushed to vie two wide and between horses, dueled inside of a rival around the turn, shook clear of that one in upper stretch, but was
caught at the sixteenth pole, weakened and lasted for place. THE BIG MOZZ broke a beat slow and a touch outwardly, trailed while remaining wide early
on, improved while taking the turn in the six path, but bore to the nine path nearing the lane, yet ran on while hanging on his left lead to miss reaching place
late. REDHILL was firmly taken in hand between horses at the start, raced at the rear in the three path around the turn, shifted to the six path entering the
lane and lacked a bid. KING OF KENTUCKY broke outwardly, vied outside of the leader early on, dueled two wide around the turn, but failed to keep pace
with his inner counterpart in upper stretch and faltered. RANSAM PAYNTER bobbled a bit and leaned outwardly at the start, raced close up along the inside
in the opening stages, but failed to keep pace with an outer pair nearing the half mile pole, chased into the turn, but weakened in the four path around the
bend.

Footnotes
PASS THE HAT stalked two wide, bid around the turn, drew off at the quarter pole and lasted safely from an outer rival late. OMEX steadied out of crowded
quarters early on, raced at the rear in the three path, fanned five wide while picking up stride entering the lane, and offered a belated rally but ran out of
ground to reel in the leader. NUEVO AMANECER set the pace inside of a pressing foe into the turn, got headed at the quarter pole and gave way.
PHREDDIE MAC checked slightly in tight quarters between horses in the opening stages, laid off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide entering the lane
and moved up. LEAD FOOT saved ground but to no avail while hanging on his left lead. MENA tracked along the inside, but chased around the turn and
faded between horses. WARNING SIGNS tracked three wide and gave way. TENNESSEE LAMB broke a step slow and never got involved along the inside.
THE QUARTER MILE FRACTION WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
JUST A PHOTO tracked along the inside, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to bid in the final furlong and drove clear in the late stages. SIX
MISSIONS stalked in the three to two path, then behind the leaders around the far turn, chased in the three path in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an
outer rival in the final furlong and kept on to narrowly gain place at the wire. SOUTHERN CRUSH vied for the lead outside of a rival while in the four path
around the first turn, tucked down to the two path down the backstretch, led in the three path turning for home, inched clear in upper stretch, but was caught
at the sixteenth pole and got nailed at the wire for place. FIGHT'N READY laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four path before
spinning into the lane in the five path, and ran on but did not have enough to reach show. CURLINS INCHARGE pursued from midpack two wide, lost
position down the backstretch, saved ground off of the pace turning for home, but waited behind traffic entering the lane, then lacked a kick in tight quarters
between horses in upper stretch. TRICOLOUR laid off of the pace along the inside, but shifted out and tugged forwardly four wide entering the backstretch,
chased in the three to four path around the far turn and yielded between horses in the final furlong. COAL BOSS pursued from midpack three wide, then
between horses around the far turn, fanned six wide entering the lane and lacked a rally. SELF RULE saved ground far back, but to no avail. SAPELO
SOUND vied along the inside while a bit keen, got headed turning for home and faltered while steadying at the furlong grounds. SILVER RALEIGH raced at
the rear in the three to six path around the first turn, dropped back to lag down the backstretch, then failed to gain five wide around the far turn and made
little impact. CHANCE bobbled a bit while last away, lacked speed two wide before being floated five wide exiting the first turn, improved soon after, but
lacked a response to urging in the four path around the far turn and weakened between horses nearing the lane.

Footnotes
SEVEN FLAT tracked two to three wide, bid outside of the top pair leaving the five sixteenths pole, forged an advantage soon after, inched clear in
midstretch as an outer PRINCELY pursued, then drifted out many paths and fended off that bidder through the closing stages. PRINCELY settled off of the
pace two wide, gained four wide turning for home, took aim on the new leader in upper stretch, but was herded outwardly many paths while sustaining
pursuit through the final furlong, ranged up and offered a bid in the late stages but was denied. SINGLE RULER laid off of the pace along the inside, then in
the two path turning for home and chased the leaders home while one paced. JEWELSTOWN set the pace along the inside, got headed by the eventual
winner while inside of a trio of rivals at the quarter pole and yielded. BOLD LOOKER lagged behind in the three path despite urging from the rider, fanned to
the seven path entering the lane and moved up. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW stalked behind the leading pair and from the two path down the backstretch, but
weakened between horses at the five sixteenths pole. APOLLO RISING stalked three wide, pressed two wide down the backstretch, but was outmoved by
outer rivals leaving the three furlong pole and gave way.

Footnotes
TIMBERLAKE dictated terms outside of a rival while gradually shifting down, cleared that foe entering the turn, showed the way well in hand around the
bend, kicked away when let out a notch entering the lane, drew off readily in upper stretch under little-to-no urging and was taken in hand after the rider
searched for competition entering the final sixteenth. WEST SARATOGA broke a bit inwardly, prompted the pace along the inside through the chute, but
failed to sustain pressure at the three quarter pole, chased off of the fence before gaining place from a faltering foe into the turn, was urged along as the
leader's main pursuer around the bend, then failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane and remained well clear of the rest. CAN GROUP lacked
speed along the inside, split foes two wide entering the lane and improved late. NORTHERN FLAME transferred contact from an outer rival to an inner foe
at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path, gained show at the five sixteenths pole, vied with an outer rival for that position entering the lane, fended
that one off thereafter, but tired in the final furlong and lost show to an inner rival late. BLACK DIAMOND broke half a step slow, lacked speed four wide and
outside of rivals, inched closer in the five path around the turn to vie for show with an inner rival turning for home, but flattened out through the lane. DUTCH
MILLS took light contact from an inner rival at the start and made little impact two wide and between hroses. CARD TRICK saved ground in midpack, but
weakened. RACCOON RODEO bobbled inwardly and brushed a rival while not spotting position at the start, vied two wide and between horses, then along
the inside leaving the chute, but failed to keep pace with his outer counterpart entering the turn, shifted out and wilted in the three path around the bend.
BURGUNDY ROYALE laid off of the pace outside of rivals, but got rank when roused while losing focus at the five furlong pole, then greenly faltered three
wide and between horses entering the turn.

Footnotes
TILTED TOWERS tracked along the inside around the turn, tipped out to take aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, ranged up at the sixteenth
pole and edged ahead. ATRAS set the pace inside of a pressing rival, inherited a clear margin into the turn, took the bend a bit off of the rail, held sway from
a chasing rival through midstretch, but was collared by that one leaving the sixteenth pole and got bested. AMERICAN MAYHEM pursued from midpack in
the four path and between horses around the turn, progressed to gain show entering the lane and chased the top pair home. FIELD DAY saved ground in
midpack but lacked a bid. UNPREDICTABLE BAY was caught in the five path while midpack around the turn, then hung on his left lead and lacked a rally.
RED HORNET saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. GREGORY'S PRIDE trailed three wide, moved out of last in the four path entering the turn and
failed to factor. IMPROBABLE JOURNEY tracked three to two wide and weakened between horses entering the lane. BOURBON HEIST lacked speed two
wide, swung to the five path around the bend, then shifted inwardly in the lane and made little impact. ORIENT MAGIC prompted the leader from the
outside, but failed to keep pace nearing the turn and weakened between horses around the bend.

GROUP EIGHTEEN lacked speed, launched a gain in the five path around the far turn, bumped with an inner rival turning for home, yet sustained progress
to bid at the furlong grounds and edged clear. MASTER GAME leaned out and brushed a foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, gained inside
of rivals around the far turn, split the leaders to produce a bid entering the lane, led briefly coming to the furlong grounds, but was outkicked and second
best. REDEMPTION TIME trailed, took the far turn four wide, took contact from an outer rival at the five sixteenths pole, yet stayed on willingly through the
lane. HAVILDAR tracked the embattled leading pair from the inside, gained place from an outer rival before bidding outside of the leader at the five
sixteenths pole, led nearing the lane, but was headed by an inner bidder leaving the three sixteenths pole and weakened between horses. MAASAI
WARRIOR failed to factor from the three path. CAN'T HUSH THIS dueled for the lead along the inside, inched clear of his faltering counterpart at the half
mile pole, met a challenge at the five sixteenths marker before being headed nearing the quarter pole and weakened. MO'S TREASURE took light contact
from an inner rival at the start, tracked the leading duelers from the four path, chased while unable to produce a bid along with an inner rival around the far
turn and weakened between horses entering the lane. SHOTSHELL dueled two wide, but yielded nearing the far turn, wilted around that bend and was
eased through the lane.

PURE COUNTRY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, was held up behind foes around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, rallied
outside of the leading group in the final furlong and drove past them in the closing stages. SASSY WALKER pressed three wide, bid and gained an
advantage with five sixteenths to go, tucked two wide entering the lane, clung to a margin through midstretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth.
SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL prompted the pace two wide and between a pair of rivals, eased back at the quarter pole in odrer to tip four wide entering the
lane and chased well among foes. EVERGRANDE vied for the lead inside of a pair of rivals into the turn, got headed at the five sixteenths pole, fought on
through midstretch but yielded late. INVENTING ANNA tracked along the inside, chased from off of the fence and behind the leading group in upper stretch,
lacked room entering the final sixteenth and kept on between horses. UNDER ADVISEMENT pursued from midpack three wide, fanned five wide entering
the lane, but yielded. SAUCY SECRET failed to factor from the four path. GATHERING STORM leaned out and stuttered a step at the start, lacked speed
along the inside and faded. SOFIA'S SONATA was put to tight quarters among foes soon after the start, trailed, bore to the five path turning for home and
was outrun.
