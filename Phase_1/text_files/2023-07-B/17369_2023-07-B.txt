STARTUP MENTALITY (IRE) settled on the inside while trailing the field, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied outside rivals entering the stretch,
closed willingly, ran by MIRABELLA at the sixteenth marker and was ridden out. MIRABELLA vied two wide for the lead, dueled between rivals on the far
turn, shook free in upper stretch, dug in gamely in the final furlong but second best. MADAKET'S ARROW raced three wide early, tracked the leaders in
good position, bid three wide on the far turn, dueled, dug in through the lane and earned the show spot. LOVERS ROCK bobbled at the break, raced off the
pace inside, angled out at the top of the lane and rallied mildly outside. BLONDE SAMARITAN raced off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and
lacked a rally. MY FOREVER FRIEND raced off the pace inside, chased on the far turn and had no rally. GOMOMISCHIEF raced two wide off the pace,
between rivals on the far turn and tired. ONE OF THE ONES vied inside for the lead, dueled on the far turn and faded in the lane.

GEAUX ROCKET RIDE moved off the inside going into the clubhouse turn, stalked three wide, moved up four wide nearing the far turn, made a strong three
wide bid on the turn, dueled with ARABIAN KNIGHT, then hooked up with MAGE in upper stretch, responded to that challenge passing the furlong marker,
took charge and drew clear under urging. MAGE raced three wide early, settled off the pace between horses, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied
four wide into the stretch, made a strong bid outside of the winner, dueled heads apart passing the eighth pole, dug in gamely but settled for the place spot.
ARABIAN KNIGHT broke sharply, stalked AWESOME STRONG early on, then moved up outside to contest the pace, took over, dueled three wide nearing
the far turn, then dueled inside of GEAUX ROCKET RIDE on the far turn, weakened in the lane, then stayed on well to hold third. EXTRA ANEJO raced four
wide early, settled three wide off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn, rallied mildly and went evenly late. TAPIT TRICE raced off the pace inside,
moved up two wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. HOWGREATISNATE broke open the gate prior, raced off the pace
inside, made a rail bid at the three eights marker, dueled on the turn and faded. SALUTE THE STARS pulled early on, checked entering the clubhouse turn
and was rank on the turn, then stalked between rivals, bid four wide at the three eighths marker, chased between horses on the turn and faded. AWESOME
STRONG vied inside for the lead, dueled between rivals nearing the far turn, then gave way.

LEADING CONTENDER tracked on the inside, angled out midway on the far turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, dueled with PHELPSY and prevailed
late. PHELPSY broke slowly, pulled early on and rushed up into contention on the inside, took over to set the pace, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely
on the rail in the final furlong and battled to the end. JUST BEAT THE ODDS stalked three wide, bid three wide on the far turn, rallied between horses into
the stretch, could not go with the top pair, angled out and came on again nearing the finish. LIFE ON THE NILE set the early pace, then stalked two wide,
chased on the far turn and faded. MODERN ERA was outrun early, came three wide into the lane and passed tired ones. PENZANCE raced four wide early,
settled off the rail, off the pace, chased on the far turn and gave way. POWER OF NATURE raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
