chased the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that path into the stretch, drifted in and edged up for the place. SHAKIN IT
UP LARRY stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, headed and bid outside the leader into the stretch,
then evened out and held the show. SUMMERFEST hopped at the start, moved up and angled out through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran
evenly. TEAM HUCKY was never involved.

Footnotes
BEAST BUNNY stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader gaining a short lead into
the stretch, then drew off late and was kept to the task. LEMON CURRY well placed, gained position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the
stretch, then lacked the needed late kick and was unchallenged for the place. ORPHAN EXCHANGE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn,
angled four wide into the stretch and closed well for the show. IMFREEFALLIN mid pack, moved up while angling out through the turn, came five wide into
the stretch, made a steady gain and edged up for a share. SHEER ALICE (GB) well placed, gained position on the two path through the turn, came three
wide into the stretch and flattened out. LUMI set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then faded the final furlong. JAZZ TIME
GIRL never far back, moved up three and four wide through the turn, then faded into the stretch. SHE'D RATHER DANCE well placed and inside, faded
after a half. BETHPAGE reared at the start, was no factor, widest. EMALTHA was never involved.
