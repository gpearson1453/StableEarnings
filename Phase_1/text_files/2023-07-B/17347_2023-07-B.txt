the command from the two path to the top of the stretch and gave way. BIGPARTY NOWHISKEY was never a threat. KATRAKA was forwardly placed down

Footnotes
LA ROSA DRIVE went to the front to co-lead from the two path to the quarter pole and edged away, lost crop at the three sixteenths pole but was kept to
task and drew clear. LADY PHYLLIS vied for the lead from three wide to mid stretch but was no match for the winner and held of the late closing inside rival
to keep the place. REMARKABLE CHARM raced near the back through the turn then moved between horses at the three sixteenths pole and made a late
rally to just miss the place. IMA FINAL DE BUY went to the front to co-lead from the inside to the quarter pole and weakened. SNICKEL TE raced at the
back through the turn then moved out to five wide in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. HIGH VALUE TARGET was off the pace on the inside to mid
turn, fell back and was not a factor. KALLINIKI was off the pace between horses and was shuffled back at the half mile marker then retreated.

VIRTUALLY rushed up to take a clear lead and set all the pace, edged away at the top of the stretch and won going away. SUE ETTAS GHOST tracked the
leaders through the turn then made a rail bid in the stretch to prove second best. ROCKIN MARIE sprinted away then settled off the pace through the turn
but had no late kick. FLIPLIT trailed the field around the turn and passed tiring rivals. CHEROKEE PAPOOSE raced near the back in the early stages,
moved up on the backstretch then moved between horses at the quarter pole but lacked the late response needed. FLO TIME was off the pace from three
wide to the three furlong marker then dropped back.

Footnotes
COLLUSIONIST settled off the pace down the backstretch, moved out to three wide at the five sixteenths pole and engaged the leader at the top of the
stretch and drove past to prove best. TRUTH SEEKER trailed the field to the five sixteenths pole while gaining ground around the turn, moved out to three
wide in upper stretch for a late rally and just got up for the place. TULSA TIME went to a clear lead to set the pace for a half then was headed at the top of
the stretch and fought gamely in the stretch but couldn't fend off the late closer and missed the place. SWEET MEDICINE chased the leaders and never
made a bid. RAMBLIN' MAN was last away and roused to contention to prompt the pace to the five sixteenths pole but gave way.
