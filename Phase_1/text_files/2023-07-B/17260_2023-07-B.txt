BEA MAJESTIC G G was away alertly, forced the pace on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. ALWAY'S ROSIE stalked
the early leaders, was a factor on the turn and had a bid from the four path in mid stretch but was no match for the winner. COSMIC SHOT set a pressured
pace and dueled on the turn but gave way at the top of the stretch. LIGHTNING MARIE was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but from the five
path at the top of the stretch was no threat. TEXAS DANA was off slow, showed little and from the four path at the top of the stretch had no impact.

CRUMLIN EXPERIENCE settled off the pace, moved up on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. PARTY OF NO set a
pressured pace, had a slim lead on the far turn and vied through the stretch but was second best. BOCELLI forced the pace and dueled on the far turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was outfinished. THELONIOUS was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but from the three path at the
top of the stretch was no real threat. CALMING INFLUENCE was hustled early but lost ground on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the
stretch failed to fire. DIMMI QUANDO had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.

JACK BEANSTALK set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch held sway. LIL GREEN MACHINE was in touch,
raced evenly on the turn and was up for place. PAPERBACK HERO tracked the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch needed more. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL stumbled at the start and closed the gap on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no
impact. ROCKET JOE COPPER was unhurried early but chased on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.
