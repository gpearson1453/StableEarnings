Footnotes
FLY NIGHTLY was reserved off the pace while racing three-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and was up with a rush in the final seventy
yards. CLEAR N CONVINCING saved ground early while being allowed to settle, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and finished fast while
racing without a left fron shoe. VITALE was forwardly placed while racing two-wide, angled out to be three-wide nearing the eighth pole and closed strongly
from between horses. SON OF GRACE dropped back early, rallied six-wide into the stretch and finished full of run. OVERTHOUGHT saved ground setting
the pace and held on determinedly during the drive. EXPROMPT (FR) prompted the issue from along the outside and held on fairly well during the drive in a
steady effort. DYNABLUE steadied shortly after the start when in tight from between horses, then saved ground and failed to threaten.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS saved ground while being allowed to settle and failed to seriously threaten. BLURT was three-wide early while racing in the
middle of the field to near the stretch and tired.
