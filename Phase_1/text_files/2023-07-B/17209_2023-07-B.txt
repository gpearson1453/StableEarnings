Footnotes
BUCK'S GLORY broke in good order, dueled up front in the two path, narrowly showed the way into the far turn, was challenged by a pair of foes soon after
from the outside, second duel midway on that bend, fell back off the clear into the straight, rebid from the inside when straightened for home, proved best in
a game effort. NEPHI broke well, raced a bit keen past the wire the first time, moved out, four wide bid into the far turn, clear with a quarter to run, was
reengaged by the winner nearing midstretch, outkicked by that one to the wire. SPICE OF MY LIFE moved off the inside first turn, raced in mid pack, moved
closer while saving ground into the lane, proved no match for the top two the final furlong, clear of the others. ANGOLA VACATION broke back, lacked
speed, dropped inside far turn, steered back out turning into the straight, improved position with some belated interest. FLYING CAROLINA in the second
flight toward the inside, advanced and lodged a brief bid while three wide and between foes inside the runner up into the far turn, began to fade soon after.
EASY EDDIE A back off the pace while saving ground early, continued toward the inside in the run up the backstretch, came in the two path for the drive,
went one paced to the wire. LORD HELP ME last away, void of speed, continued well back through the second turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after
the issue had been decided. BOSS MAN ZONG broke on top, dueled up front along the inside, gave way into the far turn. FREE FALLING NATE fell back to
trail after the start, was always outrun. LAMONT settled in mid pack, stopped after five furlongs.

Footnotes
GEORGIA DAWN stalked the early leader in the three path, went after that rival far turn, bid entering the stretch, dueled to the wire, headed late, dug in late
to narrowly prevail in game fashion. J Z'S FIRST last to leave, trailed early while saving ground, angled out four wide when moving smartly late in the final
turn, collared the two leaders with a furlong to run, late duel, put a head in front in the waning strides then was outgamed at the wire. HARLANS WARRIOR
cleared soon after the start, set the pace while rating along the inside, continued to hold a daylight advantage second turn, briefly responded when the
winner challenged entering the stretch, caved late, saved the show late. HERE COMES LOVIE back off the pace, improved three wide into the stretch,
failed to sustain that advance through the lane, not enough late for the show. SIMPLE PLEASURE broke on top, quickly fell back, continued to lag up the
backstretch, improved position from between rivals while not a serious threat. LAKE RUNNER one paced throughout in lacking a closing response.
BEYOND D'ORO five wide through the first turn, continued wide up the backstretch, five wide again second turn, remained back. TAPIT'S LADY chased the
early leader, began a steady retreat after a half.

Footnotes
BROKEN PROPOSAL tracked the leader along the inside early, shuffled back along the rail late backstretch, moved out, raced three wide into the stretch,
closed with good resolve to be up in time while holding off the runner up. MSCHITCHATTOUR lacked speed for five furlongs, was four wide out of the final
turn, roused, coming late while widest through the lane. COINMAKER off a step slow, moved out, advanced to challenge on the outside late backstretch,
held a narrow advantage through the final turn and past the furlong marker, caught late. MADISON'S SCREEN within striking distance early, bid after a half,
dueled inside upper stretch, faltered late. IRON BANNER away well, was clear early in setting the pace, continued to show the way early backstretch, was
joined by a pair of foes just before a half, vied into the far turn closest to the inside and began to falter. BARBIE WARS fell back to trail after the start, always
outrun in showing little.

Footnotes
STORMY VALENTINE broke on top, clear before a furlong in hand, continued under restraint when maintaining daylight into the stretch, drew out through
the lane without being asked for her best. TONI'S M also away in good order, chased the winner in vain throughout, had little for that one through the lane,
clearly second best. CAROLINA JACY back off the pace outside, four wide through the turn when beginning to mount a mild rally, proved no match for the
top two, gained the nod for the show. NICELY UNIFIED went one paced off the inside, late bid for the show, missed. REQUITE THE EFFORT within striking
distance, gave way through the stretch. TOP CON settled in mid pack early, had little for the drive. SANDY AUSTIN shied from between horses to race
greenly early, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DOUBLE BARREL MAN fell back from between horses after the start, moved out widest into the turn,circled five to six wide into contention exiting the turn,
bid, drove clear. BUNKIE'S SONG back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, fell back in some traffic nearing the furlong marker, moved out a
bit, rallied and finished up willingly to garner the place. MUCHO MARVIN lacked speed, asked along while five wide and between horses turning into the
stretch, improved to be closest to the winner inside that one past the furlong marker, outkicked late for the place. WAR SONG in mid pack, bit closer into the
lane toward the inside, in tight then checked up with a furlong remaining, recovered and displayed some late interest to improve. TRIPPER JOHN close
early from the outside, dueled through the turn, weakened in the final furlong. CURTIN'S UP took command after the start, dueled up front closest to the
inside through the bend, also began to falter in midstretch. PERFECT PERIGEE last away, trailed most of the way, failed to menace. GRAND PRADO
forwardly placed early, was weakening when in traffic along the inside midstretch, trailed home.

Footnotes
DIAMOND DEAL bothered at the start to spot the field a couple of lengths, moved out widest and was six wide into the turn, advanced while five wide into
the lane, took over and drove well clear as much the best. REAL DEAL RYAN forwardly placed off the inside, continued to prompt the issue through the turn
three wide, lost some ground to the pacesetting runner up into the lane, caught that one late for the runner up position while no match for the winner.
BUCKSKIN JERRY took command after the start, set the pace along the inside for three furlongs, offered little resistance to the winner entering the lane,
caught late for the place. EMILYHASHERTURN forwardly placed, raced five wide into the turn and inside the winner, had little left for the stretch run.
BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY fell back to trail after the start, improved slightly without posing a serious threat. DARK SKYER broke out to bother the winner,
main body and four wide into the turn, faded. MISS JAN vied up front in the two path and between foes, gave way early in the turn, continued to fade
through the stretch.

Footnotes
MANGELSEN broke on top, showed the way out of the chute, rated kindly the middle half, extended his advantage into the stretch, enough left to hold the
runner up safe late while inside that one at the wire. PARROT HEAD settled off the pace while in a bit of traffic into the first turn, moved closer off the inside
after a half, came three wide for the drive, steadily getting to the winner late while well clear for the second spot. SNIVELING raced in mid pace, asked along
between horses far turn, swung out widest for the drive, staged a mild rally down the middle of the course to be along for the show. DREWPOWER tucked
inside onto the main course, continued to race unhurried, asked along second turn, split foes into the stretch, improved position. WHEN'S TEE TIME
forwardly placed out of the chute, chased the winner the middle half, had little left for the stretch drive. ONE TIME GEM prompted the winner early, fell back
to mid pack before a half, went evenly through the lane in lacking a rally. GET THEM JUSTIN four wide when off the pace into the first turn, failed to muster
a rally. EYE DEE KAY broke back and was never a threat. THUNDERSHOOK last to leave, fell further and further back, distanced, jogged in.

Footnotes
AUTUMNS STRONG MAN broke with leaders, headed up second flight early off the inside, closer three wide turn, roused turning for home, reeled in leader
under steady handling, edged clear late. SCOOTERIA asked along early to maintain inside position, dueled into the turn, shook clear, extended that
advantage into the stretch, could not contain the winner while holding sway for the place. DREWMAZING void of speed early, continued to lag well back
through the turn, three wide entering the stretch, roused, late run to be going best of all at the end. SONO broke on top, dueled outside the runner up in the
run up the backstretch, chased that one through the turn and into the lane, gradually weakened through the lane. MOR BIG LEE well back off the early
pace, dropped to the inside through the turn, came up empty for the drive. TAMBOURINE STAR in the second flight while four wide into the turn, backed up
in the drive.

much the best. ASTERN BANKER in mid pack while toward the inside up the backstretch, waited behind traffic late in the turn, shifted out for room when
straightened for home, rallied to be clear for the place, no threat to the winner. MIDNIGHT CROWN broke well, pressed the issue early while between
horses, vied between rivals through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, caught late for the place. COLE'S SENSATION broke back, roused
in the five path into the lane, improved position through some traffic. STRAY CAT STRUT within striking distance, vied five through the turn and inside the
winner, weakened in the drive. SACRED NATION last to leave, well back for a half while saving ground, moved out, passed tiring rivals while not a serious
threat. ASTROLOGY WONOWON raced with the early pace, vied between rivals through the turn, gave way in the drive. TRUVY'S BANDIT forwardly
placed well off the inside, with the pace four wide and between horses turn, tired through the stretch. VERDUNVILLE broke back, never menaced. UNCLE
CHAN forwardly placed in the early going off the rail, faded. GLITTER STORM flashed early foot along the inside, stopped turning for home, well back.
