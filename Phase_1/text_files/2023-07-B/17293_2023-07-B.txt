Footnotes
FLAWLESS BOURBON tracked three deep through the first turn, tacked to the rail on the backstretch, slipped through and forged command after a half,
shook clear on the second turn and held sway under steady urging. AULT attended the pace along the inside, shifted out leaving the quarter pole to launch
her bid, kicked on well but was unable to reach the winner. SPETTACOLI (ARG) tucked in to save ground on the first turn, got through every step and
churned on to earn the minor award. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS contested the pace off of the inside, relinquished the lead after a half, stayed on to the final
furlong and faded. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL was allowed to settle, came under a ride on the second turn, came four wide and finished with a belated
improvement. KING OF THE RING failed to respond. BOOMIN GOOSE vied for the lead three wide to the second turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
WON SMALL WARRIOR settled off of the inside, ranged into striking distance through the turn, wheeled out to continue the advance entering the stretch,
wore down KOTYLOS inside the furlong marker and kicked away. KOTYLOS tracked in hand outside, launched a bold bid four wide, forged command
entering the stretch, kept on but was unable to resist the winner. NATURE TRAIL chased three deep, came to level terms between rivals nearing the quarter
pole, but flattened in the drive and gave way. GRUIT was slow into stride, dropped well back and was never a factor. LUMI contended off of the inside to the
stretch and tired. CHIEF CRAZY MOON sped clear to set the pace, was collared leaving the turn and gave way readily once headed.

RUNAWAY HARRY opened clear to dictate terms, turned back all challengers leaving the second turn, widened into the stretch and held safely. DIGITAL
FOOTPRINT settled saving ground, ranged into position nearing the quarter pole, got through but was unable to reach the winner. GREG'S HONOR
contended between rivals, angled out leaving the second turn, loomed five wide but failed to sustain the attack. QUARTERMASTER was unhurried into
stride, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, moved up off of the inside, got through and improved position. CREATIVE CHOICE stalked the pace,
bid between horses, but weakened leaving the second turn and gave way. NIGHT TIME RULER bobbled at the start, moved into contention four wide,
stayed on through the second turn and dropped out. ADIOS BOBBY was forwardly placed between horses to the second turn and retreated.

Footnotes
UPTOWN CHARLOTTE stalked the pace three deep, reeled in JAZZ TIME GIRL inside the sixteenth, shook clear and held. I'M HEADING EAST settled
inside, pulled to contention, waited in traffic, wheeled out leaving the turn, quickened once uncovered but found her best stride too late. JAZZ TIME GIRL
sped clear to set the pace, settled into the drive well clear, but faltered in the final sixteenth and gave way. LT. LYDIA stalked the pace three deep, was
within striking distance to the final furlong but lacked the needed late response. GIO'S MY DAD contended between foes three wide, but failed to respond
when called upon. CHICKEN TALK was hustled along four wide in mid pack but failed to make headway. BROKEN LOVE broke slow and was never a
factor. EMALTHA steadied early, was forwardly placed inside through the turn and dropped out. WIFEY MATERIAL hopped at the start, was fanned wide on
the turn and showed little.

Footnotes
I ONCE STOOD ALONE attended the pace off of the inside, shifted out to commence his attack inside the three-sixteenths pole, kicked clear and held safe.
VOORHEES was unhurried into stride, settled saving ground, got through and finished with a rush but was left with too much to do. SPAN OF CONTROL
came away a step slow, settled toward the inside, came under a ride with three furlongs to run, angled out and kicked on well to earn the minor award.
SPIRITED DEBATE opened clear to set the pace, but came up empty inside the furlong marker and gave in. ASPLUNDER was allowed to settle, looped
into the stretch four wide and finished with a belated improvement. CALL ME PEAK broke slow, moved into contention four wide, but came up empty in the
drive and dropped out. VELOCIMO chased three wide through the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
POKER PARTNER was away alertly, opened clear to set the pace off of the inside and gamely led throughout. UNCLE KENNY attended the pace along the
inside, got through and finished willingly to clearly prove the best of the rest. HECTOR chased three wide, weakened during the drive but had enough to
preserve the show. FACE DOWN stalked the pace, came four wide to make his bid, but flattened in the drive. GAMBOLING GHOST was forwardly placed
between horses, dropped back a bit on the turn, came three wide and went evenly thereafter. KEY WEST O'KATIE was allowed to settle, came four wide
but failed to make headway. EMPTY MY POUCH settled off of the inside and lacked a response when asked. SO CLOSE SO FAR was allowed to settle,
angled in on the turn, but failed to respond. TALE OF THE DRAGON broke slow, dropped well back and never recovered. PER HORSE RACING
INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, POKER PARTNER WAS DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

SHE'S REDNECKER angled in and controlled the tempo along the rail, shook off RITAAN midway through the turn, rebuffed the bid of ZIP CODE ENVY
into the lane, and kicked away to score with authority. ZIP CODE ENVY tracked along the inside, ranged up to engage the dogged SHE'S REDNECKER
leaving the turn, was unable to go on with that one in the drive and settled for the runner up spot. RITAAN prompted the pace outside for a half and dropped
out.

Footnotes
GIACOMETTI set the pace from the outset, was in the two path into the lane, remained clear near the eighth pole then drew away late in the stretch under a
steady drive. CROWLEY'S WAR stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane, made a bid in the stretch but was no match for the winner late in
the stretch run. ROWDY JESS was a tad slow at the start and trailed the field early on, raced in the four path into the lane and rallied for show. GOLDEN
OAK raced back early on, was in the four path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. SILVER TOKEN raced back early on, was in the four path into
the lane and improved position. GYPSY KITTEN was a tad slow at the start, raced in the five path into the lane and improved position down the lane.
THOUSAND LOVES chased the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. SMARTY JOHN was through after a half.
PUNX was steadied nearing the three eighths pole from the inside and empty thereafter.
