Footnotes
LOVE MY CHERYL was in touch, a factor on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. HEADING WEST was unhurried early,
had to check into the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch finished well. MAKES SENSE TO ME tracked the early leaders from the outside
and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch needed more. DEVIL IN HER HEART was up close and had a clear lead on the
turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and had nothing left. MIMI'S HOLIDAY was off slow and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat.
WHATSWRONGWITHYOU was away alertly but lost ground on the turn, was outdistanced and walked off.

KHOZZY VALINTINE broke poorly, moved up on the turn and with a bid from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. MORE
SAVVY was hustled early, had the lead on the turn and vied through the stretch in a good effort. TRISH THE DISH was in range but trailed the field on the
turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch was up for show. FANCYSOUL broke outward and was roused on the turn but from the four path at the
top of the stretch was no threat. GLITTER BAY was away alertly and a factor on the turn but dropped back through the stretch.

UNBRIDLED INFERNO was unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew clear. MISS D'S PRIDE
stalked the early leader, was a factor on the far turn and had the lead from the three path in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. LADY OF THE
FORT was in touch and raced evenly on the far turn but needed more. THIS CAT IS BY JAX was off the pace, had a mild gain on the far turn and was up for
a share. AMEN TO THAT was in mid pack and had a good position on the far turn but had no late kick. WIN THE DRAW was well back and trailed the field
on the far turn but passed tired foes through the stretch. BROADWAY RUCKUS was in range and roused on the far turn but from the four path at the top of
the stretch had no response. PRINCE FOR A DAY set the pace and had a clear lead on the far turn but dropped back through the stretch. FIRST ROUND
had no speed and showed little in a dull effort.

Footnotes
ERNIE'S MARTINI tracked the early leaders from the inside, was a factor on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was kept to task. EIN
WAHRER SOLDAT was unhurried early, had a mild gain on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was up for place. AUTUMN'S SO
FLASHY was in mid pack and moved up on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. I LIVE BY FAITH set the pace and had the
lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was off the pace and saved ground on the turn but was no
real threat. WIKWEMIKONG GHOST was well back, trailed the field on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch was not a factor. TAYBO
stalked the early leaders from the outside but chased on the turn and had no impact. BUSTA GROOVE was in touch and had a good position on the turn but
from the six path at the top of the stretch was empty.

SILENT GUROO set the pace, had the lead on the far turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. BORN TO BE GOOD was in range, moved
up on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch finished well. PLUIE D'AVRIL was unhurried early and a factor on the far turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch was all out. FRESH DREAMS was in touch, raced evenly on the far turn and was up for a share. HASN'T HIT ME YET
was in mid pack and hustled along on the far turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. MUSICAL RIDE stalked the early leader but
chased on the far turn and weakened. MONASTERY LANE was off the pace and saved ground on the far turn but failed to fire. LOOKIN TO FLY was well
back, showed nothing and was never in contention. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER ON PLUIE D'AVRIL AGAINST SILENT GUROO FOR ALLEGED

Footnotes
CRUMLIN BIRD was in touch, had a good inside position on the turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch proved best. BABY MO was in range, a
factor on the turn and had the lead from the three path in mid stretch but was outfinished. NEW YORK MINT settled off the pace, had a mild gain on the turn
and was up for show. SHANGHAI KIMMY was in mid pack and raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was all out. MS. P'S
BELLA was off the pace and hustled along on the turn but had no late kick. SWEET FINALE was unhurried early and saved ground on the turn but had no
impact. EASY ACCESS was hustled early and had the lead on the turn but was headed in mid stretch and faded. SAVVY'S SISTER was well back, trailed
the field on the turn and was not a factor. ALLABOUTTHEDRAMA was up close but lost ground on the turn and was empty.
