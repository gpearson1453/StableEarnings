Footnotes
L'IMPERATOR (FR) moved in after clearing fence one at the rear of the field, jumped well off the pace, rallied on the final turn, closed well to overtake the
tired leader in upper stretch and drew away under good handling. BEAT LE BON (FR) sped clear soon after the flag-fall, jumped reasonably well while
opening up a huge advantage, shortened stride on the final turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and weakened but was well clear for the
place. HOFFMAN (IRE) jostled with a foe over fence two, followed the runaway leader from second, was urged along after fence seven, dropped back on
the final turn and had nothing left while best of the rest. MODUS OPERANDI (IRE) jumped awkwardly over fence, leapt outward at multiple fences well while
off the pace, dropped back under urging on the final turn and lacked the needed response. MR. CONNECTICUT jostled with a rival over fence two, settled
outside in the three path and failed to respond. SALVINO (IRE) stumbled landing over fence one, left the course after fence three then was vanned off.

Footnotes
LAFITTE'S FLEET coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch, took over command inside the eighth pole and edged clear in the late stages to prevail. RAM coaxed from the gate, chased inside early on until
tipped to the three path five furlongs from home, advanced on the leader from the outside tucking to the two path through the turn and coming under coaxing
at the five-sixteenths now heads apart for command, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting herded slightly out to the eighth pole
and then came inwards and was bumped by JAKE ROCKS inside that station as this top pair was displaced by the eventual winner, ran on to prevail in the
battle for the place honors. JAKE ROCKS coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand from the two path down the backstretch, tucked inside into the turn
and came under increased pressure from the aforementioned foe and was placed to coaxing in response at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper
stretch, came out slightly straightened away and then got directed inwards at the eventual winner as he went on by just inside the eighth pole, bumped with
RAM at that juncture and ran on to the finish but was ultimately bested for the show honors by a nostril on the wire. FLINT RIDGE chased four then three
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. BEAVER HAT chased five wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired. SILK TRADE chased four wide down the backstretch and through the turn getting lightly
engaged by the rider from the five-sixteenths into upper stretch, failed to respond and went six wide into upper stretch, then got eased home through to the
finish.

Footnotes
GRAM was well placed towards the front under coaxing, came under stronger encouragement while asked to move up outside the half-mile pole, steadied
outside the seven-sixteenths then dropped back into the turn, saved ground on that bend, steadied again outside the quarter-pole, was roused three wide
into the stretch then quickly shifted to the five path, rallied outside to get the lead inside the furlong marker, fought outside of the runner-up to the finish and
prevailed under strong urging. HEAVENLY GIRL was hustled from the gate, moved in while establishing a good position just off the pace, chased two then
three wide on the turn, gained four wide into the stretch then made a bid, led under a drive into the final furlong then lost the advantage to the winner, fought
on to the finish but missed while clear for the place. BAREFOOT DISCO settled towards the rear, was taken in hand when a foe crossed in front near the
nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, moved out while gaining under a drive in upper stretch, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and
safely secured the show. FOLLOW YOUR ARROW came away in good order and went straight to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, was
asked along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. BEING BETTY was bumped while off
a bit slow then checked, shied out badly and was taken up significantly early, spotted the front many lengths, raced at the rear, went three wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and improved position. MEL'S ANGEL was bumped at the start then forced into another foe and taken up, dropped towards
the rear, moved out around the nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch then moved out, chased outside
into the final furlong and tired. INCA MUMMY pressed the pace on the outside under urging, vied in the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and capitulated. NEEDED broke a half-step slow, moved up to track the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, fought under a
drive in upper stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and also tired. SARATOGA SMOKESHOW broke a step slow, was ridden along on the outside,
went around the turn in the two path and was no factor. LOVE THYSELF broke out and bumped with a foe then shied in shortly thereafter, ducked in sharply
early then hit the temporary rail and unseated the rider then was walked off after being caught by an outrider.

Footnotes
ECHO ZULU coaxed from the gate, showed the way from the two path down the backstretch under pressure from FRANK'S ROCKETTE to the outside,
tucked inside at the half mile pole and remained inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch,
floated two then three wide straightened away while going clear under a light drive, got taken in hand and was geared down through the final sixteenth to the
finish to prevail comfortably at the end. DR B broke on top and was quickly relegated to third chasing four wide down the backstretch, tucked three wide
through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to
secure the place honors clear of the rest. FRANK'S ROCKETTE broke out a step brushing the off side stall at the start, came under coaxing and pressed
the pace of ECHO ZULU from the outside three then two wide into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside at the quarter
pole before floating to the four path straightened away, dug in shaken off and weakened to the finish. MARYQUITECONTRARY bobbled at the start and
was away last, chased four wide coming under prolonged coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped five wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
RELATE was hustled from the gate, angled in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside, shook clear with three furlongs to run, responded well
when set down in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop inside the furlong marker and held under steady urging. QUALITY G was fractious in the
gate then flipped before quickly righting himself, was backed out then deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came away in good order, was well placed
just off the pace on the inside, shifted to the two path coming to the quarter-pole, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished with good
courage to safely secure the place. ST. JOE LOUIS (GB) broke in then moved in while taken in hand early, was rated under a snug hold in the two path
between foes, shifted three wide while roused at the quarter-pole then drifted further out before being straightened by the rider, pursued the top two in the
stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES angled in towards the rear, saved ground while unhurried towards the
back, was roused after turning into the stretch, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and improved position. ENDOWED broke out and bumped with a foe,
settled on the inside, was urged along on the far turn and lacked the needed response. DON'T LET ME DOWN tossed his head while rank under tight
restraint nearing the first turn, went three wide under a strong hold on that bend, was reserved off the pace, came under urging late on the backstretch, went
three wide on the far turn and failed to rally. ADDICTED TO YOU was restless in the gate, became keen under restraint nearing the first turn, went three
wide on that bend, settled towards the back, traveled two then three wide on the far turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole, moved out in upper stretch
and failed to threaten. MAMA BANNED ME bumped with an opponent at the start while last to commence, was urged early, went three wide on the turns,
came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MOON WATCH (IRE) bumped with a rival at the start then had his path taken, rounded the opening bend
in the four path, was rated outside without the benefit of cover, traveled three then four wide on the far turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated.
LIL BRO COOP was bumped at the start and forced in, went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, chased two to three wide on the
far turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
ICHIBAN raced along the inside through the first turn before chasing two to three wide down the backstretch, went three then four wide through the far turn
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, tipped six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive getting on track nearing the sixteenth marker as the
leader began to shorten stride and surged home to just get up in the shadow of the wire and score. APRIL ANTICS coaxed from the gate, raced two then
three wide through the first turn, chased four then three wide advancing into the far turn, steadily gained outside the duel while in hand to take over the front
nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone
threat and shortened stride inside the final sixteenth growing leg weary under challenge and was nailed on the wire. ATHENA BEACH coaxed from the gate,
dueled from the two path with DANSEUR D'ORO to her outside, tucked inside into the far turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, clung to
command from the her main pace rival when overtaken as a tandem nearing the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to
preserve the show honors. DUCKPHAT saved ground at the tail of the field, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide at the
quarter pole, then tipped out to be six to seven wide straightened away and kicked on belatedly to miss for the show honors. SHESASCOLDASICE just off
the inside through the opening bend, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing
with seven-sixteenths remaining, cut the corner into upper stretch and offered no kick. DANSEUR D'ORO stumbled at the start, dueled three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got overthrown in concert with her main pace rival near the quarter pole and went five wide into upper stretch,
then tired in the drive. BIG HAZEL bobbled at the break, race four wide through the first turn and then gave chase four to five wide down the backstretch and
through the far turn under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
OUR SHOT brushed with a rival at the start then was hustled, disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, was eased back off the pace leaving the
backstretch, shifted to the two path near the five-sixteenths, gained to make a three wide bid at the quarter-pole, was asked for his best in upper stretch,
battled gamely between horses in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong handling. ARREST ME RED stalked the pace on the outside then in
the three path on the turn, made a bid while asked in the four path at the quarter-pole, fought with multiple foes in the stretch and just missed while narrowly
able to get the place. BRING ME A CHECK broke out at the start, was well placed just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was given his cue
near the quarter-pole, dropped in behind horses in upper stretch, chased along the rail into the final furlong, gained to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole,
fought with the top two to the finish and just missed while able to get the show. OUTLAW KID settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked four wide
on the turn, made a five wide bid into the stretch, fought outside of the top three wide into the final sixteenth and was outfinished. THIN WHITE DUKE was
hustled from the gate, settled under some urging, was roused three wide on the turn then driven four wide into the stretch, moved out while chasing the
leaders in the final furlong and finished willingly to just miss the superfecta. COPPOLA disputed the pace on the outside, moved to a solo advantage leaving
the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole then spun into the stretch in the two path, battled with
several foes under a drive into the final furlong, was grabbed with the left-rein while coming out slightly around the sixteenth-pole and was out-kicked.
ARZAK brushed with a rival at the start then was taken up, settled at the rear, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch then angled
further out and gained but missed the superfecta. CHEWING GUM settled on the outside towards the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, was
driven three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MAXWELL ESQUIRE was hustled from the gate, settled on the inside of a foe towards the rear,
saved ground on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
AMANDA'S FOLLY established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under attendance and facing some pressure from EROS'S GIRL to
the outside, had the runner up advance outside that foe midway on the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths in response, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive drifting out four paths through to the sixteenth marker, got corrected inside that station and held game head
cocked to the infield to the wire. SWEET MYSTERY broke out trading a bump at the start with B B'S BUSTED, who broke inwards, raced three wide through
the first turn before chasing four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn advancing on the top pair three furlongs from home, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the aforementioned foe through the final furlong and
fought on to the end but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. OK HONEY chased just off the inside briefly tucking inside at the half mile pole before tipping
back to the two path when placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and drifted an additional path or two in
tandem with a pair rivals and improved position to secure the show honors. EROS'S GIRL attended the leader from the outside in the three path, began to
apply pressure to that rival into the far turn and upped the ante three furlongs out when placed to coaxing, angled five wide into upper stretch in the midst of
being shaken off, drifted out with two rivals straightened away and weakened to the finish. B B'S BUSTED broke in at the start trading a bump with SWEET
MYSTERY, raced four wide into the first turn before tucking to the two path soon after, chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and drifted out straightened away in concert with a pair of foes and weakened.

Footnotes
INDIAN MISCHIEF crossed to the inside steadily after the start to be in the two path into the first turn latching on VINCE THE PRINCE to the outside
through that bend, knocked heads in hand dueling down the backstretch and into the far turn with that rival coming under coaxing near the quarter pole and
taking command straightened away, came under a left handed crop and drifted out two paths directly in front and impeding HE'S A LUCKY GUY forcing that
foe to check just off his heels sharp enough to displace large chunks of the sod in a halt while brushing that foe with his hindquarters, inched away under a
drive now with some breathing room and drifted in under a right handed crop to the rail while holding safe to the finish kept to task. HE'S A LUCKY GUY
coaxed from the gate, tracked the duel along the inside from a loose pocket, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out and swung three wide into
upper stretch advancing on the top pair, had INDIAN MISCHIEF come out under a left handed crop just when latching on VINCE THE PRINCE and was
forced to check directly off the heels of INDIAN MISCHIEF, her two front legs passing to either side of the rear left leg of INDIAN MISCHIEF before
displacing some sod when checked and brushing with the hindquarters of that rival, lost two lengths of momentum as a result and came under renewed
encouragement to get going once more and showed good courage to keep on for the place honors while never recovering the full flight she had to the
furlong grounds prior to the incident. VINCE THE PRINCE got bumped askew at the start by ENGLISH STORM, who broke inwards, established the front
shortly after the start along the rail into the first turn and got latched on by the eventual winner to the outside, dueled in hand along the inside down the
backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing under threat with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch under challenge
and was headed straightened away, dug in under a drive latched on to the eighth pole, then ran on to preserve the show honors by a neck on the wire.
CONQUIST broke out at the start bumping WAYWARD GHOST in tandem with SHARP PLAY BOY, settled two then three wide just off the duel coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on to just secure the last major share. ENGLISH STORM broke in at the start
bumping VINCE THE PRINCE and knocking him briefly sideways, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and improved position to finish offering up a belated bid. YOUR MISSION two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid but was out-finished. AULA tracked the pace along the inside coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and made no headway through to the finish. WAFLR four paths off
the inside past the stands the initial time, tucked three wide with seven and a half furlongs to run directly in front and impeding CONTROL ALT DELETE and
forcing that foe to clip heels before he could check and alter out, settled just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered no response. SHARP PLAY BOY broke in at the start bumping WAYWARD GHOST in concert with
CONQUIST, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and
tired. DRUID chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. WAYWARD
GHOST got bumped between foes at the start who each broke his way, was near the rear of the field four wide moving into the first turn when CONTROL
ALT DELETE was impeded just to his inside and clipped the back of the guilty party WAFLR, had that foe recover outwards bobbling and got carried out to
the six path before allowing that foe to clear and making a darting tuck to the two path, lost ground and momentum and joined CONTROL ALT DELETE
detached as a pair well behind the rest of the field, chased just off the inside from that point on into upper stretch while eased home to the finish having lost
all chance. CONTROL ALT DELETE settled three wide near the rear into the first turn, had WAFLR tuck directly in front from the outside and was checked
and attempted to alter out but clipped the back of that rival's heels bobbling heavily and recovering outwards carrying out WAYWARD GHOST with him,
remained out six paths until tucked steadily back to the three path into the backstretch now well behind the rest of the field with the exception of the lone
rival caught outside him, chased three wide, went three to four wide for home while eased through to the finish having lost all chance early on. There was a
Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run focusing on the incident at the eighth pole between INDIAN MISCHIEF and HE'S A LUCKY GUY. After review, the
result was allowed to stand and the race was declared official.
