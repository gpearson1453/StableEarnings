Footnotes
GRANITIANSEVENSIX got put in tight between rivals early then moved back into range from inside, drew closer along the rail then two wide late on the
turn, drew alongside BELMONT BILL with a sixteenth to go and got up nearing the wire. BELMONT BILL set the pace under pressure early, cleared on the
turn, met the challenge from the winner at the sixteenth pole but could not hold on. NEON LIGHTS (IRE) chased three deep into the turn, remained three
wide to the stretch, steered out in the lane and edged MIDNIGHT FURY for the show honors. MIDNIGHT FURY pressed from outside, chased the leader
two to three wide outside a rival around the bend, could not re-rally in the drive and lost the show. RAHM shifted in to bumped rival at the start, lacked room
behind foe from the three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths pole, cut the corner into the lane and kept on while unable to threaten. PLAYER B was off slow
from outside, raced at the back outside a rival to the turn, went two to three wide around the bend, angled out and could not rally. POP POP'S RIDE broke
slow and got bumped back at the start, puled the rider along up the backstretch, traveled along the fence then went between rivals late on the bend, angled
out at the top of the lane and failed to menace. CAPTAIN SPARROW away quicky then chased the top pair to the turn, entered the lane two wide and
weakened. MOBE TOWN raced in range early then off the pace, went three to four wide wide around the bend and weakened.

Footnotes
TAMBO raced up close from outside early, bid two wide into the turn, vied three deep at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, dueled through the final
furlong and gamely prevailed. DESERT RHAPSODY forwardly placed between early then got put in a bit tight to lose ground into the turn, came again and
challenged four deep with a quarter mile remaining, dueled outside TAMBO down the lane and was denied. ASIAN MATRIARCH was reluctant to load into
the gate, stalked from inside into the turn, launched a rail bid at the quarter pole but got outkicked by the top pair in the final furlong. CARALOVA took
control early, pressured by TAMBO into the turn, vied along the rail then between rivals leaving the bend, was overtaken in upper stretch and weakened.
SUPER ENTICING chased while climbing a bit early, rounded the bend two to three wide and lacked a rally. SAKURA BLOSSOM steadied behind ASIAN
MATRIARCH early then climbed and was guided out, went four then five wide around the turn and failed to menace. UNION HEIRESS climbed early while
dropping back under coaxing, took the turn two to three wide and could not make an impact. SELDOVIA chased three wide into the turn, five wide into the
stretch and weakened.

NINEELEVENTURBO stalked the pace along the rail, tipped out around the final turn and took aim three wide into the stretch, launched a bid and bumped
with inner rival at the three-sixteenths pole, quickly cleared after and drew away under hand urging and coasted in near the wire. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT
chased three wide into the first turn then dropped back to tuck inside, coaxed along leaving the backstretch inching closer, swung out leaving the far turn
and finished determinedly but had to settle for second best. SEVEN WONDERS dueled for the lead around the first turn then ceded command, closest in
pursuit from the two path in the early, moved up to duel again from outside on the final bend, bumped while taking over at the top of the lane, relinquished
the lead shortly after, flattened late but managed to hold the show. KINGMEISTER antsy in the gate, got put in a bit tight early, reserved in the two path
after, got blocked at the five-sixteenths pole then again at the quarter pole, angled in around the far turn, steered out in the lane and churned on for a minor
award. COWBOY JUSTICE (GB) dueled around the first turn from the rail, cleared first time in the stretch, dueled around the final bend, lost the advantage
into the lane and weakened. RIJEKA (IRE) got put in tight early then settled inside, moved closer between rivals up the backstretch, raced three deep into
the far turn, stayed off the rail to the stretch and weakened. SEVENTEEN BLACK rated three then two wide early, moved out three then four deep on the

Footnotes
SIGNORA MINISTER stalked outside a rival into the turn, challenged for command at the quarter pole, kicked clear exiting the bend and powered away
under right handed urging and steady handling late. EVERLYS GIRL chased between rivals two wide into the turn, moved out and came four wide into the
lane and bested the rest. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE got bumped from outside early, forwardly placed two wide into the turn, chased three wide into the
lane, flattened in the furlong grounds but held the show. NEVER SWAY raced in range three deep into the turn, lost ground around the bend, came five wide
into the stretch, kept on to earn a minor award but never threatened. LOV U MEAN IT tugged when trying to be reserved at the back early, raced along the
inside then angled five wide around the bend and improved position. CARELESS STAR cleared from outside then crossed over, led along the rail then
received a challenge from SIGNORA MINISTER at the quarter pole, failed to offer any resistance and gave way in the stretch run. THE REIGN SONG
chased three deep into the turn at the back, spun four wide into the lane and came up empty. TEN THE SMART WAY bobbled to the front at the start, took
a tracking position inside, saved ground to the lane, tipped out and weakened. QUEENIES WAY drifted in to bump rival then checked early and dropped
back, raced two wide into the turn, a bit off the rail into the drive and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
ANDY CAN U HEAR ME dueled for the lead from outside, took over leaving the far turn, put away GRAZED in the final sixteenth and held over the
runner-up. DARK MARCUS settled inside then checked two wide on the clubhouse turn, moved closer between up the backstretch, got boxed in from the
three-eighths pole to the five-sixteenths marker, found room and went between rivals around that bend, finished well through the lane but was too late.
GRAZED dueled for command from inside, lost the advantage leaving the far turn, fought to the sixteenth pole and faltered late. MAXVILLE hit the gate and
came away slow, trailed early on, angled six wide around the far turn, rallied widest in the lane but could not get up for third. SILENT HEAT pulled and had
to steady behind the leader on the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, tipped out on the far turn and took aim three wide into the lane but failed to produce
a bid. LUKA GRAZIE got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, had to steady behind DARK MARCUS on the first turn, raced near the back into the
second bend, paused at the five-sixteenths pole behind foes then angled inside, tipped out in the lane, looked to rally but lacked room in deep stretch.
MOON ICE bumped outer rival at the start, reserved along the rail early, gained around the far turn continuing along the fence and faltered in the furlong
grounds. PANTHERA'S FATE broke a step slow and got bumped leaving the gate, pulled and became rank in the early going and fought the rider all the
way to the half-mile pole, came five wide into the lane and could not rally. CHIPPEWA BUD was off slow in the beginning, traveled two to three wide around
both turns and also lacked a rally. EL REY DORADO pulled between rivals early, continued between into the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and
weakened. GRANNY'S IPA stalked along the three path early, started to weaken on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive.

HOME COOKING pressed from outside early, took over at the five-sixteenths pole then cleared inner rival and drew off under urging. POWER SURGE
forwardly placed outside rivals early, entered the stretch three to four wide, could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner but stayed on to
secure second. COFFEE IN BED stumbled slightly, chased off the pace off the inside, rounded the bend four to five wide and summoned a mild rally.
HALFWAY TO NOWHERE broke a bit slow and bumped in the beginning, moved into range outside rivals, took the turn three then four wide, drifted inward
in the lane and flattened. VITALERA (CHI) chased two wide into the turn, had the rider lose his whip around the bend, spun three wide into the lane and
lacked the needed response. CLIQUISH sat off the pace on the inside and failed to respond in the lane. FLYMETOTHEMOONBABY was off slow from
outside, trailed up the backstretch, steered to the inside and saved ground through the turn, found traffic behind a rival in upper stretch, tipped out and
improved position. PEQUENA TORMENTA brushed at the start the bumped with outer rival early, climbed in mid-pack, went three wide into the turn, five
wide into the lane and failed to menace. SOUL OF A WARRIOR chased along the inside into the turn, moved out to the three path around the bend and
failed to rally. FULTON MARKET raced two wide near the back into the turn, remained along the two path to the stretch and made no impact. KO OLINA
bobbled leaving the gate then recovered to head for the front and set the pace up the backstretch under pressure, overtaken by the winner at the
five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
AMY C (GB) was off slow and brushed leaving the gate, steered down to the inside, had to pause running up behind a rival into the turn, shifted to the two
path around the bend, steered out in upper stretch, closed in entering the final sixteenth and bested TONY ANN late. TONY ANN sat off the pace early on,
gained two wide between rivals around the bend, rallied inside the leader in deep stretch but got outclosed by the winner. PRINCESS ADALEIGH pressed
the pace from outside early, failed to stay with the leader and chased while two, three, then four wide around the bend, came again entering the final
sixteenth but was outkicked. SASSY NATURE set the pace under pressure from PRINCESS ADALEIGH early, cleared that rival on the turn, drifted three
wide around the bend, remained clear into the final furlong, challenged by rivals on both sides with a sixteenth remaining and weakened after being
overtaken. UNBRIDLED MARY chased from off the pace two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend, summoned a mild rally but needed to
find more late. WIDE WEST (IRE) stalked the pace from inside into the turn, moved out at the top of the lane, came back in to bother rival past the eighth
pole and flattened in deep stretch. TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) settled inside, lacked room when boxed on the turn, gained an opening at the top of the
stretch, looked to rally but was impeded by WIDE WEST (IRE) and had to take up, then could not regain momentum after. XMAS SURPRISE broke a step
slow and brushed with inner rival, trailed on the inside then in the two path, moved out in the lane and failed to make an impact. SECRETS TOLD chased
three wide and weakened down the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED WIDE WEST (IRE) FROM SIXTH TO SEVENTH
FOR CROSSING OVER AND TAKING THE PATH OF TWILIGHT GLEAMING (IRE) NEAR THE EIGHTH POLE, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A
BETTER PLACING.
