Footnotes
FARRAH FOWLER broke in at the start and came away near the back then steadily edged up closer along the rail, tracked the embattled trio into the turn,
moved up to engage HAPPY STROLL near the quarter pole, got carried out by rival entering the lane, dueled for the lead to the furlong marker then gained
the advantage and kicked clear. HAPPY STROLL dueled three wide up the backstretch, began to edge away on top then took on the challenge from
FARRAH FOWLER near the quarter pole, drifted wider into the stretch, dueled for command to the eighth pole then got collared for the lead and had to
settle for second best. SMACKIN GOOD TIME dueled inside verse a duo up the backstretch, could not match strides late on the turn, saved ground entering
the lane and churned on for a share. GOOD N LUCKY dueled between rivals up the backstretch, could not move on for the lead late on the turn and steadily
faded in the lane. BLITZED rated off the top trio racing two wide, hustled along three to four wide around the turn but failed to respond and steadily
retreated. LARNED raced in the back along the outside and never moved into contention.

DAMASCUS GATE sprinted out to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, held clear around the turn, cut the corner entering the lane and
roused for more, responded willingly, pulled away and finished ridden out in the final sixteenth. BUG A BOO was allowed to settle out of the gate and
continued well reserved up the backstretch, edged closer late on the turn then given cue three to four wide entering the stretch run, dug in under firm
handling and captured place. RAISIN RAISIN tracked the leader along the inside in early stages, hustled up along the rail on the turn, tipped two wide for
the drive, stayed on, got edged for place and just lasted for show. BYE LOVE GOTTA GO raced in range along the outside, moved up closer three paths
wide late on the turn, was no match for pulling away winner but ran on then flattened and got edged for runner up spots. PEGGY RULES came away in
good order and raced up close two wide up then backstretch, flattened a bit between foes near the quarter pole, shifted to the inside at the head of the lane,
kept under right handed pressure in upper stretch but came up empty and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SWEET LAURA was off slow at the start and raced in the back through the opening quarter, edged a bit closer three wide around the turn, came under a
drive two wide in upper stretch, steadily edged up closer then surged in final stages and got up approaching the wire. SIERRA SUMMER hustled up the
inside and took over command mid-way up the backstretch, held firm and saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, widened to a clear
advantage heading toward the furlong marker, continued to lead the way into final stages then got caught in closing strides. GO GO GO tracked the pace
running through the backstretch, moved up closer three wide at the quarter pole, sustained outside bid in the lane, steadily gained ground, raced in striking
distance nearing the wire and lacked the needed surge to get by. MY DAMS ATITUDE rated off the early pace, hustled along four wide around the turn,
showed response in the final furlong and improved. NORTHERN GEM raced off the clear top trio in the opening quarter, hustled up along the rail on the
turn, briefly moved up closer then faded. DOLLY DIMPLE was forwardly placed through early stages and came up empty late on the turn.

WESTERN TOURIST vied for the lead in early stages the shook free and led the way around the turn, saved ground entering the lane, held clear a furlong
out, took on the challenge of MEDIA MOGUL in deep stretch, dug in and held safe. MEDIA MOGUL raced in range between foes in early stages, made a
three to four wide move leaving the turn, moved up to challenge WESTERM TOURIST for the lead in deep stretch but lacked the needed kick to get by.
WAR RASCAL tracked the pace into the turn, traced in striking distance three paths wide near the five sixteenths pole, flattened off the eventual winner in
the lane and kept on for a share. OUTOFQUEMADO raced in early contention along the inside, coaxed along the rail around the turn then weakened in the
lane. BRAHMS IMAGE vied for the lead in opening stages then remained forwardly placed around the turn, could not sustain bid turning for home and gave
way. SMACKZILLA was not too far back in early stages then lost ground near the half and continued to tire in the drive. C P THREE saved ground and
failed to move into contention.

ULTIMATE was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated off the embattled trio up the backstretch, picked up the tempo late on the turn, swung four paths
wide into the lane, responded willingly when called upon, took command from DIAMOND RIM in the final furlong and finished going away. DIAMOND RIM
dueled three deep for the lead up the backstretch and continued to battle into the lane, began to edge away on top a furlong out, fought back briefly when
challenged by ULTIMATE but could not move on with rival and had to settle for clearly second best. MRS. BEANS vied between rivals up the backstretch
and around the turn, fought back to the furlong marker then came up empty and steadily weakened. BOLT FORTY FIVE dueled inside a duo in the early
going, battled on into upper stretch then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
DEMIDANU led the way by a slim lead in opening stages then edged away to clear command, continued on top in hand around the turn, came two wide into
the lane, continued to pull away under confident handling and was never asked. GIRLS IN CHARGE edged up closer along the inside after initial stages and
raced off the top pair, continued to track leader along the rail then given cue at the quarter pole, cut the corner entering the lane, kept under firm handling
along the inside but was no match for the sharp winner and had to settle for second best. SABRIA was allowed to settle off the early pace, picked up the
tempo two wide around the turn, churned on through the lane and secured a share. OLIVE OYL raced off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn,
swung four wide entering the lane and lacked a needed rally. RAINBOW DASH lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and
never threatened. ADDABABY was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, continued to chase after the eventual winner around the turn then tired
in the drive.

Footnotes
SNAP'N TAP raced up close in early stages then had to wait for a clear path along the rail on the turn, tipped two wide for the drive, moved up between
rivals approaching the furlong marker, continued to dig in on top while holding a narrow lead and just lasted. SECRET BLARNEY rated off the early pace,
raced four paths wide around the turn, swung five wide into the lane, rallied along the outside and just missed. SAVAGE weakened after the start and lacked
early speed then quickly circled up to loom a threat near the quarter pole, sustained an up close bid four to five paths wide mid-stretch, failed to kick on with
the top pair and steadied nearing the wire. CODETOWIN tracked in contention up the backstretch then tapped along three to four wide near the quarter
pole, raced in some traffic without a clear path between rivals through the lane and just missed show. JONATHAN WHO was forwardly placed through early
stages then dueled with GRAND DESIGN around the turn, battled on into the final furlong then weakened late. GRAND DESIGN led the way in opening
stages then dueled for the lead with JONATHON WHO around the turn, battled on for the lead into the final furlong then weakened late. KENHEDOIT
dropped to last after initial stages, saved ground then swung wide for the drive and failed to move into contention.
