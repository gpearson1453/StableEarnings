YEARS AGO battled for the lead along the inside, dug in gamely late under left handed urging and proved best. GRAN MAMIBELLA dueled with the winner
three then two wide and finished second best. COURTLY raced outside and went evenly. LILAC LACE had sharp early speed between rivals two wide,
dropped back before a quarter then finished evenly. BACKSPLASH failed to menace. SPECIAL BEACH was no factor. DIVINE MARTHA reared at the start
and was never close. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
