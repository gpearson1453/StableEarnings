upper stretch, kicked clear under urging and was kept to the task. OFFALY COOL stalked two wide, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied into the
second spot and dug in gamely late to hold that position. BE HERE trailed in the early stages, saved ground, came three wide into the lane, closed well late
outside and got third. OCEANS MAP was a bit fractious in the gate, raced off the pace inside, then two wide, chased on the far turn and rallied late between
