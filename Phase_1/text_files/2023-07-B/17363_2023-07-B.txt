GROOVIN' IS BAK broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, maintained her advantage while saving ground through
the final turn, and held sway while never seriously threatened. BARBERRY BANDIT stalked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, launched
his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, shifted off the rail leaving the turn, and closed willingly two wide in the drive to prove clearly second best.
C C SUNRISE away alertly and tracked the leader in the run down the backside while racing between rivals, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
finished three wide in the drive to garner a share. TEXAS LEGACY away well and stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing two out
from the rail, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but was unable to make a serious late impact while finishing five wide in the drive. DARLA'S FURY
settled at the back of a compact field while racing three wide entering the backside, trailed the field into the final turn while racing two wide , and found her
best stride late while unable to threaten.

TOBESUNNY broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and widened her advantage through the lane under confident handling. PERFECT PENNY away well and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, was no match for the winner in the drive, but finishing willingly
from along the rail to prove second best. STRIKING VALUE hesitated at the start to get away slowly, raced into a stalking trip one out from the rail entering
the backside, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished evenly from along the rail in the drive to garner a share. DRILL BABY DRILL
away alertly and was allowed to settle off the early pace while racing two wide in the run down the backstretch, saved ground through the final turn, but
lacked the needed closing response when called upon. LIL'MISS INTAGLIO settled at the back of the pack entering the backside while saving ground at the
rail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

DYNAMITER away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace through the second turn and into the
backstretch, opened a clear lead in the run to the final turn, maintained his advantage into the lane, and held SILVER ARROW safely at bay to prove best.
SILVER ARROW settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail through the stretch the first time, began to improve her position in the run to the
final turn, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for the place. SILARONE
unhurried early while trailing the field into the lane the first time, began to advanced four wide upon entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the
final turn, and finished four wide in the drive to garner a share. TUXEDO broke sharply and stalked the leader through the stretch the first time while saving
ground at the rail, launched his bid two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to sustain his bid in the lane while fading late. EH TEE EM settled off the
early pace while saving ground at the rail through the stretch the first time, dropped back to trail in the run to the final turn, and needed more when called
upon. BLACKSTONE tracked the leader through the lane the first time while racing one out from the rail, struggled to keep tabs on the pacesetter in the run
to the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

CHI CHI'S SONG broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, before easing into a tracking trip entering the
backstretch, launched her bid two wide entering the final turn, took control in mid stretch and quickly drew clear. B C CHU CHU hopped at the start, but
chased the leaders three wide entering the first turn and took a narrow advantage three wide entering the backstretch, maintained her advantage through
the final turn, began to tire in mid stretch, and steadied slightly off heels, but managed to hold the place. PETERSON LANDING away well and stalked the
leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to
get up for a share. MS. STANFORD away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, chased the pacesetter from along the rail in
the run down the backside and into the final turn, but was outfinished in the late stages. HIGHER IMAGE unhurried early while trailing the field into the first
turn, bided her time at the back of the pack in the run down the backstretch, and failed to mount a serious late bid when called upon. The stewards
conducted a review of the stretch run following the running of this race, but after review made no change to the original order of finish.

DON WITH THE WIND broke sharply and raced to the lead from along rail entering the first turn and maintained that lead through the second turn and in the
run down the backside, held a clear advantage into the lane and held LIZZIES GIRL safely at bay late to prove best. LIZZIES GIRL stalked the leader
through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, maintained her position in the run down the backside while well in hand, rallied along the
inside entering the final turn, tipped two wide from the drive and closed gamely to prove clearly second best. PADDY D'ORO away alertly and tracked the
leader through the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, continued to track the pacesetter two wide in the run down the backside, rallied
two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response in the drive while holding on for a share. BODEGA unhurried early while dropping
back to trail entering the stretch the first time, continued to bide his time at the back of the field in the run down the backstretch, rallied smartly from along
the rail entering the final turn, and found his best stride late while closing at the rail in the stretch drive. JUST MAKE BELIEVE away well and stalked the
leader through the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, maintained his position in the run down the backstretch while being held three
wide, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. YOU DON'T OWN ME stalked the leader through
the stretch the first time while racing two out from the rail, continued with a wide trip throughout, and failed to make a late impact.

Footnotes
MOUNT LOKI settled off the early leaders while racing mid pack through the stretch the first time while saving ground at the rail, launched his bid two wide
entering the final turn, shifted three wide entering the lane, and got up in deep stretch to prove best. DEANARROW stalked the early pace while racing one
out from the rail through the stretch the first time, tipped four wide entering the backstretch and rushed up to force the issue in the run to the final turn,
battled from the outside of SOMTHING ELUSIVE through the final turn, took a narrow advantage into the lane, but was unable to fend off a late surge by
MOUNT LOKI in the closing strides. SOMTHING ELUSIVE broke sharply and tracked the leaders through the stretch the first time while saving ground at
the rail, angled off the rail entering the backstretch to force the issue three wide from between rivals in the run to the final turn, battled through the final turn
from the inside of DEANARROW, but was outfinished late while proving best of the rest. DAPPER DON settled well off the early pace while saving ground
at the rail through the stretch the first time, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive while improving his position late.
UNION MAN away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of SHOWMAN through the stretch the first time, struggled to hold his position in the run to
the final turn, raced two wide into the turn, but faded in the late going. HARBOUR STORM unhurried early while dropping back to trail, bided her time at the
back of the pack while racing four wide in the run down the backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. SHOWMAN
away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the stretch the first time, set a pressured pace from along the rail into the backstretch, began to
drop back approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
