Footnotes
ONE SOCK BILLY tracked the top two leaders in the early going then launched a bid in the two path near the quarter pole, poked a head in front at the
eighth pole and kicked clear. QUARTERNIGHT raced off the early pace, saved ground then tipped out two to three wide for the drive, produced a solid finish
and cleared second best. LET'S ROCK N ROLL hustled up out of the gate and engaged MACH SWEDE for the lead, led the way by a slim margin then
shook free past the three eighths pole, hustled up along the inside into the lane, could not hold off the eventual winner near the furlong marker, got headed
for the lead and weakened to show. MACH SWEDE broke on top then was quickly engaged by LETS ROCK N ROLL, pressed the pace into the turn,
flattened nearing the five sixteenths pole and continued to tire in the drive. TAIL OF SAMSON raced off the early speed, came five wide into the lane and
failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
XCARET sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear around the first turn, set the pace up the backstretch with GIRL PRO not far behind, held clear
over pursuers around the far turn, saved ground entering the lane, roused for more, responded willingly, drew off and finished ridden out. RIOBELLA raced
in the two path around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, launched a three wide bid around the far turn, sustained bid through the lane
and gained second best. GIRL PRO was forwardly placed around the first turn and stalked the leader up the backstretch, lost action upon entering the far
turn, dropped back briefly then launched a rail rebid entering the lane and got back up for a share. WAR MUSIC tugged a bit while racing under a snug hold
around the first turn, settled and tracked the pace up the backstretch, launched a bid near the inside then tipped two wide for the drive, ran on through the
lane and got nipped for show.

Footnotes
LOVER BOY quickly cleared the lead soon after the start and held a clear margin still unleashed around the turn, came two wide into the lane, tapped a few
times late and kept to task. MONTEREY PENINSULA raced outside off the early pace, picked up the tempo mid-way around the turn, swung four wide into
the lane and produced a solid finish. AWESOME FAMILY chased the leaders along the inside in early stages, saved ground around the turn, hustled along
the inside through the lane and gained show. GIANT GAMBLE raced in contention near the inside then tipped two wide for the drive and flattened
mid-stretch. CAPTAIN DON raced near midpack, hustled along three wide into the lane and needed more for late impact. KOSELIO raced off the pace,
hustled along two wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. JAMES'S MOONSHINE raced in early contention two to three wide then gave way in the
lane.

CALEBS LADY set a pressured pace through early stages then shook clear mid-way around the turn, saved ground into the lane, came out a path and
came under right handed pressure, dug in gamely on top and held clear. FREEDOM TO SPEED saved ground and steadily moved up closer and gained
close contention at the quarter pole, cut the corner entering the lane, sustained a solid bid for the winner and dug in to hold place. DAWSON'S STORM
raced near midpack, hustled along four wide into upper stretch, sustained a three wide bid and closed on the top pair. SECRET STRATEGY raced well off
the early pace, swung three wide into the lane, gathered momentum along the outside and finished with response in final stages. DIALED IN TO WIN raced
in range into the turn, moved up close three wide near the quarter pole, sustained bid into the final furlong then flattened late. STAIRSTEP TOHEAVEN
raced off the early pace then moved up closer along the rail late on the turn, edged a bit closer to mid-stretch then evened out. KILLIAN raced off the early
pace, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SINCERELY MINE hopped at the start and came away slowly, lacked speed, failed to
respond when called upon and passed tiring rivals in the lane. SPECIALSORTASTORM applied pace pressure to CALEBS LADY in early stages, continued
to chase the leader around the turn then tired in the drive. SURPRISE ROAD TRIP weakened after initial stages, raced wide into upper stretch and had no
response. INCA STROLL was forwardly placed in opening stages then came up empty near the three furlong marker.

Footnotes
MAGGIE D'CAUSE set the pace up the backstretch and held clear around the turn, saved ground entering the lane and held clear under a mild drive. LUV
MAP was forwardly placed along the inside in the opening quarter, steadied entering the turn, shifted to the two path, sustained a steady bid for the winner
and finished second best. WINZE raced in the back in the opening quarter then ranged up closer three paths wide around the turn, ran on through the lane
and cleared the rest. ACELA EXPRESS raced up close three wide through early stages, weakened upon entering the turn, launched a two wide rebid
entering the lane, ran on to the eighth pole then came up empty. TRIBAL QUEEN raced between foes briefly then took the inside spot and raced off the
early pace, edged closer along the rail late on the turn, sustained bid to the furlong marker then gave way.

Footnotes
LAWLESS JOHN broke sharp and opened up by a clear margin around the first turn, continued with a well clear advantage up the backstretch, rivals began
to edge closer late on the far turn, saved ground and given cue entering the lane, had more left in the tank, kept clear past the furlong marker then held late
under a driving finish. MIDNIGHT RULES secured inside position around the first turn and stalked the clear leader up the backstretch, let out a notch and
closed the gap on LAWLESS JOHN nearing the quarter pole, continued to chase after rival through the lane, edged closer in final stages but had to settle
for second best. SUCCESSION rated along the inside up the backstretch, hustled up three wide turning for home, kept on and captured a share. EVIL
KNIEVEL rated off the clear leader racing near midpack, picked up the tempo two wide around the far turn, sustained a bid in the two path into the final
furlong then got denied late for show. JUSTICE ONCE raced off the pace, swung three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. NATIVE
HELLRAISER tracked the clear pace setter up the backstretch, hustled along two paths wide late on the far turn, ran on into upper stretch then came up
empty. WELLER ROGUE raced off the pace, swung four to five wide into the lane and had no response.
