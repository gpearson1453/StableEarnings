TO WIN was restless in the gate, hopped at the start, closed willingly inside rivals and was along in time while all out. TANTRUM was bumped at the start,
settled close up, drew closer in the six path in upper stretch, had to avoid the fallen rivals just past the eight pole, dug in gamely and just missed. MOBIL
SOLUTION also restless in the gate, was allowed to settle, altered course sharply inward past the eighth pole to avoid the fallen rival and improved position
for a minor share. ALTISSIMO was fractious in the gate, broke alertly to gain a narrow lead into the clubhouse turn while drifting out to the five path, gave up
the lead before a quarter, chased the pace into the stretch, also altered course sharply to avoid the fallen rival past the furlong marker then dropped back.
HOPPY GILMORE bore out at the start bumping TANTRUM, dropped back to trail before a half and avoided the fallen rival past the furlong marker.
MORESTRIDE broke alertly then was hung wide into the clubhouse turn by ALTISSIMO, regained the lead in the six path before a quarter, set the pace into
the stretch, suffered a catastrophic injury just past the furlong marker, fell and was euthanized. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT
TOOK NO ACTION.

BEER CHASER broke in front then gave up the lead briefly on the first turn, regained the advantage before a quarter, set the balance of the pace and
widened through the stretch while drifting out to win as much the best. STRIKE APPEAL four wide into the first turn, loomed boldly two wide before a half,
chased the winner the balance of the trip and finished second best. COMPLY gained a narrow lead briefly on the first turn, dropped back on the second turn
then came on again late in the four path. SO DIALED IN checked behind rivals on the first turn, stalked the pace three wide then lacked the needed
response. SURF AND TURF was no threat. FRANCO had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half.

for a minor share. BELLAVALENCIA bore out at the start, pressured the winner two wide for six furlongs and weakened late. WELLOILEDCAT was no
factor. TIPARILLO showed little. WHAT KNOT had good early speed along the inside, got out, dropped out of it on the far turn, was eased to the wire and
