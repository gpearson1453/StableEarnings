the far turn, angled out, rallied three wide into the stretch and closed for second. BOLT OF PARADISE was bumped at the start, tracked on the inside, then
between rivals, was shuffled back on the far turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied mildly for third. AMARETTO SOUR was slammed at the start, raced
off the rail, off the pace, moved up four wide on the far turn and then rallied mildly. SILVER SPRINTER was slammed at the start, raced off the pace, saved
ground on the far turn and closed belatedly. CAPTURE THIS raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, angled in, tried to rally inside,
then lacked room and checked at the eighth pole. BANDULU QUEEN set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled inside on the far turn and tired. GRACE

close up two wide, bid between rivals, dueled, faded on the turn and was steadied at the quarter pole. DIXIE GROOVE broke outward bumping hard with a
rival and lost the rider. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.
