Footnotes
NEVERPOPTHECORK settled in the three path the opening turn, started a four wide bid approaching the three eighths pole and took the nod at the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn off the rail and held well under steady stretch handling. OFFICER STONE raced boxed in on the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole and improved in the four path of the far turn, then dueled through later yards for second. RED HOT TODDY stalked
three wide on the first turn, took the nod toward the three eighths pole and dueled from that point, was met at the five sixteenths, came in a path past the
pole then dropped back and flattened stride into the far turn. DE'S CASTLE stalked two deep then took the nod into the backstretch and dueled from that
point, was forced in and had his heels clipped past the five sixteenths pole then faded off the rail on the far turn. IN HIGH GEAR stalked off the rail the first
turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened approaching the far turn. HILLBILLY ROCK saved ground well off the pace, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, fell over MONKEY WRENCH past the five sixteenths pole but got up and walked off. The latter took the lead leaving the
thirteen sixteenths pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met into the backstretch and dueled from that point, but steadied while in tight
quarters at the rail, clipped the heels of De's Castle and fell passing the five sixteenths pole, but got up and walked off. A Stewards inquiry resulted in the
disqualification of Red Hot Toddy to fifth place for causing the incident leaving the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
CRAFTY WINDSOR CAT rated the pace inside through the backstretch, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. SILVER RULES rated off the early pace toward the inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the turn at the
rail and dueled through the stretch for second. SPARKLEINYOUREYE gave chase and raced four wide through the turn, dug in leaving the turn and took
the nod for third under the wire. LA MADDALENA engaged in close chase through the backstretch, remained a factor in the three path on the turn but
relented in the duel through the stretch. OUR GREAT NOTION gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn then flattened. POLISH THE DIAMOND gave
chase, rounded the turn five wide and showed little in the lane. IHEARTRAINACOMN broke a step slow then gave chase toward the inside, was eased to
the six path on the turn and showed little in the lane.

Footnotes
PERSONAL FINANCE engaged in close chase through the backstretch, contested at a slim disadvantage two deep while between horses on the turn, took
the nod past the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to hold off the game challenge of MO EH HENNESSY, who had a brief early lead then gave chase
through the backstretch, raced close three wide through the turn and dug in gamely to the wire. THE CLOWN gave chase and raced at the rail into the turn,
angled to the six path approaching the top of the lane, finished well and was gaining on the top two. GREAT GOOGLYMOOGLY was hustled to the lead
inside and rated the pace from the three eighths pole, came under pressure nearing the quarter, raced at the rail on the turn, was met into the lane and
flattened inside the sixteenth pole. BASHDAFLASH lunged and was steadied leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the
turn and ran evenly in the stretch. FLASH OF DAY chased outside, raced in the six path on the turn and proved empty down the lane. RYE WHISKEY gave
chase, rounded the turn about the five path then flattened in the lane. TRICKY STRONG chased through the backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn

the far turn and came along for third late. NAPA VALLEY saved early ground, gave chase toward the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the
three path, then flattened mid-stretch. GREAT DAYS AHEAD saved ground well off the early pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on
the far turn and weakened the final sixteenth. KRUG rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the
four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. MY MIRACLE MAN stalked three wide the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but

on the far turn. ROYAL PAIN raced well back off the rail, gave chase from the three eighths pole but showed little response. SUBJECT TO CHANGE rated

Footnotes
ICY STARE took over leaving the chute and rated the pace through the backstretch, was urged leaving the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn then
steadily handled in the stretch. HOLY HIP chased the early pace toward mid track, rounded the turn near the rail and dueled through the stretch for second.
TALENTED CORINNA tapered toward mid track and gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. WEST
COAST WILDCAT chased inside, raced off the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch then flattened the final sixteenth. DAPPLESANDDIAMONDS steadied
off the heels of Talented Corinna past the half mile pole then gave chase toward the outside, raced in the four path on the turn then flattened in the lane.
FIDDLERSHOTPLEASUR gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path and showed little in the lane. MY BEST GIRL chased, angled to the seven path
through the turn and passed tiring horses in the stretch. MOON WALKIN and PRINCESS MIA ROSE were not factors. ESTILO AMOROSO gave chase
then weakened at the rail on the turn. The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Talented Corinna, for alleged interference
shortly after the start, lodged by the rider of Dapplesanddiamonds.
