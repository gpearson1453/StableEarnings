Footnotes
GHOSTLY REVIVAL had speed from the start outside while under a firm hold, surged three wide on the turn to make the lead before a half then drew off
under mild right handed urging to win going away. HAUGHTY PRAISE vied for the early lead three wide, matched strides through the turn two wide then
was no match for the winner. GO RAY slow early, had a mild rally late four wide. THELMA LUCILLE was restless in the gate, battled for the early lead along
the inside, dropped back before the turn then lacked the needed response. MOST ADORABLE contested the lead two wide then along the inside through
the turn and weakened in the stretch. RIVERANDFAIRMOUNT stumbled at the start and trailed.

POETIC VERSE sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the turn, was headed by the runner up nearing the quarter pole, dug in gamely to
regain command before the furlong marker and edged clear under a strong hand ride. PULPIT'S PURRFECT stalked the pace into the turn, slipped through
along the rail to make the lead near the quarter pole, battled until deep stretch but couldn't handle the winner. PASSIONFORTREASURE trailed early and
closed a gap late along the inside. MALICED close up from the start, loomed boldly four wide nearing the quarter pole then was outfinished. COMMAND
STRIKE pressed the pace two then three wide into the stretch and faded late. SIERRA DIAMOND had speed through the turn then gave way.

OFFLEE TRICKY away alertly, gained a narrow lead before a quarter, set a pressured pace two wide into the stretch then drew off under a strong hand ride
to win as much the best. COUNTRY STYLE broke sharply and had a brief lead, pressured the winner along the inside then was no match while well clear
for second. MERE BAG OF SHELLS stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch, shifted out to the four path and lacked the needed response.
DOMINUS O'S ME unhurried early, swung wide entering the stretch and passed tiring rivals. PENNY'S TREASURE failed to menace. DANCE DRAMA with
the second flight two wide, gave way on the stretch. OH EYE SEE trailed.

RIGHT TRAPPE bumped at the start, rushed to the lead two wide leaving the clubhouse turn, set the balance of the pace, and just lasted under right
handed urging. DIAMONDS N DEW drifted inward soon after the start putting inside rivals in tight, was taken under a strong hold early, chased the pace,
rallied determinedly in the five path through the stretch and just missed getting up in time. HIGH FIRE unhurried early, found her best stride late near the
inside. SHE'S CRAFTY bobbled and was bumped at the start, squeezed between rivals soon thereafter, trailed into the stretch then closed a gap late along
the inside. QUARANTINA set the pace around the clubhouse turn, chased the winner into the far turn then faded. BALLROOM BLITZ bumped at the start,
was in tight soon thereafter, brushed nearing the half mile marker causing her rider to checked then lost momentum. ANNMARIA checked repeatedly along
the rail through the first turn, shifted outside, brushed with BALLROOM BLITZ near the half mile marker, moved closer three wide then came up empty.
