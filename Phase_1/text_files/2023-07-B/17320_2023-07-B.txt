Footnotes
BUCK WILD settled off the early going, advanced through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch, angled towards the rail, surged late and got up
under strong pressure. BUFF AND SHINE chased the top pair early on, raced two to three wide around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire to just
miss racing five deep. SUMMER ASH was off slowly, void of early speed, moved up from the far outside in the stretch and closed in belatedly. ALMOND
CIDER dueled two deep outside of rival, had a clear lead into the upper stretch and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. BRANTLEYS BIG GUN was
allowed to settle early on, saved ground and had no late rally. LOOKIN BACK LUCKY dueled for the early lead from the inside and tired readily.

Footnotes
SACHMO stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, shifted out two to three wide from the outside of Spiritual King and just got up his final
strides under all out pressure. SPIRITUAL KING showed good early foot from the inside to set the early pace, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and was
wore down in the final stages to just miss. GALILEE was unhurried early under a tight hold, moved up near the inside at the five sixteenths pole, angled five
wide and rallied willingly to the wire. GAMBLING TZAR settled off the early pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning
bid. JUMP FOR THE WIN tracked the early leader from the outside two deep and faded in the drive. SKIMBLE SHANKS was unhurried early on, raced
along the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a bid.

ME DARLIN KATHLEEN showed good early foot along the inside down the backstretch to have a clear lead, widened its margin through the stretch, raced
well clear and was a handy winner. HI HEELED WARRIOR dropped back early on, moved up from the outside into the upper stretch, rallied to secure the
second place position but was no match for the winner. WARISHA coaxed along chasing the top pair, raced two deep between around the far turn and had
not enough for the top pair. ROSE VALLEY was bumped slightly, in tight in the early stages, raced five wide near the three sixteenth pole and had no late
rally. NOWYOUSCAN'TLEAVE was slow early on, raced near the inside into the upper stretch and had no response. CHA CHA CHIQUITA chased the pace

BEYOND THE BEND raced mid pack early on, moved up near the inside past the five sixteenths pole, angled out to race from the outside in the stretch and
rallied willingly to narrowly secure the place position. NICE WEATHER dueled from the inside down the backstretch through the far turn and weakened a bit
in the drive. HIDE THE RANSOM bumped soundly at the start, raced near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough. MR. PETE
dropped back off the early going, raced two deep near the three eighths pole, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. CARGO SHIP coaxed
along three deep outside of foes and faded in the stretch run. TURNPIKE BOB was bumped soundly at the start, raced five to six wide around the far turn
and never threatened.

Footnotes
FAMISHED showed good early speed to set the pace, drew off to be well clear through the stretch under a steady hand ride and was throttled down late.
SALTO DE TIGRE tracked the top pair from the inside, continued an inside bid past the quarter pole and finished second best while racing three to four wide
in the stretch. DEE JAY was off very slow, lost a considerable amount off ground at the start, raced in after the poor start, loomed four wide near the quarter
pole and flattened out. STRAWBERRY TREAT was unhurried early on, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final bid in the drive.
EAGLES CRY tracked the early leader three deep and faded. HERE'S WALDO failed to sustain a bid.
