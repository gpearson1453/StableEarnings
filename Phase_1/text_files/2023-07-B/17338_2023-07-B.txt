Footnotes
ESPRESSO LUNGO , always close up, dueled outside JONES FALLS around the turn, was challenged on his outside by MY SLICK NICK in upper stretch,
drifted in approaching the eighth pole and narrowly prevailed. MY SLICK NICK stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced three wide entering the
stretch, bid for the lead in upper stretch and hung. I'M NOT A BABY lacked speed, raced in the two path turning for home, swung to the four path near the
sixteenth pole and rallied. JONES FALLS , taken to the inner rail leaving the first turn, saved ground dueling around the far turn, weakened in upper stretch,
steadied behind the winner approaching the eighth pole and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. NOBLE PRENDERGAST swung to the three path leaving
the far turn and gave way. SPIRITUAL GHOST , wide leaving the far turn, was outrun. CYPRES STATION , rated back entering the backstretch, briefly
steadied near the five eighths pole, hugged the inner rail to the far turn, faltered and was eased. An objection by the rider of JONES FALLS against the
winner for alleged interference near the three sixteenth pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
JANE STREET , brushed at the break, was taken to rate four wide nearing the half mile marker, was deftly maneuvered to the rail leaving the far turn and
commenced a run, advanced to the inside of rivals then angled three wide soon into the lane, closed steadily under some right handed asks and collared
FREE ADMISSION inside the furlong grounds, dueled, gained a slim lead late and was edging away under a steady hand ride. FREE ADMISSION ,
bumped at the break, sped up to the inside of LUCINA to take command then cleared off heading to the half mile pole, set the pace two wide into the
stretch, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, dug in when confronted, battled to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. LUCINA , away to the early lead,
was headed from her inside leaving the five eighths, pursued two wide around the turn, stayed on range to about the three sixteenths, faded and saved the
show. LILY MOR , bumped at the start, pursued off the rail but came up empty in the drive. PRINCESS LEXI saved ground chasing the early pace and
weakened. NO SHARING broke outward, corrected and failed to threaten. GAZALANI dropped back early and was eased late.

Footnotes
CALMING STORM , away in good order, found a forward position and tracked to the inside of a pair of rivals, eased out approaching the stretch, closed
sharply under some pressure and wrested command from PAY ZONE with a furlong remaining, eagerly bounded away and won under a mild drive. PAY
ZONE sped clear after a furlong, set a rated pace around the turn, came two to three wide for the drive, failed to resist the winner in mid stretch but kept on
with interest to secure the place. BOX N BEN , away alertly, chased three deep leaving the far turn, came wider for the drive and churned on. BAR DOWN
EXPRESS , urged along soon after the break, found himself well back nearing the three eighths, angled out, circled four wide into the stretch but failed to
generate a serious rally. SURPRISE HELLO gave early chase between rivals and weakened. BATTLE OF BASTOGNE , well placed saving ground, made a
mild run nearing the quarter pole, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths then faded in handy fashion the final sixteenth. LUNAR DASH , off the pace,
raced three wide past the five sixteenths and failed to menace. HARNESS CREEK failed to keep pace.

NO EASY DAYS chased the pace outside UNCLE JAKE, overtook that one entering the stretch, was challenged on his outside by ELDEST SON inside the
sixteenth pole and dug in tenaciously. ELDEST SON saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail turning for home, advanced in the three path between
horses in mid stretch, bid for the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was not good enough. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR stalked the pace, circled the turn
three deep, floated to the four path in upper stretch and failed to sustain his move. UNCLE JAKE made the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail to the
quarter pole then steadily gave way. WICKED SECRET was outrun. NEW YORK PANTHER raced along the inner rail on the turn and retreated through the
stretch.

ISABELLA'S GLORY , unhurried early while off the inside, was sent up between rivals nearing the three eighths, dropped to the rail to advance into the
stretch, eased out past the three sixteenths, continued her progression under right handed asks, reeled in the leader heading towards the sixteenth pole and
drew out while kept to task. RAMADHAAN (IRE) drafted back off the early pace and was taken well wide while outside rivals heading to the turn, shifted out
making some headway past the quarter pole, failed to accelerate with the winner but kept on grinding and just got up for the place. FIVECOMMATWO sped
clear, secured the inside and set the pace, opened up under a ride soon into the lane, maintained the advantage under a drive leaving mid stretch, could not
withstand the winner soon after, gave way grudgingly and was edged for second. DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD , hustled up early, saved ground stalking the pace,
eased out three wide to pursue into the lane, lacked a punch heading to mid stretch and faded. FASHIONISTA , taken to rate, dropped back some leaving
the far turn, saved ground into the stretch but lacked a rally. QUEEN TAPITURE chased off the rail, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and gave way.
MISS ANTIETAM , rank soon after the break, recovered and stalked off the inside, was pushed along four wide entering the stretch, failed to go on and
retreated through the final three sixteenths.

LIQUIDATOR , three deep disputing the pace around the turn, battled outside HAPPY CLOUDS through the stretch and drove clear. HAPPY CLOUDS
raced in the two path between horses while disputing the pace around the turn, continued gamely through the stretch but was second best. SWEET SHUGS
, sent soon after the break, hugged the inner rail while disputing the pace on the turn then weakened through the stretch. MISS GEORGIE lacked speed,
raced along the inner rail on the turn, eased out in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY stalked the duel on the turn, drifted five wide
approaching the stretch and weakened. MYSTIC MALIBU trailed.

Footnotes
GOD IS LOVE rated kindly three wide while tracking the embattled leaders, bid three deep leaving the half mile marker, gained a slim advantage nearing
mid turn, wandered outward a bit as he and WICKED MAD emerged in their own battle entering the lane, kept on under right handed asks dueling past mid
stretch, edged clear late and held firm. WICKED MAD vied outside SHOFAR early on, sparred between runners leaving the far turn, dug in after GOD IS
LOVE moved to command, stayed on to duel inside that one through the lane, switched over to his left lead late but held well. FERMAT settled towards the
inside, angled out around the turn, circled four wide pursuing the leaders into the stretch but came up empty. SHOFAR set a pressured pace towards the
rail, could not go with the top pair leaving the three eighths and weakened.

Footnotes
CARTWHEEL hugged the inner rail around the turn while chasing the pace, swung out in upper stretch, took command under urging near the sixteenth pole
then drew off. LOVE IS STRONG , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, floated four wide in upper stretch and rallied. ESPERANNNA assumed a
clear lead near the five eighths pole, saved ground around the turn, remained clear to the eighth pole and gave way lae. FLOATING BY , kept five wide on
the turn, was not a factor. GOLD TIME VIXEN , well placed in the three path on the turn, moved to the four path approaching the stretch and gave way.
TEQUILA FOG prompted the pace for a quarter mile, pulled up lame leaving the backstretch and was vanned off. BAD TEMPER , checked near the five and
a half furlongs pole, pulled up leaving the backstretch and walked off. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action
was taken.
