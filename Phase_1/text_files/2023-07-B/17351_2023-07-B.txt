encouragement, and was caught before the wire. REMARKABLE ELI show early speed outside then sat in striking position from the three path, rallied into
the drive inside of OMEGASSHOOTINGSTAR then was checked deep stretch after losing his path. BEAUGATTI tracked from the two path, chased, and
failed to threaten. CHESTER SLEW chased four to five wide and tired. CARRERA CABALLO shifted out to the four path in the backstretch, and was outrun.

SMARTY RIVER PANTS set for speed from between foes but was outsprinted to the turn, uncoiled a rail bid into the stretch, took control and edged clear.
AMUSING WAY vied inside to the opening turn, gained the lead in the final turn, edged away and was out finished. AWHITESPORTSCOAT opted to settle
off the early pace, gained late under the encouragement, and needed more ground. SCHOCHOH attended the early pace from the five path, produced a
mild bid into the stretch, and flattened. ISLE OF SKYE fractious in the gate, chased outside then fanned four wide in the far turn, lost path at the head of the
stretch and finished evenly. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) contended the early pace from between foes, was unable to move on with rivals and gave way.

JUMEIRAH COAST stumbled leaving, vied outside of DREADNAUGHT through the backstretch then was approached by SILVER SPUN in the far turn,
responded to pressure at the head of the lane, battled determinedly inside to get some breathing room, and held sway. PERDITION was checked leaving
the chute, tracked just off the rail, gained closer order nearing the stretch, rallied between rivals late, dug in to score the place spot in a multi-horse scramble
to the finish. SILVER SPUN sat just off the pace outside, moved up alongside JUMEIRAH COAST to test the lead, rallied between foes and was bested late,
but was able to hold on for show. KOVACS tracked outside through the backstretch, was asked to quicken entering the final turn, moved up menacingly
outside but was out finished after a game effort. DREADNAUGHT vied inside through the backstretch, was unable to move on with rival, kept on inside, and
weakened. FROBISHER BAY sat in range, and tired.

WANDERING WEST raced in close quarters leaving the opening turn from along the rail, lacked running room in the far turn, angled out sharply at the
three-sixteenth pole, and won going away. LONESOME CAT saved ground early, lodged a bid near the quarter pole, dueled outside of THE BEAT, and won
the nod for second. THE BEAT vied for the early lead, dueled outside of SIMMS to the final turn, shook loose of the aforementioned then was under
pressure late stretch and was worn down. SIMMS contested the pace from just off the rail, dueled inside of THE BEAT but was unable to move on into the
stretch and weakened in the late stages. NEXT JOURNEY sat in range from the three path, and failed to threaten in the drive. LANNY MAC went four to five
wide through the opening turn, had no response when roused, and retreated. TUCKER TIME stalked outside, and tired early.

TOOL TIME quickly took command, remained unchallenged entering the stretch, and opened up under light handling. ESCROW STYLE brushed leaving
then trailed the field, closed gamely outside, and got up just in time for place honors. MOHAMAD broke inward, chased inside under urging, and was
hooked late. DOUSEAWHATISEA reluctant to load then loaded without the rider, sat just off the pace, went in pursuit of the leader in the final turn, and had
no rally in the drive. VANTASTICCANAVERAL offered a late mild bid. BE NAUGHTY WITH ME broke outward brushing ESCROW STYLE, tracked wide
through the backstretch, and came up empty. MIDNITE CHILL tracked outside, and lacked a bid.

HYPERFOCUS angled to the rail approaching the first turn, saved ground in the two path, roused along the rail then grabbed the lead at the eighth pole,
and kicked clear. SOLO RING sent for speed then emerged the leader leaving the opening turn, showed the way through the backstretch, was overtaken in
the final furlong, and finished up second best. SLAATS raced four wide into the opening turn, moved up closer in the three path, chased the leader in the
final turn, and weakened late. VIATURE raced at the back of the pack, and rallied belatedly. ASYOUBELIEVE vied inside but was outsprinted in the turn,
lacked running room leaving the backstretch, loomed boldly near the three-sixteenth pole, and wilted. ROCKTILLYOUDROP settled outside, took closer
order in the five path, and failed to threaten. RUMOHR REIGNS sat midpack from the four path, and tired early.

AMERICAN BLAZE saved ground while three to four wide, advanced outside through the final turn, responded to handling in a long drive, dug in gamely
deep stretch, and narrowly prevailed. KAUAI DAN was crowded at the start, dropped back in the opening turn, gained closer order from along the rail
leaving the backstretch, struck the front after the quarter pole, weakened deep stretch under handling, and was bested. KYSTONE saved from the rail,
drove four wide on the final turn, chased the leader under steady urging, and was outkicked. RIVERSIDE trailed in the early stages, raced wide through the
backstretch, came under heavy urging into the stretch, was gaining late, and needed more ground. IT'S A FACT was outsprinted to the turn, raced in closest
pursuit of the leader, and lacked a rally. CALI CONQUEST raced three wide in the opening turn, was widest through the backstretch, and past tiring rivals.
MUDINATOR sent for outside speed, was reserved off the pacesetter from the three path, and came up empty in drive. NORTHERN JEWEL saved ground
and lacked a bid. READYTOTAPNSING hustled to the front setting the early pace, moved to good margins through the backstretch, saw the gap close
nearing the quarter pole and faltered.

Footnotes
SMART AS ME steadied in close quarters early, advanced inside through the backstretch then set sights on a weary GLAVA, swept the lead then drew out
while kept to task. AT ATTENTION rated well off the ambitious leader, drove three wide at the quarter pole, and rallied through the stretch but was no match
for the winner in the drive. GLAVA cleared the field early, opened up to a significant lead up the backstretch, increased the distance between him and field
through the far turn, saw the margins rapidly decrease after the quarter pole, drifted out while showing signs of tiring, and was able to hold on for show.
BOITANO raced near the back, advanced inside nearing the quarter pole, and lacked the closing response that was needed. DRINKING AGAIN raced four
wide from the second flight, and lacked a rally. GREEK GEEK unhurried early, and lacked a kick. RACE HOME went three-wide into the opening turn,
trailed through the backstretch, and lacked a serious bid. COUNTRIFIED failed to be a factor. QUINTO SOL fanned three wide through the opening turn,
reserved off the early pacesetter and tired early.

Footnotes
DECOY settled midpack, drove five wide off the final turn, responded to handling then grabbed the lead at the eighth pole, dug in to prevail. I'M DASHING
raced four wide into the backstretch, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, moved up menacingly at the head of the stretch and was outkicked.
MACHINE trailed the field, roused into the lane, and closed late to earn show. RAILWAY raced in closest pursuit of the leader while five wide, closed the
gap quickly through the final turn, rallied four wide entering the stretch and was rundown deep stretch. RUNNINFORCOVER produced a mild late rally.
SILVERFOOT rallied belatedly. LIL ZAPPER broke alertly then cleared the front, opened up to good margins through the backstretch, was under attack after
the quarter pole, and retreated in the stretch. FATHER O'FLAHERTY outrun throughout.
