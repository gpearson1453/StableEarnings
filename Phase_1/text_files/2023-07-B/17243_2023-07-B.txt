Footnotes
MARVELETTE assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was challenged in mid stretch and dug in stubbornly. CUSH EFFECT saved
ground around the turn, remained inside horses in upper stretch and mid stretch, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and closed nicely. PALACSINTA
prompted the pace outside the winner, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and weakened. TRES MARIA'S DREAM , not an early factor, raced three deep
leaving the far turn and offered a mild gain. IRISH MIRAGE had a mild move in the two path on the far turn and gave way in the stretch drive. IRISH
ZAPPER , always inside horses, was not a factor. ELLYMARIE stalked the pace while hugged the inner rail and gave way entering the stretch. MODERN
SOCIETY was outrun.

Footnotes
VIOLENT ROCK rated off foes soon after the break, advanced between foes while under a ride past the five sixteenths, continued progress between
runners near mid stretch, eased out, surged to command leaving the sixteenth marker and eagerly drew out under a drive. LANDON JACK had speed three
deep early then pulled clear in hand heading to the half, set a rated pace two wide around the turn, was put to a solid ride in upper stretch, failed to contain
the winner's charge past the sixteenth pole, faded but saved the place. RASCALLY REBEL , urged along from the start, dropped in to save ground, chased
to the inside of rivals past the five sixteenths, stayed inside to gain past mid stretch then flattened out late. BY ITS ABSENCE , ridden along off the inside
giving pursuit, dropped back some mid turn, shifted out five wide and came back on mildly through the final seventy yards. JUDY'S ARMY was hustled up to
the inside of the leader leaving the five eighths, rated off that one and angled three wide, made a mild run past the five sixteenths, stayed on to about mid
stretch then faded. MORETHANREADYEDDIE brushed the outer part of the stall and was away last, lagged back, angled three wide leaving the far turn but
failed to respond.

WISH ME HOME broke alertly and quickly went clear, set the pace along the inner rail, opened up in mid stretch then prevailed under steady handling.
TULCHAN outside the winner throughout, was under urging near the three eighths pole, dropped back some in upper stretch then gamely closed.
HARDSPUN REASON lacked speed outside horses down the backstretch, swung wide for the drive and rallied. OPPOSITES ATTRACT raced in the two
path around the far turn, eased out, had mild bid to the eighth pole then failed to sustain the move. ROMP , rated back approaching the first turn, angled out
in upper stretch and passed tired horses. THE LAST SCIP , a forward factor along the inner rail throughout, gave way. SILK WAR hugged the inner rail
down the backstretch and was no factor. SEA GHOST was no factor.

Footnotes
CHARGE TO VICTORY rated outside a rival mid turn, angled out and was put to pressure entering the lane, straightened to be about five wide, closed
steadily under right handed asks, put a head in front outside rivals in deep stretch then prevailed. HIS NAME IS SUE prompted the pace while saving
ground, eased out in upper stretch, worked between runners past mid stretch, kept on gamely to the inside of rivals and just missed. SPOTTED BULL , off
slowly when straightening his head as the gates sprung, regrouped and edged up off the rail heading to the half mile marker, tracked three wide outside
WILD BEHAVIOR nearing the lane, bid four wide to take a slim lead a sixteenth out, battle on between runners in deep stretch then hung late. WILD
BEHAVIOR had speed outside rivals then cleared under some rating nearing the half mile marker, set a rated pace two wide past the five sixteenths, came
under pressure in upper stretch, clung to command past mid stretch, ceded the lead a sixteenth from home and weakened late. HE'S INCREDIBLE had
speed between foes then eased back off the leader nearing the half mile pole, shifted in for the run around the turn, lacked a response in upper stretch and
gave way.

Footnotes
ALLIALLIOXENFREE brushed with DONNA'S COURAGE leaving the gate, corrected and was nudged clear early, set a rated pace two wide, spurted away
after being set down in upper stretch, kept on under a solid drive through the final sixteenth and held sway. GENIEINABRIDLE , taken to rate off the rail
early, dropped back some leaving the far turn, came under a solid ride approaching the stretch, gathered steam past the three sixteenths, knifed her way
between rivals inside the sixteenth marker, switched over to her correct lead and gained. BLACK DIAMOND RAIN stalked the winner three wide, was under
pressure pursuing into the lane, kept on trying through the final eighth and saved the show. MYSISTERNANCY was rated back while saving ground early
on, eased out to progress between runners mid turn, altered out for room inside the furlong grounds and rallied. SKYLAR'S SISTER prompted the pace
while saving ground and gave way grudgingly. TRITONE GAL broke a step slow, was steadied between runners leaving the far turn, angled five wide into
the lane, ranged up past mid stretch then hung late. SWEET BEAUTY broke a bit slow, was taken to rate soon after while five wide, circled the turn four
wide with a bit of a move then faded. DONNA'S COURAGE brushed with the winner at the break and failed to menace. IRISH VALENTINE saved ground
and faltered.

EONS , three wide the first turn, remained in the three path chasing the pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, drifted four wide turning for
home, gained a short lead in upper stretch, lost the advantage near the sixteenth pole, battled and got the bob. PAO ALTO (FR) , patiently rated behind
horses down the backstretch and into the far turn, swung four wide approaching the stretch, floated five wide in upper stretch, gained a short lead outside
the winner near the sixteenth pole and just missed in a game effort. SKY'S NOT FALLING saved ground around the turns, remained along the rail and
reached a striking position in mid stretch and flattened out. ROYAL PATRONAGE (FR) set the pace along the inner rail, drifted out entering the stretch,
gave way the final furlong and drifted out while on his left lead. BEACON HILL , in the two path between horses down the backstretch and around the far
turn, prompted the pace to the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
HYBRID ECLIPSE lagged well back off the contested pace, was scrubbed on leaving the half marker with little response, began to gather momentum
leaving the quarter pole, advanced between foes near mid stretch, shifted out and responded to a right handed ask a sixteenth out, leveled off under steady
hand encouragement through the final fifty yards and rolled past late. AWARD WANTED , brushed at the break, was sent up between foes nearing the
quarter pole and engaged INTREPID DAYDREAM, vied outside that one into and around the turn, dueled on near even terms leaving the quarter pole,
wandered out before being corrected with right handed encouragement past the furlong grounds, moved to a slim advantage inside the sixteenth marker,
kept on gamely but just could not fend off the winner's charger. INTREPID DAYDREAM took over leaving the chute and set a pressured pace towards the
rail, went head to head with AWARD WANTED from upper stretch past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly in the final yards. DECO STRONG ,
brushed with AWARD WANTED leaving the gate, edged up and stalked between foes, angled four wide under a ride entering the stretch, gained some past
mid stretch then flattened out late. MISTY MAUVE moved up early along the rail, stalked inside a pair of foes, was under pressure past the three eighths
and gave way nearing mid stretch. CASHING BIG CHECKS , away to a brief early lead, was overtaken by INTREPID DAYDREAM exiting the chute, stalked
three deep into and around the turn, wandered outward entering the stretch and retreated.

Footnotes
B DETERMINED lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail through the stretch, closed strongly, led near the sixteenth pole and
drove clear. BOSS MAN J J chased the pace two wide around the turn, floated out turning for home, sprinted clear in mid stretch, failed to hold off the
winner and finished gamely. ZIP LINE TO HEAVEN saved ground on the turn, moved to the three path in upper stretch and finished evenly. ODINSON ,
between horses most of the trip, had a slight rally. KOBE TOUGH , up close outside horses on the turn, was four wide turning for home and weakened.
TALL ORDER , a bit rank at the break, raced at least four wide around the turn and was not a factor. TENAX raced near the inner rail on the turn and was
no factor. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE showed speed along the inner rail, drifted out turning for home, faltered and was eased late.
