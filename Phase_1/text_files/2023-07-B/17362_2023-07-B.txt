Footnotes
GRAYTANA bumped MACASSA at the start, set the pace in the two path and drew off readily while ridden out. MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) had her head
turned at the start, raced off the pace two wide and rallied for the place. HUSTLE QUEEN chased the pace two wide, lacked the needed rally and held on
for the show. KINGDOM'S SPIRIT raced off the pace three wide and improved position in the lane. ALWAYS CONNECTED saved ground and failed to
menace. INSATIABLE EVA was off a bit slowly, raced two wide and never threatened. MACASSA was bumped at the start, chased the pace from the rail
and retreated through the lane. SECRET OF SARATOGA prompted the winner in the three path and faltered in the stretch. J J MONET hit the starting gate,
raced four wide and came up empty in the lane. OUR LA DOLCE VITA was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
CAPTURE THE LION set the pace in the two path, shook away from an outer foe leaving the turn and opened up while tipping out to the four path into the
stretch, and held safe under a drive. LOYAL LOUIE stalked in the four path, swung out to the six path into the lane, and ran on to chase home the winner for
place. FREE SMOKE rated in the three path, was under a heavy drive turning into the stretch, tipped outward passing the eighth pole, and was up for show.
EIGHTNINEGO prompted the winning pacesetter from the three path into the turn, lost touch with that rival and was urged from the five path into the lane,
evened out in the final furlong, and was nailed to miss minor placings. STERLING HARMONY chased in the two path but made no impact. DENYING
always trailed from the two to six paths.

SHAKE UP was bumped between foes at the start, raced up close in the four path, took over midway around the turn and drew off under a drive. NICO'S
HAVING FUN set a pressured pace in the two path, was collared by the winner midway around the turn but kept on inside to hold the place. GEOTHERMAL

angled five wide nearing the quarter pole, had aim outside in upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. NORFIE broke inwardly and bumped foes at
the start, chased the pace five wide and faded in the lane. GREAT KOSTAS was bumped at the start, vied between foes in the three path and retreated

Footnotes
PURE SPEIGHT stalked inside, was coaxed along while shifting out midway around the turn, bid from the five path into the lane, took the lead, and drew
clear. EARTH tracked in the four path, was cued midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path into the stretch, and kept on to get up for place late.
LEE ANN'S WARRIOR set the pace in the two path, was challenged by an outer foe rounding the turn, received right handed cues from the three path
turning into the lane, began to faded nearing the eighth pole, but held on to show. HE'S IN CHARGE was a bit rank and hopped at the start, raced off the
pace in the five path, swung out to the six path into the stretch, and finished evenly between. JOE DI BAGGIO chased in the six path but made no impact
around the seven path in the stretch. FIRECROW was prominent outside the pacesetter in the four path early, bid from the three path rounding the turn, but
weakened in the five path down the stretch. ASSERTIKO prompted the pace between foes in the three path but faded turning into the stretch. OLD TOWN
ROAD trailed in the five path early and never menaced. FRENCHMEN STREET rated in the two path but was done rounding the turn.

Footnotes
GRAND VALLEY settled off the early pace while racing four wide, tipped further out in upper stretch, closed outside and was up and clear late. FAST FIXER
came out a bit and bumped TEJOTA at the start, stalked the pace four wide, took over near the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch, drifted out late
and was swallowed up. TEJOTA was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, angled out in upper stretch, rallied outside and was bumped late.
MIDNIGHT GETAWAY raced off the pace two wide, swung out in upper stretch, rallied between foes, was herded out late and bumped with TEJOTA in
deep stretch. WHEATSHEAF pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. ON JET HEIR was bumped at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. GOTTA LIKE HIM was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. BLUE LIEUTENANT failed to menace while
racing five wide. JOYFUL SURPRISE broke a bit awkwardly, dueled two wide between foes and tired in the stretch. MIDNIGHT CHAOS dueled inside and
faltered in the lane.

BIG EFFECT broke well and travelled up close in the two path, tipped out to the three path and bid nearing the three eighths pole, took command and was
coaxed passing the quarter, and kicked away under mild encouragement through the stretch. AWESOME TRAIN chased in the five path, floated out to the
seven path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. TITAN stalked in the four path, lost ground around the turn and tipped out to the six path into the
stretch, and was along for show. VITO'S BROTHER broke in and bumped an inner foe, set the pace in the three path before crossing over to the rail into the
turn, lost the lead midway around the turn, and faded form the five path down the lane. KHOOLZAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the
three path, but had to steady passing the half, and flattened from the four path in the stretch. MAGICSHADOW got bumped by an outer foe at the start,
travelled off the pace in the two path but never threatened. ALI'I NUI broke inwards then bumped with an outer foe at the start, and always trailed from the

Footnotes
FLY THE W lacked early speed, saved ground, advanced inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, angled three wide midway around the bend,
steadily gained outside, took over near the sixteenth pole then just lasted. WIND NINETY NINE raced up close in the two path early, was in tight near the
five-eighths marker, continued to drop back under a full drive around the turn, re-bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole, surged late and just missed.
THE BEST DISTANCE set the pace in the two path, was collared nearing the five-sixteenths pole but fought on inside of foes through the lane. STARSHIP
WIZARD raced off the pace three and four wide rallied belatedly. CHAPALU steadied into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide, took the lead midway
around the far turn, led to the sixteenth pole then weakened. SOUPER LEGACY steadied early on the first turn, raced in range three and four wide and
lacked the needed rally. UNCLE ARMANDO raced two wide in midpack early, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened.

around the turn, was shaken up passing the quarter and tipped out to the six path into the stretch, and kept on but was outkicked to place. DIAMOND COOL
tracked in the four path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, shifted back out to the four path into the lane, and held show. DESERT RULER chased
in the five path, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and evened out.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S WISH settled off the early pace outside, advanced four wide around the turn, swept to the front in midstretch and powered clear under a drive.
FLAKES pressed the pace in the three path, took a narrow lead between foes in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but stayed on well to be clearly
second best. TRUST ME set the pace in the two path, yielded in upper stretch and held well enough for the show. JELLICLE KATZ hopped at the start,
raced well back four wide and improved position in the lane. PRINCIPIA chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. KIKILOVE had only brief
speed five wide. JUST MERCY trailed inside.

Footnotes
LOVE SPELL set the pace inside, opened up rapidly around the turn, continued to kick away under mild coaxing into the lane, and was wrapped up late.
SUBTLE FAITH chased in the two path, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch and kept on to secure place. DOC BALLARD tracked in the four path,
moved up under a drive turning into the stretch, but evened out for show. CASH IT was held up in midpack around the two path, fanned out to the seven
path into the lane, but made no impact. ANTILLEAN had a slow start, trailed along the inside early and did not threaten. HANDSOME TODD stalked in the
three path but backed up rounding the turn. FUN AMERICAN raced wellback in the six path and never menaced.
