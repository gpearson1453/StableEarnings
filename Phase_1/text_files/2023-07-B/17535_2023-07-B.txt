stretch long drive. AUGER close up from the start, offered a strong bid along the rail through upper stretch then couldn't handle the winner. OVER THE
HILLS vied for the lead three wide into the stretch, drifted to the six path giving up some ground then surged late in the six path and just missed getting up
for second. THE COOKIE MAN broke sharply, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened. ICON failed to menace. CUTLER had speed through

K KID stalked the pace three wide, rallied two wide on the far turn to make the lead just past the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip under
brisk handling to win as much the best. SWING STATE was bumped at the start, pressed the pace two wide around the first turn, made the lead before a
half, set the pace to the quarter pole along the inside then was no match for the winner. CAVALETTO unhurried early, closed ground quickly in the five path
into the stretch then leveled off. RED COMET moved up three wide before a half then failed to sustain that bid. YOU'RE OUT offered a mild bid four wide
after a half then came up empty. GOOD MUSIC settled inside early then two wide down the backstretch and failed to respond. SOL DEL NORTE bore in at
the start bumping SWING STATE then showed little. BIG STOCK WINNER set the early pace along the inside then faltered.
