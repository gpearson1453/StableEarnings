Footnotes
KIDYOUNOT set a clear early pace, raced three wide through the turns, opened up through the second turn, met the bid of LIFESPAN through the stretch,
dueled, re-kicked and edged clear for the win. LIFESPAN was unhurried, angled out six wide through the home turn, was gaining, made a bid on the winner,
dueled to late stretch, couldn't sustain the rally and finished second best. MELINA'S DREAM raced in mid pack early, went five wide into the second turn
and never fired. CAPE HEDGE was allowed to settle early, saved ground into the home turn, drifted out in mid stretch and offered no late rally. TAINO
followed the early pace, raced four wide through the turns and was empty.
