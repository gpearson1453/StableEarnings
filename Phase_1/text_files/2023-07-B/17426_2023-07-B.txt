Footnotes
NINETYNINECARATS broke on top then settled into stride, stalked the dueling leaders into the turn, swept to the front four wide coming to the top of the
stretch, was given just moderate urging in the late stages when willingly holding the inside rival at bay to be best. UPTOWN JIVE broke in just a bit lightly
bumping a rival and soon went to the early lead, was challenged after the opening three-sixteenths, dueled outside a foe and put to urging about the
five-sixteenths regaining the lead, was overtaken by an outside rival at the top of the stretch, fought on inside that one but was only second best. RITZ ON
BROADWAY bumped with a rival at the start, raced in the trailing group between runners moving out from two to four wide on the turn, was guided out
further in upper stretch and ran on to get show honors. TRICKY RIVER broke a step slowly after getting bumped just lightly at the start, was urged strongly
to gain forward position drawing even at the half, dueled with a narrow advantage inside a rival to the five-sixteenths, was overtaken by the outside foe past
that marker, gave way in the stretch. BOBBI TWO STEPS lacked early speed despite some urging, raced outside at the back four to five wide through the
turn, was never near enough to threaten. PRINCESS PEANUT bumped with a foe at the start, raced at the back inside, was not a threat.

Footnotes
TIZ HERSELF moved forward setting the pace from off the rail in the two to three path, was pressed briefly early up the backstretch by an outside rival,
edged clear of that one heading to the far turn, was challenged again by that same foe coming to the quarter pole, was on even terms with that one through
upper- to mid-stretch while possibly just headed, dug in to inch away late. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY was caught five wide into the first turn, moved forward
outside foes on that bend and shifted in a path, pressed the leader briefly up the backstretch, lost ground on that one, regained momentum on the far turn to
bid coming to the quarter pole, was even through mid-stretch but fended off late. MAVILUS settled off the leaders into the first turn, saved ground tracking
inside, came out a bit leaving the far turn just off the leading pair, moved out further in upper stretch, was no match for the top pair. CHALK HILL was taken
back from outside runners into the first turn shifting in to the three to four path, moved back out leaving that bend and advanced a bit up the backstretch,
was guided back nearer inside racing in the three path and ridden along three furlongs out, came out for the drive and ran on without threatening. REINA LA
KELSY chased briefly three wide through the first turn, dropped back between runners up the backstretch, faded. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL was caught four
then three wide on the first turn, raced off the pace still wide into the far turn, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
NUTELLA FELLA was very fractious in the gate, exchanged some bumps at the start and was consequently away a length slowly, moved forward willingly
between runners up the backstretch, tucked in behind the leaders racing in the two path into the turn, was guided out late on that bend and altered outside
the leader coming to the top of the stretch, took the measure of that one and was in command at the furlong marker, drew clear. LINZER got away alertly,
ceded the lead content to shadow while kept very wide to the far turn, moved in from the four to the three path early on that bend, took the lead about the
five-sixteenths and came back out turning for home, was overtaken by mid-stretch and second best. FULMINEO pursued from outside entering the turn four
deep, moved in a path on that bend racing in behind the leading trio, moved out again turning for home, was no match but best of the rest. INCHON bumped
lightly with a rival at the start, was outsprinted early, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, ran on. FINICKY bobbled and bumped with a rival at the
start, was urged to the lead, set the pace racing inside into the turn, gave way in the stretch. JIGGERY POKERY chased from between runners, shifted in a
bit but still off the fence through the turn, failed to menace. BEYOND REPROACH broke a step slowly, was urged forward to chase inside, dropped back,
came out in upper stretch, failed to rally.

ZIPPER ZAPPER set the early pace while kept off the rail in the two to three path, was pressured midway up the backstretch and overtaken by the half,
dropped back into the far turn, switched out at the five-sixteenths and began to advance again, fanned seven wide into upper stretch as leading pair drifted
out, struck the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged past. THE COLORA KID stalked off the early leaders four wide, took closer order willingly advancing
outside up the backstretch, took the lead at the half in tandem with an inside foe, dispatch that one soon after and was clear on the far turn, drifted out a
couple paths turning for home, continued out a bit further in upper stretch, was overtaken inside the final furlong, outfinished but second best. MR
BOLDACIOUS lacked early speed, was taken in hand and angled in early, saved ground through the first turn racing well back, advanced on the leaders on
the far turn passing outside a rival, was one-paced in the lane. HIS ROYAL G stalked the leader four then three wide in the early going, moved along with an
outside rival to bid between coming to the half, tried to go on with the outside one but could not, drifted out a couple paths leaving the far turn and
weakened. GABBYS BIG NOTION shifted in but off the fence heading into the first turn, raced at the back and failed to meance. IM YOUR PAPI tracked
mid-division in the three then two path in the early going, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
LAGONISI moved forward between runners into the first turn two wide, set the pace on a narrow advantage, was challenged in earnest by the inside runner
at the half, dispatched that one early on the far turn, was challenged by an outside rival coming to the quarter while drifting out turning for home, turned back
that rival and drew clear in upper stretch then was kept to the task. LOTUS CASE broke just a half-step slowly then moved forward under mild coaxing,
caught three wide among and outside the leaders into the first turn, eased back off a pair content to stalk from outside, advanced on the far turn making a
bid at the quarter pole and being floated five wide leaving that bend, could not match strides with the winner but was second best. AMORICA broke sharply,
was soon overtaken into the first turn, pressed from inside, took closer order to force the issue at the half, was dispatched early on the far turn, weakened in
continued pursuit. LADY CHA CHA raced two to three wide off the early pace, edged closer on the far turn in behind the leaders, flattened out in the drive.
URSULINE settled mid-pack inside, came out a bit for the stretch run, was never near enough to threaten. CUNDI was loaded backwards into the gate,
raced outside off the pace three wide early, was not a threat. MISS MELODRAMATIC raced at the rear off the inside and made no impact.

IRISH LACE stalked from outside travelling outside four to five wide, was within range turning for home, took the lead past the furlong marker, edged clear
under steady handling. LUNITA got away alertly and was quickly clear, set the pace racing inside but just off the rail, was challenged in mid-stretch and
outkicked but well clear of the rest. UNBRIDLED SASS was ridden along five wide on the turn, ran on evenly, held show honors. LADYNESS raced between
runners going three wide into the turn and off the leaders, angled six wide into upper stretch, drifted out several paths at that juncture, straightened out and
ran on but missed show honors. FORTIBUG switched outside the leader chasing four then three wide, came up empty. SUZY Q THE QUEEN chased from
inside briefly, was not a threat. RUBY DOOBY DOO dropped back early two wide, fanned seven wide into upper stretch, was carried out further, failed to
menace.

Footnotes
GOLDEN JUAN pressed from outside, went three to four wide on the turn, was in command by the top of the stretch, forged clear in mid-stretch and was
kept to the task. PIT STOP MAN eased back off the leaders, switched outside those stalking, went four wide on the turn, kept on to gain the place while no
threat to the winner. REBEL EMPIRE broke on top and set the pace facing pressure from the eventual winner outside, raced off the rail through the turn,
was overtaken by the top of the stretch, drifted in a bit in mid-stretch, weakened some but kept on well enough to hold show. GOLDEN CANDY was in a bit
tight in the early going racing at the back, went two wide on the turn beginning to advance mildly, came out a bit in mid-stretch, ran on and missed third.
EASY DAY was off the pace and outside early, went three to five wide throughout, ran on belatedly. TRUMPENCE chased from inside, dropped back and
faded.

Footnotes
DISCO DEVIL broke inwardly but was quick to the lead inside, set the pace on or just off the rail, turned back challengers and drew clear in upper stretch
then held sway while being kept to the task. RESPIRATOR was forwardly-positioned between runners early attending the pace two to three wide, dropped
back despite encouragement late on the turn, shifted in past the quarter pole to be on the inside at the top of the stretch, could not keep pace with the
winner but got the place. REBEL JOKE was bumped at the start, attended and pressed the pace from outside, went three to five wide throughout, lost place
late. RUSH TO CANDY bumped a rival at the start, altered outside foes and lacked early speed bringing up the rear, went four to five wide on the turn, came
out further for the drive, ran on mildly. NATURE OFTHE BEAST lacked early speed racing inside a foe at the back, went two to three wide on the turn, came
out for the drive and ran on. SAGAMOOSE was well-placed mid-pack inside on or just off the rail, failed to rally. FINN'S POINT broke well but quickly
dropped back, raced three to four wide through the turn, was outrun.
