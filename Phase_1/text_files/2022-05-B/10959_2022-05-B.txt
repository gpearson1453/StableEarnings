Footnotes
COMPLETE SURPRISE took quick control of the pace then moved to the inside entering the first turn, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
opened up at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the lane. LADY MACHO raced apprehensively in hand near the rail through the front
stretch, checked off the heels of Complete Surprise into the first turn and raced boxed in through the turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths
pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and couldn't improve in the stretch. CHINA CAT stalked from the three path on the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn two deep then flattened in the lane. TEQUILA FOG settled off the early pace toward the inside, eased out into the
backstretch and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, then flattened in the three path of the far turn. ANNA ROCKS came away awkwardly and
rounded the opening turn about the four path, though, showed little response past the half mile pole.

Footnotes
OCEAN LILLY saved early ground, bid leaving the three eighths pole and ran in the three path of the far turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch then dueled
clear later yards. LADY MADISON steadied from tight quarters early then settled inside, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out leaving the turn and
finished well to take second the final strides. NICE N' BROAD became a bit edgy in the gate and hopped at the break, stalked the early pace two deep,
moved to even terms nearing the nine sixteenths pole and dueled from the three eighths, contested the edge two deep on the far turn, gave up the nod into
the stretch but ran close to mid-stretch before flattening stride. GRACE ELIZABETH settled off the early pace about the three path then eased outward into
the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and passed some rivals widest. SECRET CASTLE
settled in the two and three paths the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path then flattened stride.
SUZYSELLSSEASHELLS set the early pace inside, was met at the nine sixteenths pole, dueled leaving the three eighths and rounded the far turn nearest
the rail, was caught mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. JAMESTOWN ROAD stalked the early pace three wide, moved to even terms at the three
eighths pole and dueled from that point, ran in the four path of the far turn then weakened.
