Footnotes
MINING CHROME raced three wide off the pace, chased two wide on the far turn, rallied outside in the stretch run, dug in gamely in deep stretch, surged
outside and got the nod on the wire. VALUABLE BREIGH was bumped at the start, set the pace on the inside, shook free on the far turn, dug in gamely in
the final furlong and lost a narrow decision on the wire. ALONG THE WAY raced four wide early, settled two wide off the pace, moved up entering the
stretch and closed late for third. SUDDEN IMPULSE tracked on the inside, contested the pace on the rail at the half mile marker, was shuffled back nearing
the far turn and rallied mildly inside in the lane. MAARTY'S DILEMMA trailed the field, moved up four wide at the quarter pole, then failed to rally. IMAGINE
THE MOJO stalked two wide, chased inside on the far turn and tired. BLIND SIGHT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside and did not factor.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY GHOST was bumped at the start, trailed the field, made a four wide run on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, closed willingly outside,
ran up alongside of WINFROMWITHIN at the sixteenth marker, dueled and prevailed. WINFROMWITHIN dueled inside in a three way early pace dispute,
dueled with MID DAY IMAGE on the backside, battled on the far turn, raced in the two path into the stretch, dug in gamely inside in the final furlong, dueled
with the winner and then yielded grudgingly. ANALYZE IT was bumped at the start, settled off the pace inside, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the
rail in the stretch and got the nod for third. YES THIS TIME raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied mildly between horses
in the stretch run and just missed for the show spot. OCEANS MAP raced off the pace, trailed the field on the far turn, went three wide at the quarter pole
and rallied mildly outside in the lane. CARPENTERS CALL dueled between rivals for the early lead, then stalked the pace, bid three wide on the far turn,
dueled and weakened. MOHS raced three wide off the pace, bid four wide on the far turn, dueled and faded. KING OF DREAMS tracked on the inside,
chased between rivals on the far turn and faded. MID DAY IMAGE dueled three wide for the early lead, then dueled two wide and faded.
