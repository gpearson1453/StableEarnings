Footnotes
SUPER SILVER was squeezed and checked back after the break, advanced inside, found himself boxed in from the half mile marker to the quarter pole,
altered out five wide leaving the second bend, responded to mostly hand urging and drew away from the rest the final furlong. DANG IT CASSIE was
bumped shortly after the start, kept close between horses, went for the lead four wide on the second turn, was no match for SUPER SILVER in the lane but
pulled away for second the last sixteenth. ANTRIM'S GIANT progressed from outside to vie for the lead three wide between horses on the second bend,
fought for second after SUPER SILVER took over upper stretch, was in tight between CHERNYAHOVSKIY and DANG IT CASSIE inside the last eighth and
slowly yielded. CHERNYAHOVSKIY broke inward, squeezing SUPER SILVER and bumping DANG IT CASSIE, shared the lead from inside, retreated some
after a half mile, came again along the rail approaching the quarter mile marker, battled for second in the lane but yielded deep stretch. AMERICAN
SUCCESS soon trailed, came into contention along the rail on the second bend, angled out the final sixteenth but lacked a significant response. SHOBIZ
STAR displayed early speed between foes for six furlongs then gave way.

TWO WORLDS rated at the back, was let out into the bend, swung four wide into the lane, gradually angled out to stay clear of YOU'RE IN COREY as he
rallied under steady urging and began to draw away the final sixteenth. YOU'RE IN COREY shared the lead outside rivals, moved clear and stayed off the
inside on the turn, gradually drifted out under left-handed pressure through the stretch and proved easily second best. PRINCE OF MAYHEM was hustled to
dispute the pace between foes, did not stay with YOU'RE IN COREY on the turn and gave way for the drive. MAJESTIC ATTACK displayed early speed
from inside, also retreated some on the bend then gave way upper stretch and was allowed to coast the last eighth.

BONNIE DANCES pressed SANGFROID from outside, went for the lead on the bend, was bumped by the latter at the top of the lane, all out inside the last
furlong and moved clear late. SANGFROID soon had the lead, showing the way just off the inside, was challenged on the turn, drifted out a bit to bump
BONNIE DANCES once straightened for the drive and slowly wore down the last sixteenth. LOW TIDE WARNING forwardly placed, lost ground widest
through the bend, rallied belatedly the final eighth but caught EL ROMANTICO for third. EL ROMANTICO in contention early, failed to keep up just off the
inside on the turn, altered out to path four upper stretch for racing room, gradually closed the gap on the leaders but was too late. THACKER FROMM
progressed three wide on the bend, drifted out to path five entering the lane and could only make up minor ground the final furlong. TEARS ON A RIVER
bumped with WAVE THE GOLD after the break, was prominent from inside on the backstretch but yielded after three furlongs. WAVE THE GOLD was a
brief factor, gave way after two furlongs, did not respond to urging in the stretch and was in hand the last seventy yards.

PRINCESS MANDII pressed from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, floated out some into the lane, edged ahead and held off TOUCH BY FELICTY
under steady handling. TOUCH BY FELICTY prominent just off the inside, waited for room on the bend, got through between rivals in path three entering
the stretch, fought gamely but had to settle for second best. HEART OF REASON fractious in the gate, took the early lead when the race began, showed
the way just off the inside, was challenged in the lane and gradually wore down. TWO MORE TIMES forwardly placed behind horses, gained a clear path
and progressed four wide on the turn, lost further ground fanning out into the lane and also slowly yielded. TIME BREAK raced in contention from outside,
did not keep up from path four on the bend, regained a striking position upper stretch but leveled off the last eighth. MIKE'S LADY pressed from inside on
the backstretch but faded on the turn.

Footnotes
WALKER'S WIN outrun from inside, though hustled along early, was altered out midway on the backstretch, came to the leader from outside on the bend,
took over leaving the turn, floated out some upper stretch, widened command under a drive then was ridden out the final sixteenth. SNOOZER bumped at
the break, quickly recovered to gain a clear lead, was challenged from outside on the turn, no match for WALKER'S WIN when set down for the drive, began
to wear down the last furlong but lasted for the place. AFTER MY BROTHER was crowded and angled to the inside at the start, chased inside BRIANS
WAY, bumped with the latter trying to gain a clear path leaving the quarter pole then showed a willingness to run from path three in the stretch. BRIANS
WAY chased from outside, closed the gap some from path three on the turn, was bumped and forced out leaving the bend and flattened for the drive. GALLI
ATTACK prominent outside SNOOZER, began to yield on the turn, quit in the lane and was allowed to coast and float out inside the final furlong.
DARREN'S LEGACY broke inward, bumping SNOOZER, trailed and did not respond to urging in the stretch.

Footnotes
LICHITA broke on top, steadily angled in leaving the chute, shared the lead outside HIDENSEEK SALLY, moved ahead on the turn, floated out some into
the lane, slowly drifted out despite right-handed pressure but drew off the last furlong. SACRED STORM altered in trying to avoid LICHITA at the end of the
first sixteenth, jostled briefly with PLAY TWENTY, advanced from outside on the bend, came into the stretch from path five, angled in for racing room upper
stretch and again inside the final eighth, was all out and caught PLAY TWENTY for second. PLAY TWENTY broke inward, was jostled behind traffic and
checked at the end of the first sixteenth of a mile, made her bid on the turn, loomed a threat outside LICHITA to the furlong marker then leveled off.
HIDENSEEK SALLY displayed early speed from inside but began to yield before finishing four furlongs. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN broke well but soon retreated,
stayed well off the inside and had no late bid. LOUIE P was steadied when crowded b PLAY TWENTY at the break and showed little. There was a stewards'
inquiry into SACRED STORM'S and PLAY TWENTY'S loss of action early in the race. After their review, LICHITA was disqualified for coming in without
being clear of her rivals and placed third.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD SICILIAN broke alertly and was quickly clear of the others while in hand, challenged from outside nearing the end of the first two furlongs,
roused from just off the rail approaching the quarter pole, floated out as he regained the lead into the stretch, moved clear under urging, began to wear
down in the waning yards but held off FULL MAGAZINE under steady handling. FULL MAGAZINE engaged WILDWOOD SICILIAN from outside
approaching the half mile marker, edged ahead on the bend, drifted out to the middle of the track entering the lane, was all out, came up short but was
easily second best. LONESOME DREAM raced in the second flight while toward the outside on the backstretch, took over third three wide on the turn,
fanned out some for the stretch run then could only hold his position. CINDY'S G MAN raced in contention from outside, moved to the inside nearing the
bend, did not keep up trough the turn and lacked a stretch bid. DR. LIECHTY prominent between horses on the backstretch, began to yield two wide on the
turn, floated out to path five for the stretch run and gave way. BUMPTYBUMPBUMP broke with the rest but was soon trailed, steadily faded from the rest,
distanced himself in the lane and was walked off after the race.
