RAYO COLORADO sprinted to a clear lead early, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, dueled through the lane edging ahead, then drove
clear late and lasted. BAHAMIAN PARK allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the stretch, made a steady
gain and missed. NO DRAMA mid pack and outside, gained position into the second turn, gained a short lead through the turn, dueled with the winner in the
lane and weakened late. SILVER TOKEN rated back in the early going, moved up on the two path through the second turn, fanned widest into the lane and
ran evenly. EL DUQUE passed a tiring rival. BOAT WAMPUM rated close up and off the rail, lost some ground through the second turn and weakened in
the stretch.

leader into the stretch, gained a short lead, then drove clear late and held. COUNTY COURT allowed to settle, angled out and gained position three wide
through the second turn, then was no match for the winner late, while clearly best of the rest. CLOONTIA sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start,
remained unchallenged to the lane, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. DAHOG tracked the pace, angled widest into the stretch and ran
evenly. C THE KING well placed and outside, held position through the second turn and faded into the stretch. SHAKEDOWN was no factor.

pressure. MERINO WOOL mid pack, moved up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and missed. DANCE
OR STROLL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and flattened out the final furlong. DATA
PRINCESS allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out at the furlong marker and edged up
for a share. ROLLING MO allowed to settle, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane and had a mild gian. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY
set the pace just off the rail, shook clear into the turn, then faded the final furlong. D DAWG stalked the pace on the outside, held position three wide through
the turn, checked slightly into the stretch angled in and could not gain. EMERALD CITADELLE mid pack, looped four wide through the turn, fanned widest
into the stretch and had no rally. LADY MARVEL well placed and off the rail, lost some ground three wide through the turn and faded into the stretch.
