CATFISH CHARLIE stalked leader two wide in a comfortable spot on the backstretch, continued along two wide on the turn, entered stretch taking aim three
wide, responded to urging and got up at the wire in a game effort. ABADON vied two wide on the backstretch, continued to hound leader on the turn,
entered stretch in range, responded well to urging mid stretch and dueled with outside rallying rival in final sixteenth and missed. AUTISM ABILITY bumped
outside rival at the start, away well and led along the inside on the backstretch, continued to lead on the turn and into the stretch, battled with rallying rivals
and gave way late for a game third place finish. INNATE bumped by inside rival at the start, stalked the leading pair along the inside on the backstretch,
continued to sit a good trip through the turn and failed to launch a threatening bid when asked. NO MALICE settled off the pace along the inside on the
backstretch, continued to trail along the inside through the turn and failed to threaten in the lane.

UP FOR EVERYTHING bumped by rival at the start, drifted in a path, asked right handed, responded and finished well to be best. INVITED broke in, quickly
corrected, under a steady drive throughout in a solid effort. LET THE INTEREST FLY tad awkward beginning, bumped inside rival at the start, asked and
responded, getting outfinished late and just held third. WHO KARES fidgety in the gate, came in at the start, asked left handed, seemed to be looking
around and finished with interest, galloped out with energy in a solid learning debut. FUSITO away cleanly but took an awkward step in second jump, lost
momentum and lugged in two paths, asked left handed, straightened out, and took a awkward step nearing wire. PARTY LINES broke a bit slow, came in
two paths at the start, never got into a fluid stride while under a hand ride.
