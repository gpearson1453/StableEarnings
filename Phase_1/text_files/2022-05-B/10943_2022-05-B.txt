furlong grounds to prove best under a drive. LANA was taken back early, advanced on the outside on the far turn, came six wide into the lane and rallied
well to be clearly second best. MIA ANGELINA tracked the pace four wide on the backstretch, made a four to three wide bid on the turn and flattened out,
bested rest. WICKED SOLUTION set the pace while in the three path and was headed on the turn and weakened the final furlong. BEST CAUSE was well

NORTHERN CROSS was reluctant to load, sent to the lead and crossed over to the inside to set the early pace, dawdled along and was well handled on
the front end, was sent down leaving the turn and drew off to prove much the best under mild urging. THROMBOCYTOPENIA stalked the pace three wide
and proved to be no match for the front runner while clearly second best. TROPICALDEPRESSION was rated along thee to four wide and had no rally,
bested rest. BROOKLYN MOJO tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. SMART TART was reserved early, advanced four wide on the far turn and
then tired in the drive.

FAVORITE DOLL was well placed on the inside throughout, was blocked by the three sixteenths and angled out for racing room by the furlong marker, then
was bumped soundly by the sixteenth marker, then edged clear late to prove best, driving. ARCTICA vied for the early lead on the inside, then made a bid
on the far turn and edged clear leaving the turn, then shifted off the inside in the furlong grounds and bumped the winner by the sixteenth pole and was
outfinished late, second best. HONESTA chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the far turn and then was empty, bested rest. SEEKING THE
THRONE was washy in the post parade, vied for the early lead three wide, made a bid to set the pace on the backstretch and tired on the turn. PRESTO
CHANGE O showed little. The jockey on ARCTICA claimed foul against the rider on FAVORITE DOLL for alleged interference in the furlong grounds, after
the Stewards reviewed the replays the race was left as is.
