Footnotes
DOUBLE DOT rated back in the early going, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and was put to the task the
final furlong, drawing off. SCOOP THERE IT IS set the pace off the rail, stayed on when challenged down the backstretch, moved up inside through the
second turn to regain sway, then drifted in inside the furlong marker and was no match. LAUGH IT OFF mid pack, looped up three and four wide through the
second turn, bid four wide into the lane and flattened out. KEEP SCROLLING rated close up and inside, dropped back down the backstretch, moved up
again on the two path through the second turn, bid on that path and weakened the final furlong. MS BOOMBASTIC allowed to settle, looped four and five
wide through the second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and passed a tiring foe. LIKEHAIL stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to take command
and drew off down the backstretch, then faded through the second turn.

CRACKIN MISCHIEF tracked the pace well back, moved up inside through the second turn, angled out to bid between rivals into the stretch, shook clear,
then drew off and was kept to the task. LOVELY EVER AFTER allowed to settle, angled out through the second turn, came widest into the stretch and
closed for the place. SILVER SEA mid pack, moved up on the two path through the second turn, angled in in the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick.
CORNICE TRAVERSE bumped and pinched back at the start, looped up four wide through the second turn, bid on that path into the lane and weakened the
final furlong. BEYOND THE HYPE well placed and outside, gained position three wide through the second turn, then faded into the stretch. RAW HONEY
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then faded in the lane.

P H FACTOR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off under mild pressure. PERFECTLY
MAJESTIC stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane, then was no match for that one, while clearly best of the rest. KING OF
THE RING hard to rate through the first turn, tracked the pace, saved ground through the second turn, came through inside of rivals and edged up for the
show. ZERO GRAVITY allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the stretch, weakened and
missed the show. NAMARUNU (GER) allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the second turn, bid on that path and faded in the lane. SAINT
SCOTTY was never involved.

clear late. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held sway without challenge, then was no match for the winner the final
furlong and held the place safe. CASCADE PARK well placed, moved up on the two path through the second turn, came through on that path into the
stretch and lacked the needed late kick. RUNAWAY MOM allowed to settle, saved ground through the turns, came through inside into the stretch and closed
for a share. TWO SOCKS (IRE) ran evenly for three quarters and had no stretch rally. ELLE M'A SOURI (FR) stalked the pace on the outside and faded

a short lead down the backstretch, stayed on when challenged through the second turn, then weakened the final furlong. TRAFFIC THIEF tracked the pace
