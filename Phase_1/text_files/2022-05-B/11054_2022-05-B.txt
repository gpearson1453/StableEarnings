CENTRE COURT CHAMP alternated for the lead outside, shook clear into the stretch then edged away in a moderate drive. SAPPHIRE ROYALTY
engaged in a heated duel along the rail and continued gamely while no match. ESPERNSITA saved ground off the leaders and continued willingly for the
show. ILKNUR steadied trying to split rivals in the opening furlong and rallied mildly. VANQUISHER chased very wide throughout and lacked a rally. CAUSE
I SAID moved between rivals on the turn then faltered. MAZAL EIGHTEEN dropped far behind and lost contact with her field.
