Footnotes
BECCA'S BOUQUET broke with the leaders, narrowly set the pace up the backstretch along the inside, clear in the turn, extended that advantage steadily
through the stretch under firm handling. SANDY'S WAGER lacked speed outside, came widest for the drive, rallied midtrack to be clear for the second spot,
no threat to the winner. MAVE RUNNER pressed the winner outside, chased through the turn, proved no match in the drive, caught for the place, saved the
show. SLEWPY'S HALO broke to the outside, raced behind the two leaders for a half outside, came up empty for the stretch run. TAY TAY'S BABY raced in
mid pack early, also lacked a closing response through the lane. TIME TO SLEEP last to leave, failed to menace. OUR STARLET was finished early, well
back at the wire.

Footnotes
A G'S CHARLOTTE broke back, tracked the pace inside, continued to save ground through the second turn and into the straight, got through when
challenging along the rail a furlong out, edged clear under steady handling. ABSOLUTELY closest to the leader, challenged outside that rival turning for
home, briefly held a narrow advantage just before the furlong marker when dueling with the winner on the outside, could not keep pace with that one to the
wire, clear of the rest. ANNA CLAUSE settled off the pace and the inside, moved closer with a mild bid three wide turning for home, flattened out the final
furlong. BURNING DESIRE off a step slow, trailed most of the way and did not threaten. LIL ADEAU broke on top, set the pace, allowed the winner the
inside when beginning to weaken when headed into the straight, continued to give way to trail home late.

the stretch to be up late. BITSY'S CUSTOM C back off the pace and the inside, challenged between, vied, outkicked in the late going. JACKIE MOON
pressed the issue early off the inside, moved up to duel through the turn, held the advantage a furlong out but could not contain the top two. HOTPIN within
striking distance for almost four furlongs, had little left the final furlong. CARLOS PUNCH moved up to show the way up the backstretch after the start,
dueled through the turn while remaining closest to the inside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
WHEELS in the second flight for a quarter along the inside, steered out for the drive, challenged on the outside past the furlong marker, hard drive to the
wire, proved best in determined fashion. EYE DEE KAY void of speed while saving ground, angled to the outside entering the straight, set down, late run to
be up for the place and to be getting to the winner outside that one in the final strides. KAHAAL broke in good order, dueled up front off the inside, continued
to do battle while holding a slim advantage with a furlong to run, proved no match for the late runs of the top two, managed to save the show. SINGLE
SHOT back off the pace while racing outside, four wide exiting the turn, improved position a bit out in the middle of the course with some mild late interest.
SHARP CHARLIE broke on top, set or forced the pace in dueling closest to the inside for a half, first to cave inside the furlong grounds. ORGERON chased
the dueling leaders leaders up the backstretch, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
COMMON LAW CAT broke behind trouble, moved up to press the issue off the inside, fell back slightly late in the turn between horsed, roused once in
upper stretch, ground on resolutely to be up in game fashion between the two leaders at the wire. SIR SMACK bore in for several strides after the start
forcing HIGH CRUISE into the gap and bothering that foe, failed to correct mount in a timely manner causing that same rival to check up in tight along the
inner rail, set the pace inside, responded when challenged into the lane, proved stubborn to the end. HIGH CRUISE pushed into the gap just after the start,
steadied repeatedly then was forced to check up in tight along the rail early backstretch, moved out, four wide bid turn, long drive outside, not enough in the
late going. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR forwardly placed up the backstretch three wide, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. YES BAB fell back to trail
after the start, showed little in a dull effort. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN OUT OF THE GATE, SIR SMACK WAS
DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND WAS PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
KATIE'S KARAT allowed the pace to go early, stalked the leader firmly in hand in the run up the backstretch, moved closer far turn, took over into the lane,
held the runner up at bay the length of the stretch in game fashion to prevail. COLD HEARTED WENCH settled off the pace and the inside, ranged up to
challenge three wide exiting the final turn, hounded the winner from the outside through the lane, could not get by while remaining clear for the place. MY
LITTLE JEN raced in mid pack while outside, remained well out in the course in the run up the backstretch, came four wide out of the final turn, mild rally to
be slowly getting to the top pair late. SAVVY SHIPMAN void of speed, crept closer late in the final turn, improved in the two path to be closest to the top two
a furlong outside, made little further progress and was caught for the show spot. SAND DRIFT broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn,
clear in the run up the backstretch, gave way readily when headed into the straight. C. F. SHELAUH last to leave, remained back in failing to threaten.
PODCAST chased the leader for just under a half and began to fade.

COURTMAN closest to the leader off the inside, advanced and collared that foe in the second turn, clear into the lane, maintained a comfortable advantage
to the wire under steady handling. JIMMIE'S HALO lacked speed, outside, four wide turning for home, rallied to be up late for the place, no real threat to the
winner. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN settled off the pace while saving ground, closer into the far turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, no match for
that one, could not contain JIMMIE'S HALO for the second spot. LUCK OF THE STARS took over soon after the start, clear first turn, continued to show the
way the middle half, weakened when headed by the winner late in the final turn. COLE'S SENSATION four wide in the first turn when back off the pace,
continued outside, weakened for the drive. PURPLE ICICLE fell back to trail after the start, never involved in showing little.

Footnotes
SPLENDA GAIL broke in and bumped CYPRESS QUEEN to off a step slow, raced back off the pace and the inside, swung out five wide turning for home,
finished full of run down the middle of the course to win going away as much the best. IRONIT balked loading, in mid pack while off the inside, roused four
wide into the lane, challenged a furlong out, drifted in to bother VIV VIV VIV with a sixteenth remaining, proved no match for the winner, clear for the place.
MADAME JANE dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate through the turn, held a slight advantage a furlong out, could not contain the top
two while weakening then came in a sixteenth out, saved the show spot. VIV VIV VIV broke well, closest to the dueling leaders, bid, evenly in traffic
midstretch, bothered, steadied nearing the sixteenth marker, continued evenly after recovering to the finish. TAYLORS BABE broke out and toward the
back, raced outside, continued four wide turn, improved a bit late with some moderate late interest out in the course. CYPRESS QUEEN back off the pace
inside, continued to save ground, floated into the gap with a sixteenth remaining, did not recover. BRINEE dueled up front in the two path, first to blink
approaching the furlong marker, continued to weaken to lose several positions. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH
DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF VIV VIV VIV AGAINST IRONIT FOR INTERFERENCE WITH A SIXTEENTH REMAINING,
THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
POWER JET broke with the leaders outside, dropped toward the inside to save ground first turn, crept closer in traffic in the second turn just off the inside,
continued inside entering the stretch, squeezed through along the rail to challenge nearing the furlong grounds, extended drive to the wire, proved narrowly
best. SUCH broke on top, set the pace off the inside, continued to show the way in the two path into and through the far turn, allowed the winner the inside
in upper stretch, gave ground grudgingly to that rival. DEALIN' STELEN lacked early foot, moved closer before a half, within striking distance three wide
turning for home, outside bid a furlong out, outkicked by the top two to the wire. PURIM KING last away, trailed early, four wide second turn, steadied as a
rival was falling midway on the final turn, went evenly through the stretch. WITCH DOCTOR void of speed, steadied when avoiding a fallen foe midway on
the final turn, did not recover. KRAFTY BOY chased the runner up early, was continuing in the second flight along the inside when taken up in traffic midway
on the final turn, jogged in. QUALITY PRODUCTION in the second flight off the inside, between foes far turn, appeared to clip heels soon after, fell,
unseated rider, vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE FINAL TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF KRAFTY BOY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THAT SAME JUNCTURE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
