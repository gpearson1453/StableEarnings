Footnotes
THE GREAT DANSKY stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, floated to the four path turning for home, closed steadily and was up at the wire. HERE
WEGO showed speed along the rail, dropped back on the turn while attempting to drift out, moved over to the two path turning for home, led late between
rivals and was nipped. DEGAS sprinted clear mid way on the turn, angled to the inner rail entering the stretch, weakened and switched to his left lead late.
CONFUSION BABY BOY saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, eased out for the drive and came up empty. JUST PICK ONE hugged the inner rail
around the turn and was not a factor. LITTLE BOLD BANDIT broke awkwardly, was outrun and drifted to the five path turning for home.

Footnotes
CUENCA rated early while saving ground, eased out near the half mile marker, took closer order three wide past the five sixteenths, shifted out in upper
stretch, closed in under left handed asking, overtook SMART EULEE leaving the sixteenth marker and drew clear. SMART EULEE pulled her way forward
while outside rivals and kicked clear leaving the three quarter pole, dropped in and set the pace, handled an initial challenge near the quarter pole, kicked
back clear leaving the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted inside the furlong grounds then gave way grudgingly. BEAUCOUP BELL saved ground
early, angled out around the final turn, came four wide for the drive and rallied mildly. INDIA CARIBE prompted the early pace two wide, shifted in leaving
the far turn, gave hard chase while saving ground in the lane but came up empty. TANKA TOUGH , rank through the opening three sixteenths, settled off
the rail into the backstretch, bid outside SMART EULEE leaving the five sixteenths, forced the issue to mid stretch then faded. MS KAYS COWGIRL failed
to menace. CAGED PIXIE disputed the early pace while saving ground, stalked the leader leaving the three quarter pole, stayed on to the far turn then
dropped back.

Footnotes
LARAMORE , fractious during the post parade, was reluctant to load into the starting gate, showed speed between horses, bumped COCKTAIL DREAMING
when bumped and forced in by MIDNIGHT REVENGE leaving the backstretch, raced in the three path turning for home, gained the lead in upper stretch
and prevailed under brisk urging. VALDIKAVA showed speed along the inner rail, was checked when soundly bumped entering the turn, steadied waiting for
room mid way on the turn, advanced along the inner rail through the stretch in a game performance. COCKTAIL DREAMING stumbled leaving the starting
gate, bumped VALDIKAVA when bumped and forced in by LARAMORE entering the turn, angled to the four path for the drive and flattened out. GALACTIC
TIDE circled horses on the turn, floated to the five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. MIDNIGHT REVENGE , outside horses down the backstretch,
caused a chain reaction when drifting in and bumping the winner entering the turn, opened a clear advantage mid way on the turn, raced in the two path in
the stretch and faltered. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the run down the backstretch but no action was taken.

Footnotes
OLDIES BUT GOODIES rated close up while saving ground and covered up, eased out into the lane, responded to left handed asking and bid between foes
nearing the eighth pole, took command soon after and kicked away while kept to task. STORM BOARDER (CHI) sped clear early, dropped in and set the
pace, ceded command with a furlong to go, gave way grudgingly and narrowly saved the place. W W SPRINGTIME chased two wide outside the winner,
shifted three wide into the lane, remained on his left lead and kept on with interest. RAILMASTER , two wide leaving the far turn, angled four wide for the
drive but lacked a rally. DEMO DOCTOR , off the pace while saving ground, continued inside into the lane but ailed to generate a solid run. NOBLE
COMMANDER , four wide under coaxing into the turn, dropped in some and failed to respond. MAINE , three wide pursuing the early pace, came a bit wider
for the drive and gave way.

angled out inside the eighth pole and rallied between the top pair. RAN CHAR , three wide on the turn, chased the pace and failed to rally in an even effort.
GOLD TIME VIXEN , no factor, drifted four wide leaving the turn. GRACE ISABELLA , along the inner rail on the turn, swung to the three path approaching

Footnotes
FERMAT , in a bit tight at the break, settled well back while off the rail, came under pressure three wide leaving the far turn, moved up between foes into the
lane, shifted out a bit, leveled off under solid handling past the furlong grounds, kept on relentlessly and surged outside rivals to be along in time. XY TIME
cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was under asking to hold position into the lane, dug in when confronted in mid stretch, spurted back away a
bit, kept on valiantly but just failed to fend off the winner's charge. ROBERT'S LUXURY tracked the pace setter while two to three wide, moved up to
challenge in upper stretch, dueled on near even terms past the eighth pole but was out kicked in the final yards. MINT GAME , three wide in a good spot,
moved up leaving mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. ULTIMATE IRONY , towards the inside early on, eased out some around the final turn, shifted
back in some near the three sixteenths, moved up past the eighth pole then flattened out late. MR. D'ANGELO lagged back, raced two wide leaving the far
turn, angled out four wide for the drive and had late action. READY REWARD , three wide early, circled five wide into the lane but came up empty. BUGLE
OF WAR , well placed inside, came under pressure leaving the far turn, failed to seriously kick on and faded in the drive. REASSURED , off the pace, saved
ground into the lane but failed to menace. AXXERATOR , three to four wide chasing the pace, remained in range to the quarter pole then gave way.

MAUREENLOVESFRANK stalked the pace, circled the turn, was four deep entering the stretch, brushed with LITTLE MS SCARLET in upper stretch and
drifted in near the sixteenth pole when sprinting clear. LITTLE MS SCARLET , three wide on the turn chasing the pace, brushed with the winner in upper
stretch, swung out in mid stretch and rallied. DEVILISH AFFAIR , alertly steered to the inner rail mid way down the backstretch, hugged the rail thereafter,
had aim on the lead in mid stretch and gave way. SHACKABOOM sprinted clear early, raced in the two path in the stretch and gave way the final furlong. An
objection by the rider of LITTLE MS SCARLEET against the winner for alleged interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
DAILY PLANET drifted out at the break and bumped with a rival, dropped in soon after and was taken well in hand, eased out near the far turn, took closer
order while confidently handled past the five sixteenths, shifted out to be five wide entering the lane, surged clear past the three sixteenths and widened
while kept to task. AMARETTO SOUR saved ground under some rating, swung out six wide for the drive and kept on willingly to edge FOXTROT SEVILLE
for the place. FOXTROT SEVILLE , four wide into the first turn, dropped in heading to the half mile marker, edged up then had some traffic in upper stretch,
shifted out and kept on with interest. POST BOX tracked inside, eased out nearing the far turn and went after the leader, gained a slim lead dueling past the
three eighths, was no match for the winner heading to mid stretch and weakened. BLAME THE IRISH stalked three wide, steadily advanced mid way on the
final turn, failed to kick on with the leaders heading past the three sixteenths and weakened. SINGALONG , pinched back at the break, lagged well back
while saving ground, angled out and had belated interest. LIKE N' EAGLE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, was joined into the far turn, battled
past the three eighths then gave way in upper stretch. KITTEN'S BLESSING bobbled inward at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and pursued
early, failed to kick on after five furlongs, faltered and was eased late.
