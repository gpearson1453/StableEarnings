Footnotes
OUR SHOT stalked the pace down the backstretch, circled the turn four wide, closed determinedly outside horses and was up approaching the finish.
DETROIT CITY sped to the early lead, opened up leaving the turn, was well clear in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. PRINCE PERE , a forward factor
in the two path around the turn, chased the pace inside horses and steadied in traffic leaving the furlong pole. BACKNTHEWOODS , swung very wide in
upper stretch, passed tired horses. HARD TO BE HUMBLE , three wide chasing the pace to mid stretch, weakened. KOBE TOUGH lacked speed, swung
wide turning for home and passed tired foes. BILLINGSGATE , along the inner rail on the turn, raced between horses in the stretch and failed to rally.
FOMO was no factor inside horses. LANTAU prompted the pace outside DETROIT CITY and weakened. BLACK LIGHT , wide on the turn, lacked a rally.
NEVER SATISFIED , bumped at the start, was no factor. MOCEPHUS was not a factor. DATHOSS chased the pace inside horses and gave way. CREDIT
RIVER bumped NEVER SATISFIED when bearing in at the break, was checked soon after then trailed.

Footnotes
RUN RAEGAN RUN sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail while under a light hold, spurted away a bit entering the lane, responded when set down
near the three sixteenths then dug in tenaciously under solid handling to prevail. SAINT EROS GIRL , off slowly, regrouped and edged up inside while under
rating, exchanged a solid bump with PRACTICALLY THERE nearing the turn, tracked inside past the five sixteenths, eased out for room into the lane,
ranged up outside the winner leaving mid stretch, sustained a grinding run under a strong ride but had her surge fall just short. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS
stalked the pace three wide, was fanned four wide under pressure into the lane but came up empty through the final furlong. FOUL BALLS drifted in at the
break, corrected and prompted the pace outside the winner, failed to kick on while three wide soon into the lane and gave way. PRACTICALLY THERE
forced in a bit at the break, raced forwardly outside a rival near the half, bumped with SAINT EROS GIRL soon after, dropped back past the five sixteenths
then lacked a stretch response after angling out.

NEVER EXPLAIN stalked the pace in the two path down the backstretch and on the far turn, secured command entering the stretch, opened a clear lead in
mid stretch then dug in late. ROYNE , patiently rated near the inner rail down the backstretch, moved over to the two path leaving the far turn and rallied
gamely near the inner rail. KING VEGA (GB) , bumped by EXTRA MEDIUM at the start, bumped UNDERCOVER KITTY and was rank entering the first turn,
circled both turns three wide, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out. UNDERCOVER KITTY , bumped entering the first turn, was four deep on
both turn, made a mild advance to mid stretch and lacked the necessary rally. GREAT IDEA , in hand early, raced three wide the first turn, four wide the far
turn and passed tired foes. EXTRA MEDIUM bumped KING VEGA at the break, raced near the inner rail, drifted out in mid stretch bumping ARTISTIC
ENDEAVOR then failed to rally. ARTISTIC ENDEAVOR , rank between horses mid way down the backstretch, was bumped in mid stretch. SEA GHOST ,
along the inner rail on the far turn, was not a factor. PHARAOH'S TRIUMPH , snugly rated early, failed to be a factor and swung very wide in upper stretch.
LET ME FINISH set the pace along the inner rail and faltered entering the stretch. THE HONORABLE ONE dropped back entering the far turn, was eased
and walked off.

five sixteenths, responded and opened up when roused two wide in upper stretch then continued to increase his advantage while kept to strong handling.
MAJESTIC FRONTIER settled within range while saving ground, angled out past the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, drifted in towards the rail
advancing past mid stretch, kept on with effort and held down the place. AFFABLE MONARCH was steadied off heels into the first turn, dropped in to move
up into the backstretch, angled back out and raced four wide pursuing into the turn, angled out further to be about six wide into the lane, raced on his left
lead and churned on. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY , bumped at the break, moved up and stalked the winner two wide, was under pressure past the five
sixteenths, brushed with a rival when giving futile chase in mid stretch then faded. NATAGAR , off slowly, regrouped soon after then angled three wide and
was used to reach contention near the seven eighths, stalked three wide through the backstretch run, gave hard chase four wide in upper stretch, drifted in
and brushed with a foe near mid stretch, steadied briefly and came up empty. GALLANT GOLD , floated out some into the first turn, angled in, was under a
ride saving ground into the far turn then gave way. HEFFNER , six wide early, lost ground four wide past the half mile marker and weakened. SHADY
MUNNI was steadied when in close into the first turn, lost ground five wide past the three quarter pole and faltered. An objection by the rider of NATAGAR

COMEDY TOWN , two wide chasing the pace around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted in in front of W W SPRINGTIME when going clear
approaching the sixteenth pole and held sway under brisk urging. RADICAL RIGHT lacked speed, eased out to the five path in upper stretch and rallied
outside horses. LOVE YOU MUCH , rated early, was taken to the four path in upper stretch and rallied between horses. W W SPRINGTIME set the pace
near the inner rail around the turn, lost the lead in mid stretch and weakened. TOMMY SHELBY worked between horses in the stretch and passed tired
ones. PAPAL LAW lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and was not a factor. VULCAN raced along the inner rail, chased the pace to mid
stretch and gave way. COOP TRIES HARDER raced in the two path between horses on the turn and weakened. VALUED NOTION , steadied in close
quarters along the rail mid way down the backstretch, steadied in traffic entering the turn. LIKE WHAT I SEE , a forward factor three deep around the turn,
weakened. CHARGE TO VICTORY trailed. An objection by the rider of W W SPRINGTIME against the winner for alleged interference in mid stretch was not

Footnotes
ANOTHER WOMAN , bumped at the break and off a step slow, recovered and advanced inside within herself heading to the half mile marker, eased out
and moved to take aim on the leader heading to the quarter pole, wrested command in upper stretch, opened up under a solid hand ride then was geared
down in the final yards. ESCAPE FUND saved ground pursuing, got through into the lane, edged up past mid stretch and kept on willingly to nab the place.
R B'S STAR , bumped at the break, straightened and sped up inside to dispute the pace with TWEET AWAY ROBIN, moved clear around the turn, failed to
contain the winner past the three sixteenths, stayed on willingly past mid stretch, wandered outward and faded. TWEET AWAY ROBIN vied outside R B'S
STAR early on, was attempting to get out leaving the far turn, corrected to chase three wide into the lane but came up empty. BEDTIMEBOURBON , off the
pace, saved ground leaving the far turn then lacked a rally. AWFULLY FOXY , off slowly, lagged well back, swung six wide for the drive then lacked a
serious response. SHINELIKEADIAMOND failed to menace. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE , four wide pursuing leaving the three eighths, faltered.

Footnotes
ENGLISH TAVERN , patiently rated inside horses down the backstretch, raced in the two path between foes on the far turn, was lightly steadied in traffic
leaving the far turn, found room along the inner rail in the stretch, led late and drove clear. KENTUCKY PHAROAH quickly made the early lead, moved over
to the inner rail entering the first turn, set the pace, was well off the rail in the stretch and just missed in a game effort. B DETERMINED lacked speed,
swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied nicely outside horses. U S CONSTITUTION chased the pace, raced in the two path around the far turn
and weakened in the stretch. HEALING , a forward factor three wide outside horses down the backstretch and around the far turn, failed to rally. JOHNG
lacked speed, raced inside horses for six furlongs, swung to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. BALLAGH ROCKS , four deep the far
turn, weakened. PRETTY GOOD YEAR , no factor, swung to the six path in upper stretch. BROKER'S REWARD , along the inner down the backstretch and
on the far turn, was checked lacking room approaching the stretch. AMERICAN D'ORO , eager to run early, hugged the inner rail on the far turn and was
checked in narrow quarters inside U S CONSTITUTION approaching the stretch. I AM THAT I AM , outrun, was five deep leaving the far turn. An objection
by the rider of AMERICAN D'ORO against U S CONSTITUION for alleged interference on the far turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
SUPER QUICK cleared soon after the break, traveled keenly three wide past the seven eighths, dropped in for the backstretch, moved away leaving the
three eighths, responded when put to a ride past the five sixteenths, powered away to a commanding lead in mid stretch then continued to widen while kept
to a strong drive. EXOTIC WEST angled out a bit then steadied lightly off heels soon after the break, angled out into the backstretch, circled three wide
making some progress past the five sixteenths, gave futile chase from there and saved the place. FROST POINT , four wide early, chased two wide down
the backstretch, shifted in and churned on. CLICK TO CONFIRM broke a step slow, moved up between foes to stalk the pace, dropped in to pursue through
the backstretch, failed to kick on nearing the lane and gave way. INTO VANISHING saved ground into the first turn, eased back nearing the seven eighths,
angled out, failed to make an impact into the far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
PIZZA BIANCA , a touch rank when taken under a snug rating hold leaving the starting gate, was confidently rated down the backstretch, raced two wide
into the far turn, eased out four deep entering the stretch, moved up outside horses in mid stretch, secured command near the sixteenth pole then drew
clear under urging. DIAMOND HANDS , in the two path chasing the pace down the backstretch and around the far turn, challenged for the lead between
horses in mid stretch and finished gamely. VERGARA , three wide the first turn, was up close three deep the far turn and finished willingly between foes.
LADY PUCHI lacked speed, was well back leaving the far turn, swung four wide in upper stretch and rallied. DETERMINED GOLD lacked speed along the
inner rail, eased off the rail turning for home, swung to the six path in upper stretch and passed faders. MURPH , eager to run early, sprinted clear on the
first turn, set the pace along the inner rail and tired the final furlong. HAIL TO , well off the pace down the backstretch, was not a factor. DETERMINED
STAR , forwardly placed along the inner rail, was done on the far turn.

Footnotes
LADY SCARLET , away in good order, tracked a contested pace while off the inside, shifted three wide mid turn, responded when roused soon into the lane,
rolled up outside the duelers then cleared with a furlong to go, widened under left handed asking and was taken in hand for the final strides. HAPPY SOUL
took over soon after the start and dropped in towards the rail, set a pressured pace while under some rating, dueled with GIMMICK into the lane, continued
the battle past the three sixteenths, kept on willingly though no match and earned the place. GIMMICK broke a bit awkwardly, forced the pace outside
HAPPY SOUL, drew on near even terms into the lane, fought on between runners nearing mid stretch then faded late. VERYLITTLECENTS lost her footing
at the break then stumbled badly soon after, regrouped and saved ground, steadied out of close quarters near the three eighths, angled five wide for the
drive and came on late. SAUCY LADY T , between foes early, shifted in around the turn and came up empty. LA CASA D'ORO dropped off the early pace,
circled three to four wide and failed to respond.

CAN THE QUEEN broke alertly and sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail around the turn, opened up in mid stretch and prevailed under
energetic urging. HONEY PANTS , along the inner rail down the backstretch, eased out on the turn, worked between horses through the stretch and closed
nicely. WHISPURRING KITTEN , two wide around the turn chasing the winner, finished evenly. ADELAIDE MISS lacked speed, raced along the inner rail
around the turn, moved to the two path in mid stretch and passed tired rivals. EPIC IDEA lacked speed, was inside horses entering the stretch, moved out to
race between rivals and passed tired ones. PHANTOM VISION raced along the inner rail throughout and weakened. SPUN GLASS , three wide on the turn,
lacked a rally. PAYNTDEMBLUESAWAY , three deep around the turn, chased the pace to mid stretch then gave way. PRINCESS KOKACHIN , done on the
turn, retreated through the stretch.

FIRST CAPTAIN rated off the pace three to four wide, came under a solid ride leaving the three eighths, swung six wide into the lane, closed determinedly
under stout left handed asking and forged to command in the final yards. VINDICTIVE stumbled at the break, regrouped and gained a tracking position
towards the rail, angled out and was put to pressure near the five sixteenths, moved up five wide to challenge in upper stretch, gained a slim advantage a
furlong out, dueled outside UNTREATED past the sixteenth pole, kept on valiantly but just failed to contain the winner's outside charge. UNTREATED took
over soon after the break, set a rated pace towards the inside, took pressure past the five sixteenths, was guided three wide battling inside WORKIN ON A
DREAM into the lane, dug in when threatened by VINDICTIVE soon after, fought on to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. WORKIN ON A DREAM
came out at the break and bumped with a rival, prompted the pace outside the leader, bid to apply more pressure while under a ride past the five sixteenths,
disputed the issue four wide between runners into the stretch then faded. MOHAAFETH steadied when forced out by CAPOCOSTELLO entering the first
turn, lost ground four wide leaving the far turn then churned on through the drive. TREASURE TROVE broke a step slow and outward, lost ground four to
five wide, made a mild run under a drive near the five sixteenths then came up empty. MISCHIEF AFOOT settled well back, circled six wide into the stretch
but lacked a rally. EXCELLORATOR , brushed at the break, stalked three wide, failed to kick on into the far turn and faded. CAPOCOSTELLO , brushed at
the start, drifted out nearing the first turn, corrected and saved some ground while in range, lacked a kick nearing the quarter pole and gave way.
FOREWARNED , jostled at the break, saved ground, was under a ride into the far turn but failed to kick on.

Footnotes
INTERSTATEDAYDREAM stalked the pace outside BEGUINE, gained command in upper stretch, opened a clear lead in mid stretch and was kept to her
business in the drive. ADARE MANOR , kept outside horses in a striking position down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, floated to the four
path in upper stretch and rallied nicely. RADIO DAYS , alertly taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail thereafter and rallied.
DIVINE HUNTRESS , along the inner rail staking the pace, swung out in upper upper stretch and failed to rally. FAVOR , four wide the first turn, was never
far back while off the rail, swung outside mid stretch and failed to rally in an even effort. MORNING MATCHA lacked speed, raced off the rail on the far turn,
swung to the seven path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. MISS YEARWOOD , bumped and in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced along
the inner rail down the backstretch, swung to the seven path in upper stretch and was no threat. DISTINCTLYPOSSIBLE lightly bumped with CANDY
LIGHT at the start, raced between horses the far turn and lacked a rally. MIDNIGHT STROLL , checked in tight quarters entering the first turn, raced wide
around the far turn and was never a factor. CANDY LIGHT lightly bumped with DISTAINCTLYPOSSIBLE at the start, was no factor and altered course
around BEGUINE in deep stretch. LUNA BELLE broke slowly, was outrun and swung to the eight path in upper stretch. BEGUINE sped to the early lead, set
the pace near the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, weakened and was eased late. MISSY GREER bumped with MISS YEARWOOD at the break and
faltered on the far turn.

THAT'S RIGHT accelerated clear from the inside, dictated the pace under some rating, kicked away in mid stretch and proved clearly best under a steady
drive. PELIGROSO chased off the inside, gave way grudgingly and saved the place. HEAVEN'S GOT FIRE saved ground mid turn, eased out in the the
drive and rallied between foes. CLAUDEE BOY , three wide, moved up some into the lane and continued with effort. BLAME B B saved ground and lacked a
bid. VOTETHEMALLOUT rated off the pace while saving ground, swung out and finished well. VICTORY ANTHEM failed to keep pace.
