Footnotes
RIGHT TRAPPE with the second flight, rallied three wide splitting horses into the far turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and drew off under left
handed urging. CATABOUT away alertly, the pace pace along the rail into the far turn then was no match for the winner but held on for second. SHE'S
CRAFTY trailed into the stretch, swung outside and closed a gap late. QUEEN HIGH failed to menace. SHANNON'S GIRL pressed the pace two wide
through the second turn and weakened in the stretch. SWEET EVY GRACE bumped at the start, loomed boldly four wide on the far turn then came up
empty. JETTIN PEGASUS was bumped then steadied at the start and was no factor.

Footnotes

BIRDIE'S CHANTZ allowed to settle, rallied determinedly three wide through the stretch and got up for second. SAYHELLOTHENGOODBY allowed to
settle, had a mild late rally in the middle of the racetrack. MISS ELLIE chased the early pace, loomed boldly two wide before the quarter pole, matched
strides until mid stretch then came up empty. TALE OF THE LYON broke in front, set the pace along the rail to the top of the stretch then weakened.
LAYITONTHICK stalked the early pace along the inside and was through after a half. ANIMO STAR was no factor. MARGARITA CINCO was outrun.

Footnotes
CATMAN JACK allowed to settle, swung wide, closed with a burst of speed in the eighth path through the stretch and was along in time. LONE BOY
pressed the pace three then two wide, made the lead in upper stretch then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner. HAPPY TAKEOVER never far
back, surged six wide into the stretch then was outfinished. TIDE RISING vied for the lead four wide and went evenly. HITE was antsy in the gate, bumped
at the start and found his best stride late. THE GOSPEL OF MARK trailed into the stretch, swung wide and closed ground late in the middle of the racetrack.
COWTOWN BOSS was fractious in the gate and no threat. VOLUME OF TRUST was no factor. VOLUME LEADER close up two wide, faded in the stretch.
CHOCOLATE RABBIT raced five wide with speed into the turn then gave way. POWERFUL PHIL saved ground and was through early. RED HOT POWER
broke outward bumping a rival, pressed the pace into the turn then was used up. ZAKARIA made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the stretch
then stopped.

Footnotes
ALGORIX away alertly, set all the pace and maintained his advantage under brisk handling. PALTARREVENGE never far back, had a mild late rally in the
five path and was steadily cutting into the winners advantage late. OPEN OUT with the second flight three wide, improved position into the stretch then was
outfinished. TENTWELVEFOURTEEN chased the winner two wide into the stretch then faded. CAT'S CURIOSITY close up along the inside, lacked the
needed response. GUCCISSIMO trailed well back, passed a tiring rival, pulled up injured past the wire and was vanned off. SUPER VISION chased, the
winner four wide for a half then stopped.

Footnotes
SMOKIN HOT ENERGY had speed from the start two wide, dropped back a bit and inside on the turn, got through along the rail to make the lead at the top
of the stretch and edged clear under brisk handling. YO BERBS never far back, loomed boldly four wide nearing the top of the stretch and finished second
best. OHIO PLAYER had good early speed along the inside, checked past the half mile pole, dropped back to trail through the turn, swung wide then came
on again late. JOHNNY U away alertly, set a pressured pace in the two path to the top of the stretch then was outfinished. WIZARD WILLIE settled just off
the leaders three wide, drew closer on the turn then failed to sustain that bid. RED BLUE AND TRUE failed to menace. CAJUN CHAOS battled for the lead
three then two wide and gave way in the stretch.
