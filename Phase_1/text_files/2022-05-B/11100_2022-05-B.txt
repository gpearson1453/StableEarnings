JUMEIRAH COAST stalked the pacesetter, swept the lead nearing the quarter pole, drew clear and held safely. ETU BABOU settled outside early, rallied
four wide approaching the stretch and closed gap on the leader late. HE'S CRIMSON CODE trailed the field early, lodged a rail bid after the quarter pole
and improved position. EXHI KID set the early pace, was overtaken quickly at the quarter pole and weakened through the stretch. PAULIE WALNUTS
chased inside and lacked a closing response. PULL THE PIN reserved off the pacesetters and failed to threaten when called upon.

Footnotes
ABOVE AND BEYOND broke sharply, contended the early pace while three wide, drew clear into the stretch then won going away. VIRTUAL SILVER sat in
striking distance of the pacesetters, drove four wide leaving the final turn, rallied determinedly outside of SILVERFOOT and won the bob for second honors.
SILVERFOOT lacked a clear path leaving, chased from the second flight, drifted in at the head of the stretch, dueled through the stretch and was bested for
place. DARK STORM COMING contested the early pace, was unable to move with the eventual winner, and faded in the final furlong. OUTLAWED IN
TEXAS lacked a clear path leaving, trailed and lacked a bid. YNOTGIVEITAGO chased four wide through the backstretch and was done early. *JOCKEY
OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of OUTLAWED IN TEXAS against the rider of DARK STORM COMING and ABOVE AND BEYOND alleging
interference at the start. The Board of Stewards deemed to have insufficient film evidence to warrant any change. *JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection

Footnotes
YORKTOWN vied outside of EVER TRUE, dueled outside CHASKA through the final turn, and edged away in the final sixteenth. CHASKA hustled early,
moved up alongside of YORKTOWN to challenge the lead and weakened late stretch. EVER TRUE vied between foes for the lead, dropped back leaving
the backstretch, chased through the stretch and held for show. WEEKEND WIZARD rated off the early pacesetters, launched an all out bid through the
stretch and was unable to get by for third. SMOKIN ENCOUNTER trailed early and showed a mild interest late. ITS ALL ON SLEW allowed to settle early,
raced five wide into the lane and failed to threaten. VISIONS OF JOY offered little.

outside if AMBER RIDGE, gained the lead at the three eighths pole, was under attack at the head of the stretch then was run down and finished second
best. BEAUTIFUL BABE stalked wide through the backstretch, asked to quicken in the final turn, closed gradually and was along in time for show. DAME
DEVIL chased throughout and was edged out for third. BELLS AND WHISTLES stalked the pace four to five wide, rallied mildly and flattened out late. LIL
OL FLATTER reared at the start then was gapped and closed the gap late. AMBER RIDGE vied hard inside, was overtaken then was eased.

Footnotes
SOARIN DIVA vied for the early lead, lead the field through the backstretch, responded to looming threat from GOTCHA JENNY and held under a late drive.
LASKA saved ground early, took closer order in the final turn, closed steadily and just missed after a determined try. GOTCHA JENNY sat in striking
position, moved up menacingly at the quarter pole then drifted in under right handed encouragement, then steadied and was bested for place. LANA'S
PRETTY GIRL raced four to five wide through the backstretch, drifted in under right handed urging, and flattened late stretch. LIL MISS MUD stalked the
pace from the rail and lacked a rally. STORM CANYON failed to threaten. THIS TIME SWEETIE sat mid pack and faded.

Footnotes
SIR BRONX sat just off the pace under a snug hold while four wide, advanced outside in the final turn, rallied determinedly outside through the stretch and
got by just in time in a multi-horse scramble to the finish. PADDYSDAYCHARM showed the way into the backstretch, was under attack at the head of the
lane, battled between foes and lost the bob. CONCUR was under a strong hold from the rail, rallied inside of rivals through the stretch drive under urging
and just missed. INTENT TO STRIKE sat in range while three wide and was unable to improve position through the drive. BOOKIE saved ground from rail
and raced evenly. ADRIEN'S AURORA raced wide through the backstretch and faded. ANELLO chased outside and failed to threaten.
