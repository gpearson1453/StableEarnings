PRESKITT vied for the early lead and held well in the drive to be clear under strong encouragement. CIELO DIAMANTE was forced to check sharply in the
early stages, raced two to three wide through the far turn, angled in to make a good rail bid and got up for the place position late. GOLD N GLITTER vied for
the early lead along the inside and weakened a bit in the final stages. WEGOTTODRINKING stalked the pace, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole
and had not in the drive. AKASI was hustled early, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out in the drive and never threatened. SMILING SALSA
raced five wide through the far turn and never was a factor. The five eighths fractional time was unavailable.

Footnotes
ZAZEN showed good early speed to set the pace and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. LET IT REIGN stalked the pace, raced three to
four wide and was no match for the winner in the drive. RODEO ROSE stalked the pace, raced three wide at the quarter pole and had no final winning bid.
SHIRL'S HOUSE was forwardly placed to lay up close early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and had no late run.
NITEUSTOLEMYHEART was hustled along early, raced five wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. BARSINTHECAR raced four wide
through the far turn and never threatened. HELLS CROSSING dropped back early and failed to respond. AMERICAN RIDGE drifted out down the
backstretch and was eased up on.
