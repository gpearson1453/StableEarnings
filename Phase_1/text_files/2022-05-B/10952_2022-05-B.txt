Footnotes
MINNESOTA READY tracked the leaders from the three path around the turn, shifted to the six path to take aim outside of them entering the lane, rallied to
bid in upper stretch, drove past at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. ENGRAVE raced forwardly placed two wide and between horses in pursuit of the
leader early on, stalked three wide while in the four path around the turn, ranged up in the five path entering the lane, vied in upper stretch as an outer rival
rallied alongside, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong grounds, and kept on to hold place. MUSTAZEED tracked three wide and between horses
early on, chased from midpack and in the five path around the turn while under strong encouragement, yet stayed on in the final furlong to bid for minor
placings late, and reached show. SEA FORCE pressed four wide early on, sustained pressure outside of the leader while in the three path around the turn,
vied in the four path entering the lane as outer foes ranged up, but hung on his left lead, got outkicked by outer foes in upper stretch, and yielded through
the final furlong. HILL OF GOLD came under a drive off of the pace to gain position after a furlong, chased while off of the pace in the three path around the
turn, and failed to factor. BEST BET set the pace in the two path while inside of a rival around the turn, met a pair of other bids entering the lane and in
upper stretch, but readily weakened approaching the final furlong. ACTIVE DUTY broke a step slowly at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, but made
little impact. CAN'T HUSH THIS rushed inside of rivals after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, stalked in the two path behind the top pair around the turn, but
weakened through the lane. OVERSLEPT raced far back two wide, and never got involved. BLUEGRASS ROYALE broke slowly, and got outrun.

Footnotes
VERB set the pace early on, felt stern and increasing pressure from a pair of outer rivals around the turn, shook free of them in upper stretch, drew clear
strongly, then tired in the final furlong as EMERALD EXPRESS closed in, but lasted to the wire. EMERALD EXPRESS laid off of the pace along the inside,
lost momentum when forced to alter course outside of HOPE AND DIGNITY approaching the turn, chased the leader trio from midpack and in the three path
around the turn, tipped outside of them entering the lane, rallied while narrowing the clear leader's margin through the final sixteenth, but ran out of ground.
PICASSO bumped with an inner MAJESTIC WEST multiple times through the opening furlong, settled far back, gained in the four path around the turn, but
got floated out a path in upper stretch while failing to match rallying strides with an inner rival, and leveled off outside of foes. RODERICK stalked three
wide, engaged the top pair into the turn, gained to bid for the lead approaching the five sixteenths pole, vied while drifting to the four path entering the lane,
but failed to keep pace with an inner counterpart in upper stretch before the rider lost a yellow rag-like piece of equipment at the three sixteenths pole, and
tired between horses. FULL IMPACT pressed two wide, then from between horses into the turn, vied turning for home, but faded in upper stretch.
MAJESTIC WEST got warm and was sweating profusely in the post parade, exchanged bumps with an outer foe in the opening furlong, and never got
involved. HOPE AND DIGNITY chased along the inside early on, but folded into the turn.

Footnotes
EL KABONG raced in midpack two wide and between horses, tracked among foes into the far turn, cut the corner turning for home after an inner rival
faltered, grinded away along the inside in pursuit of the leading pair in upper stretch, ranged up to them passing the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left
lead momentarily while vying entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage in the late stages. SKYRO vied for the lead two wide and between foes
into the first turn, cleared an inner rival entering the backstretch, clung to an advantage from an outer vying MONITION into the far turn, shifted to the four
path entering the lane to float that foe wider, battled tenaciously through midstretch, repulsed his outer counterpart in the final furlong as EL KABONG
menaced to his inside, but was bested by that foe in the final sixteenth. POINT ME BY settled far back in the three path, then four to five wide around the far
turn, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and stayed on willingly. MONITION vied for the lead three wide, then two wide entering the backstretch, got
floated to the five path entering the lane by his inner counterpart, sustained the conflict through upper stretch, but failed to keep pace in the final furlong, and
yielded a sixteenth from home. OCEAN ATLANTIQUE got caught in the five to four path whilst midpack around the first turn, tracked intently while inching
closer four wide around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane, but only managed to chase through midstretch before flattening out. SPLIT
THE WICKETS broke very rankly before being allowed to settle far off of the pace, took the turns in the four to three paths before swinging to the eight path
entering the lane, and improved position. JIMMY DAN trailed along the inside, then moved up between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on.
CONTINENTAL COINS rushed to vie for the lead inside of a pair of foes into the first turn, was restrained back to stalk approaching the backstretch, chased
from the two path around the far turn, but faded approaching midstretch. SHACKLEFORD'S JOY tracked from midpack along the inside, but faded around
the far turn. ERON DO JAGUARETE (BRZ) took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, raced off of the pace three wide, then from between horses
around the far turn, but made little impact. HAIG POINT bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked in the three path around the first turn, chased from
among foes around the far turn, but faded turning for home. SPEITFUL SAM stalked four to three wide, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
OPEN ROAD tracked three wide, bid in the five path entering the lane, drew clear approaching midstretch, and held sway from an outer rival. PLAUSIBLE
DENILE stalked along the inside, got outmoved by the eventual winner turning for home while awaiting racing room behind the leader, shifted out in upper
stretch after that foe got a jump, took aim outside of the leader in midstretch, but was only 2nd best. PREDOMINATE trailed around the turn, then stayed on
through the lane. KIAWAH BREEZE moved forward to stalk the pace setter from the outside, bid for the lead entering the lane as an outer foe rallied
alongside, but was outkicked in upper stretch, and weakened approaching the furlong grounds. PRIZE FIGHTER rushed between horses to set the pace in
the two path, met a pair of bids entering the lane, and weakened. PAID TWICE was slow into stride, took the turn in the four to five path while off of the
pace, and never got involved. ROARING GAP chased from midpack in the three path, but tired turning for home.
