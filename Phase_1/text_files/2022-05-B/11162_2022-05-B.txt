HAY BUCK vied outside, took over after half a mile, vied inside on the final turn then gamely repelled another challenge. CREEDIBILITY settled off the
leaders, bid wide into the stretch and closed well. TAYLOR'S BELLE dropped far behind, advanced very wide and finished strongly but too late. ANGEL
RAPHAEL well placed behind the dueling leaders, vied through the final turn and continued willingly. PARTY IN THE SAND lagged far behind then caught a
stopping opponent. MY MASTERPIECE dueled along the inside to the far turn and gave way readily.

the turn, loomed a threat into the stretch but flattened out. COUSIN MARIE hesitated at the start breaking well behind her field, rushed to contention and

MARIANNA QUEEN controlled the pace inside, widened into the stretch then pulled away quickly increasing her advantage. SQUAN'S KINGDOM settled
close up, went after the winner on the final turn then came up empty holding the place. CARMELTINI dropped back outside then rallied mildly for the show
award. GINGERS WISH chased wide throughout and lacked a solid rally. GLOWING STAR moved just off the leader in the two path, inside on the final turn
and faded. MALIBU ANTHEM prompted the winner for half a mile and stopped. MINESHAFT MAGIC saved ground off the leaders and weakened steadily.

PRIVATE NETWORK set a measured pace inside then held off constant challenger through the lane while kept to a drive. WILD UNION broke alertly,
pressed the winner throughout and yielded late. SAMARONTI lacked speed, awaited room on the final turn, split foes in midstretch and finished with a mild
bid. POLITICAL was urged close up three wide then weakened in the stretch. WEEKEND IN COURT settled off the pace outside, moved briefly closer at the
quarter pole and faded. WE BE THERE saved ground close up for five furlongs and faltered. PIGGYBANK dropped back after the start and trailed
throughout.

TRIBORD earned a narrow lead outside, edged clear into the stretch then held off outside challenge while kept to a drive. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE settled
outside the dueling leaders, loomed a wide threat into the stretch but could not get by the winner. GOING GOING GONE vied along the rail to the stretch
then came up empty. JUMPINTOACTION trailed far behind then offered some late energy while no threat. SHARON'S LAW prompted the pace outside for
half a mile and gave way. YOURINDENIAL chased inside and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
SHOFAR settled outside, bid into the stretch then wore down the pacesetter and edged clear through the final sixteenth. SOVEREIGN WARRIOR rated just
off the pace, slipped through inside to the front, bid clear but was caught late. MR. EINSTEIN dropped back outside, angled inside in the stretch and rallied.
KITTEN STREET alternated for the lead outside for three quarters and tired. EXPENSIVE CUT dueled along the inside then proved empty in the stretch.
STONEGATE dropped back inside and was never in contention. S MAN chased far behind throughout. PIER FORTY dropped back after the start and was
never a factor. EYE OF GUNFIGHTER prompted the pace along the inside for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
GRIT'N'GRIND dropped far behind, advanced wide on the final turn then surged past pair of opponents and bid clear late. BORSA VENTO pursued the
loose pacesetter, collared the leader midway on the final turn, led in midstretch but could not hold off the winner. GENGHIS quickly sped to the front,
remained clear to the final turn, dueled then proved empty. LOAD UP MOE trailed far behind then passed fading rivals. SOPHOS lacked speed along the
inside and was never a factor. WAGON BOSS bobbled at the break, displayed poor action before half a mile, continued to drop back losing contact with his
field.

Footnotes
DRILLOMATIC settled well behind, moved extremely wide advancing into the stretch and was up late. SHARP RED EAGLE rated inside, bid into the
stretch, loomed boldly but was outfinished in the final yards. VICTOR'S DYNASTY saved ground behind the leaders, led in midstretch then weakened.
BLACK LIGHT prompted the pace outside, led into the stretch then came up empty. BOB IN OUR MIDST moved closer three wide before the half, moved
very wide into the stretch and flattened out. ABDAA lacked speed then offered some late energy. DRAMATIZED set clear pace to the final turn and
weakened through the final furlong. KID MAC COOL crowded rival into the first turn then gave way readily. SOUTHERN RUNNER was taken up sharply and
bobbled badly into the first turn. The stewards conducted an inquiry into the incident on the first turn with no action. An objection by the third finisher against
the second finisher for interference was dismissed.

Footnotes
FRAN'S WORRIER eased back off the pacesetter, took over near the quarter pole then drew away through the stretch. PUTTHEGLASSDOWN chased
three wide, rallied into the stretch and lasted for the place. THEY SHOT SONNY chased in the two path then closed well outside late. SILVER FURY far
behind early, angled near the inside on the turn then split foes late. CLASSIFIED INFO dropped back early then continued nicely while no threat. LAWN
BOY (GB) lacked speed, moved very wide on the turn and was no factor. HOORAY FOR HARVEY chased in midpack, faded on the turn and was outrun.
TOMATER GATOR saved ground close up then gave way. EXTREME FORCE broke slowest and never in contention. LAZARETTO rushed to the front
inside then stopped through the stretch.
