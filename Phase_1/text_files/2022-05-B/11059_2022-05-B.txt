Footnotes
LADY UNBRIDLED chased tp pair to the stretch inside, in tight angled out inside final furlong to be up in time as much the best. ROSES FOR ASHLEY
speed to the front dueled to turn, shook free, could not last. PRIZED CUPCAKE slow into stride to the turn, rallied past quarter pole up for third. LA
TAPATIA inside trip, shuffled back into turn, bid mid stretch, lost show late. THREE POINT KUZ off slow, no speed to turn, angled out while no real threat.
SCOOCH stayed with leader to the quarter pole, came up empty stretch. AMORADA broke slowly, rushed outside to the turn, never a menace.
