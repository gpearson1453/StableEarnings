DATA STORM tracked the top two leaders three to four wide around the turn, launched a four wide bid into the upper stretch, took over the leaf at the
furlong marker and finished going away. RIDE RICHIE RIDE quickly cleared soon after the start and held firm around the turn, showed the way into the
upper stretch then got collared by the winner near the furlong marker and finished second best. ROCK CITY ROCKET raced near midpack leaving the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and churned on for a share. KEESAWAH raced off the early pace, was ridden
along three wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. CHISMOSO lacked speed and raced in the back, saved ground around the turn and never
threatened. ITS A DEAL was forwardly placed soon after the start, chased the leader around the turn then came up empty in the upper stretch.

DIVA TREVA bumped with rival at the start then set a pressured pace up the backstretch, continued to dictate terms by a slim margin around the turn,
responded when called upon, turning for home, widened to a clear advantage in the upper stretch and kept to task under steady urging. ANIME DAY raced
off the top trio entering the turn, launched a four wide heading into the lane, sustained steady response through the stretch run and gained second best.
BOOTLEGGING GIRL tracked the top two leaders into the turn, given cue three wide at the top of the lane and ran on evenly in late stages. FELONY
applied pace pressure to the winner in opening stages, continued to force the issue around the turn then failed to keep pace in the upper stretch and
retreated. THE REESE BEAST hit the gate then got bumped at the start, raced in the back, came five wide into the upper stretch and failed to move into
contention.

JUSTICE ONCE tucked inside heading into the first turn and settled nicely while rated off the early pace, began to pick up the tempo along the rail midway
around the far turn, angled out and given cue four wide heading into the upper stretch, took command from ROCKYMOUNTAINBREW past the furlong
marker and pulled away. ROCKYMOUNTAIN BREW got bumped by the winner at the start, stalked the pace up the backstretch, vied three deep for the
lead around the far turn, held command a furlong out then lost control to the winner and had to settle for second best. WELLER ROGUE vied for the lead
with LURCH around the first turn, continued to battle back between foes around the far turn, failed to move on with the top pair in the upper stretch and
weakened to show. PISTOL PACKIN MAN was off slow at the start and trailed the field up the backstretch, was ridden along three wide in the upper stretch
and passed tiring foes. LURCH dueled inside of WELLER ROGUE for the lead up the backstretch, fought back along the rail around the far turn then came
up empty in the upper stretch. FLASH IN THE PAN tracked in contention through early stages and came up empty after the half mile marker.

END ALL GET ALL was well rated racing between foes off the clear top pair up the backstretch, made a three wide move entering the far turn, took over the
lead from RED HURRICANE in the upper stretch, angled in and held clear under a driving finish. SACRED OATH was unhurried and settled in the back,
picked up the tempo late on the far turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch and produced a solid finish. RED HURRICANE dueled for the early lead
racing inside of GRAND DESIGN, continued to battle for the lead while racing well clear over the second flight, shook free near the quarter pole, led the way
in to the upper stretch then got collared by the winner and weakened to show. NEEDABETTERJOCK rated off the embattled duo up the backstretch,
hustled up three wide around the far turn, came four wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. BROADWAY tucked inside and settled through early
stages, launched an inside bid into the upper stretch, showed brief response then gave way. GRAND DESIGN dueled outside of RED HURRICANE for the
early lead while well clear over the rest, could not match strides near the quarter pole and retreated late on the far turn.

Footnotes
PRIVATE LAKE set a pressured pace up the backstretch, held a slim lead around the far turn, took command two wide in the upper stretch and kept clear
under steady urging. BIG HEARTED FACTOR stalked the pace through early stages, launched a three wide bid near the quarter pole, sustained steady
response through the stretch run and finished second best. ALWAYS A CATCH rated two wide just off the early pace, came under a ride late on the far turn,
sustained a four wide at the furlong marker and gained show. ASTUTE WARRIOR was allowed to settle through early stages, picked up the pace four wide
late on the turn, raced in range in the upper stretch then ran on evenly. HOLIDAY MAN applied pace pressure to the winner up the backstretch, continued to
force the issue around the far turn then weakened in the lane. ROCK CITY ROADHOG tracked the pace through early stages, launched a bid along the rail
late on the far turn, cut the corner and continued in contention in the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. HUNK OF A HIT tossed head up
repeatedly at the start and lost ground then raced in the back throughout.

Footnotes
DEANOS CAPE stalked the pace up the backstretch, advanced into close contention entering the far turn, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch,
took command and kept clear. MAKABIM tracked the pace through early stages, launched a three wide bid midway around the far turn, could not kick on
with the winner in the upper stretch but sustained steady response for second best. WHISKEY WEDNESDAY was rated up the backstretch, hustled up
along the rail around the far turn, shifted out in the upper stretch, stayed on with response and cleared the rest. RECORDER raced off the early pace,
hustled up two wide in the upper stretch and lacked a needed rally. EDITOR IN CHIEF was forwardly placed up the backstretch and into the far turn then
weakened in the lane. SWAGGY GEORGE was away awkwardly at the start then quickly advanced to take over the early lead, set the pace up the
backstretch, held onto a diminishing lead around the far turn then got collared in the upper stretch and weakened. J'S LITTLE MAN failed to move into
contention.
