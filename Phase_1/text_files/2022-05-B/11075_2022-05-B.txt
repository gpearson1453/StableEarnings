Footnotes
FORTE chased the pace from third, raced inside to the two path early on the turn, angled four wide at the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead into upper
stretch then moved in some while disposing of the runner-up, powered away under strong urging to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the
best. WASABI BOY was fractious in the gate and tossed the rider out the back of the stall, came away in good order after getting good help from the
assistant starter to straighten his head, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path while still inside that opponent around the turn, lost
the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, moved out behind that foe inside the furlong marker and proved no match while well clear for the place.
VAMONOS dropped back under urging, dropped from the four path to the two path early on the turn, moved out some in upper stretch and lacked the
needed response while best of the rest. PLEASE BABY was slowest into stride, raced at the rear under urging, moved in late on the backstretch, went two
to three wide around the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor. GOTTA LIKE HIM showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside
then in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
LAFITTE'S FLEET chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through the
final furlong overhauling the leg weary leader in the last jumps to the finish and just got the bob on the line. GLORY ROAD six paths off the inside down the
backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, rallied kicking on in the late stages and
just missed at the end. STRIKING SPEED hustled from the gate, showed the way from the two path before being engaged by ITS ALL RELEVANT to the
outside, dueled with that foe from the five furlong marker through the turn shaking off that danger nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing late threat leg weary and was caught by a pair in the final strides to the finish.
FULL COURT PRESS chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. MOUNT
TRAVERS chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MAGNIFICENT
CHROME chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the stretch. ITS ALL RELEVANT
stumbled at the start getting away last, advanced four paths off the inside down the backstretch to duel with STRIKING SPEED to his inside with five
furlongs to go, tucked to the two path through the turn continuing to knock heads until shaken off at the five-sixteenths, cornered three wide at the head of
the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
OSIRIA displayed good speed, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then
came under a drive while off the rail in upper stretch, fought inside of the runner-up into the final sixteenth and proved best under strong urging. FROSTED
OATS moved up then stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the two path around the turn, came out a bit some under pressure into upper stretch, battled
outside of the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while able to hold the place. DEVILLY was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved
ground in dead-aim of the leader around the turn, was roused while swinging four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two while outside in the drive and
finished with good courage but missed the place while able to get the show. MRS. GREEN broke a bit slow then was taken up some, spotted the front a few
lengths, settled towards the rear, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths and improved position. BALI BELLE settled nicely just off
the pace on the outside, went two to three wide around the turn, was given her cue inside the five-sixteenths, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked
the needed response. MOSTLY HARMLESS dropped back quickly on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, was urged along in the two path around
the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. DREAM FLY settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn, came four wide into
the stretch then moved further out and was no factor.

stretch in the two path, was asked at the three-sixteenths, tipped out around the furlong marker then accelerated, rallied to the lead at the sixteenth-pole and
proved best under strong handling. SASSY MELISSA bumped with foes on both sides at the start then dropped back while in tight, angled in at the rear of
the field, was taken up while rank off heels outside the half-mile pole, went two then three wide while still in reserve around the turn, shifted six wide over
heels into upper stretch, was roused around the three-sixteenths, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed fast to get the place in a troubled journey.
GUARDIAN MOON pressed the pace on the outside while in hand, vied in the three path around the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then took the
lead in upper stretch, shook clear outside the furlong marker, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken and just missed the place but was clear for
the show. SOCIAL WHIRL lunged at the start then bobbled and spotted the front a few lengths, settled near the back, went three then four wide on the turn,
was roused five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ITSAKEYPER broke in at the start, settled off the pace, moved in while getting closer
late on the backstretch, drafted inside around the turn, shifted three wide whiled asked into upper stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and
weakened. VIOLENT POINT was rated just off the pace, dropped from the four path to the three path early on the turn, raced in hand past the quarter-pole,

around the turn, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. JILL'S A HOT MESS bumped lightly with a foe

when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, drifted out when switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker,

good energy to just get the show. BLAME THE BOOZE brushed with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, traveled around the turn in the two
path, was asked near the five-sixteenths, came three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong then was carried out and was out-kicked
then just missed the show. JUULSTONE moved in while reserved off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was asked at the quarter-pole then moved
out while put to a drive in upper stretch, jostled with a foe while in tight quarters around the sixteenth-pole and lost his best chance at the minor awards.

in near the furlong marker and gained ground but failed to impact. GIRAMONTE pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under strong urging, had his path taken while dropping back some into the final furlong and tired. STORM SHOOTER brushed with a foe

Footnotes
TEMPERMENTAL settled towards the rear of the field, went two then three wide around the turn, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied on the far outside,
closed fast to get the lead near the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. COOLCATSNKITTENS settled on the outside, went four wide around
the turn, rallied into upper stretch, closed well to get the lead outside the sixteenth-pole but was quickly overtaken by the winner while clear for the place.
MO DAMORNINGGROUCH angled in while settling well off the pace, went three then four wide around the turn, moved out while asked for her best in
upper stretch and improved to get the show. ROAD TO REMEMBER settled on the outside, was roused five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and also improved position while up for the last spot in the superfecta. BUNTY WINDERMERE settled off the pace, went three then four wide around the
turn, chased into upper stretch, took the advantage outside the furlong marker, lost the lead to the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened.
WHITE HOT tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back four then three wide around the turn, had the rider lose his crop into upper stretch, chased
under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong and tired. WAR IN PARADISE settled near the middle of the field, rounded the turn in the two path, came
three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. RENT CONTROL went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, drew off in the two path
around the turn, bobbled while shortening stride around the three-sixteenths, was collared outside the furlong marker and gave way. BERTINGA settled off
the pace, dropped back while saving ground on the turn, was crowded a bit nearing the quarter-pole and failed to respond. SWEET LIES acted-up badly at
the start and nearly unseated the rider, came out extremely slow, saved ground around the turn and was no factor. JET SET JULIET was well placed just off
the pace, went three then two wide on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated.
