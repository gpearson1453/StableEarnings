Footnotes
REEL EM IN dueled inside a rival but off the fence, took the lead at the top of the stretch, held. MAJORWAYHOME tracked the early leaders mid-pack,
saved ground, closed the gap late inside. BRIGHT WAY dueled outside three wide, weakened. ZAMBEZI FEVER stalked the leading pair, was getting out
near the quarter pole, came back in four wide later on the turn, kept on in the lane and just missed show honors. RED RASCAL saved ground inside and ran
evenly. ZENFULLY ZESTY chased from outside three then five wide on the turn, was not near enough to threaten running on evenly. SEVEN ROONEY
went four wide on the turn and failed to menace. CLOSING TIME CUTIE chased the leaders mid-pack three wide through the turn then weakened. MR.
MERCEDES was between runners early, went two wide on the turn, was not a factor. FLIGHT SPEED broke a bit awkwardly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AUTOPILOT eased back off the leaders to track inside on or just off the rail, was reserved in behind runners into the far turn awaiting room, tipped out past
the quarter pole to commence a four wide bid, edged past late. MT. TAYLOR was caught outside rivals four wide on the first turn, shifted in a bit up the
backstretch then back out on the far turn going three wide on that bend, made a mild bid at the top of the stretch but settled for the place. VODKA TWIST
set the pace in the clear inside, moved off the rail up the backstretch, challenged turning for home and yielded grudgingly. CAUSE AND EFFECT went four
to five wide and offered no late kick. KICK IT was bumped lightly after the break, settled inside mid-pack heading into the first turn, moved out from two to
four wide on the far turn and improved position. JEN'S BIG O switched out heading into the first turn going three wide on that bend racing last but one,
continued off the fence still far back to the far turn and passed tired rivals. STARSHIP CHEWY bumped a rival after the break, saved ground and passed
tired rivals. ROUSING RUBBLE was forwardly-placed early three wide and between runners, shifted in heading up the backstretch, drifted out three deep
leaving the far turn and came up empty. JEDI WARRIOR settled three wide early, swung six wide turning for home and failed to menace. HOOK EM chased
briefly two wide, dropped back three to five wide on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
OAKES CROSSING set the tempo into the first turn three wide, moved in a path and was engaged by an outside foe, dueled, edged clear turning for home
and held under steady handling. SHORT POCKETS pressed outside three to four wide, lost place late. BESITOS CRIMINALES was carried four wide into
the first turn, moved in while advancing two deep on the far turn, tipped out four wide near the three-sixteenths, gained late to get up for second. TRACK
BOUND tracked two to three wide, lacked the needed late kick. LOPIN JOE exchanged a hard bump at the break, went two to three wide and failed to
menace. LINCOLN COUNTY KID pressed inside, steadily retreated. TOX exchanged a solid bump at the break, trailed while racing off the inside and was
never a threat. ATTILA'S FLAG raced four to five wide and failed to rally. DEL ARGENT angled out entering the first turn, pursued mid-pack three to four
deep, was eased through the stretch and walked off.

wide, took command before the top of the stretch and drew clear. HEREDITARY settled two to three wide off the leaders early, moved out from three to five
wide on the far turn, gained the place. GORDY'S RULES set the pace on or just off the rail with pressure, weakened. SCOTTY WHO stalked three to four
wide and within range, failed to rally. IMA SAINT TOO shifted in heading to the first turn, moved up inside to press early up the backstretch, steadily
weakened. CHARLIE COMANCH was mid-pack four to five wide, took closer order later up the backstretch, had no rally for the drive. D K'S CROWN settled
inside, failed to threaten. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE went three to four wide and failed to rally. BRAZILIAN SUMMER pressed two to three wide and came
up empty.

Footnotes
MAMACITA CARTIER moved forward to dictate terms inside on or just off the rail, edged clear turning for home, held sway under steady handling. MY
INSTIGATOR stalked the winner two to three wide, proved no match. MR. MCFEELY advanced inside on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. SEA OF
INDY was ridden along early to chase, raced near the inside on the turn, passed tired rivals. MAD MICK swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
JACKSONS GIRL was off slowly then moved forward rapidly outside rivals to attend the early pace, dropped back three to four wide on the turn and came
up empty. CRAIGS VICTORY went three to four wide on the turn and was not a factor. STITCHED PASSION was off slowly and distanced.
