Footnotes
LAWN DART stalked the pace on the outside, held position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, made a steady gain and
drove clear late. RIVETRIX set the pace on the inside, held sway to the final yards, then was no match for the winner and held the place safe. ODD GAL
well placed and four wide down the backstretch, dropped back slightly angled in and saved ground through the turn, came through inside into the stretch,
then closed willingly and missed the place. ROLLING MO well placed and between rivals, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the
lane and flattened out. THISAINTJUMPSTREET broke a step slowly from the gate, made ground up through the turn, then edged ahead of a tiring rival.
YES IT'S ERIE well placed and five wide, lost ground three and four wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
MERINO WOOL tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, then made a steady gain and drove clear
late. CHECOTAH stalked the pace on the outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader gaining sway into the
stretch, shook clear, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. CONQUESTHARDCHERRY well placed, looped up three wide through
the turn, bid four wide into the stretch and flattened out. DAVE'S TEXAS LADY sprinted clear early, stayed on when challenged through the turn, then
weakened the final furlong. AMAZON LIZZIE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and could not gain.
WILD LOOKER mid pack, moved up inside through the turn, came through and weakened in the stretch. HOXIE was no factor. LACEE was never involved.

Footnotes
MUSIC AMORE sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. BACK
TO BUSINESS stalked the pace on the outside in the early going, dropped back slight angling in to save ground through turn, came through inside of rivals
into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room and closed for the place. SERENE WARRIOR rated in the early going, gained position into the second turn,
bid outside the leader into the stretch, then weakened the final furlong and held the show. MON PARADIS tracked the pace, saved ground through the
turns, angled four wide into the stretch and got up for a share. STARSHIP MACYS mid pack, gained position three wide through the second turn, bid on that
path into the lane and weakened. SUMMER HELPER was never involved. GOLDEN SWEETS was no factor.

Footnotes
HEY BIG GUY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and drew off late. EPIC (ARG)
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and closed well for the place. PIONEER DANCER well placed and outside,
gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. BOOMIN GOOSE stalked the pace
on the inside, edged ahead into the turn, then weakened the final furlong and held a share. ANOTHER SOFTBALL tracked the pace, saved ground through
the turn, came through inside of rivals and weakened the final furlong. POLLOCK set the early pace off the rail and faded through the turn. RED CAT (CHI)
was a brief factor.
