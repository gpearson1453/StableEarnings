Footnotes
JELLYBEAN was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, moved up two wide between rivals to challenge through the far turn, dug in inside the eighth pole
and proved best under strong handling. OTTER POP stalked the pace top pair down the back stretch, moved up three to four wide through the upper
stretch, took aim near the eighth pole but couldn't get by the winner to finish second best. FAST KIMMIE was bumped at the break, forced out soon after the
start by a Miss Grand Slam, settled off the early going, raced towards the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had not enough. RED
DELICIOUS dropped back early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. SARA KALI broke in, bumped at the break,
sent along to set the early pace and weakened in the drive. MISS GRAND SLAM veered out soon after the break, to race a bit greenly, settled off the early
going and never threatened. LUCKY GIRL COCO was off a bit slow, forced in at the break and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DADDY'S JOY pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the far turn, was well clear near the eighth pole and prevailed late
under strong encouragement. FILLMORE EAST stalked the early pace, moved up three wide near the quarter pole and finished gamely in the final stages to
close in on Daddy's Joy and just miss. SHEA ON A MISSION stalked the top trio early on, moved up four to five wide through the upper stretch and finished
willingly to the wire. AMERICAN EMPRESS set the early pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. BEAUTY GENIUS settled off the
early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no late rally. TRULY settled off the early pace, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch
and never threatened. LA RUSIA dropped back early and failed to respond.

Footnotes
NIKEE KAN showed good early speed from the inside and held gamely in the drive to remain clear under strong encouragement. SAMMY'S TOWN was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced three wide through the far turn and narrowly held the place position late. THE GREAT KATH was coaxed
along early, raced near the inside near the quarter pole, continued her bid from the rail in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. SARA MIA stalked the
pace from the outside, raced four wide into the stretch and had no final winning bid. MOON OF LOVE (IRE) was off a step slow, dropped back off the early
pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and had no late response. MUDSLIDE WICKED dropped back early, raced in a bit tight quarters briefly
near the three sixteenths pole, shifted out four wide and never threatened. SIREN'S LUCKY SONG dropped to back of the pack early on, saved ground and
had no response. SILVER TUNES showed good early speed while racing between rivals and faded.

Footnotes
FULL OF MISCHIEF stalked the pace from the outside, made a good four wide bid while racing between horses and just got up under strong handling.
DANLEY settled to the middle of the pack early on, moved up to make a good five wide bid in the drive and closed gamely to just miss. THE BEAST showed
good early speed, raced two to three wide and kept on to the wire. PIPITO settled off the early going, moved up four wide through the far turn, raced widest
through the lane and showed good late interest. CAN'T BE BROKEN stalked the early going, raced three to two wide and had not enough in the drive.
SNOW JOB pressed the early pace and weakened while racing near the rail. SHOT TIME was slow early, raced five wide and had no final winning bid.
NOBLE CROSS was allowed to settle off the early pace and failed to respond. FIRST LAW was always back and after pulling up had to be vanned off.
RUNAWAY TOM stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and tired. EXQUISITE DUDE was reluctant to load, was hustled along
between, forced to check early and retreated.

Footnotes
STEAL SUNSHINE stalked the early pace, made a good bide bid near the three eighths pole to challenge, raced four wide in the lane and finished well to be
a going away winner under steady handling. STORMY PATTERN bobbled at the break, was sent along to show good early foot, led inside the eighth pole
but was no match for the winner in the final staages. THE SKIPPER TOO pressed the early going, waited near the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail
through the far turn through the stretch and had not enough late. MORGAN POINT was allowed to settle early on, raced towards the inside and had no final
winning bid. GOD IS LOVE was slow early, raced four to five wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. DOUBLE PLAY KING broke to the
outside, stalked the pace, raced three wide near the quarter pole and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
BASILIA tracked the early leader down the backstretch, took command rounding the far turn, raced two deep and finished well to edge clear late under
strong pressure. FLASHY TOO stalked the pace, moved up three wide through the far turn, took aim near the eighth pole but couldn't match strides with the
winner to narrowly hold the place position. SINFULICIOUS was away slow, stalked the early going, raced three to four wide through the upper lane, shifted
in near the rail and kept on to the wire. LOUELLA STREET ran up heels into the first turn, settled to the middle of the pack, raced four wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had no late closing run. LILY'S LEAD settled off the pace, raced three wide and had no response in the drive. EISWEIN was unhurried
early on, raced towards the inside and never was a factor. LADY EMILY was allowed to settle early and failed to have a response. UP HER SLEEVE
showed good early speed to be the pace setter early on and gave way in the stretch run.
