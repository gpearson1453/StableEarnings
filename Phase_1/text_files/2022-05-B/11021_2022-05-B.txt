LARCH dueled outside of KING DEUCE for the early lead, battled on into the upper stretch, shook free past the furlong marker and edged away.
ITSALLABOUTYOU raced up close just off the embattled pair, launched a three wide bid in the upper stretch, raced in striking distance a furlong out but
could not reach the winner. NOT ROCKET SCIENCE was off slow at the start and raced in the back, hustled up three to four wide in the upper stretch and
gained a share. KING DEUCE dueled inside of LARCH for the early lead, battled back into the upper stretch, could not move on with the winner past the
furlong marker and steadily weakened. MATCHLOCK chased four wide in contention around the turn then flattened out in the lane.

settle for second best. LODE OF BLARNEY hustled along in steady pursuit, saved ground into the upper stretch and stayed on for a share. KILLEEN was

MR FROST sped to the lead soon after the start, widened to a clear advantage around the turn, pulled away to a commanding lead in the upper stretch and
kept to task under a mild drive. CHARLIE'S NO SAINT was forwardly placed sitting just off the early leader, was ridden along the rail into the stretch run,
was no late match for the winner but sustained steady response and finished clearly second best. MEET GEORGE JETSON was reserved racing in the
back, swung four wide into the upper stretch and gained a share. JOAN'S JUNIOR raced in range chasing three wide around the turn then came up empty
in the upper stretch. BLACKHEATH showed brief response in early stages then retreated.

Footnotes
HUMERO D'ORO rated just off the pace in early stages, launched a three wide bid mid-way around the far turn, swung four wide into the upper stretch, dug
in three deep under firm handling in late stages and edged away. NUGGET OF GRACE pressed the pace up the backstretch, vied for the lead with YOUNG
O' DAINE around the final turn, battled for command into the lane and got denied in deep stretch. YOUNG O' DAINE set a pressured pace up the
backstretch, vied with NUGGET OF GRACE around the far turn, battled on into the stretch run and yielded late. SUEZ broke out at the start, was unhurried
in the back, was ridden along the rail around the far turn, shifted two wide for the drive, tipped a path wider in deep stretch and just missed show. CODE
CLEAR raced off the pace, was ridden along three wide around the far turn and never threatened. DREAMER'S DELIGHT raced in early contention then
came up empty leaving the backstretch.

Footnotes
SABRIA tracked the top pair racing between foes entering the turn, came under a ride three wide going by the quarter pole, was set down three to four wide
for the drive, steadily edged up closer and got up in final strides. ZOFIA dueled outside of BAYLEYWICK for the early lead, continued to battle for command
into the stretch run, dug in gamely, shook free near the sixteenth pole then got edged out in final strides. BAYLEYWICK dueled inside of ZOFIA for the early
lead, continued to match strides into the lane and yielded in the final sixteenth. TAPTHATLUCK lacked speed and raced in the back, hustled up two wide
into the lane and had a mild improve. REBEL RISING chased three deep off the top flight entering the turn then gave way entering the lane. DARK
SILENCE raced up close along the rail in early stages then faded approaching the quarter pole.

Footnotes
SMART N INTUITIVE tracked the top pair in the early going, was ridden along the rail around the turn, advanced along the inside to engage the top pair at
the furlong marker, edged away to a slim lead then dueled noses apart with SHIP BOSS approaching the wire and nipped rival for the win. SHIP BOSS vied
for the early lead racing outside of MR. LOVEJOY, continued to battle for command into the stretch run, took on the added challenge of SMART N
INTUITIVE at the furlong marker, stayed on gamely and got nipped in final stride. JAYSKER tracked the top pair into the turn, swung four wide into the
upper stretch, sustained steady response and prevailed for a share. MR. LOVEJOY vied for the early lead racing inside of SHIP BOSS, fought back gamely
into the stretch run then came up empty in the final sixteenth. JOHN R raced in the last flight, came three to four wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. MAHOMES was ridden along off the early pace, chased three wide around the turn and failed to move on. YOU TALKIN TO ME was off a step
slow at the start, raced in the last flight, saved ground and had no response.
