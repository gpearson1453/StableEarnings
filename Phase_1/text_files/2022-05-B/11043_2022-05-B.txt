PERFECTINGTHEVIEW was in tight causing her rider to steady as the runner up angled in at the five eighths pole, stalked the pace three wide, responded
readily when set down to make the lead in upper stretch and finished full of run under a hand ride to win going away. WWINSPIRED broke in front then
angled in leaving the chute putting multiple rivals in tight, dueled for the lead two wide until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. LADY
DYANAFORMER tracked the pace four wide into the stretch and finished with good courage three deep. GOODNESS SAKES never far back, offered a mild
bid along the rail into the stretch then was outfinished. COWCHI failed to menace. CITY SIGNS also in tight at the five eighths pole, settled along the inside
well within striking distance, altered course sharply to the eight path in upper stretch and lost ground. LUCKY PENNY ROSE was no factor. LOLA LOUISE
set the early pace along the rail, had speed into the stretch then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
R THREE ANGELS had speed from the start along the rail, dropped back before a half, shifted out three wide before the far turn, surged to the front with a
rapid move in hand, was put to a right handed whip in upper stretch and drew off to win as much the best. RUNLIKEJACKIEO forwardly placed from the
start, rallied four deep through the far turn and finished second best. ARTIES CRYPTONITE allowed to settle, swung wide and improved position in the
eight path. THURSDAY FROST pressed the pace three wide around the clubhouse turn, made the lead, set the pace into the far turn then came up empty.
DANCING GRACE was no threat. LARSA broke in front, set the pace two wide through the opening turn, chased the pace into the far turn then gave way.
OPHA MAY was no factor.

C K'S LUCKY DUCK prompted the pace two wide into the stretch, inherited the lead, edged clear late and lasted under right handed urging. STONE COLD
CAT never far back, rallied determinedly two wide through the stretch and finished clear for second. DYNAMITE CLOUD stalked the pace three wide and
was outfinished. PRECIOUS JULES found his best stride late in the three path. MA MOO POWER failed to menace. OLE WATASHI saved ground and
faded in the stretch. ROLLIN ON TEQUILA stumbled out in front, set the pace along the rail into the stretch, lugged in and stopped.
