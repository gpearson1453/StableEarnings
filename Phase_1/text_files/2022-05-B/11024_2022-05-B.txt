ARRANGED VOWS set the pace racing off the rail, kicked clear in the stretch. ATHENA'S STORM pressed inside, switched out on the turn going roughly
two wide in pursuit of the winner, was no match and just held the place. RAISE OUR FLAG settled between rivals off the early pace, swung four wide into
the stretch, missed second. DOUBLE STORM stalked three wide, lacked the needed late kick. MAX A MILLION RSS raced on or just off the rail and was
never a threat. JEDI JENNIE raced outside foes going four wide on the turn and failed to rally. ZENMAGIC raced off the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
GUARDING ELK CAMP stalked three wide, moved to challenge into the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, drew clear and held safe while eased up late.
BLUE XCHANGE settled mid-pack three wide early, advanced past rivals heading into the far turn going three to four wide on that bend, gained the place.
LILA'S LUCKY LADY was caught four wide on the first turn, stalked up the backstretch, moved wider to come six deep into the stretch and improved
position. D'TATWAY tracked two to three wide early, swung out five deep turning for home and evened out in the lane. SUZY Q dueled outside two to three
wide, weakened. MCGOLDIE raced mostly two wide and failed to menace. GLOBAL EXCHANGE dueled inside on or just off the rail, gave way. CAROLS
BOUTIQUE was never a threat. MY EXPRESSION broke a step slowly and slightly steadied at the start, raced off the inside and failed to rally. HOT TO
SURF broke a step slowly, raced three wide early, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BURNZ DA BOSS was urged at the break, took the lead after the opening three-sixteenths inside rivals, moved clear late on the turn while coming out a
path, was kept to the task. HENNESSY'S SQUIRT stalked the leaders between rivals, went four wide on the turn, kept on to get up for second. LIFE
JACKET vied with the winner early, went two to three wide on the turn, lost place late. CHATTER BAR went six wide on the turn, was gaining too late.
GOGO OXBOW was mid-pack racing five wide on the turn, kept on in the lane. AUDACE shifted in, saved ground and gained mildly. LARRY'S LEGEND
was forwardly-placed early, went three wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. CANYON DEL ORO broke a half-step slowly at the start, saved ground
to no avail. MAJOR DAYLIGHT went three wide on the turn and was not a factor. ZIPPING BOMBASTIC chased four wide and between rivals, steadied
about the five-sixteenths and was getting out early on the turn, faded.
