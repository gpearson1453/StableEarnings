Footnotes
SHACKS WAY showed speed three deep down the backstretch, raced outside MAGIC MULE, dueled with that one through the stretch and determinedly
prevailed. MAGIC MULE , in the two path between horses the opening quarter mile, engaged the winner mid way on the turn, dueled through the lane and
just missed in a game effort. ABUELO PAPS , inside WHERE PARADISE LAY leaving the backstretch, brushed with that one entering the turn, swung to
the five path in upper stretch and rallied mildly outside the top pair. WHERE PARADISE LAY , four deep, brushed with ABUELO PAPS entering the turn,
remained wide on the turn and flattened out. SPITBALL lacked speed, swung to the six path in upper stretch and came up empty. ROYAL CRUSADER ,
wide on the turn, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch and was always outrun. ALIFEROUS , a forward factor along the inner rail leaving the
backstretch, steadied in close quarters inside MAGIC MULE entering the turn then retreated. An objection by the rider of ALIFEROUS against MAGIC
MULE for alleged interference entering the turn was not allowed.

Footnotes
BENANDJOE cleared early, set the pace towards the inside, dug in under pressure when confronted by rivals into the far turn, maintained a slim advantage
under a ride into the lane, shook clear a furlong out, wandered outward a bit under left handed asking and dug in gamely to prevail. SHOOGER RAY TOO
prompted the pace two wide, edged up between foes to threaten near the far turn, dropped back some under asking past the three eighths, shifted out four
wide for the drive and came back gamely to gain. GENTLEMAN JOE , bumped at the break, pulled his way forward three wide past the five eighths and
tracked the winner, moved outside foes to challenge around the far turn, battled outside BENANDJOE into the lane, failed to match strides near the eighth
pole then gave way grudgingly. ARMANDO R lost ground four wide through the backstretch run, was under asking pursuing past the five sixteenths, came
five wide into the lane, shifted in and kept on with some interest. THE POSER , in close soon after the break, was taken four wide and failed to respond.
HONOR THE FLEET was getting out around the first turn and steadied, raced in range between rivals leaving the far turn, failed to kick on entering the lane
and gave way. AIN'T DA BEER COLD saved ground pursuing the early pace, stayed on for five furlongs then steadily retreated.

Footnotes
AIRSPEED VELOCITY , clear soon after the break, moved over to the inner rail approaching the first turn, remained along the rail setting the pace, was
challenged by EVAN HARLAN in mid stretch, dug in when bumped by that one in deep stretch and narrowly prevailed. EVAN HARLAN bore out on
AMARILLO leaving the starting gate, was three deep both turns while stalking the pace, challenged for the lead in mid stretch and hung after drifting in and
bumping the winner in deep stretch. HARD TRAVELER saved ground on both turns while forwardly placed and closed ground late. GENERAL'S DUTY lost
ground on both turns, angled out in upper stretch and had a mild gain. BAD TO THE BONES , bumped by AMARILLO after breaking slowly, circled the far
turn three wide, angled to the five path in upper stretch and was no threat. VIOLENT ROCK chased the pace outside the winner to the stretch then
weakened. HACHURE , along the inner rail on the far turn, eased out in upper stretch and was not a factor. TRASH TALKIN LARRY was no factor.
SPIRITUAL GHOST was outrun. AMARILLO bumped BAD TO THE BONES when forced out by EVAN HARLAN leaving the starting gate, failed to be a
factor nd was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
JAXON TRAVELER broke sharply and set the early pace while handling some inside pressure from WAR TOCSIN, spurted away under rating near the
three eighths and dropped in, dug in when confronted by THREES OVER DEUCES soon into the lane, sparred on a short lead past mid stretch then edged
away late under steady hand encouragement. THREES OVER DEUCES , brushed at the break, edged up early and chased three wide, ranged up boldly to
join the winner in upper stretch, battled to the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. WAR TOCSIN rushed up to the inside of JAXON TRAVELER and
contested the early pace, rated back off that one nearing the turn, shifted out, pursued three to four wide into the lane and kept on with interest. SIR
ALFRED JAMES , brushed at the break, saved ground off the pace, eased out a bit to advance past mid stretch then continued on with effort to the inside of
WAR TOCSIN. FULL AUTHORITY stumbled badly at the break and was brushed, found himself well back into the turn, came four wide for the drive but
lacked a recovery. DISCO PHAROAH , brushed and pinched back at the break, gave four wide pursuit leaving the three eighths and faded.

Footnotes
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS (IRE) assumed the early lead, set the pace along the rail, responded when asked in upper stretch and drew off under intermittent
urging. CRYSTAL CLIFFS (FR) , in hand along the inner rail stalking the pace, eased out leaving the far turn, had aim on the lead in upper stretch, finished
willingly but was second best. IN A HURRY lacked speed, raced along the inner rail throughout and passed tired foes in the stretch. OUT OF SORTS lacked
speed, raced along the inner rail entering the stretch and was never a factor. KARAKATSIE lacked speed, offered a mild, three wide move mid way on the
far turn then weakened. FOGGY DREAMS chased the pace while in the two path then gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
GOLDEN VOICE settled in the clear and off the inside, edged up four wide into the far turn, responded when called upon and moved up into the lane to take
aim, forged to command nearing the furlong grounds, kept on under solid handling and held firm. KATE'S KINGDOM rated off the pace while saving ground,
eased out advancing leaving the far turn, worked between runners into the lane, dropped in to progress in mid stretch, kept on gamely and gained the place.
VIBRANCY rated comfortably and in range of a contested pace, took closer order into the far turn and angled three wide, bid to command with a furlong to
go, dug in when joined past the three sixteenths, fought on between rivals past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. FIRE IN THE HOLE settled well back
while behind a pair of runners, angled out leaving the far turn, circled five wide into the stretch and rallied. VOLADOR , four wide early, moved up three wide
into the far turn, chased four wide approaching the stretch then came up empty. WITTY BANTER , off the pace while saving ground, came out a bit near the
three sixteenths bumping with HASHTAG LUCKY, corrected but failed to seriously kick on. CANOODLE broke a step slow, raced three wide into the first
turn, remained off the rail and lacked a rally. TRUMPET LILLY sped up to the inside of HASHTAG LUCKY early on and gained the lead into the first turn, set
a solid pace, took more pressure into the far turn, stayed willingly to the quarter pole and gave way. HASHTAG LUCKY had speed and attended the pace
outside TRUMPET LILY, drew alongside into the far turn to battle, failed to kick on into the lane, tired and was bumped near the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
SET PIECE (GB) drifted in at the break and was off a bit slow, was rated well off the early pace while off the inside, edged up in hand behind a rival leaving
the three eighths, swung out five wide for the drive, closed sharply under left handed asking, surged outside rivals to take over with about seventy yards
remaining, cleared then was taken in hand for the final strides. TANGO TANGO TANGO secured the inside into the backstretch and raced under a snug
hold, took closer order leaving the three eighths, eased out into the lane, moved up to loom a presence past the furlong grounds, briefly challenged then
kept on gamely to earn the place. ATONE vied three wide outside ENGLISH BEE then cleared with six furlongs to go, set the pace slightly off the rail, came
under a ride soon into the lane, clung to the advantage past mid stretch, failed to contain the winner inside the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly.
BEACON HILL , three wide early, angled in through the backstretch, moved up near the five sixteenths, shifted out for room near the sixteenth pole and
churned on. ENGLISH BEE vied into the first turn then rated back and angled outside to stalk, moved up leaving the far turn, was under pressure pursuing
two wide into the lane, stayed on past mid stretch then faded. NATHAN DETROIT , off the pace while saving ground, came up empty. NOVO SOL (BRZ)
saved ground early, angled out for the backstretch run, pursued three wide into the far turn, was in range past the five sixteenths, lacked a punch soon into
the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
LIGHTENING LARRY prompted the pace outside COGBURN, gained a short lead approaching the eighth pole and prevailed in an extended drive.
COGBURN sprinted to the early lead, hugged the inner rail, finished gamely but failed to match strides with the winner. CHASING TIME lacked speed,
raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied. ALOTTAHOPE , jostled both sides leaving the starting
gate, was quickly taken to the inner rail, saved ground around the turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied. OLD HOMESTEAD , in the three path
chasing the pace around the turn, gave way in the drive. LITTLE VIC bumped with ALOTTAHOPE at the start, was three deep on the turn and weakened in
the stretch. WHELEN SPRINGS bumped with ALOTTAHOPE leaving the starting gate, was fanned six deep turning for home and failed to be a factor.
DOCTOR JEFF hugged the inner rail, chased the pace to the stretch, gave way and was eased.

Footnotes
JOE drafted in towards the rail early on and settled, edged up between runners heading to the far turn, moved back inside to gain, came back out and knifed
his way between foes to challenge with a quarter to go, dueled head to head and to the inside of READY TO PURRFORM from the top of thr stretch, gained
a slim advantage near the sixteenth pole, battled in close proximity under stout right handed asking and proved resolute to the wire. READY TO
PURRFORM rated kindly outside a rival and within range of a spirited pace battle, eased out three wide and took closer aim past the three eighths, bid to
challenge with a quarter to go, poked a head in front past the three sixteenths, dueled gamely outside the winner but just wasn't quite good enough. CRABS
N BEER settled off the pace while about three to four wide, steadily progressed leaving the far turn, gave chase of the leaders while four wide into the lane,
remained on his left lead and kept on willingly to bridge the gap. UNCAPTURED SPIRIT , away alertly, disputed the pace to the inside of EPIC LUCK, shook
clear around the final turn, was collared with a quarter to go and weakened in the final furlong. DETERMINED KINGDOM , sluggish from the gate, lagged
well back, angled out leaving the far turn, circled four wide and had some belated interest. SHAKE EM LOOSE broke a step slow, raced well back, traveled
between runners into the lane but lacked a bid. LOCAL MOTIVE saved ground while giving early pursuit, was under pressure near the three eighths and
dropped back. EPIC LUCK was sent up early and sparred outside UNCAPTURED SPIRIT, kept up the scrum to the three eighths, failed to kick on past the
five sixteenths and faltered.

Footnotes
ETHEREAL ROAD saved ground the first turn, eased off the rail mid way down the backstretch, circled horses the far turn, was fanned five deep turning for
home, swept to command approaching the eighth pole then drew off. B DAWK , taken to the three path entering the first turn, chased the pace, remained
three wide the far turn, was fanned four wide turning for home, weakened and raced on his left lead late. MR JEFFERSON lacked speed, raced in the two
path on the far turn, was along the inner rail in the stretch, altered course near the sixteenth pole and failed to menace. RUGGS bumped, by UNIKEE
leaving the starting gate, showed speed in the three path on the first turn, chased the pace to upper stretch and weakened. GOOD SKATE bore out at the
break, sped to the early lead, set the pace near the rail, gave way in upper stretch and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. UNIKEE bumped with RUGGS
leaving the starting gate, raced three wide the first turn, fanned five wide turning for home and tired. GOLDENIZE , steadied in close quarters approaching
the first turn, raced along the inner rail and retreated through the stretch. WRITEITONTHEICE , in tight quarters soon after the break, was rated back from

energy under left handed asking to the wire and held firm. SMOKIN' JAY , three wide early, chased while in the clear mid turn, shifted five wide for the drive,
closed steadily and got the bob for the place. SEVEN SCENTS had speed outside the winner, eased back off foes nearing the turn, angled four wide for the
drive, moved up past the eighth pole, kept on willingly but was out nodded for second. GRATEFUL BRED bid three wide between rivals early on, pressed
into the turn, saw the winner get away a bit into the lane, gave willing pursuit to mid stretch then faded. MR. HUSTLE , off the pace while three wide
between rivals, angled six wide for the drive but lacked a serious run. BANK saved ground without threatening. ARTHUR'S HOPE was rated back a bit after
the break, raced between runners nearing the turn, angled five wide and failed to make an impact. THE WOLFMAN , four deep early, shifted in around the
turn but was outrun. HOLLIS moved up outside rivals in the opening furlong to dispute the pace, raced three deep leaving the far turn, forced the issue
outside the winner into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch then stopped in the final seventy yards.

EARLY VOTING , away alertly, eased outside heading to the first turn and tracked ARMAGNAC under rating, moved up in hand to engage from the outside
with a half mile remaining, secured command approaching the stretch, kicked away after being set down, wandered outward under left handed rousing near
mid stretch, came in late and dug in to fend off EPICENTER. EPICENTER steadied when squeezed back in the opening furlong, regrouped and dropped in
towards the rail and settled off the pace, edged closer leaving the far turn, continued saving ground with an advance into the stretch, moved to be the
closest pursuer past the eighth pole, eased out late as the winner came in and finished gamely. CREATIVE MINISTER , well placed saving ground within
range of the leaders, crept closer into the far turn, angled out soon after to pursue, worked his way between rivals in mid stretch, kept on with interest but
was no match for the top pair. SECRET OATH , brushed at the break, checked sharply between rivals when put in tight by HAPPY JACK in the opening
sixteenth, recovered and was taken wide into the backstretch, lost ground four wide past the five eighths, circled five wide under pressure pursuing into the
lane but came up empty in the final furlong. SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING, carried out some early by HAPPY JACK, raced four wide around the first turn, was
under pressure three wide into the far turn, came back a bit between runners into the stretch, swung out past the three sixteenths but failed to generate the
needed finish. SIMPLIFICATION , up close two to three wide, was under heavy pressure chasing past the three eighths, swung out in upper stretch and
failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded. ARMAGNAC , keen early, cleared off heading to the first turn, set the pace two wide, was joined by the
winner near the half mile marker, stayed on to battle around the final turn, failed to match strides soon into the lane and gave way. HAPPY JACK crowded
foes in the opening furlong when racing erratically, exchanged a bump, raced three wide under pressure into the far turn and gave way. FENWICK broke
outward and brushed with SECRET OATH, was bumped while in close between runners early, failed to go on after a half mile and faltered.
