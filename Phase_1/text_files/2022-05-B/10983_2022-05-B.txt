Footnotes
EL PECADO pressed the pace two wide, took over leaving the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear in midstretch and held on under a steady drive. ANOTHER
DUKE raced off the pace three and four wide, kicked in in midstretch and was gaining fast late. THING was bumped at the start, tracked the pace from the
rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole, had aim outside of the winner in upper stretch but flattened out. KICK IN THE GAS chased the pace three and
four wide and lacked the needed rally. ASSERT DOMINANCE broke in and bumped THING at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. COLONEL
JACKSON set the pace along the rail and retreated nearing the lane. SMALL REASON was in range three and four wide and came up empty in the lane.
FORMAL TREASURE trailed throughout.

ICE was strung out five wide into the turn, and salvaged the show spot. RUTHLESS INTENT was outrun two wide. CHENTI was outrun inside. SUCH IS
LIFE vied early inside, and gave way after a half-mile. WIN NO JOKE vied outside SUCH IS LIFE to the turn, and retreated. GEPARD pursued the leaders
three wide to the turn, and was through before going a half. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
CREME CARAMEL lagged well back for a half-mile, advanced steadily on the turn while being guided out four wide, ran past JUANITA R to take over in
upper stretch and drew off under pressure. JUANITA R put away DIXIE DIVA and moved away on the turn, came into the stretch in the three-path, had no
answer for CREME CARAMEL soon after that, and ran on to remain clear of the rest. THE JOKES ON ME raced in range two to three wide to the stretch,
and lacked a solid bid. PRETTYASPINK was forwardly placed early, but had no rally. MYRA FLEENER bumped with STRAIGHT TO GO after the start, and
posed no threat. OLYMPIC FENCER was no factor four to five wide. PHONE A FRIEND was no factor. CROOKLYN raced far back outside. STRAIGHT TO
GO bumped with MYRA FLEENER after the start, and was done after six furlongs. DIXIE DIVA vied outside JUANITA R early, and was through on the turn.

SEVEN CHANNELS pressed the pace two wide, seized command in midstretch and drove clear late. DOMINATE THEMOMENT set the pace along the rail
under pressure from the winner, fought on inside of that foe past the sixteenth pole then lasted for the place. PERFORMING ARTS raced off the pace three
wide between foes around the first turn and two wide around the far turn and rallied between to just miss second. PUBLIC INFORMATION settled off the
pace while two and three wide and had a mild belated rally. SIGRUN FAST BOY tracked the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around the
far turn and weakened a bit in the lane. SHADY MCGEE (IRE) was off slow, raced four wide around both turns and never threatened. THRESHOLD stalked
the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. AZURE SKY had some speed three wide, stopped entering the far turn and was eased. THIS RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED WITH RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

wide between horses, could not go with the winner after a half-mile, and ran on clearly second best. PORK CHOP shifted out four wide around the turn, and
rallied on the far outside to pick up the show. ASTRAL WEEKS fanned five wide leaving the turn, and improved past tired horses. TOSCANITO sat behind
the leaders five wide into the turn, and flattened out in the drive. AMERICAN DOLLAR pressed the early pace two wide between horses, and faded after a
half-mile. MOCA MONSTER was never in the hunt. SHEA D CAPTURE was outrun four wide. EXTRACTION WILL vied early inside rivals, and faltered after

Footnotes
ANNA'S DREAM stalked the pace inside down the backstretch, drew clear along the rail around the turn, drifted out under left-handed urging in upper
stretch, straightened out under a solid hand ride and held clear. RESTLESS EYES raced off the pace four wide and rallied through the lane. RASPBERRY
BALLET saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. LI LI BEAR stalked the pace three wide and faded through the lane. BLUSTERY played no
factor while racing three wide. CHESS NOT CHECKERS bumped with STONE BEAUTY after the start, chased the pace three wide and tired in the drive.
AWESOME BIRDIE chased the pace inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole and came up empty. STONE BEAUTY bumped with CHESS NOT
CHECKERS after the start, set the early pace two wide and stopped after a half. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
ILLOGICAL LOVE sped clear early in the two-path, and maintained control through the stretch under a drive. MISZLO broke a step slow, lagged well back to
the stretch, and kicked in belatedly to get up for second. CODE NAME LISE was ridden along three wide on the turn, stayed on her left lead in the stretch
and needed more. HIGH ARABIAN bumped with CANDYMEISTER at the start, lacked room between horses turning for home, steadied in late traffic and
improved for the last major share. FOXY AUSTIN chased outside the winner to the stretch, and faded. SENORITA SALSA raced two to three wide on the
turn, and lacked a closing response. CANDYMEISTER bumped with HIGH ARABIAN at the start, and never menaced. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) chased early
inside, and tired after three-eighths of a mile. BROADWAY PEGGY broke poorly, and was outrun. V K STAR hit the right side of the gate at the start, and
trailed. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

nearing the eighth pole but kept trying inside of foes. MIDNIGHT BELLA was no threat while racing three and four wide. LADY DOMINANCE saved ground
well back, steadily angled out through the stretch and rallied belatedly. PASSION PLUS was in range inside, steadied near the quarter pole, bid nearing the
eighth pole and flattened out. SOUPER ALL STAR stalked the pace two wide and retreated around the far turn. CHICK'S SHADOW prompted the pace

Footnotes
SPIRIT WIND was content to let R ADIOS JERSEY go on with it up the backstretch, moved outside drawing a bead on that one into the turn, wrested
command a quarter-mile out and widened under a drive. RACE DAY SPEED broke slowly and raced well back early, rallied through between horses in deep
stretch and was up for second. COREY raced close up inside to the stretch, could not muster a threat to the winner, and was outfinished for the runner-up
spot. STARSHIP NALA was no factor three to four wide. DON'T GET KHOZY broke a step slow, and made no impact near the inside. R ADIOS JERSEY
sped away early, was no match for the winner turning for home and folded up. ONE IDENTITY tired after a half-mile three wide. MON PETIT CHOU was
never involved outside. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

ME AND MR. C settled off the pace along the inside, advanced four wide around the far turn, finished well outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole
and edged ahead. EAMONN bumped with MUNQAD at the start, tracked the pace two wide, bumped NOBLE INDY in upper stretch, brushed with CLEAR
VISION in midstretch and finished willingly between foes. HOT BLOODED dueled two wide to the sixteenth pole and was outfinished. CLEAR VISION
dueled inside to midstretch, brushed with EAMONN leaving the eighth pole and weakened. BETTERMENT saved ground in range and lacked the needed
rally. RISK MANAGER bumped after the start, saved ground well back, went two wide around the far turn and improved position. PARKLAND failed to
menace while racing three and four wide. MUNQAD was bumped at the start, raced well back two wide, went four wide around the far turn and never
threatened. MONAASIB bumped after the start, saved ground and made little further impact. PEACE OF EKATI was bumped after the start then squeezed
back soon after and played no factor while racing two and three wide. NOBLE INDY prompted the pace three wide, bid three deep near the quarter pole,
was bumped in upper stretch and was not urged from there. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY PRIDE advanced steadily after a half-mile, ranged up three wide at the top of the stretch, took over from SPLICER a furlong out and edged
away, then held FIRST GOLD safe to the finish. FIRST GOLD awaited room behind the leaders midway on the far turn, shifted out for clearance three wide
into the lane, and finished willingly outside the winner. SPLICER raced three wide, forged to the front after six furlongs, then yielded to KENTUCKY PRIDE
leaving the furlong grounds. PLAYA INCLUSION saved ground early, raced two wide on the far turn, and lacked the needed rally. FOR EVER OURS forced
the pace two to three wide, and weakened through the closing stages. BELLA SOFI was one-paced through a four-wide trip. BACKSTRETCHBEAUTY was
never prominent. CACTUS KITTEN was always outrun. ROYAL ROCKER established the early pace, and gave way before reaching the stretch. THIS
RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
