Footnotes
EVEN MONEY tracked the dueling pacesetters while near the inside, came off the rail approaching the far turn, stalked the duelers through mid-turn, moved
to challenge in the late turn, came into the lane three wide with momentum, gained the lead near the three-sixteenths pole, cleared before the eighth pole
then maintained the advantage under right-handed encouragement. MOTION TO ADJOURN vied for the lead along the inside throughout, shook off dueling
challenger while straightening in the lane, was passed by the winner soon after then kept on well to chase the top one home while finishing clear for the
place spot. WHISKY RIVERS stepped in at the start, raced two wide throughout then could not keep up with the top two through the final eighth. ONE FOR
THE MONEY was in the two path throughout and finished evenly. AIR PAYNTER was never a factor while in the two or three path through the turns.

path through the turn when trailing the small field, continued in the two path through the lane and moved up from the two path. INCREDIBLE JUSTICE was
in the four to the three path through the turn and lacked a response. E STREET ANGEL vied with the winner through the turn and into the lane, could not

SARGEANT BARGER saved ground through turns while never far back, bid into the lane from the two or three path, continued with momentum inside the
eighth pole , caught the leader late and cleared. DANNY'S LIL DANA stepped in start, bumped rival, rushed to the front into the first turn, continued on a
clear lead though the far turn and into the lane, was still clear with an eighth to go then yielded to the winner late. JACKS SPRING BREAK was bothered at
the start when inside and outside rivals converged, raced near the inside through the turn, shifted into the three path nearing the eighth pole then finished
evenly. ZIPPER ZAPPER broke to the outside, was bumped by another, steadied and settled to the back, raced near the rail through the turns and moved
up while not a threat. GET US ONE was in the four path throughout while never far back then tired. CINDY'S STORM chased the pacesetter from the three
to the two path into the far turn and was empty through the lane. THE QUARTER TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.
