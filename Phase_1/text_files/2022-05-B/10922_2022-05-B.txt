MASAI MAN sat back to turn, rallied into the stretch, ran off final furlong as much the best. SKYSWEPT brief speed to the turn, back off into stretch,
re-rallied for place spot. MIDLAND bobbled at the start, raced evenly with no late response in the stretch but secured the third spot. KOLTEN'S COURT
never reached a contending position. SIR NUISANCE failed to menace. DEVILISH TAIL dueled to the quarter pole, gave way readily and dropped back.
