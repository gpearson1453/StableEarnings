Footnotes
ELGAR dueled for the early lead along the inside under restraint, shook clear approaching the top of the stretch then widened the balance of the trip to win
easily. THE DRAKE stalked the pace into the stretch, was carried out to the seven path and finished second best. LUCKY ANDY saved ground and went
evenly. BLAZING DESIRE battled with the winner two wide into the turn, drifted to the six path entering the stretch then weakened. TRAMORE BAY threw
his head to the left as the gate opened missing the break and was no threat. DOBBYS SOCK was no factor. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY
SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

also made the lead briefly inside the furlong marker then was outfinished. MISTER MOBIL never far back, finished with good courage five wide. ROMANTIC
COWBOY stalked the pace along the rail for a half, inched closer near mid stretch then was outfinished. MIDNIGHT WARSHIP sped to a clear lead soon
after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then weakened. IT'S YOUR CALL steadied between rivals shortly after leaving the chute then was no factor.
