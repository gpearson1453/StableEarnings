early pace, moved closer two wide into the stretch then leveled off. EL MEZCALITO failed to menace. WHO CAN WIN had brief speed. BIG STOCK
WINNER contested the early lead along the rail, chased the pace through the turn then stopped.

HARD TO ACCESS pressed the pace three wide into the turn, gained a slight advantage, drifted out to the five pat at the furlong marker and edged clear
late under energetic handling. DARK TEMPTRESS waited inside, angled out on the turn, loomed boldly in the six path near mid stretch then was no match
for the winner. PLATINUM SKY pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then faded late. FRIDAY settled close up in the five path and went evenly.
LUCKY TO HAVE ME was no factor. PIPER broke in front, dropped to the rail, set a pressured pace into the turn then was used up.

INDIAN FEVER stalked the pace into the far turn, got through along the rail to make the lead near the five sixteenths pole, set the balance of the pace and
drew off under right handed urging. I WANNA WIN pressed the pace three wide and finished clear for second. GOING WITH STYLE never far back, passed
tiring rivals outside. SERVE REVENGE COLD failed to menace. PRIVATE DRIVE away alertly, set the pace into the far turn then weakened. OVER ICCE
checked repeatedly behind rivals on the first turn then was no threat.
