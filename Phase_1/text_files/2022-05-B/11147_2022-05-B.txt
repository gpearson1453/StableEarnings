Footnotes
SIXTH GEAR tracked just off the leaders inside, bid along the rail heading to the far turn, dueled while drifting five wide coming out of that bend, edged clear
and held. I'MAGAMBLER switched out early going three wide into the first turn, took closer order outside rivals five then four wide on the second turn,
finished up well but needed more. CURL raced forwardly three wide into the first turn, eased back and switched out to advance four wide into the far turn,
was carried six deep out of that bend, lacked the needed late kick. M T S RUNNER settled at the rear, passed rivals three wide on the far turn and improved
position. ELUSIVE ACCOUNTING caught four wide into the first turn, pressed the issue three deep late up the backstretch, faltered and faded. CASH
CRUZER shifted in two wide early, made no bid. CHA CHING CHARLIE set the pace racing off the rail, gave way.

HENRY ON THE RUN dueled inside a rival but off the fence, dispatched that one but faced a new challenger while drifting out a bit leaving the far turn,
turned back that one to prevail. OFFENSIVE raced four wide on the turns, made a bid at the top of the stretch but was held at bay. BOOMER WHO raced
three wide off the leaders early, advanced four then five wide on the far turn and improved position. TICO TIME stalked three wide, was between foes up the
backstretch, ran on evenly. AZTEC EMPEROR settled last but one, swung six wide into upper stretch and gained late. DIXIELAND DELIGHT raced off the
pace two wide early, moved out from four to six wide on the far turn and kept on evenly. REINING PESOS shifted in early, saved ground on both turns,
weakened. LOVER BOY BOB saved ground on or just off the rail, failed to rally. SKEETER WHO dueled outside the winner three to four wide, faltered and
faded. W F RIP TIDE was getting out on the first turn and subsequently outrun.

Footnotes
CORRINA CORRINA stumbled at the start and was then unhurried well off the leaders, moved outside three to four wide on the far turn, struck the lead just
outside the sixteenth pole, edged clear and held under steady handling. DIABOLICAL STORM pressed two wide, lost ground up the backstretch, came
again turning for home but was outkicked while gamely second best. MASSIVE ROAR set a pressured pace inside, edged clear late up the backstretch,
yielded when challenged again. BEAR CLAW stalked four wide early then three to four wide after, failed to rally. JET SET WARRIOR shifted in early, raced
two to three wide and improved. LONZO WHO saved ground early, came out four wide on the far turn advancing but could not sustain the effort. RIGHT
FOR YOU shifted in three then two wide on the first turn, raced three to four wide on the far turn and made no bid. BODIE GOT GOLD saved ground on the
first turn, moved out and went three to four wide on the second, was never near enough to threaten. AMERICAN SOLO was forwardly-placed three wide
early, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
SLY tracked off the leaders saving ground through all three turns, bid inside turning for home taking a narrow lead in the stretch, dug in to hold sway.
ZESTFUL pressed two wide, moved clear on the third turn, was overtaken in the stretch but fought on gamely and held the place. GODDARD stalked three
to four wide, was within contention and kept on but missed second. LIMONITE settled two to three wide and improved position. SIGALERT was
forwardly-placed three wide, lacked the needed late kick. WE'RE JUST SAYIN was unhurried in the early going, improved position. SKY JUMPER shifted in
racing near the inside, was not a factor. TIGER BY HIS TAIL set the pace inside, gave way. JET N G was not a factor. MIDNIGHT SPLIT was caught five
wide early, pulled up on the backstretch and walked off.
