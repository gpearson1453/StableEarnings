through the lane while under a strong hand drive. SHEZA HOOT set the pace into the backstretch, maintained a short advantage into late turn, chased the
winner through the turn and into the lane, stayed on through the lane to remained clear for the place spot while no match for the winner. LIGHTUPJUSTICE

pace along the inside into the far turn and never was a factor while losing ground. SWIFT TEMPLE was in the three path through the turns and lacked a
response. SHE RANUP THE AMEX pressed the pace three wide into the far turn then could not keep up after mid-turn.

Footnotes
VARTON was quickly clear soon after the start, widened through the turn while in the two path, was urged into the lane while in the four path, remained well
clear with an eighth to go then was kept to the task to hold. MAMA LOU trailed early while off the inside, advanced from the three path through the turn,
came into the lane from the five path and was under a drive inside the eighth pole to be up for the place spot. QUEEN BRIDGET chased the pace through
the turn while in the three path, continued in the lane from the five path and could not save the place spot late. GIFT WRAPPED chased the the winner
through the turn while in the two path, continued in the three path into the lane with aim on the top one then weakened. MOMOS HUMOR was never a
factor while near the inside. WILD TAPIT was in the four path through the turn and lacked a response.
