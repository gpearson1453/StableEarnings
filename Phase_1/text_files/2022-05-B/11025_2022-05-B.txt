Footnotes
JIBARO was away alertly to be soon well clear on the inside, then was kept to his task to remain clear to prove best. DISSECTOLOGIST chased the winner
throughout, made a mild bid three wide leaving the turn but flattened out, saved place award late. MENTORING was allowed to settle early and was three
wide on the turn, drifted out some in the drive while having a belated rally. HARDWARE GAP was reserved early and was between rivals at the three
eighths peg, then was two wide on the turn and offered no rally. NOT A GAME was off a beat slow, reserved on the inside and lacked a rally while saving
ground throughout. JIMMIES BIG DAY hit the gate at the start and was off slowly, relegated to the back early and was three wide by the three eighths and
was not a threat.

Footnotes
STYLISH GENT prompted the pace early three wide, then was reigned in to stalk the pace three to two wide on the turn, made a three wide bid leaving the
turn and wore down front runner late to get up under a drive. FRAMED set a pressured pace on the inside early, shook clear by the half mile marker and
remained clear leaving the turn, then dug in gamely through the stretch but was caught late. ICE ROAD was settled on the inside early, advanced on the
inside on the turn to move into contention, angled off the inside nearing the sixteenth marker for racing room and was slowly gaining late. REPEAT THE
HEAT was allowed to settle early, made a four to three wide move on the turn to move into contention leaving the turn, but needed more late.
DOINGGOODTROUBLE was rated three wide on the turn, came five wide into the drive and offered a belated rally. KLIMTOGLORY tracked the pace three
wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive and was empty. I AM RESILIENT lacked a rally. TARADAR failed to menace.

Footnotes
VEERY was away sharp early, had the lead on the turn, repelled a challenge at the quarter pole and drew away. TICKLE HER TOE settled on the rail in
midpack on the backside,angled out three wide on mid turn and finished with energy. KNOW HOW (GB) was stalking the leader early on and through the
turn, made a bid at the quarter pole and faded to lose place. KIMONO KATE broke slowly and was allowed to relax on backside then angled out for the drive
while finishing willingly. ICE FLOE broke sharp and rated in the early going, was asked on turn and finished evenly. SPICE IN YUH LIFE was behind leaders
early, inside going into the turn then drifted out mid turn under right handed urging and faded final eighth. BETTABE SWIFT hopped and brushed the gate at
the start and never reached contention.

bob for the place award. FULL SCREEN set the early pace towards the inside, eased off the inside on the turn and came three wide into the lane, dug in
gamely but could not go with the winner in the final furlong, lost place award on the wire. PERFECT CRIME was bumped at the start, reserved early, came
four to five wide into the lane, was advancing in traffic by the furlong marker, angled out nearing the sixteenth marker and had a late rally. LONG POND

WINSTON BLUE stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn, drifted out through the lane and held sway late to prove best under a
drive. HALL OF DREAMS was well rated three wide and made a four wide bid leaving the turn and then was carried out in the lane and hung to just miss.
GUARD OF HONOUR was well placed early while getting to the inside, saved ground to leaving the far turn, angled out for racing room and kept on but
needed more. MAD MOCHA was checked between horses on the first turn, then checked again leaving the eleven sixteenths, then once clear finished well
towards the inside in the lane. BRINGER OF RAIN was allowed to settle early and made a four wide move on the far turn but finished evenly late. TUFF

the lane. READY FOR THE LADY was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn and tipped out for the drive and had no rally. CITY LEGEND

SKYWIRE was allowed to settle early and was three wide on th backstretch, made a four wide move leaving the turn and kicked clear in the final furlong to
prove best under a drive. HELIUM chased the early pace and made a bid three wide to vie for command leaving the furlong marker but could not go with the
winner late while saving the place award. SIR SAHIB was reserved early and saved ground to the upper stretch, tipped out three wide and finished well to
just miss the place award. BRIGHT DEVIL (IRE) steadied into the first turn on the inside, then was between horses on the backstretch , remained between
rivals on the turn and swung out five wide for the drive but had no late kick. ENGLISH CONQUEROR was settled back early, advanced four wide on the turn
and was five wide by the quarter pole, came six wide into the lane and a late rally. BURNING MAN was void of early speed, then was four wide by the
quarter pole and swung out widest for the drive and had a belated rally. HARLAN ESTATE was allowed to settle on the inside and tipped out two wide for
the drive and had no rally. MALIBU SECRET set the early pace on the inside and then drew off on the backstretch, was headed nearing the furlong marker

Footnotes
MANNIX (IRE) was rated along early, then went up between horses on the backstretch, remained in between on the turn and was boxed from the quarter
pole to the furlong marker, shifted out to make room and made a bid and edged clear to prove best under a drive. CONGLOMERATE was reserved early
between rivals, eased out on the turn and came widest into the lane and closed well. KEEP GRINDING was four wide into the first turn, tracked the pace
three wide and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole to gain command leaving the three sixteenths but flattened out, held show award.
SHANGASSAH was reserved early and raced four wide on the backstretch, made a four to five wide move on the turn but hung late. EMBRACE MY UNCLE
prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn and then was empty in the drive. BREAKING ALONE was well placed on the inside
and weakened. MAMBOINTHEFOREST set the early pace and was headed on the inside and gave way. COLLECTIVE FORCE was allowed to settle on
the inside and clipped heels on the turn and lost the rider, walked off. MASTER MCGRATH was reserved on the inside, then trying to avoid the spill the
jockey fell off on the turn, walked off. The Stewards posted the INQUIRY concerning the run on the turn but after reviewing the replays the race was left as
is.

Footnotes
EMPRESS TIGRESS settled off the pace in the earlier stages while three wide, made a bid at the quarter pole and drew away convincingly. EGBERT J was
outpaced in the early stages and was allowed to rate on the inside, angled out for the stretch drive and was a clear second. I'M INTO MISCHIEF showed
speed down the backstretch, was pressed by the winner at the quarter pole and was outrun through the stretch. NO MORE DIAMONDS broke well and fell
behind early, offered a mild rally while three wide on the turn and never threatened. I HAVE AN IDEA was asked early down the backside and offered little.
A. A. SWEET CHILLI stalked inside, was roused on the turn and weakened in the stretch. SHEBATOWN was off a step slow, rated near the rear and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
WENJACK angled off the inside early to stalked the pace three wide, made a bid nearing the quarter pole and took over leaving the turn and was clear by
the furlong marker, then kept a safe margin to the wire under left handed crop urging. TARA TATTOO was settled back early, advanced three wide on the
turn and came four wide into the drive, closed well under left handed crop urging despite being on the left lead. SUPER BREW was settled back early and
was on the inside on the turn, angled out for racing room leaving the turn and rallied. SPEED WAY steadied early, then was settled early and was two wide
on the turn, shifted out leaving the three sixteenths and had a mild late rally. COO BIRD was settled back early, came five wide into the lane and offered a
late rally. WILD RIVER WOLF vied for the early lead three wide, then went on to set the pace while clear and move to the inside, then had nothing left in the
final furlong. HIGHLAND SOCIETY tracked the pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn and then was empty in the drive. COUSIN BOB was
settled back early and was on the inside on the turn and had no rally. JUST START ME UP vied for the early lead two wide and then weakened on the turn.
BOCELLI had no speed and showed little. BLUE SNOW chased the early pace three wide and in between rivals and stopped, eased late.
