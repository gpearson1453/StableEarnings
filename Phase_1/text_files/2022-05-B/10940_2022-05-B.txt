Footnotes
FIBER STRONG rated a slim lead, contested the edge two deep on the turn, dug in under mostly a vigorous hand ride leaving the turn and cleared REMYS
SHOWTIME later yards. The latter pressed the pace, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn and remained a factor to mid-stretch
before relenting. SHOWTIME CAT chased inside, rounded the turn off the rail, eased out entering the stretch and finished well to gain on the runner-up.
NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE hopped at the break then gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little more. FOREVER TAKES TIME gave close
early chase, rounded the turn about the three path then drifted into the stretch and weakened.

under pressure nearing the quarter pole, widened at the rail on the far turn but was caught flattening stride the final yards. REGHITTO settled off the pace

Footnotes
TRUE FLIRT closed to the front nearing the five sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met approaching the head of the lane but dug in under
determined handling to eke out the nod over the game stretch effort of YESSIROFFICER, who pressured the pace from the five sixteenths pole and dueled
to even terms at the rail on the turn, took the edge leaving the turn and dug in gamely under steady stretch handling, but missed the nod under the wire.
GET LUCKY broke awkwardly then angled to the outside to give chase, ran in the six path of the turn, finished well and was gaining on the top two. ON IT
chased, rounded the turn off the rail then flattened in the lane. SILVER RULES gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and showed little in the
lane. LEMONSONDESURPRISE set the pace most of the opening quarter mile, gave chase nearing the five sixteenths pole but dropped back at the rail
midway on the turn and weakened in the stretch. IT'S A REAL HONOR came away awkwardly and hit the stall gate, gave chase inside and rounded the turn
near the rail.
