Footnotes
SNARK broke awkwardly to come away a step slow, hustled after then lacked room to advance crossing the dirt, sat off the pace, swung out into the stretch,
rallied to the front in the final sixteenth and prevailed over the runner-up. ENCOLPION came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, lost her path early,
dropped back to last enter outside a pair of rivals leaving the backstretch, swung widest at the top of the stretch, rallied through the final furlong but was
outclosed by the winner. REAL FIRE broke out and bumped rival, went up to vie three deep for command, remained close up outside the top pair around the
turn, bid three deep and between rivals at the eighth pole but got outkicked. BELLE CHERIE was off a bit slow from outside, pulled early while attending the
pace four deep, chased four wide into the stretch, re-engaged the leaders at the eighth pole, led in midstretch but faltered late. ALBAYAADER (IRE) broke
slow, got bumped from both sides and pinched back at the start, advanced on the inside around the turn, lacked room past the quarter pole and remained a
behind a wall of rivals to midstretch, tipped out to a clear path but could not regain momentum. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) away well to take the front quickly,
vied between rivals up the backstretch, dueled outside SECRET FIX on the turn, clung to a narrow lead approaching the eighth pole, relinquished command
shortly after and flattened late. SECRET FIX went up to contest the pace from inside, dueled around the turn, fought to midstretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ARDIS sped clear from the rail, set the pace up the backstretch, opened up on the far turn and was kept to task with through the lane to win comfortably. SO
SOFTLY chased three then four wide while outside a rival on the clubhouse turn, asked two wide on the far turn while closest in pursuit, could not threaten
the winner in the lane but was clearly second best. QUEEN OF LOVE chased in the two path through both turns and weakened in the late stages.
HARDDIANE stumbled a bit leaving the gate, went three wide into the first turn then steered to the two path, angled out on the far turn then came back to
the inside leaving the bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
DEL MAR DRAMA hopped a bit at the start but still came away fairly close, hustled to the front with EMPIRE PASS to the outside, cleared that rival near the
half-mile pole, saved ground through the turn, urged right-handed in upper stretch and drew away under strong handling. DANCING DANA broke well from
the inside, took an awkward step crossing onto the dirt, stalked along the inside then eased out to the three path on the turn, took aim from outside in upper
stretch but needed to find more in the final furlong. EMPIRE PASS showed early speed from outside, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, took the turn
two wide and flattened. KEEP DANCING was off slow to begin, trailed along the inside to the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BIG SCOTT DADDY trailed early under urging, went four wide into the turn, steered down to the two path, tipped out in upper stretch, closed from outside
and surged late to get up in time. PYEONG CHANG hustled clear early, showed the way along the inside while inching away on the turn, continued clear
into deep stretch but got run down by the winner in the closing moments. SUPERMAN SHAQ broke out a bit but was quickly corrected, chased along the
inside then moved to the two path around the bend, finished willingly through the lane but could only whittle the gap late. OLYMPIC LEGEND tracked off the
rail, went three wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and flattened out. CATBERNAY broke out and bumped, chased outside a rival up the
backstretch, rounded to the turn three wide and weakened. STAR ENTRY took a bumped from inside leaving the gate, raced off the rail then angled to the
rail on the turn, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
FRONTIER MARKET sat well off the pace on the inside, moved into the two path and went between rivals on the backstretch, remained two wide to the
stretch, tipped out in the lane, rallied to the front with a sixteenth remaining and held gamely over the runner-up. MOVE OVER (GB) unhurried in the
beginning, traveled two wide then three deep on the backstretch and far turn, rallied from outside in tandem with FRONTIER MARKET and got outclosed in
deep stretch. PROUD PEDRO (FR) was off a bit slow to start, pulled along the inside into the first turn, moved out to the two path while trailing on the far
turn, steered out in the stretch and got for the show. VIA EGNATIA sped to the front and crossed over to the inside, opened up a comfortable lead, remained
well in control into the stretch, led clear to midstretch then folded in the final sixteenth. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) stalked in the two path early, was closest in
pursuit up the backstretch, moved to the inside then raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out in the drive and could not find more in the furlong
grounds. STEPHEN JAMES chased the lead from inside off the pace, cut the corner into the stretch and lacked the needed response. WAR TREATY drifted
out wide and was eased on the first turn, pulled up on the backstretch and walked off.

Footnotes
DIVINE ARMOR tracked three then two wide around the first turn, moved closer three deep into the far turn, bid from outside with a quarter mile left to run,
took over shortly after, fought with CONUNDRUM in upper stretch, then disposed of that rival in midstretch and drew off. CONUNDRUM stalked along the
inside, launched a rail bid at the quarter pole, challenge DIVINE ARMOR in upper stretch but was no match inside the furlong grounds. ALL FOUR WINDS
broke out then went to the front, set the pace in the two path, traveled a bit off the rail into the far turn then clung to the a short lead in the two path with a
quarter mile remaining, relinquished command late on the bend, then weakened to third. BRAVESTONE started to move just before the start then broke
slow when the gates opened, steadied off heels into the first turn, waited behind a trio of rivals entering the second bend, tipped out and came four wide into
the drive and lacked a rally. PAPALE fractious in the gate, came away slow, went four wide into the first turn then moved to the three path, raced outside the
leader on the backstretch, coaxed between rivals on the far turn, then lost position around that bend and weakened.

Footnotes
HEAVEN'S MUSIC pressed the pace from outside early, lost touch with the leader leaving the backstretch, put to a drive on the far turn and chased two
wide into the lane, drew alongside with a furlong left to run, dueled late and dug in to edge the runner-up. POSEIDON'S KID set the pace on the inside
under pressure, cleared at the seven-sixteenths pole, led a bit off the rail into the lane, drifted in to the inside in upper stretch, fought with HEAVEN'S
MUSIC in the final furlong and yielded grudingly. HOTROD RIDE was off a bit slow to begin, traveled five wide around the first turn, remained wide through
the second bend and rallied to edge SIPPIN N KISSIN for the show honors. SIPPIN N KISSIN angled in on the first turn and took a stalking position, put in a
rail bid at the top of the lane but got impeded by POSEIDON'S KID and had to check hard, tipped out to a clear path and got edged for the show. TAKE THE
TWO TEN bumped with rival while three deep into the first turn, chased four wide on the second bend, got crowded between rivals in upper stretch and
could not rally after. VANISKY bumped with TAKE THE TWO TEN while four deep entering the first turn, settled off the rail in mid-pack, went two wide into
the stretch and lacked further response. ARMAVEER came away slow then had to take up shortly after the start and became rank early, went three wide
around the first turn, moved into the two path and failed to make an impact. DOYOUSTILLLOVEME flashed early speed from outside and went five wide into
the first turn then angled in some and chased the top pair leaving the bend, traveled three deep on the second bend and weakened. BEL RAGAZZO
stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace then moved closer from inside up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and had little left for the drive.
FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED POSEIDON'S KID FROM SECOND TO FOURTH FOR SHIFTING INTO THE PATH OF
SIPPIN N KISSIN IN UPPER STRETCH, CAUSING THAT RIVAL TO CHECK SHARPLY AND COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
UNFAITHFUL WAYS got crowded between rivals and suffered a mild shuffle early, rated outside a rival at the back early on, angled out on the second bend
and went four wide into the lane, flew late and inhaled the GHOSTEM in the final strides. GHOSTEM set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, remained
clear into the final sixteenth and got run down nearing the wire. WITCH MOON angled to the inside and was unhurried at the back, angled out and came
three wide into the stretch, steered widest in the drive and closed well for the show. NOBLE HEARTED stalked the pace outside a rival, took aim two wide
into the stretch, moved out a bit at the top of the lane then came back in and lacked the needed late kick in deep stretch. ICE QUEEN tracked a bit off the
rail on the first turn, went two wide and raced in a bit tight midway on the second turn, continued two wide into lane and could not rally.
TMORROWISALONGTIME sat off the pace outside a rival, went three wide into the lane and faltered late. TRAVEL SMART stalked in the two path then
moved to the rail on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and weakened.
