Footnotes
BRANDON'SMYLAWYER away well from outside, showed early speed then pressed in hand from outside, drifted out a bit leaving the dirt then bobbled
shortly after crossing onto the grass, took over in upper stretch, cleared at the eighth pole and held safely. LOVAMOUR (FR) chased along the rail into the
turn, two wide crossing the dirt, tipped to the outside in upper stretch, finished willingly but could not get to the winner. I GOT A GAL set the pace under
pressure from the winner, held a short lead into the lane, lost command in upper stretch, flattened in deep stretch but managed to save the show. ANNIE'S
SONG (IRE) chased outside a rival early, came four wide into the stretch and missed the show. FORTUNATA TENSIO got crowded between and put in a bit
tight early, raced off the pace three wide into the turn, angled down to the inside around the bend, steered out in the stretch and lacked a rally. SEA
BREEZING (IRE) threw head soon after the start, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the bend while outside a rival, moved out
crossing the dirt and trailed five wide into the stretch and had little left.

ALL DIALED IN unhurried in the beginning, traveled two then three wide on the first turn, went around rivals four then three wide on the far turn while
gaining on the leaders, drew alongside RACE JUDICATA in midstretch and drove past late. RACE JUDICATA away quickly from outside, prompted the
pace alongside KITTEN'S KID, headed that rival past the three-eighths pole, took over midway around the bend, inched ahead with a quarter mile left to run,
put away inner rival in upper stretch but could not hold off ALL DIALED IN. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH settled a bit off the rail early on, traveled along the rail
into the far turn, tipped two wide into the stretch, took aim in the drive but faltered inside the furlong grounds. KITTEN'S KID took control while pressured by
RACE JUDICATA on the outside, received challenge past the three-eighths pole, lost command past the five-sixteenths but fought on to the stretch, then
gave way in the lane. SIDEWAYS SUANCES suffered a mild shuffle early then angled out to the three path entering the clubhouse turn, stalked the top pair
from off the rail, dropped back to last on the far turn and came four wide into the lane and was not persevered with.

BRAN (FR) sped to the front while pressured by BURNIN TURF early, moved clear from that rival past the quarter pole, led along the inside then two wide
into the stretch, remained clear under right-handed urging through the lane and held gamely. MAJESTIC EAGLE settled outside a rival, traveled two wide
around the bend, moved out crossing the dirt, finished willingly four wide in the drive and gained the place. BURNIN TURF pressed the pace early from
inside then ceded control to BRAN (FR) past the quarter pole, stalked two then three wide around the turn, chased behind the leader through the stretch
run, could not summon the needed late kick and got edged for second. HOMER SCREEN (BRZ) was off a bit slow to begin, tracked along inside and saved
ground through the turn, chased within striking distance along the fence but failed to find the needed final kick in deep stretch. KANDEREL broke a bit slow
from outside, went three wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked further response.

took a narrow lead and brushed in upper stretch, battled outside PRINCIPE CARLO down the lane and gamely prevailed. PRINCIPE CARLO pressed the
pace from outside, inched ahead past the five-sixteenths pole, led two wide into the drive, overtaken by AMERICAN THEOREM and brushed in upper

Footnotes
BALLADEER prompted the pace from outside, chased the leader past the half-mile pole, re-engaged midway around the far turn, took over past the quarter
pole, fought with the runner-up in the stretch and edged clear late. MIGRATION tracked three wide early, bid three deep around the far turn, challenged
BALLADEER through the lane and was turned away late. KAZUHIKO (AUS) drifted in and bumped rival early, chased between rivals, raced along the rail
then two to three wide into the stretch, tipped out in the lane, could not summon the needed late kick but held the show. BALDORO settled early and angled
off the rail on the clubhouse turn, raced outside a rival up the backstretch, came out on the second bend and entered the stretch five wide and got outkicked
for the show honors. PIROLI got floated wide by BALDORO on the first turn then angled back to the inside around the bend, steered out in the stretch but
failed to threaten. LAW ABIDING rated early and went three deep around the clubhouse turn, moved down to the two path, gained while angling out to the
four path on the second bend but weakened in the stretch. BIRTH OF COOL got bumped from outside and crowded between rivals soon after the start,
settled on the inside, moved closer up the backstretch, tipped two wide in upper stretch and also weakened. PRACTICAL IMPACT was off slow in the
beginning, trailed two wide early, angled out and came four wide into the drive and had little left. CONCH DADDY took control early under pressure, cleared
briefly past the half-mile pole, challenged again by BALLADEER on the far turn, lost command late on the turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
CAIRO MEMORIES raced up close outside the leader then moved back to stalk around the clubhouse turn and steered to the inside, tipped to the two path
for the far turn, bid from outside then vied between into the stretch, dueled with ISLAND OF LOVE (IRE) down the lane and drew clear late to prove best.
ISLAND OF LOVE (IRE) rated early and moved to the two path, tipped out and bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run, dueled outside CAIRO
MEMORIES in the stretch and faltered in the final sixteenth. BALLET DANCING was off slow and steadied when losing her path at the start, traveled
outside a rival into the first turn then angled down to the rail around that bend, moved closer up the backstretch, chased in range through the far turn and
finished evenly in the furlong grounds. STERLING CREST (IRE) away quickly and crossed over to the inside, cleared from CAIRO MEMORIES on the first
turn, showed the way up the backstretch, took pressure at the five-sixteenths pole, vied with a pair of rivals into the stretch, got crowded by CAIRO
MEMORIES in upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. ELLAMIRA broke outward leaving the gate, saved ground trailing the field and failed to
threaten. GOLD DRAGON QUEEN settled off the pace in the two path, entered the lane three wide and faded.

Footnotes
STAY HAPPY pressed the pace between early, dueled outside on the turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely.
ALLEVA showed early speed six deep, chased the top pair around the turn six then five wide, kept on willingly and got up for the place. REBEL WAR
showed early speed three deep, chased the top pair three wide around the bend, drifted inward in the stretch and finished evenly through the final furlong.
FACTS MATTER sped to the front from the inside, vied with outside rivals up the backstretch, dueled with the winner around the turn, lost touch at the top of
the lane and flattened to fourth. BEAR CHUM (AUS) broke slow, trailed along the inside, lacked room and had to steady past the quarter pole and improved
position. PRINCE RICKY bumped with outside rival and checked between early, went two wide into the turn, a bit off the rail into the stretch and lacked a
rally. STORMINSIDE got bumped and crowded early, split foes at the quarter pole, angled out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CIRCLE WEST
brushed with inner rival at the start, raced up close five deep early, could not keep pace into the turn, chased between and was forced to check at the
quarter pole, exited the bend six wide and had little left for the drive. RESTORING DREAMS brushed with CIRCLE WEST at the start, vied four deep early
on, chased four wide and shifted at the quarter pole, tired and eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) sped clear, opened up on the backstretch, padded the lead on the far turn, drifted out the lane and won easily. EVER SMART
brushed leaving the gate, tracked three then two wide early, got blocked behind rival leaving the backstretch and altered in entering the turn, steered back
out and came four wide into the stretch, then whittled the gap late on the runway winner. HEATHERS GREY bumped with rival entering the clubhouse turn,
chased along the inside then moved two path, stayed two wide to the stretch and held the show. DRAMATIZER got bumped from outside leaving the gate,
settled in the two path early, saved ground around the far turn, tipped out in the stretch and improved position. MISS MATTIE B got sandwiched leaving the
gate, went three wide around the first turn, traveled in the second flight, raced two then three wide on the second bend, moved out in the lane and could not
rally. APPLECROSS (IRE) bumped with inner rival entering the first turn, was closest in pursuit through the far turn and into the stretch and weakened in the
drive. KLEEN KARMA got bumped and had to check off heels into the first turn, boxed in from the seven-sixteenths pole to the three-eighths, went two wide
into the drive and could not rally. CONSTERNATION (IRE) drifted out and bumped rival into the first turn, got put in tight and checked approaching the
five-sixteenths pole, stayed inside to the stretch and came up empty. AAS DE FAUST (GB) off slow from outside, went four then three wide on the first turn,
remained off the rail and came five wide into the stretch and was never a factor. SHVERE ARBETER veered in and bumped rival leaving the gate, forwardly
placed four then three wide on the first turn, dropped back on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
