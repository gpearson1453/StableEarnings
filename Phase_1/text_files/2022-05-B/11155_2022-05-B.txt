Footnotes
FRONT OF LINE (GB) was forwardly placed to the first turn, advanced into the backstretch run and confronted LUCKY LARA and dueled with that one to
the half-mile marker, repelled a challenge from DARK INTENT leaving the quarter pole, extended the lead in upper stretch and won in a drive in the end.
CYCLONE SLEW saved all of the ground while settling just off of the early pace, advanced on the second turn, ran evenly to the stretch and was outfinished
in the final stages but was best of the rest. DARK INTENT was unhurried early on, was roused along the second turn and made a two wide bid nearing the
quarter marker to vie for the lead, was outkicked in upper stretch but was well clear of the rest for third. LADY SKYWALKER came two to three wide on the
first turn while just off of the early pace, was keen to go on through the backstretch run while just off of the pace, came four then two wide on the second
turn while improving position but could not sustain that run and tired late. LUCKY LARA was sent leaving the break, set the pace along the first turn, was
confronted by FRONT OF LINE leaving the first turn and dueled with that rival to the half-mile marker, dropped back leaving the three furlong marker, was
eased through the stretch and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
FASCINATED was hard sent leaving the start, made his way to the front and set quick fractions through the turn, was set down for the drive, felt mild late
pressure from the runner-up but held safely in the end. SUMMANUS settled off of the early pace, advanced on the turn while outside of rivals, made a
steady gain inside of the furlong grounds and could not reel in the winner in the end but was best of the rest. RHODIUM RUNNER was sent leaving the
break and tracked the quick pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and was outfinished in the end, while holding for third. HANS GRUBER
chased the quick pace from an inside path, was a bit eager and came to be in tight nearing the quarter marker, found room in upper stretch and weakened
in the late stages. I GOT SPEED broke alertly but was outrun in the first furlong, trailed through the turn and was not a factor.

MARY MARGARET was unprepared at the start and was away slowly, recovered nicely to be just off of the pace into the turn, shifted out from the rail to go
two wide nearing the quarter marker, dueled with APPLAUD THE BENCH to the eighth pole, shook free of that foe and drew clear in the end. APPLAUD
THE BENCH was sent leaving the break and set the pace to the turn, was confronted by MARY MARGARET nearing the quarter marker, dueled with the
winner to the furlong grounds, was outkicked in the final furlong but was an easy second over the rest. ARISTEIA chased the pace to the turn, lost position
nearing the quarter marker while four wide and gave way in the drive. CLOSED CIRCUIT was up close into the turn, lost ground while three wide nearing
the quarter pole, was outrun in upper stretch and faded late.

DUB TOWN settled in the midpack while saving ground, was roused along the second turn to go four wide into the drive, made a steady gain through the
stretch, overtook MAXINAMILLION nearing the sixteenth-marker and edged clear in the end. MAXINAMILLION settled off of the solid early pace while in
midflight, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, struck the front in upper stretch, could not hold off DUB TOWN in the final stages and was
outfinished, while clear for second. BROKEN FINGER was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground through the second turn, advanced in upper
stretch along the inside and was outkicked the late going, while clear for third. AWE was away a bit slowly and was unhurried early on, was roused along the
second turn and made a five wide bid into the stretch run but flattened in that effort in the late stages. UNPOSSIBLE was hustled leaving the start, disputed
the solid pace with KING EDDIE through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened late. KING EDDIE was sent leaving the break and
engaged with UNPOSSIBLE to contest the solid pace through the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE broke alertly and was sent in hand to the front, was engaged along the backstretch run while setting modest fractions, shook clear
along the far turn, came under pressure in midstretch, was put to firm encouragement, dug in late and edged clear in the end. STRAUS'S PLACE saved
ground while stalking the pace from the midflight, was roused while two wide into the drive, advanced on the winner nearing the eighth pole, was repelled in
that effort and outkicked in the final stages but kept on to get the nod for second. THEULTIMATEPRAISE was crowded at the start and was away a bit
slowly, was unhurried while saving ground through the second turn, mounted a rail bid through the drive, was outfinished and was just edged for second in
the end. COOL ACCLAIM was rank entering the first turn, went three wide into the backstretch run while continuing to be hard to place, steadied
approaching the three-furlong marker, lost position outside of rivals on the second turn and gave way in the end. FROMAJACKTOAKING was forwardly
placed early on, advanced on the pacesetter along the backstretch run, lost ground while two to three wide on the far turn and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
WARRIOR'S MOON was content to settle in the early stages, was roused while three wide nearing the quarter marker, circled the field to go four wide into
the drive, overtook HOLY ZAGS inside of the final sixteenth and kicked clear in the end. HOLY ZAGS settled off of the early pace while two wide on the first
turn, gained ground on the backstretch run, loomed three wide nearing the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and took a narrow lead into the final
furlong but could not hold off the winner in the final stages and was outfinished, while besting the rest. PERFECTLY JULIE was sent leaving the break,
opened to a clear lead on the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure along the second turn, stayed on into
upper stretch but could not match strides in the late stages and faltered in the drive while just holding for third. CITY GLITTER went three wide outside of
rivals on the first turn, advanced on the backstretch run, moved up to vie for the lead nearing the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in
the final stages. EXQUISITE LEGACY saved ground while forwardly placed early on, stalked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost position
on the second turn and weakened in the drive.

EVENEREVENWORSE was shuffled soon after the break while in tight, advanced while two wide nearing the quarter marker, took command into the drive
and pulled away in the end. SATANTA was off a bit slowly and settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the turn, tipped out at the head of the
lane, was no match for the winner in the end but closed to secure the place. COLORMEMONEY chased the early pace while in traffic to the turn, was
fanned four to six wide along the turn, was outkicked in upper stretch but was clear for third. DUMB LUCK was sent to the front leaving the break and
contested the quick early pace to the turn, bore out entering the turn and fanned out COLORMEMONEY, lost position in upper stretch and did not offer a
late response. SUNSET DRAGUNN tracked the early pace to the turn, bore out leaving the three furlong marker and did not mount a late rally. HONG
KONG COWBOY was sent in the early stages, set the fast contested pace to the turn, carved out quick fractions to the quarter marker, took a bad step
approaching the top of the stretch, lost the rider in upper stretch and was vanned off.

of the stretch, was put to firm urging through the lane while on the left lead, came within aim inside of the sixteenth-marker and made a late surge to prevail.
NAVY ARMED GUARD stalked the early pace from a two wide path, advanced along the backstretch run, came within aim on the second turn, edged to a
narrow lead in upper stretch, was all out in the final stages and was tagged in the final strides for the win, while just holding for second. DICEY MO CHARA
(GB) was three wide along the first turn while not far back, maintained position through the backstretch run, gained ground along the second turn, lacked
room approaching the quarter pole and into upper stretch, shifted in and vied for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was just edged out in the end
while holding for third. MASTER PIECE (CHI) settled off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced on the second turn to come within aim nearing the
quarter marker, continued that bid to vie for the lead nearing the eighth pole but could not match strides in the end and was edged for the show. AMERICAN

the late stages. LURE HIM IN settled in midpack while three wide early on, gained ground on the second turn while four then five wide and lacked a late
rally. TOM'S SURPRISE hesitated then bobbled leaving the start and was away slowly, trailed into the second turn, made up ground in the stretch but did
lacked the needed late response. GOVENOR'S PARTY settled in the early going, maintained a three wide trip to the second turn and did not offer a late
response. WAR GAMES was hustled leaving the start and was sent to the front, set the fast contested pace through the second turn, was caught in upper
stretch and tired in the late stages. JAMMING EDDY was sent leaving the break, pressed the fast early pace through the backstretch run, lost position
nearing the quarter marker and faded in the drive.

Footnotes
REFI NOW angled to the rail after the start, rated nicely in the chasing group, had to steady slightly on the turn when TIME IS GONE took his path, swung
three wide into the stretch overtaking the early leaders while under a hand ride and drew off as much the best when asked to go on. DIAMOND WILLOW
was hustled from the gate but was unable to make an impact on the pace, settled near the rear of the field in the early going, launched an extended bid at
the halfway marker,found an opening to the outside, and continued to rally, passing all but one. DRUMADOON broke quickly but veered out slightly,
bothering REFI NOW, was part of the early duel but backed off to a stalking position, was in tight through the turn, encountered traffic through the stretch
and was outfinished while securing third in the end. TIME IS GONE joined the speed duel early, was unable to keep up after a quarter, swung out six wide
into the drive and gave way in the end. PERSEVERANCE from an alert beginning was forced by circumstance to a wide trip and was never a threat.
PRINCE HUSSAR away best, was immediately hooked by FLOYD KNOWLES to his outside, put that one away entering the stretch, had the lead but tired
badly in the final furlong. PRINCE CINDERELLA was under a ride from the gate, had nothing to offer when asked to pick it up and finished one paced,
passing only one at the end. FLOYD KNOWLES showed good early speed and dueled outside of PRINCE HUSSAR through the first half, briefly made the
lead turning for home but then gave way readily. DOUBLE THE GOLD was slow out of the gate and always outrun.
