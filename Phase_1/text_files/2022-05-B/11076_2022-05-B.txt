THIS MASQUERADE was bumped at the start, stalked the pace early on, was on the inside into the lane, took over command and drew clear late in the
stretch. SMART BUCK raced in the six path along the first turn, tracked the early pace, made a bid nearing the lane but was no match for the winner in the
stretch run. WILMORE chased the pace early, fanned into the seven path entering the lane and moved up in the stretch drive. HOLD ME GIRL was never a
threat. ROSIE was through after a half. SHOULDAKNOWNBETTER set the pace for a three quarters then caved. THE MILE TIME WAS OMITTED DUE TO
THE BEAM BEING OBSTRUCTED.
