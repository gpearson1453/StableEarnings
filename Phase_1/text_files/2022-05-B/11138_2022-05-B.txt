Footnotes
UPTOWNEAGLESLANDED was in contention early, racing along the two path, then angled out at the eighth pole closing with a rush, and drawing off from
the field to win convincingly. COLEMAN CREEK made the lead, traveling along the rail, getting steady pressure from the outside, all the way around, but
was outfinished at the wire and held on to place. AFFRAY pressed the pace, from the two path all the way around, offered a bid, but could not get by.
WILTON was near the back early on, then angled out, three wide and offered a mild bid down the lane. I'M A COOL CAT had no early foot, going two wide
and offered a mild bid in the stretch drive. ROYAL CONSORT stalked the pace, three wide and faded in the stretch. HEZA FREAK showed no early speed,
then made a middle move, going into the turn, then dropped back in the stretch. JUST HANGIN RIDGE was mid field early, from the rail, and was through
early.

made the lead racing along the rail, then gave way in late stretch to hold on for place. STANS HOME RUN showed no early foot, racing far back, then
angled out in the stretch, closing willingly to get up for show. SUNDAY BLING was near the back, angled out, five wide in the stretch and rallied, just missing
third. WARRIORS HAVEN was mid pack racing along the inside and offered an even effort. MY GOLDEN M pressed the pace until late stretch and then
tired. AXEL STEEL chased the pace early on, racing along the rail and then faded in the stretch. MORO WOLF stalked the pace down the backstretch,
traveling three wide and dropped back in mid stretch.
