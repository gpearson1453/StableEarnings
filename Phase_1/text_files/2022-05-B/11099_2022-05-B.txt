Footnotes
T BONES TRICK, off slowly, was urged to gain a contending position switching out three wide racing through the first turn, advanced in that path to press
the issue on the far turn, then edged clear through the stretch under firm encouragement. UNITED PATRIOT, pulling a bit along the inside tracking just off
the leaders to the backstretch, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors. CANDY COVE,
urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow margin to the far turn, resisted the winner's bid racing into upper
stretch but proved no match in the last furlong. DYNAMIC RULER, urged prompting the pacesetter in the opening half, dueled for command between foes
on the far turn but came up empty in the drive. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT settled last to the backstretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
CHA was urged clear in the opening stages shifting well off the rail, held sway on a clear margin racing into upper stretch and responded to firm handling to
hold safe the challenge of MILLIGANMIKEANDME to the end. The latter tracked the pacesetter inside foes from just out of striking distance racing to the
turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued willingly along the rail to challenge inside the winner nearing the wire while always second best. SPEEDY
ENOUGH broke outwards bumping IMPULSUS, was taken in hand dropping off the pacesetter in the opening sixteenth, came under stout pressure shifting
out three wide to advance on the leaders racing into the bend, continued in the four path through the stretch and finished evenly to prevail for a share.
BRAHMS IS WHO tracked the leaders five wide on the backstretch, exchanged some light contact with IMPULSUS racing past the half mile marker, angled
inwards to the three path entering the stretch but had no closing bid. IMPULSUS, bumped soundly at the start, was righted to track the leaders four wide
between foes, exchanged light contact nearing the turn, angled to the inside racing into the stretch but had no late response. REESE C angled inwards
while being prompted in pursuit of the pacesetter racing to the turn but emptied out early.

Footnotes
SWANAGE broke readily, angled to the inside setting the pace on a narrow margin into the backstretch, kept on when challenged on the far turn, then
turned back a bid from STARS OF BLUEGRASS racing past midstretch to edge forward late under firm hand urging while the rider flashed a right handed
whip. The latter angled to the inside stalking just off the leaders racing into the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch splitting rivals to challenge for
command entering the lane but proved no match leaving midstretch. MAD GRACE switched out racing to the backstretch tracking off the first flight outside a
rival in the opening half, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned four wide into upper stretch but lacked the
needed final kick. BOLD REY, in touch with the pacesetter prompting that rival into the backstretch, was urged to press the issue entering the far turn, was
carried out three wide nearing upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. LADY PHYLLIS settled last while angling to the inside racing to the
backstretch, continued along the inside to the far turn but offered no rally.

upper stretch while being roused left handed and wrested the advantage in time. YESTERYEAR tracked the pacesetter three deep between foes in early
stages, angled inwards racing into the turn while moving to terms with the leader to press the issue into upper stretch, couldn't contain the winner but edged
a rival for the place honors. CLIMB AND MAINTAIN, urged to the lead from the break shifting off the rail, shifted to the inside entering the turn, dueled for
command inside rivals nearing upper stretch into the lane but weakened in late stages. HOLY MUCHACHO tracked the leaders between foes in the opening
quarter, lost some position avoiding close quarters nearing the three furlong marker, angled out four wide racing into the stretch and continued with an even
effort. SHATTERED DREAMS tracked the leaders four wide between foes as part of the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
SMART CALL, held up last in early stages, was prompted to gain contention racing five wide into the turn and had no closing bid. FRONT OFFICE angled
inwards early tracking the pacesetter between foes just off the inside in the opening quarter but soon faded entering the turn.

Footnotes
LATIN NIKKITA angled inwards while being rated off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch, continued in hand awaiting an opening while
shifting to the inside on the far turn, tipped out nearing midstretch to split foes and surged to the lead nearing the wire to prevail in a well timed rally. MO
CLARE'S, urged to dictate the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage to the backstretch, held sway into upper stretch but was collared at the wire.
DISTORTED VIEW tracked the pacesetter three deep in second flight for the opening five furlongs, shifted inwards nearing the lane to challenge that rival
but flattened out racing through the stretch while lasting for a share. B J'S SPIRIT angled to the inside early stalking just off the first flight, saved ground on
the far turn while being prompted to advance nearing the lane but had no closing bid. A BROKEN BREEZE, reserved last racing to the backstretch,
gathered momentum entering the far turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and gained some position late while making no real impression.
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY angled to the inside tracking off the second flight racing to the backstretch, switched out four wide leaving the midway point of the
far turn but lacked the needed late bid. SHABAM settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued three deep between foes into the stretch but had
no rally. HURRICAIN HUNTER, reserved while switching outside foes racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, was steadied avoiding tight
quarters nearing the midway point of the far turn, angled out five wide racing into the stretch but proved no threat. HOTASAPISTOL, forwardly placed
between foes prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, emptied out abruptly nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
PRINCESS LIVIA was urged to gain the inside rivals soon after the break, quickly sprinted away to a clear advantage racing off the rail to the turn, held
sway on a narrow margin to upper stretch, shifted out in the closing stages but maintained a safe advantage to the end under right handed pressure.
EMERALD PRINCESS broke readily, was urged along three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, continued with a steady effort just outside that rival
to late stages but couldn't gain even terms. BETTY'S BAR broke awkwardly, settled last racing to the turn, then split foes in the closing stages to prevail for
a share. OUR LITTLE TIGER, urged between foes pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way nearing upper stretch. MINGO MAGIC tracked off the
first flight four wide in early stages, shifted inwards entering the bend but steadily faded nearing upper stretch. SWEETNESS TO, off a step slowly, was
prompted to track just off the leaders along the inside in the opening quarter but soon retreated.

between foes in the last flight, angled inside on the turn, then angled five wide in upper stretch to find his best stride and close the gap on the winner late.
FAYETTE WARRIOR tracked off the first flight between foes racing into the bend, shifted out to race four wide between foes in the closing stages but
continued with interest to prevail for a share. GIANT GAMBLE, prominent four wide in the opening stages, angled inwards pressing the pace outside a rival
into the turn, dueled between foes to midstretch and faded in late stages. ROCKTIZWAY, shuffled out of tight quarters in the opening quarter, angled to the
inside tracking off the second flight racing into the turn, shifted out racing through the stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SMOOTH PAPA tracked off
the second flight outside rivals racing to the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch but proved empty in the drive. EPIC DRAMA, urged between foes, then
along the inside dueling for command into the turn, pressed the issue to upper stretch and gave out late. MR NAVIGATOR, urged to forward a placing along
the inside tracking just off the leaders, saved ground to upper stretch, awaited an opening nearing midstretch and came up empty in the final stages.
WESTERN SMOKE tracked off the second flight racing four wide to the turn and offered no rally. TIME HEIST settled outside foes racing in the last flight to
the turn and proved no threat. IMA SUNNY SONG settled in the last flight along the inside in the opening quarter and failed to menace thereafter.
