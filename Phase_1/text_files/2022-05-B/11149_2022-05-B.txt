Footnotes
SISTER LINDA was bumped hard at the start then hustled, showed speed on the inside of the runner-up then settled behind that runaway foe under
coaxing, rounded the turn in the three path while put to stronger encouragement, gained on the tiring pacesetter coming to the quarter-pole, took over in
upper stretch and drew off under a strong drive. ROYAL CURRENCY showed speed on the outside then went clear outside the three-quarter pole, sped off
through fast fractions and opened up a large gap, dropped from the two path to the rail around the turn, shortened stride coming to the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage to the winner in upper stretch and tired but was clear for the place. BERN ROSEY BERN broke in and bumped hard with a foe, settled towards
the rear, was urged along in the four path around the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and secured the show while racing greenly. SWEET MAEVE broke
in then was corrected by the rider, was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, paused when BERN ROSEY BERN
drifted in front inside the three-sixteenths and was no factor. SECRET HIDEOUT dropped back then settled at the rear on the outside, dropped back five
wide around the turn, moved to the three path outside the quarter-pole and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
GIACOSA two to three wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a
good finish to threaten outside inside the final furlong, knocked heads with CLASSIC LADY in the final sixteenth and just got the nod on the wire over a
determined rival. CLASSIC LADY showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch
when placed to coaxing, got roused nearing the eighth pole under threat from a pair, repelled the challenge of SHE'S THE ONE inside that station
confronted by the aforementioned foe and dug in stubbornly inside clinging to the lead until nailed in the very last stride to the wire in a good effort. SHE'S
THE ONE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge a furlong from home, got repelled inside that station and ran on clear for the show honors. SILKY
BLUE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and spun two to
three wide into upper stretch, offered no response. RUNAWAY RUMOUR two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, tipped out four
wide nearing the quarter pole and angled five wide into upper stretch, then made no headway. POP THE BUBBLY three to four wide in pursuit, came under
coaxing at the three-eighth, got floated five wide briefly by RUNAWAY RUMOUR nearing the quarter pole and angled in to swing three to four wide at the
head of the stretch and trailed.

AGGREGATION broke in at the start, established position just off the pace under coaxing, was urged along while two then three wide around the turn then
driven four wide into the stretch, chased the runner-up under a drive into the final furlong, gained the lead coming to the sixteenth-pole then moved clear
under a hand-ride to prove much the best. PINEAPPLE MAN bumped with a rival at the start, prompted the pace on the outside of the leader while loosely
between foes, was urged along in the two to three path around the turn, gained the lead at the quarter-pole, led under a drive to just before the
sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the place. FULL MOON FEVER bobbled at the start, was urged along off the pace, saved ground around
the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and improved to secure the show. MAJOR SPIN broke in then was hustled to the front, set the pace under
pressure to his outside, was asked along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage at the quarter-pole and tired. THRILL OF IT was hustled from the gate,
raced just off the pace, dropped back three then two wide around the turn and lacked the needed response. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES was last to
commence, settled at the rear under some urging, traveled around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten. MAJESTIC TIGER settled well back under
some urging, raced inside early on the turn then shifted three wide, angled six wide outside the quarter-pole and was no factor. G MUNNING broke out a bit
at the start, settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond. UMBRIA stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe,
stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back three then four wide around the turn and faltered.

FRONT LINE DANCER three then two wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch,
closed well outside to latch on and knock heads through the final sixteenth and just got the nod on the wire. NIKOSTRATOS coaxed from the start, settled
two to three wide near the rear of the field coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command a sixteenth out, dug in head to head and lost the bob on the line. BIONDI got bumped at the start by WHISTLER'S
HONOR, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand along the inside, cut the corner into upper stretch roused for the drive, dug in under threat from a trio,
relented near the sixteenth marker and ran on to preserve the show honors. URAGANO just off the pace three wide, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and kept on to the finish but was out-finished in the late stages. BERNARDINO
tracked the pace along the inside, cut the corner roused into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. LOOKIN GRAND
forwardly placed in the two path in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened in the late going. MEDIA SENSATION three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. WHISTLER'S HONOR broke in at the start bumping BIONDI, tracked along the inside from near the rear of the
field, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, came under brief light urging at the eighth pole, paused and then was briefly and lightly urged at the
sixteenth marker and made his way to the finish never extended. MR. CONNECTICUT just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, tipped out a path near the eighth pole and came up empty.

Footnotes
OUT OF SIGHT went to the front while taken in hand, strolled clear under tight restraint while the rest of the field was under strong holds, controlled the
action in the two path around the turn, responded well when set down into upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, was given one light
pop of a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a strong hand-ride to the wire. RHEAUME bumped with foes at the
start, was taken under a strong hold early then rated on the inside, swished her tail when let out with five furlongs to run, saved ground under urging around
the turn, moved off the rail into upper stretch, battled two opponents for the place and narrowly earned that position while no threat to the winner. I'M FINE
broke a half-step slow, was keen under stout restraint onto and early on the backstretch then reserved off the pace, went four wide while given her cue on
the turn, came five wide into the stretch, battled outside of two foes for the place and just missed that position while narrowly able to get the show. NEW
GINYA broke a step slow, was reserved under restraint, went two to three wide around the turn, was roused four wide at the quarter-pole, battled with two
foes for the place and show positions then just missed the trifecta. UNICORN SALLY bumped with foes at the start, was reserved towards the back, went
three then four wide on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. FREEDOM MACHINE bumped with a rival at the
start, was taken in hand early then reserved while saving ground, moved to the two path late on the turn, was asked for her best in upper stretch and failed
to rally. KANNON FIRE broke in and bumped lightly with a foe, was placed under a strong hold while close to the front early then taken back and rated on
the outside, went three wide on the turn, was roused inside the three-eighths and came up empty.

Footnotes
STERLING SILVER settled off the pace, was carried out outside the five-eighths then dropped in, came under urging in the three path around the turn,
rallied four wide into the stretch then took over around the three-sixteenths, shook clear outside the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging.
CAPTAINSDAUGHTER settled towards the back, was roused five wide on the turn, gained under a drive into upper stretch, chased the winner while
looming a threat into the final furlong but flattened out while drifting out and settled for the place. NOVEMBER REIN showed good speed, set the pace under
pressure to her outside, vied inside to the two path around the turn, lost the lead under a drive in upper stretch and weakened but held the show.
ADVERSITY pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. TRUE EMPRESS broke a half-step
slow, settled on the outside, was roused four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. KISSES FOR EMILY was off a
half-step slow then dropped back, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground around the turn and showed little. YO CUZ bobbled at the start then was
hustled before being taken in hand early, moved out while rated off the pace, reached the outside with five furlongs to run then tracked the pace, was asked
in the four path on the turn and faltered then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
ROTKNEE coaxed from the gate, spurted away in hand just off the inside, remained on hold until set down continuing just off the inside into upper stretch,
drew off under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in growing a bit leg weary and held safe to prevail. BEST IDEA coaxed from the gate, raced just off the inside
briefly before tipping out to chase four wide under coaxing from the get go, angled seven wide into upper stretch, closed well outside unable to reach the
winner while clear of the rest and along second best. AGILITY bumped with TIN PAN ALLEY after the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch
and then two to three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the
show honors. WHO HOO THATS ME brushed at the start by KAZMIKE, who broke out a step, chased four then three wide, made his way to the two path
when placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and offered no response. KAZMIKE broke out a step at the start brushing the
aforementioned foe, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and tired. TIN PAN
ALLEY bobbled after the start when making contact with AGILITY, chased two to three wide until tucked inside into the turn getting placed to coaxing half a
mile from home, made some mild progress midway on turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. REBEL EMPIRE chased along the inside
down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn briefly coaxed along at the seven-sixteenths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
OCALA DREAM saved ground around the opening bend, settled off the pace, moved out around the five-eighths pole, went three then four wide on the far
turn,ranged up to make a bid into the stretch then took the lead at the three-sixteenths, battled outside a foe into the final furlong, shook clear into the final
sixteenth and prevailed under steady handling. SANCTUARY CITY was bumped on both sides at the start then pinched back, dropped to the inside around
the first turn, settled at the rear, went three then four wide around the far turn, gained five wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place.
THERAPIST saved ground on the first turn, settled off the pace, went around the far turn in the two path, waited while blocked in upper stretch, altered
course and angled out outside the furlong marker, came between horses outside the sixteenth-pole and finished with good courage to just miss the place
while up for the show. CROSS BORDER bumped with a foe at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the
far turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while up for the last spot in the superfecta. SOMELIKEITHOTBROWN bumped a
foe with his hindquarters at the start, was taken under a strong hold in the five path around the opening bend, moved to the lead outside the five-eighths
then went clear, rounded the far turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought with that
foe into the final furlong and weakened. ADVANCED STRATEGY remained out in the four path around the first turn, dropped just off the pace, was asked
while three wide on the far turn and tired. CITY MAN showed in front early in the two path while in hand, lost the advantage outside the five-eighths then
was tugged back off the pace, saved ground around the far turn, steadied repeatedly while lacking room throughout the stretch and lost any chance. STEP

SILKEN DOLLAR established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths under pressure from QUEEN OF LIES to the outside, spun just off the inside for home, shook off that rival and edged clear under a drive to
the eighth pole, dug in under growing lone threat and just held on by a sliver to prevail on the line. SINFULLY SWEET just off the pace just off the inside in
pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, offered up a good kick to close in stoutly on the outside and just missed by a
nostril while clear of the rest for the place honors. ARD MACHA forwardly placed tracking the leader along the inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. BAVARIAN CREME just off the inside near the rear of the field, came
under coaxing nearing the quarter pole three to four wide, angled eight wide into upper stretch, kept on through to the finish. SMOKIN' HOT KITTY broke out
at the start and was corrected, chased two to three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung three then two wide into upper stretch and made no
headway. QUEEN OF LIES broke out at the start carrying out CROSSTALK into DREAM CENTRAL, raced four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to
the two path and advanced to prompt the pace midway on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch, got
shaken off nearing the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. DREAM CENTRAL got bumped at the start by CROSSTALK due to pressure from
QUEEN OF LIES, chased five then four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. LATEST
EDITION two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and weakened. OAK LOVES A FIGHT
broke in at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide for home and made no impact. SHE'S A NATURAL
dwelt at the start conceding eight to nine lengths to the front when leaving the gate, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three to four wide through the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CROSSTALK got carried out a path at the start by QUEEN OF
LIES and in turn bumped DREAM CENTRAL, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, went five wide into
upper stretch and tired. MO NIGHEAN DONN chased along the inside, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch and tired.
