Footnotes
SEASIDE DANCER tracked the quick early pace from the inside, angled out at the head of the stretch, was kept to task while advancing in midstretch,
overtook the dueling pacesetters leaving the sixteenth marker and drew clear late. SWANEE engaged with GALWALKSINTOABAR soon after the break and
disputed the quick early fractions with that rival, continued to duel on the front end into upper stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and was
passed late by the winner but stayed on to hold for place. CALIFORNIA COOL settled off of the early pace, saved ground through the turn, advanced in
upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive but was up in time to get the nod for third. GRAZEN HONOR chased the early pace, lost position on the turn while
two wide, did not mount a late bid in the stretch and was just edged for the show. GALWALKSINTOABAR was sent leaving the break and engaged with
SWANEE to contest the pace through the turn, edged to a narrow lead leaving the eighth pole, was tiring while on the left lead in the final stages and gave
way in the end. THIS IS THE ONE was a bit hard to load, lacked early speed to the turn, came two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the
drive, gained ground in the late stages but was not a threat.

Footnotes
AFFECTIONTO AUTISM stalked the early pace while three deep on the first turn, gained ground while three wide on the far turn, was roused into the drive,
confronted GALLANT OAK in upper stretch, was put to steady urging through the drive and responded in the end to draw clear. GALLANT OAK broke
alertly and was sent to the front, set contested solid fractions to the quarter marker, shook clear of WALKING BOSS in upper stretch, was confronted by the
winner nearing the furlong marker, met that bid but relented in the late stages and was outfinished while besting the rest. SALTO DE TIGRE was fractious in
the gate, settled just off of the early pace while saving ground, maintained that rail trip through the second turn, did not mount a final bid in the stretch but
kept on to secure third in the end. BROOKYS TAPIT was unprepared at the start and spotted the field early on, improved position on the backstretch run,
continued to advance on the second turn while two to three wide but could not sustain that bid in the stretch and lacked the needed late response.
WALKING BOSS was sent along the first turn to keep close attendance to the solid early fractions, prompted the pace to the second turn, could not keep up
in upper stretch and gave way in the drive. MAKE MINE WINE was fractious in the gate and was bumped at the start, settled three wide just off of the early
pace, lost position along the backstretch run, lost contact on the second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

QUANTUM QUEST broke sharply and sped to a clear early lead, set moderate fractions through the turn, felt mild pressure nearing the top of the stretch,
extended the lead in upper stretch, was kept to task through the lane and won in a drive in the end. BOBBY'S ALIBI chased the pace through the turn, was
able to gain a bit of ground nearing the quarter marker, could not match strides in upper stretch with QUANTUM QUEST and was held at bay through the
drive, while besting the rest. BROTHERLY LOVE hopped at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the moderate early pace to the turn, advanced while
three wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch but was clear for third. BARHOPSKY was a bit slow to begin, lacked early speed
while outside of rivals to the turn, shifted in along the turn to save ground into the drive and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
CHARLIE THE GENT was content to settle along the first turn, improved position on the backstretch run, was roused along the second turn and circled the
field to go four wide into the drive, came within aim leaving the furlong grounds and made a late surge to prevail in a blanket finish. FORGOTTEN VOWS
was sent leaving the break and tracked the early pace on the first turn, was given rein along the backstretch and disputed the pace into the far turn, took
command into the stretch run, had a clear lead into the final furlong, was confronted in the final stages by a host of oncoming rivals and was overtaken by
the winner but held for the place. DANNY MICHAEL raced in midpack in the early going while two wide, improved position along the backstretch run,
continued that advance into the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch but finished well along the rail in the final sixteenth and was up in time for third
while just missing for second. NORWESTER stalked the solid pace from a two wide path in the early going, gained ground on the second turn while three
wide, was outrun in upper stretch, re-rallied in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. WHISPER AND WINK was allowed to settle, gained
ground along the second turn, waited for room nearing the top of the stretch, angled out leaving the three-sixteenths marker and closed well late, just
missing for the minor awards. SUBITO SLEW settled along the inside, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid and flattened out
in the drive. AFRICAN PRINCE settled just off of the early pace while three wide on the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run, gained ground
while three wide nearing the quarter marker but lacked a late rally in the stretch. SIERRA SNOW STORM saved ground while unhurried in the early going,
lost contact along the second turn and was not a factor. PEQUENO AVELITO was a bit keen early on and went to the lead along the first turn, contested the
pace with FORGOTTEN VOWS through the backstretch run, gave way along the second turn and faded in the stretch.

Footnotes
LAGATHA broke in at the start, was sent to the front and set quick early fractions while on a clear lead, extended the lead in upper stretch, was kept to task
in the end and won in a drive. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, made up ground on the turn while along the rail,
maintained that rail trip through the stretch run and was unable to reel in the winner but finished well to be best of the rest. DAMN THE TORPEDOES
chased the pace outside of rivals, advanced along the turn, was outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late rally but held for third in the end. MY LEGAL BET
broke out at the start, chased the pace to the turn, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in upper stretch and weakened in the late
going. GOING TO SHABOOMS tracked the quick early fractions to the turn, stayed within aim of LAGATHA nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in
upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

the second turn while two then three wide, quickened in upper stretch, took a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, was confronted in the late stages by the
winner and could not hold him off in the end and was best of the rest. STAY LIT was unhurried in the early stages, was content to trail through the

end by the top two but was up for third. MESA EMPIRE was sent leaving the break, kept close attendance to the pace through the backstretch run,
advanced on the second turn to come to even terms with the pacesetter, overtook LYING GHOST leaving the quarter marker and edged to a clear lead in

WEAR THE CROWN was four wide while just off of the pace on the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run, vied for the lead leaving the three furlong
marker, took command into the drive, extended the lead through the stretch and held sway through the final stages. CANDYBOX broke alertly and was sent
to the front, was engaged by MEDAL ICE on the backstretch run and dueled with that foe to the second turn, was headed by WEAR THE CROWN leaving
the three furlong marker, relinquished the lead nearing the quarter marker, tipped out at the head of the stretch and stayed on well through the drive but was
outfinished in the end by the winner, while holding for second. THE LONNA RANGER was off a bit slowly, settled off of the early pace while saving ground,
maintained position into the second turn, was roused two wide into the drive, made a steady advance on the top pair in the lane and was clear for third in the
end. MEDAL ICE was bumped and shuffled back at the start, recovered to be in midpack while three wide on the first turn, was eager to go on on the
backstretch run and pulled to sit just off of the pace nearing the half-mile marker, came two wide between foes nearing the quarter marker while vying for the
lead, lost ground in upper stretch and did not offer a late rally in the drive. THE CALABRESE KID was unhurried in the early stages, improved position on
the second turn, was not able to threaten in the stretch run but did offer a mild late rally. FANTASTIC DREAM was allowed to settle in the early going,
improved position on the second turn while three wide, could not go on with that run and lacked the needed response in the stretch run. TRIBUTE TO
AFLEET stalked the pace on the first turn while three wide, lost position on the backstretch run, was outrun on the second turn and weakened in the final
stages. DEMON SIMMONS was forwardly placed in the early stages, lost position on the backstretch run, dropped back along the second turn, was eased
through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
ST ANTHONY settled off of the early place while saving ground, maintained position through the backstretch run, was steered to go two wide nearing the
quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch, angled out nearing the sixteenth-marker and surged through the final stages to prevail. HIGHLAND GHOST
broke alertly and was sent to the front, was engaged by WILL IS CHILL on the first turn and was prompted by that rival through the backstretch run while
carving solid fractions, shook clear along the second turn and extended the lead into midstretch, felt pressure nearing the sixteenth-marker, dug in late and
was tagged in the final strides by the winner, while holding for the place. CHIEF WILD EAGLE was unhurried in the early running while saving ground, was
content to trail through the backstretch run, was roused while five wide nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the drive, closed fast through the final
sixteenth and just missed for second while securing third in the end. BOISE was allowed to settle in the early going, was three wide along the first turn,
made a quick move to come within aim while four wide on the second turn, ran evenly to midstretch and was outclosed in the final stages.
MEETMEATTHECLUB settled off of the early pace while saving ground, maintained that rail trip into the second turn, advanced nearing the quarter marker
and into upper stretch and was outfinished in the drive. TRIP TO SPAIN was up close early on while contesting the early pace, took back to take a stalking
trip through the backstretch run, gained ground while three wide on the second turn, advanced in upper stretch but did not offer a final late bid. WILL IS
CHILL was hustled leaving the break and kept close attendance to solid pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn, was shuffled
back entering the stretch drive and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
DANGEROUS ILLUSION broke in at the start, was allowed to settle mid-pack outside and clear of the field, launched her bid approaching the quarter pole,
remaining widest of all, finishing strongly under a drive while racing on the wrong lead. ENGEE OMBEE hustled to the front, settled for a tracking position
behind the leader, was sent to challenge the leader at the halfway marker, briefly took the lead with a furlong to go, was outfinished for the win in a good
effort. MAGICAL LADY outrun early, moved to the rail, steadily gained ground on the leaders into the turn, looked for a clear path exiting the turn, advanced
in upper stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE away well, drifted in a little shortly after the start, bothering LUDIA, set the
early pace, had a mild response when challenged but gave way in the final furlong. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY was out of the gate in good order, was brushed
by LUDIA early, settled mid-pack to the turn, dropped back to the rear passing the half, then found renewed interest in the stretch finishing with good
energy. COUSIN NIECEY hit the gate at the start, remained in the middle of the track while devoid of early speed, started a run passing the half mile pole
and finished evenly. LUDIA off a step slow, recovered quickly only to be sandwiched between SHE'S ALL ATTITUDE and SHAMAN'S PRODIGY entering
the main course, found herself in a good striking position along the rail only to come up empty when asked. LEFT EYE broke inward and made contact with
ENGEE OMBEE who broke outward, then steadied and gave the rest of the field a five length head start, made a mild effort to gain contact with the rest of
the field but never made an impact.
