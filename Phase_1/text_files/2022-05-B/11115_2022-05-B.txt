Footnotes
MORO CODE was in the middle of the field racing down the backstretch, going two wide, then angled in on the turn, saving ground, and closed, driving up
the rail for the win. VICTOR VALENTINO was in contention early on, tracking the leader from the outside, then rallied down the lane to get up for place.
WITT AMERICA pressed the pace, racing two wide, made a bid in the turn but hung in late stretch. GOD'S GOLD was racing in the middle of the pack,
going four wide and only offered an even effort down the lane. RICHARD'S TX BLING made the lead, then the rider lost his whip at the eighth pole and he
proceeded to drop back from there. LINC'S BOY was near the back, running along the rail and showed little. LECTERN trailed the field throughout, going
two wide and was no factor.

OPTIMISTIC COWGIRL stepped away from the gates a bit slow and was allowed to settle down the backstretch, then angled out, four wide going into the
far turn and closed well, to win easily. AIRLINE DRIVE chased the pace, early on, racing three wide, then rallied at the head of the stretch to get up for place
and was second best on this day. HONOR GIVEN was mid field early on, then settled in, racing toward the back down the backstretch and made a bid down
the lane, three wide to get up for show. KAUSE I'M DEVINE made the lead, racing along the rail, then gave way at the head of the stretch. MISS B stalked
the pace, two wide, offered a mild bid on the far turn and flattened out in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD Z was sent to the early lead on the first turn to set the pace down the backstretch, drew off on the far turn and held on well for the win. BLURT
angled in sharply then chased the leader while in the two path, was in a steady drive into the far turn then continued to run evenly throughout the final
furlongs. RYE RUNNER was unhurried early, then raced while three wide to bid on the far turn but was no threat. MIDNIGHT HUNTER steadied early then
chased the leader from the inside, was in a long drive then flattened out entering the stretch and was no factor. PAYNTED LOVER raced four wide on the
first turn then trailed behind the field and eased across the finish line.

second. GOLDEN SECRET raced near the front, traveling four wide, then rallied down the lane to get up for show. MY BABYS GONE was mid pack, going
four wide and offered a mild bid down the lane. HEAD OVER BOOTS was mid field, going two wide and never fired. HAWKEYE GIRL pressed the pace,
early on, going two wide and faded in the turn. LITESTER was mid field, traveling in the three path and failed to respond. FACESTER was near the back,

COURTNEY FAY was allowed to settle down the backstretch, then angled out going into the far turn, circling the field and closed fast, five wide, to win
convincingly. COME CORRECT raced near the back early on, then rallied, three wide from between horses to get up for place, but was second best today.
JOY IN THE BATTLE pressed the pace early, traveling two wide, then dueled for the lead through the turn and gave way in the stretch, holding on for show.
KIMBELL'S STRATEGY raced mid pack, early, then made a bid in the turn, closing going three wide, but too late. APPRECIABLE made the lead, racing
along the inside, dueled into the far urn and but was overtaken and flattened out in the stretch. NORMALENORA showed no early speed, traveling four wide
and failed to respond. ONE RACY LADY was always near the back, four wide and never fired. SAGANAKI was near the front early, racing along the rail and

Footnotes
MR. NIGHTBLINGER chased the paced down the backstretch, becoming the leader of the second flight, from eight lengths back, then started closing the
gap, racing three wide and drawing off from the field to win easily. RUNNIN THE RED chased the pace from the inside, in the second flight from a distance,
then closed up the rail to get up for place and was second best. ASTA LAVISTA HONEY set the early pace, from the inside, dueling for the lead, down the
backstretch and through the turn, then faltered in late stretch and held on for show. KING ARTHUR RIDGE was mid pack, racing three wide and offered a
mild bid in late stretch. GET WITT GONE pressed the pace, going two wide, then dueled for the lead from from the backstretch and gave way down the
lane. CAMADABODY dwelt at the start, racing along the rail and showed little. REGAL PRIZE was mid field early and was through after a half.
