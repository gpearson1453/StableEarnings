Footnotes
OWEN'S SOUPER MOON stalked the pace, shifted out near the quarter pole, made a good five to six wide bid in the stretch run and finished well to draw
clear under strong handling. SPIRAL STORM settled off the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn, made a good rail bid in the drive and got
up for the place position. CORE pressed the early leader down the backstretch, raced two to three wide in the lane and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
FLEX showed good early speed from the inside and weakened a bit in the drive. THE BAND COMING settled off the early going, raced four wide through
the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive. COUSIN ROB stalked the pace from the inside, raced along the inside near the quarter pole, angled out
four wide in the stretch run and had no late response. DOC FISHMAN was allowed to settle off the early pace, took up sharply near the quarter pole, raced
four wide near the three sixteenths pole, angled out late and had no final bid. Doc Fishman claimed objection for interference against Owen's Souper Moor
at the quarter pole and stewards ruled no change. INTREPID WARRIOR was slow early, raced towards the inside and had no response.

BACHELOR PAD settled early on the backside, steadied from the 3/8's pole to the 5/16's pole, then found an opening down the lane and just got up.
HALLIE'S HERO settled in the early stages, angled out to three path midway on the turn, and was gaining but lost the photo. BAY OF RUM broke alertly
and chased the pace, leaving the turn had nothing left for the drive. OUR ZUMA was unhurried in the early stages, was two wide on the turn and finished
strongly while passing tiring foes. JACK BEANSTALK stalked in the early stages, was asked to keep up while three wide on the turn and had nothing left for
the finish. GASCONADE was unhurried following the break, saved ground on the turn, was asked for the drive and stalled. TORPEDO MAX hopped at the
start, quickly took the lead on the backside, was headed at the 1/4 pole and retreated. STEWARDS INQUIRY REGARDING STRETCH RUN BETWEEN

Footnotes
OCTOBER FROST settled off the early pace, moved up through the far turn, waited briefly near the quarter pole, angled near the rail, split foes while racing
two wide near the eighth pole and finished gamely to get up under strong handling. JMR PURE SENSATION settled to the middle of the pack early on,
raced four wide through the upper stretch and closed in gamely late. MUROMEC stalked the pace, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole, took
command nearing the eighth, led at the sixteenth pole and finished willingly to the wire. BELENTIME was unhurried early, raced four wide through the far
turn and moved up. FREE SHIPPING was forwardly placed to lay up close, raced two to three wide in the drive and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
INNUENDO settled off the early pace, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. GRAND GIZMO was sent along to set
the early pace and gave way while racing near the inside. WHY NOT BOURBON stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no late
response. QUIET REBEL broke awkwardly, lost a considerable amount of ground at the start, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never was
a factor.

Footnotes
SUPER LUNAR stalked the leader in the early stages and took command entering the stretch then drew away. WAR EMPRESS brushed the gate on the
break, was allowed to settle on the backside then made a four wide move on the turn and finished strongly. PIPESTONE took the lead soon after the break,
was the pacesetter till the early stretch and gamely chased winner home. AWILDAS TREASURE rated just off the leaders on the backside then angled out
when entering the quarter pole and had nothing left for the finish. BOSSALINA allowed to settle early while saving ground, made a mild bid on the turn into
mid stretch and had nothing left. SNOW SQUALL saved ground in the early part of race then angled out for the stretch run, offered no finishing kick. PURE
ELEGANCE settled early near the back of the field and never reached contention. TEXT ME UP chased the pace and emptied out.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC HORIZON was off just a step slow, rated down in the early stages, raced four wide through the upper lane finished strongly to be well clear late
under steady pressure. DAISY DANGLES pressed the early pace, raced along the inside in the drive and was no match for the winner. MOON POOL was
coaxed along while racing three wide early and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. BODY OF LAW stalked the pace, raced four wide through the
far turn and had no final winning bid. BLACK TAFFY showed good early speed from the inside and weakened. TARACOCO was off slowly, raced towards
the back early, angled out widest through the lane and never threatened. DREAMS AND SCHEMES failed to respond.
