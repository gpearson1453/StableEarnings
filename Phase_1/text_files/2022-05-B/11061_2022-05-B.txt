BRING ME A CHECK led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground around the turn, dueled the length of the stretch,
drifted out significantly in the final furlong, carrying BLAME J D with him, and held a short margin to the wire. BLAME J D angled in in the early going, cutting
off R MERCEDES BOY in the process, chased the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole,
dueled down the lane while being forced out by BRING ME A CHECK, and just missed. R MERCEDES BOY was cut off in the first few strides, stumbling
badly, trailed the field up what remained of the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the two and three path around the turn and continued
to gain ground mildly from there. EUROMANTIC tracked the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and
flattened out in the stretch. BAYOU GEM pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and tired in the lane.
THE RIDER OF HORSE FIVE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF HORSE 1, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE RIDER OF
HORSE 4 CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF HORSE 5 CITING INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE START OF THE RACE. STEWARDS
INQUIRIES WERE MADE INTO BOTH INCIDENTS. UPON REVIEW, HORSE 5 WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED BEHIND HORSE 4 FOR
INTERFERENCE JUST AFTER THE START. HORSE 1 WAS THEN DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED BEHIND HORSE 5 FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE
STRETCH.

Footnotes
JUSTICE WARRIOR led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn, kicked clear
entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire. SIMPSON BAY dueled from the two path around the first turn, dropped back to chase the leader up the
backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path approaching the three eighths pole, couldn't go with the eventual winner in the stretch and chased
that rival home, holding second. PORTSMOUTH saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn and finished evenly. SEEKING SPLENDOR hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field while saving ground around the first turn,
raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
gained ground on the outside late. SWAMPDRAINER raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run
up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and was outkicked from there. BIG PETE raced off the pace in
the two path through the opening half mile, moved up slightly while racing in the two path around the far turn and faded in the stretch. GRUNDER raced at
the back of the pack around the first turn and up the backstretch, improved position while saving ground around the far turn and flattened out in the lane.
FINALIZE raced between horses in the two and three path around the first turn, dropped back to trail the field up the backstretch, continued to lose ground
while racing inside around the far turn and was not a factor. SILLY BILLY raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the pace setters on the outside
up the backstretch, dropped back headed into the far turn, ran out to the six path and was empty from there.

LADY GOLDSTART stalked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kicked clear entering the stretch. SOMEONE
SAID SO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and gained ground late. HARKING hopped up leaving the gate,
trailed the field on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late on the rail to the wire. IN
THE RED raced in the middle of the pace on the outside early, began a bid from the three path racing around the turn, and was outkicked in the stretch
while drifting out midly. TEQUILA MARY tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, raced three wide around the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. LUVIN BULLIES raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, swung
wide entering the stretch and was never a threat. MY CRAFTY GAL chased the leader between horses in the early going, raced in the two path around the
turn and tired in the stretch. FIVE PICS PLEASE was away from the gate quickly, opened up an early lead up the backstretch, continued to show the way
while saving ground around the turn, bolted sharply to the outside passing the five sixeenths pole, losing his rider in the process and later walked off.

backstretch and around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. MY DOMINATOR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening
quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and gained ground outside late. JUST ASK JOEL trailed the field on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. RUXIN raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening
stages, began to improve position while saving ground around the turn and flattened out in the lane. LEO DEL REO chased the leaders on the inside up the
