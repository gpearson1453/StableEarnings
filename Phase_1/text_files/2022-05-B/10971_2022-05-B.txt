SEA LANE never far back to the turn, rallied into the stretch, roused to edge off in the late going under good handling. BE MY DOCTOR never far back to
turn, took over into the stretch but outfinished in the final furlong. LEMON GO bobbled a bit from the gate with no speed to stretch and only moved up late
for show spot. LITTLE RED SCOOTER inside speed to the turn, gave way readily rom that point. ROCKA BARRY had a compromised start with head
turned from the gate, raced far back to the turn and rallied to improve position in a gallant effort. MAHAL KITA close up early on outside, gave way readily
from the turn. HIDDEN HOOK brief speed, stopped badly from the turn and stretch run.
