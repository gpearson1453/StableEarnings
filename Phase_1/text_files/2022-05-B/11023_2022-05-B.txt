Footnotes
SHE'S SO NICE (IRE) broke out, vied for the lead from outside then cleared and crossed over early, set all the pace from the rail to the stretch and
remained clear under right-handed urging. HAVANA LOVE (IRE) showed early speed then ceded the lead to SHE'S SO NICE (IRE), closest in pursuit two
wide around the turn, moved out to the three path in the lane and regained the place. BIG SWEEP chased the leader along the rail to the stretch, lacked the
needed late punch and got edged for the place. XMAS SURPRISE stalked in the two path around the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and finished evenly
in the final furlong. UNBRIDLED MARY broke slow, moved out widest early then went three wide around the turn, continued widest in the stretch and never
responded to urging. THAT'S AMARE broke a bit slow from inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TAHOMA vied for command four deep early, lost a bit of ground into the turn but remained close up, re-engaged approaching the quarter pole, battled four
deep into the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch and held safely in the end. SALTA up close early five deep, chased the top quarter five wide through the
turn, finished willingly but could not threaten the winner late. EAGLES LANDING hesitated and came away very slow in the beginning, trailed five then four
wide around the turn, steered out wide in upper stretch and put in a late rally to earn the show honors. CROWNING GOLD vied between rivals into the
around the bend, fought back into the lane, had the rider lose his whip in upper stretch, flattened in the late stages and lost the show. STAY IN THE GAME
was off slow to begin, raced off the rail into the turn then angled to the inside, came back out in the drive and improved position. FORDY G vied from along
the rail to the stretch and weakened in the lane. FLAME RIDER contested the pace three deep to the stretch and also weakened. MENDEZ MILE away
quickly in the beginning then dropped back a bit to chase the early speed battle, exited the turn two to three wide and weakened.

strong handling. INVINCIBELLA (GB) broke well then took a stalking position on the inside, urged midway around the turn, closest in pursuit in the stretch
but was no match for the winner. PAID INFORMANT raced up close outside the pacesetter into the turn, lost ground under coaxing leaving the bend and

KELANI KIM set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared while along the rail with a quarter mile left to run and held well in deep stretch. HERE
COMES RALPHIE pressed the pace from outside to the far turn, chased the leader past the quarter pole two wide into the stretch, kept to task in the final
furlong and was gaining on the winner in deep stretch but was too late. WILD ARCH tucked inside on the first turn, moved off the rail on the backstretch,
asked three wide on the far turn, chased in range through the lane but lacked. STARSHIP SKY stalked off the inside, went three wide into the lane and
lacked a rally. SUE ETTAS GHOST settled on the inside then exited the far turn two wide, fought the rider in upper stretch and could not rally. MO
CONNELLY was off slow to begin, went two wide around the first, five then four wide on the second bend and came up empty.

Footnotes
MISS O'BRIEN vied for the lead six deep then three deep at the half-mile pole, dueled with IT'S GREEK TO ME leaving the backstretch, put away that rival
midway around the bend, widened to the sixteenth pole and held safely in the closing moments. BUSKER ALLIE stumbled leaving the gate, lagged behind
early then moved closer up the backstretch, swung five wide leaving the turn, closed fast but could not reach the winner. BAKER KAIT stumbled slightly
leaving the gate but quickly recovered and showed early speed, brushed and got crowded between rivals and moved back to a stalked position, chased two
wide into the lane and finished evenly in the final furlong. SUMMER LAKE bobbled leaving the gate, got put in tight and checked early, traveled along the
inside then angled out in the lane, lacked room in traffic behind a pair of rivals late and kept on for a minor award. IT'S GREEK TO ME vied between early
then dueled from inside leaving the backstretch, lost touch with the winner nearing the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the lane.
STRAWBERRYONTOP raced up close on the inside, had to pause when IT'S GREEK TO ME crossed over, continued along the rail and had no where to
go when boxed in on the turn, tipped out in the drive and could not rally. DIALING SCOTTY sat off the pace off the rail, went between rivals two wide on the
turn and also lacked a rally. CLASSIC CALIFORNIA broke a bit slow, tracked three wide into the turn, lost ground around the bend and got forced wide into
the stretch and tired. GALARINA raced up close three deep, got brushed by outside rival and crowded a bit early, stalked between leaving the backstretch,
lacked room at the three-eighths pole, angled out and came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. KEEPURSELF ALIVE contested the pace
early five deep then between foes near the half-mile pole, chased the top pair into the turn, exited the bend three wide and faded.

Footnotes
SHE'S A JOKER stalked along the fence, slipped through inside the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, cleared into the stretch and drew away. TRUE
PATRIOT was off slow to begin, tracked three deep on the backstretch, remained three wide into the stretch, finished well through the drive but had to settle
for second best. SMILING MOLLY set the pace and crossed over to the inside, drifted out four to five wide on the turn and saved the show. TRULY A MESS
veered in leaving the gate, bobbled crossing over the dirt, chased between then two wide into the stretch and lacked a bid. MARGOT'S GIRL got bumped a
few times and lost her path at the start, chased along the inside through the turn and never responded when called upon. DANCING SOUL chased the lone
leader outside a rival into the turn, got floated out five to six wide on the turn and weakened in the stretch. ACT OF SERENDIPITY bumped with inner rival
then lost her path at the start, trailed on the inside into the turn, moved off the rail around the bend and was never a factor. MAGIC GAME was off slow from
outside, tracked three deep, swung six wide into the lane and faded. CALI PRINCESS was off slow to begin, steadied when lacked room crossing back over
on to the turf, saved ground near the back through the turn and failed to menace.
