TIMELY TRADITION was well rated and was on the inside on the turn, eased out two wide nearing the quarter pole, angled out leaving the turn for racing
room, then closed well and went on even terms for command by the sixteenth pole, and then drew clear in the final hundred yards to prove best under a
drive. CUTEFACECHUBYWAIST prompted the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over leaving the quarter pole, then shook
clear by the furlong marker and then was headed nearing the sixteenth pole, could not go with the winner, second best. TANYA'S GEM was allowed to
settle early, advanced three wide on the turn and angled out to the outside and had a late rally, got show award. LADY MUNNINGS stalked the early pace
and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole, then faded in the drive, lost show award late. HIPNOTIZADA rushed up the inside to set the pace from the
inside and weakened in the drive.

GOLDEN LAW was fractious at the gate, was taken back and allowed to settle early, eased out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole, shifted to
the outside and closed full of run and drew clear late to prove best under left handed crop urging. ON ISLAND TIME prompted the pace and made a two
wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, shook clear leaving the furlong marker but was collared leaving the sixteenth pole and stayed
on to be clearly second best. BOUND BY TRUTH set the pace on the inside and then dueled for command from the quarter pole to the furlong marker and
then faded. JUSTKISSMYGRITS was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the start, stalked the pace three wide and weakened.
