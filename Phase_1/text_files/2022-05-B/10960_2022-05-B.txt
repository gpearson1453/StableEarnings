Footnotes
VILLAGE WAY stalked the pace from three wide, started to rally in mid turn, and closed willingly to get up for the win in his first race. STRAIGHT LUCK
dueled for the lead through the turn, got hooked again in late stretch and gave way grudgingly at the wire. HARD GOLD chased the pace, going tow wide,
made a late bid in the stretch and got up for show. BACKSIDE BUZZ dueled for the lead through the turn, and was tired down the lane for the stretch drive.
HE SAID WAIT was near the back, traveling five wide and passed a tiring rival. WELDON G was mid pack, three wide and failed to respond down the lane.
JIM NED got off slow from the gate, going three wide and showed little.

BLUE BOON made the lead out of the gate, drew clear of the field down the backstretch, and never looked back, for an easy win on the front end.
BRENTLEY (GB) chased the pace along the inside, then angled out at the quarter pole, to rally and get up for second. CLIFF DIVER got shuffled back at
the start, then saved ground, racing along the inside, and closed up the rail to grab third. OPTIMAL TRIP was allowed to settle early, then made a bid on the
turn, but faltered late. COTTONWOOD had no early foot, going two wide, and had a mild bid in late stretch. BRUCELEA pressed the pace, going four wide,
and failed to fire in the stretch drive. HARD CANDY was mid field, three wide and had an even effort. SHARP DOUBLE EDGE was near the back, traveling
four wide and failed to menace. CLEAR ADVANTAGE was in contention early, three wide and faded in the turn. LINC'S BOY stalked the pace, going four
wide and dropped back at the three eighths pole.

Footnotes
SKY HIGH SUSAN was allowed to settle early on, then made a move, circling the field, going five wide and closed with a rush, to easily overtake the field for
the win. AUNT GEM stalked the pace, along the inside, then rallied up the rail, slightly ducking in at the gap, to be second best. COLORS OF THE WIND
dueled for the lead throughout the race, traveling along the inside and gave way grudgingly in late stretch. TEXAS BLUEBONNET was near the back, going
four wide and offered a mild bid down the lane. SHE'S A BOSSY GIRL chased the pace, two wide, made a mild bid and hung late. ROLLIN CHROME
dueled for the lead, all the way through the turn, traveling two wide and faded in the stretch drive. BEER EMPRESS was mid pack, along the rail and never
fired. MIZ JAMESON was near the front, three wide and dropped back at the quarter pole. SHE HIT A HOMER was mid field, three wide and was no factor.
