Footnotes
MONEY IN THE BANK chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
steadily gaining to get up in the final jumps to the wire and prevail. MEXICAN WONDER BOY broke in at the start taking over the lane of MR. PETE and
forcing that rival to steady, then crossed to show the way in hand just off the inside, remained patiently handled safely in front, took the inside route into
upper stretch set down for the drive, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and was caught in the final strides to the finish.
MONTAUK DADDY chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. MR. PETE
got forced to steady at the start when his lane was taken over by the breaking inwards MEXICAN WINDER BOY and was forced to concede three to four
lengths to the front, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, continued three wide into upper stretch and offered
no response. NEXT FLIGHT chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and weakened. KAREN'S COVE
chased three wide until tucked inside at the nine-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and trailed.

Footnotes
CLASSIC COLORS dropped to the rear, went around the opening bend in the two path, was reserved at the back of the tightly bunched field, went two then
three wide around the far turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied on the outside, closed fast to make a bid just inside the furlong marker then
moved in closer to the runner-up, fought outside of that foe to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. INSTINCTIVE went four then three wide around
the first turn, was rated under a hold on the outside, stalked three wide on the far turn, was given her cue outside the five-sixteenths, rallied into upper
stretch, closed well to make a bid between foes just inside the furlong marker, battled inside of the winner to the wire and missed but earned the place.
MARVELOUS MAUDE was taken under a hold early then rated in the two path, came under urging late on the far turn, chased under a drive into the final
furlong, moved out around the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. PURE BODE went to the front, dropped from the two
path to the rail around the first turn, showed the way in hand, vied inside on the far turn, was asked under threat approaching the quarter-pole, shook off a
foe in upper stretch, led under a drive into the final furlong but was overtaken and missed the trifecta. WAR CANOE went three then two wide around the
opening turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was let out in the two path on the far turn, turned into the stretch on even terms for the lead, dropped back
outside the furlong marker and tired. CARA'S DREAMER was taken under a strong hold then rated just off the pace on the inside while tugging keenly at the
bit, came under encouragement late on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.

Footnotes
MASEN (GB) three wide in close aim of the leader advanced nearing the five-sixteenths to take over command just inside that station, swung two to three
wide into upper stretch, got roused straightened away under a light brief drive and quickly drew clear, then got geared down to the finish with the outcome in
no doubt. DUKE OF HAZZARD (FR) tracked two to three wide patiently handled until set down near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one while running on to chase that rival home well clear of the remaining foe and geared down through most of the final furlong.
WOLFIE'S DYNAGHOST lightly coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside through moderate splits, came under coaxing near the
five-sixteenths as MASEN advanced outside, got displaced from the front just inside that station and cut the corner into upper stretch getting left behind,
then was not persevered with while backing away to the finish.

Footnotes
JOHNSELECTRICRIDE broke alertly then was hustled, chased the pace while saving ground, came under the crop inside the five-sixteenths, moved out
outside the furlong marker, gained to take the advantage inside that marker, disposed of the runner-up under a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole
then was placed under a hand-ride while widening to the wire. LIMIT UP was hustled to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, went around the
turn in the two path, was asked near the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, led into the final furlong then was overtaken by the winner
and proved no match but held the place. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased the
leader under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but earned the show. PERFECT BANKER stumbled badly at the start then bumped with a foe,
bumped with another rival shortly thereafter, was rated on the outside, went four wide while asked on the turn and came up empty. DISENGAGE broke a
half-step slow, was urged along off the pace, saved ground through the turn and had nothing left. DATESFREEDOM broke a half-step behind the top three
then was bumped in the hindquarters after the start, settled off the pace, was roused two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond. HOW YOU
FEELING bumped with an opponent at the start and was last to commence, dropped well behind under urging, rounded the turn in the two path and was no
factor.

Footnotes
SUMMER AT THE SPA tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, tipped out with
about three-sixteenths to go in front of the backing away CELINE THE QUEEN and rallied with dead aim on the leader to quickly collar that rival inside the
eighth pole, then edged clear to the finish to score. TIS A PITY four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch in pursuit from mid pack, tucked three
then two wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch and paused briefly as
THEGODDESSOFSNAKES and IDAKA were directly in front, tipped out a path following APPRECIATE re-engaged by the rider and kicked on belatedly to
secure the place honors. APPRECIATE four wide in pursuit from mid pack, remained patiently handled through the turn until set down angled five wide into
upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick to be along for the show honors in a good effort. OFALLTHEGINJOINTS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in
hand just off the inside under some pressure from CELINE THE QUEEN to the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and shook off that rival
taking the inside route into upper stretch, edged away under a drive straightened away, dug in under lone threat and was caught nearing the sixteenth
marker, then weakened in the very late stages. MORE MANGO three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper
stretch and offered up a mild bid. IDAKA coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. FROSTED BOURBON chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and
offered no response. THEGODDESSOFSNAKES chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled three wide into upper stretch and
weakened in the drive. QUEENTIGUA chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under urging with five-sixteenths to go, took the
inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. CELINE THE QUEEN coaxed from the start, prompted the pace along the inside coming under coaxing
near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in the midst of being shaken off by the leader and tired to the finish. PROPER GRAMMAR
fractious in the gate prior to the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, continued inside into upper stretch and made no
impact. EVIDENCE BASED got away to a hesitant start, chased just off the inside detached at the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn, angled five
wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LOLA FLO went straight to the front, fought the restraint of the rider while rated rank on the lead, extended the advantage with a half-mile to run, controlled
the action a bit off the rail around the turn, responded well when set down in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker and proved
much the best under a strong hand-ride in the final sixteenth. VINTAGE GIRL settled at the rear of the field, was urged along in the two path around the
turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and narrowly earned the place while no threat to the winner. CLARA BELLE dropped back then settled off the
pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, shifted into the two path entering the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and just missed the place while
clear for the show. MISS INVINCIBLE was rated on the outside, went four then five wide under urging on the turn and came up empty. WATERS OF
MEROM stalked the pace on the outside of the leader under a tight hold, dropped back some near the half-mile pole, was asked in the three path on the
turn and capitulated. GRIS TORMENTA backed off the pace turning down the backstretch then was rated outside while tracking, came under urging while
three then four wide on the turn and had nothing left.

Footnotes
HONEY MONEY coaxed from the gate, raced four then three wide in closest aim of the leader advancing to take over command when put to coaxing
nearing the quarter pole, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive kept to task. JOIN THE DOTS broke in a step at the start
brushing COURAGEOUS GIRL in tandem with MALIBU CURL, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking briefly inside
into the turn, tipped to the two path near the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on to chase the winner home while clear for
the place honors. MALIBU CURL broke out a step at the start brushing COURAGEOUS GIRL in concert with the aforementioned foe, chased five then four
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, offered up a bid four to five wide at the head of the stretch, dug in under a drive weakening in the late stages
while clear for the show honors. VIENNA CODE showed the way in hand three then two wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, yielded the
front near the quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. MAYBE LATER chased four to five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened.
COURAGEOUS GIRL got brushed between foes at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper
stretch and trailed.

Footnotes
MR PHIL was hustled to the front, contested the pace on the inside of a foe, vied inside around the turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole,
came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. FORTIN HILL disputed the pace on the outside, was urged along
in the three path around the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. CHESTERTOWN moved up on the
outside under urging, chased four to five wide around the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened but just held the show. LOBSTA
tracked the pace down the backstretch, went four wide early on the turn then dropped to the two path, chased into upper stretch and tired then just missed
the show. ZOOMER broke a step slow, settled at the rear, was urged three then four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
WHISTLING BIRDS settled near the back, was urged along in the two path on the turn, dropped back quickly late on that bend and faltered then was eased
but walked off.

VOCALIZE just off the pace four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn and steadily advanced in hand, swung
four to five wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, rallied to take command nearing the eighth pole under a drive, edged clear under mostly his own
power and momentum geared down to the finish to score. BROKEN SPUR three to four wide in closest aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the
turn and increased the pressure on the front, took over command near the quarter pole and was roused spinning three wide into upper stretch, dug in under
threat and was collared near the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second best. STARRYSTARRYKNIGHT showed
the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under increasing pressure from the aforementioned foe and was placed to coaxing
near the quarter pole, got displaced from command and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late stages while just preserving the
show honors. JIMMY THE BOOT broke out at the start and was corrected, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off
the inside through the turn coaxed along from three furlongs out, angled five wide to six wide into upper stretch and improved position through the stretch.
WEGOTTAGUY three wide in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked inside through the turn and was ridden along midway, angled four wide for home and
weakened in the stretch. FAZARO four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn and was patiently handled
until let out angled six wide into upper stretch, then offered no response. EMPIRE RIDGE chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, went
seven wide at the head of the stretch, tired. NECROMANCER got bumped at the start and squeezed back when GOOD TIP veered outwards, chased three
then two wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went eight wide at the top of the stretch and made no impact. THEREGOESMYMIRACLE chased
along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. GOOD TIP veered out at the
start bumping and squeezing out NECROMANCER against COMMITTED, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide
through the turn, went five wide for home and tired. COMMITTED got bumped at the start by GOOD TIP veering outwards, chased four then three wide
