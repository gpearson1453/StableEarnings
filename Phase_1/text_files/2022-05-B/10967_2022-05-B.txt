Footnotes
HELLADIC broke sharp and quickly cleared, padded the lead around the turn, widened under a drive to the eighth pole and held safely in the end. COURT
SNORT was moving around just before the gates opened and came away a bit slow from outside, chased from outside then angled to the two path for the
turn, remained off the rail to the stretch and put in a late run to best the rest. CHERRY CHAOS hopped and came away slow, steadied repeatedly while
racing greenly up the backstretch, angled out and exited the bend three to four wide and gained the show. DADDY CLASSY DILL broke slow and inward,
chased along the rail to the stretch and never responded to urging. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE got bumped from outside leaving the gate, chased between
then was shuffled back early, lugged out at the seven-sixteenths, raced greenly on the turn, lacked room behind a pair of rivals and steadied briefly at the
top of the stretch and could not regain momentum. ACQUIRED CLASS tossed his head then broke in and bumped, chased the pacesetter while outside a
rival, started to weaken two wide on the turn and had little left for the stretch.

Footnotes
CHROME OF OUR OWN settled off the leading pair, traveled along the inside then tipped two wide leaving the turn under urging, steered out in the stretch,
rallied and outclosed STOIC LUNA in the end. STOIC LUNA broke in a bit, settled early outside a rival, ridden along through the turn while two then three
wide, got floated out in upper stretch, rallied in tandem with CHROME OF OUR OWN but got outclosed for the victory. LUNATIC dueled for command into
the turn, held a short lead over STARSHIP DEFIANT through the turn, shook free in upper stretch but got run down by the top pair. STARSHIP DEFIANT
dueled outside LUNATIC for the early lead, battled two wide around the turn, could not kick with that rival in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
BACK ON THE STREET broke out, dropped back and trailed early, navigated the turn four to five wide and was not a factor.

Footnotes
BARRISTER'S RIDE settled on the inside, crept closer up in the middle stages, tipped out into the stretch, angled out in the lane and got up late. CARMEN
MIRANDA took control from inside, got pressured on the far turn, maintained a short lead into deep stretch and was overtaken late. MADIHA was closest in
pursuit in the two path, bid from outside on the far turn, fought into deep stretch and lacked the needed late punch. HOT ON THE TRAIL stalked in the three
path, remained off the rail to the stretch, moved out widest in the drive and finished willingly. BIG CLARE tucked inside quickly from off the pace, moved out
on the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then four wide, drifted in a bit in the lane and failed to menace. QUEEN OF POMPEII moved around prior to
the start then reared as the gates opened, sat off the pace in the two path, angled to the inside past the quarter pole and failed to rally. THE STEWARDS
REVIEWED THE START OF QUEEN OF POMPEII AND RULED THAT SHE WAS MOVING AROUND PRIOR TO THE START, THEN REARED JUST
BEFORE THE GATES OPENED, CAUSING HER OWN PROBLEMS AND IS RULED A STARTER.

BREAKFAST RIDE sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led a bit off the rail through the turn, put to right-handed urging in the final furlong
and drew away. MAXIM MOMENT stalked along the inside, boxed in through the turn and had to wait for an opening, tipped at the top of the stretch, bid
under right-handed urging but faltered in the final sixteenth. TAHOE SECRETS raced up close to the outside of the pacesetter, traveled two to three wide
around the bend and weakened in the lane. NYQUILER broke slow, came out and was erratic while dropping back, went three to four wide around the turn
and was not a factor. SILENT DECLARATION traveled in range outside rivals then off the rail, took the turn three then two wide and could not rally.

Footnotes
HOT BOX dueled for command from outside into and around the turn, put away inner rival with a furlong remaining and held on in the closing moments.
COALINGA ROAD traveled in mid-pack outside a rival, rounded the turn two then three wide, steered out in the lane, closed fast and but was too late.
TRAINER PLEASE chased outside a rival to the turn, went two wide around the bend, tipped out a bit in the drive and needed to find more in deep stretch.
BRUTTO traveled near the back early on, took the turn two wide, angled out in the lane and summoned a mild rally to earn a minor award.
HOUNDSTOOTH broke slow from inside, tracked along the inside, tipped two wide on the far turn, raced in traffic in the lane and kept on to the wire. IKIGAI
dueled inside the winner to the stretch, lost touch entering the furlong grounds and weakened in the late stages. BABY GRONK chased the top pair from
inside and never found the needed response in the final furlong. STAR RACER broke slow and took up at the start, lost his action entering the turn, which
caused FREY to lose his right iron briefly before regaining his footing, came off the rail and was ridden out in the lane while never getting involved.

TIZZY TWISTER attended the pace outside the top pair, vied three deep around the turn, took over in upper stretch and drew clear late. TALKATIVE GAL
dueled from inside up the backstretch, fought with a trio of rivals while saving ground around the bend, fought into deep stretch and held the place.
PEQUENA TORMENTA broke slow and veered in, recovered and quickly gained up the backstretch before running up on heels and having to steady off the
leaders, climbed while angling five wide midway around the turn and closed well to gain the show. LOMA VISTA broke a bit slow in the beginning, dropped
back to last, went three wide into the turn, got floated six wide at the five-sixteenths pole, angled back into the three path, produced a mild rally between
horses in the lane and rounded out the superfecta. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY dueled for command outside TALKATIVE GAL, vied between runners on the
turn to midstretch and flattened in the final sixteenth. WORK TO LIVE chased from outside early, bid four deep on the turn and weakened in the drive.

once more and had to check into the turn, angled out and raced four deep into the stretch, ranged up from outside in midstretch and drew clear late.
STREET ART was closest in pursuit in the two path into the turn, bid from outside in upper stretch and got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth.
COWBOY CHARLIE bobbled leaving the gate but was still away quickly, set the pace on the inside into and around the turn, challenged by STREET ART in
upper stretch, fought into the final sixteenth and yielded late. BARSABAS brushed with outside rival leaving the gate, chased three deep early, got put in a
bit tight entering the turn lost ground, moved into the two path around the bend and finished evenly in the final furlong. TOFINO BAY brushed with
BARSABAS at the start, trailed early on and steered to the inside, angled out and entered the lane three wide, came out further in the stretch and failed to
rally. KO SAMUI (IRE) raced in range four deep into the turn, moved into the three path around the bend and weakened. IL CAPITANO jumped the dirt

Footnotes
ROPERS N WRANGLERS set the pace on the inside with company alongside, cleared that rival leaving the backstretch, maintained control into the stretch
and drew off under right-handed encouragement. TEAM CONCEPT brushed from inside at the start, got crowded by PEACEHAVEN early then went up to
press the pace from outside, lost touch with the winner leaving the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and held the place. PEACEHAVEN pulled and
steadied early and continued rank into the first turn, steered to the two path to chase the pace, kept on near the inside in the stretch and gained the show.
TIZ A MACHO GIRL hopped and broke out in the beginning, trailed to the far turn, went outside rivals and traveled four deep at the five-sixteenths pole,
angled to the three path leaving the far turn and got outkicked for the show honors. MENSA ON TAP steadied briefly along the inside, tracked along the rail
then tipped out in upper stretch and weakened. SQUILLIONS bumped rival leaving the gate, pulled and steadied early, settled in the two path outside a
rival, remained in the two path on the far turn and was not a factor. LADY DERBY broke in then shifted out and brushed rival, steadied off heels early then
settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and could not rally. BIG ROSIE got bumped by SQUILLIONS at the start, tracked three deep around the
first turn, dropped back three wide on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
