clear while drifting out. LAPIS STORM broke in front, dropped inside gradually, set the pace until mid stretch then was no match for the winner. LUCKY TO

faded. DESIGNATE passed tiring rivals. LUMINAIRE offered a mild bid four wide into the turn then came up empty. GOLDEN LASSIE chased the pace
three wide and was through after a half. FASHION FRAME had brief speed.

Footnotes
BILLY BEACOUP with the second flight two wide, rallied determinedly under strong right handed urging through the final furlong and got up in the final
strides. BRILLIANTBENNY pressed the pace two wide into the second turn, made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch and just missed hanging on.
DANES HEART made the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the rail into the far turn then was outfinished. GOING PRIMETIME went evenly.
ZAROSHA failed to menace. MARCH MAGIC stalked the pace along the rail into the second turn then weakened. NOSEY POWER was no factor. JUST
INSPIRED got out badly skipping over heels entering the clubhouse turn then was never involved. TANNER was never close, lost contact with his field on
the far turn and was eased to the wire. KISS THE DEMON trailed, also lost contact on the far turn and was eased to wire.

CURRENT CAUSE trailed down the backstretch, circled her field, closed with a rush in the middle of the racetrack and was along in time. SABELLE bobbled
at the start, sped to the lead, set all the pace then couldn't handle the late charge of the winner while drifting out late. LITTLE EMPIRE never far back,
swung wide and finished with good courage in the eight path. PLAYFUL SUMMER vied for the lead three wide into the stretch then weakened.
BELLAVALENCIA pressed the pace two wide into the stretch and gave way late. ICY RAIN failed to menace. TEST YOUR FAITH bumped at the start and
was no threat. HADLEN bumped at the start and was outrun.

FORTUNATE FRIENDS chased the leader into the far turn, rallied two wide to make the lead nearing the top of the stretch, set the balance of the pace and
drew off while drifting out under mild urging. LOOKS GOOD N A TUX allowed to settle, loomed boldly three wide through the far turn and held on for
second. KADESH retrained early, found his best stride late two wide. ZITMAN outrun early, had a mild late rally two wide. LONGLIVEJUSTICE was no
threat. SHELL FIRE was no factor. SMASH broke in front, quickly opened a daylight lead, widened before a half, set the pace for nearly six furlongs then
tired. BUCKY was through after a half.

Footnotes
ICONIC stalked the pace from the second flight three wide, responded with a burst of speed to make the lead in deep stretch and drew off under a strong
hand ride. CENTRIST never far back, rallied through the stretch in the four path and finished clear for second. CUTLER pressed the pace along the rail for a
half, inherited the lead, quickly shook clear then was outfinished. VENETIAN DREAM close up between horses, went evenly. IMPERIAL BREW failed to
menace. FREE SPEECH broke in front, set the pace two wide to the top of the stretch then weakened. UNCLE KEVIN was outrun. OWN THE TOWN was
through early.
