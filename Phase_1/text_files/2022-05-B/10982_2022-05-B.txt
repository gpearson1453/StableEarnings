Footnotes
GALOPIN GOURMET chased the early pace from the midflight, advanced on the turn, closed along the rail in the drive to confront the pacesetter nearing
the furlong marker, was on even terms with the runner-up through the final yards and just got the nod on the wire. ARMA D'ORO chased the early pace,
advanced two wide on the turn, continued that run into upper stretch, matched strides with the winner in the final stages and just missed for the win, while
besting the rest. OLYMPIC SILVER was sent along leaving the break while a bit rank early on, set moderate fractions while on a clear lead through the turn,
came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, was overtaken nearing the sixteenth marker and outfinished late, while clear of the rest for third.
VANDENBERG lacked early speed while saving ground through the turn and did not mount a late rally. CLASS PROOF was away a bit slowly but recovered
nicely to be close up into the turn, bore out leaving the three furlong marker and lost position along the turn and lacked a late response.
FROMAJACKTOAKING chased the pace to the turn, lost ground while two wide nearing the quarter marker and tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TIME TO SMILE stalked the moderate fractions through the turn, was roused two wide leaving the bend, advanced in midstretch, overtook the pacesetter
nearing the sixteenth marker and drew clear in the late going. DUBLIN BLUE ECHO won the break and set the moderate pace through the turn, had a clear
lead nearing the furlong marker, was on the left lead nearing the sixteenth marker and was overtaken by the winner but held for second in the end.
ROSARITA CARMELITA tracked the opening fractions, lost ground on the turn while three wide, advanced in upper stretch, was outkicked in the late stages
but was clear for third in the end. MISTICAL SURPRISE was shuffled back nearing the half-mile marker, was steered two then three wide along the turn and
offered a mild late bid but did not have an impact. ALY'S NATION steadied in tight quarters nearing the half-mile marker, chased the pace along the inside
on the turn and was not a factor. TRIBUTE TO JAZZ tracked the moderate fractions through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final
stages. FOXY FAX lacked early speed to the turn, came three wide nearing the quarter marker and was not a threat.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH kept close attendance to the fast early pace, advanced on the pacesetter approaching the second turn, overtook NUESTRO
ENGREIDO leaving the second turn, was confronted by the closing runner-up nearing the furlong marker and determinedly dug in in the final sixteenth to
prevail. EXECUTIVE CHEF saved ground while stalking the quick early pace, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was roused and tipped out to three
wide for the drive, made a steady gain on MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH in the final sixteenth but was denied by that determined winner and was a clear second
best. SYNC settled just off of the early pace, lost position while three wide on the second turn, was no match for the top two in the final stages but kept on to
secure third in the end. CANELITO settled just off of the pace while three wide on the first turn, made a three wide gain on the second turn but could not
sustain that bid and weakened in the drive. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was hard sent leaving the break and took command of the early pace, set quick
fractions while being prompted by the winner to second turn, could not hold off MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH in upper stretch, kept on to the final stages and tired
in the end. GO THRU THE HOLE was keen to go on on the first turn, settled off of the pace while saving ground to the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REMEMBER SUE was brushed at the start, settled in the midflight while saving ground in the early stages, angled off of the rail midway through the turn,
mounted a three wide bid into the stretch, was put to firm encouragement through the lane while steadily advancing and made a late push to prevail. JAYS
ANGEL was sent leaving the start and attended to the pace through the second turn, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch and edged to a clear lead,
was confronted by REMEMBER SUE inside of the sixteenth marker and could not hold off that rival's late bid and was tagged for the win, while holding for
second. MOONSHINE CAT tracked the early leaders from a two wide path, lost position while four wide on the second turn, swung widest into the drive,
re-rallied in the stretch to close with a rush in the final stages and challenged the top two in the end while securing third. ALISO BEACH was unhurried in the
early going, was steered to the rail along the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, angled out nearing the furlong marker and bumped TYCHE AWAITS
YOU, shifted towards the rail for the late stages and closed willingly in the end. TYCHE AWAITS YOU settled off of the early pace while three wide on the
first turn, shifted to the two path along the second turn while still in midpack, gained ground in upper stretch, was bumped by ALISO BEACH nearing the
furlong marker and altered course and lacked a final bid. BLUEBERRY MUFFIN was sent leaving the break and set all of the pace, came under pressure
nearing the quarter marker and relinquished the lead into upper stretch, stayed on into the furlong grounds and tired in the final stages. TEXAS CHARM was
away a bit slowly, was rank along the first turn while hard to place, lost contact along the backstretch run, was eased leaving the second turn and walked off
under her own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING IN MIDSTRETCH AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED
THAT ALISO BEACH IMPEDED TYCHE AWAITS YOU NEARING THE EIGHTH POLE AND DISQUALIFIED ALISO BEACH FROM FOURTH AND
PLACED FIFTH. AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF TYCHE AWAITS YOU AGAINST THE RIDER OF REMEMBER SUE AND THAT
OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ONE SILK STOCKING chased the fast pace from the second flight, was roused four wide along the turn, gained ground in upper stretch, came within aim
leaving the furlong marker and had a good late kick to prevail. ASCENDANCY tracked the quick pace to the turn, gained ground while three wide nearing
the quarter pole, continued that advance in upper stretch, responded to steady urging and took a narrow lead inside of the sixteenth marker but was
overtaken by the winner late and bested the rest. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY tracked the fast fractions by her stablemate, advanced at the top of the stretch, vied
for the lead inside of the furlong marker and was outfinished in the final stages by the top pair, while clear of the rest for third. HER PERFECT VISION was
away sharply and sped to the early lead, set fast fractions through the turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker, ceded the lead into the final
furlong and gave way in the end. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW was shuffled at the start and away slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, improved position in upper
stretch but could not sustain that bid and was not a threat. SOO BROOKLYN chased the quick pace from a two wide path along the turn and tired in the
drive. ON VACATION lacked early speed, was two wide along the turn while losing ground and showed little.

Footnotes
EDINBURGH EXPRESS took back in the early stages and tracked the fast early pace, was roused while two wide on the turn, responded to steady urging
leaving the furlong marker, closed fast to overtake the pacesetter nearing the sixteenth marker and edged clear in the end. LESSONS OF AUTISM settled
off of the early pace, lost position midway through the turn, was blocked while two to three wide leaving the bend, gained ground nearing the furlong marker,
was in tight and exchanged bumps with SPLIT ACES leaving the eighth pole, found his best stride late and could not reel in the winner in the end but was
second best in a good effort. TIZ VICIOUS hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, lacked early speed to the turn, improved position while two wide
along the turn, waited for racing room nearing the head of the lane, found that room in the final furlong and was outfinished by the top pair but was up in time
to secure third. EL TENAMPA lacked early speed, was roused four wide nearing the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, exchanged bumps with
SPLIT ACES nearing the furlong marker and flattened out in the late going. SPLIT ACES chased the quick early pace, mounted a three wide bid into the
drive, was in tight nearing the furlong marker, drifted out a bit and bumped with EL TENAMPA and did not offer a late rally. CORSICAN was sent to the front
leaving the break, set fast early fractions while on a clear lead, was clear into the final furlong but could not hold off the oncoming winner nearing the
sixteenth marker and weakened in the final stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING APPROACHING THE EIGHTH
POLE AND RULED UNANIMOUSLY THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER.

Footnotes
LOVESICK BLUES took back to stalk the quick early fractions, advanced on HAY JUAN nearing the quarter marker, overtook that rival into upper stretch,
extended the lead leaving the furlong marker and drew off in the end as much the best. HANDR'SDREAM settled off of the quick early pace, was roused
four wide into the drive, was outkicked by the winner in the drive but kept on to get the nod for second. HAY JUAN was hustled leaving the break and sped
to a clear early lead while setting fast fractions, was overtaken by the winner nearing the quarter pole, stayed on in upper stretch, weakened in the final
stages and just held for third and just missed for second. THE LITTLE H MAN was away a bit slowly and lacked early speed, came two wide along the turn,
made a mild bid in the final stages and just missed for the minor awards. THEYREMINISCEOVERU was forwardly placed to the turn, was three wide
nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. STRUT TO THE WIRE settled off of the early pace, lost ground along
the inside on the turn and was not a threat. FURY KAP was brushed at the start and away a bit slowly, chased the quick early pace, was climbing and a bit
rank into the turn, came four wide approaching the quarter marker and did not make an impact.

Footnotes
BOTTLE OF SMOKE away in good order, took an outside stalking position well behind the leading pair, gained some ground while still wide around the turn
and responded with a determined run when asked to get up in time. RESPECT THE HUSTLE hustled to the front, established a rail position allowing
DESCARTES to dictate the pace to the half, then made the challenge passing the half, putting that rival away at the eighth-pole and finished well but was
unable to hold off the winner. GALLANT WARREN saved ground early, raced mid-pack alongside BOTTLE OF SMOKE through the middle stages,
attempted to keep up when that one made an early move and followed him home, finishing without making up much ground on the eventual winner. ROCKS
AND SALT broke inward, intimidating ROCKTILLYOUDROP without making contact, straightened out and settled in a position with ROCKTILLYOUDROP
and J.T.'S WATCH at the back of the pack, fell back to last entering the far turn then launched an extended bid while four-wide, passing horses and finishing
with good energy. DESCARTES was asked for speed from the start and dueled with RESPECT THE HUSTLE while well clear of the field, led through
moderate fractions the length of the backstretch, engaged outside of that rival as they quickened pace around the turn but faltered in the final furlong.
ROCKTILLYOUDROP broke inward and steadied at the break, took the rail path round the first turn while last of a trailing trio, advanced a bit on the far turn
while continuing to save ground but never made an impact. J T'S WATCH broke a step slow and outward at the break, took a four-wide path around the first
turn while settling into position with ROCKTILLYOUDROP and ROCKS AND SALT at the rear of the field, responded briefly when asked to go but couldn't
keep up and lacked a late response.
