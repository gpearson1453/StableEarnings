Footnotes
LYNX was up close inside early, steadied multiple times nearing and entering the turn, angled three wide soon after, bid outside of TRUST ME nearing the
quarter pole, was initially repulsed but stayed on outside to be up and clear late. TRUST ME dueled two wide, drew clear in upper stretch and led to deep
stretch. ALTERNATE ROCK chased the pace four wide, lacked the needed rally and bested the rest. RIPLEY dueled inside early and retreated through the
lane. STEPHANIE'S CHARM was bumped at the start, saved ground, tipped out nearing the lane and never threatened. HONOR TORI was off slow, raced
four wide and failed to menace. SING SCAT broke inwardly and bumped STEPHANIE'S CHARM at the start, raced two wide and played no further factor.
GENUINE MISS was outrun while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BARONE CESCO trailed early after spotting the field a length or so at the break, rallied three wide to contention at the top of the stretch, caught
PARTNER'S HOPE from outside leaving the furlong grounds and kicked clear. PARTNER'S HOPE pressed the pace three wide, took over from PURE
SPEIGHT after three furlongs, wandered out in midstretch yielding to the top one, and ran on best of the others. FROSTED ARMOUR saved ground on the
turn, moved out for the drive and finished evenly. PURE SPEIGHT set a pressured pace hounded from outside by PERFECT PICTURE and PARTNER'S
HOPE, and gave way through the last eighth of a mile. PERFECT PICTURE pressed the pace between horses, and faded a quarter-mile out. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.

MANUELA settled off the pace while racing three wide, bid four wide nearing the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch and edged ahead under a drive.
PEARLINTHEROUGH disputed the pace three wide between foes, could not quite match strides with the winner in upper stretch but fought on to be clearly
second best. ELLIEREESEASTON was off slow, raced five wide around the turn and churned on to gain the show late. GONE TO CABO stalked the pace
four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole and flattened out in the stretch. MISS BETH'EL failed to menace while racing five wide. PRESSLY'S HOPE rated just
off the early pace inside, dueled inside around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. DOLCISIMA vied two wide between foes and
retreated through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MALRAUX set a pressured pace inside, and dug in gamely through a long drive to keep STAR WEAVER at bay. STAR WEAVER tracked outside the early
leaders four wide, ranged up with a clear shot outside MALRAUX into the stretch, stayed on his left lead through a long drive and did not have enough. NO
NAY MAYBE (IRE) sat off the first flight in the clear on the turn, swung widest for the drive and did enough to get up for the show. BACKWOODS BOOGIE
raced three to four wide, and lacked the needed rally. KATIE'S COWBOY bumped with PHASE OUT at the start, and was outrun inside. GRAN MALBEC
was no factor two wide. PHASE OUT bumped with KATIE'S COWBOY at the start, pressed MALRAUX from outside, lodged a brief bid near the
quarter-pole, then faltered into the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

MEAN MACHINE rated back nearing the first turn, stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide to split rivals near the quarter pole, reached near even
terms outside of TULFARRIS in midstretch, dueled from there and prevailed. TULFARRIS (GB) stumbled at the start, pressed the pace two wide, took the
lead near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth pole and fought to the wire. THE BEST
DISTANCE settled off the pace while racing two wide around the turn and ran on for the show. STREET FACTS hesitated at the start, was in range two and
three wide and faded around the far turn. ROWDY JESS was outrun inside. BACKATYA was off a step slow, set the pace along the rail and retreated
through the lane. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

SHES ALL WOMAN pressed LET'S BE HONEST from outside, took over after straightening away for the drive, and kicked clear under mild urging. LET'S
BE HONEST set the pace in the two-path, could not cope with the winner turning for home, and drifted out steadily while able to salvage the place.
AWESOME ANNMARIE went evenly through a ground-saving journey. SOPHIA'S STORM tracked outside four wide, was ridden along for a response
outside the quarter-pole, but lacked a response. PLAYERA faded after a half-mile on her left lead. KOZY DREAMS broke a step slow, and was no menace
three to four wide.

HA' PENNY was in range while racing two wide, bumped I BELIEVE IN MAGIC while hunting for room in upper stretch, got through between rivals in
midstretch and powered clear. PEACHY WEACHY tracked the pace four wide, took the lead in upper stretch, was no match for the winner but kept on to be
a clear second. EASY COME EASY GO raced off the pace four wide and stayed on outside to gain the show. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC stalked the pace three
wide between foes, was bumped in upper stretch and weakened. DIA DE SOL chased the pace three wide, angled six wide nearing the eighth pole and
lacked the needed rally. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO threw his head at the start and broke in a tangle, saved ground off the pace, swung out nearing the eighth
pole and never threatened. GRACELEADSUSHOME set the pace two wide, briefly cleared late on the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and wilted.
WASSER was off a bit slow then steadied soon after, raced two wide and made little impact. MI NEGRITA hit the starting gate, rushed up inside, vied inside
for six furlongs and stopped. ROBBING ROBIN had brief speed four wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
SIR TERRE was reserved early inside, advanced behind the leaders in the two-path after six furlongs, dove to the rail cutting off a spent DAKOTA BOY near
the eighth-pole, battled inside KEN LOVES KITTEN from there and prevailed after an exchange of brushes late. KEN LOVES KITTEN was well placed in
easy striking range, split horses at the top of the stretch, dueled outside SIR TERRE through the final furlong, brushed late with that rival and just missed.
CHEF MENTEUR gave chase outside DAKOTA BOY to the far turn, bid three wide past the quarter-pole, but could not kick on with the top two through the
lane. DUNKLE settled in the second flight two to three wide early, and improved past tired horses. BIRDNOTE raced two to three wide and was no threat
through an even effort. GEMINI MOON saved ground to no avail. CHARMING CHARLIE was off slowest after getting bumped between horses, raced four
wide early, and never menaced. DAKOTA BOY set the pace inside, and steadied behind the eventual winner while tiring approaching the furlong grounds.
SILVER MATT bumped with CHARMING CHARLIE at the start, and was outrun. RECTANGLE bumped with CHARMING CHARLIE at the start, and was
outrun. AS DE ORO COCO was far back throughout. PEMBERTON was slow into stride, dropped far back after six furlongs, and jogged in. RUN-UP
UNAVAILABLE.
