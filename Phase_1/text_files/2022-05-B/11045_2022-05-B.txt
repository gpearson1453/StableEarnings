Footnotes
MARKET DEVELOPMENT dueled from inside to deep stretch, responded well and drew off. ILLBOOTENGOTTY hounded winner throughout, headed past
the eighth pole but out gamed in the final furlong. GRAN ROJO off rail position to turn, angled in greenly in late stretch for show spot. COMIN' BACK broke
awkward from the gate, rushed to turn, went widest past quarter pole, stayed game in the final furlong but could not gain in the final furlong. JUST CHITU
broke slow, unhurried early, raced on through traffic in the stretch run finished up well in a good effort. RAULITO broke sharp between horses, tried hard,
could not keep up from inside through the stretch run. CALL PAPA had a terrible start, far back throughout, wide into the stretch and never menaced.
MONEY PIT saved ground with no late kick when needed in the stretch run. SIROCCO chased to pair to the turn, surrendered and dropped back.
