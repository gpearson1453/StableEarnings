KEEN CAT tracked the pace while three wide, was gamely on the far turn, exploded in the the stretch and cleared late to prevail. BIG CHOPPER set the
pace from the inside, was in a long drive to clear the far turn but was caught in deep stretch. LIGHTNING STRUCK settled five wide down the backstretch,
made a mild bid on the far turn into the stretch and was just up for show. DURANGO JESS pressed the leader while two wide down the backstretch into the
far turn, was hard used and gave way in the end missing the show prize. IN THE MIDST settled four wide then continued to bid on the far turn and was even
throughout the stretch drive. SILENT POWER angled in on the first turn then trailed throughout.

SPEIGHTSVILLE made the lead, traveling two wide, under constant pressure from a foe on the inside through the turn, and ran wire to wire with a slight
edge to hold on for the win under a driving finish. R DOC was near the back, early on, racing four wide then rallied in the turn to close the fastest and get up
for place. REQUISITION was allowed to settle in the early part of the race, then made a move in the turn, closing up the rail to grab show. BIG BERNIE
pressed the pace from the inside, and gave way in the stretch drive. BOLD N WILD was mid field, three wide and no menace. TEXAS SKYWALKER stalked
the pace, two wide and was no factor.

Footnotes
BIONICA dueled for the lead, swapping positions back and forth with VIOLENT HAILSTORM, then digging in before the wire, to grab the win with a strong
surge. VIOLENT HAILSTORM dueled for the lead, trading positions with BIONICA, but was out finished late, holding on for second. FAST AND FEMININE
was near the back early on, then angled out around the turn with a mild bid to get up for show. JJ'S AMERICAN DIVA chased the pace from along the
inside, made a bid in the turn and flattened out in the stretch. SUMMER CAT dueled for the lead early on, then faded at the three eights pole. ROYAL
BONUS trailed the field throughout, two wide and showed little.

the end. BESSIE'S SONG was off slow then moved up to press the pace four wide, was in tight on the turn, but continued to rally mildly in the stretch and
kept on for third. PHARME'S PHINALE stalked the pace while four wide, then continued to bid six wide on the turn but flattened out in the end. WITTS
QUESO vied for the early lead while three wide, then dueled with an inside rival on the turn, was hard used and faltered in the stretch. KATHYS CUP OF

HORN OF PLENTY got in tight and was checked at the half mile pole, looking for racing room, then shook loose, angling out at the head of the stretch,
closing well for the win. DARYLSLITTLEDIABLO stalked the pace, going three wide, rallied down the lane, battling PREFERITO DA BARBI, and held on to
take second in late stretch. PREFERITO DA BARBI made the lead, dueling briefly in mid stretch, and faltered late, holding on to show. ELUSIVE D'ORO
was near the back, traveling four wide, and offered a mild bid in the stretch drive. LOOKIN HIGH had no early foot, then angled out on the turn, to pass tiring
rivals in the stretch. AUTOCRATIC was near the front, along the rail and failed to respond down the lane. MR HANDS ON was in contention early, three
wide, then dropped back in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE WOMAN stalked the pace, traveling three wide, rallied in the turn to gain command at the eighth pole and draw off from the field, winning
easily. STORMIEIS BLUE had no early speed, angling out going into the turn, and closed fast in the stretch drive, getting up for place. HAPPY SAILOR was
mid field, going four wide throughout, made a mild bid down the lane and held on for show. PRINCESSOFCHITOWN stalked the pace early, two wide and
failed to fire. SHELLBY made the lead early, drawing clear of the field and then tired in mid stretch. POLLY TIZ was near the back, along the inside, and
passed a tiring rival. FIRE OF GOLD chased the pace, four wide and dropped back in the turn.

Footnotes
TATANKA made the lead, then was mildly pressed by BRICK TOWN around the turn, and drew clear in late stretch, to grab the win convincingly. BRICK
TOWN stalked the pace early, then pressed the leader around the turn, and was unable to overtake, being second best on this day. RVINDICATED was
allowed to settle toward the back, then closed, traveling four wide, to take third. RONIC chased the pace from the rail, then flattened out in the stretch drive.
SCHMOOZE was mid pack, racing three wide and offered a mild rally down the lane. RANTHEREDLIGHT had no early foot, traveling along the rail and
failed to respond. KEYS INCLUDED was near the back, three wide, and showed little. DUDE PERFECTA was mid pack down the backstretch, along the rail
and dropped back in the stretch.
