Footnotes
OUR SWEET PEA pressed leader from the 2 path, roused while 2 wide mid way along the far turn, headed the leader while passing the 1/8th pole and
edged away. BON FIRE DIVA set the pace inside, coaxed when challenged passing the 1/4 pole, continued to battle grudgingly before yielding in the final
strides. TINAS SHINING STAR trailed early, saved ground while inside while ridden along the far turn, continued to respond down the lane to improve for
show. LADY WOOD tracked inside, tipped out to the 2 path into the stretch, but flattened. BELLSWILLBERINGING chased while far back from the rail,
tipped into the 3 path for the stretch, but was empty. BRYCENS GOLD stalked from the 3 path, ridden to keep up while 3 wide on the far turn, but was tired
in the stretch. ESTA CHUCK raced off the pace between foes, ridden 2 wide along the far turn, but failed to respond. OFFLEE GRAYSFUL was well back in
the 7 path on the first turn, and was no threat.

Footnotes
GINA pressed from the 2 path, headed the pacesetter while 2 wide mid way around the turn, tipped into the 3 path down the stretch and drew clear.
FISHERS was well behind early, roused while 2 wide along the far turn, tipped into the 3 path for the stretch and ran on for place. MYGIDGETMARIE set the
early pace, asked for more when challenged mid way around the turn, but was tired in the stretch. CHEZ SOLEIL stalked the dueling pacemakers inside,
ridden along to keep up passing the 1/4 pole, and was flat in the stretch. BELIEVE IN FREEDOM was well behind early and never factored. I LOVE MARIA
was slowly away and never a menace.

OUTRAGEOUS BET chased from the rail, ridden along while making progress 4 wide on the turn, continued to rally down the stretch and just got up. MY
MAN POTS N PANS broke out at the start, tracked from the 2 path, challenged leaders while 3 wide into the stretch, continued to run on before getting
nosed out for the win. SANDY LANE KITTEN broke well to set the pace, cut the corner and opened up into the lane, but was rundown by the closing duo.
MOROCCO had trouble loading, unhurried and inside early, fanned 5 wide into the stretch, and improved position. JAG was steadied just before the first
turn to stalk the leading duo, continued to stalk inside rounding the far turn, but finished evenly down the stretch. THORNY TALE broke in at the start but
rushed up to press the pacemaker, ridden while 2 wide along the far turn, but was tired down the lane. BEACH TRAFFIC trailed and was 2 wide early, raced
inside along the turn but was flat in the stretch. FLAT OUT FLYING rated 2 wide early, but was empty in stretch.

Footnotes
DIVA READY stalked from the pocket, easily split the leading pair turning for home, assumed command entering the lane, drew off under driving pressure in
upper stretch, and was ridden out through the final furlong. THREE COINS laid off of the pace two to three wide, and rallied on his left lead to claim place in
midstretch. LUMINIST bumped an outer rival before shying from an inner foe and losing momentum in the process, settled two wide, took the far turn three
to four wide and between horses before shifting five wide entering the lane, and stayed on well. CHAMELEON was bumped outwardly at the start, rated far
back in the two path, shifted two to four wide turning for home, and stayed on while inside of LUMINIST, but got outfinished by that one for show. FADE
tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, bid for place between horses in midstretch in pursuit of the clear leader, but was
outkicked leaving the furlong grounds, and faltered. LISA MARIE settled far back in the three to two path, and passed tired rivals. COFFEE BEAN tracked in
midpack two wide, chased under urging around the far turn, paused between horses passing the quarter pole, then lacked a rally and gaded.
ALWAYSINMOTION saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ABBY THE BULL DAWG bumped an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear along the
inside, and never got involved. BLUE SHAMROCK laid off of the pace three wide, but faded under a drive four to five wide around the far turn.
DETERMINED DREAM rushed between horses to set the pace in the opening stages, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's bid entering the
lane, and readily weakened. SHEER ALICE (GB) broke a bit outwardly at the start pressed the leader from the outside, but weakened between horses
turning for home.
