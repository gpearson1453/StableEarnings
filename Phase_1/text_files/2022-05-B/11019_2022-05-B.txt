Footnotes
BLUEBANK stalked the pace through the turn rallying to a clear lead in upper stretch proving much the best to win going away. QUANAH hustled up early
pressed then chased through the turn, overpowered in upper stretch would duel outside of rival salvaging place. OLD MAN MAC broke sharply pressing a
narrow lead early shaking clear on the turn, overpowered in upper stretch would duel down the lane missing place. GATORATER a step slow through the
turn swung out seven wide in upper stretch. LESTERS DREAM in close early was swung out for room playing no factor. DUNN DEAL raced evenly off the
pace fading in upper stretch.

left hand urging. FALLEN EMPIRE stalked the pace looming on the turn, was all out from mid track down the lane closing the gap after the fact. TWO GOLD
SPOTS slow early saved ground to upper stretch showing as best of others there along the inside. ROARING OCEAN chased early then weakened on the
turn managing to hold on to position through the lane. JESSE JONES faded on the turn. BO RHAPSODY was never involved. PALMETTO BLUE played no
factor. MASQUERADE BALL was always outrun.
