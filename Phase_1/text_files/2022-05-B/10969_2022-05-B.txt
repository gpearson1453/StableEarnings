Footnotes
BAHAMIAN DUDE broke alertly and controlled the pace, was collared into the lane, repelled that challenge and remained safe to the finish. TWICE AS
SMART raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, bid into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. FOREST SELECTION chased
outside, moved briefly closer in midstretch then flattened out. SPIRIT SOUL BODY trailed into the far turn, angled inside and lacked a rally. WAR DOCTOR
chased wide, drifted even wider into the stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TALL WATER bumped and eased back early, pulled inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled out and prevailed following a long drive.
ITMAKESMEWONDER alternated for the lead outside, shook off that foe, was challenged again from his outside and battled gamely to the finish. PRIDE
AND PASSION stalked the dueling leaders three wide, lost position on the turn then came again in the final furlong. FINAL STRIKE dueled along the rail to
near midstretch, resisted but weakened in the final stages. LETTHEBIGHOSSROLL eased back to trail the field early then narrowed the gap while no threat.
FRAT PARTY made a menacing wide bid on the turn then gave way through the stretch.

SALVATOR MUNDI rated on the rail and angled out leaving the turn then responded well when asked and won handily. DYNAMITE KARMA was unhurried
in the beginning stages then rallied on the turn while angling out and was second best. COMBATIVE pressured the pace in early stages and then took lead
mid-stretch and faded to third. DOCTOR WU rated early on, then was asked entering the turn while saving ground passing tiring foes. TRANQUILITY BASE
stalked on the rail then angled out for the drive , steadied entering the lane and offered little. TOMATO BILL set the early fractions and when headed turning
for home offered no bid. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INVOLVING TRANQUILITY BASE AND SALVATOR MUNDI ENTERING THE STRETCH WAS
DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
RED RIVER REBEL rated just off the dueling leaders, angled out at the quarter pole, wore down the pacesetter under a drive and edged clear in the final
sixteenth. CANDY OVERLOAD far behind inside early, swung very wide into the stretch to secure room and closed well to gain the place. NASHTRICK
chased in midpack then split rivals in the stretch with late energy to get up for the show. ALL CANADIAN earned a narrow advantage outside, moved clear
briefly, in the stretch but weakened in the final furlong. KID FORESTER alternated for the lead inside to the stretch and came up empty. BOSSY HOLIDAY
saved ground close up then began faltering on the turn. PRICELESS WILL stalked the pacesetters four wide down the backstretch and faltered. DIXIE
GIANT lacked speed, moved wide in the stretch and was no factor. ARGENTIUM dropped back at the start and raced far behind throughout.

CALL MY BANKER broke inwards then allowed to settle early, angled out turning for home and drew away. MISTER M V P rated while on the rail then
angled widest in the stretch and was second best. RAISE A PROFIT set the early pace while saving ground, was headed turning for home and fought
gamely to hold show. INVISIBLE FRIEND stalked the front runner while running in the three path on the turn and weakened down the lane. BENLION was
bumped on the break and trailed throughout. ARQUEBUS broke sharp and settled back of the field and offered a mild bid on the turn and stopped.

TAKE A CHANCE quickly took control with a long lead, widened easily on the turn then remained well clear through the stretch while put to a drive.
UPSTART GENTLEMAN trailed outside in the chute, advanced wide, narrowed the gap but was no threat to the winner. CANADIAN PHAROAH chased
between rivals down the backstretch, angled out in the stretch and closed well. COMMANDER TOM raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter and proved
empty in the stretch. GIANT CRITIC saved ground throughout and lacked a response. POUND GREEN broke out at the start and bobbled slightly, rushed
up between rivals then gave way. WHISKEY VICTOR dropped back early and raced far behind throughout.

Footnotes
BIG BROWN BREWSKII eased back inside early, swung wide rallying near the quarter pole then surged clear wide through the stretch. MOMENT OF
PEACE close up between rivals, split foes in traffic in deep stretch and got up for the place. POINT TO THE STARS alternated for the lead inside, was
collared into the stretch and finished willingly. THIS WAY OUT dueled outside to midstretch and weakened. CLASS IN MAX lacked speed, angled wide into
the stretch with a mild rally. MR. AGRO lunged slightly at the break, advanced three wide on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. MY BUYBACK was
pinched back and trailed early, raced inside then closed well without menacing. POT COMMITTED raced close up inside, awaited room on the turn, the
lacked a bid when clear. SNOOKERED raced far behind, moved extremely wide into the stretch and was no factor. ASCOT BAY dropped back early and
was never in contention. CHOICE PLAYER broke well but lacked speed and gave way.
