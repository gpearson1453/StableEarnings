Footnotes
RITHMICALLEA forwardly placed while three wide into the first turn, settled in the second flight up the backstretch, in traffic while waiting briefly late in the
final turn, hit a seam three wide entering the stretch, set down, bid inside the furlong grounds, edged clear under firm handling. WE NEED A FIVE narrowly
set the pace closest to the inside, continued to set a soft set of fractions the middle half, found more to extend his advantage in midstretch, gave ground
grudgingly to the winner late, well clear for the place. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST with the early pace while between rivals, dueled into the far turn outside the
runner up, could not match that one in the drive nor contain the winner, saved the show. FIFTYFIVE STRONG void of speed while racing outside, came four
wide out of the final turn, rallied mildly in upper stretch then flattened out the final furlong to be outkicked for the third spot. CYBER GUN four wide into the
first turn, pressed the issue three wide the middle half mile then began to weaken. DRAFT CHOICE under firm restraint toward the inside and behind the
leaders, continued in the second flight inside the winner, encountered traffic with that one, continued toward the inside then came up empty when clear for
the drive. MAJESTIC SOCIETY remained back in failing to menace.

Footnotes
DIXIE STAR off slowly, trailed well back early as a result, moved closer along the inside late in the turn, shifted out a bit for the drive, stalled upper stretch,
late push, up final jump. CUSTOM PRAYER broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch by daylight, shrugged off a mild bid from a foe exiting the turn
to be clear again, could not contain the winner to be nailed in the final stride. PACIFICISLANDTIME chased the runner up early, inched closer to that one
with a mild bid late in the turn, proved no match in the drive. KATS PICK balked at loading, broke with the top two out of the gate, prompted them for a half
three wide, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
TRIVISTA forward placed while three wide into the first turn, chased the dueling leaders the middle half mile, advanced and was three wide when moving to
challenge in upper stretch, wore down rival to be clear late. NOSY BANKER broke alertly, set the early pace inside, dueled closest to the inside up the
backstretch, gained a slightly larger advantage into and through upper stretch, responded when challenged by the winner then proved no match late, held
sway for the place. TURN ON THE MAGIC off a step slow, raced four wide into and through the first turn, continued outside, four wide again through the
second turn, rallied with good determination to narrowly earn the third spot. MAGEEZ void of speed while also breaking slowly, continued back into the far
turn, came six wide for the drive, advanced down the middle of the strip, outkicked for the show spot. ARCHIE within striking distance four wide through the
first turn, second flight through the second bend, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. GUITARZAN pressed the runner up off the
inside for a half, dueled with that one into and through the final turn then gave way in the drive. CHAOSMOS broke back, lacked a rally in failing to menace.
GREELEY WENT WEST was finished after a half.

Footnotes
VELVET ISLE broke well, prompted the two leaders from the three path, challenged on the outside turning for home, long drive to the wire, proved best
under brisk handling. MAW MAW'S SOPHIA moved up along the inside to set the pace, continued to show the way turn, in the two path turning for home as
the winner came calling, gave ground grudgingly to the wire. GILDED APPLE broke back, lacked speed for a half, roused four wide turning for home, rallied
while widest down the lane to be in time for the show. PEACEFUL VISION in mid pack while saving ground through the turn, came off the inside for the
drive, lacked a serious closing response while surrounded at the wire. FOR REAL ALICE broke alertly, vied up front in the two path, fell back late
backstretch, remained closest to the runner up through the bend, dropped to the rail entering the stretch, weakened the final furlong. GABY'S PROMISE in
the second flight while four wide into the turn, had little left for the drive. A WISH FOR MADELYN remained back in failing to menace.
TETHEREDTOTHETRUTH off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
CARLOS LOVES TEE allowed the early pace to go, tracked the leaders along the inside most of the backstretch, steered out and mounted a sudden bid
three wide into the far turn, narrowly showed the way into the lane, strongly clear the final furlong. US SECOND CUTE PIE chased the early leader off the
inside, challenged between horses and inside the winner into the far turn, dueled briefly with that one closest to the inside, proved no match in the drive,
gamely for the place while finishing up along the rail. STORM BREACH fractious while loading, broke with the field. four wide when with the main body in
the first turn, remained outside and was four wide through the second bend when moving closer, lost some ground to the top two into the lane, made a late
bid for the place, denied. TABLE ONE carried five wide into the first turn, raced well off the pace most of the backstretch, five wide again three furlongs out
when making a mild advance, flattened out the final furlong to finish up evenly. IRON BANNER settled off the pace toward the inside, moved closer into the
final turn, shuffled back steadily to trail midway on that bend, squeezed through a narrow opening into the lane and improved to the wire without posing a
serious threat. SUFFRAGETTE broke back, trailed for a half, moved closer with a mid move four wide and in traffic into the far turn, failed to sustain that
advance through the stretch. LAKE RUNNER broke on top, clear early, showed the way up the backstretch, faltered when headed early in the second turn.
SUMMER IS HOT in mid pace early, began a steady retreat after five furlongs, stopped in the drive, walked accross.

Footnotes
GIGABLAST broke sharp, showed the way out of the chute, continued to set a legit pace into and through the turn under a light hold, pulled away through
the lane under a steady right handed crop. SPEAK TO ME in the second flight early, moved out and advanced three wide into a striking position by midway
on the turn, proved no match for the winner through the stretch, game for the place. LONESHILOHSPECIAL within striking distance inside, continued to
save ground into the lane, challenged for the second spot the final sixteenth, outfinished. MIDNIGHT TRIP last away, trailed early, four wide when moving
closer late in the turn, steered inside the runner up inside the furlong marker, also challenged for the runner up spot in the late going, lacked late punch
between horses. NON BINDING lacked speed, raced back toward the inside, improved a bit through the lane without posing a serious threat. TUGBOAT
pressed the winner early from the two path, was finished by upper stretch. GOODNIGHT GRACIE in mid pack for a half, also tired through the stretch. OLD
FASHION AMOUR was finished early, trailed home.

CARRY THY CROSS took command just after breaking in good order, showed the way into and through the turn under light restraint, set down drive when
confronted, headed past the furlong marker, battled back in extremely game fashion to narrowly prevail at the wire. CORN POP back off the early pace and
the inside, came four wide into the lane when advancing into a contending position, challenged and put a head in front with a furlong remaining, furious drive
to the finish, outkicked in the late going to miss. FAMOUS YANKEE in the second flight inside, continued to save ground while within striking distance into
the lane, challenged up inside the winner on the rail with less than a furlong remaining, raced on equal terms with the top two the final sixteenth, also
outgamed at the wire. WHISKEY GENT pressured the winner from the outside for three furlongs, was in the three path and between horses into the lane,
weakened. CANDY SHOPPER last away, trailed throughout in showing little, vanned off.

Footnotes
HOT LE ROY behind the leaders inside, asked along midway on the turn, angled out a bit to be three wide and moving to challenge into the stretch, long
drive, proved best under spirited handling. ARCTIC ROSE broke on top, narrowly set the pace in the two path, held a narrow advantage into the lane,
extended drive between rivals, proved game to the end. LUNDI pressed the runner up from along the inside, continued to apply pressure into the lane, vied
past the furlong marker while remaining closest to the inside of the first flight, weakened late, saved the show. ONE PROUD BOY in the second flight off the
inside, came four wide into the lane while between horses, lacked a closing kick to finish up evenly. CALLTHEWOLFE last away, raced back and off the
pace, five wide through the turn, also one paced through the lane. MEAN CRUISER back off the pace while off the inside, five wide out of the turn, failed to
muster a rally as well. PAT ME DOWN remained back in failing to threaten. RARE STRAIN finished early, trailed home.
