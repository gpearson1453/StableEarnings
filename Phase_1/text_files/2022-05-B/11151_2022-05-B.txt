Footnotes
BIZZY ECHO bumped BOURBINA early, tracked outside the pace, forged command entering the lane, dug in to meet the challenge of her stablemate and
held stubbornly. SPARKLE OF HOPE attended the pace three deep, launched a bold bid four wide entering the stretch, came to near level terms a furlong
out but was unable to best the determined winner. BOURBINA was bumped and squeezed early, settled in hand, mounted her rally circling five wide and
was along for the minor award. MEGAN'S CLARA was forwardly placed along the inside, but lacked the needed response when put to pressure. RUN
FEARLESS failed to respond. ZMUDA showed little. FOUR DAWN set the pace along the inside through the turn and stopped.

Footnotes
I CROSS MY HEART prompted the pace outside, forged command inside the furlong marker and kicked away. GARDENLY came away a step slow, settled
toward the inside, took closer order through the turn, angled out entering the stretch and finished willingly to clearly prove second best. OAXACA set the
pressured pace along the inside, weakened during the drive but had enough left to preserve the show spot. PONTIFFANY was forwardly placed along the
inside, angled out into the lane but failed to make headway. NOGRATZ contended three deep through the turn and faded. MAXINE'S CANDY was unruly
and unseated her jockey in post parade, was quickly captured, was forwardly placed between runners early, but came up empty before going a half.

Footnotes
FIGHTVILLE disputed the pace along the inside, shook clear leaving the turn, widened into the lane, was kept to task and held safely. PLEMMONSTON
was allowed to settle, launched his bid circling five wide into the stretch, failed to menace the winner but continued on well to prove the best of the rest.
BARSTOW stalked the pace moved up to join he leaders leaving the turn, but flattened in the drive. EL FRANCO was allowed to settle, made a sweeping
move six wide and improved position. CHASE TRACKER settled saving ground, shifted out entering the lane but lacked a response when called upon.
KIDYOUNOT broke sharp, contested the pace outside, but faltered between horses entering the stretch and gave way. TIGHTWAD was forwardly placed
between horses, tucked in to save ground on the turn, but came up empty after six furlongs and faded. MO HEAT showed little. STUD PUPPY was always
outrun.

Footnotes
CHILENO attended the pace along the inside, got through and was fully extended to narrowly prevail. JEEPER stalked the pace, launched a bold bid four
wide, fought on but wasn't quite good enough. GATE RUNNER lunged at the start and came away slow, settled in hand, mounted a five wide move through
the second turn, loomed a danger but was unable to bridge the gap. CONSPIRACY FACT opened clear to dictate terms toward the inside, drifted out a bit
into the stretch, battled on between rivals but grudgingly gave in. G FLAT stalked the pace, moved up three wide to engage for the lead, contested the issue
to the final furlong and flattened. SUPERCOOL settled off of the inside but lacked a response when called upon. MAGNIFICUS was never a factor. TOUCH
CODE showed little.
