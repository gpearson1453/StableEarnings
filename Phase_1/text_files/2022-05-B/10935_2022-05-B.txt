Footnotes
QUE PASA MUFASA, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, switched outside the pacesetter racing into the far turn advancing to
challenge, took over nearing upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. LEFT OF CENTER tracked off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, angled inwards after a half, continued along the inside and prevailed for second in late stages. GAME OF INCHES, urged to the lead between
foes racing to the first turn, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the far turn a bit off the inside, dueled inside the winner on the second bend and gave way
into upper stretch. FINAL TABLE, off a bit slowly, settled along the inside racing to the backstretch and continued evenly into the stretch. TIMBER LADY
proved no factor. DELUSIONAL DREAM, urged three wide pursuing the pacesetter into the backstretch, gave way after a half.

Footnotes
HOLDENTIGHT angled to the inside prompting the pace through the backstretch, edged forward racing into upper stretch and prevailed under firm handling.
BOOTLEGGIN POSSE tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and edged a rival for
the place honors. STILLWATER BROWN, urged between foes through the backstretch pressing the pace, dueled into upper stretch to strike the front but
weakened in late stages. BLAZEN BLUFF tracked off the second flight along the inside racing into the turn and continued evenly into the stretch. SHAQ'S
MY DADDY, taken back well off the leaders in early stages, improved position along the inside late. SIR BARNABUS, outpaced in early stages, was caught
wide racing into upper stretch. WEAREINITTOWINIT tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing to the turn, steadied midway through the bend and
quickly dropped out. HALO'S LADDIE joined the pace three wide in the opening quarter but gave way early.

Footnotes
KING NATE rated along the inside midpack to the backstretch, gathered momentum nearing the lane, swung out four wide in upper stretch and produced a
stout rally to wrest the advantage in time. PAPA RIZZO, dictated the pace along the inside on a narrow advantage under firm rating to the backstretch, went
clear leaving the far turn and was collared late. DAYS OF GLORY tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight to the backstretch, angled in on the far
turn to gain position racing into the lane but had no final bid. WAR CHEST tracked off the second flight along the inside and continued evenly to late stages.
ITS A BOY was rated between foes to the far turn, swung out four wide entering the stretch and continued with interest to gain some position.
CHOCOLATEICECREAM, caught four wide racing to the backstretch, lacked a closing response. IKE, bumped, then shuffled back out of tight quarters in
early stages, settled to the far turn and passed some tiring rivals late. BOURBON TAN, urged prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, gave
way into upper stretch. ANDREAS, reserved early, failed to menace. IMA HARLEY TOO was rated a bit off the inside to the backstretch and faded between
foes into the lane. KRAMDEN hopped at the start and trailed the field to the far turn. SMOOTH PAPA, pulled hard between foes exchanging contact with
IKE in early stages, continued a bit rank inside a rival in second flight racing to the backstretch and gave way racing into the far turn.

Footnotes
WILDLY DRAMATIC was rated off the first flight through the backstretch, angled to the rail nearing the turn to press the issue inside the pacesetter racing
into upper stretch and edged clear under pressure. SAILING ALONG settled off the second flight racing to the turn, angled inside entering the stretch and
produced a steady late run to prevail for second. FADED MEMORIES tracked off the second flight along the inside, tipped out three wide racing through the
stretch and was outkicked for second. MISS GLORIOUS, urged inside foes disputing the pace racing through the backstretch, switched off the rail setting
the pace on the turn and weakened when failing to match the winner. BIG BLUE NOTE joined the pace three wide in early stages and gave way into upper
stretch. WHAT NOW MY LOVE, urged between foes pressing the pace, gave way into the bend. INTHEMISTYMOONLITE settled between foes in early
stages and never gained contention. HOT AUGUST STORM dropped out early.

JOE PHILLIPS was rated off the first flight along the inside to the far turn, tipped outside the pacesetter nearing upper stretch and wrested a clear
advantage in time under firm handling. WHISKEY PLANK, urged inside rivals disputing the pace, edged forward racing into the far turn, resisted the winner's
bid to midstretch but proved only second best. MR. COUGAR tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, angled four wide nearing upper stretch and
continued with interest to prevail for a share. TURN THE SWITCH, urged three wide prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, faded into upper
stretch. LIGHT CRUISER, held up out of tight quarters early, settled along the inside, saved ground to the lane and improved position while no real threat.
EDGIE REGGIE, reserved off the second flight while angling inwards to the backstretch, gained position between rivals racing through the far turn but had
no late bid. TOUR THE WORLD, reserved along the inside early, angled four wide entering the stretch but made no impact. WHERE'D THE DAY GO
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch and faded after a half. VIOLIN MAKER, caught four wide between foes to the backstretch,
retreated early. ELUSIVE FREUD, urged between foes pressing the pace, gave way on the far turn. TWILITE LIASON, caught five wide racing to the
backstretch, dropped out early. SHINBORO proved no factor.

Footnotes
DON'T BOX ME IN, forwardly placed three wide attending the pace, continued with a steady bid in that path to wrest the advantage in upper stretch and go
clear under firm encouragement. NORTH ARM BAY, caught in close quarters in early stages, settled into stride along the inside, saved ground to upper
stretch and proved best of the others. KOVACS tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn, swung out five wide in upper stretch and
continued well enough to gain a share. MR. D'S LEGEND tracked off the first flight along the inside racing into the turn and came up empty in the drive.
DEPUTY LAW getting out despite some correction from his rider in early stages, moved to press the pace inside foes and gave way into the stretch.
DYNAMOMETER, urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. MARK OF VALOR broke
awkwardly and failed to menace. TAHKODHA KNIGHT was pulled up on the turn and vanned off the course.

Footnotes
A ROZE AND WINE, urged inside rivals disputing the pace racing into the turn, forged clear in upper stretch and widened under pressure. SILVER COIN
angled to the inside to track off the first flight racing into the turn, then made the most of an inside trip to prevail for the place honors. SKYKAT broke
awkwardly, was settled in the last flight, shifted out in upper stretch and split foes three deep while finding her best stride late. TIGER BAIT was rated off the
second flight along the inside and continued evenly. BOUNTY OF GOLD, urged three wide prompting the pace into the turn, gave way nearing the lane.
CIRCULODEGANADORAS tracked the leaders outside foes in second flight and faded racing into the turn. TRIPLE BOLD BABY pressed the pace between
foes into the turn and gave way midstretch. LYRICAL proved no factor.

Footnotes
HONEY BELLA, in touch with the leaders four wide attending the pace on the backstretch, shifted inwards pressing the pace on the turn and went clear
under firm handling. KNIGHT'S HONOR, urged disputing the pace between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside on the turn dueling for
command, couldn't match the winner but held well to save second. STONE ARCH BRIDGE tracked off the first flight inside rivals in the opening stages,
tipped out racing into the bend splitting rivals, shifted three wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed final kick. STYLIN N PROFILIN tracked the leaders
outside foes in second flight, advanced four wide racing into the turn but lacked a closing bid. MOONSHINE MOXY tracked the leaders three wide between
foes in second flight racing to the turn but offered no rally. WITHHERBOOTSON settled outside foes and continued evenly four wide into the lane. THAT
WOULD BE NICE, shuffled back at the start, angled to the inside while being prompted to advance racing into the turn, lost some momentum in traffic
nearing upper stretch and had no late bid. START SINGING settled outside foes, then angled five wide in the stretch while proving no threat. MADISONIAN
was held up avoiding close quarters after the break, settled near the inside early and proved no threat. MINKOTA JOY dropped out early. DUSTY FORD
made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but emptied out early. CELTICS WILDCAT flashed brief pace along the inside but emptied out early.

Footnotes
RUNAWAY READY broke readily, was eased off the leaders dropping behind the second flight, shifted out four wide entering upper stretch and produced a
steady late response to go well clear under firm handling. SWEET ANALYZER settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, shifted out four wide
midstretch and prevailed for the place honors on the wire. EYES FLYING BYE tracked the leaders between foes in second flight, shifted out three wide
racing on the turn to bid between foes in that path in upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. SCARYATCANTERBURY, urged along the inside
disputing the pace from the outset into upper stretch, gave way late. SILENT SAILOR urged pressing the pace outside a rival through the backstretch into
the turn, dueled between foes into the lane and gave way in late stages. WARBUCKS tracked off the first flight along the inside to upper stretch but had no
closing bid. HONEY'S SUPERMAN settled between foes in the last flight and proved no threat. WILDCAT HAGRID proved no factor.
