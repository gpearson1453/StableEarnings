Footnotes
VIOLENZA D'ORO broke outward, was rated on the front end between rivals on the backstretch, moved ahead when asked into the bend, took the rail,
battled WILDWOODS DREAM to midstretch then drew away while under urging until the waning yards. WILDWOODS DREAM bumped just after the start,
advanced widest, angled in beside VIOLENZA D'ORO to share the lead, was all out in the stretch, lacked the extra needed, returned bleeding from the
nostrils and was vanned off. AWESOME SKIPPY forwardly placed inside, swung out widest on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, fought for third and
edged ahead for the show in time. CRAPS SHOOTER displayed early speed between rivals, did not keep up into the bend, altered out as WILDWOOD'S
GAMBLE came out midway on the turnj, battled for third between horses in the lane but narrowly missed. WILDWOOD'S GAMBLE vied for the lead from
inside, also did not keep up into the turn, angled out trying to gain a clear path on the turn, was three wide in the lane and continued to yield the final eighth.
ANUNKA altered out some just after the start, bumped WILDWOODS DREAM, fought the rider briefly, was soon under control but showed little.

Footnotes
RIPE ATTACK stalked the early speed from outside, took over when let out on the bend then gradually opened up under urging the last eighth. YABA DABA
DOO broke alertly, contested the pace from inside, was no match for RIPE ATTACK when set down for the stretch run but held a safe margin for the place
under steady urging. COOL AMBITION a bit slow into stride at the start, was hustled up from inside, steadily progressed along or just off the rail to
midstretch then leveled off. JACK N JOHN chased from outside, lost considerable ground as she floated out through the bend but passed a couple tired
rivals in the lane. RICHIESONARAMPAGE displayed early speed just outside YABA DABA DOO but began to yield before finishing four furlongs. SONG
AND A KISS chased from between horses, came into the lane from path three and had little to offer.

FUTURE VISION gradually angled in while in hand on the backstretch, took over nearing the quarter pole then steadily lengthened command under a drive
in the lane. IMPERIAL TEMPLE altered in trying to keep a clear path inside FUTURE VISION MIDWAY ON THE BACKSTRETCH, JOSTLED WITH
bleeding blue until nearly to the half mile marker, took the bend three wide, fanned out some for the stretch run and drew away for second inside the final
furlong. MUNCH well placed inside, lost his path and was steadied behind HIDE AND RUN AWAY nearing the final two furlongs, waited for room, gained
second upper stretch, was all out the final furlong, began to wear down but lasted for the show. CALL ME DROSSEL bumped a couple times with
BLEEDING BLUE at the break, progressed two wide on the turn, was steadied and altered in when HIDE AND RUN AWAY came close midstretch then
gradually angled out as he pulled away from the rest the last sixteenth. BLEEDING BLUE bumped a couple times with CALL ME DROSSEL at the start,
jostled with IMPERIAL TEMPLE when the latter came in midway on the backstretch, was three wide on the turn, floated out widest for the stretch run and
gave way. HIDE AND RUN AWAY was sent to a clear early lead, took the rail and was challenged on the turn, could not stay with FUTURE VISION leaving
the bend, angled out upper stretch, yielded between horses, lugged in with a furlong to go, was corrected and continued to give way. DEXTER'S HARD
TIME was soon far back, though hustled along and proved unresponsive to urging in the stretch.

E Z TAPIT unhurried in the early going, commenced his bid widest on the turn, rallied five wide in the lane and got up in time under a well judged ride.
CLEVER BOY rated off the pace on the backstretch, went for the lead three wide on the bend, angled in some for the stretch run, moved clear inside the
last furlong but was outfinished nearing the wire. LEE LA DEW chased from inside, gradually swung out taking the turn, rallied belatedly between horses in
the stretch but was clearly best of the others. COPPER CROSSING prominent early, was boxed in through the bend, angled out three wide for a clear path
upper stretch then flattened out. SWEET LITTLE RUE raced in contention from outside on the backstretch but gave way widest with three furlongs left.
MACHO CLASSIC was hustled along to contest the pace outside BOLD ATTACK but began to tire before finishing a half mile. BOLD ATTACK contested
the early pace under urging inside horses, moved clear on the bend but gave way for the drive.

Footnotes
HOPTOWN HONEY pressed from between horses, went for the lead outside KHOZLE'S GHOST on the bend, floated out some upper stretch under
left-handed pressure, kept a straight path inside the last eighth and moved clear of the latter the final seventy yards. KHOZIE'S GHOST broke on top, soon
had the inside, was challenged on the turn, all out in the lane, gradually wore down the final furlong but was easily second best. WAR COLORS without
early speed between rivals, advanced two wide on the bend, lost ground fanning to path five for racing room entering the stretch, lodged a mild bid and got
up in the waning yards to share third. BAILESTON LASSIE in contention early, did not keep up two wide on the turn, fanned out some into the stretch,
regained a striking position with a furlong to go, moved clear for third soon after then leveled off in the late going. LINDALOUIMAGE void of speed from
outside, lost ground widest through the bend then passed tired ones in the lane. TIZ HOPPIN helped prompt the pace from outside on the backstretch but
began to yield from path four before finishing four furlong. PALAGO chased from inside, started to angle out leaving the turn, came into the stretch behind
TIZ HOPPIN and had little to offer. AFOOLER well placed inside on the backstretch, steadily yielded after three furlongs.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE inattentive in the gate, made a small leap when the race began and bumped with W W SCOUT'S HONOR, quickly recovered, was
checked while boxed in behind traffic for more than two furlongs on the backstretch, got through four wide into the bend, angled in some approaching the
quarter pole, rallied three wide under steady urging, fought on even terms with D' YANK and W W SCOUT'S HONOR inside the last eighth and edged
ahead in time. D' YANK pressed the early pace, angled in some on the turn, battled between rivals inside the final furlong but was outfinished in a game
effort. W W SCOUT'S HONOR quickly overcame a step slow start and being bumped from the rear to gain the lead from inside, was all out in the stretch,
challenged inside the final eighth and slowly yielded in the waning yards. DIAMOND MAXIMUS was soon chasing W W SCOUT'S HONOR from just
outside, found himself boxed in and waiting for room on the bend, altered out four wide upper stretch for a clear path and was closing the gap late. TWO BIT
KID raced in contention between rivals on the backstretch, was caught in tight quart4ers briefly into the turn, failed to keep up from path three on the bend
and lacked a significant stretch response. STALLONE was an early factor from outside but began gradually yield four wide on the bend.

Footnotes
ONE PUTT RICHIE bumped after the break, was settled in midpack, roused three wide approaching the two furlong marker, swung out five wide for a clear
path entering the lane, gradually lugged in under right-handed pressure midstretch, kept a straight path the final sixteenth and got up nearing the wire.
TORIN broke alertly, was soon chasing NORTH SIDE, moved outside the latter midway on the backstretch, drew clear on the turn, floated out some for the
stretch run, was under steady urging but did not have enough left in the late going. ONE WAY HOME well back early, was steadied briefly when his path
was taken into the bend, just off the inside on the turn, fanned out to path three entering the lane, was forced to alter out five wide after entering the last
eighth, closed well and gained third in the waning yards. AZRAEL lugged in some after the start to bump ONE PUTT RICHIE, progressed between rivals,
was two wide on the turn, took the rail for the drive, loomed a threat with a furlong to go but leveled off instead. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ prominent in the
early going, went for the lead three wide on the bend but flattened out in the lane. RULE FOLLOWER dwelt at the start, spotting the rest of the field several
lengths, advanced widest on the turn, drifted out badly into the stretch and only made up minor ground the final eighth. SYMBOLIST chased from between
horses, gained the rail into the turn and had no stretch bid. NORTH SIDE emerged with the lead after a sixteenth of a mile, began to yield from inside before
finishing four furlongs and was allowed to coast through the stretch. MIDNIGHT LEWIS chased from outside, gave way three wide on the bend and was
allowed to coast, as well, the last eighth.
