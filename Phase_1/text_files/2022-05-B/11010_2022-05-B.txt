Footnotes
IN HONOR OF AUTISM was hustled to the front leaving the break, opened a clear lead on the turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and was kept to task
through the final stages to win in a drive. DOGE OF VENICE was in a bit of a tight spot nearing the three furlong marker and shifted out to go three wide on
the turn, ran evenly through the stretch run and could not make an impact on the winner but was a clear second best. GLORY CITIZEN lacked early speed,
was two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung widest into the drive and passed tiring rivals late to be clear for third. BIG DIFFERENCE chased the pace
from a two wide path through the turn and gave way in the stretch. GUNNHILD was a bit hard to load, had no early speed, saved ground through the turn
and was not a factor. MADAME GAZELLE was prominent in the early stages while chasing the pace from the inside, lost position leaving the turn and tired
in the late stages.

KNOWN was crowded at the start, was unhurried in the early going, advanced on the second turn, mounted a four to five wide bid into the stretch, came
within aim nearing the furlong marker, overtook the runner-up in deep stretch and drove clear late. A MAN'S MAN kept close attendance to the early pace
then advance on SIERRA MELODY to prompt that pace to the second turn, overtook the pacesetter in upper stretch, was caught nearing the sixteenth pole
and was outfinished late, while besting the rest. SUGAR BEETS was never far back in the early stages, saved ground to the second turn, was roused two
wide into the stretch run and was outkicked late, while securing third in the end. KALINE stalked the pace while four wide early on, advanced position on the
backstretch run, came three wide on the second turn while gaining ground but did not sustain that bid in the drive and gave way. SIERRA MELODY broke
alertly and went to the front leaving the start, set the pace while being prompted through the second turn, was caught in upper stretch, stayed on into the
final furlong and weakened late. SOUTHEAST ASIA was never far back in the early going, was five wide on the first turn, maintained that wide trip through
the backstretch run and into the second turn, was asked for a response nearing the top of the lane and was empty in the late stages.

EL BERRINCHES tracked the early pace, lost position on the turn while along the inside, advanced in upper stretch, angled out leaving the furlong marker,
came within aim nearing the sixteenth pole and made a late surge to prevail. ROYAL JESTER tracked the fast pace, advanced while two wide on the turn,
overtook the pacesetter into the final sixteenth but was caught and outfinished by the winner late, while holding for second. BLAZING JAMIE settled off of
the quick early pace, was roused two then three wide into the drive, was outkicked by the top pair in the final stages but rallied for third. POLACCO was sent
leaving the break and showed good early speed while setting fast fractions, was clear into upper stretch, came under pressure nearing the sixteenth marker
and was caught and overtaken and just edged for the show. IMPRESSIVE CURLS chased the early pace, improved position on the turn while three wide
but could not sustain that run and lacked a late rally while on the left lead. ROYAL HEART was away slowly, lacked early speed, lost contact along the turn,
was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

SHADRACK settled off of the solid early pace while two wide, was steered to the inside along the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, tipped out leaving
the furlong marker, confronted MOHAWK KING leaving the sixteenth marker, headed that rival in the final stages and made a late push to prevail.
MOHAWK KING (IRE) broke alertly and was sent to the front leaving the start, set quick fractions while being prompted through the second turn, opened a
clear lead in upper stretch, was confronted by the winner inside of the sixteenth pole, met that foe's bid but was bested in the end, while clear of the rest.
TED was hustled leaving the break and kept close attendance to the quick early pace, drifted out leaving the five furlong marker, maintained position into the
second turn, could not keep up in the drive and gave way in the late stages, while clear of the rest for third. ECOLOGIST was allowed to settle in the early
going while saving ground, raced evenly to the stretch and did not offer a late bid. NOWHERE MAN bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was
unhurried through the opening stages, came two to three wide on the second turn and did not threaten in the end.

Footnotes
TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL kept close attendance to the early pace while three wide on the first turn, took command into the backstretch run, edged clear along
the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and was ridden out in the end. SPARKA (IRE) was unhurried in the early going, saved all of the ground
while racing in midpack to the second turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but was best of the rest. ALWAYS SEEKING was sent in hand along the
inside leaving the break and set the early pace, bobbled nearing the three-quarter marker while trying to get out, relinquished the lead to TAM'S LITTLE
ANGEL leaving the first turn, stayed in range through the second turn but lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the end, while clear for third. SEN
SEN settled just off of the pace while three wide early on, lost position along the backstretch run, maintained that three wide trip into the second turn and
was empty in the drive. BLUEBERRY EYES broke in at the start, recovered to stalk the early pace, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter marker but
could not sustain that effort and faded in the stretch run. HAPPY IS was allowed to settle in the early stages, was two wide into the second turn and did not
offer a late bid.

Footnotes
RIMPROTECTOR was unhurried in the early going, improved position on the backstretch run, continued that advance on the second turn, tipped out leaving
the second turn, made contact with YOU KIDDING ME leaving the eighth pole, came within aim in the final sixteenth and made a late surge to prevail.
CRAZY DREAMS was sent leaving the break and contested the early pace, drifted out to go three to four wide midway through the first turn, recovered and
took command of the pace into the backstretch run, came under pressure on the second turn, battled with TABLE FOR TWO into upper stretch, could not
shake free of that foe in the lane and was tagged by the winner in the final stages, while holding for second. TABLE FOR TWO settled just off of the early
pace, advanced while two wide on the second turn, pressured CRAZY DREAMS into the stretch run, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, was
outfinished in the drive but was clear of the rest for third. YOU KIDDING ME bobbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early going while
saving ground, mounted a three to four wide bid on the second turn, came within aim in upper stretch, made contact with the winner leaving the furlong
marker and was outkicked in the final stages. TAM'S TIME settled in the midflight while two wide on the first turn, lost position along the backstretch run,
came two wide along the second turn and lacked a late bid. FORGOTTEN VOWS settled off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced along the
backstretch run, was in tight and steadied off of heels nearing the quarter marker and did not offer a late response. TIZ A THRILL was sent leaving the start
and contested the early pace, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second turn and faded in the drive. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT INVOLVING RIMPROTECTOR AND YOU KIDDING ME LEAVING THE EIGHTH POLE AND IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF FINISH STEMMING FROM THE INCIDENT.

Footnotes
BETITO stalked the solid early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, took command off of the turn and edged to a clear lead nearing the eighth pole,
was kept to firm urging through the lane and held the runner-up at bay in the final stages to prevail. OUR EXPECTATION was unhurried in the early stages,
quickly made up ground on the turn while four then five wide into the drive, came within aim approaching the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in
the final stages but was best of the rest. MINOSO tracked the early pace, lost position while in tight nearing the quarter pole, gained ground in upper stretch,
was outfinished in the final furlong by the top two but held for third. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET chased the early pace, was three wide on the turn while
gaining ground, lacked room in upper stretch and angled out leaving the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final stages but challenged for third in the end.
GOBSMACK stumbled at the start, recovered to chase the early pace from the inside, lost position on the turn and did not mount a late rally. HULA KING
showed good early speed to the turn, was headed by POTENTE ALBA nearing the quarter marker, gave ground in upper stretch and gave way late.
POTENTE ALBA was sent into early contention, tracked the solid pace to the turn, advanced to duel on the front end nearing the quarter marker, lost
position in upper stretch and tired in the late stages.

Footnotes
UPO saved ground while just off of the early pace, maintained that rail trip into the second turn, shifted off of the rail and was roused three wide into the
drive, quickly took command in upper stretch and pulled away through the late stages. LINFIELD was allowed to settle, encountered traffic approaching the
second turn, angled off of the rail nearing the quarter marker and swung widest into the drive, made a good late rally, was unable to reel in the winner in the
late stages but was up for second in the end. SUNNY SPOT settled off of the early pace while two wide, made a steady advance along the backstretch run
and into the second turn, chased UPO into the stretch run and was outkicked in the final furlong, while just being edged for second. MEGAMEISTER settled
in the midflight while saving ground, lost position along the backstretch run, took up approaching the three furlong marker, made a mild gain into the stretch
run but lacked a late kick in the drive. HONG KONG COWBOY was sent leaving the start and set contested fractions to the second turn, was overhauled by
the winner in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. JEDI KNIGHT contested the early pace, kept close attendance to HONG KONG COWBOY into the
second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way late. KEEP ON DANZING was away a bit awkwardly but was forwardly placed in the early stages,
was keen to go on into the first turn, bothered MEGAMEISTER approaching the second turn and faded in the late stages. SEAHAWK CODY was unhurried
in the early going, trailed into the second turn and did not offer a response in the drive.

Footnotes
SILK ROAD SALLY vied for the early lead out of the gate, settled into a stalking position behind and just outside of NICOLE GRACE, kept that position
through the turn then took command leaving the quarter and drew off while under intermittent urging. MANGOTANGO broke out and bumped I'M SO
ADORABLE after the break, was the leader of the trailing trio down the backstretch, got first run passing the three-eights pole, emerging best of the rest
while being no threat to the eventual winner. SMOKINHOTREDHEAD broke with the pack but was devoid of early speed, got a rail run through the first turn
while remaining at the rear of the field, moved out to the three-path entering the far turn while beginning her run, fanned five-wide entering the stretch,
finished strongly to gain the show. ABSOLUTE SCENES (IRE) outrun to the turn, angled over to save ground, trailing the field alongside
SMOKINHOTREDHEAD, made an extended move following that one wide around the turn, emerged widest of all, ran on well. ALESHA broke alertly,
established a rail position early, was content to rate behind the the leading pack for a half, eased into contention entering the far turn but was unable to
provide the needed response and was passing tired horses in the final stages. NICOLE GRACE away well, took command and led the field through leisurely
early fractions, quickened pace when challenged by the winner on the turn, then was unable to keep up with the late pace in the final two furlongs. I'M SO
ADORABLE away cleanly, then was brushed by MANGOTANGO when that one broke out after the start, was keen to challenge for the early lead, was
hard-held into the turn but then settled and rated behind and outside of SILK ROAD SALLY, made a bid entering stretch while racing between horses into
the stretch, faltering in the final furlong.
