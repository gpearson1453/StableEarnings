THREE TIME CHARMER dueled three deep for the lead in opening stages, continued to battle for command into the stretch run, shook free from FLY
FIRST CLASS near the sixteenth pole and edged away. BORN AGAIN GEORGE raced in the back although never too far back, given cue four wide in the
upper stretch and finished with good response. FLY FIRST CLASS dueled inside of rivals for the early lead, battled back racing inside of the winner in the
final furlong then yielded in deep stretch. COLD SNACK THIRTY tracked the embattled trio around the turn, launched a bid in the upper stretch and lacked
the needed response for serious impact. SPEEDY DANSMERE dueled between rivals for the lead around the turn, came up empty past the furlong marker
then got vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
BOLD LEGEND hustled up to the lead and angled to the rail heading into the first turn, set the uncontested pace up the backstretch, continued to dictate
terms by a narrow margin on the far turn, given cue two wide turning for home, had more left in reserve, held off the bid from FLATOUTANDFOXY and kept
clear. FLATOUTANDFOXY stalked the pacesetter through early stages, made a move for BOLD LEGEND mid-way around the far turn, remained game in
pursuit through the lane but had to settle for second best. MAGIC IN A HAT tracked the pacesetter up the backstretch, hustled up three to four wide in the
upper stretch and sustained a steady bid for a share. FLYTA rated just off the inside in early stages, came out wider around the far turn, swung five wide
into the upper stretch and offered no late bid. FETCHING FURY settled in the back, chased three to four wide around the far turn and failed to rally in the
lane.

CHAMPAGNE BLING got bumped at the start, was ridden along the inside around the turn, cut the corner into the lane, tipped two wide for the drive and
prevailed for a share. GOODNIGHTSUGAR tracked the top pair in early stages, launched a bid mid-way around the turn, came three wide into the upper
stretch and chased evenly in the final furlong. BIND ME UP raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch and had a mild improve.
BLUEBIRD DAY was ridden along the rail around the turn, stayed inside through the lane and offered no late run. GRACIE G lacked speed, raced three
wide and failed to move into contention. CLINE TIME vied for the early lead with the eventual winner, continued in range around the turn then tired in the
