Footnotes
MORO MERICA started out running mid field, then angled out, in the stretch, four wide and closed with a rush, drawing off from the field for an easy win.
MORO WARRIOR made the lead, racing along the rail, then faltered in late stretch, but was able to hang on to second. ON THE HONOR ROLL chased the
pace early on from along the rail, then offered a bid in late stretch, between horses and got up for show. CLAIMJUMPER got away slow from the gates, but
offered a mild rally, traveling three wide down the lane. TEXAN BOY stalked the pace from the three path and offered a mild bid in the stretch drive. MANI
SURPRISE pressed the pace hard in the early stages, from two wide but dropped back at the head of the lane. CRESSON was near the back, going two
wide, and showed little. UNBRIDLED POSSE showed no early foot, racing along the rail and was no factor.

an exciting blanket finish. CHATON ROUGE was in contention early, racing near the leaders from four wide, made a bid coming out of the far turn, dueling
in the stretch for the lead and just missing at the wire. TEXAS TIDELANDS chased the pace in the early stages, racing along the rail, then rallied on the turn
to duel for the lead in the stretch and got outnodded at the wire. CROSS BOSS LADY pressed the pace early, racing three wide, then dueled in the turn,

Footnotes
SMASH TICKET pressed the pace from the outside down the backstretch, then gained command at the head of the stretch, drawing away from the field to
blow them away for the win. IT'S A GIRL was mid pack early, racing three wide, then rallied down the lane to get up for place, but was second best on this
day. ROLLIN CHROME had no early foot, racing along the rail, then angled out in the turn and closed, four wide to get up for third. REDEFINITION dueled
for the lead down the backstretch, racing along the rail, then gave way in the turn. SINNIN N GRINNIN dueled for the lead early on, going two wide, then
flattened out in the turn. THORNY ROSE was mid field, running along the inside rail, and had an even effort. HOT TUB HOTTIE was near the back, two
wide and showed little. DUCHESS OF ZMOR got bumped and bobbled at the break, then traveled five wide throughout and was no factor.

KALYPSO pressed the pace into the turn, bid three wide in upper stretch, dug in gamely and held on well for the win. BECCA'S ROCKET settled early
inside, split rivals entering the turn, then advanced three wide at the quarter pole, shifted four wide in upper stretch and kept on but could not get to winner
and was second best. DISTORTED FLASH was well placed along the rail, then continued to bid from the inside entering the stretch drive, was blocked at
the eighth pole, angled out for room and was along for third. OUR IRIS ROSE set the pressured pace inside, came out two wide in the lane while dueling for
command but faded in the final furlong and lost the show award. UPANDCOMINGSTAR settled in the three path, bid four wide on the turn, was five wide in
the stretch but had no rally. HEAVENLY RHYTHM chased the pace while four wide, was roused on the turn then weakened in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
IT MAKES SENSE stalked the pace down the backstretch from the outside, then closed willingly, racing four wide, to get up for an easy win in late stretch.
PAYNE had no early foot, then mounted a bid from the head of the stretch, looking for racing room, closing fast between horses to grab second. BOLDOR
chased the pace, saving ground along the rail, then made a bid, getting up for third. EMPIRE OF GOLD made the lead, drifting three wide down the lane
and hung in late stretch. MACRON was mid field, then made a mild bid in the turn and flattened out in the stretch drive. BYBEE was near the back, going
four wide, and failed to respond. RED N WILD showed no early speed, running along the rail and never fired.

Footnotes
KING OTTOMAN was well rated along the inside early, then settled two wide, down the backstretch and into the far turn, shifted out four wide, leaving the
head of the stretch, making a bid exchanging bumps with PRESIDENTIAL around the sixteenth pole and edged clear to prevail under a drive.
PRESIDENTIAL was settled in, being well rated early, then made a bid, four wide leaving the quarter pole, and under a left handed stick, drifted out in late
stretch for a game second. A. P.'S SECRET pressed the pace, down the backstretch racing two wide, made a bid in the stretch drive, but hung late, hanging
on to third. WIN THE DAY was near the back racing along the rail, then angled out and rallied going into the far turn but flattened out down the lane.
STRIKE HARD was mid field early, running along the rail with an even effort. FOWLER BLUE trailed the field early, from the inside, and passed tiring rivals
down the lane. COVER ME UP made the early lead, racing on the inside, then gave way in the stretch drive. GOT THUNDER stalked the pace, from the
inside, and faded in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SILVER PROSPECTOR was in contention early, racing on the outside, then closed, willingly down the lane, drawing clear in late stretch to grab the win
convincingly. MISH made the lead early on, then drifted three wide down the lane and gave way late, holding on for place. SHAAZ was near the front early,
racing from the two path, then made bid down the lane to get up for show. POPULAR KID pressed the pace from the rail early, then made a mild rally in the
stretch drive but hung late. RATED R SUPERSTAR was near the back in early goings, racing along the rail, then angled out five wide and failed to respond.
SHERIFF BROWN showed no early foot, going two wide, and had an even effort. FLASH OF MISCHIEF stalked the pace traveling four wide and flattened
out in the stretch. MINE THAT STAR was mid pack, going two wide and faded in the stretch. TESORO was near the back, going two wide and was no
factor.
