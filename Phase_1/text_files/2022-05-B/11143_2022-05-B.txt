Footnotes
CAROLINA SUN , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, secured command in upper stretch and drew off under steady handling. WINKED set the
pace along the inner rail, lost the lead in upper stretch and held the place. FASHIONISTA lacked speed, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied.
GHOSTLY NIGHT , steadied in narrow quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, swung to the five path in mid stretch and rallied. LADY
MOSLER , six deep in upper stretch, offered a slight rally outside horses. GOOD STORY , five wide mid way on the turn, was not a factor. SEAP broke
awkwardly, prompted the pace outside WINKED and gave way in mid stretch. MUSIC QUEEN , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened.
GOGO CHANEL broke sluggishly and was outrun. LOVE SAGA raced near the inner rail throughout and gave way. PRACTICAL KITTY , outrun, was six
deep turning for home. LADY CAGE FIGHTER raced well off the inner rail down the backstretch and faltered on the turn.

mid stretch, was kept to encouragement to the sixteenth marker then relaxed late. CAPTAIN CARDO chased to the inside of a trio of rivals, eased out under
urging into the lane and continued with good energy while holding down the place. TRIPLE TITOS was rated back from between rivals heading to the half
mile marker, saved ground and was put to a ride leaving the far turn, moved up along the rail past mid stretch but flattened out very late. DISPUTED
NOTION , two wide between rivals pursuing the early pace, shifted out three wide for the drive, stayed on to mid stretch then faded. BAKENEKO was hung
out four deep into the turn, lacked a kick leaving the three eighths and gave way. AMICALOLA FALLS , three wide between runners while chasing, failed to
go on around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
DREAM HAPPY stalked three wide, shifted out wider for the drive, closed between rivals while under left handed asking and forged ahead in the final yards.
HE ROLLS vied outside FOREVER THE BOSS, took a narrow advantage while dueling past mid stretch, remained on his left lead and continued gamely.
SPONSORED rated off foes early and settled off the inside, advanced four wide outside the winner approaching the stretch, was guided further out in the
track in upper stretch, ranged up past mid stretch, tried to lay in some and hung. FOREVER THE BOSS sped to the front and set a pressured pace towards
the inside, was guided three wide into the lane, ceded command past the three sixteenths, fought on past the furlong pole then weakened in the final
seventy yards. CALLYOURIGHTBACK saved ground early, angled out and lacked a bid. DOLICE VITA , off slowly after leaning in and hitting the gate, was
hustled up between runners, chased and failed to respond. DR RAGS dropped back off the pace while saving ground, came out for the drive and lacked a
bid.

Footnotes
FRIAR TUCK prompted the pace outside BOSS MAN J J, moved to apply more pressure nearing the lane, kept on doggedly under strong handling, moved
to a short lead in deep stretch and prevailed. BOSS MAN J J was urged to the front, set the pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted approaching
the stretch, briefly went back clear in mid stretch, dueled inside the winner through the final sixteenth, wandered outward in deep stretch and just missed in s
sharp effort. MANOLITO drafted back off the early pace, eased out and moved up between foes around the turn, dropped in near the three sixteenths and
closed steadily. SILENT SERVICE broke a step slow, dropped well off the pace leaving the far turn, angled off the inside leaving the three sixteenths and
came on late. FLANK SPEED rated close up while saving ground, swung out four wide for the drive, pursued past mid stretch then faded. SPEAK UNITY
lacked speed, raced four wide into the lane, drifted in and steadied off heels in upper stretch then lacked a bid. NEVER EARLY , away alertly, stalked
outside a rival early on, pursued three wide under pressure into the lane and gave way. An objection by the rider of SPEAK UNITY against SILENT
SERVICE for alleged interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
BY THE SEY SHORE lacked speed, worked between horses through the stretch and closed determinedly late to get up. SHELLY ISLAND , well back early,
swung very wide for the drive, gained a short lead outside the winner approaching the finish and just missed. BARDOLINO , urged leaving the starting gate,
hugged the inner rail, gained a short lead in mid stretch and weakened. GREAT CAMANOE chased the pace, was four deep turning for home, challenged
for the lead near the eighth pole then gave way. SCIENCE (IRE) , well placed in mid pack early, raced outside horses in the stretch and failed to rally.
SCOTTY BROWN was no factor. MONSTER MASON lacked speed and failed to rally. MR TINGLES showed speed inside, was in the two path leaving the
turn and gave way. SMITTEN ENOUGH broke through the starting gate before the raced, showed speed outside MR TINGLES and gave way.

Footnotes
BAFFLE 'EM stalked inside a rival, eased out into the lane, moved to command in mid stretch, responded when roused and kicked clear, wandered outward
with about a sixteenth to go and prevailed. POLISH COOKIE stalked outside a rival, shifted out in upper stretch, moved up past mid stretch, altered in past
the sixteenth pole and finished gamely. BLUE MOON BUNNY , off the pace while four wide, circled into the lane and closed steadily. HOT SPICE pulled her
way clear early, dropped in and set the pace towards the rail, failed to resist a challenge in mid stretch then gave way. TILTED TIARA , fractious behind the
gate,broke sluggishly, came six wide for the drive and lacked a bid. PRAY FOR THE U S A saved ground pursuing the early pace, failed to kick on leaving
the three eighths and faded. BOAT MONEY saved ground and dropped back around the turn. An objection by the rider of POLISH COOKIE against the
winner for alleged interference in late stretch was not allowed.
