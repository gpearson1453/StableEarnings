Footnotes
IN THE GOSPEL saved ground just off the early pace, came between horses to take the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole, came under pressure
toward the quarter, ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily handled in the stretch. LET'S GET PHYSICAL raced off the pace about the three path, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, continued in the three path of the far turn and settled for second best. MASTER YOO saved ground, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and came along for third approaching mid-stretch. VIDMER'S COURAGE raced with the early
pace and took a brief lead past the half mile pole, gave chase leaving the three eighths, rounded the far turn in the three and four paths then weakened.
CHAMPAGNE JAM raced well off the pace in the three and four paths and had little response through the backstretch. THORN OF ROSE HILL settled well
off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, then showed little response through the backstretch. MR. HOSTLER rated a short lead inside, was caught
leaving the half mile pole, gave chase from that point, though, readily faded leaving the five sixteenths.

path on the turn and dug in through the stretch to take the nod the final strides. FIGAROS FORTUNE set a pressured pace, dueled clear entering the
stretch, dug in under steady encouragement through the lane but gave up the nod in the final strides. BIGAIRTOTHETHROWN pressured the early pace
inside, checked at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole, recovered stride past the quarter pole but was blocked nearing the head of the lane, though,
came back to finish evenly. ROCKING TO HOME chased and rounded the turn in the three and four paths, left the turn about the six path and finished
evenly to pass rivals. DUKE OF CORK broke a step slow then gave chase, ran in the three path of the turn, eased out leaving the turn but showed little
further. IRISH FIRE pressured the pace, contested the turn two deep between horses then weakened leaving the eighth pole. POSTED gave chase and

FIRE DOWN BELOW ran in the six path of the opening turn and settled outside into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, steadily
progressed in the five path of the far turn and dug in through the lane to take over the final yards. JAMMIN STILL settled inside on the opening turn, bid
nearing the three eighths pole but lost momentum at the heels of E J's Revenge approaching the top of the lane, slipped through at the rail leaving the
eighth pole, dueled to a brief slim lead inside the sixteenth pole but was outfinished the final yards. COMMAND THE CAT rated a slim lead inside, was met
into the backstretch and dueled from that point, raced near the rail on the far turn, drifted into the lane, was caught toward mid-stretch then outfinished for
second. E J'S REVENGE settled off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dueled to a slim brief lead
past the eighth pole, but was caught inside the sixteenth and flattened late yards. KING NEKIA rounded the first turn about the five path then rated close
into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. HOBE SOUND rounded the first turn in the six path
then rated close into the backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path of the far turn. HAN SENSE
stalked two deep and moved to even terms into the backstretch, dueled from that point and remained a solid factor two deep through the far turn, though,
