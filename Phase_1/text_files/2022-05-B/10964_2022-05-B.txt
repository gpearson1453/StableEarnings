YEARS FLY BY dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battled while saving ground around the turn, kicked clear entering the
stretch and drew off to the wire under a drive. MR. SOLO dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the
turn, could not go with the leader in the stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. KNIGHT COMMANDER trailed the field in the early going,
began a bid from the two path passing the three eighths pole, gained ground in upper stretch and flattened out from there. CAESARTHERULER hopped up
leaving the break, recovered to contest the pace on the far outside up the backstretch, continued to battle while racing four wide around the turn and
weakened in the final furlong. LUCKY LOUIE dueled between horses up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch three wide and faded
down the lane.

Footnotes
PINCH HITTER saved ground around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, turned back a rival's bid while continuing to save ground around the far
turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off to the wire. LUCKY DUDE hit the gate leaving it, raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path racing around the far turn and gained ground mildly down the lane.
PREGAME raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge while racing in the two path around the
far turn and was outkicked in the final furlong. ARISTOCAT raced in the three and four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace
between horses, angled in to save ground around the far turn and weakened on the rail in the stretch. DARE TO FAIL raced in the two path around the first
turn, came up the backstretch off the pace, continued around the far turn still in the two path and was empty from there. CONTRABANDISTA dropped back
early to trail the field from the rail around the first turn and up the backstretch, improved position slightly while racing in the two path around the far turn and
was never a threat.

down the lane to get in front late and held a late closer off in the final strides. WINZE raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn, gained ground in late stretch and split horses with a final surge to the wire to just miss. ACELA EXPRESS dueled on the outside through
the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path while racing around the turn, kicked clear in the stretch and raced gamely down the lane,
giving way in the final sixteenth of a mile. MISS ALPHA BELLA raced off the pace on the outside early, began to move up while racing in the two and three
path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. GLAMOROUS LIFE raced off the pace on the inside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the
two path and made no bid. SNAP AWAY dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the turn, and tired on the rail in the stretch.
