BAD BEAT sped clear soon after the start, set the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, held well. GOT EVEN SMARTER chased outside three to four
wide, was no match but second best. COUNT ALEXEI chased the pace in the two path, saved show. THIRSTY JUNIOR settled mid-pack, went three to five
wide on the turn, missed show honors. POPPY'S C NOTE broke a step slowly, lacked early speed, shifted in and saved ground, ran on belatedly inside. MO
GEE swung six wide into the stretch and was never near enough to threaten. GEORGIAN ROAD chased in the two to three path, tired.

Footnotes
RAP A GIFT tracked behind the leaders, bid inside but just off the rail turning for home, took a narrow lead and held rivals at bay. MIDNIGHT SPECIAL T
switched out early, went two then three wide on the turn, shifted back in once in the stretch and was gaining inside but too late. SHAMEONNATALIE set the
pace racing off the inside, went two to three wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch but lost the place. PREMEDITATED LILY stalked the leaders going three
to four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. ROYAL QUEEN swung six wide into the stretch and improved. SOUNDOFME NOTCALLN settled
mid-pack three then two wide through the turn and needed more in the stretch. JASMINE BABY saved ground on the turn then came out in upper stretch.
CAUGHT STEALING chased outside four to five wide, faded. SHE'SEVERSOCLEVER was up close briefly chasing the pace, dropped back four wide on
the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
TRUST MANDO settled in the back half of the field inside on or just off the rail early, took closer order heading to the far turn, moved out and commenced a
bid three then four wide on that bend, forged clear in the stretch. CALIBOGEE settled off the leaders in the two path early, began to advance inside on the
far turn and gained late. BESITOS CRIMINALES was urged at the break, exchanged a light brush into the first turn racing inside, moved clear and switched
off the fence going in the two then three path on the far turn, weakened. RIO CUTIE stalked two to three wide through the turns, flattened out in the drive.
CALIFORNIA TENGA was within range three wide, failed to rally. SWEET BEAU ROLL was caught four wide on the first turn, moved out further to be six
deep late on the far turn, was not a threat. LINCOLN COUNTY KID raced on or just off the rail and failed to menace. SWITCHERONIMO was not a factor
racing mostly four to five wide. AISLE RUNNER moved forward to contest the lead and exchanged a brush into the first turn going two wide on that bend,
moved out up the backstretch while dropping back, came out further from three to five wide on the far turn and was empty for the stretch.

Footnotes
B A CHAMPION set the pace in the clear racing just off the fence, was challenged in late stretch and held that rival at bay under steady handling. DOM
WAYNE tracked inside, came out three wide coming to the top of the stretch, dueled late but couldn't get past. WRAPPED stalked three wide, weakened in
the stretch. KICK IT settled well back in the two path, advanced past rivals two to three wide on the far turn but needed more in the stretch. AZTEC
EMPEROR raced four wide into the first turn, shifted in, went in the two path on the far turn and improved position some. YANO'S WAY was a bit slow into
stride, raced off the inside into the first turn, rode the rail through the far turn and improved but was not near enough to threaten. MCORO was within range
four wide, came up empty. SANTIAGO'S TOWER raced mid-pack four to five wide, faded.

SHUGS CHARLIE was caught three wide on the first turn, moved to challenge past the seven-sixteenths, went two wide on the far turn, had a narrow lead
turning for home, was headed in upper stretch but dug in gamely. RANEEM moved in from five to four wide on the first turn settling at the rear, moved up
outside foes heading up the backstretch, bid three wide taking a narrow and brief lead in upper stretch but was turned back. CLEOPATRAS CHARGE was
forwardly-positioned two wide early, in tight quarters about the seven-sixteenths, regrouped and went three to four wide on the far turn but could not kick on
in the drive. GIRONA was forced four wide into the first turn moving in three deep on that bend, steadied on heels early up the backstretch, kept on two to
three wide on the far turn but could not rally in the stretch. RAGTIME RYTHM set the pace inside, weakened. MISS IMPORTANT broke awkwardly, shifted
in, advanced inside early up the backstretch, pulled up on the far turn and walked off. FOLLOWING AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF CLEOPATRAS

Footnotes
SPICEY SECRET switched outside rivals heading into the turn, moved out further from two to four wide on that bend, dueled in mid- to late-stretch and
prevailed. SNOOZY SUZY dueled outside a rival three wide, took a narrow lead turning for home, dueled again inside a rival but was outfinished.
DOGWOOD COVE went three to four wide on the turn and gained late. RAPPERS THIEF raced two wide on the turn, came out in the stretch, ran on mildly.
CURL swung seven wide turning for home, failed to menace. JAZZY MELODY dueled inside a rival but off the fence, weakened. SWEET REGARDS shifted
off the inside, moved out further from three to six wide leaving the turn, was never a threat. KISS OF CRAN chased four wide, turned up empty. STORMIN
CHICKADEE shifted in, was not a threat. LOOKOUT FOR LANDRY was not a factor after going four to five wide on the turn.
