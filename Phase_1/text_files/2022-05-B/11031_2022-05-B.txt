Footnotes
PALACE MAGIC broke alertly, cleared and crossed over to the inside, set the pace under pressure from JERI DAWN, roused for more late on the turn,
responded willingly, turned back the bid from aforementioned rival, widened advantage under a drive then finished ridden out in the final sixteenth. JERI
DAWN applied pace pressure to PALACE MAGIC up the backstretch and into the turn, was no match for the winner in the upper stretch but sustained
steady response just off the inside and held place. DERONDA raced off the early pace then came under a ride two wide around the turn, sustained a three
wide bid through the stretch run and finished well clear over the rest. SUE HAPPY chased the top pair around the turn and faded in the lane. READY RITA
saved ground and had no response.

HERD IMMUNITY tracked the pace between rivals leaving the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, spun out approaching the head of the lane,
came under right handed pressure and shifted back in a couple paths, steadily edged up closer two wide and finished on equal terms for the win.
WYOMING CONQUEST sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, held firm around the turn, saved ground entering the upper stretch, continued with a
clear advantage a furlong out, was all out under firm handling in final stages and finished on equal terms for the win. WOKE UP IN LOVE tracked the pace
into the turn, swung five wide into the upper stretch then angled in a couple paths and sustained response to prevail for a share. RARE STRIPE raced off
the second flight midway up the backstretch, chased three wide into the upper stretch and had a mid improve. NEEDABETTERJOCK was forwardly placed
from the outset, chased in close contention around the turn then came up empty in the final furlong. DISCREET INVASION lacked speed and raced in the
back, saved ground and failed to threaten. COWORKER raced off the pace, came four wide into the upper stretch and never menaced.

ROME broke on top and set a pressured pace into the turn, shook free to a clearer lead approaching the upper stretch, came under left handed near the
furlong marker, responded, widened advantage and finished clear. ALEX'S STRIKE lacked speed and raced in the back, swung five wide into the upper
stretch, rallied along the outside and closed the gap on the winner. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK got bumped at the start, raced off the second flight up the
backstretch, went three to four wide around the turn, sustained steady response through the lane and secured a share. RED WHITE AND LOUD tracked the
pace in early stages, edged up closer racing three wide through the turn, sustained bid in the upper stretch then flattened in the final furlong. HAYDENS
HAVOC applied pace pressure to ROME in early stages, continued to force the issue around the turn then gave way in the lane. KINGSWOOD raced in
contention through early stages, continued bid around the turn then weakened. CHAPEL BARN was not too far back in the early going then failed to
advance under pressure around the turn and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
FOXY ACE bobbled slightly at the start then settled nicely while rated inside just off the early pace, raced three wide in close range around the far turn,
given cue four wide at the head of the lane, roused forward to the lead approaching the furlong marker and finished clear. C H JAY vied for the lead racing
outside of MINE MY TIME mid-way up the backstretch, continued to battle on equal terms around the final turn, was no match when the winner took control
in the upper stretch, tipped out wider, stayed on with response and finished second best. MINE MY TIME showed the way into the backstretch then dueled
for the lead going by the half mile marker, continued to battle for command with CH JAY around the far turn, failed to be a match in upper stretch but stayed
on for a share. CLIFTON PARK was allowed to settle off the early pace, launched a rail bid at the head of the lane, gained closer contention then finished
evenly. MAD AT MONEY lacked speed and trailed in the back, saved ground into the lane and passed tiring rivals. TOUGH COMPANY tracked the pace up
the backstretch, remained in range four wide around the final turn then weakened in the lane. WACO KID failed to move into contention.

passed tiring rivals. WAR RON raced near midpack, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the lane. STAGE DOOR hustled along the inside into
