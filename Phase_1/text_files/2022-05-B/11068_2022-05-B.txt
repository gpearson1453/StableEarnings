Footnotes
PABLO'S MINX raced near the inside through the turn, waited nearing the five-sixteenth pole while still inside, angled three path upper, bullied through
between leader and show rival in upper stretch, gained the lead just inside the eighth pole and widened while ridden out. JILLS PASSION raced off to a
clear lead through the turn, was challenged after straightening in the lane, no match for winner but stayed on well to be clear for the place spot. WINNING
QUALITY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was moving to the winner while in the three path in upper stretch when winner made a path
between the two, bumped with the top one a couple of times and was never a menace through the final eighth while holding the show spot.
WHERETHEMONEYWENT raced in the three path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the four path and needed more while
missing the show spot. WANNA HAVE FUN was in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from along the inside and never menaced. FABLES
LOVE AFFAIR trailed the small field while near the inside, angled into the seven path for the drive and never was a factor.

Footnotes
TREASURE OF WAR was unhurried while off the inside, guided from the two to the four path in late turn when gaining momentum, came into the lane from
the four path, shifted into the six path for clear running just inside the eighth pole and rallied to be up in time. SOUTH GEORGIA stalked the pacesetter
down the backstretch when in the three path, moved up to challenge into mid-turn, inched to the front into the lane, was moving clear soon after then was
caught by the winner late. GEORGETOWN ROAD set the pace while off the inside through the first turn, continued on the lead into the far turn, was joined
by the runner-up, dueled with that one to near the eighth pole then could not keep up while giving ground grudgingly. FEVER DREAMING tracked the pace
while along the inside down the backstretch, was asked for more nearing the half-mile pole to get nearest the leader, continued to chase the leaders through
the turn and into the lane and weakened late. TATHBEET was near the rail through the far turn and was never a factor. NILE RIVER QUEEN was in the five
to the four path through the first turn, continued in the four path through the far turn when still a contender, came into the lane from the six path and faded.
DIAMOND SURPRISE was off a step slow and spotted the field a couple of lengths, raced through the four path on the turns when near the back and was
never a threat.

Footnotes
PEEKACHICA was unrushed early, bid between foes at the three-eighths pole, fanned five wide at the quarter pole, rallied and was up in time. CLIMBER
pressed the pace in the four path, then couldn't hold off the winner. DASH OF SIMPLICITY stalked the pace inside, angled four wide at the quarter pole, bid,
then couldn't close late. SPLASH OF TONIC pressed the pace in the three path but gave way late. STORMY WAGER led in the two path before giving way
in the stretch. BERTIE THE BEAUTY stalked the pace in the four path but had no late bid. JUST HUMMING faded. REVS RUN and SAVEDBESTFORLAST
were not factors. THE THREE-QUARTER TIME IS OMITTED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.
