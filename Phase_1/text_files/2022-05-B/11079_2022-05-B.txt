Footnotes
OWEN'S LEAP stalked the early pace, moved up three wide to challenge through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and finished well to get
up under strong handling. JUSTAFEVER stalked the early going along the inside down the backstretch, shifted out five wide through the drive and got up for
the place position late. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE was away slowly, dropped back off the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and had
not enough for the top pair in the drive. TUSTLER was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced between rivals through the far turn into the stretch
and weakened the final eighth of a mile while racing three wide. BAYTOWN GET IT ON trailed the field in the early going, swung wide through the lane and
had no late rally. CHARLIE WHISKEY was sent along to set the early pace and gave way in the drive while racing near the inside.

CANDYWRAPPER CRAZY was sent along to set the early pace, was challenged near the quarter pole and responded strongly to be well clear late under
steady handling. PURCHASE POINT stalked the pace from the outside, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch, finished well but was no match
for the winner in the drive. RACEDAY ATTIRE stalked the pace, made a good bid near the quarter pole to challenge the leader but weakened the final
eighth of a mile. MONOCACY settled to the middle of the pack, raced near the inside around the far turn, was four deep near the three sixteenths pole and
no late closing run. OUTLAW QUEEN was rated down under a firm hold early and weakened in the stretch run. MAGGIE'S WILL settled off the early going,
raced six wide through the upper stretch and had no response. DOGWOODS BECCA was slow early on, swung wide through the lane and never
threatened. JAMAICAN TRAFFIC settled off the early pace and failed to respond.

MONOLOGUE stalked the pace, was patiently ridden through the far turn, swung out five wide through the upper stretch, surged late and just got up under
all out pressure. FIREMAN DAN stalked the pace, made a good four wide bid near the quarter pole, was clear at the eighth pole and was caught on the
wire. ENDLESS SUNSET settled off the early going, raced near the inside near the five sixteenths pole, angled five wide near the quarter pole and kept on
to the wire. CARILLO dropped back early on, made a six wide bid in the drive and moved up in the drive. MATH MAN was slow early on, angled five wide
through the upper lane and moved up in the drive. TAKIN RISKS was forwardly placed to lay up close while racing between rivals and weakened in the
stretch run. CHISHOLM TRAIL settled off the early pace, raced along the inside through the far turn into the stretch, checked near the eighth pole and had
no final bid. MUNDO MIX was sent along from the outside to set the early pace and gave way the final eighth of a mile. BERN N ASH raced in a bit tight at
the break, dropped back off the early pace and never was a factor. AMERICAN SMOOTH stalked the pace from the outside and failed to sustain a bid.
