Footnotes
TWIN CAUSE stalked three to two wide into the first turn, made an early bid for the lead approaching the half mile grounds, led into and around the far turn,
inched clear in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. ICE LOVE tracked from midpack four wide, ranged up outside of the leading trio around
the far turn to be within striking distance turning for home, but hung on his left lead in upper stretch, failed to keep pace with the clearing leader in the
process, then changed over approaching the final sixteenth, and secured place. PRESENCIA laid off of the pace two wide, came under urging in the three
path around the far turn, got floated out to the six path approaching the lane, then stayed on outside of foes to claim a minor share. CROOKLYN settled off
of the pace along the inside, shifted out down the backstretch, took the far turn in the five path before drifting out to the ten path entering the lane, and
moved up mildly. HOLIDAY PRINCESS stalked along the inside, was coaxed along to keep pace in the two path around the far turn, swung to the five path
turning for home, but failed to menace between horses through the lane. PATH TO VICTORY trailed three wide around the first turn, then in the six path
around the far turn, and passed tired rivals in the lane. RIDE ON BEAUTY set the pace along the inside around the first turn, met the eventual winner's bid
down the backstretch, got headed with a half mile remaining, sustained pressing position inside of that foe while under urging around the far turn, but
weakened approaching the furlong grounds. TAHAWEEL tracked three wide, inched closer entering the backstretch to press, stalked between horses
around the far turn, but faded entering the lane.

CONVERTER rated off the three-ply in the clear in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch, closed inside of the pacesetter, put a head in front near
the sixteenth pole, dueled from there and narrowly prevailed. SIR AGGRAVATOR dueled inside of two foes while racing in the two path, was headed by the
winner near the sixteenth pole, fought back outside of that foe and was gaining in the final strides to just miss. OCEAN RIDE saved ground off the pace and
was along for the show. PERSONAL MEADOW dueled between foes in the three path to midstretch and weakened. POWER (BRZ) failed to menace while
racing two wide. HEALS THE SOUL dueled outside of foes in the four path and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
SANDY DUDE stalked the leading dueling pair from the two path into the turn, shifted outside of them turning for home, sustained a grinding rally through
midstretch to bid for the lead in the final sixteenth, and edged away. EL GUAPO dueled for the lead outside of OUR NOBLE ORTEGA while a few paths
away from that foe, cleared and tucked to the two path after his counterpart faltered at the three furlong pole, maintained a clear margin into the final furlong
as a pair of rivals closed in on either side, got worn down by both of them inside the final sixteenth, but reclaimed place via a victorious head-bob. NORTH
CAUCASUS laid off of the pace inside of rivals while in the three path, required rider correction to slip inside of a weakening rival at the quarter pole, grinded
away to bid leaving the furlong grounds, vied in the entering the final sixteenth, but the rider stood up leaving the first finish line, and lost place via a
head-bob. PIYPA DE LYNDA laid off of the pace two wide, gained four wide turning for home, but flattened out in midstretch. MIDNIGHT TEQUILA raced far
back in the four path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, changed leads at the furlong grounds, and stayed on. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA dueled for
the lead along the inside, but weakened with three furlongs to go. SOULFUL SONG was outrun. MILLENNIUM CONDO stumbled at the start and lost the
rider, then was gathered by an outrider after galloping another full circuit around the track, and walked off. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START
RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
TORETTO settled in range inside, came through inside near the quarter pole, took over turning for home and drew off under a drive. HONESTO was off
slowly, angled out nearing the turn, raced four to five wide around the bend and stayed outside to gain the place. ADMIRAL TRUFFLES stalked the pace
four wide and was one-paced through the lane. ON JET HEIR pressed the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. SOVEREIGN OF SPEED set the
pace in the two path, yielded nearing the head of the lane and tired through the lane. STREET FACTS trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
LANIAKEA STORM established a clear margin entering the first turn, maintained a loose advantage around the far turn, felt a mild crop tap to his right
shoulder entering the lane as a pair of rivals took aim, willingly responded to the rider's encouragement to change leads in upper stretch, kicked on after
doing so, and held sway safely. CALI DIVINE tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and rallied to
reach place in the final sixteenth. HURRY UP DEAR settled off of the pace three to four wide around the first turn, then five wide around the far turn before
fanning six wide entering the lane, and rallied through the late stages to reach show at the wire. WHAT KNOT tracked three wide, inched closer under a
drive around the far turn, took aim on the clear leader in upper stretch, but flattened out leaving the furlong grounds, yielded, and got nailed at the wire for
show. LET FREEDOM REIN rated at the rear along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, and stayed on through the lane. UNCAPTURED GRACE
bobbled a bit at the start, stalked the clear leader from the outside, took aim on that rival entering the lane as an outer WHAT KNOT ranged up alongside,
but flopped back to her left lead leaving the furlong pole, and faltered. HOTTER THAN JULY stalked along the inside, came under urging around the far turn
to keep pace, then tired through the lane. DOMORE was pinched between horses and steadied back in the early stages, raced off of the pace two wide and
between horses, tipped three wide turning for home, and failed to factor. WHAT A KNOCKOUT saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. ENOUGH
RAIN trailed four to five wide around the first turn, then three wide around the far turn before swinging to the eight path in upper stretch, but made little
impact. PENNY ANGEL pursued in midpack three to two wide, but weakened four wide and between horses at the quarter pole.

VITAEMI stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and held clear under a drive. BION MAGIC tracked the
pace two wide, was no serious threat to the winner but won a long battle inside of SWEET PEARL for the place. SWEET PEARL bumped with TEE UP at
the start, advanced three wide around the turn, could not gain on the winner in the lane and was outfinished for the place. MAGICGIRL raced off the pace
four wide and had a mild stretch rally. BEAUTY QUEEN set the pace along the rail and gave way nearing the quarter pole. TEE UP bumped at the start,
saved ground and was through early.

Footnotes
LAKER MAMBA settled far back in the three path, inched closer while well in hand four to five wide around the far turn, produced a rally in pursuit of the
leading trio in upper stretch, and drove past those rivals in the late stages. RYE SENSE OF HUMOR laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the
first turn, inched closer four wide into the far turn, sustained a grinding charge in hopes of wearing down the top pair in the late stages, did so in the final
sixteenth, but was outkicked late. DANIEL SUN bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside while feeling pressure from an outer BIG
AND CLASSY, got headed by that foe around the far turn, but fought on gamely in upper stretch, dueled well in the final furlong, but yielded to a pair of outer
bidders in the closing stages. BIG AND CLASSY pressed the pace two wide, bid into the far turn, led in hand turning for home, dueled through midstretch as
his inner counterpart fought on and a pair of outer rivals closed in, then faltered between horses in the final sixteenth. SUN VIKING stalked three wide, but
faded between horses entering the lane. BARAHIN stalked along the inside, but faded approaching the three sixteenths pole. GOLDEN INDY tracked in the
two path around the turns, but retreated turning for home. CADET CORPS bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out
to the three path approaching the backstretch, then swung two to five wide entering the lane, but failed to factor. THE BEST DISTANCE took bumps from
rivals on either side at the start, raced far back along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn, and made little impact. SONIC KITTEN broke a
beat slowly before checking out of tight quarters between horses soon after, trailed the field, took the far turn in the four path before shifting six wide entering
the lane, but was outrun. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

THE RED MAN set the pace a bit off the rail, drew clear the quarter pole and widened under a drive. CHROME FINISH prompted the pace three wide, could
not keep pace with the winner in the lane but stayed on to hold second. LORD DARNLEY raced off the pace two wide, came five wide into the lane and was
along for the show. FEDERAL EXCHANGE pressed the winner two wide and weakened in the lane. SIXTY ONE broke in and bumped
WHISKEYONHISLIPS at the start, saved ground and never threatened. WHISKEYONHISLIPS was bumped at the start, had brief speed inside and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
REPUBLIQUE hopped a bit before bumping an outer rival at the start, pressed the pace two wide, vied into the far turn, drew clear turning for home, and
held firmly from an outer challenging foe through the final furlong. LOVE HER LOTS bobbled a bit at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, gained
four wide around the far turn to take aim on a clearing REPUBLIQUE entering the lane, but failed to progress in upper stretch, made mild progress through
the final furlong, but was safely kept at bay. BUILT DIFFERENT settled off of the pace along the inside, tipped from the three path to the four path turning for
home while tracking, reached show at the furlong grounds while failing to keep pace with the top two, and lasted for that position late. EMPRESS ELLIE took
a mild nudge from an inner foe leaving the gates, tracked two wide and from between horses early on, came under urging to keep pace in the three path
around the far turn, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on late to bid for show approaching the wire, but missed reaching that position.
RUNNING LEGACY stalked along the inside, but retreated. DEMOGORGON set the pace inside of a pressing REPUBLIQUE, sparred with that foe around
the far turn, but weakened approaching the lane. CAGUA was outrun. KEEN KINGDOM stalked three wide, but weakened between horses around the far
turn.

Footnotes
ZAMBAK settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, came six wide into the lane, closed determinedly and was up in
deep stretch. MAGNOLIA ROAD saved ground well back, advanced five wide around the far turn, took the lead in upper stretch and led until deep stretch.
BE THE ONE saved ground off the pace, moved up five wide around the far turn, came seven wide into the lane, bid in midstretch and flattened out a bit
late. SHES SKY HIGH lacked early speed while racing three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, took the lead four wide near the five-sixteenths
pole, led to upper stretch then weakened through the lane. SOUPER DUPER READY was up close inside, got shuffled back late on the far turn, angled
three wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed stretch rally. LOMBARDI AVENUE raced off the early pace four wide, bid three wide between foes
nearing the five-sixteenths pole but failed to sustain it. PRETTYASAPENNY was in range while racing two and three wide, got shuffled back late on the far
turn and offered no further bids. THE CUBAN MISSILE pressed the pace two wide and tired nearing the lane. CAPETOWN CANDY set the pace inside and
faltered nearing the lane. RACHEL DREAM trailed inside. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
