Footnotes
GRAZEN HONOR stalked the quick early pace three deep to the turn, advanced in upper stretch, caught the pacesetter leaving the furlong marker and
edged clear late. SIMPLY PERFECT broke alertly and was hustled to the early lead, set quick fractions through the turn, maintained a narrow edge leaving
the furlong marker but was caught nearing the sixteenth pole and outfinished, while besting the rest. SOMARA saved ground while unhurried in the early
going, angled out leaving the furlong marker, was outkicked by the top two in the drive but rallied in the final stages to secure third. BREAKING THE CODE
was forwardly placed early on while saving ground, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. SILVER LYRIC tracked the quick early
pace to go two wide between rivals on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and faded in the late stages. CLOCHARD STREET was away a step slowly
from the gate, lacked speed to the turn while saving ground and did not mount a late rally.

Footnotes
VRONSKY FEINT settled just off of the early pace, improved position while three wide on the second turn, advanced on the pacesetter in upper stretch,
came to even terms with HOT ROCKETTE nearing the sixteenth marker, took a slim lead into the late stages and dug in to prevail. SKY MAKER settled off
of the early pace while saving ground, was roused three wide nearing the quarter marker, tipped out a path to go four wide into the drive, found her best
stride late, came within aim in the final strides but just missed for the win while earning the nod for place. HOT ROCKETTE was sent to the front leaving the
start, set moderate fractions while well handled through the second turn, took a narrow lead into the final furlong, was confronted inside of the furlong
marker, battled against the winner's bid in the final sixteenth and relented in the end, just missing for the win and place. SHE'S SO SHINY stalked the early
pace into the first turn, saved ground along the inside while just off of the pace into the second turn, waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch,
found an opening in upper stretch but lacked a late kick in the drive. KITTYBE QUICK was allowed to settle in the early running, was steered four wide on
the second turn, was outkicked in the stretch run and did not produce a late bid. SACRED BEAUTY was up close into the first turn, attended to the
moderate pace through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in the late going.

TRINA was hustled leaving the break and set solid early fractions while being prompted by MISS SKI through the turn, extended the lead a bit leaving the
bend, came back to the runner-up in the final sixteenth but held safely in the end, did not finish the gallop out, was examined and walked off under her own
power. MISS SKI tracked the solid early pace from a two wide path, gave ground to the winner in upper stretch, was able to narrow the gap on TRINA in the
final sixteenth but was outfinished, while holding safely for second. MIA SOLINA chased the pace from a two wide path, ran evenly to the stretch, gained
ground through the final furlong but was outkicked in the end, while clear for third. STAND IN YOUR LOVE lacked early speed, trailed while two wide
nearing the quarter marker, gained ground in upper stretch but did not offer the needed late response. NAMORITA was bothered at the start and was off
slowly, saved ground while chasing the solid early pace and did not offer a late rally. RAMONCITA LIGHT chased the early pace from midpack, lost position
while three wide on the turn and weakened in the late stages.

GIRL was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
HAYDEN'S ANGEL tracked the early pace from a two wide path, overtook STEEL NERVES midway through the turn, extended the lead into upper stretch
and pulled away in the end as much the best. CIRCLE OF ROYALTY was forwardly placed in the early going, was three wide on the turn while losing
ground, was outkicked and no match for the winner in the stretch run but kept on to be best of the rest. QUITCHERSNIVELIN hopped at the start and was
away slowly, lacked early speed, improved position in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals in the drive to be clear for third. FIRST TIME PLAYER was up
close into the turn, lost ground while four wide nearing the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. JEANIE'S SWAN chased the early fractions from the
second flight, improved position while two wide on the turn but did not threaten in the late going. KID IN THE FOREST was void of early speed, was steered
three wide along the second turn and was not a factor. DONA FLAMA chased the early pace, lost ground on the turn while along the inside, and did not
make an impact. STEEL NERVES was hard sent leaving the break, came under pressure from the winner midway through the turn, lost position in upper
stretch and stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RUNKERRY was sent leaving the break and set solid early fractions while being prompted through the turn, came under pressure nearing the furlong
marker, was kept to steady encouragement while repelling the bid from MURPHYS TIGER and held on in the end over the closing runner-up.
SONOFAFINCH settled off of the early speed while outside of rivals, was roused four wide into the drive, made a good late rally and could not reel in the
winner in the end but was up in time to get the nod for second. MURPHYS TIGER was up close in the run to the turn, advanced on the inside nearing the
quarter marker, continued that bid to the furlong grounds, was outfinished in the final sixteenth and was just edged out in the end for the place. OUR BOLD
PRINCE chased the early pace, was in tight entering the turn, checked off of heels midway through the turn and dropped back, re-rallied in the stretch run
but could not make an impact on the top three. STORMY CHARMANT chased the early pace, held position while three wide on the turn, lost ground leaving
the bend and weakened in the drive. EXHORTATION was off a bit slowly, was void of early speed to the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker,
lacked room at the top of the stretch, angled out leaving the furlong marker and did not mount a late rally. COMMAND A PREMIUM took back to track the
solid early pace, lost ground on the turn and into upper stretch and gave way in the final stages.

IN OUR A was away sharply from the gate and edged to an early clear lead, felt pressure nearing the quarter marker and repelled that effort to again edge
clear nearing the furlong grounds, was confronted in the final sixteenth and determinedly held sway to prevail. HEY MATE tracked the pace to the turn,
advanced on the pacesetter approaching the quarter marker, was set down for the drive and was able to gain a bit of ground on the winner in the end but
was outfinished while holding for second in a blanket finish for the minor awards. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD stalked the moderate pace, lost position in upper
stretch, came back on in the stretch to close in the final furlong and just missed for second while earning the nod for third. TORPEDO AWAY chased the
early pace, was two wide through the turn, improved position in upper stretch while mounting a steady bid and continued that run through the final stages,
just missing for the minor awards. CLEM LABINE was unhurried in the early stages, lost position on the turn, swung widest to be seven wide at the
three-sixteenths marker, closed willingly in the final stages and just missed for second and third. TRUTH SEEKER lacked early speed, was roused four to
five wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in the drive and just missed for the minor awards. KIWI'S DREAM (AUS) chased the pace four wide
through the turn, lost position in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. UNION DANCE chased the moderate pace from the inside through the turn and gave
way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CECILE'S CHAPTER settled in the midflight while saving ground, came three wide nearing the quarter pole, advanced in upper stretch, continued that run in
the final sixteenth and reeled in the top pair in the final strides to secure the win. STARSHIP ENDEAVOR was squeezed a bit at the start, was keen early
while contesting the solid opening pace, advanced on AWESOME AMANDA leaving the second turn, dueled with that foe through the final furlong, drifted
out in the late stages and was tagged in the final strides by the winner, while holding for second. AWESOME AMANDA was sent leaving the break, set
contested fractions while being prompted by STARSHIP ENDEAVOR to the quarter marker, was headed by that foe and dueled through the final furlong
and was caught in the final strides by the winner, while just being edged for second. LORETTA was forwardly placed, was two to three wide on the first turn,
stayed within aim of the leading pair along the second turn, rallied in midstretch, steadied inside of the sixteenth marker while lacking room and was
outfinished in the end. FABRIANA settled in the midflight while two wide, angled out leaving the second turn and finished evenly in the stretch run.
GRIGORO was allowed to settle, was three wide on the first turn, improved position on the second turn while four wide, swung widest into the drive to be six
wide nearing the three-sixteenths marker, offered a mild late gain but was not a factor. CARASYNTHIA bobbled at the start and was off a bit slowly, was
unhurried through the early stages, improved position on the second turn and into upper stretch but did not threaten in the late going. BLUSHING BAY
settled off of the solid early pace, lost position along the backstretch run and into the second turn and did not produce a late bid.
