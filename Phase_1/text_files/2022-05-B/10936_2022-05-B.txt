Footnotes
CADILLAC CANDY broke well, but was outsprinted by an outer rival early on, tracked from midpack, inched closer in the three path into turn in pursuit of the
top pair, floated to the five path entering the lane while ranging up, chased a clearing SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) through midstretch, grinded away on that foe's
margin the final furlong, menaced in the final sixteenth, and just gained an advantage at the wire via a tight photo finish. SEISMIC SPIRIT (IRE) sprinted
clear early on, showed the way from his pressing outer stablemate around the turn, met that foe's bid entering the lane, shook free of him in upper stretch,
held sway while managing a clear margin through midstretch, but met CADILLAC CANDY's challenge in the final sixteenth, and got nailed at the wire.
ROMAN GIANT hopped slightly at the start, stalked the top pair from the inside around the turn, came into the lane in the three path, but failed to progress
on the leader's advantage, got outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, kept on to bid for show inside of a tiring foe in the final sixteenth, gained that
position soon after, and desperately held it to the wire. REASON'S LEGACY was void of early speed, laid off of the pace in the four path around the turn,
wandered about in upper stretch while trying to pick up stride, then stayed on well in the late stages, but missed reaching show. STARSTRIKER (GB)
veered outwardly at the start, recovered soon after and rushed to press his pace-setting stable-mate into the turn, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole,
drifted to the four path entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with his inner counterpart in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead approaching the
furlong grounds, and weakened between horses. ISLAND SWAGGER saved ground far off of the pace, but was outrun. HEZMORETHANREADY settled off
of the pace in the two to three path around the turn, but made little impact.

Footnotes
KEEN HEIR raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, stayed on through the lane in pursuit of a leading OILER while hanging on his left lead,
ranged up to that foe entering the final sixteenth, and edged an advantage approaching the wire. OILER pressed the leader from the outside, bid
approaching the five sixteenths pole, led in upper stretch, inched away at the furlong grounds, but failed to kick on, met KEEN HEIR's challenge at the
sixteenth pole, and was worn down late. OX DOC bumped an inner foe at the start while breaking on top, set the pace from a prompting OILER into the turn,
got headed by that foe at the quarter pole, greenly resented being asked to change leads in upper stretch while fighting on, but gave way approaching the
final sixteenth. GO VIRTUAL took a bump from an outer rival at the start, chased the top pair from the two to three path around the turn, but faded through
the lane. SILVESTRE veered outwardly at the start, trailed the field in the five path around the turn, and showed little.

Footnotes
PARLANCE stalked the top from the outside, ranged up to them entering the lane to bid passing the quarter pole, gained an advantage in upper stretch, and
drew off through the final furlong. CHI TOWN LADY was tough to load, then was slow into stride between horses out of the gate, lagged well behind the field
in the three path around the turn, cut the cap while tipping to the six path entering the lane, and rallied outside of foes in the final furlong to reach place late.
MUTED vied for the lead two wide, led entering the lane as an outer PARLANCE menaced, got headed by that rival in upper stretch, gave way leaving the
furlong grounds, but saved show. LET'S BE CLEAR tracked from the two to three path around the turn, shifted outside of the leading trio entering the lane,
but was only one-paced, chased in hopes of bidding for minor placings in the late stages, but was outkicked by an outer rival before failing to reach a tiring
foe for show. PINKY TOE set the pace inside of a vying MUTED, got headed entering the lane as another rival ranged up, and weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICA'S PRIDE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair approaching the three furlong pole, loomed large while ranging up entering the
lane, sparked a duel with GIN N SIN in upper stretch, gained an advantage in midstretch, and edged away in the late stages. GIN N SIN set the pace inside
of a vying rival, shook free of that foe at the quarter pole while AMERICA'S PRIDE menaced, dueled with that foe in upper stretch, but was headed at the
furlong grounds, and gave way late, but safely held place. MCMANSION bobbled slightly before shying from an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace
along the inside, improved inside of foes around the turn, tipped out to the four path while pursuing the top trio entering the lane, and chased evenly
thereafter. JEWELOFAKID trailed, tucked from the four to two path at the three furlong pole, then moved up in the lane while hanging on his left lead.
YELLOW CREEK ROAD vied for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses entering the lane. SWEET BEAUTY pressed four wide, stalked outside
of rivals around the turn, then faded entering the lane. M M M MY SHAROANA prompted the pace three wide and between horses, but checked
approaching the three furlong pole when the eventual winner shifted across her path, and faltered soon after. BUMPER GIRL raced off of the pace in the
three path, and was done early.
