TOOTIE chased the leader from the inside, continued to bid on the turn, dug in gamely mid stretch and surged to the wire to prevail. DIAMONDS N ACES
chased the leader while three wide into the turn, made a gamely rally in the stretch drive and was just up for second. EAGLE EXPRESS raced behind the
leader while four wide, was in a hard drive entering the stretch and hung for third in the end. TURN ON THE BLING was unhurried early, then rallied five
wide at the top of the stretch and was closing well in the end. MYSTERIOUS STAR set the pace two off the rail, cleared the turn, but gave way in the stretch
drive. ITS A GEE THING was in close early then settled back two wide and failed to fire.

Footnotes
SEDUCTIVE U S A was unhurried early, racing along the rail, then angled out at the quarter pole, closing fast and drawing off from the field to win easily.
ENGLANDER pressed the pace, going two wide, dueled for the lead around the turn, briefly gaining command down the lane, but was out run late. BUBBA
BLING stalked the pace, racing three wide, then offered a mild bid in the stretch drive to hold on for show. IMPLICATOR had no early foot, traveling along
the rail, then angled out at the quarter pole, with a mild rally, too late. GOLD MONEY made the lead early, dueling through the turn and gave way in the
stretch. UNRESTRICTED was near the back, going three wide and showed little.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MADE was near the back, racing down the backstretch, circled the field, going three wide, and closed with a rush, running down
HELLUVALIFE, to just get up for the win. HELLUVA LIFE was mid pack, angled out a bit in the turn, and rallied, three wide, while moving into the lead in
mid stretch, but was unable to fight off the winner. TENOR made the lead out of the gate, while being pressed from the outside, then faltered mid stretch
and held on for show. KING JINGALING pressed the pace early on, two wide, then dropped back in the turn. JAMES'S MOONSHINE had no early foot,
angling out in the turn, but failed to fire. SPEED EFFECT stalked the pace, three wide, made a mild bid turn, and faded in mid stretch. SCHOENHARDT was
mid field early, along the rail and dropped back after a half.

Footnotes
BLACKROCK CASTLE was in a steady drive four wide down the backstretch then rallied at the top of the stretch, dueled with an inside rival and was just up
for the win. MORE LIKE IT chased the pace from the inside into the far turn, had to steady slightly, then dueled with an outside rival down the stretch and
just missed. GORDON ANTHONY chased the pace while three wide, then continued to race evenly throughout the far turn, made a mild bid in the stretch
and was closing well in the end. EASTER SNAP broke out and brushed rival at the start, then chased the pace four wide, was in tight then squeezed back
on the far turn, continued to bid in the stretch drive but was no threat. SEATTLE SOUL stumbled at the start then was unhurried early, bid five wide around
the far turn but was no factor. DECLARE WAR settled along the rail and failed to menace. NOT NECESSARILY was brushed at the start, then was quick to
set the pace down the backstretch, was in clear on the far turn but faltered in the final furlongs.
