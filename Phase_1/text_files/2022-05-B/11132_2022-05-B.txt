through the far turn, was seven wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. KEEPINMYPROMISE dueled for the early lead and weakened
late. UNLIMITEDDATAPLAN was coaxed along early, raced in tight quarters near the three eighths pole, was shuffled back, race two wide in the drive and
never threatened. MISS MONIQUE settled off the early going, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally. ONEFINEDAY vied for the
early lead between rivals and tired.

Footnotes
STONUS MAXIMUS showed good early speed and held gamely in the drive under strong handling. MAYHEM AND CHAOS stalked the pace, raced along
the inside near the quarter pole and got up for the place position late. ATTORNEY LOUIS was forwardly paced to lay up close early on, raced two to three
wide in the drive and kept on. LOVE THAT KID stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide and had no final winning bid. LUCKY CHAMP settled off
the early pace, raced near the rail in the drive and had no rally. GURKHA RIFLES raced evenly and had no rally. ATLATL dropped back early and failed to
respond. ELTONSINGSTHEBLUES failed to sustain a bid. BAT MAN'S BULL raced far back and never threatened.
