Footnotes
COSMO away quickly in the beginning then dropped back off the pace, raced between runners and got had to pause when running up on rivals heels early,
tipped three wide on the turn, rallied from outside and reached the front in midstretch, cleared and drifted in late and won going away. HEARTBREAKER
broke a bit slow then sped to the front from inside, vied with rivals into the stretch, held a short lead into the final furlong, relinquished the lead in midstretch
and stayed on to secure second. BALADI stalked outside rivals early on, bid four then three wide on the turn, challenged into the furlong grounds and could
not find more in deep stretch. CONSTANT CONFLICT pressed the pace from outside, lost contact briefly before challenging again the two path, traveled
between runners leaving the turn and faltered in the final furlong. CHERUBIC FACTOR tracked on the inside, waited for room behind the leader around the
bend, roused in upper stretch but never found room through the final furlong. SANTOS TO WILSON stalked the top pair off the inside, went three wide into
the turn, got put in tight briefly past the five-sixteenths pole, moved into the two path and weakened down the lane. HAND-TIMED.

CHEENA set the pace on the inside, held a short lead through the turn, overtaken by the winner nearing the furlong grounds and held the place. HALF
NELSON broke a bit slow, stalked from inside through the turn, got put in a bit tight at the top of the stretch, kept on willingly then got crowded again by
SMOKIN CHEENA midstretch and once more late halting his momentum. FUNKHOUSER pressed from outside into and around the turn and weakened
down the lane. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE was off a bit slow in the beginning, chased four wide into the turn, climbed around the bend and angled down to
the two path and could not rall when straightened away in the lane. PAPPY'S GIRL broke slow from outside, raced at the back widest of all, entered the turn
five wide, angled to the rail around the bend and had little left for the stretch run.

INCH forced to check when LITTLE MISCHIEF shifted in early the jumped crossing back onto the turn, trailed outside a rival leaving the backstretch, got
bothered by that rival into the turn, angled out and ranged up for wide, took over under hand urging in upper stretch and widened to the wire. MAJESTIC
WIND bumped with LITTLE MISCHIEF crossing over the dirt, took control after then moved inside, showed the way into the stretch, was no match for the
winner in upper stretch and stayed on to best the rest. LITTLE MISCHIEF broke well then shifted in crossing the dirt, bumped with MAJESTIC WIND shortly
after then pulled the rider along, got taken back and chased the top trio from inside into the turn, remained inside to the stretch and was along for the show.
LIKE THE WIND stumbled badly in the beginning, steered to the outside and went up to attend the pace alongside the top pair, bid three deep around the
turn and weakened in the lane. LIL LIGHT HEADED stumbled leaving the gate, chased early then went up to press the pace from between rivals into and
around the turn and also weakened in the stretch.

pole, lost touch leaving the bend and churned on to hold second. DON'T TALK stumbled leaving the gate, went up to apply pressure form outside then three
deep past the half-mile pole, lost touch with the top pair with a quarter mile left to run and weakened down the lane. NO LIMITATION trailed two to three

Footnotes
JOHNNY PODRES shifted out at the start but was quickly corrected, set the pace from the rail with STOTLAND to the outside, maintained a short lead
through the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew away. EXPLOSIVE stalked the pace in the three path early, continued three wide into the stretch
and outfinished STOTLAND for the place honors. STOTLAND brushed leaving the gate, raced up close outside the pacesetter, kept the pressure on
through the far turn, could not keep up with the winner in upper stretch and got edged for second. WILLY THE COBBLER brushed inner rival leaving the
gate, coaxed early and moved inside chasing the frontrunner into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and never responded to urging. MR. T'S THIRSTY
reserved in the two path early on, remained two wide into the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
BEST OF SHOW was prominent early from the rail then dropped back a bit to a stalking position, bid between at the four furlong marker, cleared with a
quarter mile left to run, met the bid from ZAHRA at the eighth pole, battled through the furlong grounds and held gamely. ZAHRA had early speed three
deep on the first turn, ceded the lead late on the bend, bid four deep leaving the backstretch, could not keep up around the far turn, angled in and re-bid
inside BEST OF SHOW with a furlong left to run, dueled in the final sixteenth and could not get by. ZABAVA forwardly placed early four deep into the first
turn then took a stalking position around the bend, traveled widest up the backstretch, lost ground around the far turn while four wide and was along for the
show. WARREN'S MEMORABLE showed speed in the two path around the first turn, took over at the five-eighths marker, cleared briefly before being
confronted at the half-mile pole, lost command midway around the far turn, weakened in the lane and got edged for third. HEART RIVER trailed three then
two wide around the first turn, angled to the rail on the far turn and could not rally. DISCRETE STEVIE B vied five deep on the first turn then took control and
angled into the three path late on the bend, lost command at the five-eighths pole, chased the leader between rivals at the half-mile pole, dropped back
around the far turn and tired.

ROCKING REDHEAD sped clear and controlled the pace on the inside in hand, showed the way while saving ground into the stretch, put to right-handed
urging with a furlong to go and kicked away from the runner-up. FREEDOM FLYER stalked the leader in the two path, took aim two wide entering the stretch
but was turned away in the furlong grounds. NEW HEAT was off a bit slow to begin, settled on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, angled out in the lane
and gained the show. COUNTERPARTY RISK (IRE) tracked three wide through both turns, lacked a bid in the stretch and was overtaken for the show.
VELVET SLIPPERS hopped then stumbled and lost the rider at the start, caught by the outrider past the finish line and walked off. THE STEWARDS
REVIEWED THE START OF VELVET SLIPPERS AND RULED SHE CAUSED HER OWN PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A
STARTER.

THRIVE broke a step slow then went up to take control from inside, kicked clear from PERECTO AMOR entering the stretch and held well under left-handed
urging and steady handling. PRINCE MAGICIAN got bumped leaving the gate, tracked three wide around both turns, shifted in and bumped PERFECTO
AMORE in upper stretch, drifted inward in the final furlong and. DIVINE FEMININE broke out and bumped rival, stalked two wide into the clubhouse turn
then moved to the rail, traveled a bit off the rail into the stretch and finished willingly for the show. PERFECTO AMOR away quickly then pressed the pace
from outside, chased up the backstretch before applying pressure once again, lost touch with the winner into the lane, bumped with PRINCE MAGICIAN in
upper stretch and weakened. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE INCIDENT IN UPPER STRETCH AND RULED THAT BOTH PERFECTO AMOR AND
PRINCE MAGICIAN BOTH CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR PROBLEMS AND PERFECTO AMOR WAS NOT COST A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
LEGGS GALORE away quickly to take the front, set the pace outside HEAR MY PRAYER, cleared that rival at the half-mile pole and held well under
left-handed encouragement and steady handling. BYE BYE BERTIE sat off the pace early on, angled in for the turn then had her path taken by ROYAL
ADDRESS (IRE) entering the bend, tipped out and came three wide into the stretch, put in a late bid and gained second. ROYAL ADDRESS (IRE) stalked
off the rail, angled in entering the turn, came three wide into the stretch and got edged for the place. BELLA D trailed early on, raced two wide early on the
turn then angled out and came seven wide into stretch and passed tired rivals. HEAR MY PRAYER pressed the pace from inside early, could not keep up
with the winner past the half-mile pole and weakened in the stretch run. STELLA NOIR broke a bit slow, tugged briefly while moving to a forward position,
went three wide into the turn, chased six wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
HURRICANE CLOUD (GB) broke a step slow, pulled on the first turn and was tossing his head early on the backstretch, moved out and advanced four wide
in middle stages, bid three deep into the far turn, took over with a furlong to go, put away COAST OF ROAN while drifting out and drew away. COAST OF
ROAN bumped with outside rival at the start, cleared and crossed over to the inside, took pressured entering the far turn, held a short lead to the stretch,
overtaken with a furlong to go and kept on for a clear second. BORDER TOWN reserved inside early, pulled and steadied on the first turn, tugged forward
and had to check off heels near the half-mile pole, angled out on the second bend and came three wide into the stretch, tipped out further at the top of the
lane and bested the rest. COMRADERY (IRE) chased between rivals and got put in tight and steadied early, urged two then three wide on the far turn and
could not find the needed late kick. CITY RAGE broke a bit slow, steadied off heels early, went three then two wide around the first turn, closest in pursuit up
the backstretch, put in a mild bid between rivals at the three-eighths pole but could not keep up with the top pair around that bend, chased two wide into the
drive and weakened. ENCODER chased four deep into the first turn moved in a bit to race three deep, continued outside rivals and went three to four wide
into the stretch and weakened. OVERDUE bumped leaving the gate, reserved in the early going and took the first turn three wide, traveled four wide into the
second bend, angled in and raced two wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact. GUILDSMAN (FR) pulled and became rank on the inside early,
continued under a hold up the backstretch, saved ground to the lane and failed to respond.
