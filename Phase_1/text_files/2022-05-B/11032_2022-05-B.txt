striking position three wide through the turn, bid, then drifted in and weakened. BENCH WALK allowd to settle inside, angled out four wide through the
second turn, fanned widest into the stretch and improved position. SEA CAPTAIN set the pace off the rail, angled in into the turn, then faded into the stretch.

ANOTHER BREEZE allowed to settle, moved up on the two path through the turn, came through on that path, then angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and drew off late. MIDNIGHT PUNK chased the early pace, held position on the two path through the turn, angled in and came through inside,
gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. SAVE THE DRAMA allowed to settle, moved up
three and four wide through the turn, fanned widest into the stretch and flattened the final furlong. TOTAL DISTRACTION well placed, held position two and
three wide through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and weakened. SAMURAI LEGACY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased his
lead through the turn, then was challenged the final furlong and weakened. MARSAC ran evenly for a half while saving ground, then faded through the lane.

ONE TIMER hopped at the start, was sent to a clear lead, increased his margin through the turn, then drifted out and drew off in the stretch and was ridden
out. CIRCLE BACK JACK never far back, moved up into the turn outside, held that position three wide through the turn, bid on that path, then could not
threaten the winner and held the place safe. ZOOMBIE unhurried in the early going, saved ground on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path into the lane, then flattened the final furlong and held the show. ALL IN SYNC allowed to settle, moved up three and four wide through the turn, fanned
widest into the lane and passed a tiring rival. BAYTOWN FROSTY led before the first call, saved ground and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
SQUIRREL sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, turned back a bid into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. SUMMER
PALACE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled four wide into the stretch, made a steady gain and closed for the place. KICKS ON SIXTY
SIX well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid outside the leader into the stretch, then could not match strides
with that one, weakened late and held the show. JINGLE BELLS allowed to settle, gained position on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path and had a mild late gain. KIANG was a brief factor, outside. WILD ENOUGH allowed to settle, gained position three wide through the turn, came four
wide into the stretch and faded. GET ALONG tracked the pace and faded through the turn.
