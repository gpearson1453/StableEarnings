Footnotes
GHAALEB'S CITY broke on top, soon shared the lead inside JUST A WONDER, did not stay with that one after a furlong and a half, angled outside with
four furlongs left, went for the lead on the bend, moved clear under urging upper stretch and kept GHAALEB'S RANGER at bay under steady handling.
GHAALEB'S RANGER chased from outside, began to angle in after two furlongs, saved ground taking the turn, altered out three wide upper stretch, was all
out, came up short but proved easily second best. JUST A WONDER moved up quickly from between rivals to share the lead from outside, drew clear after
a furlong and a half, was challenged from outside on the bend and flattened out along the rail for the stretch run. MAJESTIC RAJ a brief contender from
inside, was steadied when her path narrowed into the turn, continued along the rail and gradually faded.

Footnotes
QUIET DRAMA moved up between rivals, angled out at the half mile pole for a clear path, advanced four wide on the bend, rallied under steady urging and
got up in time. PRETTY GITA forwardly placed from outside, was three wide taking the turn, closed well from between rivals the final furlong but was
outfinished in a game effort. FILLY FROM ILLY vied for the lead outside BOBBIE TOO TOO from the early going, was all out between horses the last eighth
and also outfinished in a game try. BOBBIE TOO TOO disputed the pace from inside, edged ahead in the lane but slowly wore down through the waning
yards. MEXIA without early speed from outside, lost considerable ground widest through the turn then rallied belatedly six wide the final furlong. SIMPLY
FAST also void of early speed, raced just inside MEXIA , also lost ground taking the bend and found best stride too late deep stretch.
THEYCALLHERPINKY chased from just off the inside, lodged her bid in the stretch and found herself boxed in behind the leaders nearing the wire. AKA
LIONESS was a contender from inside on the backstretch but gradually yielded once on the bend.

Footnotes
LADY MAGNA rated between horses on the backstretch, progressed two wide on the bend, swung out leaving the turn, rallied under steady urging in the
stretch and got up in the final strides. MIZ CLIPPER vied for the lead between rivals from the early going, did not keep up two wide on the turn, came again
in the lane, edged ahead nearing the sixteenth marker but was outfinished in a game effort. DEAUVILLE MIST disputed the pace just off the rail but inside
horses, floated out some taking the turn, moved ahead from path three upper stretch, battled between foes the final furlong but did not have enough left.
ARCH FLYER broke well but quickly dropped back, picked up her pace just off the inside on the bend, lost ground fanning seven wide for a clear path
entering the stretch, surged the last eighth but was too late. HALO COUTURE pressed from inside but weakened for the drive. GHAALEB'S SICILIAN was
an early factor toward the outside, failed to keep up widest through the turn and could only make up minor ground the final eighth. RUBY ROUND HERE
helped prompt the pace from between rivals, was four to five wide taking the bend then flattened out for the drive. MY WIFE IS BOSS a bit awkward at the
break, steadily progressed from outside to edge ahead just outside DEAUVILLE MIST but gave way from between foes in the lane.

Footnotes
MON AMI FUZZIE void of speed, though urged along in the early going, picked up his pace under a drive from just off the rail on the bend, angled out to the
middle of the track at the top of the lane, was all out and got up in time. TONYS MORNING LINE pressed the early speed from just outside, went for the
lead two wide on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch, drifted out some under left-handed pressure just inside the eighth pole, was corrected, lengthened
command but was outfinished in a game effort. MAC PANDOWDY forwardly placed from inside, angled out four wide for racing room on the bend, had
every chance between rivals in the stretch, ran evenly the final furlong but caught CARNAVAL CONQUEST for third. CARNAVAL CONQUEST helped
prompt the pace outside TONYS MORING LINE, was three wide on the turn, angled in some entering the lane, altered his path twice trying to stay clear of
the latter, began to wear down deep stretch but was easily best of the others. GHAALEB'S DOMAIN broke alertly, soon had the inside, was challenged on
the turn and gave way for the drive. RODEO MAN chased from outside, improved position three wide on the bend, fanned out some for the stretch run and
had little to offer. CYCLONE ATTACK chased from just off or along the rail and failed to menace.

Footnotes
LEMON BLITZ rated from outside, commenced his bid four wide on the second turn, rallied under steady urging in the lane, took a narrow advantage with
seventy yards to go and held sway. DRAW THE LINE settled at the back, picked up his pace as he swung out into the second bend, lost ground fanning
outside LEMON BLITZ entering the lane, closed well, came up short but got up for second nearing the wire. CAMPAIGN SPY was kept close toward the
outside, took over the lead three wide on the second turn, battled between rivals to hold on in the stretch but did not have enough left in the waning yards.
JOEY B progressed between horses to vie for the lead two wide on the second turn, fought through upper stretch but began to wear down inside the final
furlong. BEL BIMBO in contention briefly, did not keep up from inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground through the second bend and only
passed tired ones in the lane. ZARMAE pressed KAY'S GRAY from just outside but began to fade with three furlongs to go. TOCCETIVE JAC a step slow at
the break, was hustled along in the early going, stayed off the inside and had no late bid. KAY'S GRAY broke alertly, soon had a clear lead and the inside
but gave way before finishing six furlongs.

TIZ APPROVED broke alertly, was rated between horses in the early going, roused leaving the quarter pole, floated out to path three entering the lane,
moved clear, began to drift out as he wore down the final sixteenth but held off GIRLOLAMO'GLORY under steady handling. GIRLOLAMO'GLORY in
midpack early, picked up his pace three wide on the turn, swung out to path five for the stretch run, took over second inside the last eighth, closed well but
was too late. KITCHEN FIRE prominent between rivals, vied for the lead just outside TIZ APPROVED on the bend but slowly yielded in the lane. TRY TRY
AGAIN soon trailed, was just off the inside taking the turn then showed a willingness to run late between rivals. FRONTANA chased from outside, lost
ground four to six wide through the bend then also showed a willingness to run the last eighth. SIRCORRI chased from just off the inside, came into
contention on the turn but could not sustain his bid in the stretch. MARCO'S DREAM displayed early speed from inside but began to faded after three
furlongs.

Footnotes
W W RUSSIAN GOLD rated off the early speed, was roused into the bend, progressed three wide, found himself boxed in upper stretch, altered out some
for a clear path, bumped STOSH, rallied between rivals and took a narrow advantage with seventy yards left. STOSH chased from outside, lost ground five
wide through the turn, was bumped and forced out some upper stretch, rallied beside W W RUSSIAN GOLD but lacked the extra needed in the waning
yards. READY REDDING steadily advanced from outside to vie for the lead four wide on the turn, edged ahead upper stretch but did not have enough left
inside the final sixteenth. CACHACO prominent from inside, was caught in tight quarters and jostled with RAHFEE TOWN from the nine-sixteenths pole to
the half mile marker, was steadied at that point, remained on the rail taking the turn, altered out upper stretch, was blocked with a furlong to go, altered
inside when a path opened inside the final sixteenth and closed belatedly. CROWNED LEADER appeared to swipe the gate as he broke inward, was void of
speed, though urged along, lost considerable ground widest through the bend but surged the last eighth from the middle of the track. WILD WES raced in
the second flight from outside, bid for the lead three wide on the turn, fought to hold on in the stretch but wore down the final furlong. RAHFEE TOWN
prominent between rivals, altered in some trying to keep a clear path inside IT'S BELLAMY TIME midway on the backstretch, jostled with CACHACO to the
half mile marker, was altered out at that point, caught in tight between the latter and WILD WES as he tried for the lead near the quarter pole and began to
yield in the lane. IT'S BELLAMY TIME took the early lead and steadily angled in, was challenged from outside on the bend and gave way the final
three-sixteenths.
