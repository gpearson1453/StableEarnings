THETRASHMANSCOMING was back off the leaders three or four wide, rallied in the lane and gained the show. MATRICULATE was four wide to the far
turn, moved in through that bend but had no rally. EL DIABLO GRANDE forced the pace outside SWINGIN' SAM to late in the far turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
CARIOCA was on the pace inside rivals to bid clear into the lane and edged away under steady handling. RUN FOR MATTY dropped back early, rallied
three and four wide in the far turn and continued on to gain the place. HELLO HEARTBREAKER moved up four wide to bid into the far turn but could not
sustain the run. WAR REPORTER followed the pace four wide and had no rally. OUR HALF FIRST was not a threat. PURE CRYSTAL contested the early
lead three wide and weakened. BOLD IMPACT followed the pace four wide and weakened. R DEJA VOO saved ground and tired. Photo finish estimated by
Equibase chartcaller.
