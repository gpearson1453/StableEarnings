could not catch the winner. P R GIRLFRIEND prompted the pace outside the winner to the far turn and weakened. MISS JUSTICE reared at the break and
was always back four wide. TEA AT NOON saved ground and was outrun.

Footnotes
MY TRUE REWARD tracked the leaders four wide early to bid into the far turn, edged clear turning for home and kept a safe margin under steady handling.
THREE BALL contested the pace outside WOKE UP WILD to the far turn then could not handle the winner in the drive. NEXTPORTOFCALL saved ground
in reach of the leaders, angled four wide into the lane and rallied to finish on even terms with WOKE UP WILD for the show. WOKE UP WILD gained the
lead about the two path in the first turn, continued to the far turn and came up empty nearing the lane to finish on even terms with NEXTPORTOFCALL for
the show. JIMMIE T was not a factor. ISLAND SUN saved ground and tired.

ALWAYS A TIZ moved to a clear lead about the two or three path and made all the running, came out a bit into the far turn, carried the lead into the lane
and just held late. REMARKABLE CHARM settled back off the pace three wide, rallied going to the far turn, angled out into the lane and closed late to just
miss. MOONFIELD stalked the winner's pace three wide, moved to challenge into the far turn as that one came out a bit, continued in reach but was
outfinished for position late. The rider of MOONFIELD lodged a claim of foul alleging interference against the winner into the far turn which was not allowed.
DONNAS FINAL WORD was in reach of the pace along the inside and weakened. NEBRASKA RED was not a factor four wide.
