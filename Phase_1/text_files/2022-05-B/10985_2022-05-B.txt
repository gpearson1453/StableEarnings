Footnotes
ROUSING SIREN tracked the leader inside of IRINA'S HERO through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was pushed along into the far turn,
bid two wide, engaged outside of KING ZION in earnest near the five sixteenths, loomed under a drive two wide into the lane, led near the three sixteenths
and drove clear. KING ZION was placed on the pace and soon cleared, saved ground around the far turn, was engaged by ROUSING SIREN near the five
sixteenths, was driven in upper stretch inside of that foe, was headed by ROUSING SIREN near the three sixteenths, and chased on second best from
there. TEA AFTER BALLET raced two wide near the rear around the first turn, was relegated to the rear past the five eighths as TEQUILA REVOLUTION
advanced slightly in front of him, raced in the three path at the rear of the main group around the far turn, swung into the lane in the five path, and prove no
match under a drive. TEQUILA REVOLUTION broke a step slowly, raced three wide into the first turn, was taken to the rear, raced a bit keenly while
restrained at the rear into the backstretch, inched forward to second last past the five eighths inside of TEA AFTER BALLET, raced in the two path at the
rear of the main group around the far turn, was driven in the three path in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. IRINA'S HERO tracked the pace two
wide through the clubhouse turn and down the back straight, was urged past the half, faded in the four to five path around the far turn and was allowed to
trail home.

SWEET BLINDNESS was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and made a bid leaving the turn, then drew clear in the final furlong to
prove best under a drive. GRAND PRIZE set the pace on the inside and proved to be no match for the winner late while clearly second best. LEA RO was
well placed early and then fell back leaving the turn and then came again late to gain the show award. LAUNCH AWAY was allowed to settle early and
advanced on the inside, shifted out three wide for the drive and then was empty. SILVERA was rated early three wide and tired. The mile fraction was hand
timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
TALKTOEACHOTHER sent for speed and cleared, continued uncontested in the two path on the turn, and gradually increased his advantage under a mild
drive in the two to three path on the lane. ALPINE GHOST was asked for speed early, tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the
turn, was driven in the three to four path in upper stretch, and chased on willingly while no match for the leader. DARE GOES DA DEVIL settled at the rear
of the main group, raced patiently in the two to three path on the turn, swung into the lane in the six path and kept on mildly for the show. IRISH TUFF
settled near the rear early, joined inside of CAPTAIN CARNEGIE approaching the half mile mark to chase the leading pair, chased them in the three path on
the turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, and flattened inside. MAC PANDOWDY reared at the break, trailed, swung into the lane in the six to seven path,
ultimately proved no threat but passed a tiring horse late. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE chased the leading pair down the backstretch and inside around the turn,
swung out to the four to five path in upper stretch, and weakened.

Footnotes
LATIN CASINO vied outside of CHEEKERS early, edged clear from near the five eighths, set the pace in the two to three path on the turn, began to draw off
when shaken up past the quarter pole, and continued to increase his advantage under a mild drive. WILD FOX bumped with GOLDEN TONE early, was
taken to the rear between horses, chased in the four to five path with the rear pair around the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, chased on willingly
under a drive while no match for LATIN CASINO, and held place. GOLDEN TONE bumped with WILD FOX early, was taken to the inside of the rear flight,
continued to chase inside toward the rear in the three path on the turn, swung out toward the center of the track in the rear to the lane, improved mildly
outside foes and missed the place. VALLEY VISTA tracked the leading pair, came out a few times approaching the turn and brushed with AMERICAN
SANCTUARY, was pushed along while chasing in the three path on the turn, could not keep the leader in his sights when driven up the inside in upper
stretch, and flattened out in the final furlong. CHEEKERS vied inside of LATIN CASINO in the opening furlong, tracked that leader from near the five
eighths, continued in range in the two to three path on the turn, proved no match for the pacesetter in the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, and weakened
between horses. AMERICAN SANCTUARY was slightly slow into stride, raced three wide with the rear group early, inched up closer approaching the turn,
brushed a couple times with VALLEY VISTA approaching the turn as that one came out slightly, bid in the four path around the bend, began to weaken into
the lane, took up when CHEEKERS came out in front of him in upper stretch, pulled up at the three sixteenths while showing no visible signs of distress, and
was vanned off.

BOOM FIVE THOUSAND pressed the pace and made a three wide bid to take over by the quarter pole and draw clear leaving the turn, then was bumped
by the sixteenth pole and held on late, driving. DEVIL'S RULE was allowed to settle early, advanced on the turn towards the inside, shifted out four wide
leaving the turn and made a bid, came in bumping the winner by the sixteenth pole and hung late. JACK'S ADVANTAGE set a pressured pace on the inside
and faded in the drive. YOU SPLIT TENS was off a step slow, reserved early, eased out on the turn and was four wide by the quarter pole and came five
wide into the lane and had a belated rally. Z U SOON tracked the pace three to four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
DUCHOSSOIS was wrangled back to the rear early, trailed until beginning to edge closer near the five eighths, was pushed along in the three to four path
on the far turn and rallied between horses, sustained his bid under a drive between horses down the lane, wrested the lead just past the sixteenth pole and
proved best. FIRST MASAMUNE chased two wide around the clubhouse turn, chased well behind the leading trio down the backstretch, edged closer
approaching the half mile mark, bid in earnest in the four path on the far turn, engaged outside of CLARESTOWN near the quarter while under a drive,
drifted out in upper stretch while still under a drive, continued to fight on outside of CLARESTOWN and the rallying DUCHOSSOIS to his inside, and missed.
CLARESTOWN was anxious in the gate, prompted outside of TRIGGER HAPPY around the clubhouse turn, engaged to vie two wide into the backstretch,
edged clear near the eleven sixteenths, was reengaged by TRIGGER HAPPY to his inside past the five eighths, cleared again into the far turn, set the pace
in the three path around that bend, was engaged by FIRST MASAMUNE to his outside nearing the quarter, kept on at the front in upper stretch as FIRST
MASAMUNE drifted out, fought on inside of that foe and DUCHOSSOIS past the sixteenth, was finally headed by DUCHOSSOIS and flattened late. PATH
TO SUCCESS was a bit slow into stride, settled near the rear early, inched forward around the clubhouse turn to join the chasing flight three wide, chased
well behind the leading pair two wide down the backstretch, chased in the two path on the far turn, angled out midstretch and passed a tiring horse.
TRIGGER HAPPY was sent for speed inside, set the early pace while prompted by CLARESTOWN, vied inside of that foe into the backstretch, tracked the
pace past the eleven sixteenths as that foe edged clear, reengaged briefly inside the pacesetter past the five eighths, was relegated to tracking the pace
again into the far turn while racing in the two path, and emptied out in the lane. NIGHT THINGS chased inside of FIRST MASAMUNE around the clubhouse
turn, settled in second last down the back straight, raced at the rear in the two path around the far turn, was driven in upper stretch and mustered no
response. THIRSTY OWL tracked the leading pair, weakened steadily in the five path on the far turn and had no more for the drive. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION THE FRACTIONS FOR THE 1/4 MILE TIME AND MILE TIME WERE HAND TIMED.
