steadily to take over later yards. TRAVEL GIRL rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn,
was steadily encouraged leaving the turn, gave up the lead in later yards but held on for second. LOOKIN BACK settled off the rail on the opening turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in the three path of the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. KEEN MACHINE saved ground off the
pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, left the turn about the three path, angled to the inside mid-stretch and was
apprehensively ridden at the rail later yards. CHRISTINE'S COSMO veered out at the break then rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up
the chase into the backstretch but weakened into the far turn. SARAH BELLUM veered out at the break, saved ground on the first turn and never factored.

STROLLING THROUGH closed to the front leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, was met by Fifty Gray Shades nearing the quarter pole,
dueled clear of that one leaving the turn and held on under steady stretch encouragement. REAL APPEAL pressured the pace, raced off the rail on the turn
and finished well at the outside girth of the winner. POWER SONDE gave chase, ran at the rail on the turn then outfinished in the stretch duel for second.
FIFTY GRAY SHADES pressured the pace and dueled to even terms nearing the quarter pole, drifted and dropped back leaving the turn but came back to
finish evenly. SOOEY'S PRINCESS exchanged contact with DEREKA'S BLUFF leaving the gate then gave chase outside, rounded the turn in the four and
five paths and passed rivals widest in an even finish. The latter exchanged contact with Sooey's Princess leaving the gate, gave chase through the
backstretch, raced two deep while between horses on the turn then flattened inside the eighth pole. DENALI D'ORO gave chase outside, ran in the four path
of the turn then flattened. LADY SPARROW gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn, angled out leaving the turn and showed little in the lane.

LONG LEGS LOUISE saved ground off the early pace then stalked four wide leaving the first turn, bid past the three eighths pole, raced close in the four
path of the far turn, took the lead inside the eighth pole, raced clear mid-stretch and held well under steady handling. YOLO CHARLOTTE rated a short lead
inside, was met and dueled at even terms leaving the seven sixteenth pole, contested the rail into the far turn, dropped back at the rail midway on the turn
but came back in a later duel for second. CHEROKEE CASTLE broke out and made sharp contact with Bays Castle leaving the gate, settled close off the
rail on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge three wide on the far turn, was caught past the eighth pole and flattened the final
sixteenth. HESSICA angled in to stalk two deep, moved to even terms leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, contested close on the
far turn then weakened inside the eighth pole. BAYS CASTLE was jostled hard and pinched back at the break, saved ground racing well back from early
contention, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, came through the far turn about the four path and passed rivals widest in the lane. MY SISTER
PAM broke in and made sharp contact with Bays Castle and was shuffled back a stride later, rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. SARAH'S WARRIOR saved ground on the first turn and showed little response
through the backstretch. HOW IS SHE was never a factor. MISS LAUREN broke in and made contact with My Sister Pam, saved some ground on the first
turn, gave chase past the half mile pole then weakened at the rail on the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Cherokee
Castle, lodged by the rider of My Sister Pam, for alleged interference leaving the gate, though, took no action.

Footnotes
WINDSOR'S TRACKER stalked the earlier pace from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, drew to even terms two deep at the
quarter pole and took the nod midway on the far turn, drifted entering the stretch but dueled clear a sixteenth away and held on well. RED HOT TODDY
settled off the pace about the three path, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, came through the far turn still in the three path and dug in through the
final furlong to take second late strides. ROAD SLEW took the lead at the rail into the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, was met at the quarter pole, remained a close factor through the far turn and was steadily encouraged leaving the turn, but flattened stride
inside the sixteenth pole. CRISTIANO BOY saved ground on the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then
flattened in the lane. IN THE LIMELIGHT ran loose in the post parade then rounded the first turn in the four and five paths, left the turn outside, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. PULL UP MY SOCKS saved ground and never factored.
MEGALODON'SREVENGE had an early lead then stalked into the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but gave way past the three
eighths. Both Logstradamus and In High Gear ran loose in the post parade and were late scratches.
