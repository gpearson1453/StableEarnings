Footnotes
THE NEWFIE EXPRESS forced the pace outside, was challenged from both sides in the lane and battled gamely to get the nod. ANTE UP ALEX settled off
the leaders, slipped through inside into the stretch, dueled and just missed. TOO LEGIT well placed behind the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch
and continued willingly. DANCING DRAGON lacked speed, circled his field with a menacing bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. READY AT
DAWN earned a narrow lead inside to the stretch and came up empty. SUN FORESTER saved ground off the pace and faded on the turn. RIGHT TO
STRIKE chased within striking range early but was finished after half a mile.

Footnotes
CULATELLO stalked the pacesetter, easily took over at the quarter pole, extended her advantage and prevailed under mild urging. VENENOSA dropped
well behind, swung wide into the stretch and closed well in the final furlong. CLIFF'S HEAD broke alertly then was taken in hand, split rivals on the turn
rallying and finished willingly. VERMONT HOLIDAY raced just off the pace outside and lacked a solid rally. CRUMLIN BIRD moved clear early, was
engaged on the turn then weakened in the final eighth. MELROSE STAR dropped far back inside and was never in contention. REMEMBEROLDTYMES
saved ground off the leaders and faltered. DONTCALLMESWEETY saved ground close up briefly then gave way readily.

Footnotes
PRETTY RACHEL set a measured pace in the two path, moved clear into the lane then remained safe under moderate urging. VALLEY GIRL lacked speed,
raced well behind on the turn, angled wide at the quarter pole then closed well. CEFALO saved ground off the pace then continued inside with a mild rally.
PINO IN A PURSE was well placed just off the dueling leaders and flattened out in the stretch. TAKE IT EASY trailed early, advanced four wide on the turn
then no was threat. WAKE UP MAGGIE dropped back in the two path, moved very wide into the stretch and was outrun. AIRY FAIRY prompted the winner
along the inside for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
LET'S HAVE FUN alternated for the lead outside then held off challenges through the stretch in a game score. ELITE PRINCESS bid wide into the stretch,
angled inside, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. POLAR APPEAL offered a menacing four wide move on the turn then flattened out in the
lane. REIGN BY REIN dropped back early then finished well wide in the stretch. STUNNING RIVERS saved ground off the pace and lacked a rally. CORA
settled outside, bid wide on the turn and stretch and yielded. SHISHKA lunged at the start, steadied in tight near the far turn and no response. MI
TORMENTA raced off the pace and was never a factor. CANADIAN ESSENCE flashed speed inside then gave way readily.

BEAUT settled outside, advanced to the front into the stretch, led but was caught late. SOMEONE ELSE saved ground throughout and was outfinished in
the stretch. SPEAK ENGLISH chased in the two path, moved wide rallying into the lane then flattened out. NICE COMPANY broke alertly and angled inside

Footnotes
CARPE HORSESHOE settled inside the dueling leaders, angled out in the stretch, rallied and was just up at the wire. CEDAR VALLEY dueled outside, took
over into the lane, bid clear but was nailed. CLASSIC QUEEN lacked speed saving ground, steered wide near the five sixteenths then gained wide too late.
GREEN GABLES set a pressured pace along the inside then came up empty in the stretch. HEKLA'S AURA raced close up outside then flattened out in the
stretch. INFINITE PASSION chased between rivals down the backstretch and faded on the turn. DUSTY'S CHANCE trailed early then passed fading rivals.
MIZZ GEMMA moved well behind and was never in contention. BETTY'S PASSION dropped far behind and was never a factor.
