ABEEN stalked the pacesetters, waited for running room in the final turn, angled out sharply at the three sixteenth pole, then closed determinedly under
encouragement and got by just in time. MUCHO GRACIAS sat off the early pace, drove four to five wide in the final turn, dueled into the stretch outside of
CAB SAV, inched clear of rival and was caught in the final yard. CAB SAV contested the pace from just off the rail, turned back challenge from MEAN
STREAK, dueled through the stretch inside of MUCHO GRACIAS and was outfinished. MEAN STREAK pressed while four wide, moved up menacingly at
the quarter pole and had nothing left in reserve for the drive. STREAKIN AGAIN trailed the field and passed a tiring rival. MCKENZIE RED vied early, was

ONEOFTHEMGIRLS quickly took command, drew away throughout the turn, opened up under encouragement and was ridden out. SASSY BUT CLASSY
sat in range while six wide, drifted wider then dropped back into the far turn, was roused at the quarter pole, closed huge but was no real threat to the
winner. CORDILLERA raced five wide through the backstretch, went in pursuit of the leader nearing the quarter pole and flattened. LILBITSPICY raced in
traffic leaving the backstretch and tired. GHOSTLY RUNNER sat just off the pace under a snug hold and tired with two furlongs remaining. HIGH KELLY
BABE stalked the pace inside and was done early.

MIDNITESWILDAGAIN rated well off pace, drove four to five wide into the lane, rallied outside and won driving. MISYA GIRL sat just off the pace while five
wide, was carried wide leaving the backstretch, rallied outside of TAKE ME TO BATTLE and inched up for place. STEAMIN DEMON trailed the field, angled
out late stretch and bid belatedly for show. TAKE ME TO BATTLE quickly went to the front, lugged out leaving the backstretch, drifted in leaving the final
turn and yielded late. SMOKEDYA chased the pacesetters, took closer order nearing the quarter pole, lacked running room inside and gave way inside.
*Post-time Delay- The post time was delayed due to an incident in the gate. JOCKEY OBJECTION- An objection lodged by the rider of SMOKEDYA against
the rider of TAKE ME TO BATTLE alleging interference into the stretch was not allowed after review of the Board of Stewards.

SAKURABA raced wide through the backstretch, angled down to the rail in the turn, shifted out to the five path approaching the stretch, and won driving.
SOMETHIN HAPPENIN hustled away but was outsprinted to the turn, swung three to four wide at the quarter pole, rallied between rivals into the stretch and
was out finished. SANDY BEACH contested the early pace while three wide, battled through the drive and gave way grudgingly inside late. SPIRIT RACER
fanned four wide into the opening turn and passed tiring rival. FORTITUDE vied inside, took pressure inside of SANDY BEACH and had nothing left in
reserve for the drive. PRIVATE ACCESS lagged early and showed some interest late. BLINK'S ROCKET brushed rival leaving, sat off the pacesetters and
was done early. NICKYGEORGE chased outside and was outrun. BIG Z got loose from pony with rider before returning to the gate to load and never
reached contention.
