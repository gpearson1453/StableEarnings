Footnotes
STREET OF DREAMS broke readily to race in attendance to the pace three deep between foes into the first turn, pressed the issue between foes into the
second bend to gain a clear advantage, then forged a commanding advantage racing through the stretch under left handed pressure. COME ON SWEET
PEA settled last racing a bit off the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes racing through the far turn, then continued in the four path through the
stretch to edge a rival for the place honors in the closing stages. SWANAGE, urged to the lead while angling inwards from the outset, came under some
correction entering the first turn to set the pace on a narrow advantage in the two path to the backstretch, dueled for command inside rivals into the far turn
and proved no match for the winner in the drive. SILLY NOTION, forwardly placed four deep racing to the first turn, continued to force the issue three deep
through the backstretch to the second bend and gave way into the lane. TOUR FOR GOLD was prompted to contention inside rivals in the opening stages,
steadied slightly avoiding close quarters entering the first turn and dropped out after a half.

Footnotes
SHINNY stumbled at the start losing position to the field, was prompted to advance inside foes nearing the turn, moved to challenge for command racing
into upper stretch, edged forward leaving the furlong marker and narrowly prevailed under firm handling. PASSED BY PAUL was urged dictating the pace a
bit off the rail racing through the backstretch into the turn, dueled for command between foes into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but
proved only second best. TEXAS LONG BOW, forwardly placed in the three path attending the pace, pressed the issue on the turn to upper stretch and
weakened in late stages. CHICORY BLUE was rated off the first flight outside the eventual winner racing to the turn, shifted out four wide racing into upper
stretch and steadily faded in the drive. FENDER BENDER was outpaced early.

Footnotes
ASENA broke readily, attended a rival's pace under light rating in the opening stages, lost some ground to that foe racing into the bend, was urged to
advance nearing upper stretch, took over entering the lane and went clear under firm handling. CHRISTMAS POEM moved to dictate the pace along the
inside racing through the backstretch, edged clear on the turn but couldn't match the winner leaving midstretch. ROLLIN BLACKOUT swerved out at the
start impeding MONET, was taken back to race well off the second flight, swung out four wide racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a
share. CUPIDS LOVE tracked off the first flight along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane but was outkicked for a share. GOLDIE'S
DELIGHT settled along the inside racing last to the turn and passed some tiring rivals in the stretch. MONET, forced out at the start, recovered to track off
the first flight between foes in the opening stages and gave way early. PLANETARY tracked off the first flight three wide in the opening stages but soon
retreated`.

Footnotes
LINDSEY LUCK was settled outside rivals dropping off the second flight racing to the backstretch, angled to the rail after a half, steadily gained position
along the inside to upper stretch, tipped outside the leader in late stages and narrowly prevailed under firm encouragement. ICYWILBURNYEH, reserved
along the inside to the far turn, swung out five wide racing through the stretch and was going well late to close the gap on the winner. ROZEY CHEEKS,
forwardly placed between foes in the opening stages, was rated tracking off the first flight along the inside on the backstretch, moved to press the issue
between foes on the far turn, moved to gain the advantage nearing midstretch but failed to sustain that momentum. CREATING MEMORIES angled inwards
tracking off the second flight racing to the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and continued with some interest to gain position between
foes. REINA DEL SUR, off a step slowly, was settled last, then made some belated progress inside foes in the closing stages. CHA was urged to a clear
advantage along the inside racing to the backstretch, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, continued to dispute the issue grudgingly into the stretch
but gave way abruptly in the last sixteenth. FROST WARRIOR tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight, shifted out three wide racing to midstretch
but emptied out late. CANTERBURY GOLD was hustled four deep to the first turn, shifted inwards nearing the backstretch while being pressured to prompt
a rival's pace to the far turn and abruptly gave way.

Footnotes
BAYOU BENNY broke readily, stalked just outside the pacesetter racing into the turn, moved to wrest command, then shifted inwards once gaining the
advantage leaving midstretch and went clear under firm encouragement. HAPPY HOUR BOBBY sprinted to the lead racing well off the rail in the opening
stages, dueled for command into upper stretch but proved no match for the winner late. COUSVINNYSACANUCK was settled in early stages, switched out
to gain position between foes, angled to the rail when presented an opening racing into upper stretch and continued to improve position. MAGIC CASTLE,
held up in close quarters just after the start, switched out three, then four wide while being prompted to advance racing through the turn but had no closing
bid. DIRECT ACTION tracked off the first flight along the inside racing to the turn, switched out to the three path entering the lane and came up empty in the
drive. YESTERYEAR settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn and failed to menace thereafter. JACKS WILLIE was settled four wide in the
last flight racing to the turn and proved no threat. OVERSEAS LETTER was urged between foes in brief pursuit of the leaders on the backstretch but gave
way racing into the bend.

COLLEGE PARTY, off slowly, angled to the rail while being urged to a position tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, saved ground on the bend, came
through along the rail when presented an opening to challenge for command and narrowly prevailed in time under firm encouragement. MAN U was urged
along the inside disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, tipped off the rail racing into upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid grudgingly to the end
but came up second best. SKIPPY'S STRIKE settled along the inside early, tipped out racing through the turn, split foes while shifting out three wide in the
lane and continued with interest to prevail for a share. RAY'S ANGEL, urged along three wide prompting the leaders into the turn, was fanned four wide
nearing the lane and gave way into upper stretch. RAOFTHESUN tracked off the first flight outside foes racing into the turn and emptied out nearing the
lane. TAKE ME UP BRADY was urged prompting the pacesetter from the outset into the turn, pressed the issue into the lane and gave way midstretch.
WESTERN SMOKE proved no factor.

Footnotes
DAME PLATA was rated stalking off the first flight in the opening stages, steadily gained on the leaders along the inside racing through the turn, came
through inside foes to challenge for command in upper stretch, shifted out exchanging contact with THEALLIGATORHUNTER through the last furlong but
finished on even terms with that foe to share the win, The latter, in touch with the leaders three wide in early stages, pressed the issue in that path nearing
upper stretch to strike the front, shifted inwards while exchanging contact leaving the furlong marker and continued gamely to the wire to finish on even
terms for the win. PRINCE RAMA was urged inside rivals pressing the pace into the turn, was caught in tight quarters nearing midstretch and weakened in
the last furlong. HOT SHOT KID settled between foes racing through the backstretch, angled inside on the turn, then shifted out racing through the stretch to
gain some position three wide. ASTRONAUT OSCAR broke sharply, pressed the pace between foes through the backstretch into the turn and gave way
into the lane. ZOE'S DELIGHT tracked off the first flight outside a rival racing into the turn, gave way nearing the lane. WARRIOR BOSS proved no factor.
FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF PRINCE RAMA LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE ALLIGATOR HUNTER ALLEGING
INTERFERENCE IN UPPER STRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
CLICKBAIT, prominent three wide in the opening stages, angled to the inside setting the pace racing into the turn, steadily widened her advantage and was
kept to pressure. READY TO RUNAWAY, in touch with the first flight between foes in the opening furlong, was rated just off the leaders nearing the turn,
was prompted to advance nearing upper stretch and proved clearly best of the others. HOTASAPISTOL was urged inside foes pressing the pace from the
outset into the turn and faded into upper stretch. MOLLY'S ANGEL tracked off the first flight while angling inside but offered no rally. OWEN'S PLEASURE
was settled into stride shifting off the inside, angled four wide in upper stretch but had no rally. DIVA DE KELA was always outrun.
