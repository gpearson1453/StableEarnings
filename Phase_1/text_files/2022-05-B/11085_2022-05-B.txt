Footnotes
FLASHY RICHIE trailed the field on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn, began a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole and pulled
clear late. RECKLESSNESS chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, could not go with
the winner in the final furlong and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. TSALI raced off the pace between horses through the opening quarter of a
mile, came around the turn three wide, swung out into the stretch, gained ground on the outside while drifting and was outkicked late. MINISTRY OF ART
raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and gained ground on the outside late while never
truly threatening. BLOOMING GARDEN chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path passing the three
eighths pole and flattened out in the stretch. ON THE MUSCLE showed early speed up the backstretch, continued to lead the way while saving ground
around the turn and tired in the lane.

RESTORING HOPE tracked outside of CYRIL'S BOY through the opening furlong, inched closer to prompt him past the five eighths, vied outside that foe in
the three path on the turn and three wide into upper stretch, continued to battle CYRIL'S BOY to the sixteenth mark while drifting out slightly, and edged to a
defined lead in the final sixteenth. CYRIL'S BOY sett the pace between horses early, vied inside of RESTORING HOPE while racing in the two path on the
turn, continued to vie into the lane while positioned two wide, drifted out slightly while continuing to fight for the lead, but was outfinished in the final
sixteenth. COCO BRAVADO settled back to chase the leading trio past the eleven sixteenths, chased four wide around the turn and five wide into upper
stretch, and rallied mildly for the show while drifting out. MISTER CHARMING settled at the rear, raced in the two path at the rear around the turn, came
three wide into the lane and lacked the needed kick between horses. TODDLES attended the early pace inside of CYRIL'S BOY, settled back to track
behind that foe from the five eighths, chased the leading pair while saving ground on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
JR'S GIFT bumped with the horses to his outside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up
the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, began a bid nearing the three sixteenths pole, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear.
BRUCE BANNER hopped up leaving the gate, recovered to press the pace between horses around the first turn and up the backstretch, challenged from
the two path while racing around the far turn and chased the eventual winner home, the best of the rest. FORWARD CURVE saved ground around the first
turn, showed the way while racing up the backstretch, battled from the rail around the far turn, gave way with a furlong to go and finished evenly. ALEXIS N
NIKO brushed with the horses to either side leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, steadied slightly near the half mile pole while
racing into traffic in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and improved position mildly on the rail in
the stretch. BROTHER HAROLD raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two and three path and weakened from there. TEA AFTER BALLET saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, began to drop back while saving ground around the far turn and showed no kick. LARK bumped with the horses to
either side leaving the gate, raced at the back of the pack while saving ground through the opening half mile, switched to the three path for the run around
the far turn, swung wide entering the stretch and made no bid. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, trailed the field
on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and never fired. TRUIST saved ground around the first
turn, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
MI ENLACE was in a bit tight in the opening strides, settled toward the rear, began to inch forward approaching the five eighths, rallied three wide on the far
turn, headed CERTAIN HEARTS at the five sixteenths, cleared four wide under a drive in upper stretch, and held safe the rest of the way under only a mild
drive late. WEEKEND PASS settled near the rear, was pushed along in the four path on the far turn and responded with a bid, swung four wide into upper
stretch, angled in and rallied through horses, chased on willingly to the finish under a drive in side but could not reel in the winner. BELLS OF JOY chased
the leading trio through the first turn and into the back straight, continued to chase the leading pair past the five eighths, tracked in range in the two path on
the far turn, proved no match for MI ENLACE under a drive in upper stretch, could not match the kick of WEEKEND PASS into the final furlong but chased
on best of the rest. SPECIAL CONQUEST trailed, began to take closer order in the three path on the far turn, swung out to the eight path in upper stretch,
and rallied past tiring horses. GRAMMAR chased inside foes around the first turn and down the back straight, continued midpack in the two to three path
around the far turn, swung four wide into upper stretch and came up empty from the three sixteenths. CERTAIN HEARTS set a contested pace while keen,
vied outside of CHINA STAR into the far turn, briefly cleared past the three eighths when CHINA STAR emptied out, was confronted by MI ENLACE and
headed near the five sixteenths, and weakened in the lane. CHINA STAR steadied behind CERTAIN HEARTS into the clubhouse turn, tracked the pace
inside around that first bend, engaged inside of the pacesetter into the backstretch, vied inside of CERTAIN HEARTS into the far turn, began to weaken
inside from the three eighths and had no more in the lane. JANE'S GOLD TOUR broke inward, stalked the pace outside of CERTAIN HEARTS, began to
weaken from the eleven sixteenths, continued to back up in the five path on the far turn and was allowed to trail home.

KING TITO led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn and remained in command down the lane.
FINAL CALL raced at the back of the pack through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid coming into the stretch and
gained ground on the outside from there. AWESOME FAMILY chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and
finished evenly. INDIAN SIGN raced off the pace in the early going, came around the turn in the two path, gained ground in upper stretch and was outkicked
in the final furlong. YALIKEANYTHING trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, and gained ground in late stretch,
passing tiring horses on the rail. BEE HAPPY ATTACK stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the
three path and weakened in the lane. DAY IN THE COUNTRY hit the gate leaving it, recovered to track the pace setter between horses up the backstretch,

Footnotes
PADDY'S HOUSE took back to settle near the rear, was pushed along into the turn and rallied four wide, came four wide into the lane, came in slightly in
front of BLAZEN ROAD in upper stretch while clear of that foe, drove to the lead at the three sixteenths, cleared approaching the furlong mark and drew off.
BLAZEN ROAD tracked outside of DUST DANCER, was pushed along into the turn to keep tabs on that foe around the bend, came three wide into the lane
in close range, altered out when PADDY'S HOUSE came inward in front of him in upper stretch, and kept on with interest under a drive to secure the place.
DUST DANCER set the pace inside, came two wide into the lane, was confronted on both sides in upper stretch and headed by PADDY'S HOUSE near the
three sixteenths, proved no match for that foe approaching the furlong mark, and flattened out inside. DEORA STORE settled at the rear, continued in the
two to three path on the turn, swung out seven wide into the lane, passed tiring horses in upper stretch and continued to chase on willingly through the final
furlong. KEEP ATTACKING settled toward the rear, was pushed along two wide between horses on the turn, mustered a brief inside bid into the lane and
loomed at the head of the stretch but emptied out from the three sixteenths. TUFF ATTACK chased the leading trio down the backstretch, continued to
chase three wide between horses around the turn, swung six wide into the lane and proved empty. W W TRAFALGAR was anxious in the gate, tracked
behind the leading pair down the back straight, weakened along the rail around the turn and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
PINEDALE hit the gate leaving it, raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path, swung wide entering the stretch, dueled on the outside brushing with DYNABLUE near the eighth pole and pulled clear in the final
furlong. DYNABLUE pressed the pace from the three path around the first turn, chased the frontrunner up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around
the far turn and in upper stretch, bumped with KANITHAPPEN and PINEHURST with a furlong to go and chased the eventual winner home from there.
KANITHAPPEN saved ground around the first turn, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled on the inside around the far turn and into the lane, bumped
with DYNABLUE in midstretch and gave way late. WHERE'S LUCKY saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and made no bid. MADELYNS HEAT trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch,
improved position while racing in the two path around the far turn, drifted in in upper stretch and flattened out in late stretch.

rear in the four path on the turn, was pushed along and responded near the five sixteenths, swung five wide into the lane under a drive, sustained his rally,
took the lead just past the furlong mark and held safe to the finish. W W CRAZY tracked the leader four wide down the back straight and three deep in the
four path on the turn, was driven four wide in upper stretch, came in on DERBY DATE near the furlong pole, and chased on willingly while no match for
NAVY SEAL. DERBY DATE broke outward, tracked the leader inside of foes in the opening furlong, raced between horses past the five eighths when HIDE
THE DEMON joined to his inside, tracked the leading pair between horses in the three path on the turn, was shut off between horses past the three
sixteenths and altered out, got bumped by W W CRAZY near the furlong mark, kept on with continued interest and held the show. HIDE THE DEMON was
squeezed between horses at the start due to DERBY DATE breaking outward and EL ASESINO breaking inward into NAVY SEAL, gathered himself at the
rear, inched forward to join the tracking flight inside of DERBY DATE near the five eighths, tracked the leading pair along the rail around the turn, was
caught inside behind EL ASESINO in upper stretch, altered out five wide to get around foes, rerallied in the final sixteenth and was gaining late. LITTLE
KANSAS tracked the pace three wide between horses down the backstretch, inched forward to prompt the pace outside of EL ASESINO approaching the
turn, headed that foe near the three eighths while racing in the three path, took a narrow lead three wide into the lane, was headed by NAVY SEAL just past
the furlong pole, began to weaken, drifted inward near the sixteenth and continued to flatten. EL ASESINO broke inward into NAVY SEAL, was nonetheless
put on the lead, took prompting from LITTLE KANSAS past the nine sixteenths, saved ground on a narrow lead into the turn, was headed by LITTLE
KANSAS near the three eighths, was driven inside into the lane while still in close range of the new leader, began to flatten past the furlong mark, steadied
slightly when LITTLE KANSAS drifted in near the sixteenth pole and continued to flatten.

ERIN'S ENTHUSIASM raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, split horses to began a bold move near
the eighth pole and pulled clear. AVASARALA brushed with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead up the backstretch, shook
clear while saving ground around the turn, battled in upper stretch and chased the winner home, just holding second. WHITE LIES dueled on the outside
through the opening quarter of a mile, raced between horses in the two path around the turn, lost some ground in upper stretch and finished well.
MAYSTART raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch
and finished evenly on the outside. PALM COURT brushed with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, tracked the leaders on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the turn and flattened out in late stretch. RARE ACTION ATTACK broke slowly and was shut out leaving the gate, trailed
thee field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, and gained ground mildly in the lane while never threatening. JUDY'S MS. OFFICER
stalked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and tired from there.
BEENTHEREDONETHAT stumbled leaving the gate, settled at the back of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the
turn and made no bid.
