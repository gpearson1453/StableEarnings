Footnotes
VOLNAY , four deep on the turn stalking the pace, was fanned six wide in upper stretch, gained the lead outside horses in the drive and drew off.
PRINCESS COREY bumped RAVENEL when bumped and forced in by GRACE ISABELLA leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn,
found room inside horses through the stretch and flattened out. MAKE IT A DOUBLE prompted the pace outside R TRUE SENSATION, gained the lead in
upper stretch, opened a clear advantage in mid stretch and weakened. TORCH CARRIER saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path in mid stretch
and lacked the needed late effort. RAVENEL , bumped at the start, raced wide on the turn and was fanned to the seven path in upper stretch. GRACE
ISABELLA bumped PRINCESS COREY when bearing in at the break, raced near the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch but failed to be a factor.
R TRUE SENSATION showed speed near the inner rail, drifted out turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
MOSLER SAFE chased off the inside, angled out a bit wider on the turn and circled four wide into the lane, closed in under solid handling, took command in
deep stretch, kicked clear then held sway. IMAGINE IT ALL , fractious and a bit reluctant to load, raced within range while three deep heading into the turn,
raced a bit green leaving the far turn and dropped back some, shifted out five wide for the drive, leveled off through the final furlong, closed willingly and
nabbed the place. GLASTONBURY sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, remained clear while two wide into the stretch, drifted in a bit in upper
stretch, was soon corrected, braced for a challenge nearing the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. PICKIN SEA GLASS , fractious behind the gate
and bit difficult to load, hustled up to contention, chased the leader two to three wide, drifted in some near mid stretch and came up empty. GALWAY LAD
saved ground pursuing the pace, eased out some past mid stretch then was stymied in a bit of traffic through the final sixteenth. BIG DADDY D R was
steadied off rivals nearing the turn, saved ground mid turn, came out for the drive but failed to generate a solid kick. E. P. MILTON , four wide, was not a
factor. HOOKEAI lagged back and failed to make serious headway.

CHRISATUDE , unhurried in the two path around the turn, was taken to the three path approaching the eighth pole, closed between horses and was up at
the wire. SUBJECT TO CHANGE set a pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD prompted the pace outside
SUBJECT TO CHANGE and weakened in the drive. SHOULDA HAD IT , well placed three wide turning for home, drifted out in mid stretch and flattened
out. FORT FORTITUDE , three wide on the turn, angled to the four path turning for home and failed to rally. MOON LAUNCH , outrun, swung four wide
leaving the turn. CHAMPIONSHIP ALLEY , along the inner ral around the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
GRAVITRON cleared without much asking in the opening sixteenth, dropped in towards the rail and set a rated pace, opened up after being put to a strong
drive in upper stretch, continued under pressure to the sixteenth pole then was geared down through the final fifty yards. MUSICAL CAT , five wide leaving
the three quarter pole, circled four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to out kick STARTWITHABANG for the place. STARTWITHABANG rated off of
a rival into the first turn, angled out and moved up between rivals nearing the five eighths, continued progress three wide to take aim into the far turn, was
turned away by the winner leaving the five sixteenths but gave willing chase to the inside of MUSICAL CAT to the wire. A REAL HERO , well placed stalking
the pace while saving ground, came under pressure past the three eighths, got through along the rail into the lane but came up empty. POUNDING MUSIC
tracked outside the winner, was under a ride past the three eighths, failed to kick on nearing the stretch and weakened. GIRL'S ON FIRE broke a step slow,
raced three wide nearing the five eighths and faltered.

bore out leaving the starting gate, raced in the three path between horses leaving the turn and rallied nicely. DRUM AND BASS lacked speed, raced four
wide on the turn and rallied outside horses. FLAMING EAST , caught in tight quarters at the start, chased the pace well off the rail and weakened. GERRYS
GEM saved ground around the turn, raced in the two path inside horses in the stretch and failed to rally. POP POP SUSI showed speed, disputed the pace
to mid stretch and weakened. QUINCANNON bore out at the break, steadied lightly in traffic leaving the turn and swerved out in mid stretch. BLISS THIS
hugged the inner rail around the turn and lacked a rally. ICANDOTHAT bobbled then was caught in close quarters leaving the starting gate and was outrun.

Footnotes
JUSTALITTLEVIOLENT ducked out at the break, straightened and moved up three wide to prompt the pace, was put to a solid ride while keeping tabs on
the leader into the lane, drew alongside past the three sixteenths, dueled, secured command inside the furlong grounds then kicked clear late while under a
drive. PROPER ATTIRE was hustled to the front, shook clear into the turn and set a rated pace, came two wide into the lane, dug in when collared nearing
mid stretch, dueled inside the winner leaving the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly. MOODY WOMAN lagged off the pace while saving ground,
eased out past the three sixteenths, split foes in the final sixteenth and found her best too late. OLIVE KAT chased outside a rival, shifted out four wide for
the drive but came up empty in the final seventy yards. GOLDEN CAN had speed to the inside of PROPER ATTIRE, rated back off that one entering the
turn, stalked while saving ground into the stretch and faded. BEHIND THE COUCH checked sharply while saving ground into the turn, angled out five wide
in the drive but lacked a serious recovery.

Footnotes
CHARDONNAY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, floated out a bit in upper stretch and held sway under brisk urging.
CONTINENTALCONGRES , alertly taken to the inner rail entering the first turn, remained along the rail thereafter and rallied nicely. CHARMING WAY bore
out leaving the starting gate, was rated down the backstretch, raced in the four path around the far turn, had aim on the lead in mid stretch and flattened out.
UNADULTERATED , three wide both turns, chased the pace to upper stretch then weakened. BLUEBERRY INDYGO , bumped by CHARMING WAY
leaving the starting gate, chased the pace outside the winner and faltered entering the stretch. JERUSALEMA lacked speed, was in the five path leaving the
backstretch then steadily retreated. JACKIE THE JOKER , taken under a snug rating hold soon after the break, trailed.

Footnotes
IMAGE MAKER , bumped at the break, angled out early and stalked three wide, moved up to engage the embattled leaders leaving the three eighths, took
command soon into the lane, spurted clear past the three sixteenths, steadily widened under a strong drive inside the sixteenth pole then held firm. TOY
vied outside HEARTNESS, fought on between runners past the five sixteenths pole, failed to kick on with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on with
effort to be clear for the place. HEARTNESS took over early and secured the inside, was hounded by TOY, dueled inside rivals while under a stiff ride past
the five sixteenths, stayed on to mid stretch then weakened. PRINCIPALITY lagged far back while saving ground, eased out in upper stretch but failed to
menace. RUN ON THE TRAIL broke outward and bumped with the winner, was a bit keen while saving ground just off the leaders, stalked into the far turn,
failed to go on under a ride leaving the three eighths and faltered.
