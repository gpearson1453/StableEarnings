Footnotes
FORMENTOR settled behind the leader early on the rail, waited while inside on the turn ,angled out for the stretch run and was up in the final strides. SHE
MAKES ME TIZZY was away sharply and set the controlling pace throughout, fought gamely down the lane and just missed. NORTHERN PASSAGE was
mid pack in the early stages ,made a mild rally on the turn and finished well to get third. FAVORITE CHANNEL raced three wide on the turn then was 7 wide
entering the stretch and levelled out. WALTZOFTHESAMURAI stalked the early pace and weakened down the lane. MY LAST DREAM was near the back
early and never got into contention.

Footnotes
ME AND MY SHADOW came up the inside to duel for command, came off the turn three wide and shook clear, then drew out to prove best under a drive.
BORN DAPPER dueled for the lead two wide and outside of the winner, was floated out leaving the turn by that rival, proved to be no match for that rival,
while staying on to be clearly second best. CAIRO CONSORT vied for the early lead and then stalked the front runners three wide, faded in the drive while
staying on to best the rest. FAST'N SEXY tracked the early pace and then dropped down to the inside on the turn and lacked the needed rally on the inside
through the lane. CANADIANSWEETHEART was off a step slow, then went up to raced three wide on the turn, drifted out in the lane and had no rally. A
GAL FOR T J after being a little slow into stride, settled five wide entering the turn, then raced four to five wide on the turn and came six wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY was off a step slow, reserved early and swung out four wide for the drive and lacked a rally while racing greenly.
MY GIRL GABBY chased the early pace on the inside, checked around the three eighths marker and dropped back. UNPASSABLE showed little.

Footnotes
KAWACATOOSE dueled for the lead two wide early, then made a three wide bid leaving the turn, shook clear by the sixteenth pole and then remained safe
late to prove best, driving. KID FORESTER was allowed to settle early and saved ground on the turn, shifted off the inside in the lane and closed well late,
split rivals in deep stretch to gain the place award. SOUPER CLASSY was allowed to settle early and was three wide on the turn, angled out to the outside
leaving the furlong marker and had a late rally to gain the show award. CELEBRATORY tracked the pace two wide on the turn, tipped out four wide for aim,
made a bid in the lane and loomed boldly but hung late while needing more. OCELOT dueled for the early lead and made a inside bid on the turn, continued
to duel nearing the furlong marker and then gave way grudgingly. SEA SCOUT was reserved early, swung out four wide for the drive and lacked a rally.

FULL EXTREME was reserved early three wide, advanced four wide by the quarter pole, came five wide in to the lane and continued that bid and edged
clear late to prove best under a drive. AVOMAN was rated along early and was three wide on the turn, made a four wide bid lleaving the turn and led by the
sixteenth pole but it was not enough, good effort. LAPOCHKA was allowed to settle early and was on the inside on the far turn, shifted out four wide leaving
the turn, then was in traffic nearing the furlong marker and awaited room, then finished willingly to gain the show award. NATIVE PRINCE was well placed
on the inside, then was boxed on the inside by the quarter pole, shifted out two wide to make a bid, kept on but needed more. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was
reserved early, eased out on the turn and advanced three wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive and offered a belated rally. JUAN PABLO was
settled back on the inside and angled out in the drive and had no rally. FARAWAY KITTEN was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and
made a three wide bid leaving the turn and then weakened in the final furlong. COLEYVILLE lacked a rally. ROGUE AFFAIR set the early pace and then
gave way in the drive.

LOBBY BAR brushed the gate on the break, settled mid pack early, loomed three wide around the turn and accelerated down the lane to draw clear.
COLLABORATIVE was asked to keep up to the leader down the backside and going into the turn, angled out in the stretch to get up for the place. BORN
HAPPY was away sharply and set the early fractions while on the rail, was collared at the eighth pole and weakened. PRIMORDIAL FEAR was away slow
and checked slightly entering the turn, angled outside for the drive and levelled out. GRAN ARTIETUDE had a sluggish start and trailed the field.

TWELFTH MOON stalked the leader on the rail then angled out going into the turn ,loomed up entering the stretch and took command at the eighth pole
and held on to prevail. DIXIE MORNING was allowed to settle near the rear early, rallied three wide to contend at the quarter pole and fought gamely down
the stretch but could not overtake the winner. SWIRLING DANCER stalked the early leaders on the rail ,waited inside on the turn and rallied mildly to gain
third. FOREST B was away alertly setting the early fractions until she was collared at the eighth pole and weakened. GOLD FORESTER trailed early, was
urged on the turn and had nothing left for the drive and flattened out.

Footnotes
LOYALTY was bumped at the start, went up to set a pressured pace on the inside, repelled bid from HARD EDGE on the turn and shook clear leaving the
turn and then remained clear to prove best under mild urging and being shown the riding crop. HARD EDGE pressed the winner and made a three wide bid
on the turn, could not match strides with that rival in the lane but stayed on gamely to be clearly second best. CONSTITUTION GAL was well placed on the
inside, angled out in the stretch for racing room but lacked the needed winning bid. CALLE OCHO was bumped at the start, rated between horses on the
turn, shifted out four wide leaving the turn and had no kick. VERDEJO was allowed to settle early and was on the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside in
the lane but had no rally. RICHIES NOBLE GIRL was reserved early and was two wide on the turn and in between rivals, swung out four wide leaving the
turn and had no rally. IN MY OPINION was settled back early and passed the tiring rivals on the inside. SOUPER PECAN was settled back early, angled out
widest for the stretch drive and had no rally. TAKOTA was rated along early and made a mild bid four wide on the turn and then was empty. MRS. DEL
chased the pace and was five wide on the turn and weakened. STARLIGHT RIDGE was rank between rivals early, then made way to the outside and tired.
