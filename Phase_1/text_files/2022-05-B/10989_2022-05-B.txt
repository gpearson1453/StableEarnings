after the rough start was on right lead throughout under a hand ride. CASH IN THE CARD away cleanly, stumbled hard on second stride, asked once right
handed and hand ridden to wire. DECLINE TO RULE had to be loaded rider less, stumbled and came in, bumped with rival at the start, quickly lost path and
