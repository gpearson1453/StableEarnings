PRAIRIE FIREBALL was squeezed between rivals at the start, moved four wide to bid through the far turn and show in front turning for home then held safe
under steady handling. RABBIT TWENTY TWO stalked the pace two and three wide, continued willingly in the lane and gained the place. SCARLETT
O'HANNA dropped back off the pace, moved closer while three wide going to the far turn, angled out in the lane but could not run down the top pair. DIXIE
TRIXIE was on the pace outside a rival to the far turn, remained in reach into the lane but could not produce the needed late effort. ANGIE'S REVRAC
saved ground in reach of the pace but lacked a final closing run. LAURA N LUKAS saved ground and was not a factor. CRIMSON T. showed early foot
about the two or three path and tired in the far turn.

Footnotes
PICKELJUICE contested the early pace about the two path inside rivals, took back going to the far turn and was angled out, rallied four wide into the lane
and went well to the wire. MISS ADDISYN K was on the pace three wide then inside a rival, continued well into the lane but could not handle the winner.
CHARED moved up four wide to bid outside the leaders going to the far turn and came up empty in the lane. J TRAIN failed to mount a rally three and four
wide. PICKLES N ME saved ground and weakened. TREPI'S TRPL CROWN failed to mount a solid bid three wide. PETE AND REPETE was not a threat.
CREEDS REVENGE was not a factor.
