Footnotes
CHARLIES HURRICANE dueled inside a rival but off the fence mostly in the two to three path, edged away late. BIKINILESS dueled outside the winner
three to four wide, was no match. LILLY DEAREST raced outside a rival two to three wide, was no match for the top pair but best of the rest. SISTER LOU
was fractious in the gate, saved ground on the turn, had no rally. I GET STORMED swung six wide into the stretch and improved position. DYNAMIC
WOMAN went in the two to three path on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. INDY GAL DORO raced outside rivals off the leaders three to five
wide on the turn, was not a factor. ARTFUL ROSE broke a step slowly, bore out badly past the three-sixteenths. DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION RACE
WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
WAYLAY dueled outside a rival two wide through the turn, put that one away and edged clear into upper stretch, held sway. AISLE RUNNER stalked the
dueling leaders going three to four wide on the turn, closed the gap but needed more. PARK LANE LAD tracked in behind the leaders and inside a rival,
went two then three wide on the turn, was best of the rest. INDIAN GAMBLER dueled inside the winner, weakened. BULLY RIDE went three then four wide
on the turn, ran on. DINOS DA DADDY saved ground on the turn, failed to rally. SMOOTHING IRON was taken back from between rivals in the early going,
came out leaving the turn and ran on. FRED chased mid-pack two to three wide, came up empty. BABY SHAMU was outrun while racing off the inside.

AWESOME K P settled off the leaders three wide, advanced on the far turn going between rivals three deep then coming out a bit turning for home, took
aim and drove past late. HOTFOOT vied two wide between rivals, moved clear late on the far turn, was no match for the winner. NORTHERN QUEST was
just a bit fractious in the gate, caught four wide early, moved in a path on the far turn, advanced past rivals inside to run along for show honors. GORKY
PARK settled mid-pack two to three wide, shifted six wide coming past the three-sixteenths and ran on. LEATHERNECK tracked inside, came out three
wide turning for home, lacked the needed late kick. BAYERN TO BE WILD switched out three wide in the early going, swung seven wide into upper stretch
and passed rivals. FLICKERING LIGHT was a bit fractious in the gate, broke several lengths slowly and reared at the start, raced mostly two to three wide.
KONA COAST was within range four to five wide, came up empty. HARROVIAN set a pressured pace inside, faltered and faded. TAINO HOUSE was
forwardly-placed three to four wide between rivals, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
ELEGANT CRICKET set the pace racing off the rail and in the clear, held sway. TRICKESSY tracked inside on or just off the rail, came out a bit turning for
home and closed the gap. D'TATWAY caught three wide through the first turn, moved out and advanced outside rivals up the backstretch to reach striking
distance, moved back in a bit and went three wide on the far turn, evened out in the lane. POCO SUENOS saved ground on or just off the rail early, moved
out from two to four wide on the far turn and ran on. SHESAPACKINPUNCHES stalked three wide early, dropped back three to four wide on the far turn and
weakened in the stretch. BEAUTIFUL BOUNTY settled well back moving in from three to two wide on the first turn, saved ground on the far turn, passed
tired rivals. INVODKAWETRUST stalked four wide early, dropped back four to six wide on the far turn and came up empty. CAROLS BOUTIQUE was
caught four wide into the first turn, continued three to four deep on the far turn and failed to threaten. MISS RULES broke a step slowly, raced mostly four to
five wide and was not a factor. MULLIGAN tracked mid-pack two wide, faded.

Footnotes
OVERTIDE contested the pace two wide, was all out late and just lasted. TUTTA TERLINGUA was urged at the break but lacking much speed, chased
going three then five wide on the turn, was gaining too late and missed. TIGHT FITTIN JEANS vied inside, kept on but needed more late. SEXY BIKINI
MODEL was urged at the break, moved out from two to four wide on the turn, was gaining late but missed. BULLY BABY stalked three wide, had no late
kick. THATGIRL'SONFIRE was forwardly-positioned two wide, steadied slightly about the three-eighths, failed to rally. MARKING TIME went three wide on
the turn and failed to menace. AUTUMN TOUCH settled well back, went two wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten. MINDOFMYOWN
steadied just after the break, shifted in, saved ground on the turn under a strong hold, had no late bid. SHUGS CHARLIE was not a factor after going three
to four wide on the turn.

GO FOR THE LAUGH moved clear up the backstretch to dictate terms racing off the rail, held safe. EZ GUESS broke a bit awkwardly, advanced near inside
on the turn and shifted out five wide turning for home, gained late. EL JOKER saved ground on or just off the rail and ran on evenly. SUPER HUNK stalked
three to four wide and lacked the needed late kick. BITTEN was forced five to six wide on the turn, improved position. FOUR SOCKS WHO swung six wide
into the stretch and passed tired foes. CHA CHING CHARLIE pursued the leaders three wide and came up empty. AX 'S SHORE was mid-pack three to
four wide, steadily retreated. JAMIE CAN'T DANCE broke awkwardly, moved forward having shifted out, dropped back four wide on the turn and came up
empty.
