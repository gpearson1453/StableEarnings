battled the winner inside to deep stretch and finished gamely. WATER WIZARD Set the pace along the rail, was collared midway around, chased inside and
finished with interest. LUCKY SITKA Broke a step slow, slow to settle, four wide on the turn, appeared to be gaining outside and could only muster a mild
bid. STAR MANAGER Broke sluggishly, close up inside early, two path on the bend and tired. STARSHIP PRANKSTER Four wide into the turn, three path

SABREEN Broke a step slow, well placed along the three path into the turn, angled out some, collared the leader with a furlong remaining and drove clear
late. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE Hopped at the start, rushed out to contest the lead along the rail, battled inside with the winner and then finished well to be
second best. EASY PLAY Vied for the lead from the outset, two path on the turn, dropped back some nearing the furlong marker, altered out in the stretch
and finished with interest. MIDMON Four wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and lacked the late needed response. MELISSA'S SMILE Unhurried along
the two path into the turn, took the rail midway around and weakened inside. BECKY'S MISSION Saved ground on the turn, eased out into the lane and
tired.
