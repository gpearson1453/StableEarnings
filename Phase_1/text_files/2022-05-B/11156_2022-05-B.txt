CLOSER TOTHE TRUTH pressed the early pace into the turn while three wide, cleared in late turn, widened to the eighth pole and maintained while under
vigorous hand drive to the end. HONEY RED saved ground through the turn when in mid-pack, came into the lane from the four path and chased the winner
home while second best. B FLAT OUT was bothered early when another took her path, raced near the inside through the turn and into the lane and was
never a threat. K S GERALDINE pressed the pace from between rivals into the turn,chased the winner into the lane then faded. ENVIABLE gained the early
lead into the turn, was getting out and checked sharply while man-handled to mid-track, raced in the four path through the turn and never was in it
thereafter. ZIINZI came into the turn from the four path, was soon checked when rival came out sharply, continued well back into the lane and was never in
it. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY CONCERNING THE RUNNING OF THE RACE IN THE FAR TURN, #1ENVIABLE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIFTH

Footnotes
MR CHAOS pressed the pacesetter from the three path into the turn, moved to vied with that one while confidently ridden, cleared into the lane, opened his
largest advantage with an eighth to go, was still well clear inside the sixteenth pole then was under a drive to the wire while shortening a bit. AZZARO
STEEL trailed along the inside into the turn, continued along the inside into the lane and was gaining to the end to be clear for the place spot. MOWINS
chased the two rival duel through the turn while in the three path, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the leader then lacked the needed
response. SACRED SKY set the pace while near the rail, continued to chase the leader into the lane then flattened late. G AS IN GEORGE was never a
threat while in the two or three path through the turn. VICE COP tracked the pace while in the two path through mid-turn then was empty turning into the
lane.

Footnotes
NO KAY NEVER (IRE) was under pressure into the turn, cleared in mid-turn, widened into the lane then held while being kept to the task. BOURBON
THERAPY pressed the winner two wide into the turn, could not keep up with that one through the turn, kept aim on the top one while coming into the lane
from the four path and finished evenly. BAYTOWN JAGGER saved ground through the turn and into the lane and finished evenly. HIPPIE TRAIL was close
up early, settled back into mid-turn while in the three to the two path, continued in the two path into the lane and was never a threat. PLAIN OR PEANUT
lunged inwardly at the start and spotted the field some five lengths, raced in the two path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and
moved up. REVERE NOTE was never a factor while in the four path through the turn. FASTBYTE leaned on the inside of the gate and broke slowly spotting
the field some seven lengths, saved ground through the turn and into the lane and never was in it. RECIO'S BAYTOWN was in the two path through the turn
and when near the back then was empty into the lane.

ROCK N JUNE BUG led early between foes, bid at the three-eighths pole, then drew off in the stretch and lasted under steady urging. POLAR WIND was
unrushed early in the four path, rallied belatedly but missed. VIOLENT GIGI raced in the three path, then bid late outside for the show spot. CAP DE
FUEGO pressed early in the three path, then was no match. TRIPULANTE was off awkwardly, then raced evenly. A FEW TOO MANY stalked the pace
between foes, then faded in the stretch. BLUEMOON JUSTICE was no factor outside. MACHO ROCCO saved ground to no avail.

CATCHAFALLNSTAR was unhurried while off the inside, came into the lane from the three path, guided to the six path when gaining momentum then
finished in a rush to be rolling late. MISS LUV SHACK vied for the early lead while two wide, cleared in late turn, widened to the eighth pole, was well clear
inside the sixteenth pole then was caught late. MOLLY'S WARRIOR chased the pace through the turn while in the four path, came into the lane from the five
path then chased the top ones to the wire while best of the rest. ANAITA was guided off the inside approaching the turn, moved three wide two be in
menacing position in mid-turn, continued to chase the pace into the lane then weakened inside the eighth pole. GIFT OF FAITH settled off the pace early,
bid five wide through mid-turn, was under a right-handed drive approaching the quarter pole, continued in the five path into the lane then flattened. OH LA
DE DA was in the two to the four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five or six path and moved up while not a threat. ALLIE MAES
REVENGE never a factor while saving ground. DREAMERS DREAM was done early while in the two path. NEVER TO MANY HUGS bumped at the start,
hustled to contend before first call, chased the pace into mid-turn and was done. WOO WOO GIRL hopped at the start, hustled up to race in mid-pack then

Footnotes
CAPTAIRE pressed the pace in the two path, bid at the quarter pole to be clear and lasted under mild urging. MISSONI stalked in the five path, bid at the
quarter pole, then couldn't get to the winner. SAKONNA was unrushed early and rallied belatedly six wide. CONNECTTHECAUSEWAY stalked in the two
path, bid three wide at the quarter pole but faltered in the drive. FRENCH CUFFS was off awkwardly, bid between foes near the three-eighths pole, then
faltered in the drive. SPRING MAGIC was brushed at the start, raced in the five path, bid at the quarter pole, then couldn't close late. MIDSUMMER
NIGHTS saved ground to no avail. MI CRESCENDO raced inside, bid at the quarter pole, then gave way in the stretch. FAST TRANSIT saved ground to no
avail. SIMPLY COMPLICATED broke outward, pressed the pace for a half mile and then gave way. MEDWAY QUEEN was clear early, was caught on the
far turn and gave way. QUARIA BRAVA was bumped at the start.
