Footnotes
IT'S ALL A BLUR saved ground down the backstretch, then rallied four wide on the turn to edge clear in late stretch to prevail. IZEADISTORTEDLADY
stumbled at the start then raced three wide behind the leader, assumed command at the top of the turn, but gave way in the end. VENUS ISLAND settled
along the inside then made a mild bid entering the stretch but was no factor. NELLIE DEE was unhurried early, then swung five wide on the turn to bid but it
was too little too late and was no threat. ATHENIAN PRINCESS stalked the leader while two wide, was in tight on the turn, steadied, then continuedd to bid
three wide but weakened in the stretch drive. CHERISH THE DAY set the pace inside, was in a hard drive, was used up and tired on the turn.

PEEK FACTOR made the lead, racing along the rail, getting pressed by EAGLE CAT through mid stretch, then dug in and drew off from the field to win
easily. EAGLE CAT was in contention early, going three wide, pressing the leader, then rallied down the lane, but was second best today. AMANTE DE
SARA bore out at the break, bumping a foe, then raced up to stalk the pace, along the rail, and made a bid to hold on to show. MORO NALA got bumped at
the break and squeezed back, then rolled up to mid pack and offered a mild bid in the stretch drive. L L COOL GREY was mid field, four wide, then made a
bid in the turn, but flattened out in the stretch. BERINGS LIGHT pressed the pace early, going two wide and faded in the stretch drive. TRINITY QUEEN
was near the back, three wide, and was no factor. SHE'S A RIDGE trailed the field, four wide and showed little.

ALGEBRA angled on the first turn to set the pace along the inside, was in a long drive down the backstretch into the far turn, was passed by an outside rival
mid stretch but came on again and was up at the wire to prevail. KENAI BOB was well placed while two wide, then continued to stalk the leader into the far
turn, gained the lead mid stretch but gave way to an inside rival in the end. GOLD PILOT settled along the inside, saved ground on the far turn to rally four
wide in the stretch but was not enough. QUARTERBACK DAK chased the pace from the inside, made a mild bid on the far turn but was no threat. WITT'S
TAQUITO chased the leader three to four wide down the backstretch into the far turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ITSONLYMONEYHONEY was mid pack, racing along the rail in the third flight, angled out at the head of the stretch and closed fast to get up for the win.
AMERICAN COALMINER made the lead away from the gate, but faltered in late stretch to hold on for place. RELIANT stalked the pace from the inside,
then rallied up the rail to get up for show. COLORATURA was near the front, going two wide, then rallied down the lane, but hung late. GOOD LIQUOR was
mid field, going four wide and made a mild bid but it was not enough. LATE NITE MUSIC raced in the third flight, three wide and had an even effort. AVARIE
had no early foot, three wide and passed tiring rivals. ESPERANZA ROSE was near the back, two wide and failed to fire. ALL AFLUTTER showed no early
speed, three wide and failed to respond. VICENZA GOLD was mid pack, going three wide, and faded in the stretch drive.
