OVERLY CRITICAL settled in the two and three paths the first turn, challenged into the backstretch and took the lead nearing the three eighths pole,
contested the edge two deep on the far turn and dug in determinedly to draw clear of STREET LAMP through later yards. The latter took over nearing the
first turn and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the turn, was met toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantatge
nearest the rail on the turn and continued on gamely to mid-stretch before relenting. ROCKIN THE PALACE settled in the two and three paths the first turn,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened in the lane. STEAL THE CASH saved early ground, bid leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and passed rivals in the lane. NEVER FOR SPEIGHT drafted Street Lamp into the first turn and
settled close leaving the turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path of the far turn. GORUN stalked the early pace two
deep, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but faded into the far turn. I WAS RUN NAN was through early.

URKILLINGMEBETH stumbled and made contact with Imagoodchatterbug leaving the gate, settled in the three path the first turn then bid leaving the three
eighths pole, progressed steadily in the four path of the far turn and dug in widest to take over and draw clear later yards. LADY KAZA angled to the inside
and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole and put COURAGEOUS GRACE away leaving the far turn, dug in through the

JACK THE RIPPER (FR) exchanged contact with Lunar Image leaving the gate, took the lead and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under
pressure past the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and was steadily encouraged to widen. AWESOME BUZZ tapered in to stalk two deep,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then dueled through the stretch to maintain second. JUNGLE WARRIOR rated
close off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the stretch duel
for second. PAINT MUSIC FOR ME rounded the opening turn about the four path and settled into the backstretch, started a bid toward the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the three path and showed little in the lane. MINE TO HOLD rounded the first turn in the three path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little in the lane. ELEVATED FOREVER showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
SILKY SERENA engaged in close chase through the backstretch, ran three wide on the turn and dug in from the head of the lane to get up the final yards.
LUCYLOU WHO pressured the pace inside, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn, took the lead toward the top of the stretch and
dug in with a slim advantage, but was caught in the final yards. FANCY HER UP set a pressured pace and contested the edge two deep on the turn, was
met approaching the top of the lane and outfinished in the duel through the stretch, though, remained a close factor. WHALE OF A TIME was reluctant to
load, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn, drifted into the stretch but finished evenly. CHANGE THE WORLD gave chase
inside, ran at the rail on the turn then flattened stride later yards. SENECA ROCKS gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the six path and could only
close the gap in the lane. GHOSTLY SQUALL gave chase toward the outside, ran in the five path of the turn and could only close the gap in the stretch.
OFFICER CALLY hopped from the gate and was very slow getting into stride.

PARTY MONSTER rated close off the rail, bid leaving the three eighths pole, steadily improved off the rail on the far turn then dueled from the head of the
lane to get up the final yards. CHANNEL SCENT raced with the pace and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear toward the quarter pole, ran at
the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady encouragement through the final furlong but was caught in the closing yards. MY BRIDGET VERDOT broke out
to make contact with Bantam Rooster then settled inside, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then flattened
inside the eighth pole. SUPERSTASIA stalked from the three path, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the five path of the far turn
then weakened leaving the turn. BOTTLE COURAGE broke a step slow and dropped well off the pace saving ground, then bid only mildly leaving the three
eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail. SHESAHUMBLEHUSTLER broke inward and made contact with BANTAM ROOSTER, rounded the
opening turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response through the backstretch. BANTAM ROOSTER was jostled repeatedly at the
break, came through the first turn about the five path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. CHOSEN MISS broke a
step slow and saved ground. MARY BROWN raced with the pace and dueled from the seven sixteenths pole, but dropped back approaching the quarter
pole and weakened off the rail on the far turn.
