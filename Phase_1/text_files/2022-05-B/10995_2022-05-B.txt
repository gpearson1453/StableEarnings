SOUPER CATCH was rated off the runaway pacesetter, made a three wide bid in hand on the turn and quickly assumed command, then drew off in the
stretch under heavy crop urging to prove much the best. O K GAME ON was reserved early, three wide on the backstretch, made a three wide move on the
turn to chase the winner into the lane, proved to be no match for that rival, second best despite lugging in through the furlong grounds. VOUCH sent to the
front and drew off down the backstretch, then was headed nearing the quarter pole and gave way. THE ANGRY MAN was reserved on the inside, angled
out leaving the turn and had no response.
