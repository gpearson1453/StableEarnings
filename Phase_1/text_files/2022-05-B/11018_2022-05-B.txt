urging. KAZ SWEET HEIST raced six wide entering the first turn, settled off the rail, off the pace, moved up at the quarter pole, came two wide into the lane,
rallied past midstretch and finished well for second. CASSATION bobbled at the break, set the pace on the inside, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely
inside in the stretch run and then yielded. FOREVER CHOCOLATE stalked the pacesetter racing close up early, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled
between rivals and weakened. A LOOKER raced four wide early, then settled off the pace inside, was asked on the far turn and failed to respond. STEEL

kicked clear nearing the furlong marker and then was kept to the task. AMERICAN DAY raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, rallied on the
rail in the stretch run and finished willingly. FORWARDLY was off a step slow, tracked on the inside, chased the leaders on the far turn, angled out for the
drive, rallied mildly and held on for third. ROCK THE STARS raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up three or four wide on the far turn, came five wide into
the lane and rallied outside in the stretch. KING TSUNAMI was bumped soon after the start, raced two wide off the pace, lacked a rally and finished evenly.
KINGDOM ON PAWS raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly on the rail. VERBIER raced off the pace inside, chased two wide on the far turn, came
four wide into the stretch and had no rally. SPLENDID SUMMER was bumped soon after the start, set the pace on the inside, was pressured on the
