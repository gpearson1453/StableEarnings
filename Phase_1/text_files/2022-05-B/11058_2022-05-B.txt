Footnotes
CRAFTY HEAT showed good early speed to set the early pace from the inside and held gamely in the drive under strong handling. BEAR DEN stalked the
pace, moved up four widen near the three sixteenths pole and closed in on the leader in the final stages. LEDOUX WHAT IT DO stalked the early pace,
raced four wide through the upper stretch, angled in and had not enough in the drive. ROGUE BOY settled off the early going, raced four wide through the
far turn and had no response in the drive. VISONARY STAR stalked the early pace, dropped back nearing the far turn, raced widest through the lane and
never was a factor.

Footnotes
AWESOME SUNSET settled off the early pace, moved up near the inside in the drive and finished well to edge clear under strong handling. TAKE CHARGE
GAL stalked the pace, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. WIREWIREWIRE pressed the early pace, took command down
the backstretch, shifted out five wide into the lane and weakened a bit the final eighth of a mile. DO ME A FAVOR showed good early speed from the inside
and weakened in the drive. TIC TOC TOCCET settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. ARKANSAS
INVASION stalked the pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no late response. FATEFULLY YOURS was off slowly, raced far back and
never was a factor.
