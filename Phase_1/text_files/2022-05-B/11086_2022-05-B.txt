BLACK PANDA took a quick lead and rated the early pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the turn
and was steadily handled in the lane. BALLYMENA pressured the pace from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the turn off the rail and ran evenly in the
stretch. LUNAR NOTION veered sharply outward across the path of Noble Present leaving the gate, gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail, then
flattened in the lane. HURRICANE DIRECTOR gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn, drifted into the lane and flattened stride. PRINCESS MIA ROSE
gave chase, ran in the five path of the turn and showed little in the lane. NOBLE PRESENT was shut off and taken up leaving the gate, chased the early
pace outside then saved ground on the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Lunar Nation, lodged by the rider of Noble Present,
and as a result, disqualified the former to last place for closing off the path of the latter leaving the gate.

RUNAWAY MONET stalked the earlier pace inside, checked off the heels of Unrequited Love past the seven eighths pole and settled off the pace, started a
bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. MADY ROSE was
bumped outward and into Unrequited Love leaving the gate then settled off the pace in the three and four paths, picked up the chase nearing the three
eighths pole, took the lead two deep past the quarter, was steadily handled leaving the far turn but was caught flattening stride late stretch. HOLLY'S
PERSUASION became anxious in the gate and settled well back off the rail the opening half mile, eased out with a bid into the backstretch, rounded the far
turn about the four path and came along for third later yards. UNREQUITED LOVE was bumped off stride leaving the gate, closed to the front midway on
the opening turn then angled in past the seven eighths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught at the
rail into the far turn and flattened stride in the lane. TOOLEGITTOQUIT broke outward and made contact with Mady Rose then settled off the rail, picked up
the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.

hold on. HE'S NOT CURLY settled off the rail on the first turn, bid into the backstretch and ran four wide on the far turn, dug in from the head of the stretch
to take second the final jump and was gaining on the winner. BROTHER SKYE rated off the pace inside on the opening turn, gave chase nearing the three
eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn then outfinished in the duel through the stretch. ANOTHER VICTORY broke in and bumped Bucked Tooth then
rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three path the far turn then flattened stride the final sixteenth.

evenly through the lane. TIZ AUCTION TIME was bumped leaving the gate then closed to contention and stalked two deep, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole then faded through the far turn. BUCKED TOOTH was bumped inward and into Tiz Auction Time leaving the gate, stalked in the three path the
