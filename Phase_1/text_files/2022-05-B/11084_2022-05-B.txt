Footnotes
URANIUM bumped an inner rival at the start, set the pace along the inside, showed the way from a pair of pressing rivals into the turn, repelled CELESTIAL
GRACE's bid passing the three sixteenths pole, shook clear in upper stretch, and held sway. ROYAL HARRY tracked in the four to five path around the turn,
then stayed on outside of foes through the lane to prove second best. CELESTIAL GLAZE stalked three wide, inched closer to press around the turn, vied
two wide entering the lane, but was repelled in upper stretch, gave way, but saved show late. READYSEEKGO chased two wide and from between horses,
pressed under urging at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with his front-running counterparts approaching the five sixteenths pole, got outkicked
for show by an outer rival in upper stretch, shifted course outwardly, then kept on in the late stages, but missed reaching show. STAFF SERGEANT took
bumps from rivals on either side at the start, raced far back in the two path, and moved up between horses in the final furlong. T VILLE laid off of the pace in
the four path around the turn, and made little impact. SIR BITESALOT broke a step slowly, took the turn in the five path while towards the rear, and failed to
factor. CAJUN BAYOU bumped an outer rival at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MIGHTY FROSTED trailed in the three path
and never got involved. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
REDDINGTON set a pressured pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. REFUAH tracked the pace three wide, was no match for the winner but
stayed on to be clearly second best. AGARRAMESIPUEDES saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. SHA TIN chased the pace two wide,
angled four wide nearing the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. UNION OF THOUGHTS broke outwardly, chased the pace three wide was through early.
FAST FLIGHT pressed the winner two wide and retreated through the lane. SOCIAL EMPIRE ducked in and unseated the rider soon after the start and
walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT IN THE CHUTE AND TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
KING THEO tracked four wide, ranged up entering the far turn, bid for the lead in the three path with three furlongs to go, vied between horses turning for
home as outer foes made bid, sparred inside of LONG BEACH KIC entering the lane, exchanged a pair of bumps with that rival approaching the furlong
grounds while clinging to an advantage, and edged clear thereafter. LONG BEACH KID laid off of the pace four wide, gained around the far turn to bid for
the lead between horses turning for home, vied with an inner KING THEO entering the lane, shared blame in bumping with that foe twice in upper stretch,
then failed to keep pace with that rival at the furlong grounds before safely holding place. PAPA HONOR saved ground far off of the pace, improved turning
for home, shifted two wide in upper stretch, and stayed on between horses to claim show entering the final sixteenth. CATCHING FISH tracked three wide,
but was outmoved by outer rallying rival around the far turn, got floated four wide turning for home, and improved between horses. STAGE READY broke
inwardly, trailed in the two path, then moved up in the lane. PLATO rushed to the lead into the first turn, shifted inwardly while almost clear of ASK FOR
BODE in the early stages of that bend, managed a clear advantage down the backstretch, met a trio of bids around the far turn, and weakened entering the
lane. PARLOR got hung out five wide while off of the pace early on, gained five wide around the far turn to bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with
the top two entering the lane, and tired. FARLEY tracked in the two path, but failed to keep pace with the leaders while in the three path turning for home,
and lacked a re-rally. POCO CHARLIE saved ground off of the pace, but was outrun. ASK FOR BODE showed the way early on, steadied when PLATO
crossed over while clearing, stalked that loose leader from the two path, but was outmoved by outer rivals around the far turn, and weakened.

Footnotes
SANDPIPER MEMORIES broke a bit outwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked two wide, tucked to the inside approaching the far turn to stalk the
leaders, loomed a danger behind the top pair turning for home, split those rivals entering the lane, drove clear in upper stretch, and held sway from an outer
rallying rival late. STREAKING GREY was pinched between horses soon after the start without being severely costed position, settled far back in the two
path, steadied behind rivals in to the first turn, picked up stride four to five wide around the far turn, sustained his charge while hanging on her left lead in
upper stretch, changed over leaving the furlong grounds while bidding for place, and secure that position while chasing the clear leader home. CINDY'S
SONG bumped an inner rival at the start, stalked the dueling pair from the inside around the first turn, shifted outwardly down the backstretch, took aim
outside of the leader around the far turn, but was outkicked while being brushed by an inner foe entering the lane, and kept on between horses late. KIZZY
dueled for the lead two wide, inherited a clear advantage into the far turn when her inner counterpart faltered, but proved no match for a bidding foe in upper
stretch, and gave way through the final furlong. CHICA BOOM settled far back in the four to three path, moved forward while tracking in hand turning for
home, lugged inwardly behind the leading group in upper stretch, altered course out at the furlong grounds, and stayed on between horses. ROSA STAR
laid off of the pace in the three to two path, cut the corner under a drive entering the lane, but only managed to chase along the rail thereafter. BRAMBLE
BUSH broke through the gate pre-race, then failed to factor. SUMTING RIGHT tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch,
chased from the three to four path turning for home, but faded in midstretch. CALIFORNIA GIGI shied from an inner rival leaving the gate, then steadied at
the back of the back into the first turn, trailed in the five to three path around that bend, then in the five path around the far turn, and failed to factor.
HONORARY GUEST was hard to load, raced off of the pace in the four to three paths, then in the five path around the far turn, and made little impact.
ALEXANDRA AM I bumped an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead along the inside, but weakened into the far turn, and stopped. DUE TO A TIMER
MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, RUN-UP DISTANCE IS UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
KHOZY MY BOY stalked the pace two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. AMPERSAND was off slow, edged closer three
wide around the turn and rallied for the place. CHUCKY vied inside for six furlongs, was no match for the winner and lost second late. SEPTEMBERTEN
lacked early speed, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened. ROAN MOUNTAIN saved ground off the pace, swung five wide turning for home
and lacked the needed rally. TUWAIM vied two wide down the backstretch and was through after a half. DEMURELY chased the pace two and three wide
and came up empty in the lane. BRACCIO DI FERRO played no factor while racing three wide.
