HIT ONE OUT was forwardly placed early on, raced along the inside throughout and held gamely to be clear under steady handling. CRAZY LOVER
tracked the leader down the backstretch, moved up to challenge nearing the five sixteenths pole, raced two to three deep in the lane and finished second
best. BACKSTAGE BUD broke awkwardly, was coaxed along early down the backstretch to press the pace and tired in the stretch run. DUBBED IN
SEATTLE broke to the outside and never was a factor.

RAPID EXPANSION stalked the pace, moved up four wide through the far turn to challenge the leaders and just got up in his final strides under all out
pressure. OKIE FREEZE showed good early speed to set the pace along the inside, dug in deep stretch and just missed in a game effort. SWORD OF
GOLD stalked the pace early, made a good rail bid in the drive and closed in well late. EURO TRACKING stalked the pace, raced near the inside through
the far turn, angled five wide through the upper lane and showed good late interest. TRUE DOMINUS pressed the early pace while racing between rivals
and weakened a bit in the final stages. CHARM THE LADIES was off very slow, lost a considerable amount of ground, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and had not enough in the drive. HAMMER DOWN settled off the early pace, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and had no late
response.
