Footnotes
DANJERUS STORM settled off the leaders, bid between rivals three wide late on the turn, cleared under steady handling. TATAS JOE MARK was coaxed
forward inside to set a pressured pace, came off the rail later on the turn, was no match for the winner. NACHO GRANDE was forwardly-placed pressing the
pace from outside, drifted five wide late on the turn, kept on in the lane. ARBITRO chased two to three wide, offered no late threat. LADIES SISTER chased
from outside, failed to rally. CHARLIENE broke awkwardly and steadied, was never near enough to threaten. SKIDDISH KIZ shifted in early and was not a
factor.

MCCLASSIC broke awkwardly, settled at the rear racing off the rail, swung four wide turning for home and drove past inside the final sixteenth. BLUE SKYE
JADE prompted the early pace two wide, dueled inside a foe but off the fence, was no match for the winner. MEMORY TAKER stalked the early pace three
wide, dueled with the leader on the far turn, had no extra. BOOMER WHO shifted in early, saved ground and was never a threat. ROUSING RUBBLE vied
inside, switched out after a half, dropped back two wide on the far turn, tired.

ATLANTIC FROG tracked in behind two wide early, swung out four wide late on the far turn, ran along for show honors. FANTASTICALLY FINE vied inside
early, switched out three wide past the three-sixteenths once overtaken, continued to weaken. JASMINE WHO saved ground near the rail but mostly in the

first turn, passed a couple tired rivals in the stretch. TURQUOSIE MONSTER chased briefly two wide, dropped back moving out three to four wide, tired.

Footnotes
DESERT SPIRIT prompted the pace two wide, edged clear turning for home and held sway. CATTY DOM set the earl pace inside, continued to track the
leader to the three-sixteenths then shifted out three wide, kept on in the stretch. CHARITY WATER settled inside on or just off the rail, advanced late on the
far turn but had no extra for the drive. REBEL RYETTE bumped a rival at the start, raced four wide on the turns, was within striking distance late on the far
turn but had no late kick. MISS JAX improved position after going two to three wide. BULLDACIOUS KROME was bumped at the break,
forwardly-positioned chasing outside four wide early, weakened. LOADED GUN shifted off the inside to the three to four path into the first turn, had no rally.
JAZZ DIVA broke a step slowly and was in tight, raced off the fence in the three path early, was never a threat. DUKE CITY KITTY raced close up inside just
off the rail early, dropped back and faded.
