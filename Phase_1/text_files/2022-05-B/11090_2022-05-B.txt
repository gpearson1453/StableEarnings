Footnotes
CANDY'S LITTLE TIP was away in good order and hustled along in close pursuit, chased two wide in striking distance around the turn then battled for the
lead with EAST MOON LAKE into the upper stretch, dug in determinedly under pressure a furlong out and edged away. EAST MOON LAKE sped to the
lead at the start and dictated terms by a narrow advantage around the turn, fought back inside of CANDY'S LITTLE TOP in the upper stretch, got overtaken
by the winner leaving the furlong marker and had to settle for second best. NOTORIOUS NICK dwelt at the start and spotted the field several lengths,
responded gamely under urging and moved up into striking distance mid-way around the turn, vied three wide into the upper stretch then came up tired a
furlong out. GAME DAY DECISION hustled along in range in early stages, flattened along the inside around the turn then shifted out four wide into the upper
stretch and had no late response. RUNNING ALEX'SBAND lacked speed and trailed in the back, came two wide into the upper stretch and never
threatened. JERRYS PRIDENJOY showed brief response in early stages then steadily faded.

DRILL'S LI'L MAN took over the lead in opening strides and continued to hold a narrow advantage into the turn, given cue turning for home, had plenty left
in reserve and finished going away. FIVE O ONE was allowed to settle in early stages, angled out approaching the upper stretch, launched a four wide bid a
furlong out and got up late for place. NEWS BOX was forwardly placed racing just off the leader, chased up close around the turn, sustained three wide bid
into the lane and got edged late for place. KNOCKS BIG THIRST raced three deep off the top pair around the turn, stayed on three to four wide into the
upper stretch then ran on evenly in late stages. BROTHER AARON raced in contention along the rail around the turn, sustained inside bid to the furlong
marker then flattened out. DARK HEDGES chased between rivals in the second flight around the turn then weakened in the lane.

ELLE'S TOWN quickly cleared the lead and angled inside, showed the way around the turn, coaxed two wide into the upper stretch, had more left in reserve
and finished clear. BLINKERS raced off the early pace, came three to four wide into the upper stretch, responded under left handed pressure and rallied for
place. EURO ME tracked the leader along the rail around the turn, launched a two wide bid turning for home, sustained steady response and prevailed for a
share. MISS MELODY stalked the pacesetter into the turn, given cue three wide into upper stretch and failed to kick on. CATECHISM was ridden along the
inside around the turn, kept under pressure just off the inside in the upper stretch and had no late response. KASSERINE PASS chased two wide around
the turn then retreated in the upper stretch.

ANGEL'S MELODY sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held clear around the turn, dug in under left handed pressure in the final furlong and held
sway. SHESABIDFORMIDABLE hustled up along the inside around the turn, lacked room and brushed with SHIPS JEWEL in the upper stretch, got clear a
furlong out and finished second best. EBONY PEARL raced off the early pace, launched a five wide bid in the upper stretch and finished with good
response. SHIPS JEWEL was forwardly placed three wide in pursuit around the turn, continued a two wide bid and brushed with with
SHESABIDFORMIDABLE in the upper stretch then flattened out. ADD IT ALL UP was ridden along two to three wide into the stretch and lacked a needed
rally. PAPA'S SECRET lacked speed, trailed in early stages and failed to move into close contention. READY TO GET LOUD raced up close three wide
around the turn and faded in the lane.
