SUNBRIGHT tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied smartly two wide entering the final turn, quickly
assumed command midway through the turn, and was never threatened late. WALKINTHEWALK away well, but was allowed to settle well off the early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished willingly six wide in deep stretch to
get up for the place. SKY FACTOR broke sharply and rushed to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace in the run down the
backstretch and into the final turn, was quickly overhauled by SUNBRIGHT midway through the turn, and was outfinished late for the place. HEART OF
TEXAS away alertly, but ducked in leaving the chute and was taken in hand and dropped back to trail entering the first turn, raced five wide at the back of
the pack in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive while unable to make a
serious late impact. DO YOU WANNA GO stalked the leader from along the rail entering the backstretch, struggled to keep in striking position in the run to
the final turn, continued to save ground into the turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon. FULLY LENT tracked the pacesetter into
the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, continued into the final turn from just off the rail, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
FORT LANGLEY stalked the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched his bid three out from the rail
entering the final turn, collared the leaders leaving the turn and quickly assumed command, and drew clear in the lane under confident handling.
COULTERBERRY settled well off the dueling leaders while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering the final
turn, and continued gamely through the lane while finishing three out from the rail to get up for the place. SLEW'S DA BOSS unhurried early while dropping
back to trail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the drive to get up for a share. MCMURPHY
away alertly and raced to the lead while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, seta pressured pace in the run to the final turn, continued his pace
battle from along the rail into the final turn, was overtaken entering the lane, and outfinished late. ZERO DOWN was squeezed and pinched soon after the
start, but recovered to gain a tracking trip two out from the rail through the first turn, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backstretch, continued
three wide into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. FREE FOR SURE away well and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground
at the rail, continued to save ground int the final turn, but failed to respond when called upon. BLACK METAL broke sharply and pressed the pace from the
outside of MCMURPHY entering the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that foe in the run down the backside and through the final
turn, but faded in the late stages.

MISS THE HYPE stalked the leaders into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid from along the inside entering the final turn,
was never a threat to the winner, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. SERENGETI'S SUNSET settled off the early pace while racing two
wide into the backstretch, rallied from just off the rail entering the final turn, but needed more when called upon. KAPALUA CANDY away alertly and raced
to the lead from along the rail entering he first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside, opened a clear advantage approaching the final turn,
and widened her advantage through the final furlong while being ridden out late. CHICA HERMOSA broke sharply and tracked the leader into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide into the final turn, while losing touch of the winner, and battled gamely through the lane to
secure the place. DRILL BABY DRILL away well and stalked the leader into the backstretch while being carried four wide, rallied three wide into the final
turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon over the final furlong. KAY'S KITCHEN was fractious prior to the start, and raced five wide
through the first turn while drifting to the back of the field, began to gain momentum while racing one out from the rail entering the final turn, and finished
with late interest two wide in the drive.

AIRAFFAIR away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the
backside and through the final turn, shook clear of his pace rival entering the lane and quickly drew clear to prove much the best. HARVEST DAY broke
sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of AIRAFFAIR in the run down the backstretch, continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival
through the final turn, was unable to match strides with that foe leaving the turn, but battled on well to prove second best. ATOMIC HAZE away well and was
allowed to settle off the contested early pace while saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, and
finished willingly three wide from between rivals in deep stretch to get up for a share. CAUSIN' HAVOC settled off the early pace while racing two out from
the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and finished five wide in the drive while needed more of a closing response. STAY
ALL NIGHT stalked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and finished three wide
in the drive while unable to mount a late bid. ACCEPT NO OTHER settled well off the early pace while racing five wide into the backstretch, continued with a
wide trip throughout, raced six wide through the final turn, and failed to make up ground while remaining wide in the stretch drive. TUXEDO was fractious
prior to the start, settled well off the early leaders while saving ground at the rail entering he backstretch, was asked for run from along the rail in the run
down the backside, but was unable to ever prove to be a factor.
