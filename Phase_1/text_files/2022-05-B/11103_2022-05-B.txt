Footnotes
LASSMAN prompted the pace while three wide, took the lead while still in hand three wide around the turn, opened up into the stretch and drew clear.
GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS set the pace inside, was cued when headed midway around the turn, tipped two wide at the eighth pole but was no match for the
winner. GHOST OF KHOZAN trailed early, made steady progress while three wide around the turn, shifted inside coming into the stretch and rallied. THE
SKIPSTER pressed between foes early, was hustled along to keep up while two wide around turn, tipped three wide into the stretch, but finished evenly.
CONNECTING tracked the leading trio, was ridden along the four path into the stretch, but flattened. KERANOS rated from the rail but never threatened.
SKATING DATE was slow into stride and never a factor.

TAPPIN FOR GLORY trailed in the two path early, made steady progress while racing inside along the turn, accelerated through an opening on the rail and
drew clear. YABBA DABBA DUDE stalked the pace two wide, floated into the eight path rounding the turn, but ran on for place. GILDED WARRIOR raced in
mid pack inside, tipped into the six path into the stretch, but was even in stretch. CLASSY SOLUTION pressed inside, drifted into the seven path into the
stretch, but was tired. MEGA MILLIONS raced well back and inside, hustled along the three path around the turn, but had no response. VEGAS LIFE set the
pace three wide, was roused in the two path heading around the turn, but was empty.

continued to run on for place. MIDNIGHT TRICK raced in mid pack from the three path, was driven four wide into the stretch, and improved for show. TWO

MY MAN VITO stalked from the three path early, took over while two wide rounding the far turn, and opened up in the stretch. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY
tracked the pace two wide, raced in the three path heading into the stretch, but was second best. B B BAD rated well of the pace inside, was ridden two
wide around the far turn, and improved in the stretch to show. SAGRADA RAY set the pace, lost the lead while saving ground rounding the far turn, and was
tired in the stretch. MINECRAFTER trailed and was never a factor. LIVEFORTHESONG raced in mid pack early from the three path but was empty coming
into the stretch.

Footnotes
VIOLET JESSOP tracked along the rail, made a sweeping three wide bid to take over around the far turn, opened up into the stretch and was much the
best. PRIME COAT chased inside, was ridden along while saving ground along the far turn, and ran on for place. ANAHIYA'S DREAM set the pace, was
cued while racing inside midway around the far turn, and held show. PENSIVELY rated from the rail, was ridden along inside on the far turn, tipped into the
two path for the stretch but was empty. SAINTS VICTORY pressed while two wide early, was hustled along to keep up around the far turn, and flattened.
LAVENDEL stalked the pacesetters from the two path, was three wide heading into the stretch but was tired. MISS STREET was well back and done early.
MARK WITH AN E broke open gate and was held at the start. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE START OF THE RACE AND MARK WITH
AN E WAS DECLARED A NON-STARTER DUE TO AN UNFAIR START.

pace two wide, raced three wide coming into the stretch, but was even down the lane. RISK MODEL led early under a snug hold, was hustled two wide
heading into the stretch, but was tired. IRAZU pressed the pace early but was done after a half. CECILITA was off slow, trailed, and never a factor.

Footnotes
LUCKBEALADYTONIGHT race off the pace two wide, was roused while three wide rounding the far turn, and kicked clear down the stretch. SUNDAY
SWAGGER trailed while racing in the three path early, was driven along the four path rounding the far turn, and ran on for place. MARAMA tracked inside,
was hustled in the three path rounding the far turn, and held show. SHO U RIGHT stalked from the two path, bid while two approaching the quarter pole, but
flattened. ROONEY rated inside but was never a factor. LADY TIZMO was quick to the lead but was done rounding the far turn.
