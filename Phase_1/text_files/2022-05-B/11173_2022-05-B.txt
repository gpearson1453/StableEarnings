Footnotes
GHAALEB'S MAGIC soon took the advantage and was clear of the others after the first eighth, showed the way in hand, was roused once straightened for
the drive and maintained full control while kept to task until the final seventy yards. LIL BIT TIPSEY progressed from outside to take over second four wide
on the bend, angled in some entering the stretch, was all out, no match for GHAALEB'S MAGIC but clearly best of the others. G CITY WARRIOR broke
alertly, was soon chasing GHAALEB'S MAGIC, altered out some midway on the backstretch trying to keep a clear path, brushed several times with MISS
LEARJET, took the turn two wide then flattened out for the stretch run. MISS LEARJET raced in contention while in close quarters between horses, brushed
several time with G CITY WARRIOR on the backstretch, did not keep up while in a narrow path on the turn and also had no late bid. HOLD THE SPENDING
was a factor from inside on the backstretch but yielded after three furlongs. BOWS N LACE failed to menace in a wide trip.

Footnotes
WILDCAT BOBBIE was sent to the lead then allowed to relax, roused again upper stretch, lengthened command and continued to open up while ridden out
the final furlong. MOON PIES IMAGE broke alertly and inward, was soon chasing WILDCAT BOBBIE from outside, was challenged for second on the turn,
edged ahead again for the place inside the last eighth, was all out and held off COWGIRL FRANKIE. The latter trailed well off the early speed, picked up her
pace three wide on the turn, fanned out further for the stretch run, passed tired ones, fought for second the last sixteenth but lacked the extra needed.
DOLLY'S LINE prominent from inside, was boxed in as she closed the gap on the bend, got through two wide entering the stretch and flattened the final
eighth. DELTA LADY raced in contention early, was three wide on the turn, began to yield after four furlongs, angled in upper stretch and continued to
gradually fade.

ROAD GAME rated from the inside on the backstretch, angled out into the bend, advanced from outside, rallied under a drive in the lane, took the lead with
a sixteenth left then drew away while kept to urging until near the wire. R H SMOAKEM broke on top and was quickly clear of the rest, put to a drive in the
stretch, no match for ROAD GAME the final sixteenth but clearly best of the rest. LONG STATION in contention on the backstretch, moved to the inside
after two furlongs, failed to keep up on the turn, swung out again nearing the quarter pole, came four wide into the lane, lodged a mild bid and gained third
late. HELLOFAGUY soon trailed, saved ground taking the turn, angled out for a clear path upper stretch and showed late interest. GONEGHOST was
prominent from outside, two wide leaving the bend then flattened out for the drive. DR. LIECHTY helped prompt the early pace, took the rail on the turn and
began to yield before finishing a half mile.

Footnotes
MY MORNING GAL bumped shortly after the break, was kept close outside AUNT STELLA, drifted out some as she was roused leaving the bend, took the
advantage inside the final furlong and held off AROSE FOR LYLA under steady handling. AROSE FOR LYLA chased from inside, reached contention along
the rail on the bend, threatened midstretch, drifted out briedly under left-handed pressure with seventy yards left, was corrected and closing in on MY
MORNING GAL late. AUNT STELLA fractious in the gate, broke through her gate before the start, was reloaded, broke on top and was quickly clear once
the race began, floated out some entering the stretch then gradually wore down from between rivals inside the last eighth. PRANCIPANTS advanced three
wide on the turn, lost some ground fanning outside MY MORNING GAL into the lane and found best stride too late. RONAN soon trailed, advanced from
inside on the bend, fanned out behind PRANCIPANTS for the stretch run and had no late bid. DIAMOND GUCCI not far off the inside taking the turn, had
little to offer for the stretch run. HIDDEN FIGURE lugged in some to bump MY MORNING GAL from the rear after the start and showed little thereafter.

Footnotes
CITY POSITION bumped shortly after the start, shared the lead in hand outside PEACOCK MAN, was roused leaving the bend, edged ahead in the lane, all
out between rivals and held sway. STUMP well placed from inside, was blocked on the turn, swung out three wide to make his bid entering the stretch, took
over second inside the final sixteenth then could only just hold his position in the waning yards. ABSTRACT PAYNTER without early speed, lost ground
three to five wide through the bend, made a strong move the last eighth, was too late but caught PEACOCK MAN for third. PEACOCK MAN broke on top,
disputed the pace between foes, gained the inside on the turn then slowly wore down for the drive. RADIANT CASTLE bumped with CITY POSITION shortly
after the break, chased from off the inside and had no late bid. LINE OF DENHAMS raced in contention while toward the outside in the early going, was
three then four wide taking the turn then flattened out for the stretch run. FIXICO failed to menace in a wide trip. VIRGA turned his head at the start, spotting
the rest of the field several lengths, was hustled along from inside but showed little in a ground-saving trip.

LAUDA SPEED stalked the early speed from outside, went for the lead three wide on the turn, moved ahead when asked upper stretch then drew away
under steady urging the last eighth. SHANGHAI POINT vied for the lead between rivals, bumped with NAUGHTY ALFRED into the turn, edged ahead two
wide on the bend, was no match for LAUDA SPEED when set down for the drive but proved easily second best. MKAR THE FAST gradually moved to the
inside in the early going, waited for a clear path on the turn, got through from inside leaving the quarter pole, took over third upper stretch then could only
hold his position. NAUGHTY ALFRED was hustled up to contest the pace inside SHANGHAI POINT, bumped with tatter into the bend, angled in some and
began to yield after three furlongs. BACKSHOT raced in contention from outside for a half mile, came four wide into the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
SAMARITA rated off the early speed and the rail, angled in to progress along the rail on the bend, fanned out behind MIND YOUR OWN entering the lane,
altered inside that one upper stretch, was all out and got up nearing the wire. MIND YOUR OWN bumped with DIAMOND STELLAR at the break, pressed
RENDLAKE from inside on the backstretch, altered outside the latter into the turn, gained the lead under urging between rivals, floated out some entering
the stretch, drew clear, was under steady urging the last furlong but outfinished. BETWEEN raced in contention from between horses, did not keep up from
path three on the turn, swung out behind TROUBLE FINDS ME into the lane, altered inside that one when a path opened midstretch, steadily advanced and
drew away for third inside the final furlong. TROUBLE FINDS ME altered out some leaving the chute trying to gain a clear path, bumped a couple times with
THINK BLUE, was prominent in tight quarters between horses on the backstretch and turn, was forced out some leaving the bend and flattened for the
drive. THINK BLUE bumped a couple times shortly after leaving the chute, helped prompt the pace racing widest, four wide on the turn, also forced out
some leaving the bend and faded widest in the lane. RENDLAKE displayed early speed just off the inside, took the rail and was overtaken on the turn and
gave way the final two furlongs. DIAMOND STELLAR soon trailed, saved ground and had little to offer when urged in the stretch. The riders of TROUBLE
FINDS ME and THINK BLUE lodged an objection alleging interference from MIND YOUR OWN leaving the quarter pole. After their review, the stewards did
not uphold both claims of foul.
