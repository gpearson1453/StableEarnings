TIME TWISTER in the second flight early off the inside, moved up to duel in the two path through the turn, remained on equal terms with that rival past the
furlong marker, larger advantage late, held the runner up safe in the final strides to prevail. STRUTTIN APRIORITY settled off the pace and the inside,
rallied through some traffic to be getting to the winner late. BULLETSREVENGE broke sharp, showed the way into the turn, dueled through the turn inside
the winner, continued to do battle with that one until less than a furlong remained then weakened a bit to slow some position late. SAMURAI ISLAND back
off the pace inside, saved ground through the turn, moving a bit closer inside the furlong marker, traffic a sixteenth out, modest interest in the waning strides
while remaining inside. BIG TIME BANDIT off a step slow, trailed most of the way, made little impact through the stretch while off the inside. MY PAL PINOT
forwardly placed along the inside, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
COROT broke with the leaders inside, chased the pacesetter in the two path into and through the the turn, three path for the drive, set down, collared the
leader late, enough left to withstand a late charge from the pair of runner ups in a determined effort. PRIZELESS last away, was outrun for three furlongs,
shifted out widest for the drive, finished with good energy well out in the course to be getting to the winner while earning a share of the place. HEZA
PRIORITY back off the pace inside, encountered some minor traffic in the turn while continuing to save ground, roused, responded with a late bid up the
inside, not enough for the win while dead heating for the second spot. ZCAT'S CHATAIN asked for some run leaving the gate, cleared late backstretch,
continued to show the way into the straight while coming off the inside a bit, responded when confronted on both sides inside the furlong grounds, proved
stubborn to the end. WHENTHEDOVESCRY lacked early foot, moved a bit closer when straightened for home, lacked a winning punch late while between
horses. WAR SONG within striking distance for three furlongs while racing outside, had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
BISPING broke alertly, soon clear, set the pace just off the inside, lugged in a bit past the furlong marker, was righted and held then increased advantage
under steady handling. FREE FROM GUILT broke in good order, chased the winner from the outside, drifted slightly as that rival was lugging in past the
furlong marker, could do little with that same foe late, clearly second best. TUCKER THE GRUMP reluctant to load, out out a bit to slightly bother HAPLESS,
raced back off the pace and the inside, came three wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to annex the show while not a threat to the top two. DREAMED I
AM FAST went one paced behind the top two, lacked a closing response in the drive, caught late for the show. REAL ACTION back off the pace, lacked a
closing response. HAPLESS off slow while bothered slightly, raced well wide, well back in failing to threaten.

J Z'S FIRST dropped inside to save some ground into the first turn to bother MSCHITCHATTOUR, continued to race unhurried up the backstretch, made a
good gain along the inside into the contention in the second turn, tipped out into the lane, split foes to challenge when straightened for home under clever
handling, proved best late under steady handling. HUSHED COURT ROOM broke on top, set a soft pace along the inside, responded when challenged by
the winner nearing midstretch, gave ground grudgingly to the wire, clearly second best. SHE'S MY PRIORITY in the second flight while racing outside,
remained within striking distance in the run up the backstretch, moved closer in the three path final turn, proved no match for the top two through the stretch.
MSCHITCHATTOUR broke out, steadied to trail early, bothered and steadied again when the winner came in entering the first turn, continued to trail, came
widest into the stretch to improve position with some belated interest. MY REBEL GIRL settled off the pace, came up empty for the stretch run. NINE LINE
BIND lacked speed, failed to menace in remaining back. SHANGHAI HETTY chased the runner up for over a half, stopped far turn, eased up late under the
wire.

SHIPPINGPORT broke out, bothered SNIVELING, straightened to set a pressured pace out of the chute, continued to show the way up the backstretch,
shook clear final turn, held sway under steady handling. SNIVELING bothered at the break, lacked speed, saved ground through the second turn, came out
then dropped back to the rail for the drive, finished with good determination to annex the place, no threat to the winner. ONE TIME GEM firmly raced at the
inside, moved closer after a half, also traversed the rail through the second bend, in the two path for the drive allowing the runner up the rail, outkicked for
the second spot by that rival. BIRTHDAY PARTY tracked the pace while inside early, in the two path up the backstretch while remaining closest to the two
leaders, came up empty for the stretch run. CALABASH pressed onto the main track, chased the winner the middle half mile, began to weaken in the far
turn. CITADEL in mid pack for five furlongs, gave way. JEHA remained always back.

HEI HEI CUSTIVITY took control just after the start, set all the pace, widened strongly through the lane under a hand ride to win ridden out in a sharp debut.
CECE WAVE broke on top, relinquished the advantage to the winner soon after, chased that one in the second flight from along the inside, proved no match
in the drive, well clear of the others. SCARLET STORM in the second flight off the inside, also proved no match in the drive while unable to keep up with the
runner up, finished best of the rest in saving the show. LATER LATERTIFFANY went one paced in lacking a response toward the inside. GEAUX VOTE last
away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
IRON IN THE FIRE broke on top, relinquished the advantage soon after, pressed the leader from the outside into the turn, between foes when still within
striking distance turning for home, kept coming late to prove best while under firm handling. JAMAICAN ME void of speed well out in the strip, swung five
wide when roused turning for home, closed with good energy down the middle of the strip while too late for the winner. BASEBALL LOVER away well, took
command inside the winner, led that one into the turn, continued to show the way into the stretch, shook off a brief bid from JANET'S DEVIL when
straightened for home and proved stubborn until late when unable to contain the top two. HOLIDAY DIAMOND lacked early foot, came three wide into the
lane, improved position with some mild late interest through traffic. JANET'S DEVIL forwardly placed while racing outside, crept closer and briefly lodged a
bid three wide entering the stretch, faltered the final furlong to lose several positions. QUARTER RAT in the second flight for a half, had little for the drive.
ADIEU LE CHAT also raced in mid pack for four furlongs and tired. XANTHUS WRATH off step slow, failed to threaten. IN A BIND hopped at the start to
begin awkwardly, remained always back. STAR AND A HALF in the main body while racing outside, four wide through the turn before backing up down the
stretch.

Footnotes
BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL vied three wide in the run up the backstretch, dueled on the outside into the stretch, held a narrow advantage past the furlong
marker and proved narrowly best at the end in a game effort. AUTUMN'S SUPER CED with the leaders out of the chute, vied up the backstretch closest to
the inside, dueled into the lane along the rail, extended duel to the wire, outkicked late. ORPHAN CREEK void of speed, came on the outside for the drive
four wide, staged a late run out in the strip to be in time for the show while getting to the top two. R T'S D'ORO behind the first flight outside, came three
wide into the lane, went evenly in the late going to be caught for the show. MORO PHAROAH underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, fell back to trail soon
after the start, continued to lag for a half, moved outside and staged mild middle move four wide late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance through the
stretch. SOULOLOGY moved off the inside, raced in mid pack in the two path, back to the rail midway on the turn, failed to mount a response in the drive.
RUN TO BLADE failed to menace. TOUGH START in the main body early, faded. BLUE RIDGE BOOGIE broke alertly, with the pace for almost four
furlongs between the top two, gave way early in the turn and continued to stop through the lane.
