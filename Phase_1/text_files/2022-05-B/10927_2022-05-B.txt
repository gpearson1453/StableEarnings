Footnotes
NOID eased out on the first turn and stalked into the backstretch, closed to the front three wide approaching the quarter pole, contested the edge through
the far turn, dug in to put Jacklighting away later yards and held on well. SLEW THE TURN saved ground on the first turn and was hemmed in entering the
backstretch, eased out at the half mile pole, bid toward the seven sixteenths, came through the far turn in the three path and finished well to take second
later yards. JACKLIGHTING stalked off the rail, challenged toward the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage on the far turn, dueled at even
terms in the upper stretch but relented later yards. TWILIGHT YEARS stalked the early pace inside, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail, eased out into the lane but showed little further. JACKSON MAN broke a step slow and rounded the opening turn about the
three path, left the turn outside, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and weakened. DOC ELM took
the lead at the three quarter pole, angled in on the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, gave up the lead
approaching the quarter pole and faded at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
CHARLIE POTATOES settled off the pace about the three path the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, was carried out and took the nod about the
five path into the lane, dug in determinedly to edge out the game effort of Quad Eights, and held on. DYNAMIC DAY saved ground on the first turn, bid
leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the three and four paths of the far turn, drifted to the six path leaving the turn, finished well to take second the final
strides and was gaining on the winner. QUAD EIGHTS raced with the pace three wide through the front stretch then rated a slim lead into the first turn,
came under pressure and dueled with the edge from the three eighths pole, drifted and was met leaving the turn but dug in gamely to deep stretch before
flattening stride. FIND YOUR BOAZ saved ground on the first turn, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path, left the turn
widest and finished well to pass rivals. MY CANDY BIZ settled off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far
turn near the rail then weakened. GOLDEN ANSWER raced with the pace inside through the front stretch, steadied into the first turn and settled close,
challenged at the seven sixteenths pole and factored from that point, but dropped back toward the head of the lane and weakened. COUNT THE SHELLS
raced with the pace between horses in the front stretch, kept close inside on the first turn but dropped back toward the seven sixteenths pole and faded. The
Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of Quad Eights for alleged interference through the backstretch, lodged by the rider of Golden Answer,
though, found no infraction.

Footnotes
LIL BUNNY set a pressured pace inside, rounded the turn at the rail, bore out making contact with TRUENO FUERTE leaving the turn but dug in under
steady handling to hold on. The latter pressured the pace two deep, contested at a close disadvantage through the turn, was forced out and bumped into
the stretch but recovered ground through later yards and finished well. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE exchanged contact with Night Flight leaving the gate and
gave chase racing wide, rounded the turn about the seven path and dug in through the stretch to take third under the wire. SWISS HORIZON pressured the
pace three wide, was forced outward leaving the turn then nipped from third under the wire. LIL PERFECT gave chase, rounded the turn about the three
path and ran evenly in the lane. MEDAL GENIUS gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn then flattened the final sixteenth. NIGHT FLIGHT exchanged
contact with Warriorinthehouse leaving the gate and dropped well back early, closed the gap through the backstretch, raced at the rail on the turn then
flattened stride. JU JU'S HEAT saved ground.
