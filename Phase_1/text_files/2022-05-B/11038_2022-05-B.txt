Footnotes
TIZZY JOJO was off to a clear lead soon after the start, raced in the two path while well clear and the rider peeking back, received minimal urging into the
lane and remained clear while in hand through the final eighth. TWIRLING JUSTICE chased the winner through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on
that one and settled for second best. PASSIONFORJUSTICE raced in the three path through the turn and into the lane, could not gain on the top ones while
remaining well clear of the next rival. MACHO JUSTICE brushed the gate while stepping in at the start, raced in the two path into the lane, dropped to the
rail inside the eighth pole and never was a factor. MEAN ELENITA raced along the inside into the lane, altered off the rail just inside the eighth pole when
another came over and never made an impact. GENERAL AFFAIR never a factor while near the rail through the turn and into the lane. THE RACE WAS
HAND-TIMED DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
BELLA BOLLE stumbled at the start then recovered quickly, raced on the lead through the turn, saw her advantage diminish in late turn and into the lane,
lost the lead when straightening, was on near even terms just inside the eighth pole then inched up late in a game effort. BROOKVILLE STORM chased the
pacesetter into the turn, bid in late turn, gained a short lead into the lane, dueled with the top one through the final eighth and could not keep her at bay.
MORE APPROVAL stepped in at the start and bumped rival, raced near the inside through the turn and into the lane then stayed on to gain the show spot
while not a threat to the top two. DANCE MONEY chased the pace from the two path through the turn and into the lane, weakened inside the eighth pole
and lost the show spot. QUICK AND EASY raced in the back while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the seven path and never was
a factor. VALSHEBA was bumped at the start, raced in the two path through the turn and never was a threat.

Footnotes
MAKER'S PLEASE set the pace on a clear lead through the turn, was challenged straightening in the lane by two others, continued with a short lead with a
furlong to go, cleared, drifted late and finished in the three or four path. JERICHO EXPRESS settled off the pace early, moved up quickly from the four path
through late turn, came into the lane three wide, loomed a threat outside the eighth pole, could not reel in the winner while gaining the place spot late. CHA
CHA LARRY chased the pace from the two path through the turn, bid two wide into the lane, was a serious threat with an eighth to go, continued in close
proximity between rivals into deep stretch then yielded to the top two. LET'S GO JOHN was bumped and angled to the rail at the start spotting the field
some four lengths, raced well back in the two path, came into the lane from the three path and moved up while not a serious threat. VICTOR'S SECRET
chased the pace from the three path through the turn, was close up nearing the quarter pole, came into the lane from the four path with aim on the top ones
then tired. INDY REBEL raced in the five to the four path through the turn and never factored. HOT N SWEATY stepped in at the start and bumped rival,
raced along the inside through the turn and into the lane and tired. TRAVELINJUSTICE was outrun while along the inside. A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO
THE STRETCH RUN FOUND NO REASON TO CHANGE FINISHING ORDER.

Footnotes
NOT A ROLE MODEL gained the lead into the first turn, set a dawdling pace while under some pressure to the outside, continued with a short lead into the
far turn, was asked for more leaving the turn and opened a clear and her largest advantage outside the eighth pole then held while under a measured drive.
CORIMA saved ground through the turns while never far back, bid into the lane and was gaining to the end while getting up for the place spot.
BICKERMENTS chased the pace from the three path through the far turn, came into the lane from the three or four path with aim on the winner then lacked
the needed closing response while losing the place spot late. SHESACLEVERJUSTICE raced in the two path through the turns, came into the lane from the
five or six path and finished with good energy while being photoed for a couple of closer spots. SKIPPINJUSTICE was unhurried while off the inside, moved
four wide through the turn, straightened in the seven path and showed good energy too late. AJIC JAY was in the three path through the turns, came into
the lane three wide and lacked a finishing kick. IMA N H LADY CAT pressed the winner two wide into the lane then was done after turning into the lane.
VENYATTA was along the inside throughout and never was a factor. WRAPPINJUSTICE was outrun while in the two path.

Footnotes
ARTIE'S RUMOR stalked the pace inside, angled to the three path at the quarter pole, rallied and drew off under mild urging. NOBRAG JUSTFACT stalked
the pace between foes, bid in the stretch and gained the place late. IAN GLASS dueled outside of a foe but couldn't last in the drive. HEMP HEMP
HURRAY was unrushed in the two path, then had a mild late bid. MYSTERY UNBRIDLED dueled inside but couldn't last in the stretch. GIVEMETWENTY
raced in the four path, then had no late bid. SPECTACULAR GEM saved ground to no avail. UPHOLD stalked the early pace in the three path, bid at the
three-eighths pole but faltered on the turn. EGO and HEZA HANDFUL were not factors.
