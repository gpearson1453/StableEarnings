NOW NOW MAN pressed the pace from the inside through the backstretch then went between horses at the end of the final turn and battled with DUDE
DROP KID in the final furlong to prove to be the best. DUDE DROP KID was well placed in the two path just off the leaders then took control after a half with
a clear lead but had to battle inside of NOW NOW MAN in the final furlong to be denied. GREY SLOAN saved ground through the final turn then angled out
three wide in the upper stretch but was no match for the top two. ZONG TOUGH was away well to set the early pace from the two path but gave way in the
upper stretch. ACTIFDASH went four wide into the first turn then tracked the leaders from the two path made a middle move and faltered. A STAR IS BORN
NOW trailed throughout and was never a threat.

Footnotes
O CHITA was hustled to the lead on the inside and drew off in upper stretch and drifted out but proved to be much the best. LIFE OF SATURDAYS roused
to press the pace from the three path drifted out five wide at upper stretch and couldn't match strides in the stretch drive. MARILYN'S MAGIC raced near the
back early then made a three wide rally to finish strong. PINTLALA chased the field early then moved four wide in upper stretch to have her best strides late.
BLULU was unhurried early and raced evenly. MISS CHECKMARK saved ground in the middle of the pace but was one paced. KEHEI KAT hopped at the
start then was rushed to contention and was through after a half.
