ROSA'S SOUL a step slow early surged outside on the turn taking a short lead into upper stretch drawing out late under a drive. IMA BARREL RACER off
slowly was well back early, rallied into upper stretch coming on late four wide to save place. SHE'S MISS ARTIE slow early lagged to upper stretch
mustering a mild rally there to outbid the others. HELLO MY HALO pressed the pace dueling on the turn extending on the inside down the lane wearing out
late. ZEENA'S RUSH played no factor. SPECIAL BLUE pressed early then weakened on the turn fading to upper stretch. PERFECT PEACH pressured
hard through the turn then wilted in upper stretch.
