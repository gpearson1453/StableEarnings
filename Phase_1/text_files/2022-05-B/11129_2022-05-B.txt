Footnotes
THE Z MAN broke sharply, pressed the pace outside a rival racing to the turn, then met the challenge of LEAD OFF nearing upper stretch to go clear under
firm encouragement. The latter stalked just off the first flight in the opening quarter, loomed three deep to strike the front with a quarter mile to go, drifted out
entering the lane and failed to sustain his momentum. MO MORE, urged inside the eventual winner disputing the pace through the backstretch into the turn,
gave way into upper stretch. PERIPATETIC settled outside foes in early stages, angled four wide entering the stretch but made no impression. BOSTON
WALLY tracked off the first flight between foes racing to the turn but faded nearing upper stretch. SHUWA FUNGA P was urged to a position tracking off the
first flight along the inside in the opening quarter but gave way early.

Footnotes
BOLD MINISTER broke readily, attended the pace three wide through the backstretch, pressed the issue on the turn to gain the advantage racing into upper
stretch and drove clear. SOUPER FORTUNE, urged between foes prompting the pace from the outset, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into
upper stretch but proved no match late. BRASKA, slow to gather stride, settled last in early stages, switched outside foes racing into the turn, angled to the
four path racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. GOLDEN STAR ROCK tracked the leaders along the rail from out of
striking distance, dropped back last entering the turn, swung wide racing into upper stretch while being roused to advance but had no rally. WARNING
LABEL tracked off the first flight between foes into the turn and faded in the drive. TWILITE LIASON, urged inside rivals disputing the pace from the outset,
gave way after three furlongs.

Footnotes
REINA DEL SUR, urged inside foes from the break, switched outside a rival nearing the backstretch to prompt that foe to the second bend, pressed the
issue on the far turn to gain a narrow advantage racing into upper stretch, was fanned three wide in the closing stages but edged forward under brisk
handling. NORA'S LEGACY, urged to the lead while angling to the inside once gaining a clear advantage on the first turn, dictated the pace on a narrow
advantage on the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner on the far turn to upper stretch, resisted that rival while shifting well off the
inside midstretch but proved only second best. MOM'S PASS, reserved in early stages while angling inwards, split foes midway through the backstretch
commencing a steady advance, angled to the rail racing into the far turn, then continued willingly in that path to late stages while closing the gap on the top
pair late. FULL SPEED ASTERN broke readily, shifted out three wide racing to the backstretch stalking just off the first flight but steadily faded racing into
the far turn. MERLIN'S SISTER, off a step slowly, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch and never seriously menaced. ME SAY SO angled to the
inside on the first turn tracking off the first flight but gave way early.

APART OF MY CHARM broke readily, sprinted clear of the field off the inside in the opening stages, steadily widened the advantage into upper stretch and
was kept to the task under firm encouragement. ELI'S GIRL tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening stages, shifted to the four path in
upper stretch and continued with interest to prevail for the place honors late. DANZIG STAR broke sharply, was held up between foes to drop well off the
leaders racing to the turn but made an effort in the closing stages to improve position between foes in the final furlong. MISSEN THE POINT, urged three
wide in the opening quarter pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, gave way into the lane. CHAOS MAGIC tracked the leaders inside rivals in second flight
racing to the turn, then gave way nearing upper stretch. WHITEROSE SPIRIT settled between foes in the last flight and failed to menace thereafter. MISS
TATER TOT broke a step slowly, tracked off the second flight inside rivals in early stages but never gained contention.

Footnotes
BENS MALICE switched outside foes to race four wide into the first turn tracking off the second flight, continued in that path to the far turn while steadily
advancing to contention, was fanned four wide racing into upper stretch while moving to challenge for command, went clear between calls leaving the
furlong marker and held HOLD THE SPICE on a safe margin under firm handling. The latter, off a bit slowly, settled last to the backstretch, gained position
between foes racing through the far turn, split foes four wide racing past the furlong marker and continued willingly to close the gap on the winner. LORING
PARK was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, gained position inside foes on the far turn, tipped off the inside entering the lane,
altered course three deep midstretch but continued with interest to gain position while earning a share. BUBBA BOB, forwardly placed prompting the
pacesetter to the backstretch, was urged to challenge that rival three deep in upper stretch but came up empty leaving the furlong marker. DIRECT ACTION
sped to the lead along the inside, dictated the pace to the far turn, was urged to widen the advantage nearing the stretch while shifting off the inside but
gave way between foes in upper stretch. TALENT AND TRICKS angled to the inside tracking off the first flight to the far turn, bid along the rail when
presented an opening in upper stretch but had no final kick. MYSTIFIER tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn but came up empty
nearing the lane. GABRIEL'S LEGEND tracked off the second flight between foes racing to the backstretch but offered no rally. TRI SPOT settled along the
inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground to the lane but lacked a closing response. OUT RUN'M, held up between foes in the last flight racing to the
first turn, never proved a threat.

MOST SANDISFACTORY, in touch with the pacesetter between rivals prompting that foe in the opening half, moved to wrest the advantage midway
through the far turn, then went clear through the stretch under firm encouragement. YAK was settled between foes dropping out last racing to the
backstretch, shifted outside foes on the far turn gathering momentum, was fanned six wide in upper stretch but found his best stride late to edge a rival for
the place honors. CHICORY BLUE tracked just off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the stretch while being
prompted to advance but was outkicked for second. SPIRIT MISSION, urged to the lead along the inside racing into the backstretch, dictated the pace on a
narrow margin to the far turn, then gave way nearing the lane. SIDE STREET DAVE, urged three wide prompting the pace to the far turn, gave way into the
lane. ANDREAS, a bit outpaced racing to the backstretch, never gained contention. UNBROKEN SONG, caught four wide racing through the first turn while
dropping out of striking distance, never mounted a serious challenge.

Footnotes
TWOKO BAY angled to the inside in early stages tracking off the first flight to the far turn, tipped out to advance between foes racing into upper stretch, took
over nearing midstretch and went clear under firm handling. CALIBRATE, reserved behind the second flight in early stages while tipping a bit off the rail,
steadily gained position inside foes on the far turn, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and prevailed for the place honors. DEVIL VISION settled
between foes under patient handling to the backstretch, was prompted to advance splitting foes just off the inside nearing upper stretch and continued
willingly between foes to gain position to the end while being just outkicked for second. A ROSE FOR RAVEN, forwardly placed along the inside racing to
the first turn, tipped out racing into the backstretch to prompt the pacesetter between foes, pressed the issue entering the far turn but lacked the needed
final response entering the lane. TREASURE RUN sprinted to the lead outside foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside once gaining a clear
advantage on the first turn, set the pace to the second bend, went briefly clear nearing upper stretch but gave out once headed by the winner.
ZUMURUDEE, reserved in the last flight while angling to the rail racing to the first turn, saved ground to upper stretch briefly gaining some position but had
no late response. DR JACK tracked off the first flight between rivals racing to the far turn, angled out six wide entering upper stretch but came up empty in
the drive. KID'S INHERITANCE, urged to a forward placing three wide prompting the pacesetter to the far turn, gave way into upper stretch. TWO BY TWO
was rated off the second flight outside foes racing to the far turn, shifted out five wide while caught in some close quarters nearing upper stretch, then was
fanned seven wide while proving no threat. IRISH DECLARATION, bumped at the start, was held up between foes in the last flight racing to the first turn
and never gained contention. PINTXOS, caught wide racing to the first turn while being prompted to contention, was caught four wide racing into the far turn
and soon emptied out. SEEKING REFUGE broke outwards bumping IRISH DECLARATION at the start, settled between foes and never gained contention.

Footnotes
SEA TO SUCCESS tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening quarter, made a sharp advance on the leader three wide racing through the turn to
wrest command in upper stretch, then edged forward under firm encouragement to prove best. STORMIN HONGKONG settled between foes in the opening
stages, angled out to the five path in upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the place honors late. GIVE EM HECK BECK tracked off
the second flight while angling to the inside racing through the backstretch, switched out to the four path in upper stretch and continued with interest to close
the gap while being outkicked for second. LONELY PRIVATE, urged forcing the pace outside a rival in the opening stages, moved away to a clear
advantage entering the turn, dueled inside the eventual winner racing into upper stretch but gave out leaving the furlong marker. NAME REJECTED settled
last early, saved ground on the turn but never gained contention. BAYOU COLONEL made brief pursuit of the leaders along the inside in the opening
stages, tipped out racing past the half mile marker and emptied out early. DOCTOR K, urged between foes from the break disputing the pace, angled to the
inside dueling for command racing into the turn and gave way early.

Footnotes
THE GREEN CRUSADER tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the second flight in the opening half, advanced three deep entering the far turn to bid
for command, gained a narrow advantage while drifting out in upper stretch, lost the advantage late but continued gamely while drifting well wide to wrest a
narrow advantage in time under brisk handling. NEXT JOURNEY, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter in the opening half, pressed the issue
between foes racing through the far turn, switched outside the eventual winner entering the lane, then altered course inside that foe to strike the front
between calls late but just failed to contain the winner. LOCHMOOR was settled off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out on the
far turn to split foes racing into the stretch and was just outkicked by the top pair. SAINT CHARLES broke sharply, set the pace on a narrow margin to the
far turn, dueled inside foes to upper stretch and gave way late. CHROME KING settled off the second flight outside a rival racing to the far turn and never
gained striking distance. PURE ROCKET tracked the leaders inside a rival in second flight racing to the far turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.
