Footnotes
DIABOLICAL KING was away in good order to stalk the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths
pole and drew off. COYSTER broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, gave way to the winner through the final furlong but finished well to
hold the place. COWBOY TOBY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. FULL OF DRIVE
settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly in the drive. SIDNEY'S HOPE was off a step slow then allowed to settle,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. YOUR ADORABLE disputed the pace from the inside for three furlongs and weakened. OVER EZ
lacked early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and was not a factor. SAMURAI JACK lagged throughout.

Footnotes
JASMINE WHO stalked the pace of MAGNUS WHO while racing four-wide, responded when set down for the drive and wore that rival down in the closing
yards. MAGNUS WHO sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, was in control through mid-stretch but could not resist the
winner late. TAB ME OUT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with good late energy. WILD
FIREWATER was away in good order to race just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. JUVAL settled off
the leaders from between foes, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to rally. STORM THE FIRE showed brief speed and weakened. JAZZ
BOULEVARD was off slow and lagged far back throughout.
