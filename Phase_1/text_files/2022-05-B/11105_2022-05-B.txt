Footnotes
BRONY BOY showed good early speed to duel with rival in the early stages and held gamely in the drive under steady handling. INQUISITION stalked the
pace, raced three wide and got up for the place position late. STANLEY RYDER dueled for the early lead, raced four wide in the stretch and weakened.
NORSKI stalked the pace, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had not enough. PAPAWASAROLLNSTONE dropped back early and failed to
respond. RENO ROY was injured and had to be vanned off.
