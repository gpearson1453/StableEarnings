BIG SCULLY was rated down in the early stages, was coaxed along near the three eighths pole, dug in deep stretch and prevailed under strong pressure.
GOOD OLD CHARLIE was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, made a good three wide near the quarter pole, raced four wide through the upper
stretch and finished gamely to the wire. AMAVI settled off the early pace, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and closed in on the top pair in the final
stages. NINEJUANJUAN CALL was unhurried early on, raced along the inside near the quarter pole and moved up in the drive. JOEBOY stalked the pace,
raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. PAPIRINGO showed good early foot to set the pace and gave way the final eighth of a
mile. HEARTTHROB HALO dropped back early and failed to respond.

handling. BEAUX TOX settled off the early pace, moved up in the stretch drive while racing near the rail and made a good late bid. SUSAN JONES dueled
for the early lead while racing two wide and weakened a bit in the drive. SPECTACULAR IZZY stalked the pace, raced three wide in the stretch run and had
not enough. SASSY SUE'S BAND dropped to the back of the pack early on, raced five to six wide through the upper stretch and had no late rally. LONE
STAR SECRET dueled for the early lead and gave way along the inside. STAR'S DREAM settled off the early pace, raced four wide through the upper

early on, moved up through the far turn, raced five wide into the upper stretch and improved position. BANJO BILL showed good early speed to set the early
pace and gave way in the drive. MY CALL settled towards the back of the pack early on, raced near the inside through the far turn into the stretch and had
not enough in the stretch run. YA GOTTA WANNA dropped back early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. GUILTY LOVER
dropped back early, raced three wide through the far turn and never threatened. HAWKWOOD stalked the pace from the outside and weakened while

Footnotes
SWEET RACHEL showed good early speed to set the early pace, dug in near the eighth pole and held gamely to prove best under all out pressure. NO
QUARTER pressed the early leader from the from the inside and finished gamely to the wire. WICKED ALEX stalked the pace from the outside, raced five
wide in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. CHAMBLISS settled off the early going, raced near the rail and had not enough in the drive. SILKY'S DANCE
stalked the pace, raced three to two wide and had no final winning bid. HEATHER'S REQUEST was unhurried early, raced five wide through the drive and
had no late rally. DOCTRINAIRE stalked the pace from the outside, raced four wide through the far turn and weakened. CIROC O CLOCK was slow early,
raced five wide through the upper stretch and never was a factor. THE THIMBLE dropped back early and failed to respond. SLOW raced far back and never
threatened.
