SPORTSCARR lead the field leaving the chute, saved ground while showing the way, drew clear leaving the final turn, saw margins diminish in the final
sixteenth and held. RYANWATER stalked from the rail, closed the gap through the stretch drive and but was no real threat late. COZY BEAR sat in range
from the four path through the backstretch and weakened. ADMIRAL VANNGO raced from the back of the pack and failed to threaten late. SINGLE
BARREL stalked four to five wide early and tired.

Footnotes
VISION QUEST set the pace while three wide, responded to challenge from MY LUCKY MARK, dueled into the stretch then inched clear of the fore
mentioned, and just held on under a long drive. BUCKYS PICK sat just off the pace, came under urging while closing gradually and narrowly missed. OUR
DANDY'S BOY unhurried early while five wide through the backstretch, took closer order in the far turn, was set down near the three sixteenth marker then
closed gradually and was out finished, settling for show. MY LUCKY MARK prompted from a rail position, moved up alongside VISION QUEST to challenge
the lead, dueled into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. NO MORE GAMES offered little. DEVILS COMMAND was not a factor.

the final turn, closed with every stride but wasn't quite good enough late. QUEEN RHONDA sat outside in the second flight, rallied four wide at the quarter
pole and was unable to improve position in the stretch. MOON AMOUR brushed leaving the gate and offered a mild late bid. SECRET HAVEN sat off the
pace and lodged a bid. GET BAKK broke out into MOON AMOUR the vied for the lead and dropped back with two furlongs remaining.

MAKE GOOD CHOICES contested the early pace from the three path, took pressure from MR. ARTISTIC through the far turn continued to dueled into the
stretch, inched clear and held sway. VIATURE settled in range, angled out after the quarter pole, closed steadily in the final yards and just missed after a
gamely effort. MR. ARTISTIC pressed the pace from the rail, matched strides with MAKE GOOD CHOICES through the final turn, weakened in the final
stages and crossed the wire at the same time as JULIUS THE GREAT for show honors. JULIUS THE GREAT sat just off the pace under snug hold, shifted
out at the quarter pole, closed gradually and finished in a dead heat with MR. ARTISTIC for show. DOC COPE sat in striking range from the four path,
swung out into the lane and showed interest late. BUCK WEST chased six wide through the backstretch, fanned three wide on the turn and came up empty.
FULL VELOCITY trailed the field throughout.

Footnotes
FIRST PRINCE stalked the pace, contested the pace inside BURNING LOVE, and drew clear in the final sixteenth. DURITZ unhurried early, asked to
quicken nearing the quarter pole, bid steadily inside through the stretch, and was along in time for place. BURNING LOVE set the pace while four to five
wide, responded to challenge from FIRST PRINCE, but lacked the rally needed and was run down late. LITTLE CHICAGO fanned five wide leaving the
backstretch and lacked a closing response. TINY TYCOON sat in range, hustled leaving the final turn and failed to improve position in the drive. DANZA
UNBRIDLED stalked from rail and lacked a response when called upon. OUR MONEY CAT fanned three wide entering the far turn and tired early.
IMPERIALITE no contention. MARANGO chased four wide in the turn and came up empty in the drive.
