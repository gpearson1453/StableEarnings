Footnotes
ELEANOR POWELL pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the far turn, dug in late and prevailed under all out pressure.
SIMPLE SOUVENIR was off a step slow, settled off the early going, moved up through the far turn, raced near the inside at the quarter pole, angled out in
the drive and finished gamely to just miss. BLU SKY SUNRISE stalked the pace along the inside down the backstretch, shifted out to race five wide nearing
the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. PACENZA stalked the pace, raced widest through the stretch run and had not enough late.
SHUDDACUDDAWUDDA was allowed to settle early on, raced along the inside through the far turn and had no late rally. CALL ME KITTY showed good
early speed to set the early pace and gave way while racing near the inside. MUSKOKA LADY was off very slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STAYHONOR GOODSIDE showed good early speed to set the pace and drew off in the stretch run to be well clear under steady handlling. CAPTIVE
SILENCE was coaxed along early, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. WICKEDBLACKBULLET was
coaxed early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final winning bid. KAUKOKAIPUU dropped back early, raced along the inside
through the far turn, continued to race near the rail in the stretch run, was checked nearing the sixteenth pole and moved up late. CONFUSING was hustled
along early and weakened through the drive while racing three wide. TREJO stalked the pace, raced along the inside through the far turn, raced two wide in
the lane and never threatened. SUNYANI was off slowly and trailed throughout.

SUMMERTIME MAGIC showed good early speed to set all the pace and held well in the drive to be clear under strong pressure. MRS. BARBARA settled
off the early going, moved up through the far turn, made a good rail bid in the stretch run and closed well late to get up for the place position. JOIN THE
DANCE stalked the top pair early on, raced three to four wide in the drive and kept on to the wire. OUTFOXED pressed the early pace and weakened while
racing two to three wide. GUILEFUL settled off the early pace, lacked room near the three eighths pole, took back and angled out, moved up four wide
through the far turn and had no final bid in the drive. URBAN stalked the pace, raced five wide through the upper stretch and weakened the final eighth of a

Footnotes
ANGELOU tracked the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the far turn and raced well clear in the drive under steady handling.
SECRETARYOFTHENILE stalked the early going, made a good three wide bid but was no match for the winner. GREY SOCIETY stalked the pace, raced
four wide through the upper stretch and had no final winning bid. AWESOME STREET settled to the middle of the pack, raced four wide near the quarter
pole and had no final winning bid. BRIENNE OF TARTH was unhurried early on, raced near the inside at the quarter pole and moved up through the stretch
run to improve position. FRANKEL AT ASCOT (FR) settled early, raced two to three wide and had no response. ASTONISH dropped back early and failed
to respond. INTRO was slow early on, raced along the inside through the upper stretch and never was a factor. ROYAL CHROME failed to sustain a bid.
GOLDSTORM GLORY showed good early speed to set the pace and tired readily in the stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT SCARLET broke to the outside, bumped rival, pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command through upper lane and held well
while racing near the rail to prove best under strong handlling. GAV'S DREAM GIRL was bumped hard at the break, settled off the early going, raced five to
six wide in the drive and got up for the place position late. A trainers objection was filed for the break and stewards ruled no change. ZEN (IRE) stalked the
pace, raced four wide through the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. LITTLE FIRE stalked the pace, made a three wide bid and weakened. RETAIL
THERAPIST settled off the early going, raced three wide and had no rally. JIMMY IS A BREEZE broke in at the start, bumped with rival, settled off the early
going, raced five wide near the quarter pole and had no final bid. TURF AND SURF showed good early speed and gave way while racing along the inside.
VIOGNIER trailed throughout.

CATICHE pressed the early leader down the backstretch, took command through the far turn and was well clear in the drive under steady pressure. LIDO
KEY settled off the early pace, moved up five to six wide through the upper stretch but was no match for the winner. EMMELINE stalked the pace, raced
four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no final bid. ANTIGONE stalked the pace, raced three deep and had not enough in the drive. BLUEGRASS
BELLE was unhurried early on, raced five wide through the upper stretch and had no rally. BAYOU BELLE showed good early speed to set the early pace
along the inside and gave way. AMAZIN QUEEN settled off the early going, raced six wide near the quarter pole and had no late response. LUZ DE LA
LUNA settled to the middle of the pack, raced three to four wide through the upper lane and never was a factor.

Footnotes
SUGAR IS GOLDEN had an awkward start, stalked early leader, bid quarter pole, led eighth pole out and inched away final stages. TALE OF PERFECTION
stalked the leaders three wide, loomed outside late turn but could not match the energy of the winner while a clear second best. PLEASURE'S GOLD led
quickly out of the gate, was pressed around the turn and headed by winner at the eighth pole, held show gamely. GILDED QUEST chased along the inside
duelling speeders, in range to mid-stretch but was outkicked to the wire. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH rated in mid pack early stages, was in range turning for
home while lugging in finishing evenly. DAZZLING DIVA settled off the lead in the backstretch, found her best stride late while closing. HIGH TREASON
trailed the field early, was roused entering the turn but had no response. TIZINGA settled in mid pack early, retreated through the field mid turn.

RAPID RELOAD brushed the gate and was four wide in a scramble for the early lead, led mid turn, drifted out turning for home and held off a stubborn foe
late. COMMANDER JOE took back to stalk early, circled five wide to engage winner at the quarter pole, was out gamed by the winner . RAT PORTAGE was
bumped soundly at the break, racing inside on the turn and angled out upper stretch to loom inside the top pair and levelled out. BET N WIN was between
rivals pressing early pace then dropped back through the turn and offered mild rally final eighth. SUPREMEACTION duelled between runners early stages,
began to lose ground mid turn and retreated from that point on. SEA TO AIR broke inwards at the start and bumped a rival, rushed the rail to engage the
leaders, had a short lead into turn before tiring down the lane.
