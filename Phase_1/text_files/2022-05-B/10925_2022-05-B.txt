Footnotes
GIMMEASOUND dueled up front along the inside, continued to alternated for the advantage through the turn, edged away past the furlong marker while
being kept to task. FULL POWER dueled up front in the two path outside the winner, held a narrow advantage into the turn, remained on equal terms into
the lane then could not match strides, clearly second best. BODE'S LIGHT back off the pace and the inside, carried out to the eight path by a stricken rival
into the turn, angled in a bit but was still five wide into the stretch, rallied midtrack to be up for the show at the wire. BOURBON SKY chased the dueling top
pair off the inside, nipped late for the show spot. EGEAUXTISM last to leave, moved up to head up the second flight through the turn, had little left for the
final furlong. YUKIO back off the pace and the inside, got out while being pulled up in apparent distress early in the turn, vanned off.

TOO MUCH CROWN last to leave, trailed early, moved out and advanced to challenge four wide early in the turn, dueled into the lane remaining off the
inside, clearing late under steady handling holding the runner up comfortably safe. PERMANENTDETENTION away in good order, forwardly placed three
wide, remained in the path following the winner into the stretch, shifted out a bit, finished willingly to be in time for the place, slowly getting to the winner.
THAT ONE GUITAR back off the pace toward the inside, steered out four wide entering the stretch, belated rally, up for the show in the waning strides.
JUSTA BUSTER closest to the early leader, challenged between foes turn, dueled with the winner inside that one into upper stretch, faltered in the final
furlong to lose a couple of positions. T D Z HI COURT broke alertly, soon cleared to the inside, vied through the turn closest to the inside and gave way.

Footnotes
ALIGNED INTEREST broke on top, showed the way into the first turn along the inside, dueled midway backstretch, called on for some run midway on the
far turn, cleared into the lane, steadily increased that advantage to the wire under a right handed crop. NOW YOU RULES four wide into the first turn,
dropped inside to save ground into the far turn, continued to save ground through the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, edging clear
for the second spot. HIGH RIDGE prompted the issue off the inside, headed up the second flight up the backstretch, chased the winner into the stretch,
proved no match for that one, failed to contain the runner up, comfortably well clear of the others. SIR POKERFACE last to leave, void of speed in trailing for
six furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MY BOOK within striking distance outside, four wide into the far turn, came
up empty for the drive. J C'S IN TOWN five wide into the first turn, advanced to challenge then duel outside the winner before a half, began to fade before
six furlongs.

I'LL RAISE YOU narrowly showed the way out of the chute while on the outside, dueled into the turn, disposed of that rival to be clear into the lane, larger
lead a furlong out, held the runner up safe in the waning strides. HONOR MY SPEED off the pace along the inside in the run up the backstretch, steadied in
some traffic into the turn, steered out to be three wide soon after, rallied on the outside to earn the place late, steadily getting to the winner late. TOO MUCH
BOURBON in the second flight for a half off the inside, three wide into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, had little for that one late, could
not contain the runner up in the late going to lose the place. OUTLAW X. vied early just inside the winner, dueled with that one through the early part of the
turn then began to weaken. OFF SIXES void of speed, trailed when four wide into the turn, remained in the four path through the bend, made little impact
through the lane while remaining out in the strip. WAYFARING STRANGER broke on top, vied early between rivals, began a steady retreat before a half.
HALF A BITE flashed brief speed along the inside, gave way.

LIZZ A BEE settled off the pace along the inside, asked for some run far turn, angled three wide into the lane, engaged the leader a furlong outs, wore that
rival down under firm handling. ANGEL OF VERDUN dueled early closest to the inside, allowed the other speed to go onto the backstretch, chased that rival
through the final turn, took over just outside the furlong grounds, responded when confronted by the winner from the outside soon after, gave ground
grudgingly to the wire, clearly second best. CAVE CREEK dueled up front outside the runner up, sprinted well clear before a half, continued to hold a sizable
advantage final turn, weakened when challenged in upper straight. CANDY'S PARADE one paced while well off the rail and in hand, floated out four wide
into the lane by the winner, continued in even fashion to the wire. AMELIA MADELYN fell back to trail before a quarter, continued to lack speed, failed to
muster a closing response. DUEPEG lacked speed, was finished early, trailed home in showing little. FRACTIONAL TIMES UNAVAILABLE DUE TO TIMER

Footnotes
HOT STOVE LEAGUE chased the runner up off the inside, engaged that one from the outside in the three path turning for home, put a head in front past
the furlong marker, lost the advantage a sixteenth out, found more late with a push to prove narrowly best in game fashion. FLASHBURN away well, worked
way clear through the first turn, responded and dueled into the lane, headed from the outside in the two path nearing the furlong marker, regained the
advantage late, outkicked in the late going. TIN DELAY bothered when in tight at the break, lacked speed in trailing early, moved out, rallied four wide out of
the final turn to be well clear of the others, not a threat to the top two. THE BIG IRISHMAN broke out, tightened up TIN DELAY, settled off the pace, lacked
a closing response to be never dangerous. LAST TO KNOW one paced throughout, lacked a closing kick. HE'S A LUCKY MAN settled off the early pace,
finished after a half, fell far back.

through the final turn, vied between foes past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end. FORESTDUNGONE broke alertly, dueled up front closest to
the inside, held a narrow advantage into and through upper straight, also gave ground grudgingly. WISE VERDICT in the second flight along the inside,
continued to stalk final turn, behind some traffic then waited briefly turning for home, went evenly to the wire when clear in lacking a winning response. LIKE

COUNTRY CUT four wide into the first turn when with the first flight, fell back and tracked the two dueling leaders up the backstretch, closer three wide
turning for home, bid between, found more late to gain the nod at the wire in determined fashion. SHOETRICK unhurried for six furlongs while racing just off
the inside, shifted out four wide into the lane, late bid between horses, dueled to the wire, narrowly missed the nod. I'M A FLASHY KID void of speed,
continued to lag second turn, three wide into the lane when roused, made a belated run to earn the show, too late for the top pair. PALIMONIUM moved up
to duel in the two path and between foes early in the far turn, alternated up front with a rival the middle half, began to weaken turning for home. UNBRIDLED
HOPE with the early pace between horses, dueled the middle half closest to the inside, also began to falter when the real running began at the head of the
lane. BIT PART off a step slow, void of speed, trailed early, made a strong move into contention five wide turning for home, shortened stride inside the
furlong grounds, pulled up under the wire in apparent distress, vanned off. KANNON WITH A K flashed some brief early speed along the inside, fell back to
mid pack before a half, was within striking distance when in tight along the rail nearing midstretch, did not recover.
