Footnotes
LIFE'S EMOTIONS sent clear on the backstretch, extended lead on the turn and widened in the stretch under a mild drive. PROJECT LOGIC chased clear
leader off the rail on the backstretch, continued to chase off the rail on the turn, failed to make up ground entering the stretch, proved no match for runaway
winner and kept to task to save second. GODDESS APHRODITE stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, kept to task in
the lane and bested rest. THISONESFORBARRY lacked speed and trailed on the backstretch, stayed along the rail on the backstretch and through the turn,
entered stretch along the rail, angled around horses three wide in upper stretch, responded to urging and just missed third. NISHICO hopped and came
away slow, stalked pace along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, in range for minor placings into the stretch and weakened when asked.
