Footnotes
MYRISKYAFFAIR was taken back between foes early then rated off the pace, moved in while getting closer around the nine-sixteenths, saved ground while
drafting behind the leader early on the turn, shifted three wide in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, ranged up to take the advantage outside the quarter-pole,
shook clear in the four path into the stretch and drew away under a hand-ride to win as the rider pleased. CHARGING LADY tracked the pace down the
backstretch, made a bid in the three path early on the turn then dropped to the two path, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the
winner under urging outside the quarter-pole and proved no match while well clear for the place. OFFICE ETIQUETTE settled on the outside, dropped back
under urging with five furlongs to run, went four then three wide around the turn and came up empty while best of the rest. REIGN OF LOVE was hustled to
the front then set the clear pace off the rail, vied in the two path under urging early on the turn then dropped to the inside, lost the advantage under urging
inside the three-eighths and capitulated. MRS. POSTMAN dropped well behind under urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to threaten.

and was clear for the place. CARLY HUSTLE dropped back while in tight between horses early, was urged along at the rear of the field, traveled around the
turn in the three path and was along for the show. MISS PEPPINA jostled with a foe around the five-eighths, raced just off the pace between horses, was
asked in the three then four path around the turn and came up empty. MEBS WEB settled just off the pace between horses, was asked while shifting from

ALCOOLS brushed with a rival at the start, chased the pace on the outside then in the four path around the turn, pursued the leader under a drive into the
final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and got up to narrowly prevail. CASALSA broke alertly and went straight to the front, set the pace under pressure
to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, battled with REJECTED AGAIN under a drive into the final furlong, disposed of that foe outside the
sixteenth-pole but was denied by the winner while clear for the place. F F ROCKET settled off the pace, chased in the two path around the turn, pursued the
leader under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked while clear for the show. REJECTED AGAIN pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path
around the turn, drew even with the leader near the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final furlong then weakened. ZAEVION brushed with a rival at
the start then was hustled, raced off the pace under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
SOMEBODY was hard ridden at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
BOLD VICTORY settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along while dropping from the six path to the four path around the turn, rallied to take the lead
into upper stretch, kicked clear into the final furlong, was given one final pop of a right-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a
hand-ride to the wire while much the best. NORTH CAROLINA was coaxed along just off the pace, chased four then three wide on the turn, gained to make
a bid into upper stretch, lost touch with the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. KING OF STING was bumped soundly
at the start, settled off the pace, was asked while saving ground around the turn, chased into the final furlong and weakened but was clear for the show.
KOBE'S LEGACY was urged along off the pace, went five then four wide around the turn, dropped back near the three-eighths and came up empty.
BECKENBAUER showed speed then chased the pace, raced in the three path around the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths and tired.
OVEREXAGGERATE broke in and bumped soundly with an opponent, chased the pace down the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, dropped
back with three furlongs to run and faded. MR. J. MCKAY was hustled to the front, vied in the two path around the turn, lost the advantage under urging into
upper stretch and stopped.
