Footnotes
TOUGH TICKETS pressed the pace between foes, took the lead in the two path at the seven-sixteenths, shook clear into upper stretch and drew away
under steady urging. BIG CASTLE broke a bit slow then was forced in severely, moved out to avoid hitting the inner rail, settled off the pace under some
restraint, was asked in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and finished willingly for the place. BREAKING STONES ducked in
badly at the start, recovered to take the early lead, alternating on the pace, vied inside around the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and
weakened but held the show. CENTAVO moved up on the outside with six furlongs to run, alternated on the lead from the outside, vied in the three path
around the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper stretch and tired. YAH HUH broke in at the start, angled in at the rear of the field, saved ground
under urging around the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. NOVA LOVES A FIGHT settled on the outside, was caught five wide early
on the turn then taken up and guided to the three path, moved to the four path under urging around the five-sixteenths and failed to respond. BOHEMIAN
RUBY was rated off the pace, dropped back four then three wide around the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SECRET RULES showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide
into upper stretch, went clear under a drive and was geared down in the late stages to the finish. DANGEROUS EDGE chased three then two wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one and ran on safe for the place honors.
SPECTATORLESS chased inside briefly before tipping to the two path, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch
and weakened while along for the show honors. TRUEBELIEVE chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into
upper stretch, tired. DEE BO chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. THE BIG GREY
struck the near side stall at the start getting away last, chased three to four wide coming under a drive at the seven-sixteenths, tipped five wide into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LORD BROWNIE bumped with a rival at the start, settled just off the pace on the outside, was asked while four then three wide around the turn, gained to
make a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead under a drive, fought outside of two foes to the wire and prevailed under strong urging. TUESDAY'S
CHILD pressed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, fought on with two opponents in the stretch and just missed while narrowly
able to get the place. ALITE was fractious in the gate then backed out and reloaded after being deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came away in
good order, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage in upper
stretch, kept on well in the final furlong but missed while clear for the show. WICKOSITY was urged along at the rear, came under the crop near the
five-eighths pole, went five wide under strong encouragement around the turn and improved position without threatening. THE SLEEPYCHIPMUNK settled
off the pace, went three wide on the turn, raced between rivals from the three-eighths to the five-sixteenths and failed to rally. IGOTTAHAVEIT bumped with
a foe at the start, settled under some urging, saved ground under stronger encouragement around the turn and lacked the needed response. FRONT
PORCH broke out and hit the gate, settled on the inside, moved out outside the five-eighths, went four wide under urging while between foes around the
turn and came up empty. PLATINUM ROAD bumped with an opponent at the start, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back in the two path around
the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
LAKOTA SPIRIT settled on the outside, went three wide around the turn, was roused coming to the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into the stretch, rallied
outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. CHABERTON was taken in hand early then stalked the pace on the outside of the leader,
vied in the two path around the turn, was given her cue late on that bend, took the lead while set down in upper stretch, led into the final strides but was
denied while just able to get the place. MOZAY bumped lightly with a foe at the start, was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground while
asked on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final sixteenth, made a bid between foes late and just
missed while able to get the show. WITH BELLS ON made light contact with a rival at the start then was hustled, showed the way through sensible fractions,
vied inside on the turn, was asked late on that bend, lost the advantage in upper stretch, fought on determinedly in the final furlong but missed the trifecta.
UNWHIRLED bumped with a foe at the start then was taken up with a couple tugs of the left-rein, spotted the front a few lengths, settled at the rear, moved
from the rail to the two path on the turn, gained into upper stretch, rallied into the final furlong, closed well into the final sixteenth, lacked room behind horses
while showing good energy late and lost her best chance at the superfecta. LIBRETTO (IRE) broke out and bumped solidly with a foe, was reserved towards
the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around the far turn, came five wide into the stretch then was roused for more around the three-sixteenths and
gained ground but missed the minor awards. FULL COUNT FELICIA stumbled badly at the start and bumped with a foe, moved up to race towards the front
on the outside, was asked three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, chased under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. THE FLYING
PHAROAH was brushed in the hindquarters after the start, raced towards the rear under reserve, went three then four wide around the turn, came six wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. GET RESPECT bumped with an opponent at the start and was off a step slow, moved up then settled in the
middle of the field, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to rally. I'M GLAD (IRE) settled off the pace, was roused three wide on the turn then
driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response.

THINKING IT OVER coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside, got forced to steady at the nine-sixteenths when rivals tucked in front into the turn,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths tipped to the two path through the bend, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a
challenge a furlong out, knocked heads with TELLAPERFECTTALE inside that station taking command in the last jumps to the finish to prevail over a pair
on the wire. TELLAPERFECTTALE bumped at the start by SILVER FIST, who broke inwards, raced three wide in aim until tucked inside through the turn
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, rallied up the inside to take narrow command a furlong out, dug in
dueling to the finish getting collared in the final strides then just preserved the place honors from a late surging rival. BANKERS DAUGHTER chased three
then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well through the final furlong surging late loosely
between the top pair but missed at the end. READY A. P. five paths off the inside down the backstretch, chased three wide through the turn under coaxing
from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. LIBERTY FLAME four paths off the inside early on, tipped out
and got out an additional two to three paths to be six to seven wide at the nine-sixteenths, went five wide through the turn coming under light coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position passing tired rivals. MAKIN MY MOVE showed the way in hand five paths off
the inside before tucking to the inside into the turn, remained patiently handled through swift splits and was set down spinning three wide into upper stretch,
dug in under threat and was collared at the eighth pole, weakened through to the finish. CAPTIVATING CARA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the
inside briefly before tipping three to four wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. SILVER FIST
broke in at the start bumping TELLAPERFECTTALE, chased four wide until tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing near the quarter pole
and swung three wide for home let out for the drive, then tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
BARRAGE went four wide around the opening bend, was rated on the outside, stalked in the three path around the far turn, took the lead while asked at the
quarter-pole, dueled with the runner-up while inside that foe to the wire and gamely prevailed under strong urging. LORD FLINTSHIRE was taken in hand
while having his path taken shortly after the start, raced near mid-field under reserve, moved closer while shifting from the two path to the four path on the
far turn, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch, dueled with the winner to the wire and was denied while clear for the place. RALLY SQUIRREL was
taken in hand early, rounded the opening bend in the two path, was rated under a snug hold, drafted inside on the far turn, waited behind horses from the
five-sixteenths to the quarter-pole then was asked while shifting three wide, tipped further out while put to a drive around the three-sixteenths, pursued the
top two to the wire and finished willingly for the show. BREADMAN checked when shut-off after the start, saved ground on the opening bend, was reserved
towards the back, went two then three wide around the far turn, came under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MR BREADWINNER
was taken up some while in tight early, raced on the outside under reserve, moved from the three path to the five path while roused on the far turn, held a
reasonable striking position under a drive in upper stretch but came up empty. SON OF AN EX was last to commence then taken back by the rider, lagged
at the rear, saved ground around the far turn and was no factor. SPETTRO came away fast then swerved out in front of foes after the break, dropped to the
inside and showed the way through solid fractions, was asked coming to the quarter-pole then lost the advantage into the stretch and gave way. STOP THE
SPREAD went three wide on the first turn, moved up late on that bend to prompt the pace on the outside, vied in the two path on the far turn, dropped back
between foes at the five-sixteenths pole and capitulated.

HIGHLY MOTIVATED bumped at the start by THE REDS, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide down the backstretch from mid pack early on
before advancing to be just off the pace when tucking along the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, rallied to collar the leader between foes a furlong from home, then dug in gamely leaning lightly on STAGE RAIDER nearing the finish to
prevail by a neck. STAGE RAIDER five paths off the inside down the backstretch just off the pace, tucked three wide through the turn and was patiently
handled through the bend until set down spinning three wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive to knock heads with the top one inside the final furlong
and was under a light tepid drive being shown the crop to the off side while getting leaned on lightly late and was bested at the end. SIBELIUS coaxed from
the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, got let out taking the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
threat from a pair and was caught a furlong from home, ran on inside well clear of the rest for the show honors in a good effort. THE REDS broke in at the
start bumping HIGHLY MOTIVATED, chased three to four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. KERSHAW coaxed from the start, chased four then three wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. MARKET ALERT broke through the gate prior to the start inspiring TOO
BOSS to do the same, broke out at the start taking over the lane of the slower breaking TOO BOSS and chased three then two wide under coaxing from the
five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. TOO BOSS broke through the gate prior to the start when inspired to do so by MARKET
ALERT, broke a beat slow at the start lunging slightly and chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path into the turn, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. CAPTAIN BOMBASTIC chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled five
wide into upper stretch, faltered and was eased home to the finish.

CHARDY PARTY (IRE) was reserved on the outside, went three then four wide around the turn, rallied outside into upper stretch then closed well to take
the lead, responded well under threat in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. BREEZE EASY (GB) was taken in hand early then
rated off the pace, went two then three wide around the turn, gained into the stretch then paused while in tight between foes at the three-sixteenths, altered
out shortly thereafter, chased into the final furlong, made a bid into the final sixteenth and just missed while narrowly able to get the place. SAIL BY tracked
the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, made a bid at the quarter-pole, fought on
determinedly in the stretch and just missed while able to get the show. WONKA brushed with a foe after the start, settled towards the back, moved from the
inside to the two path around the turn, was roused four wide into the stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well but missed the trifecta.
DERRYNANE brushed with a foe just after the start then bobbled slightly, moved in and established a good position just off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, was asked in the two path into upper stretch, chased under a drive to the wire and was out-kicked. OURAIKA (FR) was reserved in the back half of the
field, went two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch, raced under a drive into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead
outside the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed kick. LOST MY SOCK settled off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide into the
stretch and lacked the needed response. SNOW LOVES A FIGHT settled at the rear of the field, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven four
wide into the stretch and failed to rally. CHAMPAGNE POETRY broke open the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, was hustled to
the lead, showed the way on the inside, lost the advantage into upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
TWO DOWN two to three wide near the rear of the field, came under coaxing tipped three to four wide at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, was in behind SHARP SENSATION nearing the eighth pole and leaned out on MARTINEZ attempting to open a lane before SHARP SENSATION
drifted in, burst on through the lane inside the eighth pole and offered up a good finish surging home late to get up and prevail inside the final forty yards.
BRENNAN'S WAR coaxed from the start, showed the way in hand along the inside, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone late threat and was caught in the late stages while safe for the place honors. SHARP SENSATION
chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. MARTINEZ coaxed from
the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, got leaned on by TWO DOWN nearing the eighth
pole, then offered up a mild kick. EMINENCY coaxed from the gate, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch, kept on to the finish but was outkicked. CROCK OF GOLD prompted the pace from the two path under coaxing from the three-eighths,
spun three wide for home, weakened. ERIDROMOS coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside
route into upper stretch and offered no response. UNLIKELY coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SELL SOMETHING four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two
path through the turn coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TONALISTIC three wide in
pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide for home and tired.
