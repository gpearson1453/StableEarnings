GREAT BARONESS was off slowly, reserved early, eased out and was four wide by the quarter pole while advancing, made a five wide bid leaving the turn
and drew off smartly to prove best, driving. NYX AND CHAOS pressed the early pace and then dueled three wide for the lead by the quarter pole but proved
to be no match for the winner while clearly second best. MY LADY'S AUNT MA was well placed on the inside, angled out in the drive and was up for the
show award. FUELED UP set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened in the drive, lost show award late. VICTORY REIGNS pressed the early pace
in between horses, fell off the pace on the turn, angled out in the stretch and was empty.

FROSTED ANGEL was rated early while three wide, then was three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and closed well on the outsider to
wear down rivals late to get up under a drive. AMEN SYLVIA was settled early and advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn
for racing room, finished well but was outfinished late. SINISE was settled early five wide, angled in on the turn and closed well up the inside but too late.
PURELY SILVER set the early pace and was headed by the furlong marker and faded late. MAJESTIC GREELEY tracked the early pace and made a three
wide bid on the turn to go on even terms for command by the furlong marker and flattened out. UNION RALLY chased the early pace, came widest into the

SOUR MASH vied for the lead on the inside and made a bid to draw clear nearing the quarter pole, then remained clear to prove best under a drive. TIZ A
SHARPIE was allowed to settle early, eased out and advanced five wide by the quarter pole, finished willingly to be second best. GIMME'S GOLDENGIRL
was rated three wide early, then advanced four wide by the quarter pole but lacked the needed stretch bid, bested rest. PARANOIA vied for the lead three
wide and weakened in the drive. KATY THE CAT was reserved early and then was three wide by the quarter pole and was not a threat. MIRACLES
SUNSHINE was rated along the inside and dropped back.

COOL COMEDIAN stalked the pace three wide and made a three to four wide bid leaving the turn and then exchanged bumps by the furlong marker and
prevailed late to prove best in a gutsy effort. RADIEUX was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole,
exchanged bumps with the winner by the furlong marker and just missed after a long drive. SACRED MOUNTAIN was well placed early on the inside,
shifted three wide leaving the turn, needed a stretch bid while getting up for the show award. LONG TOM was void of early speed, advanced two wide on
the turn and angled out in the drive and had a belated rally. ALL TACKED UP set the pace on the inside and was headed nearing the furlong marker and
faded the final furlong. BOCK was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and came six wide into the lane and had no rally. UNCLE YUDI
was settled on the inside and tired.

late to prove best under a drive. RUN FAST was off slowly, advanced four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and closed the gap fast late.
EXPENSIVE pressed the pace and was between rivals two wide on the turn and faded in the stretch. DREAMING OF LOVE pressed the early pace on the
inside and saved ground throughout and weakened in the drive. LEAVE 'EM LOADED was off slowly, raced wide on the turn and came six wide into the
lane and offered a belated rally. GEM JUAN was off very slowly, then had no rally on the inside. AFLEET TRAXX was fgractious in the gate, hesitated at the
start, failed to menace. ROYAL KAZ pressed the early pace three wide and was in between horses on the turn and folded.
