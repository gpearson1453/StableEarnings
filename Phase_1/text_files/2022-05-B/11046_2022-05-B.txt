Footnotes
BREXTON, reserved outside a rival in early stages, gradually gathered momentum nearing upper stretch, switched out five wide entering the lane and
produced a steady late response to prevail under firm handling. JUST RIGHT MIKE, forwardly placed along the inside, was eased off the pace racing into
the turn, was urged to advance along the rail challenging for command in upper stretch to gain the advantage between calls, resisted the winner's bid but
came up second best. COURAGEOUS TIMMY settled off the first flight along the inside on the backstretch, tipped out entering the lane and found his best
stride between foes in the closing stages. FIRE EXTINGUISHER, urged between foes pressing the pace from the outset into the turn, gave way midstretch.
NORTHERN WOODS vied for command three wide between foes racing to the turn and gave way into upper stretch. CANDY PRINCE joined the pace four
wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace three wide into the turn but came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
SILVER DASH forwardly placed along the inside, was held up momentarily racing into the bend, tipped out three wide midway through the turn continuing
with a steady bid, wrested the advantage and went clear under left handed pressure. MAGIC REVOLUTION, settled along the inside, saved ground on the
turn gaining position, shifted four wide in upper stretch and edged a rival for second. DEVOTED TO YOU, urged inside a rival prompting the pace, switched
outside that foe pressing the issue nearing the turn, took over nearing the lane but couldn't match the top pair late. RUBY'S RED DEVIL, caught in close
quarters, then off a bit slowly, settled between foes racing to the turn and continued evenly. PASSTHECAT was prompted to make some brief progress four
wide racing just off the second flight to the turn but steadily faded nearing the lane. SING N SPURS bobbled at the start, was urged between foes disputing
the pace, angled to the inside dictating terms on a narrow advantage into the bend and gave way after a half. J J'S WILDCAT was urged to track off the first
flight three wide between foes in early stages and gave way into the turn.

Footnotes
HAP HOT broke sharply, was hustled clear of the field in the opening quarter, held sway on a comfortable margin to upper stretch and widened late under
brisk handling. BACK TO SELLING, unhurried three deep in second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to make a steady advance in that
path into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but proved best of the others. TIGER HUNTER, a bit outpaced early, was prompted to advance
outside foes entering the bend, drifted out to the four path nearing upper stretch and continued well enough to gain a share. TEN THOUSAND TIDES
tracked the pacesetter inside foes racing to the turn but offered no rally. K C'S FIRST B M W was urged pursuing the pacesetter between rivals into the turn
but gave way after a half. HUNTER JUMPER proved no factor. LANAKILA was a brief factor between foes but emptied out early.

Footnotes
HIGHTAIL COWBOY, forwardly placed along the inside tracking just off the pacesetter, switched outside that foe nearing upper stretch, took over entering
the lane and kicked away under pressure. MOUNTAIN PINE, off a step slowly, tracked off the second flight along the inside racing to the turn, tipped out
nearing upper stretch, then altered course to the inside in the lane, split foes late and edged rivals for the place honors. DIABLO CUERNO tracked the
leaders four wide in second flight on the backstretch, was fanned four wide in the lane and continued willingly to prevail for a share. BON DEUX settled off
the second flight in early stages, angled inwards nearing the turn to gain position between foes racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late kick.
CYBER MONDAY settled outside foes racing to the turn, raced five wide into upper stretch and made no impact. HEAVENLY GAZEBO sprinted to the lead
while angling inside, set the pace on a clear margin to upper stretch and gave out abruptly once headed by the winner. YOUWONDERWHYIDRINK proved
no factor. COINCIDENTAL stumbled just after the start, made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but emptied out nearing the lane.

BEACH FLOWER tracked the pacesetter outside a rival from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch, angled to the inside after a half, gradually
drew into striking distance in tandem with a rival nearing upper stretch, tipped out entering the lane to bid for command between foes and produced a steady
late response to wrest the advantage under firm handling. RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC broke sharply, sprinted well clear of the field into the backstretch, held
sway on a clear margin to upper stretch, resisted the winner's bid to late stages but proved only second best. NICENO was settled last to the backstretch,
gathered momentum on the far turn, swung four wide racing into upper stretch and continued willingly. PRANCE tracked off the second flight racing to the
backstretch, shifted out three wide gaining contention nearing upper stretch but flattened out late. HUNTER'S MAGIC tracked the pacesetter inside the
eventual winner from out of striking distance racing to the backstretch and gave way after a half.

empty in the drive. MY INDY dropped out early. BODENHEIMER broke slowly, was prompted to gain a contending position while being forced out four wide

PLANE TALK broke sharply, sprinted clear of the field while angling over racing to the turn, steadily widened his advantage and was kept to firm
encouragement. SIR WELLINGTON, off a bit slowly, was taken up avoiding tight quarters after the opening furlong, switched outside foes nearing the bend
to advance three wide entering the turn, was fanned four, then five wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to prevail for second. BAYTOWN
BEAR hopped at the start, switched outside foes while being hustled to gain a contending position three wide racing into the bend, was carried out a bit by
CHESS MASTER in upper stretch and flattened out late. MINISTER OF SOUL tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing into the turn, lost
some ground nearing upper stretch, shifted out four wide racing through the stretch and produced a second effort to regain some position. CHESS
MASTER, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, drifted out entering upper stretch and came up empty late. SHIP IT RED settled
along the inside early and failed to menace. JAZZY TIMES broke readily, was rated between foes in the second flight but faded early.

Footnotes
TAILORBESWIFT, urged inside a rival disputing the pace from the outset into the turn, drifted out in upper stretch but edged clear under pressure. C C THE
BARTENDER broke awkwardly, angled to the inside while prompted to gain a position just off the second flight racing to the turn, shifted out three wide to
advance between foes in upper stretch and prevailed for the place honors late. SWEET HONOR tracked the leaders outside a rival in second flight racing to
the turn, was urged to advance three deep nearing the lane, was carried out four wide in upper stretch and was outkicked for second. GRAND SLAM
HOMERUN, urged forcing the pace outside a rival from the outset racing to the turn, gave way midstretch. JAGGED ARROW, caught in tight quarters at the
start, settled outside foes early, angled in nearing the lane to advance between foes and continued evenly. SAILSINTHESUNSET shuffled a bit at the start,
angled to the rail racing as part of the last flight into the turn but had no closing bid. DISTINCT APPROVAL made brief pursuit of the leaders three wide
between foes and emptied out early. PURPLE SCOOTER tracked off the second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane. JUST
SPLENDID dropped out early.

Footnotes
TONKA WARRIOR, forwardly placed along the inside in the opening stages, eased off the leaders in the second furlong, tipped out three wide racing into
the turn continuing with a steady bid, moved to challenge for command in that path midstretch and prevailed under firm right handed encouragement.
GLASSATO, held up last in the opening stages, switched out four wide racing into the bend to loom outside the leaders in upper stretch and continued
willingly to prevail for the place honors. INCREDIBLE BILL, urged between foes, then along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage racing into
the bend, weakened leaving the sixteenth marker. NOTACRY urged pressing the pace three wide, then between foes into upper stretch, faded late.
RUNAWAY HARRY angled to the inside tracking the leaders, saved ground to the lane but had no rally. P R CALL ME MAYBE dropped out early.
