PELOTA quickly took command, was never seriously threatened and widened throughout under a brisk hand ride. O'BRIEN pursued the winner outside,
was no match for the winner but finished willingly for the place. FICTIONALFAIRYTALE saved ground close up and continued willingly while no threat.
STASH MY CASH lacked speed and rallied mildly through the stretch. ROWDY RED GLARE broke slowest, rushed to contention then gave way. OLD
BEAU dropped back early and trailed throughout.

LITTLE J P soundly bumped at the start, sped to the front and held rival safe in a driving finish. HESFIREDUP came out quickly and pressed the winner
throughout in a game showing. KEITHSENDSHELLOOOO was bothered from his inside at the start and closed well. I ONCE STOOD ALONE ducked out at
the break causing crowding then weakened late. CALIFORNIA GHOST was severely bothered at the break and always far behind. The stewards conducted
an inquiry into the start and the fourth finisher was placed last. Objections by the rider of CALIFORNIA GHOST against the second and third finishers were
dismissed, DONTINVADEMYSPACE was injured in the starting gate and ordered a late scratch.

YODEL E. A. WHO far behind early, moved very wide on the turn and into the lane then offered a late surge to get up in time. SMOOTH B dueled
throughout, shook off inside rival, gamely held off outside challenge but was caught late. WORD ON A WING stalked the dueling leaders three wide, bid into
the stretch, loomed a threat and continued willingly. BROAD STREET BULLY lacked speed outside then flattened out in the stretch. PRESS MY BETS was
urged just off the pace inside and began fading on the turn. ABSENTEE stumbled at the start and lagged far behind then offered some late energy.
ADMIRAL ABE set a measured pace under rating for half a mile and stopped.

Footnotes
SIX O'CLOCK SARAH controlled the pace inside, repelled a challenge turn then drew away through the final furlong. CRAZY SERENA chased outside,
made a menacing bid into the stretch and flattened out late. POOR NO MORE far back early, moved very wide on the turn with a late gain. PAPER
MANSION pressed the winner to midway on the turn and weakened. WRITE THE CHECK dropped back at the start, moved wide on the turn and faded.
PLATINUM ICE forced the pace along the rail in the opening quarter then stopped.
