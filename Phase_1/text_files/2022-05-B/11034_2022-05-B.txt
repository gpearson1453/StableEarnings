Footnotes
FIGHTINGTEMPTATION stalked three wide in the early stages, vied three wide on the backside, dueled with KACHINA on the far turn, gained a short lead,
dug in gamely in the stretch drive and held sway late. SMOKIN' OKIE raced off the pace inside, moved up two wide on the far turn, came three wide into the
lane, rallied outside, finished well and was gaining at the end. KACHINA vied inside for command, dueled with the winner on the turn, dug in gamely on the
rail in the stretch run and then yielded. CIRCLE BACK GIRL tracked close up on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and lacked a winning bid. PLENTY
OF VISION was fractious behind the gate and reluctant to load, raced four wide early, stalked close up four wide, chased outside on the far turn and tired.
RIVER VENUS raced five wide early, then two wide off the pace and did not factor. LIL' JIMMI SUE vied two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
HE'S MUNNIE raced four wide early, then moved up three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied steadily outside, dueled and drew clear late
under urging. EUROBOND away alertly, set the pace, responded when challenged, drifted out in front of BURTNJOE at the furlong marker, then dug in
gamely and held on for second. CABOT chased on the inside, rallied on the rail in the stretch and was up late for third. BURTNJOE chased four wide early,
moved up on the turn, rallied between horses into the stretch, altered course behind EUROBOND passing the eighth pole, then rallied in the two path.
BOURBON COWBOY raced off the pace, three wide on the turn and had no rally. KNIGHT DISRUPTOR chased three wide early, between rivals on the
turn and tired. CROSSBOW CIMARRON chased between rivals early, inside on the turn and faded. After a Stewards' Inquiry and Trainer Objection by the
fourth place finisher against the second place finisher, EUROBOND was disqualified and placed fourth for interference in the stretch run. The quarter mile
time was unavailable.
