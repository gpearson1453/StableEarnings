Footnotes
MASABEEH just off the inside in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied under a drive
issuing a challenge a furlong out, coming in very slightly when taking command at that station, then dug in knocking heads to the finish and gamely
prevailed over a pair on the wire. QUARIA THUNDER brushed the off side stall at the start, prompted the leader from the outside in the two path coming
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and took over command straightened away in the two path, dug in under threat coming out
under a left handed stick a furlong from home forcing MARTINI'S AMICA to check between foes when MASABEEH took over command, fought on head to
head to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. CANDLESTICK MAKER just off the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, rallied surging late to miss at the finish. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL two to three wide in pursuit, got set
down angled four wide into upper stretch and improved position for the last major share. MARTINI'S AMICA tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, rallied into a seam between the top pair near the eighth pole and had the seam close down
when QUARIA THUNDER came out under a left handed crop and was forced to check out conceding two lengths of ground before being engaged once
more by the rider and offered little weakening to the end. DON'T BE CHEEKY three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six
wide into upper stretch and tired. BELLESHAZZA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths,
spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and tired. GAILHORSEWIND tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing
from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch, made no impact. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the stretch run as well as a Claim of foul by
the rider of MARTINI'S AMICA alleging interference against QUARIA THUNDER and MASABEEH. After review the claim of foul was dismissed and the
result was allowed to stand prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
CARAMEL SWIRL was taken in hand early then rated just off the pace, drafted inside to the two path under restraint around the turn, was asked coming to
the quarter-pole, made contact with PIECE OF MY HEART while nudging her way out into upper stretch, accelerated to the front outside the eigth-pole,
shook clear into the final furlong and drew away impressively while under a hand-ride in the final sixteenth. DEALING JUSTICE moved in while hustled to
the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside around the turn, was asked for her best into upper stretch, lost the advantage under the crop
outside the furlong marker and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. PIECE OF MY HEART was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace
on the outside, vied two then three wide around the turn, was nudged out by the winner while dropping back inside the quarter-pole and weakened but was
far clear for the show. JUST READ IT was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked while three then four wide around the turn,
chased into the stretch and came up empty. LETMETAKETHISCALL had her blinkers switched to the house blinkers behind the gate, settled at the rear
under some restraint, was roused while two to three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MY DELICIOUS got brushed at the start by KEEN DANCER, who broke out a step, chased three then two wide, got set down angled four wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the stretch taking command a sixteenth from home, and dug in gamely to repel her rival to the finish to prevail.
MISCREANT five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and advanced on the front to take command nearing the
quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, got roused under growing threat with three-sixteenths to go, dug in under challenge and was headed a
sixteenth out, battled on inside to the wire clear of the rest for the place honors. KEEN DANCER broke out at the start brushing MY DELICIOUS, chased
three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and offered up a mild bid. MS NO VAX got bumped at the start by
ACE GIRL and in turn bumped THATSJUSTLOVELY, dueled four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the quarter pole and went two to three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.
THATSJUSTLOVELY bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe due to pressure from ACE GIRL, dueled inside of MS NO VAX from the three path
down the backstretch and then along the rail through the turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and faltered. ACE GIRL bobbled at the break
recovering inwards and bumping MS NO VAX into THATSJUSTLOVELY, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through
the turn, went four to five wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
SIDD FINCH settled near the middle of the field, moved from three to four wide early on the turn, shifted five wide while given his cue outside the
five-sixteenths, dropped to the four path while rallying into the stretch, took over near the three-sixteenths then kicked clear under a right-handed crop and
proved much the best under steady urging. AMEDEUS MUSIC settled on the far outside, tucked in some leaving the backstretch, started the turn in the
three path then shifted five wide, turned into upper stretch under a drive, chased the winner into the final furlong and proved no match but finished with good
courage to just get the place. PRAYER BOOK bumped with a foe shortly after the start, was taken under a hard hold while tugging at the bit early, moved
out while reserved off the pace, was roused four wide on the turn, passed foes under a drive in upper stretch, brushed with a rival outside the sixteenth-pole
and finished willingly to just miss the place while clear for the show. ACHILLES HEEL bumped with foes at the start, was rated on the inside, came under
urging around the five-sixteenths, moved out in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. SUPER WICKED CHARM bumped with an opponent at the start,
moved out early on the backstretch, settled towards the back, was urged along in the two path around the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch and failed
to threaten. OCEAN DEEP tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path around the turn and tired. NOBLE CONQUEST was rated
under tight restraint on the outside, went four wide around the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, bumped
with a foe while between horses inside the furlong marker then checked and lost any chance at the superfecta. GHOSTMON was rated off the pace, went
three wide around the turn, was asked late on that bend, raced between foes into the final furlong, bumped with a foe inside the furlong marker and was in
tight then lacked the needed response. EXALTED CHARM went to the front from the outside post, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside
around the turn, was asked under pressure late on that bend, lost the advantage to the winner around the three-sixteenths and gave way. BOHEMIAN
RUBY settled near the back, went two then three wide under urging on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. MALIBU STAR
dropped towards the rear of the field, saved ground around the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
BALTHUS (IRE) tracked four then three wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong from home, drew clear under a drive to the finish kept to task. GOOD MEDICINE forwardly placed just off the inside early on, took
over command seven furlongs from home and began to slip away accompanied by the riderless animal to the outside, got coaxed along in the far turn
almost dueling with that rival sans rider and was set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out,
kept on to just preserve the place honors on the wire. SNOW'S ISLAND broke out at the start and bumped NEVER CHANGE then bounced off that foe to
bump GRAND CAY, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept on to just miss for the
place honors on the line. GRAND CAY got bumped at the start by SNOW'S ISLAND, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. STJAMES tracked the pace along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun three
wide for home and weakened. GREG'S HONOR just off the pace tracking just off the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued just off
the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DREAM OF A DAY chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch
and weakened. NORDIC LIGHT saved ground near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung three wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. NEVER CHANGE bumped at the start by SNOW'S ISLAND, raced four wide through the first turn and then five paths off the inside
down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the far turn, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. BALI RIDDIM chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired. UNION BUSTER led early on before being headed by GOOD MEDICINE
seven furlongs from home, settled three wide in closest aim of that leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch and
faltered. REMOTE stumbled badly at the start pecking the ground and tossing the rider over his head, ran riderless among the field and was apprehended
by the outrider after the finish and walked off under his own power. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on REMOTE before the result was
allowed to stand and the race was declared official.

MY LAST MISSION went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path through the turn, responded well
when set down in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker and held under strong urging. SILIPO broke a half-step slow, was rated off
the pace, started the turn in the two path then shifted four wide, was asked around the seven-sixteenths, passed the five-sixteenths under the crop, gained
in the final furlong and finished with good energy for the place. DOIN'ITTHERIGHTWAY broke a step slow then was hustled, raced at the rear under urging,
rounded the turn in the two path, gained under a drive in the final furlong and improved position to just get the show. CATCH THE SMOKE settled just off
the pace, saved ground around the turn, was asked inside the three-eighths, shifted three wide coming to the quarter-pole, pursed the winner under the crop
in the stretch and lacked the needed kick then just missed the show. HEADS OR TAILS tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the
turn, chased four wide into the stretch and tired. SAILOR SPEED settled on the outside, dropped back under urging while four to five wide around the turn,
moved in coming to the quarter-pole and had nothing left.

Footnotes
BANK ON ANNA bumped at the start by TOWERING ORBIT due to pressure from WAILIN JOSIE, prompted the leader from the outside three then two
wide through the turn between foes from the three-eighths, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch taking over
command inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in to gamely repel a challenge to the finish. KHALI MAGIC four then three wide in aim of the
front, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths latching on the top pair from the outside, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latching
on the leader through the final furlong but was ultimately repelled to the wire. WAILIN JOSIE veered out at the start bumping TOWERING ORBIT solidly into
BANK ON ANNA, chased along the inside patiently handled and tipped two to three wide into upper stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to go and kept
on to chase the top pair home while along for the show honors. TOWERING ORBIT got bumped solidly at the start by the aforementioned foe who veered
outwards and in turn bumped BANK ON ANNA, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn and
facing some pressure from BANK ON ANNA to the outside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and yielded
command straightened away, then tired through to the finish.

GRADED ON A CURVE bumped solidly with a foe at the start, went three wide around the opening bend, was reserved off the pace, came under
encouragement between foes in the two then three path on the far turn, rallied to make a bid outside the quarter-pole, took a short lead in upper stretch,
fought outside of two foes into the final furlong, disposed of those rivals into the final sixteenth and edged clear under steady handling. RUSE raced in the
three path on the opening bend, prompted the pace on the outside, was put to coaxing in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch on even
terms for the lead, battled with two foes into the final furlong, lost touch with the winner into the final sixteenth and was out-kicked but just earned the place.
BAR FOURTEEN broke out at the start then went to the front, set the pace on the inside while in hand, was asked outside the quarter-pole, lost the
advantage to the winner before the three-sixteenths, battled inside of two opponents into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and was
outfinished then just missed the place but earned the show. DANZIGWITHTHESTARS broke out at the start, settled on the inside, drafted behind the leader
around the far turn, was roused in upper stretch then came under the crop outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. JADE'S DREAM
broke a step slow then was taken up, went two to three wide on the turns, angled out under a drive in upper stretch, held a reasonable striking position into
the final furlong but lacked the needed response. GOOD OLD BOY bumped solidly with a rival at the start, went four wide on the first turn, was rated on the
outside, came under urging between foes in the three then four path around the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. EL HERMANO
broke out at the start, dropped back under urging while saving ground around the first turn, settled at the back, rounded the far turn in the two path, came
out into the stretch and was no factor. PLEASE NOTE THAT GRADED ON A CURVE RACED FOR WAIVER CLAIMING
