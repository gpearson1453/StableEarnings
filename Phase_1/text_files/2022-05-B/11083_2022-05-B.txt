Footnotes
KISS RIDE GOODBYE settled off of the early pace, was roused while three then four wide approaching the top of the lane, advanced in upper stretch,
overtook the pacesetter leaving the eighth pole and kicked clear late. DON'T TELL HYDEE stalked the fractions through the turn, mounted a three wide bid
into the drive, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and was outkicked in the final stages while besting the rest. ZU ZU FLYNN was sent leaving the
break and set the moderate pace through the turn, took a narrow lead into the final furlong but could not hold off the top pair in the end and gave way, while
clear of the rest for third. GOLD RUSH GAL chased the pace from the midflight while saving ground and did not have a late response. JANERO ROSE
bobbled at the start and recovered nicely to be forwardly placed early on, pressed the pace through the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and faded late.
MAGGIE FITZGERALD chased the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MIRACLE IN MOTION kept close attendance to the early pace, advanced on the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole, overtook TROPICANA GIRL in upper
stretch, opened to a clear lead into the final furlong, drifted a bit in the late stages but was clear in the end. LIGHT UP tracked the early pace from the
midflight, mounted a three wide rally into the drive, was outfinished in the late going by the winner but was best of the rest. TROPICANA GIRL broke a step
slowly, was sent in hand to the front and set moderate fractions while being pressed through the turn, was overtaken by the winner in upper stretch and
gave way in the late going, while clear of the rest for third. CHULA GIRL broke out leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, chased the pace through the
turn and did not offer a late rally. TIZ A TIGER chased the pace to the turn, dropped back midway through the turn, lost contact in upper stretch, was eased
in the final stages and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
TIZ AN EDVENTURE settled off of the early pace, saved ground into the second turn, advanced in upper stretch, tipped out inside of the furlong marker,
made a steady advance through the final sixteenth to reel in MYBLUEBELL and had a late surge to prevail. MYBLUEBELL (FR) was hustled leaving the
break, set the pace while being prompted into the second turn, extended the lead in upper stretch and into the final furlong, was reeled in in the final
sixteenth and could not hold off the winner's late bid in the end but was best of the rest. ROSE PRINCESS settled just off of the early pace while saving all
of the ground, advanced nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid into upper stretch but was outkicked in the final stages, while clear for third. CROWN
KITTEN settled off of the early pace, was three wide into the backstretch run, maintained that path into the second turn, swung widest into the stretch and
passed tired foes in the late stages. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) bumped CLASS CODE leaving the start, stalked the pace from the midflight while three wide on
the first turn, came three then four wide along the second turn and did not offer a late response. MISS SUPER SAINT contested the early pace then took
back to prompt the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker and weakened in the drive. CLASS CODE
was bumped at the start, stalked the moderate early pace, lost position on the second turn and faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
FUMANO'S GIRL was a bit slow into stride, improved on the turn while four wide, continued to rally in upper stretch, came within aim inside of the furlong
marker, overhauled the runner-up nearing the sixteenth marker and kicked clear in the end in a good debut. YVONNE'S MISS tracked the pace to the turn,
advanced nearing the quarter pole, confronted the pacesetter in upper stretch, dueled with that foe to inside of the eighth pole, edged clear nearing the
sixteenth marker but was overhauled by the winner and outfinished in the end while just holding for second. DANZIGS STAR STORM chased the early pace
from midflight while saving ground, improved position in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final stages but just missed for second while holding for third.
GRAZED MY HEART lacked early speed while just off of the rail, gained ground along the turn, continued that gain through the drive and just missed for the
minor awards in the end. SMILING LADY was hard sent leaving the break and set the pace to the turn, came under pressure in upper stretch, stayed on
inside of the furlong marker but weakened in the final stages. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY lacked early speed, saved ground while trailing through the turn,
tipped out at the top of the lane and showed late interest in the drive but was not able to make an impact. GENTLE JULIA chased the early pace, came
three wide along the turn, lost position in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. RAVENCOIN chased the early pace outside of rivals, angled in
along the turn to be two wide nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
ALVAARO engaged with BRONZE WARRIOR in the early going and contested the solid pace with that foe to the second turn, was put to firm left-handed
urging at the top of the stretch, shook free leaving the eighth pole and widened the lead in the end. BRONZE WARRIOR engaged with ALVAARO leaving
the chute and contested the pace with that foe through the second turn while carving out solid fractions, was on even terms with the winner at the top of the
stretch but could not match strides in the drive and was outfinished, while besting the rest. SACRED RIDER was unhurried in the early going, was two to
three wide on the first turn then came four wide along the backstretch run, gained ground on the second turn while three deep, was outkicked by the top pair
in the drive but was an easy third in the end. ON RAGLAN ROAD stalked the early pace from a three wide path, took back along the backstretch run,
maintained position into the second turn, could not match strides in upper stretch, tired in the final stages and was reported to have bled when pulled up
following the race. COPPER HALO settled off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, was outrun on the second turn, was eased through
the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
TROJAN CLUBHOUSE was sent to the front leaving the break, set moderate fractions to the second turn while on a clear lead, was set down for the drive,
was confronted in the final stages by IMPERIAL CREED, dug in in the final strides and determinedly held on to prevail. IMPERIAL CREED stalked the early
pace three deep on the first turn, stayed within range into the second turn, closed on the winner inside of the furlong grounds while under firm handling and
was denied by the determined winner, while besting the rest. MISTY CAT bobbled at the start and then was in tight leaving the break, settled just off of the
pace while in the two path on the first turn, maintained position into the second turn, gained ground in upper stretch, was outkicked by the top pair but closed
willingly to be clear for third. GETTIN SIDEWAYS was shuffled back while in tight at the start, was unhurried while saving ground early on, advanced on the
second turn, rallied in upper stretch along the inside and was outfinished in the late stages. CREATIVE ROMANCE stalked the pace from the midflight,
came three wide on the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and did not mount a late rally. SUGAR KISSES settled off of the early pace while three
wide, lost position along the backstretch run, came three then four wide along the second turn and did not offer a late bid.

CHRISTMAS DIAMOND (GB) stalked the early pace to the first turn, gained along the backstretch run, loomed two wide nearing the quarter pole, overtook
HILLSDALE NATION coming into the stretch run, extended the lead nearing the eighth pole and pulled away in the end as much the best. RIVIERA
SUNRISE broke alertly and cleared the field into the first turn to set the pace, took back to cede the lead into the backstretch run, lost position on the second
turn, re-rallied in upper stretch, was no match in the end for the winner but was best of the rest. COCORITA was unhurried in the early stages, maintained
position through the backstretch run while just off of the rail, advanced along the inside on the second turn and into upper stretch and was outkicked in the
late stages while just holding for third. ACTION FOR AUTISM was forwardly placed early on, lost position on the backstretch run, came three wide along the
second turn, did not mount a rally in the drive and just missed for the show. SLUMBERING BEAUTY threw her head leaving the start and was a bit slow into
stride, settled three wide along the first turn, came four wide along the second turn, swung widest into the stretch run and passed tiring foes in the drive. KID
DEELITES saved ground while settling off of the early pace, lost position on the second turn and was not a factor. HILLSDALE NATION was eager in the
early stages and came four wide into the first turn, challenged the pace into the backstretch run then took a narrow edge to the half-mile marker, was
overtaken by the winner nearing the top of the stretch, stayed on into the final furlong but tired in the late stages. DEAREST BARBARA stalked the pace
from the midflight, was three wide on the first turn, maintained position into the second turn to come four wide nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in
upper stretch and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
SUMMER APPARITION stalked the moderate pace from midpack, was three wide into the backstretch run, was roused three wide nearing the quarter
marker, came within aim nearing the furlong grounds, overtook the pacesetter approaching the sixteenth pole and drew clear late. FANTASTIC SECRET
broke alertly and was sent to the front, set moderate fractions while on a clear lead into the second turn, was clear into the final furlong but was caught
nearing the sixteenth-marker and outfinished, while besting the rest. BRITE TAN stalked the early pace from a ground saving position, lost ground while two
wide on the second turn, was put to firm urging in upper stretch, shifted out and re-rallied leaving the furlong marker but was outfinished in the end, while
dead-heating for third. FIRE DIAMONDS settled three wide off of the early pace on the first turn, mounted a three wide bid on the second turn, advanced in
upper stretch did not have a final kick in the drive. NORTHERN ROSE was unhurried in the early stages, was steered to go two wide into the second turn
and lacked a late response. SLEW OF FASHION was prominent in the early going, stalked the pace through the backstretch run, lost ground on the second
turn and faded through the late stages.
