Footnotes
HAIL FREEDOM sped clear and angled to the two path, maintained a comfortable lead through the far turn, then widened under hand urging through the
lane. QUICK BUCK was closest in pursuit from the two path, ridden along the far turn, could not make any headway on the winner but was clearly second
best. HAPI HAPI stumbled leaving the gate, lagged behind three to four wide on the first turn, remained wide to the stretch and bested the rest. WINE AND
WHISKY chased two wide under coaxing early, came out at the five-eighths pole, went three then two wide on the second bend, angled out into the stretch
and failed to menace. AUTISMS WORLD chased three wide around the first turn, two to three wide into the stretch and came up empty. RECKONING DAY
fractious in the gate, broke slow, tugged along the rail on the first turn and into the backstretch, saved ground through the second bend under urging and
tired.

DANCING CRANE sped to the front and set the pace up the backstretch, took some pressure while moving to the two path on the turn, moved clear again
at the quarter pole and held well under right-handed urging. GALLOVIE (GB) forwardly placed in the early going, applied pressured two wide on the turn but
lost touch with a quarter mile to go, chased three wide into the lane, continued within striking distance through the drive and finished willingly to closed the
gap late. RED DIAMOND off slow and bumped with rival leaving the gate, saved ground while out of range, angled out in the stretch and put in a mild late
bid to earn the show honors. NU PI LAMBDA stalked off the rail then angled down to the inside, cut the corner into the stretch and needed to find more in
the final furlong. SHEZA GIRLY GIRL trailed on the inside early on, moved out in the stretch and passed a tired rival. EQUILOVE (IRE) stumbled and
bumped leaving the gate, chased outside a rival then off the rail, went two wide through the turn and faded.

THERE GOES HARVARD settled inside then moved to the two path on the clubhouse turn, took closer order up the backstretch, tipped three wide around
the second bend, drifted inward in upper stretch and drew alongside DEFUNDED with a furlong remaining, took over in midstretch and edged away under
left-handed urging. DEFUNDED chased STILLETO BOY from inside then moved up to taken control, set the pace on the inside, cut the corner into the
stretch, confronted by THERE GOES HARVARD at the eighth pole, relinquished command in midstretch and stayed on well from inside. ROYAL SHIP
(BRZ) sat off the pace in three path, moved closer outside THERE GOES HARVARD on the backstretch, chased four wide into the lane and faltered in the
furlong grounds. STILLETO BOY away well from outside, had early speed then raced up close outside DEFUNDED through the early stages, chased that

Footnotes
COUNT AGAIN broke a step slow, trailed two wide into the clubhouse turn then moved to the rail, advanced between rivals then tipped three wide on the far
turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, headed the runner-up with a furlong left to run and powered clear. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT prompted the pace from
outside, took over past the three-eighths pole, kicked clear and angled to the inside, headed by COUNT AGAIN at the eighth pole, could not keep up with
that rival in the final furlong but stayed on for a clear second. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS settled inside, crept closer up the backstretch, got blocked and
steadied behind a weakening DANCE SOME MO on the far turn, tipped to the two path path the five-sixteenths and ran on to gain the show. HEYWOODS
BEACH stalked outside a rival, between rivals to the far turn, moved inside late on the far turn and lacked further response in the stretch run.
RESTRAINEDVENGENCE sat off the pace three wide early, chased outside a pair of rivals in the middle stages, asked three wide around the far turn and
came up empty. DANCE SOME MO set the pace on the inside under pressure, lost command past the three-eighths pole, started to weaken around that
turn and tired.

and drew clear. TEQUILA TIGRE was off slow and bobbled at the start, , moved into range, bid three deep into the turn, dueled outside a rival past the
five-sixteenths pole, led into the stretch, lost command past the eighth pole and was clearly second best. MIX AND MATCH tossed his head leaving the
gate, sat off the pace, went two to three wide around the turn, came out in the stretch and was along for the show. MISS BAYLEE away quickly in the
beginning, was closet in pursuit up the backstretch, bid at the seven-sixteenths pole, took over then dueled from inside on the turn, lost contact at the top of
the stretch and flattened to fourth. CAL broke a bit slow and got forced out a bit at the start, chased outside rivals then four wide around the turn and
weakened. NO PEOPLE off a bit slow in the beginning, raced off the pace on the inside then two wide on the turn, tipped out in the stretch and failed to
menace. ROSIE THE CAT shifted out leaving the gate, trailed along the inside through the turn and was not a factor. BABY KRISTEN off bit slow then sent
clear, set the pace up the backstretch, challenged nearing the turn, lost command at the three-eighths and gave way. QUICK TAKE broke a step slow from
inside, chased along the fence then checked at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back and eased off the rail around the turn, came four wide into the drive

Footnotes
ISOLA MIA controlled the pace on the inside, took pressure on the far turn, maintained a short lead over the runner-up in the drive and drew clear in the final
sixteenth. SUNNY MORNING (FR) stalked outside a rival then three deep past the half-mile pole, bid from outside on the far turn, challenged through the
lane but was turned away in deep stretch. SUPER RENEE broke out and brushed rival leaving the gate, forwardly placed in the two path, remained two
wide to the stretch and lacked late response. KITTEN CALLS stumbled leaving the gate, tracked two wide, checked off heels past the three-eighths pole,
tipped out to three path and gained a minor award while never threatening. ROXBURY pulled early on the first turn on the inside, checked when put in tight
entering the far turn, fought the rider and steadied again at the quarter pole and made no impact in the stretch. VIOLET STORM got brushed from inside
leaving the gate, steered to the inside then moved out into the backstretch, rounded the far turn three then two wide and weakened. VULIN settled on the
inside, got put in a bit tight at the three-eighths pole, shifted to the two path and was not a factor.

RECALL AND RELOAD broke a bit slow then went up to duel for command, battled through the turn holding a slim advantage over outside rivals, lost
command in upper stretch but fought back and cleared FAMOUS STAR with a sixteenth remaining and held over the late charge from SHOW TIME in the
closing moments. SHOW TIME settled off the pace, went three to four wide around the turn, steered out in the lane, rallied but was too late. FAMOUS STAR
away quickly from outside, attended the pace outside the top in the early going, challenged three deep with a quarter mile remaining, took over in upper
stretch but drifted out in the final furlong and flattened to third. CHAOS REIGNS dueled for command from outside then vied between rivals late on the turn,
then weakened in the stretch run. ANAHEIM stumbled and brushed with inner rival at the start, trailed near the inside around the bend and failed to menace.
STILL ON THE BOOKS brushed with rival leaving the gate, well placed behind the top trio up the backstretch, went two then three wide around the bend,
came out at the top of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
MUBTADAA stalked outside a rival early on, tipped four wide crossing the dirt, bid from outside in upper stretch, took over midstretch, then cleared and
drifted to the rail in the final sixteenth. CANE CREEK ROAD pressed the pace from outside in hand, led three wide into the stretch, fought with the winner to
the sixteenth pole and yielded. LANSDOWNE (GB) stalked along the inside, moved out and came three wide into the stretch, raced in traffic behind the
leaders in upper stretch, tipped to a clear path and held the show. ADARE off slow in the beginning, raced three deep into the turn, steered out and entered
the lane six wide and failed to rally. CEES GET DEGREES settled early, went two wide into the turn then moved to the rail, lacked room room near the
half-mile pole, gained a clear path, tipped two wide in the drive and failed to threaten. CALI BAY (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, raced between into the
turn, angled four wide across the dirt and failed to respond in the drive. NEWPARK (IRE) set the pace on the inside with accompanied by CANE CREEK
ROAD, lost the lead leaving the dirt and weakened down the lane. BUTKUS was off slow from inside, went three wide into the turn, moved down to the two
path around the bend then came four wide into the stretch and was never a factor.
