Footnotes
SUZY Q THE QUEEN prompted the pace inside, cued while tipping in to the two path rounding the far turn, headed the pacesetter coming into the final
furlong and drew clear. ADRIANA ES BONITA set the early pace two wide, opened up rounding the far turn, was challenged by the eventual winner heading
into the final furlong, and gave way. DRINK THE TAP pressed the pace three wide, was ridden along the four path around the far turn, and improved
position in the stretch. CELESTIAL DIVA chased while three wide early, steadied while three wide passing the half mile pole, tipped into the six path for the
stretch and improved. ALL THE WAY MAE tracked from the two path, saved ground along the far turn, but flattened. BUFFUM'S BEAUTY broke out of the
gate during the loading process, stalked between foes, but was tired rounding the far turn. NORMALIZEDDEVIANCE bobbled at the start and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
STORMBEAM rated from the rail, saved ground while ridden along the far turn, tipped out 3 wide to bid for the lead at the eighth pole and rallied to win.
MOSLER'S TOUCH set the pace from the 2 path, continued to race off the rail heading around the far turn, opened up into the stretch but was caught in the
final furlong. FOREST HALO chased between foes, was driven along while three wide around the far turn, and improved for show. LEA ME ALONE raced
off the pace in the two path, driven along while two wide around the far turn, but finished evenly in the stretch. HETTY G. stalked in the three path early, was
ridden along while tipping out to the six path coming into the stretch, but flattened. A TOAST TO KAY prompted the pace inside, nudged along while saving
ground around the far turn, but was tired. SING ALONG SUZY stumbled badly at the start, trailed, and never threatened. KIRBY also stumbled at the start,
was well back early, and lacked response.

Footnotes
REGAL REALM tugged to the fore to control the tempo, was collared on the second turn, turned back SEDUCE entering the stretch, shook clear and held
safely. SEDUCE tracked the winner to the outside, moved up to engage on the second turn, came to level terms with five-sixteenths to run, proved no match
for REGAL REALM but kept on willingly. DANCE ROUTINE was forwardly placed along the inside, got through every step, failed to seriously menace the
top two but churned willingly for the minor award. THISNAMEISOKAY contended four wide, offered a mild bid entering the stretch, but failed to make
headway. TEQUILERA settled between horses, moved up some on the second turn towards the inside, got through entering the stretch, but flattened in the
final furlong. DETERMINED HOPE was slow into stride, mounted an early move circling five wide, angled in entering the lane, but came up empty in the
drive. SHE SO COOL was unhurried early, angled out on the second turn and finished with a belated improvement. COME ON KITTY CAT settled between
horses and was never a factor. IMAGINTHEKISS brushed the gate, moved up quickly three wide, was within striking distance through the second turn, but
faltered between foes and dropped out. DR. CALKINS tucked in early, advanced between rivals on the backstretch, checked from tight quarters near the
three furlong marker and came up empty thereafter. SULTRY SKY saved ground to no avail.

RAISE A SPEIGHTS set the pace while off the rail, was coaxed when headed by an inside rival midway around the turn, and held gamely. JACK A ROSE
sat the picket early, made steady progress while inside around the turn, hooked up with the eventual winner for the stretch, and ran on. HIS ROYAL G
pressed the leader form the three path, roused while racing in the three path around the far turn, but was even down the stretch. GREGORIA'S BAY was
well back early, saved ground around the far turn, but was one paced. MISSION KEY trailed early and was never a threat. EDMUND FITZGERALD tracked
from the three path, raced in the four path into the stretch, but was empty.

AFANDI rated inside early, raced in the two path around the turn, tipped out four wide at the three sixteenths pole, and rallied. KITTEN'S COVERGIRL
raced in the mid pack early, coaxed while three wide coming into the stretch, ran on for place. CINDY'S PRAYER was sent to the lead, cut the corner
heading into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. PROPER MANNERS tracked from the two path early, was driven along the three path rounding the
turn, but was even in the stretch. LUCKY LIZZIE was back early on the rail, raced in the four path heading into the stretch, and had a mild gain.
UNTOUCHED ELEGANCE stalked from the rail, coaxed while racing inside along the turn, but was one paced in the stretch. AWESOME VIEW raced off
the pace in the two path, raced in the path heading into the stretch, but had no response. MASHUGANA trailed throughout.

Footnotes
ZEN MASTER was forwardly placed along the inside, shifted out leaving the turn, reeled in CAPT. CANDY near the furlong marker and kicked away. CAPT.
CANDY sped clear to dictate terms, fought on willingly but was unable to resist the winner. UNDER THE RADAR was unhurried while saving ground, angled
out leaving the turn, came four wide and was just up to earn the minor award. MUST BE LOVE stalked the pace, came three wide to make a mild bid, but
lacked the needed late response. RUNANDHIDE WIND settled saving ground, got through but failed to respond when called upon. MY HANDSOME MAN
was never a factor. LOYAL TO THE GAME contended three wide for a half and dropped out.

Footnotes
SIMMS was unhurried and raced in the two path, coaxed while making progress 3 wide around the turn, and rallied to win. HANFORD tracked while three
wide early, made steady progress racing three wide around the far turn, and ran on for place. MACKENZIE'S NOVVA set the contested pace, cued when
challenged around the far turn, continued to battle inside under a drive and held show. CURTEIS raced from behind and in the rail early, made progress well
ridden around far turn, fanned six wide into the lane, and improved position. DELTA RIDGE raced off the pace and three wide, was driven along four wide
into the stretch, but was tired. UNION FLEET trailed inside early, was driven along while making progress four wide around the far turn, but was even in the
stretch. REEL WELL was well back and two wide early, was behind and two wide into the far turn and was one paced. BUSHWICK BRUISER rated in the
two path, was cued while three wide rounding the far turn, but flattened. LUKIE DOOKIE stalked between early, but was tired coming into the stretch.
WHIZWIT raced in mid pack off the rail, tipped three wide into the stretch, but lacked response. TUCKER ROAD pressed the early pace, was ridden to keep
up along the turn, but was empty. LAW OF THE JUNGLE sat the pocket, backed out far turn.

Footnotes
LIFESPAN pressed the pace three wide, driven along while vying for the lead three wide around the far turn, and drew clear late. I AM IT prompted the pace
inside, roused while saving ground around the far turn, and was second best. SPEIGHTSTER RED set the pace, roused when headed midway around the
far turn, held show. AUSTIN WHYLIE rated from the four path, driven along while four wide into the stretch, and improved position. TINY TIN raced well
back early, driven along in the two path around the far turn, but flattened. CHIEF CHARLIE tracked on the inside, saved ground around the far turn but was
tired in the stretch. ROCKY DICE chased inside but was no menace. MAKOTO raced off the pace and two wide, but was empty down the stretch. RAMIRIN
was well behind and took no part.
