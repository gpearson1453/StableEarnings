the lane and had no kick. COLOR FORCE was reserved early, then was four to five wide on the far turn and had no rally. ABHAILE was four wide into the

NO EASY ANSWER went up to set the pace while clear, then widened the margin leaving the turn, then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best
under mild confident urging. QUEEN LUCKY was reserved early two wide, then advanced on the inside on the turn, angled off the inside in the drive and
was gaining late. GO HALAINN was reluctant to load, tracked the winner three wide, made a mild bid on the turn and floated out wide leaving the turn and
then faded in the drive while racing green. GETAWAY PALACE chased the early pace four wide, then shifted in three wide leaving the turn, then angled out
five wide leaving the furlong marker, then shifted back to the inside leaving the sixteenth pole, no rally.

KILIMANJARA was well placed early on the inside, steadied slightly nearing the seven sixteenths, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane,
closed well on the outside to get up in time under drive. PERFECT HIDEAWAY pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for
command three wide by the quarter pole to the furlong marker, then edged clear and led late but was denied on the wire to just miss. AWESOME PAL was
rated along early, then moved to the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside in the lane, rallied well late while in traffic. QUEEN'S DREAM set a pressured
pace on the inside early, then dueled for command on the in side to the furlong marker, then faded late, lost show award late. LIKEUONLYPRETTIER was
unprepared and then dwelt at the start, no factor.

SCARLET LILY was well placed throughout on the inside, awaited room leaving the quarter pole, made a inside bid leaving the turn, hit the front nearing the
furlong marker and then drew out to prove much the best while being ridden out. SWEET AND MACHA broke in at the start, stalked the pace three wide,
made a four wide bid leaving the turn and then proved to be no match for the winner while being second best. OUR GOLDEN COLLEEN set the pace on the
inside, then came three wide into the lane and weakened, bested rest. VALENTINA'S CUPID broke outward at the start, settled early four wide, came five
wide into the drive and had no rally. FREE TO RUN squeezed back at the start, chased the pace four wide and then came up empty in the drive.

ACE NINE NINE was reserved early, then was three wide on the turn, shifted out and was roused leaving the quarter pole, swung out five wide into the lane
and closed well to get up in time under a drive. BEYOND THE BEND was settled early on the inside, eased out at the five sixteenths, made a four wide bid
and was clear by the furlong marker but was caught late to just miss. HASHTAG WINNING was bumped hard at the start, settled back early, advanced on
the turn into contention, came six wide into the lane and rallied but needed more late. MINE THE COIN tracked the early pace and made a mild bid on the
inside entering the stretch but had no late kick. KITTEN'S SOLUTION tracked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and faded.
WILD CARAMELO was away alertly and set a fast pace towards the inside and then gave way in the drive.
