Footnotes
FUNNY FELINE sped to the front, showed the way around the turn near the inside, lugged out crossing the dirt, straightened course and stayed clear to the
wire. CURRENT MOOD sat off the pace in the early going, angled in for the turn, came off the rail and entered the stretch three wide, could not threaten the
winner in the late stages but was clearly second best. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA was off a bit slow from inside, chased two wide on the turn, angled wide
following the lugging out winner across the dirt, could not go on with the top pair late but was able to save the show. SUNSHINE BABE stumbled leaving the
gate, trailed along the inside through the turn and missed the show. PALEO'S PRINCESS got put in a bit tight along the outside rail early and had to pause
briefly, tracked four wide into the turn, drifted out crossing the dirt and failed to rally. KO OLINA stalked the pacesetter off the inside, went three wide into the
bend, exited five wide and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
CARMELITA'S MAN broke a step slow then settled in the three path on the first turn outside a rival, went two wide into the second bend then angled out to
the four path, closed in from outside and drew alongside the leaders with a sixteenth remaining and got up late. JIMMY BLUE JEANS stumbled a bit but was
quick into stride, went two wide on the clubhouse turn then tugged the rider forward to challenge LOUD MOUTH from outside, dueled with that rival up the
backstretch and around the far turn, inched ahead at the quarter pole, held a short lead approaching the eighth pole, brushed with IRISH HEATWAVE
shortly after, resisted into the final sixteenth, then drifted out a bit and was overtaken by the winner. IRISH HEATWAVE broke a step slow in the beginning,
reserved in the early stages, roused with a quarter mile left to run, tipped out at the top of the stretch, bid three deep upper stretch, brushed with JIMMY
BLUE JEANS inside the eighth pole, then got floated out by that rival late and could not find the needed late kick. LOUD MOUTH sped to the front from
inside, dueled with JIMMY BLUE JEANS up the backstretch and far turn, fought back to the eighth pole then gave in late. PRODIGAL SON stalked the pace
three wide, coaxed around the far turn while losing positions and weakened down the lane. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN
BETWEEN JIMMY BLUE JEANS AND IRISH HEATWAVE, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT BOTH RIVALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT AND
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE.

DESMOND DOSS was off a bit slow to start, stalked the top pair between rivals to the turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend, bid from outside with a
furlong to go, took over past the eight pole and won going away. FASHIONABLY FAST set the pace while pressure from outside, got headed by GOOD
WITH PEOPLE midway around the turn, clung to a short lead to the eight pole, relinquished command to the winner shortly after and stayed on to secure
second. TIGRE DI SLUGO tracked three deep early, came four wide into the drive, took aim four deep approaching the eighth pole but lacked the needed
late kick. GOOD WITH PEOPLE pressed the pace from outside, challenged at the five-sixteenths marker, led exiting the turn, lost command in upper stretch
and gave way. MOOSE MITCHELL stalked the pace along the rail into the turn, dropped back and drifted four wide around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
BALLY'S CHARM sped clear and steered to the inside, controlled the pace through the early stages, coaxed with a quarter mile remaining, then drew off
under left-handed urging. ROYAL 'N RANDO pulled and bumped rival first time through the stretch, continue to fight the rider around the clubhouse turn,
tugged between riders on the backstretch, chased two wide into the lane and rallied for the place. SMUGGLER'S RUN stalked in the two path or outside a
rival, remained two wide leaving the far turn and set his sights on the leader nearing the stretch, moved out in the drive, failed to threaten the winner and
was edged for the place. WORSE READ SANCHEZ broke a step slow, unhurried early on three wide, went three deep into the far turn, steered to the two
path around that bend but failed to rally in the stretch run. SO I'M TOLD rated along the inside early on, urged through the far turn while saving ground and
never found the needed response. VINCERO GRANDE broke a bit slow, pulled first time through the stretch then got bumped and had to check, trailed two
wide around the first turn, three wide into the lane and made no impact.

CHIPPER was off a bit slow in the beginning, moved into range off the rail, waited patiently on the turn then angled in entering the stretch, bid inside the
leader and got put in tight briefly by that rival, still manage to slip through and gain the lead at the eight pole, then cleared outside rivals and drew away. SIX
FEET chased between rivals, two wide around the turn, bid three deep at the eighth pole but could not match the winner late. BAG'S GOLD broke in and
bumped rival, chased five deep into the turn, exited the bend four wide, put in a bid in upper stretch but faltered in the late stages. DISKO TRIBUTE shifted
in at the start, tracked seven deep early, went six wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch, kept on through the final furlong and earned a minor
award. TRIBAL DANCING sped to the front then crossed to the inside, set all the pace to the stretch, drifted in a bit in upper stretch, lost command at the
eight pole and folded. ROGUE SON threw his head and came away a bit slow, dropped back early, went five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path
around the bend, steered out in the lane and improved position. BUTTONWOOD TREE broke out and bumped rival leaving the gate, chased outside a pair
of rivals early on, remained three wide through the turn and weakened. PROJECTILE coaxed early then lost path and began to climb, went four then three
wide around the turn, came out in the stretch and made no impact. ECONOMICAL got bumped from both sides at the start, traveled in range four deep to
the turn, entered the lane three wide and weakened. MR FREEBIE drifted out soon after the start but was quickly corrected, forwardly placed early then lost
his path when the pacesetter crossed over, chased along the rail to the stretch and faded.

RAGING WATERS settled in mid-pack, moved into the two path on the turn, steered out and angled widest in the stretch, closed fast from outside and drove
clear. MINISTER SHANE stalked off the rail then angled in on the turn, bid along the inside and got bumped by CAERULEAN in upper stretch, took over
briefly in midstretch but was soon passed by the winner and stayed on to secure second. CAERULEAN got bumped leaving the gate, pressed the pace from
inside then dueled around the turn, cleared briefly into the lane, came in and bumped rival in upper stretch, clung to the lead with a furlong remaining, lost
command in midstretch and was outfinished for the place honors. NOLONGERAHOBBY forwardly placed early, angled into the three path on the turn,
exited the dirt five wide, bid outside the top pair at the eight pole but lacked the needed late kick. BIG FLAME broke a step slow, sat off the pace two or
three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. EL DIABLO ROJO was off slow to begin, traveled along the inside then moved to the two path and could not
rally in the drive. FORGIVING SPIRIT stumbled then broke in and bumped rival, went up to take the early lead, dueled outside a rival around the turn,
lugged out crossing the dirt and weakened in the lane. MAJESTIC WIND threw his head and was off slow to begin, traveled three wide early on the turn
then moved out and came five wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
BIG SWITCH away quickly in the beginning, chased the top pair into the turn, angled off the rail and went outside the pacesetter three wide on the
clubhouse turn, pressed early on the backstretch then moved up to challenge for command, gained the lead at the seven-sixteenths pole, disposed of IT'S
SIMPLE past the five-sixteenths pole, steered out to the three path leaving the far turn, urged right-handed with a furlong to go and drew off under steady
handling. ROSE MADDOX stumbled badly leaving the gate, tracked along the inside then two wide early, took closer between rivals in the middle stages,
tipped to the outside of the leader leaving the far turn and entered the lane four wide, failed to threaten the winner in the drive but was clearly second best.
YOUTEYOURHONOR broke out, stalked three then four wide early, raced up close outside the top pair entering the far turn, got floated five wide leaving
the far turn, flattened in the lane but was well clear of next rival. EVERLYS GIRL dueled for command inside a rival into the first turn, ceded control to IT'S
SIMPLE midway around the bend, stalked along the inside to the far turn, started to weaken around the bend and came up empty in the drive. IT'S SIMPLE
stumbled and broke out, dueled outside a rival into the first turn then took control around the bend but was soon pressured by BIG SWITCH, dueled with
that rival on the backstretch, lost command at the seven-sixteenths pole, could not keep up past the five-sixteenths pole, chased inside to the stretch and
weakened. ROMAN EMPRESS dropped back early, trailed three to four wide on both turns and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ALICE MARBLE bumped outside rival at the start, stalked in hand on the inside, got bumped near the five-sixteenths and blocked behind SUPER GAME on
the far turn, tipped out and found room in upper stretch, flew late and overhauled FLYING TO THE LINE in the final fifty yards. SASSYSERB settled on the
inside, moved to the two path for the second bend, got pinballed between rivals at the five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into the stretch, moved further
out and finished gamely but was outkicked by the winner. FLYING TO THE LINE set all the pace on the inside to the stretch, led clear into the final sixteenth
and got run down by the top pair late. SELF ISOLATION stumbled and bumped with ALICE MARBLE at the start, stalked three deep leaving the
backstretch, was closest in pursuit from the two path entering the stretch but could not summon the needed late kick in the final furlong. PULPIT RIDER
reserved in the early going, moved out four deep on the backstretch, angled down to the two path on the far turn, got crowded between rivals and shuffled
back midstretch and could not regain momentum. SUPER GAME pulled a bit early and was forwardly placed in the two path, moved to the inside on the far
turn while under urging and never found the needed response. FI FI PHAROAH was off slow to begin, steered down to the inside at the back, moved out
and went three wide into the second turn, bumped with SASSYSERB twice at the five-sixteenths pole, exited the bend four wide and weakened.
