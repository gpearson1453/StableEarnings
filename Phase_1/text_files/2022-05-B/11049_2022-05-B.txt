LA LOLA broke alertly, clear into the first turn, set a pressured pace onto and up the backstretch, put that rival away as the winner was challenging turning
for home, proved no match in the drive, well clear of the other runner. VANCOUVER SNOW allowed the pace to go early off the inside, continued unhurried
up the backstretch, ranged up to quickly challenge midway on that bend, narrowly showed the way into the lane from the outside, drew out steadily to the
wire while being kept to pressure. TRACK QUEEN chased the runner up into the first turn, moved up to pressure that one the middle half,gave way turning
for home, well back.

Footnotes
ELISHER outrun in the early going, ranged up to challenge four wide turning into the stretch, gained the advantage when straightened for home, extended
that advantage inside the furlong grounds then held the runner up safe late. UNDERDOG broke back, lacked speed while racing three wide through the
turn, steered out widest in upper stretch, rallied willingly to be closing the gap on the winner late. MIDNIGHT SPIRIT back off the pace while saving some
ground, moved closer along the inside and in traffic late in the turn, slipped through along the rail to briefly challenge nearing the furlong marker, flattened
out and was unable to contain the runner up late. GUILTY AGAIN set or forced the pace closest to but not on the inside, headed late backstretch, regained
a slight advantage late in the turn, allowed MIDNIGHT SPIRIT the rail into the lane and began to weaken. SHANGHAI BROTHER broke in good order,
helped set the pace between horses for four furlongs and faltered in the drive. SEMI CHARMED LIFE broke a step slow and awkwardly, remained back.
JIMMY TWO TIMES broke on top, with the pace three wide and outside for a half, gave way turning for home.

Footnotes
GENERAL EISENHOWER in the second flight closest to the inside in the run up the backstretch, came in the two path for the drive when beginning to
advance on the leader, challenged from the outside with less than a furlong remaining, edged clear under steady handling. CONQUISTADOR GOLD also in
the second group, raced between rivals, three wide into the lane, rallied for the place to gain the nod, no threat to the winner. PLAY MASTER last to leave,
continued void of speed out of the chute, remained back into and through the turn while saving ground, rallied up the rail to narrowly miss the place.
MAGNOLIA RIDGE broke alertly, shook. clear out of the chute, maintained a daylight advantage through the turn and upper stretch, caved when confronted
inside the furlong grounds. MULTIDIMENSIONAL in the second flight while widest, four path into the lane, had little left for the run to the wire. BARNEY'S
PASSION lacked speed, failed to muster a rally when remaining back. COCAL broke out, raced well outside in the main body up the backstretch, got out
turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
HOLY WAR in mid pack early toward the inside, steered out to be three wide when asked along late in the turn, shifted out a bit further nearing the furlong
marker, brisk handling, up in time in a determined effort. KASEN'S SISTER dueled up front closest to the inside, disposed of the other speed when
straightened for home, continued to lead late, caught in the final strides. SWIMHARD DREAMBIG vied early, fell back off the dueling leaders, continued to
save ground into the lane, mild rally up the rail, not enough in the late going to serious challenge. JOEY'S SASSY SHANA back off the early pace, came
four wide into the stretch, improved position slightly, not a threat to the top three. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY broke forwardly, vied up front early outside,
dueled in the two path and outside the runner up turn, first to blink entering the stretch. QUICK HEAT in the main body off the inside, had little for the drive.
AGIRLNAMEDSYD void of speed, came five wide out of the turn, failed to muster a closing kick. EASTER GIRL a bit rank at the start, remained always
back to be outrun. HAND TIME FROM GATE OF 1:21.21 INDICATES THAT THE ELECTRONIC FRACTIONS AND FINAL TIME ARE TOO FAST.

WISE ANCHOR broke out a bit, dueled up front off the inside, held a slight advantage into the lane, drifted out to brush with JANETS JAY JAY with a furlong
to run, outlasted that one in the run to the wire. JANETS JAY JAY behind the dueling leaders off the inside into the turn, advanced and challenged outside
WISE ANCHOR approaching midstretch, floated out and brushed by that one, outkicked in the final strides. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER back off the pace well
out in the strip, four wide into the lane, staged a mild rally to annex the show while remaining well out in the strip, not a serious threat to the top two.
GOLDEN PALACE came in early to intimidate BIG RESULTS, dueled inside entrymate into the turn, began to weaken when straightened for home,
continued to faltered as was caught for the show. BIG RESULTS tentative along the inside up backstretch, faded when clear for the drive, well back.
FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF JANETS JAY JAY
AGAINST WISE ANCHOR FOR INTERFERENCE, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND.

KISS GOODBYE off the pace while racing outside, ranged up three wide to challenge in the turn, showed the way into the stretch and kicked well clear
under steady handling. LOVE THAT STAR showed the way early, dueled inside the winner late in the turn, could not keep pace through the stretch, clearly
second best. GOOD GIRL SHORTY pressed the runner up from the outside up the backstretch, fell back off that one midway on the turn, continued to
gradually weaken through the lane, narrowly held the show. SADIE'S PORT off a step slow, trailed most of the way, not enough late to capture the show
spot. K V SQUARED back off the pace, roused late in the turn toward the inside, steered out, failed to respond and then faded the final furlong.

RIGHTANDJUST showed the way into the first turn, relinquished the advantage before a quarter, chased that rival up the backstretch, inherited a clear
advantage when that foe fell nearing the half mile marker, breather far turn, coasted home through the stretch while being kept to task. PIPES AND DRUMS
bothered at the break, raced well back while out in the strip, came four wide out of the final turn, rallied to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner.
NEW EAGLE in the second flight while toward the inside, steadied when attempting to avoid a stricken rival midway up the backstretch, recovered and
continued to save ground through the second bend, finished up best of the rest. FORTUITY forwardly placed for much of the way, lacked a closing punch
when called on in the stretch. UNION STATION broke back, angled to the inside, bothered then steadied attempting to avoid a fallen foe approaching the
four furlong marker, went evenly after recovering. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL in mid pack early, had little left for the drive. OVERDELIVER well wide early,
bothered slightly midway up the backstretch, stopped, far back, jogged accross. BOLD THIRST bothered at the start, moved up, angled to the inside to take
command before a quarter, fell midway on the backstretch, vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE INCIDENT ON THE
BACKSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
KING MARVIN broke slowly, moved up in the run into the turn, dropped inside, saved ground into the lane, rail bid, drew clear while kept to pressure. BIG
SESSY away in good order, with the pace between the entrymates up the backstretch and into the turn, fell back a bit into the lane, came back for the
second spot while unable to match the winner. MY LITTLE JUNIOR with the pace three wide and widest of the first flight, floated out to be four wide while
still contending into the lane, also refired a bit late to come back for the show. CLASSIC RED RACER narrowly set the early pace closet to the inside,
appeared to come out a bit to enter the stretch in the two to three path, continued to hold a slight advantage past the furlong marker while allowing the
winner the inside, gave way late to lose several positions. ETBAUER'S SECRET mid pack while three wide, lacked a closing response. ITALIAN PRINCE
finished early, was well back when getting out midway on the turn, trailed home. FREED broke alertly, fell back along the inside, pulled up late in the turn,
vanned off.
