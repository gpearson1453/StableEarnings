Footnotes
GENUINE KITTEN away in good order, clear out of the chute onto the main course, set a relaxed pace under moderate pressure up the backstraight toward
but not on the inside, two path into the lane when clear once again, lugged out badly to the wire while being vigorously flagged with a right handed crop,
held the runner up at bay late. WINDSOR ACADEMY settled off the pace along the rail first turn, moved out, came three wide into the straight, angled in a
bit inside the lugging out winner, chased that one past the furlong marker, could manage little late gain while well clear of the others. MARVINS GOLD
chased the winner to that one's outside, crept slightly closer late on the backstretch, fell back off that rival through the second turn, went flat through the
stretch to finish best of the rest. BLAZE OF GRAY went one paced throughout while saving all the ground. WHEELS TURNING fell back to trail after the
start, two path for five furlongs, moved outside a fading rival into the far turn, never menaced. RONNIE'S REASONING last away, was a bit keen while four
wide into and through the first turn, gave way late on the backstretch, stopped and was distanced while jogging in.

Footnotes
MY GIRL SWEET broke on top, well clear out of the chute, set the pace firmly in hand for five furlongs along, pulled away through the stretch under her own
courage to win with something left. ALLSTAR MAGIC chased the winner out of the chute and up the backstretch, moved a bit closer in the two path into the
turn, proved no match in the stretch, clearly second best. GRACE'S GAL fell well back to trail immediately after the start, continued to lag into and through
the turn, picked off a single tiring rival while remaining inside. BEAR TOOTH PASS moved closer three wide late backstretch and into the turn, stopped
stretch, finished far back.

LACIS JEWEL in the second flight up the backstretch inside, continued to save ground early in the turn, angled out four wide turning for home when
mounting a bid, challenged widest past the furlong marker, strongly clear under steady handling. KAITLYN'S COURT broke out and took up at the start to
be off slowly, remained back well off the rail, floated out five wide by the winner turning for home when beginning a rally of her own, proved no match for the
winner late, willingly for the second spot. TAKENFORGRANTED in the second group outside the winner, advanced to challenge three wide late in the turn,
held the advantage a furlong out, flattened out and was unable to offer much resistance to the top two. ABIGAIL G dueled up front closest to the inside up
the backstretch and into the turn, continued to vie closest to the rail entering the stretch, gradually weakened in the run to the wire. CRIDER CHASE set or
forced the pace in the two path for five furlongs, faltered from between rivals entering the stretch. AUDACIOUS GIRL fell back to trail after the start and was
never a factor.

Footnotes
GLANCE three wide when forwardly placed past the wire the first time, tucked toward the inside first turn to save some ground, tracked the leaders up the
backstretch, covered up briefly midway on the second turn, steered out and accelerated to the fore entering the straight, shook. clear, enough left to hold the
runner up safe late. LIZZ A BEE void of speed, roused three wide into the lane, rallied and finished up willingly to be getting to the winner late. BLAZING
CHARM in mid pack along the inside, slipped through along the rail turning for home, briefly in tight then steadied along the fence upper stretch, quickly
recovered to hold the show late while not making much headway on the top two at the wire. ISOLATION got clear after an alert break to show the way into
the first turn, dueled the middle half remaining closest to the inside, offered brief resistance to the winner entering the stretch then began to weaken.
HAVINFUNYET last away, trailed well back for much of the way, improved a bit by picking off a couple of tiring rivals. KICK N KISS in mid pack, moved a bit
closer in the two path late in the final turn while in traffic, came up empty when clear for the drive. BAR TAP chased the early leader off the inside, dueled
the middle four furlongs in the two path, gave way when the real running began turning for home.

Footnotes
CUSTOM BLUE GRASS broke with the leaders, vied briefly then fell back off the issue while four wide, advanced and challenged the lead pack in the five
path turning for home, gained the advantage, drifted in to bother PRODUCTION TIME inside the furlong grounds under right handed encouragement then
edged clear under a continued right handed crop to the wire. WOODS N WATER bobbled just after the start, lacked speed while four wide up the
backstretch and into the turn, three wide late in that bend, swung out into the five path entering the stretch, finished well to be for the second spot down the
middle of the strip. PRODUCTION TIME with the lead while four wide in the run up the backstretch, continued to vie widest through the turn, put a head in
front late in the bend, raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch, floated in and bothered by that one nearing the sixteenth pole in turn causing a
tiring JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS to steady, caught late for the runner up position. JOHNNY BOOTLEGGS away in good order, set or forced the pace three
wide and between foes for almost four furlongs, was beginning to weaken inside the furlong marker when bothered and then steadied, continued to fade off
the leaders to the wire. MR. NUMERO UNO off slow, moved up steadily the opening furlong to contest the pace before a quarter, continued to do battle up
front along the fence, steadily weakened in the run through the stretch. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE also away slowly, moved up with MR. NUMERO UNO to
join the fray up front before a quarter, also faltered through the stretch to lose position. SASSY'S PROSPECTOR in mid pack and outside, five to six wide
through the turn, lacked a serious closing rally. CHEATIN CHARLIE broke alertly, fell back soon after and failed to menace while racing off the inside.
HIGHHOPES DIAMOND broke near the back and failed to menace. ANGOLA VACATION was never a factor toward the inside. ST JOE fell back to trail
after the start and showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY
THE RIDER OF PRODUCTION TIME AGAINST CUSTOM BLUE GRASS, THE LATTER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED THIRD.

Footnotes
EXACTA forwardly placed early while tucking to the inside in the first turn, allowed the two leaders to steal off to a long lead in the run up the backstretch,
began to advance on that pair midway on the final turn, collared the lone leader from the outside a furlong out and drove strongly clear. KIND WAYS chased
the early leader, engaged that one onto the backstretch from the two path, dueled the middle half, put that foe away turning for home to be well clear, could
not contain the winner, saved the place. LONE STAR DIVA settled in mid pack while saving ground for six furlongs, tipped out to the three path turning for
home, mounted a late run to be getting to the runner up in the waning strides. NIN TO WIN void of speed while saving all the ground, steered out around a
tiring foe exiting the final turn, improved through traffic with some late interest. GIRLS COUNT back off the pace and the inside, came with LONE STAR
DIVA for the drive outside that one in the four path, lacked a closing response. COINMAKER last to leave, void of speed, failed to threaten. KAPPA HILL
also broke back, failed to muster a closing response as well. EMPTY NET set the early pace inside, dueled the middle part then stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
BAYOU JAM outrun early while three wide through the first turn, moved closer before a half, four wide through the second turn when reaching a striking
position, took over approaching the furlong marker, dug in late when challenged from the outside by the runner up to narrowly prevail in game fashion.
SOBEK off slowly, well back in trailing early, four wide and behind the winner far turn, five wide into the lane, challenged outside the winner late, outkicked in
the late going to miss. END ZONE pressed the leader from the outside in the two path, vied between horses in the second turn, fell back to lose some
position into the stretch,shifted out a bit late and came back for the show. OCTOBER SURPRISE devoid of any early foot while saving ground first turn,
moved out, floated out six wide by the runner up turning into the stretch, failed to keep pace with that one to the wire, improved a bit with more subdued
energy through the lane. WAYPOINT closest to the leaders, advanced on that pair and challenged three wide second turn, showed the way into the lane
and past the furlong marker, caved when headed soon after. ROCK ON COWBOY broke alertly, set the pace inside, faltered when replaced on the lead in
the second bend. DUTCHMAN in the second flight for a half, gave way.

Footnotes
ACTION POTENTIAL pressed the issue for three furlongs, took over midway on the turn in the two path, held a narrow advantage past the furlong marker
between horses, found more late to be edging away at the end. SWEET TEMPERAMENT dwelt at the break to spot the field several lengths, was used to
work way up to within striking position along the inside by late in the turn, angled three wide into the and for room between horses, tried the winner from the
outside past the furlong marker but could not match that one late while holding the second spot. FLASHY MEG moved up to show the way up the
backstretch, raced on equal terms with the winner late in the turn then could not keep up, outkicked late for the second spot while remaining inside. SASSY
EMMA void of early foot while out in the strip, was angled out five wide into the lane, improved a bit while not a threat to the top three. MISS JAMIE within
striking distance, moved closer three wide in the turn, came four wide for the drive, lacked a closing response. DREAM ON IT off the pace and the inside,
fanned five wide into the lane, remained back.

Footnotes
LA JAZZ broke with the leaders, raced in the second flight up the backstretch off the inside, closer three wide turn, dueled into the lane in the two path, wore
down inner rival to be edging away late. MY AVANI forwardly placed off the inside, challenged off the inside turn, came into the lane dueling along the rail
with the winner, could not match that one the final sixteenth, well clear of the others.. LUCCA'S LILYBY mid pack and outside for a half, four wide through
most of the turn, mild interest lane, not a threat to the top two. MY DEPOSIT off slow, fell far back to be sluggish up the backstretch, improved position with
some late interest while never a serious threat. ALLEN'S JUDY void of speed, came four wide out of the turn, failed to rally. SHOOTING STICK broke out,
steadied a bit, recovered to move up inside and help set the pace for a half the gave way. JUST A WIN broke on top, set or forced the pace in the two path
for a half and stopped, finished far back.
