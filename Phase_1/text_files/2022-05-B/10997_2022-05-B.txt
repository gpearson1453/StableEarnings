WIN IN THE CITY dueled outside of COLORFUL NATIVE around the turn, battled on into the upper stretch, shook free approaching the furlong marker and
finished clear. NATIVE HELLRAISER tracked the embattled duo into the turn, launched a three wide bid into the upper stretch, angled in approaching the
sixteenth pole and finished second best. COLORFUL NATIVE dueled inside of WIN IN THE CITY in opening stages, battled on around the turn, could not
maintain equal terms with the winner approaching the furlong marker and weakened to show. MIDNIGHT RULES raced off the top trio, chased three wide
around the turn and just missed show. FLASH IN THE PAN lacked speed and raced in the back, was ridden along four wide into the upper stretch and failed
to rally. BIZZY RUN saved ground around the turn, tipped out a couple paths approaching the upper stretch and had no late response.

OIL MONEY took command after opening stages and held clear around the turn, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch, dug in late under an all
out drive and held on. ULTIMATE tracked the early leader and saved ground around the turn, given cue along the rail at the head of the lane, was inching
up on the winner in final strides and just missed. GOOD SCOUT raced two wide in contention tracking the leader around the turn, hustled along three wide
into the upper stretch, sustained steady response and secured a share. GREAT FACES raced in the back early on, hustled along three wide around the
turn, was ridden along three to four wide into the upper stretch and failed to kick on. PRINCIPE GUILHERME chased the pace into the turn, was ridden
along four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. MARQUEE THUNDER showed response in the opening quarter then gave way.

MAD TABBY was allowed to settle in early stages, saved ground around the turn, launched a rail bid in the upper stretch, dug in gamely under firm handling
and edged away. GLORY ROLL dueled inside of MY KIKI for the early lead, battled on around the turn, shook free in the upper stretch, held clear a furlong
out then got denied late. JAVISTHA raced off the early pace, launched a three to four wide bid in the upper stretch and produced a solid finish. MY KIKI
dueled outside of GLORY ROAD for the early lead and battled back around the turn, failed to maintain bid in the upper stretch and gave way. DIANNA'S
JET hustled along in pursuit of the top pair around the turn, flattened out in the upper stretch and ran on evenly. SOJOURNER TRUTH lacked speed and
raced in the back, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch and offered no late bid. THAT'S ALL RIGHT raced off the early pace, came three to four
wide into the upper stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
JERRY'S EIGHTY was nicely sitting just off the embattled trio around the turn, given cue four wide at the head of the lane, advanced into striking distance in
the final sixteenth, dug in under firm handling and got a nose up in final stride. DIAMOND RIM dueled three deep for the early lead, continued to battle with
FEEL THE FEAR in the stretch run, stayed on gamely and got nipped on the wire. FEEL THE FEAR dueled inside of rivals into the turn, continued to battled
back gamely from the inside down the lane and got edged out in final strides. KNOCKER DOWN got bumped at the start, tracked the top trio in early stages
then hustled up three wide into the upper stretch and ran on evenly. TWO GUNS lacked early speed, saved ground and failed to kick on. SIMPLY WICKED
dueled between rivals for the early lead, matched strides around the turn then came up empty in the upper stretch.

Footnotes
TOSKA'S RULER quickly cleared on top and angled inside, dictated terms by a clear advantage around the turn, stayed sharp in response and drew off
while ridden out. SING LOUD was forwardly placed in opening stages, chased the eventual winner three wide around the turn and stayed on through the
lane. COOL CAT CHARLIE raced off the early pace, hustled up four wide around the turn, came five wide into the upper stretch and gained a share.
GINGER RULES saved ground around the the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and needed more for late impact. IT'S ALL ABOUT JOE raced inside off
the early pace, came four wide into the upper stretch and improved position without threatening. STORM THE FIELD chased in contention along the inside
and flattened out in the lane. NASTY EXAGGERATOR chased two to three wide around the turn, steadied in the upper stretch then angled inside and failed
to move on. TEQUILA failed to move into contention. TOUGH AINT ENOUGH was forwardly place in early stages and tired in the drive.
