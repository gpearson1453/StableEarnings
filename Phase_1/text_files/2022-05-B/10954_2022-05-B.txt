Footnotes
MYLIES STAR away in good order, with the pace inside, soft duel inside the winner, could not match that one through the stretch,enough to last for the
place. ASK DALE in the second flight while racing in the two path, roused entering the stretch, not enough to catch entrymate for the place spot.
BARRANCA showed some early foot between the top two through the first turn, fell back onto the backstretch, finished after four furlongs. JERSEY HOTTIE
with the early pace three wide in the first turn, dueled up the backstretch through some soft splits, continued to alternate up front far turn, put the other
speed away entering the stretch, edged away under a steady right handed crop. STARSHIP NOLA last to leave, trailed for a half, was never dangerous.

Footnotes
GREEN MONSTER broke with the field, fell back and tracked the leader while along the inside, tipped out to the two path turning for home, set down, late
surge to be up in the final strides while between horses. ROMANTIC BEAST last away, trailed, floated out four wide turning for home, roused, rallied while
remaining widest, finished well while too late. DUEFORADATE took command and cleared to the inside the opening furlong, continued to show the way into
and through the turn along the rail, remained clear a furlong out, could not contain the top two. SEVEN JEWELS prompted the pace off the inside, came
three wide out of the turn, little left late to come up empty.

MAINTAINANCE MATT last away, raced unhurried up the backstretch, lodged a sudden move three to four wide to challenge entering the stretch, drew
clear, kept to task the final furlong to hold the runner up safe late. WILSON TO LOCKETT behind the pace off the inside roused in the three path behind the
winner who got the jump on him late in the turn, shifted out a bit to be widest for the drive, slowly getting to that same rival late, determined for the second
spot. LEMNISCATE narrowly set the pace closest to the inside, headed in quick fashion by the winner entering the stretch, chased that one past the furlong
marker, caught late for the place. INTERACTIF MOMENT dueled up front in the two path for a half, weakened through the stretch. MIDNIGHT BAYOU back
off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground through the turn, in some traffic turning for home, came up empty for the stretch run when clear.

Footnotes
DREWCITABLE forwardly placed three wide into the first turn, settled in the second flight while remaining off the inside the middle half, came four wide for
the drive, challenged while widest past the furlong marker, dueled to the wire, proved best in determined fashion. VARNISHED also in the second flight
while closest to the inside, raced in the two path into the lane well inside the winner, bid between foes with a furlong remaining, dueled to the wire,
outkicked. PAYDAY TOO lacked early foot inside, raced in the two path through the second turn and into the lane, drifted in under a right handed crop to
tighten up LOUISIANA MOON in upper straight, continued to with a rally to the finish to be slowly closing the gap on the top two. LOUISIANA MOON void of
speed along the inside, continued to save ground second turn and into the straight, put in tight then steadied when PAYDAY TOO drifted in, altered course
to the outside and improved position late. COMMANDER SCOTT took command after the start, set the pace inside, continued to show the way past in
upper straight, headed just inside the furlong marker and caved in to lose several position in the waning strides. SOCIAL AFLEET pressed the pace while
racing in the two path, gave way readily turning for home, continued to fade stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN
THROUGH UPPER STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MY GAL CHARLOTTE vied early outside, cleared after a furlong, held a daylight advantage through the turn, roused when straightened for home, enough
left to hold off the next two late. SONGS DISCREET CAT in the second flight inside, continued to save ground through the turn, moved out a bit and made a
late run on the winner to close the gap. SUNSET FLASH broke with the leaders, fell back afterward, four wide through the turn, rallied well out in the strip
late to finish up willingly. COSMIC BELLE a bit restless in the gate, settled off the pace inside, angled out to be three wide for the drive, displayed some
mild, belated interest. T J'S SUNSHINE within striking distance off the inside, chased the winner through the turn and into the stretch, weakened the final
furlong. DAVE'S RONDA off a step slow, trailed for three furlongs, came six wide out of the turn, remained widest in improving position with some belated
interest. LA DANTA broke well, fell back off the issue early, came five wide into the lane, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing punch. GALAXY
AFFAIR lacked speed along the inside, remained along the rail into the lane, made little impact to the wire. FLYING I in mid pack early, was three out to four
wide exiting the turn, failed to rally. BOSTON PROSPECT broke forwardly, chased the winner into the turn, began a steady fade before three furlongs.

Footnotes
FUNKYLITTLESHACK broke sharp, cleared to the inside, set all the pace, steadily drew out through the lane under under steadying handling in a solid
effort. CALIFORNIA CALI away in good order, raced closest to the winner up the backstretch, chased that one into the lane, proved no match, remained
clear for the place. SECRET MELODY settled off the pace just off the inside, eased out late in the turn to be four wide into the straight, angled in, modest
rally to finish up best of the rest. RYAN'S GRACE in mid pack while racing three wide, went flat through the lane in lacking a late response, outkicked for the
show. FLAWLESS TAKEOVER last away, continued to trail for four furlongs, picked off a couple of tiring rivals well after the issue had been decided.
IMMACULATE GLORY fell back after the start, raced outside, floated out five wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. SAKURA ALEXA forwardly
placed in the early going, steadily faded. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
COACH HUDSON broke with the leaders, stalked the dueling pair into and through the turn, engaged those two from the outside turning for home, long
drive to the wire, fully extended to narrowly prevail. CHAIRMAN MOO also away in good order, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to battle
along the rail past the furlong marker, proved stubborn to the end, game for the place. B W P SPECIAL moved up to duel soon after the start, alternated up
front through the turn, also responded when confronted by the winner entering the stretch, gave ground grudgingly between the top two late. BLAZING
CHARLIE broke back, went one paced while off the inside, asked along three wide through the turn, lacked a closing response through the lane. CLEVER
PRINCE last away, trailed, came four wide out of the turn, improved position with some mild late interest. HOPE FOR CHANGE off the pace, had little left
for the drive. LARRY DALE broke sharp, fell back while well wide, three wide exiting the turn, faded even furlong through the lane. SWEET DREAMS BABE
finished early inside, stopped into the lane, far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
EVERLOVINGHAND took command soon after the start, was clear after a soft opening quarter, continued to show the way up the backstretch, stayed clear
into and through the stretch while being kept to task. WISH UPON A STAR lacked early foot, moved closer up the inside before a half, dueled inside the
runner up second turn, put that one away for the second spot inside the furlong marker while not a threat to the winner. MARTINIZED chased the winner off
the inside, crept a bit closer to that one exiting the final turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch, weakened to lose contact with the runner up
late, remained well clear of the others. TOUCHDOWN JOE raced back off the pace, asked two path far turn, failed to respond in the drive. ORDER UP four
wide into the first turn when within striking distance, fell steadily back, well beaten.

Footnotes
CORBIN'S WILD ACES away well, forwardly placed in the second flight out of the chute and up the backstretch, ranged up to challenge the leader from the
outside far turn, took over then responded when the runner up came alongside into the lane, dueled to the wire, proved best under steady handling. AUNT
JANA never far back off the inside, ranged up to challenge on the outside of the winner into the lane, dueled past the furlong marker then was outfinished by
that same rival late, edged clear for the place. UNION GRAD settled off the pace and the inside, came three wide out of the turn, steered in a bit when
straightened for home, steadily getting to the top pair late. IT'S TIME BABY last away, trailed early, advanced into a more forward position through the turn,
came four wide into the stretch and then flattened out to be caught for the place. TAP YOUR FRONT forwardly placed early, began to weaken late in the
turn, continued to fade through the lane while in hand. REVOLUTIONARY LASS remained always back in failing to threaten. MORO DRAMA QUEEN broke
sharp, cleared before leaving the chute, stopped when headed by the winner far turn.
