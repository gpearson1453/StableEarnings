AMES MISTER pressed the pace for a half two wide, took command, set the balance of the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best
while being kept to task. ANGEL'S ENTRY trailed around the clubhouse turn, moved closer three wide into the far turn and finished well clear for second.
BIKO broke outward bumping a rival at the start, stalked the pace near the inside and failed to respond. NATURAL CHARM was bounced around between
rivals at the start then no factor. BAGE was no threat. FAST CALL was fractious in the gate prior to the start, bumped with NATURAL CHARM, set the pace
for a half then stopped.

BEER CHASER sped to the lead soon after the start, set all the pace, drifted to the six path under right handed urging in upper stretch, dug in gamely under
a strong hand ride in the final stages and prevailed. BISCUITS AND GRITS stalked the pace four wide, loomed boldly outside the winner in the seven path
in deep stretch and was denied. GARRETT never far back, passed tiring rivals. BULLION pressed the pace two wide for nearly a half then faded. VERIFIED
with the second flight two wide, failed to respond. IMPERIAL BREW had speed along the rail, offered a mild bid nearing the quarter pole then came up
empty. OPEN OUT trailed.

much the best. ONE GLAMOROUS GAL away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside into the stretch then was no match for the winner but held on
for second. CACKI never far back, had a mild late rally in the four path. SAMMY'S SISTER trailed into the stretch and closed a gap late in the three path.
SOLE FACTOR failed to menace. RAINBOW SHIP prompted the pace two wide into the turn, got out and dropped out of it. STAR MABEE vied for the lead
along the inside into the stretch then faltered.
