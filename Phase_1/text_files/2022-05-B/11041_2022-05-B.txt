Footnotes
SHACKLE CAT led between rivals, dueled on even terms into the stretch, repelled that challenge then drew away under left handed urging. EXPLAIN
chased off the pace, moved wide on the turn and rallied too late. ANGELUS DIAMOND prompted the pace outside, loomed a threat at the top of the lane
but weakened. GO FOR THE KILL settled just off the leaders wide and flattened out in the stretch. MR. TUTTLE dropped back inside and was never in
contention. FRANK N DUCKY forced the pace inside to the quarter pole and gave way. TEQUILA JR stumbled at the break and trailed throughout.

EASY DAY rated inside, slipped through to the front at the top of the lane and edged clear holding late challenge safe. MIDNIGHTCHARLY lacked speed
inside, advanced on the turn, posed danger but could not get by the winner. DAVIDIC LINE made a menacing three wide bid on the turn, led briefly then
flattened out. FEDERAL CASE dueled outside to the five sixteenths and weakened. FOREST FIRE trailed field to the stretch then caught fading rival.
JW'STRICKYMISCHIEF dueled inside rival with a narrow advantage then stopped.

willingly too late. HE RUNS THE LINE trailed along the inside and was never in contention. A GRAY FOR CAROLYN raced off the pace near the inside and
was never a factor. PETER G. FOX was ordered a late scratch on the advise of the track veterinarian.

MS CANELA raced close up, engaged the leader on the turn then edged ahead late and returned with a badly cut mouth. SYSTEMIC RISK hustled to the
front, moved clear briefly into the far turn then battled to the finish in a game try. AMBITIOUSLY PLACED saved ground close up, split foes on the turn then
made a mild inside gain. SHESASUPERFREAK raced close up inside, swung wide in the stretch and flattened out. ARTIE'S ROSE dropped back early then
passed rivals while no factor. RISQUE'S JEWEL trailed to the stretch then passed a fading rival. HOLLYWOOD GINA lacked speed inside and weakened
steadily. SILVER BANSHEE was urged close up four wide down the backstretch and gave way.
