GOOD SUGAR pressed then vied three wide through the turn and into the lane, was on near even terms with two others with an eighth to go, shook clear of
that duo and kept on to the wire to maintain the diminishing advantage. UNBRIDLED VICTOR was in the two path through the turn when in second flight,
angled into the five path into the lane and finished with good energy to be closing in late. BROOKVILLE DEPUTY vied for the lead from between rivals
through the turn, continued on near even terms just inside the eighth pole then could not keep up. DILLSBORO DEVIL vied from the inside of two others,
continued near the lead into the lane then faltered. ROCKIN ALL NIGHT was in the three path through the turn while between rivals, came into the lane from
the four path and never was a threat. SUDDEN SHIFT raced three wide and in the four path through the turn then tired in the lane.

Footnotes
SNOOTY set the pace from the two path through the turn, was challenged from the inside approaching the quarter pole, rider through reins to shake up his
mount into the lane, quickly opened clear lengths then was geared down from just inside the sixteenth pole and galloped to the wire while much the best.
WARIS raced along the inside through the turn, bid approaching the quarter pole, was no match for the winner through the lane but stayed on to be clear for
the show spot. KENZIE LOU was in the three or four path through the turn, came into the lane from the five path and offered a mild gain. BOO'S GAL
chased the pace from the three path into the lane and faded. WHAT'S SO FUNNY never a factor while along the inside. MISSISSIPPI MUSE raced far back
into the lane and was trying late when hopelessly beaten.

Footnotes
AZZARO STEEL was unhurried while in the three path through the turn, angled into the five path for the drive, rallied from mid-rack and just got up. AKAMAI
vied for the lead from the two path through the turn, inched away inside the eighth pole, continued with the lead very late and was just nailed at the wire.
KING SOCIAL trailed into the lane while racing in the three path, gained momentum once straightened, looked for room in the four path, guided to the five or
six path and finished willingly for the show spot. COMPASS POINT vied for the early lead then settled back to chase the pace through the turn, came into
the lane from the three path and finished evenly. RICH KINGDOM chased the pace from the four path through late turn, was asked for more near the
five-sixteenths pole, came into the lane from the seven path and weakened. MAI TAI'S GEM vied for the lead into the lane then faltered through the final
eighth. SUCCESSFULLY DONE was close up early into the turn, raced in the five to the four path through the turn and tired. ALTERED was never a factor
while in the two or three path through the turn. BONNIE BILL vied for the early lead, was bumped and jostled nearing the turn, continued to chase from the
inside and faded through the lane.

early, bid six wide at the three-eighths pole, was no match in the stretch and was caught for the place. AUNT RUTH led early inside, settled, then bid three
wide on the turn and couldn't close late. SONADOR pressed the pace in the four path, bid at the three-eighths pole, had a short lead but faltered.

through the first turn, continued to chase the dueling leaders into the turn, was asked for more while in the five path, continued in the six path into the lane
and moved up for the place spot while not a threat to the top one. BEACH KITTEN set the pace while under pressure into the far turn, could not keep up

Footnotes
DRAKAINA stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole to cut the corner and was clear under mild urging. WEST COAST JUSTICE was never far back,
bid four wide at the quarter pole but was no match in the drive. PRINCESS LENNY was clear early, led between foes, then gave way in the stretch.
MAMBACITA stalked the pace in the three path, bid on the far turn and then faded in the stretch. JACK'S FINALE was not a factor. EMBROILED saved
ground, then faded. FUN KEY TOWN was not a factor.
