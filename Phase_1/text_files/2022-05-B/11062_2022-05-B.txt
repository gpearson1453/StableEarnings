Footnotes
BACKGROUND set the pace near the two path while being pressured from his outside, met resistance entering the lane and briefly ceded command,
collared foe late to gain the winners share. PIRATE'S PUNCH hopped a bit at the start, found solid footing to pressure the pacesetter from his outside,
lodged a bid nearing the lane to gain a brief lead but was collared by the winner in the late going. SPRAWL guided inside early to take the first turn in the
two path, moved out from that turn to track the leaders from the outside, made a mild run through the lane but needed more. SILVER DUST chased the
pace from the three path early while in close contact with the leaders, remained in good position to the lane but was empty when asked.

LES BON TEMPS tracked the front runners from the five path, ranged up in a bid nearing the lane, took command in the late going and prevailed under a
drive. TOWHEAD reared in the gate prior to opening, shuffled in to save ground on the turn, lodged a bid along the rail and finished second best. FUN
MONEY set a pressured pace from the two path, battled inside a foe to the lane but faded. MO BONITA broke inward to bump CHIQUITA MOSCA at the
start, quickened to press the pace from the outside, battled the leader to the lane and faltered in the drive. CHIQUITA MOSCA bumped at the start and
pushed inward, checked when angling out in the opening stages, coasted along in contact with the field but lacked the needed kick while passing tired foes.
FRANGO ELECTRICO stalked within striking distance racing in the four path then faded late. CATHERINE BLAZE was outrun.

Footnotes
LITTLE MOMBO angled in shortly after the break to be forwardly placed to the turn, matched strides with the pace setter to the top of the stretch, bested
that one nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew well clear through the lane. TWENTYTWENTY HOAX tracked the leaders while racing a bit outside and
near mid pack, offered a bid out of the turn and through the lane to secure the place. LADYBELUCKY moved to the inside for a ground saving trip,
responded to the request for a run out of the turn but lacked the needed kick. SHA GIRL was away well, then settled in good position along the rail, offered a
bid out of the turn and improved position. LAMASCO settled along the outside and raced in the four path, remained on the outside and finished evenly.
DIVINE HOPE bolted sharply outside at the break, righted to race along the outside, then weaved in the lane. MAGGIE E showed quick feet from the break
to secure the lead, raced in the front to the top of the lane then folded.

eighth pole and drew away in the final stages. DULCIMER DAME was bumped early on, stalked the pace, was in the four path into the lane, led near the
three sixteenths pole, was overtaken near the eighth pole and no match for the winner in the final stages. COPPER CHARM was bumped at the start,
chased the pace early, was in the six path into the lane and moved up in the stretch run. INVALUABLE was bumped at the start, chased the pace early,
raced in the five path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive. DESTINY'S DARLING was bumped after the start and never a factor. SUMMER

R CALLI KIM showed speed from the gate to be in front at the finish line the first time, maintained stride around the turn while being pressured from the
outside, was in good order around the second turn then met a challenge at the quarter pole, responded when asked and edged ahead of rivals. GOOD
MEASURE moved to the inside along the first turn, raced along the inside through the backstretch, remained in a ground saving position through the final
turn, offered a run through the lane and finished willingly. QUEEN BOURBON matched strides with the speed in the opening quarter, allowed to setting to
press the pace from the outside, was on even terms out of the final turn when providing a challenge to the winner but was outfinished by the top two.
DESIGNER READY moved sharply to the rail shortly after the break, saved ground the lane when offering his run and faltered. HIGH FASHION raced wide
throughout checked near the five-sixteenths pole when in traffic and finished evenly. MET IN MIAMI shifted to the inside on the first turn, moved out around
the second while chasing the field then lacked the needed respsonse. SCARABEA raced in tight company in the early going, chased from between horses
along the backstretch, was in company to the lane, tired and was eased to the wire. MALIBU MARLEE took an awkward step shortly after the start and lost
her rider.

Footnotes
SEVEN FLAT stalked the pace early on, made a three wide bid nearing the lane, took over command down the lane and drew off late under a steady drive.
SCATTERSHACK tracked the pace early on, took over and led into the lane but was no match for the winner down the lane and held place on even terms.
BIG REDWHITEBLUE raced back early on, made a four wide bid nearing the lane, was up for place late in the late stages and finished on even terms. MY
FAVORITE UNCLE stalked the pace early, was in the four path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. CALIPARI trailed the field early on, was
in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch drive. RERALLY raced along the inside, made a bid near the five sixteenths pole, stayed on
the rail into the lane and faded late in the drive. LUCKMAN dueled early on, was in the two path into the lane and tired down the lane. MY BROTHER CAM
had early speed then folded up along the turn and eased in the stretch.
