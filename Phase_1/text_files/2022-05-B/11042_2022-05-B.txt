Footnotes
CHARLIV tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, made a steady gain and edgeds up in the final
strides. WHISTLER DIXIE set the pace on the inside, shook clear through the turn, increased her margin through the lane, held sway to the final strides and
was outfinished. DOWN TO EARTH stalked the pace from between rivals, held position on the two path through the turn, angled out to bid four wide into the
stretch, made a steady gain and missed. BELLAS EYES well placed and between foes, held position on the two path through the turn, came through on that
path into the stretch and lacked the needed late kick. SHIPMANS MAGIC broke awkwardly from the gate, saved ground through the turn, angled out in the
stretch and passed tiring rivals. INTERVENTION well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and had no
rally. DOCS WAY was no factor, widest. COURTED well placed and three wide, held position through the turn, then faded in the stretch.
