Footnotes
COMMCAT rated off the pace inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, eased outward leaving the turn and dug in
to take over later yards. GOSSIPING closed to the lead nearing the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole,
was caught at the rail toward the quarter, recovered the advantage over VICTORY ROYALE mid-stretch but was no match for the winner later yards. The
latter saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep approaching the quarter,
drew clear midway on the far turn but flattened inside the sixteenth pole. HOWSAFEAREMYCOLORS settled off the pace in the three path the first turn,
gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, ran in the six path of the far turn then flattened stride widest. TAPPING SOUTH saved ground on the first
turn, raced blocked through the backstretch, bid into the far turn and ran in the three path through the turn, but showed little in the lane. C V'S CAMPFIRE
raced off the pace in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then weakened.
NAJWA rated close off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. LOVETHEONEYOUGOT had a brief
early lead then stalked into the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but gave way off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
LOVE TO ZOOM exchanged contact with WALK A FINE LINE leaving the gate then stalked two deep, gave chase from the three eighths pole, raced close
off the rail on the far turn, lugged in to make contact with Katalima at the eighth pole and repeatedly through the upper stretch, raced in tight between horses
mid-stretch but got up in later yards. WALK A FINE LINE exchanged contact with Love To Zoom leaving the gate then rated the pace inside, came under
pressure nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn, drifted a bit into the stretch, lugged in under right hand urging and made contact with
Love To Zoom mid-stretch, then outfinished through later yards. KATALIMA saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced at the
rail on the far turn, was bumped at the eighth pole and repeatedly through the upper stretch, checked from tight quarters at the rail mid-stretch and flattened
from that point. BONNIE BLUETOOTH settled off the rail the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the three eighths pole, ran in the
five path of the far turn and raced evenly in the lane. HERETODAYGONMANANA ran in the four path the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths
pole, came through the far turn in the four path then flattened stride. DYLADDIE rounded the opening turn in the three path then stalked into the
backstretch, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole but faded through the far turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the riders of
Walk A Fine Line and Love To Zoom, lodged by the rider of Katalima, and as a result, Love To Zoom was disqualified to third place for initiating contact with
Katalima in the vicinity of the eighth pole.

C R'S UNCLE LINO rated close inside, bid leaving the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, dueled to the
front approaching mid-stretch and was steadily encouraged to hold on. LATE IN THE GAME saved ground on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths
pole, entered the far turn off the rail, angled six wide through the turn, steadily closed in the lane and took second the final strides. FELICIAS CASTLE saved
early ground, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close five wide on the far turn but flattened stride later yards. REMYS GUNSMOKE rated a short
lead inside, was pressured nearing the three eighths pole, contested the advantage at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead nearing mid-stretch and
flattened the final sixteenth. WELL EQUIPPED rounded the first turn in the four path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and raced close three wide on the far
turn, though, flattened inside the eighth pole. SETTLEMENT DATE rounded the first turn about the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole, came
through the far turn four wide then flattened leaving the eighth pole. AIR MEDAL saved ground racing well back, picked up the chase from the three eighths
pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. FOURDIAMONDSPLEASE stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase from the three eighths
pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. OBANNON rounded the first turn about the five path, left the turn outside and showed little response through

Footnotes
DON'T DARE ME stalked off the rail then bid nearing the three eighths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, dug in for the nod
later yards and inched further ahead nearing the wire. STRETCH THE TRUTH stumbled at the break then accelerated to the front at the thirteen sixteenths
pole and angled to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, was met
mid-stretch and grudgingly ceded later yards. ROOF TOP BAR raced well off the early pace about the three path, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, ran at
the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for third. POSTINO'S STORY settled off the pace about the three path, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, ran off the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR saved ground, picked up the
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened in the lane. JUST NOD AND SMILE saved early ground, eased
outward into the backstretch and showed little response. GOOFY BOY saved ground. SUSPIROS came through the opening turn about the four path,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn.
