Footnotes
NAVAL AVIATOR broke a step slowly at the start and trailed along the inside around the first turn, moved out of last entering the backstretch before shifting
outwardly, cut the gap on the leading pair under light encouragement, pursued the clear leader three wide around the far turn, engaged that rival in upper
stretch, grinded away to vie in midstretch, forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole, and edged away. CARMICHAEL set a clear pace in the two path, met
NAVAL AVIATOR's challenge in upper stretch, resisted that foe grudgingly through midstretch, but was bested a sixteenth from home. NOTABLE
EXCEPTION laid off of the pace in the three path, trailed down the backstretch, then took the two path around the far turn before surpassing a tiring foe in
the final furlong. LEMONADEATTHELATCH stalked along the inside, chased the clear leader from the two path while an outer rival ranged up, and faded
through the lane.

Footnotes
ALTERED SHOT pressed two wide, vied around the turn, led entering the lane, and kicked away in upper stretch. SWEET CONFUSION broke half a step
slowly while bumping with an inner rival at the start, tracked the pace three wide, moved early to press the leading pair at the nine sixteenths pole, but failed
to keep pace approaching the three furlong marker, chased them around the turn, kept on to bid for place at the furlong grounds, dueled for that position
through the late stages, and prevailed. RUNNIN HAPPY set the pace along the inside, clung to an advantage from a vying outer rival around the turn, got
headed at the quarter pole, failed to keep pace in upper stretch, met SWEET CONFUSION's challenge for place leaving the furlong grounds, battled bravely
for that position thereafter, but succumbed late. FABRICATE broke a beat slowly and bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked two wide, chased while
failing to progress under strong urging in the foru path around the turn, and lacked a response through the lane while making little impact. DALLAS
VOLUNTEER stalked along the inside, but required encouragement to keep pace around the turn, and faded through the lane. MOHAYLADY lagged well
behind around the turn, and cut the gap on the rest of the field through the lane.

MEGACITY came in and bumped STREET READY at the start, went forward and established a clear advantage early on, managed his loose lead down the
backstretch, met PERFECT SPEIGHTY's bid entering the lane, gamely dueled with that foe through midstretch, tenaciously repelled that rival entering the
final sixteenth, and just held from an outer surging rival late. MIDNIGHT TEA TIME stalked along the inside, shifted outside of the top pair in upper stretch,
grinded away through midstretch while mildly progressing, but sustained a good late kick, surged approaching the wire, but missed via a tight photo finish.
PERFECT SPEIGHTY stalked outside of the loose leader, pressed that foe around the far turn, bid entering the lane, sparred through upper stretch, but was
turned away a sixteenth from home, and got outkicked for place late. STREET READY bobbled while breaking a beat slowly before being bumped and
bothered by an outer rival soon after, trailed the field in the two path around both turns, and moved up between horses in the final furlong. WHISKEY
DOUBLE settled off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. PINE KNOLL settled off of the pace along the
inside, lost action passing the three quarter pole when appearing to brush the inner railing, then saved ground, but had little to offer.

PLAYED HARD stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, pressed that foe down the backstretch, bid at the five sixteenths pole, assumed
command in upper stretch, and drew off. SALUTE THE FLAG settled at the rear in the three to four path around the first turn, gained to track the main
contingent approaching the far turn, chased the top pair under urging around that bend, inched closer turning for home, then stayed on while chasing the
clearing leader through the lane. SUNNY ISLE BEACH tracked from midpack two wide, and stayed on. CASA DE GOAT set a clear pace in the three to two
path around the first turn, encountered a stern challenge from the eventual winner around the far turn, proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and
weakened. H. T. XENA was outrun. PARK ON THE NILE lost balance momentarily when the gates opened, tracked along the inside, but faded turning for
home, got eased in midstretch, was pulled up at the wire, then walked off.

Footnotes
BOMBDIGGITY set the pace along the inside, set fast fractions while hounded by a trio of outer rivals around the turn, shook free of them passing the
quarter pole, drew clear in upper stretch, held sway from a rallying HAZY COMMAND through midstretch, met that foe's bid in the late stages, and held firm.
HAZY COMMAND laid off of of the pace, tracked the quartet of leaders two wide around the turn, shifted outside of them entering the lane, rallied to take
aim on a clear BOMBDIGGITY in the final furlong, sustained his charge to attempt a late bid, but was kept at bay. WINGS OF AN ANGEL moved forward
approaching the turn to stalk three wide and between horses, vied among foes leaving the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with her innermost
counterpart at the quarter pole, chased on her left lead, lost place entering the final sixteenth, and held show. PATHETIQUE tracked four wide, moved early
to prompt the pace at the three furlong pole, but failed to keep pace with inner foes at the quarter pole, and tired. ROOKERY trailed, swung six wide entering
the lane, and stayed on while shifting ground inwardly. MINER'S QUEEN prompted the pace two wide, vied among foes around the turn, but weakened
approaching the lane. FRACING NASTY laid close up along the inside early on, took back to stalk after a furlong and a half, but faded into the turn, and was
done early.

Footnotes
HONORABLY tracked two wide and between horses, stalked behind the leading trio entering the lane, split those foes three wide in upper stretch to gain an
advantage at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. HEY THERE was forced outwardly a bit at the start, tracked from midpack four wide, shifted five wide in
upper stretch, stayed on well, and flopped back to his left lead in the final sixteenth while securing place. WINGS LIKE EAGLES hesitated at the start before
breaking outwardly, raced far back while remaining in the six path around the turn, fanned seven wide in upper stretch, and produced a good late kick
outside of foes in the final furlong to reach show at the wire. BROADWAY BLAZE set the pace in the three to two path, then from between horses turning for
home, gamely sustained vying position through upper stretch, but was outkicked at the furlong pole, and gave way on her left lead. MOST EMPRESSIVE
settled off of the pace five wide, shifted six wide entering the lane, and only produced a mild kick. BEAUTIFUL FAREWELL tracked along the inside while
tugging in the bit early on, stalked around the turn, chased in the two path approaching midstretch, but lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. LEAVE IT
BE broke slowly, saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MUSICAL DESIGN came out a bit at the start, raced close up two wide and among foes
approaching the turn, bid for the lead inside of the leading tapir at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane but flattened out at the furlong grounds,
and faded. MS MERRABEL pressed between horses early on, but faltered three wide and between horses into the turn. JALEBI BABY pressed three wide,
but tired four wide in upper stretch. AIR OF AUTHORITY broke slowly, laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, and tired. STAGE QUEEN
spotted the leaders a few lengths out of the gate, lagged behind the field around the turn, greenly refused to change leads in upper stretch, and was outrun.

RUNNIN' RAY set the pace from the outset, was in the two path into the lane, under a long drive down the lane and prevailed in the final stages. THE STIFF
raced from between horses along the first turn and stayed there to press the pace, raced in the three path into the lane, was under a long drive down the
lane and outfinished in the final stages. LORD DRAGON raced in the two path along the first turn, chased the pace early, was in the four path into the lane,
made a bid in the stretch but had no late gain in the final stages. MY BARILEY raced three wide along the first turn, tracked the early pace, was in the six
path into the lane and weakened late in the stretch run. BALLINONABUDJET raced on the inside along the first turn and was back early on, was in the two
path into the lane and moved up. MY BETS was never a threat. ZANESVILLE was done early.

Footnotes
CELLIST raced back early on, made a bid three wide nearing the lane, was in the four path into the lane, inched clear near the sixteenths pole and held off
rival in the final stages. REIGNING SPIRIT was unhurried early on, raced in the five path into the lane, rallied down the lane, had a late kick but did not have
enough in the final stages. HIGHEST HONORS stumbled at the start and settled back early on, was in the six path into the lane, rallied down the lane and
was up for show at the wire. CIBOLIAN chased the pace early on, was shuffled back along the final turn, raced in the three path into the lane and came
again late in the stretch run. BAMA BREEZE was reserved early on, fanned into the seven path entering the lane with a belated gain in the stretch drive.
SHAMROCKET raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and moved up late in the stretch run. CAMP HOPE chased the pace early, made a
bid from between horses nearing the lane, was in the three path into the lane, bumped down the lane and weakened late in the stretch. MODUS OPERANDI
(IRE) was pocketed early on, raced in the four path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but weakened late in the drive. CAVALRY CHARGE set the
pace early, raced in the two path into the lane, was overtaken near the eighth pole, bumped and faltered late in the drive. ANOTHER MYSTERY was never
a threat. BLANKET OF ROSES was never a factor. STRONG TIDE tracked the pace early, was in the two path into the lane, put in tight along the rail down
the lane and was checked. CULLUM ROAD stalked the pace early, was in the three path into the lane and faded late in the stretch drive.
AJOURNEYTOFREEDOM was on the inside and through after a half.
