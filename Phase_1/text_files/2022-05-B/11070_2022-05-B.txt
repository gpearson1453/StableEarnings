Footnotes
CUPID'S STRIKE set the pace along the inner rail, was kept to his business in the stretch and eagerly pulled away. VODKATINI stalked the pace outside
horses, was three wide on both turns and gained the place. MELIPONINI BEE showed speed, was lightly steadied off foes around the first turn, dropped
back on the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, raced between horses late and passed tired ones. CUSH EFFECT , three wide the first turn, raced in
the two path on the far turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and passed tired horses. OSA , bumped by BELLA BETTINA leaving the starting gate,
raced along the inner rail most of the trip and failed to rally. FREEZE THE DAY , outside the winner, chased that one to the stretch and weakened the final
furlong. BELLA BETTINA came in at the break, chased the pace near the inner rail and gave way the final furlong. RATIONALMILLENNIAL , steadied
entering the first turn, was four wide on the turns and retreated. ALITTLESLICEOF PIE faltered.

Footnotes
GHOST STALKER took a short lead into the first turn then spurted clear to set a soft pace, took pressure from two rivals to his outside leaving the five
eighths, dueled foes from the far turn to mid stretch, wandered outward under strong handling, briefly shook back clear with a sixteenth remaining then dug
in tenaciously to fend off MY GOOD MAN. MY GOOD MAN settled off the inside while within range, chased the dueling trio leaving the three eighths while
about three wide, angled five wide into the lane, made a grinding run outside foes, joined the winner in deep stretch but was kept at bay. BAHAMA
CHANNEL , between runners into the first turn, angled out and moved up past the five eighths, bid three deep soon after, disputed the issue past mid
stretch, was floated out a bit and hung late. ONE TWO KID prompted the pace outside the winner, bid between foes past the five eighths, dueled past mid
stretch and faded. PERCHER , four wide, lacked a serious bid. MAMAIGOTTHIS saved ground and faded.

Footnotes
VINEGAR VEGGIES saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, bumped with POINT WELL TAKEN when eased off the rail approaching the eighth
pole, closed determinedly outside VIVI MY LOVE, gained the lead late and drove clear. VIVI MY LOVE , showing improved speed, quickly opened a clear
lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened late. POINT WELL TAKEN , well placed in the two path around the turn, bumped with the winner in mid
stretch and failed to menace in an even effort. MORETHANASTORM broke slowly and was outrun. SPOTAKE was outrun. PERFECT MOVE , off slowly,
hugged the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MY SUPER SALLY settled off of a contested pace while off the inside, angled out mid turn while put to some pressure, straightened away to be about four
wide into the lane, shifted out a bit wider past the three sixteenths, closed steadily under left handed asking, drew alongside MOON BIZ in deep stretch and
got the bob. MOON BIZ disputed the pace outside SOME IS NINE then was joined from the outside by DAUNTLESS GAL entering the turn, battled inside
SOME IS NINE past the five sixteenths to upper stretch, shook clear under left handed rousing in mid stretch, kept on gamely but lost the bob. SOME IS
NINE , away in good order, disputed the pace towards the rail, was under urging to keep pace past mid turn, saw the leader go clear with an eighth to go but
stayed on well from there. FLAVA'S DREAM saved ground while not far off the embattled leaders, moved up under coaxing into the lane, eased out for the
final furlong and kept on willingly to bridge the gap. SPECIAL FREEDOM was squeezed back soon after the break, raced off the pace and outside a rival,
altered in for the final furlong but lacked a solid finish. DAUNTLESS GAL , off slowly, rushed up soon after, bid three deep into the turn, failed to kick on with
the leaders leaving the five sixteenths, gave hard chase into the lane but came up empty. PASS IT ON lagged off the pace, saved ground into the lane,
remained inside but failed to generate a solid finish.

Footnotes
SWAYIN TO AND FRO disputed the early pace outside LOST ANCHOR, disposed of that one leaving the turn, remained on her left lead through the
stretch, was under brisk urging in mid stretch and eagerly pulled away. LOOKIN SPUNKY was not an early factor, hugged the inner rail on the turn, eased
out to the two path approaching the stretch and rallied. DOOMSCROLLER lacked speed, swung to the four path leaving the turn, raced outside horses and
passed tired ones. HARPER'S DO was well placed early and weakened. LOST ANCHOR showed speed along the inner rail and weakened. BARB THE
BOSS , fractious on the track while being saddled, was no factor. TOUSSAUD'S RANSOM , outrun, hugged the inner rail on the turn. KOBE'S GIRL , three
wide chasing the pace around the turn, gave way. IMINCHARGENOW , a bit rank early, was outrun.

Footnotes
GOLDEN CAN cruised clear early, dictated the pace towards the rail, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. MAGICAL
LUNA had speed then dropped down towards the rail to stalk the winner, was under pressure pursuing into the lane and kept on well while saving the place.
WHITEKNUCKLEFLYER , off slowly, was urged off the rail, came four wide for the drive and rallied between foes. BANDITS WARRIOR stalked outside a
rival, shifted out some in the drive and kept on with effort between runners. GRAND SKYLARK stalked off the rail, moved out a bit mid turn and edged up
three deep, was guided further out in the course past mid stretch and churned on. MOONSAFE saved ground in mid pack, edged up towards the rail leaving
mid stretch then lacked some room nearing the wire. PEACE OUT , off the pace, swung wide and had a belated kick. FOOL YOURSELF , sluggish while
under asking from the gate, came four wide for the drive but lacked a bid. SICK PACK SARA steadied off a rival leaving the half mile marker, saved ground
and faded around the turn.

Footnotes
SKY OF GOLD exchanged contact with FRIGHTLAND soon after the break, sped clear and set a rated pace towards the inner rail, drifted two wide into the
lane then back in towards the rail in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive leaving mid stretch, drifted out some late while under left handed asking and
prevailed. LUV YA BYE BYE drifted in slightly soon after the start, was corrected and prompted the pace two wide, shifted three wide into the lane, gave
hard chase past the furlong grounds, continued on gamely and slowly bridged the gap. FRIGHTLAND bumped with SKY OF GOLD a few strides from the
gate, stumbled when put in tight soon after, regrouped and advanced towards the rail heading the half mile marker, pursued the top pair while saving ground
into the lane, eased out a bit then steadied when lacking room in the final fifty yards. LATE NIGHT LARRY drifted in soon after the break and crowded
FRIGHTLAND, straightened and dropped off the pace while saving some ground, angled four wide into the lane but lacked a solid finish. TAKE CHARGE
TOO , off slow when hitting the outer part of the stall, regrouped and moved up four wide heading past the five eighths, gave wide chase around the turn,
failed to kick on near mid stretch and faded. RIXEY ROCKET gave early chase three wide, shifted in around the turn and retreated. Following an objection
by the rider of FRIGHTLAND against LUV YA BYE BYE for interference soon after the start, LUV YA BYE BYE was disqualified from second and placed
third. PER RULING FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, THE DISQUALIFICATION WAS OVERTURNED FOR LUV YA BYE BYE.
