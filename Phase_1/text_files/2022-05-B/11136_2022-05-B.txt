SILK STILETTOS broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from the inside of C R SUNRISE in the
run down the backstretch and into the final turn, assumed a clear advantage midway through the turn, and was never seriously threatened late. ONE FLEET
PRINCESS settled off the contested early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, commenced her bid three wide entering the final
turn, and closed willingly three out from the rail in the drive to get up for the place in the final strides. C R SUNRISE away alertly and dueled for the lead one
out from the rail entering the first turn, forced the issue two wide from the outside of SILK STILETTOS in the run down the backside and into the final turn,
struggled to keep tabs on that rival midway through the turn, and closed three wide in the drive and just failed to hold the place. PAGODA RIDGE stalked
the dueling leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the final turn, but was outfinished over the
final furlong. ALWAYS IN CHARGE trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to
respond with the needed closing response when called upon.

one out from the rail, commenced his bid two wide entering the final turn, was no match for the winner, but battled gamely from along the rail in the drive to

BETTIN' MAN away alertly and rushed to the lead three out from the rail entering the first turn, dictated the pace one out from the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied two wide into the final turn, was collared by NORTHERN KID entering the lane, but battled back to repel that bid while finishing four wide
in deep stretch to prevail. NORTHERN KID away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the
inside entering the final turn, slipped through at the rail entering the lane to take a brief advantage, but was unable to fend off a determined pacesetter who
battled back in deep stretch to get up in time. JACK DON'T DRINK broke sharply and was allowed to settle off the early pace while saving ground at the rail,
rallied smartly from along the inside entering the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to get up for a share. ZULU POWER was off a
step slow and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest four
wide in the stretch drive. DONEGAL BOY tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, continued to chase the pacesetter three
wide entering the final turn, but faded in the drive. ONE TOONUMAANY was chased three wide into the first turn to gain a stalking trip entering the

PINEAPPLE TIDBITS unhurried early while dropping back to trail, commenced her bid three wide from the back of the pack approaching the final turn, and
continued on steadily three wide in the lane to get up in the final strides. RACINO tracked the leader three out from the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced her bid three wide entering the final turn, angled to the rail entering the lane, and closed willingly from the rail late to just miss. HEART OF
TEXAS away well and tracked the leaders into the first turn while racing two out from the rail, forced the issue three wide in the run down the backstretch,
assumed command entering the final turn, maintained a clear advantage into the lane, but was unable to hold. GIFTED GREY settled off the early pace
while racing two wide into the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, and finished with interest two out from the rail in the drive. COUNTESS
CAT broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out from the rail entering the first turn, battled for the lead from between rivals in the runto the final turn, was
unable to match strides with HEART OF TEXAS entering the final turn, and had little to offer late. TIMELESS SHRUG settled off the contested early pace
while saving ground at the rail entering the backside, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious impact. BAKFIRE BABY
away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside in the run down the backstretch, was
unable to match strides with her pace rivals entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong. HEREVERYWISH lagged well back early while
saving ground at the rail entering the backstretch, raced wide through the final turn, and was never a factor.

WE B THREE away well and tracked the leader through the first turn while racing one out from the rail, forced the issue two wide from the outside of
ANOTHERSUNNYDAY in the run down the backstretch, assumed command while racing two wide into the final turn, maintained her lead into the lane,
drifted out slightly under left handed urging, impeding KICK UP THE DUST in mid stretch, and repelled a late bid by RUN LOLA RUN to prevail. RUN LOLA
RUN settled well off the contested early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, launched her bid three wide entering the final turn,
and closed determinedly four wide in the drive to just miss. KICK UP THE DUST stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail,
rallied smartly two wide through the final turn, and continued one willingly into the lane, but steadied sharply when put in tight quarters in mid stretch, and
was unable to get back into stride. ARTISTIC JEWLER unhurried early while dropping back to trail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and found her best
stride late while finishing four wide in deep stretch. ANOTHERSUNNYDAY away alertly and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a
pressured pace from along the rail in the run to the final turn, was overtaken entering the turn, and was outfinished in the late going. BOUNDFORJAMAICA
broke sharply and stalked the leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, but began to weaken entering the final turn, and
had nothing to offer late. Following the running of this race there was both a stewards inquiry as well as a jockey's claim of foul. The rider of KICK UP THE
DUST lodged claims of foul against the rider's of both WE B THREE and RUN LOLA RUN, for alleged interference in mid stretch. After review, one of the
claims of foul was upheld. WE BE THREE was disqualified from first and placed third for causing interference to KICK UP THE DUST

OMBRE' ROSE broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace in the run down the backstretch and into
the final turn, and battled gamely one out from the rail in the drive to prevail. TAKE CHARGE GWEN settled well off the early leaders while racing two out
from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly four wide entering the final turn, and closed determinedly three out from the rail in the drive to just miss.
GEM OF INCEPTION pressed the leader one out from the rail entering the backside, continued to force the issue two wide from the outside of OMBRE'
ROSE through the final turn, and finished willingly three wide in the drive, while drifting in under right handed urging, and impeding HARLEN'S ANGEL
nearing the wire. ANIMA away alertly and tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn,
and finished evenly from just off the rail in the drive. HARLAN'S ANGEL tracked the leaders two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied two
wide through the final turn while awaiting room, and finished one out from the rail in the stretch drive before steadying sharply when put in tight quarters late.
ZETAMARIE settled off the early pace while saving ground along the inside entering the backstretch, commenced her bid from just off the rail entering the
final turn, and finished from along the inside in the drive while unable to make a serious late impact. FOURTOWIN away well and was allowed to settle off
the contested early pace while racing four wide into the backstretch, rallied five wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response over the final
furlong. SIMPLY GOLDEN unhurried early while dropping back to trail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.
