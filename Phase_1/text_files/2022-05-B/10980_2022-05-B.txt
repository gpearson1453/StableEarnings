ZIBBY TOO moved up inside the leaders to challenge in early backstretch, continued inside JUDGE ON THE RUN through the final and edged clear then
drew off under steady urging in the lane. JUDGE ON THE RUN was on the early pace outside P R ODDS SETTER, continued with the winner to duel
through the far turn then could not go with that one in the lane. JOY FOREVER settled four wide early, moved in going to the final turn but could not close
the gap on the top pair. INEWAGALLIKETHAT was not a threat. P R ODDS SETTER moved to the early lead off the inside about the two or three path,
dropped back going to the final turn and was eased under the wire.

MIDNIGHT DRAMA dueled on the lead inside WOKE UP WILD while about the two or three path, held well in the lane and narrowly edged that rival late.
WOKE UP WILD dueled outside the winner throughout and narrowly missed. CRIMSON TRACE tracked the leaders three wide and could not produce the
needed late effort. RADICATOR was just off the leaders arly three to four wide and lacked a closing run. BUD MINISTER saved ground and had no rally.
DRYSPELL hesitated then lunged at the break to get away last and failed to threaten outside.

rally. GOLD NOTE moved up three wide but could not threaten the top pair. MASTERPIECE DAY tracked the early leader three wide and weakened in the
far turn. GOOSE DRANK WINE was just off the early pace three to four wide and weakened. CHERUBIM dropped back before going a half and gave way

that one through the far turn and saved the place late while caught by the winner. COWBOY DON stalked the pace three or four wide, rallied and just
missed the place. HOLIDAY JOKE was with the pace four wide, continued outside ONE SON OF A CHIEF to duel through the far turn into the lane but was
outfinished for position late. FAYETTE WARRIOR was on the early lead inside and tire3d. THEGREATGENERATION showed speed two or three wide

HEAVENS PRINCESS moved up inside FLYER'S SHADOW to gain the lead going to the far turn, drew off in the turn and held the margin under steady
handling. SWEET CAPRI saved ground in reach of the pace, angled out into the lane and rallied to gain the place late. COUVERTURE stalked the pace four
wide to get nearest the winner into the far turn but had no late rally. FLYER'S SHADOW was on the early lead three wide and weakened. TEA AT NOON
failed to rally three wide. AMBER WAVES was always back. HOLIDAY CHIMES appeared to take one lunge and then propped at the break and unseated
the rider, crashed through the inside rail before going a furlong and was injured and vanned off. An inquiry was posted into the start and found that the horse
caused its own trouble.

LIGHT BOUND BID was along the inside stalking the leaders, angled three wide nearing the lane to bid into the stretch and went well but was caught to
finish on even terms with WAR EAGLE'S RETURN. WAR EAGLE'S RETURN settled four wide in reach of the pace, rallied in the lane and was up for finish
on even terms with LIGHT BOUND BID. ROCKETRINGO showed the most early speed to gain inside position, made the pace to late in the far turn and
came up empty once headed. HYPER DRIVE was along the inside, steadied in midstretch and lost position. GREEN CARD was just off the early pace three
or four wide and weakened. WEST COAST BROKER followed the pace two or three wide and weakened. PICKELJUICE was always back.

HIGH COST OF LIVIN gained a short lead racing out from the rail, made all the running and held safe through the lane. SWEET TATUM moved up two and
three wide to bid outside the winner in the far turn but could not run that one down. GOODNIGHTLOVING leaned into the side of the gate, moved up two
and three wide on the far turn, angled four wide into the lane and made a mild rally. DONNAS FINAL WORD lunged at the break, moved up two and three
wide but could not threaten late. INAGOODWAY was along the inside and lacked a final closing run. SHIVERHERTIMBERS followed the early pace three or
four wide and weakened. SUCH GREAT HEIGHTS followed the pace four wide and tired.
