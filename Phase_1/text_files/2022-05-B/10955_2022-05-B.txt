Footnotes
DOWNTOWN BROWN moved up three wide to bid through the far turn and move clear then held safe late as BULL RING closed. BULL RING saved
ground back off the early, moved up going to the far turn, angled three wide into the lane and closed but could not reel in the winner. R VOO'S TABOO
saved ground in reach of the pace, angled four wide into the lane gained clear for the show but could not threaten the top pair. PACIFIC HARBOR was on
the pace three wide to the far turn and weakened nearing the lane. PERVASIVE broke in the air to get away last, moved up outside but could not threaten.
DEACON BEACON showed early speed inside PACIFIC HABOR and tired in the far turn. JERRY TIME showed some early foot three or four wide but gave
way before the far turn and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
PHLASH DRIVE tracked the early leader three wide, moved to challenge going up the backstretch then came in a bit and bumped with rivals going to the
final turn, gained the lead turning for home and held safe to the wire. YAYASGOTMOREGAME stalked the pace three wide never far back, moved to
challenge between rivals going to the final turn and bumped and took up from tight quarters, continued to challenge through the lane but could not run down
the winner. KENHEDOIT was on the pace along the inside, came out a bit in late backstretch as the top three bumped, continued to vie into the lane but
was outfinished in the drive. BARTENDERS MISTAKE failed to mount a rally three and four wide. L B GOLD followed the pace three wide and weakened. P
R WHY NOT saved ground and failed to threaten. REPORT TO DUTY was not a factor. YE BE JUDGED stalked the early pace along the inside and tired.
CHARED was not a factor four wide. The trainer of YAYASGOTMOREGAME lodged a claim of foul alleging interference into the far turn which was not
allowed.
