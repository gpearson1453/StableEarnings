ADITYA tracked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, pulled himself to the leaders in the run to the final turn, battled for the
lead through the turn from the outside of KHAIKY'S COMMAND, and wore down that stubborn rival late to prevail. KHAIKY'S COMMAND away alertly and
raced to a narrow advantage from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch and through
the final turn, and battled gamely through the lane to just miss. BILLS SMOKN BULLET broke sharply and pressed the pace one out from the rail entering
the first turn, continued to force the issue two wide in the run down the backside, struggled to keep pace with the to pair from between rivals entering the
final turn, but finished determinedly two wide in the drive to garner a share. VON DOM away well and tracked the leaders from between rivals entering the
backstretch, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but lacked the closing response needed when called upon. RING OF KERRY tracked the leaders from
along the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied along the inside entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response over the final furlong to
be a factor. The three quarter split for this race was unavailable at this time

KNOPFLER away well and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the inside of
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR in the run down the backstretch, continued to save ground through the final turn, opened a clear advantage leaving the turn,
and was never seriously threatened late. CALAMAZEUS broke sharply and stalked the dueling leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch,
commenced his bid smartly two out from the rail entering the final turn, and closed determinedly two wide in the drive to get up for the place. DEBATABLE
unhurried early while dropping back to trail entering the first turn, bided his time at the back of the pack in the run down the backside, rallied from along the
rail entering the final turn, and closed with late interest from just off the rail in the drive to get up for a share. JACOBS CALL settled off the contested early
pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, took up the chase two wide entering the final turn, but was unable to make a late impact.
FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR away alertly and dueled for the lead from the outside of KNOPFLER entering the first turn, forced the issue from the outside of
that rival in the run down the backstretch, struggled to keep tabs on that foe entering the final turn, and weakened over the final furlong.

REA MEA away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn to battle for the
lead, assumed command in mid stretch and quickly drew clear. FLORAL stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied
smartly three wide entering the final turn to force the issue, and closed determinedly three wide in the drive to get up for the place in the final stride.
DEFINITE PLEASURE away alertly and raced to the lead from just off the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backside,
battled through the final turn from the inside of REA MEA, was unable to match strides with that rival in mid stretch, drifted out slightly as the winner shifted
in under left handed urging and steadied briefly, was no match for the winner late, and just failed to hold the place. MI REYNA broke sharply and was
allowed to settle off the early pace while racing three wide entering the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail entering the final turn, but lacked the needed
closing response when called upon. BAKZONE unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced four wide in the run down the backside, angled in to save
ground entering the final turn, but failed to make an impact. Following the running of this race there was both a steward's inquiry as well as a jockey's claim
of foul into an incident in mid stretch. The rider of DEFINITE PLEASURE lodged a claim of foul against the rider of REA MEA. After review the claim of foul
was disallowed, and no change was made to the original order of finish

QUEEN OF ATTITUDE was slow into stride and trailed in the run to the first turn, saved ground through the turn to race into a stalking trip entering the
backstretch, pulled her way into a tracking position before launching her bid two wide entering the final turn, collared the pacesetter soon after entering the
lane and quickly went by to prove best. OSTRACIZE settled off the early pace while racing just out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied smartly from
along the rail entering the final turn, and finished three out from the rail in the drive to prove second best. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS stalked the pacesetter
into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, commenced her bid four wide entering the final turn, and finished with late interest five wide in the
drive to get up for a share. JERSEY LILLIE away alertly and raced to the lead entering the first turn while dropping to the rail, dictated the pace in the run
down the backstretch and into the final turn, was quickly overtaken shortly after straightening for home, and faded in the late going. PRETTY ARIA broke
sharply and tracked the pacesetter one out from the rail in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final turn, began to lose position
midway through the turn, and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
SOARINGFORTHESUN broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch
and through the final turn, maintained his advantage into the lane, and widened that margin late while under confident handling. MOUNT ASGARD tracked
the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and closed two wide in the drive to hold the place.
REGAL RIOT away alertly, but was quickly taken in hand and allowed to settle into a stalking trip two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied
smartly from along the rail through the final turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, and closed willingly to just miss the place. VANCOUVER'S HUNTER
away well and stalked the leaders from along the rail entering the backstretch, commenced his bid from along the inside entering the final turn, and finished
evenly from along the rail in the drive. ITSMYDAY was pinched soon after the start, and settled well off the early pacesetters while racing three wide
entering the backstretch, rallied four wide through the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. WISELY PLAYED was pinched soon after the start and
trailed the field into the backstretch while racing three out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid when called
upon.

U DID IT broke sharply and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and through the
final turn, and was never seriously threatened while finishing out from the rail in the drive. SHAMRA tracked the leader in the run down the backstretch while
saving ground at the rail, commenced her bid two wide entering the final turn, and closed one out from the rail to finish on even terms with MARYS TAPPIN
SHOES. MARYS TAPPIN SHOES stalked the leader in the run down the backside while racing one out from the rail, rallied smartly from along the inside
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly from along the rail in the drive to finish on even terms with SHAMRA. AMANDA stalked the leader into the
backstretch while racing three out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, rallied four wide entering the final turn, but failed to mount a late bid while
finishing five wide in the drive. CATTITUDE was slow into stride and trailed the field into the backstretch while racing extremely wide, continued with a wide
trip throughout, but improved her position over the final furlong without threatening. ROSE OF TEXAS away alertly and tracked the pacesetter into the
backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide into the final turn, but faded over the final furlong. GROOVY GIRL away well and stalked the
leader into the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, raced two wide into the final turn, but weakened over the final furlong.

Footnotes
SOLANDER was unhurried early while dropping back to trail into the backstretch, was always well back and failed to make his presence felt. HE'S A SAINT
away alertly and vied for the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from just off the rail entering the backstretch, was overtaken
approaching the final turn, and was outfinished over the final furlong while racing two out from the rail. DON W broke sharply and dueled for the lead one out
from the rail entering the backstretch, forced the issue from the outside of HE'S A SAINT in the run down the backside, rallied three wide entering the final
turn, and closed willingly four wide in the drive to prove second best. UNBROKEN hopped at the start to get away poorly, settled well off the early pace
while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but failed to make a late impact when called upon. ALL
LIQUORD UP steadied briefly when put in tight quarters at the rail approaching the first turn, but gained a stalking trip one out from the rail entering the
backstretch, commenced his bid from just off the rail entering the final turn, and finished two wide in the drive to garner a share. CHASE THE SUN tracked
the leaders into the backstretch while racing just out from the rail, took advantage of an opening along the inside and slipped through to assume command
in the run to the final turn held a clear advantage into lane, and widened his margin late under confident handling. GREYTOGO away well and tracked the
leaders into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied two wide entering the final turn, and finished from along the rail in the drive.
