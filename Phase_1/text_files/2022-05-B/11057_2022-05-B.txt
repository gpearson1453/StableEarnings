Footnotes
FOREST CHATTER dueled with the runner up along the rail into the stretch, shook clear before the furlong marker, drifted out to the six path and prevailed
under right handed urging. MONTAUK COVE battled with the winner two wide, dropped back a bit in upper stretch then came on again late in the seven
path while clear for second. QUALIFLY with the second flight along the inside, went evenly. LAST DROP OF WINE trailed three wide into the stretch and
closed a gap late in the seven path. SIGNS OF GREATNESS had speed through the turn then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
CHANNEL FURY chased a fast pace two wide into the stretch, inherited the lead and drew off under mild right handed urging. CHURCHILLED with the
second flight three wide, had a mild late rally and finished clear for second in the four path. BREEZY MONEY with the second flight between horses,
improved position late in the six path. BAD LITTLE BEAST allowed to settle, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. TIME TO SHOOT saved ground and
lacked the needed kick.. LADY'S BOY sped to a clear lead soon after the start, set a fast pace to the top of the stretch then tired. GOOD IDEA was no
factor. ZALINSKY broke slowly, veered in at the start and trailed throughout. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
BLACK BUTTE away alertly, dueled for the lead two wide the entire trip and proved best under right handed urging. DREAM FEVER stalked the pace three
wide and got up for second in the four path. LILAC LACE never far back, swung wide and closed a gap late mid track. TRUEAMERICANBEAUTY broke in
front, battled with the winner along the inside until deep stretch then was outfinished. WHOVILLE stalked the pace and finished evenly in the five path.
BLACK KETTLE failed to menace. KITTY EXPRESS was no threat. OPULENT WAYS with the second flight along the rail, gave way in the stretch. BIG
BLUE EMU showed little. BESTOW was always outrun.
