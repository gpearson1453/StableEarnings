Footnotes
TOTAL MALICE broke on top, cleared from the two path to the rail early in the first turn, rated when showing the way up the backstretch, shrugged off the
runner up turning for home and had plenty left to expand her advantage through the lane under a firm right handed crop. DA DUE RUN RUN away in good
order with the winner, fell back off that one soon after, moved out to the two path, pursued that rival up the backstretch, moved a bit closer in the second
turn, proved no match through the stretch, clearly second best. MALARTACH last to leave, was four wide into the first turn in trailing, continued to see them
all the middle half, rallied mildly three wide into the stretch, no threat to the top two, just up for the show, vanned off after pulling up. SMART PEGASUS
chased the top two along the inside, had little for that pair in the drive, nipped at the wire for the show spot. PRETTY PRODUCTION in the second flight
while racing in the two path, had little for the stretch run. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

RATHER PRECOCIOUS stalked the leaders while racing three wide, advanced on that pair and challenged on the outside turning for home, vied past the
furlong marker, edged clear late under steady handling. MONZZA away well, dueled up front in the two path, narrowly showed the way into and through the
turn, continued to hold a slight advantage past the furlong marker then gave ground grudgingly to the winner. MOVE IT broke on top, dueled up front inside
the runner up along the inside, gradually weakened, not enough for the show late. FELLER settled off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the
turn, lacked a significant closing response. HOMELAND MESSA fell back to trail after the start and saved ground to no avail. HOLY SUNRISE off a step
slow, failed to menace while racing off the inside. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL TIME WAS HAND TIMED.

STELLA'S SURPRISE pressed the issue up the backstretch while well wide, four path early turn when moving to take over, showed the way until headed
entering the stretch, battled back from between rivals, brushed with the runner up late, outkicked that one prevail in determined fashion. D'WILD
BARONESS within striking distance while four wide backstretch, continued in the four path when advancing turn, put a head in front exiting the bend,
continued to hold a narrow advantage past the furlong marker, brushed with the winner a sixteenth out then was outkicked by that late. TOTALLY GRACE
broke alertly, showed the way early, remained prominent after relinquishing the advantage to the top two late in the turn, weakened in the late going while
well clear of the others. ENVOYS LEGACY broke back, trailed for three furlongs, roused in the three path out of the turn, showed some mild belated interest
to improve a bit, not a threat to the top three. ACHANCETOWIN with the first flight while three wide and between foes, shuffled back when in a bit tight
entering the turn, four wide into the stretch, had little left for the run to the wire. AMERICAN REBEL vied up front while in the two path and between foes,
gave way after a quarter. FOLLOIWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF D'WILD BARONESS AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. FRACTIONAL SPLITS AND FINAL TIME WERE HAND TIMED.

EASY TO MISS dropped inside when showing the way into the first turn, set or forced the pace closest to the rail the middle half, extended stretch duel, dug
in late to narrowly prevail. UNCLE FRANK in tight when in traffic toward the inside and the front first turn, remained forward, advanced to lodge a bid
between rivals just before a half, headed in turn by the winner late in the second turn, long, heated duel to the wire, outkicked in the late going while well
clear of the others. GETCHA forwardly placed four wide into the first turn, continued to contest the issue up the backstretch, four wide again through the
second turn, unable to keep pace with the top two through the lane, clear of the rest. POSEIDON WRATH back off the early pace, moved closer before a
half, pressed three wide through the second bend, had little left for the run to the wire. MY TY FU PEG pressured the pace three wide early, was finished
before a half. HALF MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER off a step slow, moved up inside, continued to save ground turn, challenged along the rail into the stretch, kicked clear then had
enough left late to last. MISTAKE PRESENT away in good order, settled in mid pack outside, four wide through the turn, set down for the drive, closed well
out in the middle of the strip to be rapidly getting to the winner in the waning strides. WILSON TO LOCKETT also broke with the leaders, chased in the two
path backstretch, moved closer late in the turn, stalled a bit in upper stretch, closed some ground late while outkicked for the second spot between foes. I'M
LOOKING UP broke sharp, cleared soon after, continued to set the pace in the two path through the turn, allowed the winner the rail into the lane, not
enough late while in the second flight for the show. DEBONNAIRE DUDE broke out and awkwardly, lacked speed inside, asked along into the lane, finished
up evenly. SUNNYONASTORMYDAY behind the pace off the inside, three wide into the lane, shifted out when straightened for home, lacked a closing kick.
PARK RIDGE BENNY outrun early, five wide exiting the turn, failed to muster a rally. OPENING QUARTER FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
SARATOGA PASODOBLE pressed the early leader from the outside, dueled in the two path through the turn, disposed of the other speed when
straightened for home, steadily increased advantage while drifted first out under a left handed crop then in right handed. CALL ME DARLIN moved up to
narrowly show the way up the backstretch along the inside, dueled through the turn with the winner, could not keep up in the drive, enough left to save the
place. MS. PRIESTLY off slowly, raced outside, four wide through the turn, improved into the lane, getting to the runner up late. STELLAR FANTASY ran off
three furlongs prior to the start, broke with the field, raced in the second flight while three wide into the lane, two path entering the stretch, failed to muster a
closing response. PEPPER POINT off slow, remained back throughout. BONJOOR MADEMOISEL very fractious while attempting to load, broke mid pack,
raced in the second flight early, stopped through the lane and jogged in. FRACTIONAL TIMES AND FINAL WERE HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GALAXY BUILDER in the second group to be unhurried early outside, ranged up to challenge four wide late in the turn, came five wide into the stretch, long
drive to the wire, fully extended to prove narrowly best. DOUBLE BARREL MAN behind the pace inside the winner, two path into the lane, dropped to the
rail when straightened for home for room, rallied up the inside, late bid, not enough for the winner late while gaining the nod for the place. DOCTOR LEO
forwardly placed outside, came four wide for the drive when moving closer, head and head past the furlong marker, blanket finish to narrowly miss while
between the top two at the wire. FATHER GOOSE alternated up front while closest to the inside, was in the two path entering the stretch, allowed the runner
up the inside when contending past midstretch, lacked a closing punch. SMOOTH COLLIERY narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, headed into the
turn when continuing to ensure a legit pace, regained the advantage midway on the turn, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
T R'S FIRST unhurried early, three wide through the turn, in some traffic late in the bend, steered out four wide to hit a seam upper stretch, set down,
closest with good energy to win going away. CUSTOM GUITAR underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, raced off the early pace outside, five wide through
the turn when beginning to advance, steered in a bit upper stretch when continuing to move, put a head in front past the furlong marker, led late, could not
contain the winner. A P HUMOR hopped at the start, was used to move up into a forward position the opening quarter, encountered some traffic late in the
turn, continued inside and edged clear for the show, not a serious threat late to the top two. SOUVENIR CHANNEL fractious prior to the start, raced back off
the pace and the inside, in traffic two path late in the bend, moved to the rail and improved with some belated interest. GRACE'S VISION in mid pack while
outside, four to five wide turn, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. HOUSE OF ZONG broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch
toward the inside, continued to lead through the turn then faltered when headed by the runner up nearing the furlong grounds. ABSOLUTELY MINDY
hesitated then was sluggish early to trail well back, continued to trail turn, five wide into the lane, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat.
SEEMYVALENTINE pressed the issue for three furlongs in the two path and began to give way. DOUBLE APPEAL forwardly placed early three wide, gave
way turn when four to five wide. QUARTER MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.
