Footnotes
BOURBON TEDDY was sent to the lead right out of the gate, showed the way from the two path up the backstretch and around the turn, and drew off down
the lane. BIG TIPPER chased the leader up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, challenged at the top of the stretch, could not go with the winner
and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. AMARI S. raced in the middle of the pack in the early going, navigated the turn from the two and three path,
offered a mild bid entering the stretch and was outkicked while finishing evenly. CONCOCTION raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path and passed tiring horses in the stretch. KING ZION trailed the field on the outside up the
backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and was empty from there. IN THE CLUB raced in the middle of the pack on the outside in the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and faded in the lane. SWEET TONIC bolted with his rider during the post parade, was caught by an
outrider and deemed fit to run, broke well and raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back from the two path around the turn and
tired further in the stretch.

Footnotes
MORRIE'S JOY was taken to the rear outside of NEW CHINA, began to improve when pushed along approaching the half mile mark and began to improve
in the three path, angled inward in upper stretch and rallied under a drive, engaged between the leading pair past the furlong mark, led with a sixteenth of a
mile to go and cleared. TAKE JOY raced three wide between horses in range into the first turn, settled back to chase outside of VIEWERS DISCRETION,
inched forward to track the leading pair outside of HARD LIKE HOLLY down the back straight, was pushed along for a two wide bid past the half, engaged
outside of WESTERN SKIES, led near the quarter pole, drifted out in upper stretch and lost the lead, kept on running and joined the leader along with
MORRIE'S JOY near the sixteenth but proved only second best from there. VIEWERS DISCRETION tracked inside into the clubhouse turn, settled back to
chase inside of TAKE JOY, continued to chase toward the rear down the backstretch, was pushed along in the two to three path around the far turn, swung
five wide into the lane, ran on willingly five wide and got up for the show. HARD LIKE HOLLY raced between horses into the clubhouse turn, tracked the
leading pair, continued to chase the leading pair in the two path on the far turn, took closer order in upper stretch, but was outfinished three wide between
horses late. WESTERN SKIES was keen to the lead and set the pace, took some mild pressure from SHE TAKES FLIGHT between the three quarters and
five eighths, cleared again approaching the far turn, saved ground around that bend, was headed by TAKE JOY near the quarter, took the lead again into
the lane as that one drifted out, carried a dwindling lead to the sixteenth pole until being headed for good by MORRIE'S JOY, and weakened. NEW CHINA
settled at the inside of the rear flight, continued at the rear down the backstretch, chased at the rear in the four to five path around the far turn, dropped to
the inside into the lane, and lacked a rally. SHE TAKES FLIGHT broke through the gate but was held in place by the assistant starter, passed fit to run and
was reloaded, broke out and lightly bumped MORRIE'S JOY in the opening strides, raced four wide into the first turn, advanced to prompt the leader into the
back straight, began to weaken in the four to five path around the far turn and had no more left for the drive.

REGULAR GUY saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three
path and rallied on the outside in late stretch to get up in the final strides. SEARCH ENGINE saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the
inside up the backstretch and around the far turn, dueled down the lane, was in tight quarters and brushed with THE BLACK STRAT near the sixteenth pole,
squeezed through that narrow hole and was caught. THE BLACK STRAT led the field under a hold around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while saving ground around the second turn, dueled gamely down the stretch, drifted in and brushed lightly with SEARCH ENGINE near the
sixteenth pole and gave way late. GITA'S LAD raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
far turn still in the two path, gained ground in the stretch and was narrowly outkicked between horses, just missing third. IWILLPERSEVERE trailed the field
from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the turn and was outrun.

RENEGADE BOB chased inside of OFFLEE FUN at the middle of the main group well behind a runaway leader, raced in the three path at the inside of the
rear flight around the turn, swung out to the six path in upper stretch and was driven between horses, rallied, led just past the sixteenth pole and cleared.
OFFLEE FUN was anxious in the gate, chased outside of RENEGADE BOB down the backstretch at the middle of the main group, raced in the four path
between horses with the rear flight around the turn, swung out to the seven path into the lane, was outkicked by RENEGADE BOB but chased on best of the
rest. OUR THOMAS settled at the rear, was pushed along approaching the seven sixteenths, raced in the five path with the rear flight on the turn, was
driven into the lane at the rear in the six to seven path, and kept on mildly for show. RED HOT DEVIL bounded clear while headstrong, set a quick pace
while well clear of the field down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch while still far ahead of the rest of the field,
faltered from the three sixteenths, was caught past the sixteenth pole and weakened. GIVIN UP NONE chased the runaway leader down the back straight
and in the two path on the turn, swung into the lane in the five path and failed to respond under a drive. DUE TO A PHOTO FINISH MALFUNCTION FINAL
MARGINS WERE DETERMINED BY EQUIBASE STAFF FROM VIDEO REPLAY.

SHEZ RECKLESS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground
around the turn, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off to the wire. SENORITA AURORA raced off the pace up the backstretch, saved ground around
the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground down the lane while never threatening the winner. AH LEAH chased the leaders up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, drifted in in midstretch and was outkicked from there. UPSIDE DOWN dueled on the outside up the
backstretch, maintained a slight advantage while racing in the three path around the turn and gave way in the final furlong. COOKIN ROSES raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the two path and offered no bid while finishing evenly. COUGER raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the three path and was empty in the stretch. HOOSIER GOLD CASE
trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path around the turn, swung wide entering the stretch and never fired.

Footnotes
BIZZEE CHANNEL was keen early but held up to track the leader outside of PALACE KITTEN, engaged outside of BETWITHBOTHHANDS into the far turn,
floated four wide into the lane while still just behind that foe, reeled him in approaching the furlong mark, and kept on well enough to hold CAPTIVATING
MOON at bay despite drifting out. CAPTIVATING MOON settled near the rear inside of SUMMER ASSAULT, was pushed along in the three path on the far
turn, swung out five wide into the lane, rallied under a drive with good interest but could not reel in the leader. SUMMER ASSAULT settled near the rear
outside of CAPTIVATING MOON, began to inch closer three wide near the nine sixteenths, was pushed along three wide in range around the far turn, kept
on with interest under a drive three wide in the lane between horses though was ultimately outkicked. AGGRESSIVITY settled at the rear, continued in the
three to four path at the back around the far turn, raced three wide to the lane, and drove past tiring horses. PALACE KITTEN tracked the leader inside of
BIZZEE CHANNEL, continued in range while racing in the pocket behind the leading flight around the far turn, was driven for an inside bid when space
inside of BETWITHBOTHHANDS opened up into the lane, rallied up the inside in upper stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong. BETWITHBOTHHANDS
soon led inside and set a reasonable pace, was engaged by BIZZEE CHANNEL to his outside near the seven sixteenths, carried a narrow lead while saving
ground around the far turn, raced two wide into upper stretch, kept on under a drive, was headed by BIZZEE CHANNEL near the furlong mark, and flattened
out two wide.

Footnotes
KREWE CHIEF bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path, began a bid passing the three sixteenths pole, gained ground on the outside and pulled clear while drifting mildly late. WINGING WAYS dueled on the
outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, and continued to battle down the lane, getting caught late and just holding second.
PRESIDENT ELECT bumped with the horses to either side leaving the gate, trailed well behind the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around
the turn, began a bid while swinging wide into the stretch and gained ground on the outside late, just missing second. CRANKSHAFT brushed with the
horse to his inside leaving the gate, led the field between horses up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn,
dueled in upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. PACHI bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack on
the outside up the backstretch and came up empty in the stretch. BABA LOU bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. AGAVE KID pressed the pace on the inside in the
early going, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further from there.

Footnotes
WAY TOO SMARTE chased the leading pair inside of IGGY BIGS around the first turn, took closer order into the backstretch, briefly took closer order
between but was taken back near the five eighths, was pushed along for a three wide bid on the far turn, swung out four wide into the lane under a drive,
responded with a rally, struck the front with a sixteenth of a mile to go and held off KINGSBURY DREAM. The latter settled at the inside of the rear flight,
edged up inside to take closer order approaching the half mile mark, waited in the two path behind horses around the far turn, came into the lane inside,
angled out past the three sixteenths to get around the flattening STOPSHOPPINGAMY, and rallied with good interest between horses for the place. CAT
ATTACK was keen to the lead, continued clear in the two path around the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch, ran on past midstretch, but was caught
with a sixteenth of a mile remaining. EMBARRASSING settled near the rear inside, inched closer approaching the half, chased in the two path on the far
turn behind the tracking flight, raced two wide into the lane, and kept on willingly though was ultimately outfinished. STOPSHOPPINGAMY was keen early,
tracked in range of CAT ATTACK, saved ground in the pocket behind that leader around the far turn, came two wide into upper stretch, drifted in and
weakened inside in the final furlong. NORTHERN ALLIANCE settled near the rear outside of EMBARRASSING, continued near the rear in the three path on
the far turn, swung four wide into the lane, shifted further out and passed tiring horses. SUMMER DAY raced two wide with the rear flight, edged up to take
closer order near the half, was urged for a four wide bid around the far turn, raced into the lane five wide under a drive and flattened out. IGGY BIGS chased
the leading pair around the first turn outside of WAY TOO SMARTE, continued to chase between horses down the backstretch and around the turn, and
came up empty three wide between horses in the lane. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THE HALF-MILE SPLIT WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
DOM CAETANO (ARG) raced in tight quarters in the two path around the first turn, settled in at the back of the pack through the next half mile, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far turn, kicked clear in the stretch and won going away. MAXIMILIANO pressed the pace between horses around
the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the far turn, couldn't go with the eventual winner in the stretch and chased after that
rival to the wire, the best of the rest. CARTE BLANCHE raced in the three path around the first turn, trailed the field on the outside up the backstretch,
improved position while racing in the two path around the far turn and continued to pass tiring horses while drifting out in the stretch. RIVER FINN pressed
the pace from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled three wide around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. PRINCE
OF MAYHEM saved ground around the first turn, maintained a short lead while racing inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail while saving ground
around the far turn and faded in the stretch. CAUSEIMCHOCOLATE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack for the run up the
backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and made no bid while drifting out late.

Footnotes
ROMANTIC ATTACK broke inward and bumped SILVERA in the opening strides, vied outside of that foe around the first turn, cleared into the back straight
and relaxed on the lead, continued on the pace in the two path around the far turn, was joined by PRINCESS CORA near the five sixteenths, turned that foe
back when asked in upper stretch, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, cleared, and held to the finish. SEAWARD settled near the rear inside of
WINDY CITY GIRL, raced at the rear of the main group down the back straight, began to improve into the far turn but checked off heels near the three
eighths behind the fading SILVERA, regained stride in the three path, rallied through foes in upper stretch, angled in to slip through another hole near the
furlong mark, and gained to the finish. ON A TOUR chased the leading pair inside through the clubhouse turn, chased inside just behind the tracking flight
down the back straight, was pushed along from midpack in the three path around the far turn, came four wide into upper stretch, kept on with good interest
to the finish but was outkicked for the place. KIMBERLY FRANCES trailed, began to gain some position in the two to three path on the far turn, was driven
inside in upper stretch, angled out gradually, and finished well belatedly four wide between horses. PRESENT OF HERO chased midfield inside, rallied
inside in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final furlong. SUNDAY SCHEMING settled toward the rear through the clubhouse turn, chased outside of
PRESENT OF HERO down the backstretch, chased in the four path around the far turn, floated six wide into the lane and drifted out further while driven,
and ultimately lacked the needed late kick. WINDY CITY GIRL raced two wide near the rear, continued two wide at the rear of the main group down the
back straight, was pushed along for a four wide rally around the far turn, swung seven wide into the lane, was carried out slightly further by SUNDAY
SCHEMING, and flattened. PRINCESS CORA was anxious in the gate, broke sharply but was wrangled back off the lead, chased the leading pair three
wide around the clubhouse turn, raced keenly into the backstretch and advanced to stalk the leader outside of SILVERA, rallied two wide on the far turn,
headed ROMANTIC ATTACK at the five sixteenths, was in close range in upper stretch, proved no match from the three sixteenths and weakened between
in the final furlong. HOT DAME bumped with SEAWARD in the opening strides, chased the leading pair between horses around the clubhouse turn, chased
two wide just behind the tracking flight down the back straight, was is in range three wide around the far turn, floated five wide into the lane and emptied out.
SILVERA was bumped by ROMANTIC ATTACK in the opening strides, vied inside of that foe through the firwt turn, settled back to track the pace into the
backstretch, began to fade into the far turn, shied against the rail near the three eighths, continued to weaken and was through for the drive.
