REMITTANCE SENT sped to the lead at the start, set the pace and held firm around the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch, widened advantage a
furlong and kept clear. DONNA'S HOPE chased two to three wide around the turn, hustled up two wide at the furlong marker and edged closer on the
winner. REDNECKER raced off the early speed, was ridden along two to three wide in the upper stretch and prevailed for a share. ISA'S NIGHT FLIGHT
raced in contention and saved ground around the turn, hustled up along the rail in the upper stretch, gained closer contention then ran on evenly late.
DELIGHT SURPRISE lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four to five wide into the upper stretch and failed to threaten. LULUS FLIGHT BOOTS
was forwardly placed and chased after the leader around the turn then flattened in the lane.

Footnotes
OIL MONEY sped to the lead soon after the start, widened to a clear advantage still racing in hand around the turn, saved ground into the lane, pulled away
from the field a furlong out, tapped a couple times in the final furlong and stayed sharp. CHICKS DIG SCARS tracked the pacesetter around the turn, given
cue two wide in the upper stretch, was no match for the winner but dug in gamely for second best. MOTO MOTO tracked the leader along the inside around
the turn, cut the corner and given cue in the upper stretch, was no match for winner but stayed on with response and got edged for place. JOE FRAZIER
was ridden along the inside around the turn, tipped three wide for the drive and lacked a needed rally. DOWNTOWNER was not too far back in early stages
then chased three wide around the turn and never threatened.

FUNANDFUNNY rated off the top pair heading into the turn, then given cue four wide approaching the head of the lane, gained a slim advantage at the
furlong marker then finished going away. BRODY BOUCHER was allowed to settle in the back in early stages and saved ground around the turn, cut the
corner and gained along the rail in the upper stretch, raced in strong contention a furlong out but failed to be a match for the winner and settled for second
best. FINISH LINE was not too far back in the early going and raced four wide around the turn, hustled up five wide into the upper stretch and captured
show. CLEARLY MAD led the way in the opening quarter then vied for the lead around the turn, fought back into the upper stretch then got collared by the
winner a furlong out and yielded. REVENIR tracked the leader in the opening quarter then advanced to duel outside of rival into the turn, continued to vie for
the lead into the upper stretch then flattened out late.

Footnotes
TOO LATE sped to the lead soon after the start and held clear around the turn, came three wide into the upper stretch, opened up to a commanding lead
and finished ridden out. CREATIVE ONE was forwardly placed racing just off the early leader, saved ground along the inside around the turn, sustained an
inside bid through the lane and dug in to capture place. HERZEN tracked in good position in the opening quarter, picked up the pace three wide around the
turn, stayed on two wide in the stretch run and got edged for place. CASEYS MEMORY was ridden along the inside near midpack entering the turn, saved
ground into the upper stretch and failed to move on. GOD'S PICK was off a step slow at the start, raced off the pace along the inside then chased three
wide around the turn and failed to threaten. GHOST ART broke out at the start, was not too far back in the opening quarter then flattened around the turn
and continued to weaken in the lane.

Footnotes
ADRIA sped to the lead at the start and held a slim lead around the first turn, set the pace just off the inside up the backstretch and held firm around the far
turn, was ridden along two wide into the upper stretch, widened advantage and kept clear under steady urging. TAKE ME AS I AM stalked the pace up the
backstretch then launched a bid at the quarter pole, stayed game in pursuit of the winner through the lane but had to settle for second best. STONECOLD
STUNNER was well reserved racing in the back then picked up the pace entering the far turn, hustled up three wide into the upper stretch and got up for
show. SASSY AIN'T I was allowed to settle in early stages, picked up the pace along the inside around the far turn, sustained inside bid into the lane and
just missed show. BAD OUTLOOK got bumped a bit at the start and settled off the early pace, hustled up two wide into the upper stretch and lacked a
needed rally. LONG MONDAY prompted the pace up the backstretch, launched a bid near the quarter pole then came up empty in the lane. XCARET raced
four wide around the first turn and tracked the pace up the backstretch, flattened out around the far turn, got carried out five wide into the upper stretch and
retreated.

MOON IN THE SKY settled nicely while being rated off the early pace, picked up the tempo leaving the backstretch and quickly advanced to threaten
LUCKS BIG BOY for the lead at the quarter pole, took command late on the far turn, widened advantage in the upper stretch and finished well clear. FAKE
SOLUTION was unhurried through early stages, made a move two to three wide around the final turn, sustained steady response through the lane and
finished clearly second best. GUN WAR tracked the pace up the backstretch, was ridden along the inside around the far turn, tipped two wide for the drive
and churned on for a share. LUCKS BIG BOY sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start and set a quick pace up the backstretch, got collared by the
winner leaving the quarter pole and steadily faded. GALACTIC EMPIRE was unhurried through early stages, hustled up two to three wide around the final
turn and never threatened. ORDER OF THE DAY stalked the quick pace up the backstretch, weakened mid-way around the far turn and continued to tire in
the lane. VISION OF ELIAS tracked the pace up the backstretch and weakened entering the far turn.
