Footnotes
B C GLORY DAYS coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn before tipping to the two path near the seven-sixteenths
advancing to take over at that station, knocked heads with SIXTY THREE S through the latter portion of the bend and cut the corner into upper stretch,
edged clear under a drive to prevail. SIXTY THREE S coaxed from the start, raced in aim of the leader six then five paths off the inside, tucked three wide
into the turn and advanced on the front in tandem with B C GLORY DAYS, tucked to the two path midway on the turn and dueled with that rival tipping three
wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away proving no match for the top one while keeping on well clear of the rest to be along second best.
RED JET sluggish early on, grew detached at the tail of the field chasing three wide, tucked inside through the turn coming under urging at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. REAP WHAT YOU SOW showed the way in hand
three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked briefly to the two path before taking the rail near the seven-sixteenths and came under quick
challenge getting overhauled from command at that station, got urged along through the turn in retreat, swung two to three wide into upper stretch and
faltered. JOSHUA hustled from the gate, raced four to five wide in aim of the leader, tucked three wide into the turn and faded ridden along with
seven-sixteenths to go, swung four wide into upper stretch and folded.

ROUGH TOUGH LOVE broke very alertly, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the two to three path around the turn, took the lead into upper stretch
then kicked clear and held under steady urging. DAWNLAND settled between horses, was urged along while moving from three to five wide around the turn
and finished willingly for the place. JACRODRA'S DEVIL settled on the inside of two foes, went around the turn in the two path and improved to get the
show. TASTY WAVE came away in good order then was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost
the advantage in the two path into upper stretch and tired. TRINITY TITOLI settled on the outside, went three to four wide around the turn, was roused near
the five-sixteenths and came up empty. THATS PRETTY NICE was urged along at the rear of the field, moved from the rail to the three path around the
turn, came four wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten.

pressure inside from ROSEMARY POTATOES, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the turn before taking to the
two path near the seven-sixteenths forcing ROSEMARY POTATOES to steady off her heels, tipped back three wide urged at the three-eighths, angled five
wide for home, proved no match for the top one while, weakened in the late stages while clear for the place honors. BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE got bumped
between foes at the start, chased five wide in closest aim of the leader before taking over five furlongs from home, tucked to the two path through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths under pressure to the outside, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and yielded the front straightened
away, then weakened in the stretch. ROSEMARY POTATOES broke out at the start bumping and squeezing BABYITSGOLDOUTSIDE and CLASSIC
VINMAN against pressure outside from KEMBA, showed the way early on four paths off the inside down the backstretch, got displaced with five furlongs to
run and tucked to the two path into the turn, had KEMBA tuck directly in front and was forced to steady off that rival's heels at the seven-sixteenths, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went five to six wide for home and faltered. CLASSIC VINMAN got bumped between foes at the start, chased three wide
until tucked inside through the turn, angled three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FINGAL'S CAVE showed early speed then dropped just off the pace, chased while moving from the two path to the four path around the turn, gained quickly
to take the advantage at the quarter-pole then kicked clear, drew off under a solid hand-ride into the final seventy yards then was eased up while much the
best. MRS. BOOMER showed speed then pressed the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back late on the backstretch, chased inside to the two path
around the turn and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. MADAME ROSE broke in and bumped with a foe then was hustled, moved up
to press the pace on the outside, vied in the three path on the turn, turned into the stretch between horses and weakened but was clear for the show.
BUSTIN BULLET stumbled badly at the start then bumped with a foe and dropped back, moved out under urging, dropped from the four path to the two path
early on the turn and failed to respond. SHANE'S RISK bumped with a foe at the start, showed good speed then set the pace under pressure, vied in the
two path on the turn, was headed at the quarter-pole and tired. STEPPIN' HAWK bumped with a foe at the start, moved out while urged along towards the
rear, went three to four wide around the turn and came up empty. CABERNET TRAIL was bumped on both sides at the start then taken up while in tight,
dropped well behind under urging, saved ground through the turn and was no factor.

THREE TWO ZONE was hustled from the gate, established a good position just off the pace, raced in the two path early on the turn, shifted three wide while
asked at the five-sixteenths, rallied to the lead into the stretch then shook clear, was given one tap of a down-turned crop outside the furlong marker then
lost the crop shortly thereafter, widened under a strong-hand ride until the final strides then was put to lighter encouragement while much the best.
FITZPATRICK was grabbed by the rider at the start and taken back then moved out, raced on the outside under reserve, was let out while four then five
wide on the turn and earned the place while no match for the winner. STAGE LEFT bobbled at the start but recovered quickly, disputed the pace on the
inside of a foe, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and weakened then lost the place but held the show. PRINCE
JAMES was hustled from the start, tracked the pace on the outside, chased three then four wide on the turn and tired. MUSICAL AMERICA was hustled
from the gate, contested the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and capitulated. BIG
ENGINE was urged along at the rear of the field, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MARINARA SAUCED broke a beat slow and grew detached at the tail of the field four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a good finish to close stoutly in tandem
with DREAMPOINT overhauling the leg weary leader inside seventy yards to the finish and got his head on the wire to best a rallying rival on the line.
DREAMPOINT three then two wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, closed well in concert with the
aforementioned foe to his outside and missed at the finish by a bob of the head. FEATHERS ROAD broke in at the start bumping RIPE FOR MISCHIEF in
tandem with EXCURSIONNISTE, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild
kick to secure the show honors. BUILT TO LAST hustled from the gate, dueled with CENTRAL PRIDE from the get go widening away from the rest through
swift splits, shook off his main pace rival with five furlongs to go and shook away through the turn, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a
drive leg weary nearing the eighth pole and under growing threat as his margin diminished quickly, got overhauled inside the final sixteenth when spent and
just preserved the last major share at the end. EXCURSIONNISTE broke out at the start bumping RIPE MISCHIEF in concert with FEATHERS ROAD,
chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn and was placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide for home and offered up a mild
bid. BUCKORTWO four paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. DEVIL OR ANGEL coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside until tucked inside
through the turn, continued along the inside route into upper stretch and offered no response. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF got bumped between foes at the start
who each broke his way, chased along the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CENTRAL
PRIDE dueled inside of BUILT TO LAST from the get go and widened away from the rest of the field quickly, got shaken off five furlongs from home and
chased the lone leader isolated through the turn between that rival and the rest of the field under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and tired. TYRANNOSAURUS REX four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and came up empty.

strongly to get the lead inside the furlong marker then edged clear under strong handling. TAPIZEARANCE was hustled from the start, contested the pace
on the outside, chased in the two to three path around the turn, re-bid near the five-sixteenths, gained the advantage coming to the quarter-pole, led under a
drive into the final furlong then was overtaken while able to hold the place. SICILIA MIKE was hustled from the start, settled towards the rear of the field,
moved from the two path to the four path around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and finished with good energy for the show. GANDY DANCING

the needed kick. NEW YORK'S FINEST broke a bit awkwardly, was urged along off the pace, moved out leaving the backstretch, dropped from the five path
to the three path early on the turn, tipped out into upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MISSION WRAPITUP was hustled from the start then
urged along off the pace, saved ground around the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, angled in outside the furlong marker and failed to threaten.

into the final furlong and tired. RUNNINGWSCISSORS was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, moved clear leaving the
backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was challenged around the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage coming to the quarter-pole and gave way. SOUTH

off under a drive and held clear to the finish. VETERANS BEACH chased three then two wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while running on to chase him home clear of the rest. COTTON chased along the inside under coaxing from
the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors in the very last jump to the finish. GOLQUIST
four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then weakened
in the late stages. UNCLE GEORGE bumped at the start by BALI'S SHADE, chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five
wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. SHERIFF BIANCO chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung six wide into
upper stretch, weakened. SANDRONE chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and
weakened. CITIZEN K just off the inside down the backstretch, went three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five
to six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. COOL LAOBAN chased just off the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide for
home and tired. BALI'S SHADE broke in at the start bumping UNCLE GEORGE, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. VOLKERT chased five to six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper

on the turn, dropped in some under a drive into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong then made a bid, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while
clear for the place. CERRETTA settled on the outside, ranged up four wide on the turn, took the lead passing the five-sixteenths, shook clear at the
quarter-pole, drifted out in upper stretch, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while clear for the show. INKBLOT broke in at the start,
prompted the early pace, took the lead with five furlongs to run, vied in the two path around the far turn, dropped back at the quarter-pole and tired. QUIET

three wide before the five-sixteenths, angled six wide outside the quarter-pole, came seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. MONDEUSE set
the early pace, lost the lead with five furlongs to run then dropped back, bumped with MISS MALALA while falling back fast on the far turn and stopped then
was eased but walked off. FALSE HOPE bumped lightly with a foe at the start then was hustled, settled well back in the field, went two to three wide on the
turn, collided strongly with RAYMOND ROAD after that foe struck BOCA KITTEN inside the five-sixteenths and unseated the rider then was walked off after
