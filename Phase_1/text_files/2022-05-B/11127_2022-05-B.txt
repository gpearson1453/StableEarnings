Footnotes
MOONSHININGBRIGHT broke alertly from the inside post and went straight to the lead, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail around
the turn, shook clear when set down into upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop inside
that marker then drifted out, took a straighter course into the final sixteenth and held under a strong hand-ride in the final seventy yards. INSPIRATION
POINT was coaxed from the gate then taken in hand briefly early, came back under urging on the outside, advanced four wide early on the turn, made a bid
with three furlongs to run, was put to the crop just inside the five-sixteenths, dropped back into upper stretch, pursued the winner under a drive into the final
sixteenth, gained on that foe late but missed while far clear for the place. SHARPOON raced just of the pace under some restraint, was hard held from the
half-mile pole to the seven-sixteenths, dropped from the two path to the rail later on that bend while roused, chased into the stretch and came up empty
while best of the rest. CUGINE dropped back while void of speed, moved out at the rear under urging, went four wide around the turn and failed to threaten.
DENIS became fractious in the gate and popped open the front of his stall door, came away in good order, moved up under urging to contest the pace on
the outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run and faltered.

Footnotes
RHUBARB MARTINI broke in at the start bumping ELEGANT LAOBAN, showed the way in hand just off the inside through moderate splits, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch under challenge, dug in under a left handed crop and drifted two paths before being
corrected, drifted once more two paths inside the eighth pole and then again inside the sixteenth marker another path all under an intermittent left handed
crop while under danger but maintaining a gap between her and her nearest rival and held on to prevail. SIMPLE SUGAR two to three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch issuing a challenge for command, dug in under a drive and had the leader
come out to look her in the eye, came under a left handed crop and drifted out slightly inside the eighth pole in concert with the leader, knocked heads
through to the finish shying out slightly just inside the sixteenth marker as the aforementioned foe drifted out for the last time and was ultimately rebuffed on
the wire. GAME THEORY bobbled at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, angled four wide into upper stretch and kept
on to secure the show honors gaining some ground late on the embattled top duo. GAGLIANO five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked
four to five wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and offered up late foot gaining
on the embattled top pair to the finish. ELEGANT LAOBAN got bumped at the start by RHUBARB MARTINI, raced forwardly placed along the inside early
on before settling just off the pace, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. RAINOUT stumbled
at the start, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. INTELLIGENCEREPORT
chased along the inside under coaxing from midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
PRICE DISCIPLINE bumped with a foe at the start, settled comfortably on the outside, went three wide early on the turn, shifted to the five path around the
three-eighths then ranged up on the outside, made a bid coming to the quarter-pole then took over into upper stretch, kicked clear outside the furlong
marker and drew away under a brisk hand-ride to prove much the best. CURLIN'S WISDOM broke very fast then settled off the pace, moved closer late on
the backstretch, was asked while shifting from the rail to the two path around the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch and finished willingly for the place.
OUR SON JAKE tracked the pace on the outside, was given his cue in the four path around the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, turned into the
stretch on even terms for the lead, lost touch with the winner outside the furlong marker and weakened but was best of the rest. TWO FOR CHARGING
showed in front early then was taken under a strong hold and relinquished the advantage, stalked the pace on the outside of the leader, was asked while
making a bid in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. KONG LOVES A FIGHT bumped with a foe at the start then
dropped back under urging while void of speed, moved from the inside to the two path around the turn, came three wide into the stretch then moved further
out in the drive and failed to threaten. PATRICK THE GREAT moved up under urging to take the lead then went clear with six furlongs to run, vied from the
two path to the inside around the turn, lost the lead outside the quarter-pole and faded.

from home, rebuffed that rival inside the sixteenth marker to inch away to the finish kept to task. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a bid to threaten the front a furlong out, then was ultimately repelled
through the final sixteenth while clear for the place honors. ANEJO broke out at the start brushing BREW PUB, chased three wide coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced through the finish. SIX PERCENT chased five then four wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. TROUBLESHOOTER chased four to five wide under a ride
from the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BREW PUB got brushed at the start by ANEJO, chased three then

Footnotes
BOSTON TEA PARTY tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path around the turn, took over into upper
stretch and powered away under strong urging. STREET FIGHT settled on the outside under some urging, stalked four wide around the turn, was put to a
drive into upper stretch, chased the winner to the wire and secured the place. EMBOITE (IRE) settled off the pace, saved ground under urging early on the
turn, shifted three wide late on that bend then came four wide into the stretch and improved to just get the show. PROVEN HOPE settled off the pace, was
urged three then four wide around the turn, came five wide into the stretch and just missed the show. URBAN FOREST settled off the pace, drafted behind
foes in the two path around the turn, was asked in the three path into the stretch, bobbled some inside the three-sixteenths then altered out a few paths
outside the furlong marker and lacked the needed response. CODYS EXPRESS bumped soundly with a foe at the start, went to the front, showed the way
on the inside, vied inside of two foes while along the rail on the turn and gave way. SAY IT LOUD raced just off the pace while taking choppy strides, made
a bid between horses leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path into upper stretch and faltered badly then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
VOODOO ZIP three wide down the backstretch in pursuit from the tail of the field, tucked inside through the turn and was patiently handled until placed to
coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch, tipped out two paths nearing the eighth pole to be clear and about five wide at that
station roused, offered up a good finish to close with a rush outside rivals and was up in the final jumps to the wire. INTO THE SUNRISE coaxed from the
gate, showed the way in hand along the inside through swift splits under patient handling until set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, held sway
under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in through to the finish and was nailed in the final strides. MATTA chased along the inside getting let out for the drive
spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick to the finish to secure the show honors willingly on the line. RUSTLER coaxed from the
start, chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the wire but was out-finished in the
late stages. MAXWELL ESQUIRE just off the inside in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on
through to the finish but was outkicked. CAJUN CASANOVA chased four then three wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, swung four to five wide into
upper stretch backing away when outrun and was eased home to the finish.

NO BURN was restless in the gate, moved up to contest the pace on the outside, shook clear in the two path early on the turn, dropped closer to the rail late
on that bend, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole and drew off under steady urging. CHRIS AND DAVE settled on the outside, was asked in
the three to four path around the turn, chased the winner into the stretch and proved no match while clear for the place. MUSICAL AMERICA was well
placed just off the pace, came under urging in the two to three path on the turn, chased the winner into the stretch and tired while best of the rest.
SUPREME AURA settled at the rear of the field, saved ground around the turn and failed to threaten. DARK STORM settled on the outside, was urged
along before the five-eighths, went three wide around the turn and came up empty. LOST IN ROME settled off the pace, was urged along in the two path on
the turn, came between horses at the five-sixteenths and was no factor. WENTZ broke in then was hustled to the lead, contested the pace on the inside of a
foe, dropped back along the rail with a half-mile to run and stopped.

Footnotes
FRONT MAN was taken back while in a bit tight against the rail when BINGO JOHN dropped in front around the opening bend, raced off the pace under
reserve, was asked in the two path around the far turn, swung four wide into the stretch, rallied outside to make a bid into the final furlong, gained the lead
around the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under good handling. SIX MINUS went three wide around the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, vied in the
two path on the far turn, gained the lead in the three path at the three-sixteenths, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was headed by the winner and missed
but was clear for the place. DANTE'S FIRE went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, saved ground for most of the far turn then shifted three
wide, was asked for his best in upper stretch and improved to just get the show. CORKMAN was bumped at the start and forced out then steadied, settled
near the back, was roused three then four wide around the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and just missed the show while able to get the last spot in
the superfecta. NOT YET CHARLIE was fractious in the gate and popped open the front of his stall, went to the front, showed the way while dropping from
the two path to the rail, lost the lead around the three-sixteenths, battled under a drive into the final furlong and weakened. GRECIAN PHAROAH went three
to four wide on the turns, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BINGO JOHN broke out and bumped a foe then lost his footing
briefly early, dropped from the two path to the rail on the first turn, was rated just off the pace on the inside, saved ground while asked on the far turn and
came up empty. FOREVER WICKED was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three to four wide on the turns and failed to respond.
