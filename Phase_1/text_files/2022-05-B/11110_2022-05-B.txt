Footnotes
SPACE RUNNER tracked in the two path, swung outside of the leading trio turning for home, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds, and edged away through
the late stages. AWESOME CRUSADER stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair approaching the lane, bid in upper stretch, led approaching
the furlong grounds, but was outkicked leaving that junction, and safely held show. COMMANDER BIZ saved ground far back, swung six wide entering the
lane, and rallied to reach show late. STAT vied for the lead two wide, led at the quarter pole, but was outkicked by a pair of outer rivals in upper stretch, and
gave way. SIR SAMUEL laid off of the pace in the three path, and stayed on. SON OF NEOLITHIC saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. STERLING
HARMONY set the pace inside of a vying rival, but was headed turning for home, and faded in upper stretch. CANYOUHEARMENOW took both turns in the
four path while off of the pace, and made little impact. BLANK'S HAT TRICK stalked outside of the top pair, but faded in the four path around the far turn.
EPIC RUN bumped the gate, trailed the field into the first turn while racing with climbing action, lagged well behind the field thereafter, and showed little.

Footnotes
BOURBON WISDOM set a clear pace along the rail, turned back bids nearing the lane, dug in inside of KOBLA MAS when that foe reached near even
terms in upper stretch, dueled inside and prevailed. KOBLA MAS raced off the early pace two wide, made a quick four wide move around the far turn,
reached near even terms outside of the winner in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip leaving the eighth pole and was turned back by the winner.
COLONIST settled off the early pace two wide, bid three wide midway around the far turn, but was outkicked by the top two in the final furlong. TIL THE
END raced three wide in midpack, edged closer around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. GO MIKE failed to menace while racing two and
three wide. UHTRED stalked the winner two wide in the clear for half, bid between foes midway around the far turn and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
CENTSLESS DRAMA set a clear pace while a bit off of the inner railing, maintained a margin through upper stretch, tired in the final furlong as rivals closed
in, but just lasted to the wire. SERENADE A KITTEN settled off of the pace two wide, was urged along to gain ground in the five path around the far turn,
sustained a rally through the final furlong to bid approaching the wire, but ran out of ground. LOVIN LIVIN trailed along the inside, shifted two wide in upper
stretch, but encountered traffic behind the leading group in the final furlong, altered course outwardly a sixteenth from home, and stayed on to reach show at
the wire. KHOSEA saved ground off of the pace, bid for place inside of rivals entering the final furlong, then kept on late, but was nailed for show. CLASSY
OF COURSE stalked outside of the clear leader around the first turn, attempted a challenge inside of that foe at the half mile pole, but failed to produce a
bid, chased that rival from the three path around the far turn, then yielded between horses in the final furlong. ISADORABLE AIDA tracked along the inside,
then from the four path around the far turn, but lacked a kick between horses through the lane. ISLA BONITA raced at the rear two wide, and was outrun.
DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED, RUN-UP DISTANCE UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
FRANKLY MY DEAR stalked the dueling trio inside, angled three wide in upper stretch, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. ELUSIVE
MOLLY was sluggish at the start, raced well back inside, angled four wide near the quarter pole, rallied outside and was up for the place in the final strides.
FLYING ALETHA dueled inside of a pair of foes to upper stretch, drew clear nearing the eighth pole, led to the sixteenth pole and lost second in the final
strides. RESTOFTHESTORY dueled three wide to upper stretch and weakened in the lane. GREAT ADVENTURE dueled between foes for three furlongs
then retreated. GREY CHARLOTTE played no factor while racing four wide. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
MILITARY DRILL bumped an inner rival while breaking on top, stalked three wide, bid for the lead outside of the pace setter entering the lane while under a
stern drive, led in upper stretch, inched clear passing the furlong grounds while hanging on his left lead, changed over as an outer BEE BY THE SEA
threatened entering the final sixteenth, drifted out through the closing stages while meeting that foe's challenge, and held desperately. BEE BY THE SEA
took a bump from an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path around the turn, picked up stride while shifting five wide entering the lane,
rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final furlong, flopped back to his left lead while being herded outwardly by that drifting foe entering the final
sixteenth, sustained his charge and ranged up approaching the wire, but missed via a very tight phot. SKY BRIDGE broke outwardly, took the turn in the five
path while far back, came into the lane six wide, and rallied outside of foes to reach show before being mildly herded outwardly in the late stages. FREE
FLAYME raced close up inside of the pace setter early on, backed off to stalk entering the turn, shifted to the three path in upper stretch, but only managed
to chase the leaders home. ZAMFIR set the pace two wide early on, cleared his inner counterpart with three furlongs remaining, showed the way while well
in hand around the turn, came under urging entering the lane as MILITARY DRILL menaced, but lacked a response, got headed in upper stretch, and
weakened while hanging on his left lead. ROYAL WAR took a bump to his hind quarters from an outer rival and was knocked off stride soon after the start,
chased from midpack in the four path, but lacked a bid before yielded between foes in midstretch. QUICK ENOUGH shifted in and bumped ROYAL WAR a
few strides out of the gate, then lagged well behind the field and showed little. THE RIDER OF BEE BY THE SEA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINS THE RIDER
OF MILITARY DRILL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

THE VIRGINIAN stalked the duel two and three wide, seized command leaving the eighth pole and drew clear under a drive. WARRIOR'S PRIDE dueled
two wide to midstretch, could not match strides with the winner but stayed on to outfinished his pace rival for the place. TAPE TO TAPE dueled inside to
midstretch and weakened. MAI TY ONE ON chased the pace three wide and lacked the needed rally. TIZ ROMANTIC was fractious in the starting gate,
saved ground and failed to menace. REAL TALK hit the rail entering the turn, raced two wide around most the bend and trailed throughout. RUN-UP

Footnotes
STARSHIP NUGGET raced in midpack two wide, came under stout urging to move forward between horses into the turn, sustained her advance around the
turn to bid for the lead at the quarter pole along with a pair of outer rivals, then gained an advantage from an inner foe at the furlong grounds, and drew
clear. SADE PURSE settled at the rear two wide, advanced between horses into the turn before gaining in the five path around the bend, moved to striking
range turning for home, but only managed to chase a bidding STARSHIP NUGGET through the lane, and gained place late. RUBYSA was hustled between
horses out of the gates to be prominent early, dueled outside of BELLA ROMANCE, cleared after that foe faltered at the five sixteenths pole, showed the
way from a trio of bidders entering the lane, but was headed by the eventual winner in midstretch, yielded, and lost place late. STACIAS RUBY stalked in
the four path, gained outside of the eventual winner around the turn to bid for the lead between horses turning for home, but failed to keep pace in upper
stretch, and tired. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN rated far back along the inside, shifted off of the railing entering the lane, and moved up while failing to threaten.
BRASS BAND stalked along the inside, but faded with three furlongs to go. MA COCO raced far back in the five to six path around the turn, and made little
impact. BELLA ROMANCE dueled for the lead inside of RUBYSA, but weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole. DATTTSAFANCYFOX laid off of the
pace four wide, and tired entering the lane.

Footnotes
VETTORI KIN (BRZ) saved ground off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, seized command near the sixteenth pole and drove
clear. DOUBLEOSEVEN stalked the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn, took the lead in midstretch and was overhauled
near the sixteenth pole. OFFICER COUNTRY steadied entering the first turn, raced three wide around that bend, edged closer two wide around the far turn,
bid between rivals in midstretch, steadied near the eighth pole and stayed on to gain the show. BENELUX was devoid of speed while saving ground, moved
up a bit two wide around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. ESPECIALLEA raced off the pace four wide around both turns, bid in
upper stretch but flattened out in the final furlong. ROBINTAKINCHARGE pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole, led to
midstretch and weakened. HEZA KITTEN failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BORU steadied early, raced off the pace two and three wide
and was blocked throughout the stretch turn. SPINNING KITTEN was up close inside and came up empty in the lane. JUPITER BLUES set a pressured
pace along the rail and faltered nearing the lane. DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER checked repeatedly while racing erratically through the opening half and
retreated around the far turn. RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

Footnotes
STARLITE WALKER set the pace inside of a pressing BADBADBOBBY while a path off of the inner railing, met that foe's bid at the five sixteenths pole, but
shook free of that rival in upper stretch, drew clear, and held sway. MITICO stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair passing the quarter pole,
vied for place in midstretch while not threatening the clear leader, and prevailed for that position. BADBADBOBBY prompted the pace setter from the
outside while kept in the three path by that rival, vied at the five sixteenths pole, but was repelled in upper stretch, yielded while hanging on his left lead,
battled for place inside of MITICO through the final furlong, but lost that position late. BEN COPENHAGEN chased outside of the top pair and from the four
path, but tired turning for home. PROUD CONTENDER trailed along the inside, then improved between horses in the closing stages. HEY PORTER broke
slowly and spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the start, raced off of the pace along the inside, but failed to threaten, then was dismounted and untacked
in the vicinity of the seventeen-sixteenths pole before walking off. HOORAYHOORAYHOORAY laid well off of the pace in the three path around the turn,
and made little impact.

Footnotes
WILLY BOI stalked the clear leader from the outside, ranged up approaching the lane to produce a bid entering it, and swiftly kicked clear. KING CAB sped
clear in the early stages, showed the way via a loose advantage in the two path around the turn, encountered WILLY BOI's challenge entering the lane, but
offered little resistance to that foe in upper stretch, and remained well clear of show. SHIVAREE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the four path
and between horses entering the lane, bid for show in the final furlong, and prevailed. SIR OLLIE chased the leader from the three path around the turn, but
failed to keep pace with the top two entering the lane, and lost show in the late stages. ROUGH ENTRY raced off of the pace in the five path, and failed to
menace through the lane. CAJUN'S MAGIC trailed in the five to six path around the turn, and improved position. WELL DEFINED stumbled severely at the
start, raced far back in the four path into the turn, tucked to the rail turning for home, but failed to factor. GATSBY chased from midpack in the four path into
the turn while under intermediate coaxing, and weakened between horses at the quarter pole.
