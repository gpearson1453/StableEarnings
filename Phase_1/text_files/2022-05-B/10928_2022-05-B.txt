Footnotes
BAROSSA bobbled at the start and got away last, raced three wide through the first turn, continued to chase the pace while in the three path, was asked for
more in mid-turn, bid three wide into the lane, joined one of the pacesetters when straightening in the lane, dueled with that one the final eighth and inched
up late. RANDELLO vied for the lead from the outset while two wide, continued on near even terms into late turn, shook off challenger while straightening
but was joined by the winner soon after, dueled with that one through the lane and was outfinished late in a game effort. PERFECT SILENT CAT was
unhurried while in the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and never was a threat while moving up. DREAM KEEPER vied for
the lead along the inside through the far turn then gave way entering the lane. CARTIER CAT was never a factor while racing two wide through the far turn.
TOSS OF FATE saved ground throughout and was empty.

Footnotes
LEAVE IT TO KITTEN was in the four path into the turn, bid three wide after mid-turn, swung into the lane from the four path then drew away while being
tapped of the shoulder a couple of times. ROCKY RUSH chased the pace from the three path into the far turn, bid from the three path with the winner into
the lane, could not stay with that one while staying on to gain the place spot. CLEARING WAIVERS hopped at the start, hustled up to set the pace into the
first turn, continued with the lead into the lane then yielded to the top two while clear for the show spot. BAD BOY was in the three path through the turn,
came into the lane from the two path and never was a threat. TOMAHAWK KITTEN saved ground through the turns, moved up in the lane but was never a
serious threat. DUEL FUEL chased the pace along the inside then weakened in the lane. FEVER TEMPLE was never a factor while in the two path through
the far turn. UPON RECEIPT OF A RULING (IG-2022-2687) FROM THE INDIANA HORSE RACING COMMISSION, LEAVE IT TO KITTEN WAS
DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED LAST DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
MANSFIELD TIGER vied for the lead two wide through the turn, repelled challenger in mid-turn then was joined by another, continued with a short lead into
the lane, shook that challenger off then was kept to the task to keep the runner-up safe. OVERTHETOPJUSTICE was unhurried while in the two or three
path, bid three wide into the lane and gained momentum from the four path while gaining on the top one. CIELO BLU saved ground into the far turn, came
off the inside to pass tiring one, was in the two path into the lane and showed late energy to just be up for the show spot. ROYAL ICING pressed then
settled back to chase the pace through the turn, bid into the lane and appeared a serious threat then weakened in deep stretch. BOOK OF ROMEO was in
the four path through the first turn, continued off the inside through the far turn when toward the back, swung into the lane from the five path and offered a
mild gain while not a threat. GRAND IN BAY was never a factor while in the two path through the far turn. NATES HEARTTHROB never a factor while in the
two path through the turns. COWBOYS CAN'T CRY never a menace while in the two path. HENRY RULES vied for the lead along the inside into mid-turn
then was suddenly done.

Footnotes
ACUTELY chased the pace from the three path through the turn, bid into the lane, gained the lead outside the eighth pole then drew away through the final
sixteenth. LIL EVIE chased the pace from the three path, bid into the lane from the five path, was a serious threat once straightened, was no match for the
winner and stayed on to hold the place spot. NO TRUST raced in the two path through the turn when towards the back, continued in the three path into the
lane and moved up. EVERYTHING'S ROSY was unhurried while in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and
improved position. LEXI SUN set the pace from the two path through the turn then gave way entering the lane. HOLY JUSTICE saved ground through the
turn and lacked a bid. COMPRESSED ENERGY raced well back while moving from the three or four path through the turn, straightened into the lane from
the nine path and never factored. UNBRIDLED VICTORY chased the pace from the two path and faded through the lane. FLIRTY DANCER was never a
menace while in the three path through the turn and finishing in the five path. SISTER JUSTICE was never a factor while in the four path through the turn.

path, bid in the four path at the three-eighths pole but then couldn't match strides with the winner. SETNA THE WISE was off awkwardly, dueled outside of
the winner in the three path but couldn't stay with that one in the stretch. SLIM SLOW SLIDER saved ground early, was steadied on the first turn, angled out
down the backstretch, bid five wide near the three-eighths pole but couldn't close late. WAKE SURF stalked the pace inside, bid at the quarter pole, then
couldn't close late.
