Footnotes
CASH EXPRESS set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. SUMMER ASH settled off the early pace, advanced in the three path around the
turn, had aim outside of the winner nearing the lane but was no match for that foe. DEN STREET was off slow, steadied early, raced four wide and was
along for the show. CATCHING MAGIC chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the lane. EL POLICIA failed to menace while racing five wide.
GRAVE DANGER was bumped into another foe at the start, raced three wide never threatened. TWELVE O'CLOCK broke inwardly and bumped GRAVE
DANGER into MOON AT MIDNIGHT just after the start, saved ground and played no further factor. BOLD PLAY pressed the pace three wide and faltered
nearing the lane. NOT A DANCE chased the pace inside, steadied entering the turn and retreated. MOON AT MIDNIGHT was soundly bumped at the start,
raced two wide and made little impact. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

JEALOUS BOYFRIEND pressed VALHALLA AIR BASE from outside, poked a head in front after a half-mile, edged clear past the eighth-pole, then lugged
in from right-hand pressure while widening. VALHALLA AIR BASE set the pace inside, steadied slightly as JEALOUS BOYFRIEND went by in deep stretch,
and remained clear of the remainder. WILD TEXAS TOM saved ground on the turn, and could not gain through the lane on his left lead. VOLTE FACE
broke slowly, raced two wide between horses into the turn, and never menaced. GIVE ME TWO STEPS gave chase three wide for a half, and tired. AN
OBJECTION AGAINST THE WINNER BY THE RIDER OF VALHALLA AIR BASE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT
ALLOWED. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

JUMP BACK JACK set a pressured pace along the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch then just lasted. CHARGING AERO vied two wide between foes,
continued on the left lead in the lane, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch but fought on between foes to just miss late. HELL'S KITTEN
disputed the pace three wide outside of the top two, battled to the wire but was outfinished. SENOR GEE chased the pace two and three wide, tipped four
wide in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. RARE JEWEL went evenly inside. THE BIG CALICO was off a step slow and trailed throughout.
RUN-UP UNAVAILABLE.

RACHEL'S ROCK tracked outside early, took over outside SHAWNEE PRINCESS after a half-mile, and drove clear. MADEFORSUMMER raced forwardly
toward the inside, moved out a bit for the drive and rallied to be clearly second best. SPIRIT OF POWER saved ground outsprinted early, came widest for
the stretch run and improved position without threatening. SHAWNEE PRINCESS sped clear early, yielded to the winner approaching the stretch, and faded
steadily. MOULY raced three wide and lacked the needed response. KITTEN'S APPEAL hit the left side of the gate and was slowest away, and tired after a
half-mile. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

NANA FANNY pressed the pace two wide between horses, took over after six furlongs and drove clear. HIGH VIBES saved ground to midway on the far
turn before shifting out three wide, went back inside for the drive and rallied for the place. WINNING AT EASE broke a step slow, advanced with a four-wide
bid after six furlongs, but flattened out in the lane. VANDALIA broke a step slow, lodged a three-wide bid between horses on the far turn, then flattened out.
HEIR TO THE ROAR got sandwiched between horses at the break, raced three to four wide on the far turn, and could not gain appreciably. DANCIN DEE
cleared to the lead around the first turn, showed the way to the far turn, and gave way. SUSANS NOVELA broke in bumping HEIR TO THE ROAR, steadied

rallied outside, switched leads and took over near the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. PARDON MY HEART settled off the pace while racing two wide,
advanced four wide around the far turn, bid between foes in midstretch but was no match for the winner late. SWEET ACTRESS saved ground off the pace,
steadied nearing the quarter pole, bid inside of foes in the lane but was outkicked. DONTMESSWITHTESS pressed the pace three wide around the first

Footnotes
R PRIVATE JET sprinted clear early, showed the way slightly off the rail to the stretch, widened under a mild drive through the furlong grounds and was
geared down late. CAPTAIN CAJUN hugged the rail throughout, stayed on his left lead through the stretch and fought gamely to get the place. ADVANCE
CASH bumped with KHOCU at the start, was ridden along trying to keep up outside R PRIVATE JET on the turn, could not stay with that one and was
outfinished for second. ENSIGN PARKER tossed his head around unsettled early behind and between horses, moved out widest for the drive and could not
gain. DOO WOP DON faded after a half-mile three wide. KHOCU took the worst of a bump with ADVANCE CASH at the start and was slowest away, and
remained in arrears dropping far back. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

HROTHGAR was in range four wide, advanced four deep around the far turn, seized command near the eighth pole and drove clear. TAKEMYSHOT
stalked the early pace four wide, bid three wide nearing the far turn, drew clear around that bend, led to midstretch and lasted for the place. PAPA
CHARLES raced well back inside, advanced five wide around the far turn and finished well to gain the show. COMPASS CAY checked early, was tugging
under a hard hold between foes around the first turn, raced in range two wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. REGIO settled off the pace
while racing three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out. CAPTURE MI chased the pace
inside and lacked a closing bid. MEAN JOE BRO vied inside for five furlongs and faded. GLORY AND VICTORY was outrun while racing three and four
wide. FREDDY'S MUSIC steadied early and played no factor while racing four and five wide. PRINCIPE broke awkwardly and was outrun inside. DUKE
SKYWALKER set the pace two wide, briefly cleared and angled in late on the first turn, led down the backstretch then retreated around the far turn. THIS
RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.
