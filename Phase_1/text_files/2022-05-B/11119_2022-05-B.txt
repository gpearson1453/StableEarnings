backstretch, moved up in the two path leaving the far turn, moved to the inner rail in upper stretch and flattened out. NEVERFOLD chased the pace two
wide for six furlongs, drifted three wide entering the stretch, failed to keep pace late and was steadied in close quarters near the finish. ORO GRIS bumped
the winner when coming in at the break, was far back to the stretch and showed a late move. OBOY set the pace along the inner rail and gave way.
PLAYING GOLD , three wide the first turn, angled in and raced along the inner rail down the backstretch then retreated after five furlongs. An objection by

Footnotes
FLIRTATIOUS LASS cleared early and dropped in to set the pace, came under pressure into the lane, kept on under left handed asking past mid stretch,
switched over to her left lead near the sixteenth pole and held firm. A GIRL NAMED JAC eased out two wide into the turn and stalked the winner, was under
asking giving pursuit into the lane, loomed in mid stretch, continued gamely but was kept at bay. THIEF OF HEARTS , off slowly after being bumped, had
her rider adjust the left iron soon after, was taken wide then circled the turn four wide, moved up near mid stretch then failed to seriously sustain in the final
sixteenth. SAX , three wide outside a rival stalking the pace, failed to kick on with the leaders soon into the lane, shifted in and faded. HUFFLEPUFF came
in at the break bumping THIEF OF HEARTS, regrouped and raced well back, saved ground leaving the far turn but failed to respond.

NEVER SILENCED sped clear early, set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away into the lane, kept on under right handed asking near the sixteenth
pole and held sway. SURPRISE HELLO , two wide inside foes early on, stalked the winner around the turn and kept on gamely while closing the gap and
holding down the place. MAILMAN'S A FLYER broke outward into the path of I'M JUNETEENTH, chased three wide between rivals while pursing the pace,
brushed with FROG PRINCE leaving the three sixteenths and rallied. DOC ROCK bobbled at the break, lost ground four to five wide outside rivals, circled
into the lane but lacked a solid finish. FROG PRINCE , three to four wide between horses, was brushed and in tight in upper stretch and faded. I'M
JUNETEENTH stumbled when put in close at the break, raced well back while saving ground and failed to menace.

PICTOR lacked his usual speed, swung to the four path leaving the backstretch, remained wide on the turn, advanced outside horses to take command
inside the eighth pole then drew clear under energetic urging. THE WOLFMAN , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, moved over
to the two path on the turn, gained a short lead between horses near the eighth pole then weakened. ROCK AND FELLERS (ARG) saved ground on the
turn while setting the pace and gave way the final furlong. SHOULDA HAD IT , steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, was not a factor and
swung four wide leaving the turn. VICTORY GIVEN saved ground on the turn and weakened through the stretch.

JARDANI settled off the pace while saving ground, angled out leaving the far turn, advanced under a ride while our wide into the lane, forged past the leader
nearing mid stretch and eagerly widened under a drive. CROSSLAND had speed to the inside of SYNCOPATED into the first turn, rated back off that one
past the seven eighths and angled out, rebid two wide past the three eighths, led into the lane, failed to contain the winner in mid stretch but kept on willingly
to be clear of the rest. RIPKEN , three wide early, dropped in leaving the far turn, came back out to pursue into the lane, made a bit of a run then flattened
out. PURSUING PACE , two to three wide off the early pace, passed tiring rivals. SYNCOPATED vied outside a rival into the first turn then cleared, dropped
in to set the pace, was joined nearing the five sixteenths, stayed on to upper stretch the retreated. ESPRESSO LUNGO pulled his way up behind rivals then
steadied around the first turn, edged up four wide past the half, drifted in and bumped a rival near the three eighths, continued to drift in and weakened.
ICANDOTHAT , three wide with chase, steadied when put in close nearing the far turn, failed to kick on and faded. DYNAMITE DUKE , three wide, was
bumped near the three eighths and weakened. DREAMING OF RAQUEL , four wide into the backstretch, was outrun. LUCKY HERB saved ground and
faltered.

Footnotes
BAD TEMPER angled in to secure the rail into the first turn, was a touch rank soon after, settled into the backstretch and tracked the pace, edged up behind
the dueling leaders then awaited room past the three furlong pole, eased out three wide nearing the lane, forged to command in upper stretch and drew
away to a convincing win while ridden out. COLOROFACLOUD prompted the pace two wide, bid after a half mile, dueled leaving the far turn, kept up the
fight into the lane, was no match for the winner but continued with effort to be clear of the rest. DIVINE VICTORY checked off heels into the first turn,
regrouped and angled out to stalk, took aim four wide nearing the quarter pole but lacked a serious stretch response. SATISFIED saved ground and was not
a factor. KISSES FOR HANNAH cleared around the first turn, set the pace towards the inside, dueled from the far turn to upper stretch then weakened.
MEJORAMIGA , in closer at the break, faltered and was eased. An objection by the rider of DIVINE VICTORY against the winner for alleged interference
entering the first turn was not allowed.
