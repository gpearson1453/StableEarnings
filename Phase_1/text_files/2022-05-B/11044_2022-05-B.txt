Footnotes
BECKETT'S LUCKYDAY pressed the pace racing close up outside of KALEO, bid on the far turn, dueled with that rival, gained a short lead and dug in
gamely in the final furlong to maintain the edge. KALEO set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch
drive, battled on to the end but second best. INCA EMPIRE raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, came three wide into the lane, closed mildly
outside and was up late for third. ROWDY RASCAL raced three wide early, stalked three wide, chased three wide on the far turn and lacked a winning bid.
OUR CORNERSTONE raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten.
