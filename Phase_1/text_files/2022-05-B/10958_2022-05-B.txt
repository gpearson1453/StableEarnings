Footnotes
SUPERSTAR DIVA dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid leaving the turn and shifted off the rail, shook clear and then widened the margin in the
final furlong to prove best under a drive. HER GOLD MINE was well placed early on the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the drive,
finished willingly to be up to be second best. FANCY EMPRESS was rated four to three wide, then came six wide into the lane and offered a belated rally to
gain the show award late. FOOT RUB LOVE dueled for the lead three wide to the quarter pole and then faded in the drive, lost show award late. SINGING
ALLI was settled early while two wide and then had no response in the drive on the inside.

SENORA ROMA set the early pace on the inside while clear, then turned back the bid from MOM'S RED LIPSTICK leaving the turn and shook clear, then
held on gamely late to prove best under a drive. RICHIES GREAT GIRL was reserved early, saved ground on the turn, swung wide into the lane and closed
the gap fast late. WILDWOOD'S BEAUTY was well rated early on the inside, advanced on the inside on the turn and shifted out three wide leaving the turn
but needed more. MOM'S RED LIPSTICK stalked the pace two wide and made a bid on the turn to challenge for the lead, then drifted out leaving the turn
and weakened in the final furlong. GET NONE lacked a rally. JETS A GINNIN tracked the early pace three wide and weakened.

SKYLINE set the early pace on the inside, drew clear on the turn and then maintained a safe margin late. KING OF THE KIDS was rated along the inside on
the turn, angled out in the stretch and rallied. YO DAWG chased the early pace three wide, came four wide into the lane, steadied slightly by the furlong
marker and then hade a late rally. J J'S SOLUTION was bumped leaving the half mile marker, then saved ground on the turn and finished well late on the
inside. LARK bumped a rival while hard to handle early, swung out wide for the drive and had no kick. ROCKET MAN ATTACK tracked the early pace and
shifted out three wide leaving the turn but was empty. GOLD SMOKE failed to menace. ROBERT WHO was off a step slow, no factor.

COWBOYS DREAM was off slowly and then bumped and stumbled after the start, reserved early, advanced four wide on the far turn, came five wide into
the drive and made a bid leaving the turn and drew away to prove much the best under a drive. PACKED HOUSE stalked the early pace and made a three
wide bid on the turn, gained a short advantage leaving the turn but proved to be no match for the winner while saving the place award.
TALLESTOFTHETALL chased the early pace on the inside, was shuffled back on the far turn, angled out in the upper stretch and came again late to just
miss the place award. FAST ONE set the early pace while clear on the inside, was headed leaving the turn and gave way in the final furlong.
IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT chased the pace and made a mild bid three wide on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
WAVE OF GOODNESS settled toward the rear the first time down the stretch, chased inside through the clubhouse turn and the back straight, was a bit
keen between horses into the far turn, improved two wide past the three eighths, swung out five wide into the lane, angled slightly further out, rallied under a
drive, found her best near the sixteenth mark and got up in time. SENSE OF SELF tracked the leading pair inside of ZANDREA'S the first time down the
stretch, tracked in the pocket inside of LADY CLARE around the first turn and down the back straight, tracked just behind the leading line in the two path
around the far turn, jumped and hit the rail near the quarter pole, nonetheless rallied inside under a drive in the lane, came in on GOOD MONGOLIA past
midstretch, led with a sixteenth of a mile to go, and was caught late. GOOD MONGOLIA sent for speed and set the pace, was prompted by LADY CLARE
down the backstretch, felt more pressure into the far turn while racing at the inside of the leading flight, raced two wide into the lane while still on a narrow
lead between horses, was bumped by SENSE OF SELF past the furlong mark, was headed by that foe near the sixteenth, but kept on willingly for show.
ZANDREA'S tracked the leading pair outside of SENSE OF SELF early, chased three wide around the clubhouse turn, bid three wide on the far turn and
joined the leading flight past the three eighths, raced four wide into the lane, came out on LADY CLARE in upper stretch, chased on between but was
outfinished. NOFANSINTHESTANDS was bumped by BEYOND PROPER in the opening strides, settled at the rear, trailed in the three path around the far
turn, raced three wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. BEYOND PROPER broke outward, settled two wide toward the rear, bid four wide around the
far turn, came five wide into the lane, kept on in range past the furlong mark and flattened oate. LADY CLARE tracked the pacesetter two wide, advanced
down the backstretch to prompt outside of GOOD MONGOLIA, engaged in earnest between horses around the turn while in a bit tight, raced three wide into
the lane, was bumped by ZANDREA'S when that foe came inward in upper stretch, and weakened from midstretch.

early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and weakened in the drive, lost show award late. MARESONOFAGUN was well placed early towards the

Footnotes
WILLING TO SPEED tracked the loose leader around the clubhouse turn, chased between horses down the backstretch until beginning to edge closer to
the pacesetter past the five eighths, encroached two wide outside the pacesetter around the far turn, vied from the five sixteenths into upper stretch, went to
a drive briefly past the three sixteenths, cleared into the final furlong and drew off under a hand ride late. ITS MY BAG BABY was sent for pace, dictated
terms while clear and racing a bit keenly, was engaged by WILLING TO SPEED to his outside past the seven sixteenths, vied inside him from near the five
sixteenths into upper stretch, went to a drive inside but proved no match for WILLING TO SPEED approaching midstretch, and chased on a clear second
best. IRISH MAJOR settled near the rear well behind the main group, hugged the rail on the far turn, began to improve inside approaching the quarter pole,
proved no match for the leading pair in the lane but chased on willingly to prove best of the rest. ROAR OF THE LION trailed, swung into the lane in the five
path, went to a drive in upper stretch, drifted out in upper stretch, and passed tiring horses while drifting back in late. MR. LUV MAKER chased the leading
pair two wide through the clubhouse turn and three wide down the back straight, tracked the leading pair in the three path on the far turn, began to weaken
near the five sixteenths and offered no more in the lane. FEELING DANGEROUS chased the leading pair inside of MR. LUV MAKER through the clubhouse
turn, raced at the inside of the chasing flight down the back straight, tracked the leading pair in the two path on the far turn, was pushed along from the five
sixteenths, proved no match for the leading pair in upper stretch and weakened.
