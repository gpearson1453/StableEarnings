FIRINGTOTHEFRONT broke alertly then settled outside, easily swept past the leaders on the turn then eagerly drew off under moderate urging.
FIRSTSLATE vied along the inside, was no match for the winner but continued willingly to earn place. LUCKY LINZ dropped well behind inside then showed
some late energy. BELMAR BEAUTY chased wide throughout and lacked a solid response. AREYOUINABAND dueled outside to midway on the turn then
drifted out fading in the stretch.

COWBOY HAY HAY dropped back early, advanced on the turn, was blocked near the quarter pole, swung extremely wide into the stretch, surged and was
up in time. ON TILT vied along the inside four across midway on the turn, moved clear but was caught in the final yards. PAYNT YOUR WAGON prompted
the pace in the two path, raced between foes on the turn and finished willingly. DOUBLE BOGEY bid four wide on the turn then proved empty in the stretch.
SODBUSTER ducked out at the start then swerved wide, moved inside on the turn and was no threat. AMERICAN CHAOS was urged close up three wide
between foes on the turn then gave way.

SHADY GRADY took over before half a mile, vied through the final turn, repelled an outside challenge then edged away through the stretch while kept to
urging. DEMURO firmly rated inside rivals early, went after the winner on the final turn, proved no match but was clearly second best. CLASSIC'S OMEGA
broke a bit awkwardly, advanced wide on the final turn with only a mild rally. SASSI ASPEN hustled to the front inside in the opening quarter then was
finished after half a mile. ACCEL JOE raced off the leaders three wide and never menaced. VEGAS DELETE dropped back along the inside and was
always outrun.

ONAMARGARITADAY alternated for the lead outside, took over near the quarter pole then pulled clear, ducked out in the final furlong but was not
threatened. PARKER EVA dueled winner along the inside, dropped back into the stretch but continued gamely. TYPO stalked the dueling pacesetters inside
and lacked a solid rally. HAVE I EVER pursued the leaders three wide then came up empty in the stretch. NAVAGATIONALBEACON broke a step slowly
and dropped far behind throughout. LITTLE E chased very wide off the pace and gave way readily.
