Footnotes
IT'S INEVITABLE hopped at the start, tracked along the inside, then pressed the pace two wide, bid on the far turn, led in upper stretch, dueled through the
final sixteenth and got the nod on the wire. SMOKING GUITAR raced three wide on the first turn, stalked four wide, rallied four wide into the stretch, drifted
in bothering rivals at the eighth pole, then rallied on the rail, dueled to the wire and just missed. LILLY BELLE stalked three wide on the backside, chased
inside on the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, steadied behind a rival at the furlong marker, altered course outside, rallied and dug in gamely to the
finish. FAVORITE SISTER raced off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, was steadied and bumped at the sixteenth pole, then continued on the rail.
HEIGHTEN pulled in the early stages, rated the pace, dueled past the quarter pole, tired and bumped FAVORITE SISTER near the sixteenth marker. There
was a Stewards' Inquiry, along with Jockey Objections by the riders of LILLY BELLE and FAVORITE SISTER against the second place finisher, after which
SMOKING GUITAR was disqualified and placed last for interference in the stretch run.

Footnotes
OKIE UNION showed good early speed to set the pace, dueled with HEPUTTHEACEINRACE on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival and battled
back determinedly to prevail after a long stretch drive. HEPUTTHEACEINRACE stalked close up early, bid two wide, dueled with OKIE UNION on the far
turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, battled it out with that rival in the final furlong and dug in gamely outside to the finish. MONSTER RIVER raced
three wide early, then tracked inside, lacked a winning bid, raced evenly in the stretch and held on for third. VALENTINE GUY raced off the pace, chased
the leaders on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and gained mildly outside. HUNTER'S LEGACY raced four wide early, then stalked two wide and
tired. SOONER SKUTA raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. OKLAHOMA LINE raced off the pace inside, moved up
at the quarter pole, then lacked a rally. WOODS OF CONGAREE raced off the pace and did not factor. ACTING WIZARD was pulled up on the backside
and vanned off.
