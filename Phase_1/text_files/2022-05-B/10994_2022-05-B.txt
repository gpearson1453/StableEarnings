outside with a narrow lead, lost the advantage in the stretch but continued willingly. WHERESTHEPASSION dropped well behind, began advancing on the
turn and finished with some late energy. REFUND RIGLER raced in closest pursuit of the dueling leaders then faded. PEACE CRUSADER chased far
behind, was carried out into the far turn and outrun. ALIGNMENT lacked speed, bore out on the turn and gave way. SCAMP WALKER trailed far behind
throughout.

BURN AND TURN dueled outside, led on the turn and held on gamely to the finish in a determined score CALL FITZROY rallied outside on the turn, loomed
a threat but could not get by. WHAT'S TO BLAME prompted the pace along the inside and weakened slightly in the stretch. POLITICAL steadied behind the
fallen rider into the far turn and raced wide. WEEKEND IN COURT far back early, steadied to avoid fallen rider into the far turn. GOLDENLINEOF dropped
back outside, moved closer on the turn then faded. ADMIRAL EASTWOOD bobbled between rivals and unseated his rider into the far turn. Following a
