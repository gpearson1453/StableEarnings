NOG hustled clear to the backside would move off on pace to the far turn, engaged nearing the quarter pole would cede to widest foe while hanging tough
late to salvage place. MILLIE stalked the pace pressing in bid on the far turn, overpowered from the outside down the lane was outdueled for place by hard
used rival. MY WYNTER ECHO off slowly lagged to upper stretch remaining no factor there. UNIQUE GIRL raced second flight tiring to upper stretch.
