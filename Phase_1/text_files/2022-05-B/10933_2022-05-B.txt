LOFTY ADJUDICATOR quickly to the front, collard stretch, responded to go clear with a good effort. EYES OF GLORY broke sharp outside, chased to
stretch, garnered a short lead at the eighth pole but could contain the winner and was outgamed late. RUBINSTEIN tried hard to keep up throughout, settled
for show spot no match. CALDINHO raced far back to the stretch, rallied outside to improved late. THEJIGISUP off rail run to turn, switched inside for
stretch run, weakened. SHERLOCKED rushed inside, tried to keep up but emptied out through the turn. CHIEF MYSTIQUE between horses to the turn,
could not keep up, stopped. TRUST FUND ROBBER very unruly behind gate, always outrun.
