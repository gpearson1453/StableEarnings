LET MY PEOPLE GO stalked the pace early, raced in the three path along the turn, was in the four path into the lane, edged past the leader near the eighth
pole, inched clear near the sixteenths pole and held in the final stages. RUM 'N TONIC tracked the pace early, raced on the inside through the turn, was
altered out nearing the eighth pole, rallied and was gaining in the final stages. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN set the pace early, was in the two path into the lane
and yielded late in the stretch run. GUEST SPEAKER was a beat slow at the start, chased the pace early, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the
five path into the lane, made a bid down the lane but flattened out late in the drive. EMBRACE raced back early on, was in the five path into the lane and
moved up late in the stretch drive. TRUE JEDI stalked the pace early, raced in the two path along the turn, was in the three path into the lane and weakened
late in the stretch. SILVER BLUR was a beat slow at the start, raced in the four path along the turn, was in the seven path into the lane and improved
position down the lane. MY GRASS IS BLUE raced on the inside along the turn, shifted into the two path entering the lane while never a threat. DIVISION
STREET was in tight a bit at the start and never a factor. NINJA WARRIOR raced a bit rank early on and was widest down the lane. HONORABLE VOW
was bumped and bothered at the start. DISCO was bumped at the start and through after a half.

DAVID'S GEM vied for the lead two wide, drove clear in the four path in upper stretch, and safely held sway. SEAU hopped while breaking slowly, saved
ground in midpack, slipped inside of foes in upper stretch, rallied along the rail while chasing a clear DAVID'S GEM in midstretch, and was second best.
IRISH HOKIE laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the seven path in upper stretch, and rallied outside of rivals to reach show late. FUTILE missed
the break, lagged well behind the field around the turn, cut the gap entering the lane, rallied inside of rivals in upper stretch, and stayed on. MY MAN
FLINTSTONE stalked the leading pair from the three path, spun into the lane in the five path while remaining outside of the leader, but lacked a kick to
produce a bid, and tired. MASON A. P. got caught in the four path while off of the pace, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and made little impact.
SILVER MOON ROAD rushed after a flat-footed beginning, vied along the inside of the eventual winner, but weakened two wide in upper stretch. CHARGE
THE LINE tracked in midpack two wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a rally, and faded.

TANGO CHARLIE settled at the rear along the inside, took the turn in the three to four path before swinging five wide entering the lane, rallied outside of
foes to bid at the furlong grounds, dueled with an inner SPEND BENJAMINS through the late stages, and prevailed in an extremely tight photo. SPEND
BENJAMINS stalked two wide and from the three path while outside of the top pair, spun into the lane four wide, grinded away between horses as an outer
TANGO CHARLIE rallied alongside, bid for the lead along with that rival entering the final furlong, dueled gamely through the late stages, but lost the nod at
the wire. FLAGS UP chased along the inside, vied for place inside of rivals while shifting off of the rail passing the quarter pole, but was outkicked by outer
foes in midstretch, and kept on to secure show. DARK TIMBER dueled for the lead inside of a rival, shook free of that foe at the quarter pole, but met a trio
of bidders at the furlong grounds, and faltered. YES SIR ROBERT dueled for the lead two wide, but weakened between horses at the quarter pole.
OFFICIAL BUSINESS broke a step slowly, trailed in the four path around the turn, and was outrun.

Footnotes
KUCHAR pressed outside of the leader, stalked that foe around the first turn, inched closer around the far turn, assumed command at the five sixteenths
pole, drew clear entering the lane, and held sway from chasing rivals thereafter. JARREAU bobbled a bit before being bumped inwardly by an outer rival
tracked from the three path, pursued three to four wide around the far turn, chased the clear leader through upper stretch, vied for place between horses at
the sixteenth pole, and held that position. BAKWENA came in and bumped a foe at the start, trailed two wide, then five wide around the far turn, and stayed
on well outside of rivals through the final furlong to claim show. WIN WORTHY broke a step slowly at the start, but avoided being pinched between horses
by doing so, laid off of the pace along the inside, moved forward quickly two wide and between horses around the far turn to loom a danger behind the
leader approaching the five sixteenths pole, chased that clearing rival from the outside entering the lane, but failed to progress in upper stretch, and yielded
place to a pair of outer rivals in the final furlong. EL AHIJADO broke a bit outwardly and brushed a rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but was
outmoved by outer foes around the far turn, trailed entering the lane, and made little impact. COMMON BOND tugged clear into the first turn, but offered
little resistance to KUCHAR's bid approaching the five sixteenths pole, and weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
KUNSHAN BRIDGE took back among foes early on, trailed the field in the four path around the turn, swung eight wide entering the lane, rallied in the final
furlong to bid along with an inner LUCKY DEVIL in the final sixteenth, and prevailed at the wire. LUCKY DEVIL laid off of the pace four wide, shifted seven
wide entering the lane, rallied in midstretch to bid entering the final sixteenth, led shortly after, but was nailed at the wire. GOLDEN LUNA stalked three
wide, loomed large turning for home, led passing the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch, but was outkicked by a pair of outer foes in the final
sixteenth. SUPREMELY laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses around the turn, shifted out while encountering traffic six wide entering the
lane, and stayed on therafter. FAST FELIX saved ground far back, improved along the rail passing the quarter pole, awaited racing room before tipping two
wide in midstretch, and chased the leaders home. SMARTY JOHN stalked along the inside, slipped inside of the early pace-setter passing the quarter pole,
chased the outer leader through midstretch, but faded late. PER DIEM laid off of the pace five to six wide, but failed to rally. ACEHIGH ROYAL tracked from
the two path, but lacked a rally between horses. THE JUDGE AND JURY set the pace, but was headed by an outer foe entering the lane before weakening
between horses. BLOW TORCH prompted the pace two wide, chased between horses turning for home, shifted outwardly entering the lane, and faltered
among rivals. OUR TEAM tracked four wide, but steadied entering the lane when BLOW TORCH shifted across his path, and faded soon after.
