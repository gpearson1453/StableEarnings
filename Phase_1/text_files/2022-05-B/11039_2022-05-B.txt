clear lead into the stretch and held on while drifting out a bit. EMMAS RULER was well off the early pace in the two path angled out for the stretch run was
gaining but could never get to the winner. MARCIAMARCIAMARCIA raced in the three path was in a bit of a tight spot down the backstretch came to the
inside at the top of the stretch then had to go back to the outside down the stretch in a good effort. SNEAK PEEK opted to go to the inside as SOCIAL
DATE raced off the rail. Engaged for the lead into the second turn to be on even terms but gave way midstretch. STACEYS RACEY was up close while four
wide then gave way quickly up the backstretch.NOTE: THE HORSES WERE ON THE TRACK FOR THIS RACE WHEN A STRONG THUNDERSTORM
MOVED INTO THE AREA. THE HORSES RETURNED TO THE PADDOCK AND THE RACE WAS CONTESTED AFTER ABOUT A 30 MINUTE DELAY.
THE RACE WAS SCHEDULED ON THE TURF AND AFTER THE DELAY WAS MOVED TO THE MAIN TRACK

final fifty yards. SERRANO'S WARRIOR broke best but could not get the rail and raced in the two path responded when challenged and did not give way
until the final fifty yards. RAISE THE PRAISE was bumped hard at the start and was well off the pace and the rail came to the inside for the stretch run and
was finishing very well. LITTLE JONY was always well off the rail was three wide on the turn and then four wide entering the stretch and could not make up
ground. COOL SPIRIT broke in bumped and still showed good early speed on the inside was in contention to the top of the stretch and then gave way.

FIRST EMPRESS was allowed to back out of the speed duel early then angled out up the backstretch and made a three wide bid on the turn on her own
had a good lead in the stretch and won under mild urging with plenty to spare. GIRL THIRSTY was along the inside then swung four wide entering the
stretch while closing ground drifted in through the lane and was no match for the winner. VARSITY FLYGIRL was quickest into the first turn held the inside
throughout while being pressed on the outside held tough when challenged and continued well after being overtaken but weakened late. MARY ALICE
showed good early speed to battle for the lead two deep held gamely to the top of the stretch and then gave way. BRIGHTEST raced three to four wide in
the early stages and then dropped back and was not a factor.

through the stretch and was edging clear late. ADIOS CARLOS stalked the early pace while always in the two path engaged for the lead into the turn but
could never go by the winner. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. was prominent in the early stages dropped back some into the turn but came back for third while no
threat to the top two. MISTER DON raced three wide throughout and had nothing left in the stretch while dropping back.

SUPER WISE showed good early speed but was taken out of the duel into the first turn was allowed to settle in the two path then game three wide on the
second turn steadily wore down the leader and edged clear in the final yards. TROPHY DADDY showed the best early speed to get to the rail was
challenged from the outset had a clear lead turning for home and gave way grudgingly in the upper stretch. FREIGHTRAINFREEMAN was away well and
took a ground saving trip was full of run with nowhere to go up the backstretch and steadied briefly dropped back a bit and then stayed along the inside and
was up for third while no threat to the top two. IMMORTAL showed good early speed in the two path and was on the front end was asked for more on the
second turn and had little left in the tank and dropped back. LEFTY COMMING was three wide on the first turn and then up the backstretch but backed up
going into the second turn.

CITIZEN WEST was away in good order and able to save the two path while battling for the lead drifted out a bit midstretch but was quickly corrected and
edged clear through the lane while never seriously threatened. CLEAR HUMOR showed good early speed on the inside was in good position but could not
go by the winner while hanging tough for second along the rail. LONG AND STRONG made a three wide move on the turn to get into contention but could
not sustain the momentum and had to settle for third. PESO IN MY POCKET was quickest in the first few strides but could not get to the rail dropped back
between foes and raced evenly after that. SHANGHAI'S DREAM was three wide on the turn and never mounted a serious challenge through the stretch.
OXXON went to the back of the pack shortly after the start and never offered a rally.

RY DONT LIE was rank in the post parade and bumped at the start but was away alertly and challenged from the outset in the two path edged clear
entering the stretch and steadily increased the margin through the stretch to earn the victory. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF had the perfect ground saving trip for
the first half then came to the two path in the second turn to pass a tiring rival came through along the inside through the stretch but could not get to the
winner. KINGPRIN was away in good order but could not get to the rail in the first turn made a run three wide on the second turn but could not sustain that
bid and flattened out. ANYOTHERQUESTIONS showed good early speed and had the rail was challenged every step of the way and tired turning for home.
BODEE BODEE was midpack in the early stages but began a steady faded up the backstretch. BOUGIE MARIE was always in the back of the pack while
racing off the rail and was not a factor. EVERYDAYSCHRISTMAS wheeled and lost the rider in the post parade broke in and bumped at the start and was
always well back and never a factor.
