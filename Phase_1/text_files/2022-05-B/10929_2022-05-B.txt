Footnotes
TREASURE THE STORM well placed and inside, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for racing room and drove clear. RED LINGERIE
sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, increased her margin to the lane, then was no match for the winner in upper stretch, while clearly best of the
rest. SAMURAI SONG broke through the gate prior to the start, moved up three wide through the turn, bid on that path and ran evenly in the lane.
PRINCESS TINE (FR) broke sharply from the gate and was rated back in the early going, then could not gain. MIDNIGHT PIRATE was never involved.

the start, was allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, then had a mild gain inside through the stretch. MADE TO HUSTLE broke in at the start,
stalked the pace on the outside, bid three wide outside of that one and weakened in the lane. DOMINANT STRANGER pinched back at the start, moved up
four wide through the turn, then had no stretch rally.

K C ROCKET set the pace on the inside, shook clear and drew off through the turn, then held under steady pressure. GENERAL WINSTON loose in the
post parade, stalked the pace pulling, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on that path, then lacked the needed late kick, while edging back
up to the place spot. TRAVELLER 'broke out at the start, held position through the turn, came through inside into the stretch and flattened in the late going.
CHOCOLATE PHILLING allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, angled widest into the stretch and ran evenly. LIGHTNING
CHARLIE never far back, lost some ground two and three wide through the turn, then weakened further in the lane. CROWLEY'S WAR was no factor.
RUNAWAY RUSSELL well placed and outside early, faded through the turn.
