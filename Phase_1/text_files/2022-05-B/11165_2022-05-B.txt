Footnotes
WAPITI WAY allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out, closed fast and edged up in the
final strides. DETANGLER well placed and outside, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid on the two path into the lane, made a steady gain,
edged ahead late and was outfinished. SPICY SHOT tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and
lacked the needed late kick from between foes. EXPLOSIVE HUMOUR sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, drew off through the turn, then
weakened late and held a share. QUARTERMASTER allowed to settle, looped three wide through the turn and improved position in the lane.
BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS mid pack, came widest into the stretch and lost ground. PEANUTS PERFECTION stalked the pace on the outside, lost some ground
through the turn, then faded in the lane.
