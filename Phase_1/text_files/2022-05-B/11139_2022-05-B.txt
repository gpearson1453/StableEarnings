EYETINERARI broke in, drifted in early, kept leaning in most of the race under urging and kept on to the wire. SHY GUY away cleanly, shied early from
drifting in rival, asked right handed, had to deal with drifting in rival last half of the race and showed good courage to finish up a willing third. THAMES broke
in, showed good early speed, drifted in midway and shortened strides approaching the wire. AJ BORN RUNNIN bumped solidly at the start, lugged in and
bumped rival couple times passing the gap, lost path to lugging in rival midway, altered out and finished with a rush. HAY SHAKER broke in, shied in just a
touch passing the gap, asked right handed and failed to respond. FIRED UP FOR THIS 1 broke outward and bumped rival at the start, rival returned favor
and lugged in and bumped him passing the gap, floated in by same rival midway and never fully leveled in rough trip. MS TELLER JESS MRL came in two
paths at the start, hand ridden first half of race, asked right handed midway and lacked needed response along the rail.

ANOTHER NYMPH hard to load, scrambled a bit at the start, showed strong acceleration, cleared rivals midway, lugged in and stayed clear. DISRUPTOR
came in two paths at the start, steady urged and lugged in midway, in a solid effort. TELLER LEGACY MRL away cleanly, steady urged throughout, crossed
over by clear rival late and altered out. ANCIENT CORONA away cleanly, drifted in mildly, hand ridden to wire and just held fourth. CORONA CARTELS
away well, in contention early, shifted out three different times late to lose all chance at a top three placing. NOMAD TOO away cleanly, lugged out two
paths approaching the gap, hand ridden to the wire in a even effort. STELLA GIRL 47 away cleanly, impeded by lugging out rival, had to steady and alter in,
when in clear lacked response and weakened. CONSTITUTIONALIST off slow and lost path at the start, wrapped up and not asked to the wire.
