Footnotes
A DIME FOR ME took back leaving the break and stalked the solid fractions through the turn, advanced on the pacesetter in upper stretch while in hand,
took command into the final furlong and kicked clear in the end. TRAFFIC STOPPER was hustled leaving the break, set the solid pace through the turn
while being pressed by the winner, was overtaken in upper stretch but kept on in the late stages to hold for second. JAN JAN CAN was void of early speed,
gained ground on the turn, swung four wide into the drive, was put to firm urging through the stretch and was outkicked in the end but kept on to secure
third. ST. ANNIE'S INDY stalked the early pace to the turn, advanced while three wide nearing the top of the lane, was outrun in upper stretch and did not
offer a late rally. GEE STREET lacked speed to the turn, improved while two wide nearing the quarter marker but did not have a late response. GOOD TIME
DOLLY chased the early pace from the inside, bobbled leaving the three furlong marker, was not persevered with through the turn, was eased in the stretch
and walked off under her own power.

Footnotes
LEIGH ANN was four wide into the first turn then took back to stalk the pace, gained ground on the second turn, was roused three wide into the drive,
overtook ROSEBUD RYDE in upper stretch and drew away in the final stages. ROSEBUD RYDE was up close in the early stages, ceded the early pace
along the first turn, mounted a two wide bid on the second turn and established a clear lead nearing the quarter marker, was overtaken by the winner in
upper stretch and outfinished, while just holding for second. FILLY PELLI was in tight nearing the first turn, was squeezed and clipped heels into the turn,
recovered well to settle off of the pace, improved position while two wide on the second turn, rallied in upper stretch, was outkicked in the final stages but
just missed for second while clear for third. CHELINA settled off of the early pace, improved position on the second turn while four wide, could not sustain
that bid in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. STORMY SIERRA was fractious in the starting gate, stalked the early pace while three wide on
the first turn, advanced on the backstretch run, maintained position while three wide through the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way in
the end. CLIPPERVILE GIRL drifted in nearing the first turn and squeezed FILLY PELLI, was keen along the first turn and disputed the early pace, went on
to set the fractions through the half-mile marker, lost position on the second turn and faded in the drive. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE INCIDENT APPROACHING THE FIRST TURN INVOLVING FILLY PELLI CLIPPING HEELS AND IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION RULED THAT
THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE OFFICIAL ORDER.

Footnotes
KITTY'S CANDY was between horses as part of the pace-setting group early, was outrun into the turn, moved through a hole created when HOT
RAGEOUS drifted out slightly, overtook HOT RAGEOUS into the final furlong and edged clear in the end. CANAM GAL was off a step slow and quickly
found herself well behind the leading trio, advanced two to three wide on the turn, swung four wide into the stretch and steadily gained for the place. HOT
RAGEOUS broke the best and was determined to gain a forward position, found herself inside of two other rivals down the backside, easily fended off a
challenge from TIGER QUEEN, responded when asked and took a clear lead in the run for home but was caught and unable to sustain the bid in the final
furlong. TIGER QUEEN broke out at the start, was hustled for the lead and was outside of a three-horse speed duel for the first quarter, drifted out a path
nearing the top of the lane, briefly challenged HOT RAGEOUS for the lead entering the stretch and weakened in the late going.

PASSARANDO was away alertly, took back off of the early pace and stalked the fractions while three deep to the quarter marker, advanced in upper
stretch, put away the runner-up leaving the furlong grounds and drew away in the end. GALLIVANTER showed good early speed and disputed the pace,
kept pressure on the pacesetter through the turn, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished, while just holding for second.
MOTHER'S PRAYER chased the pace to the turn, gained ground while four wide nearing the quarter marker, was outkicked in the drive but just missed for
second in the end. MONEY MUNCHER steadied in tight in the early stages, was green and hard to place into the turn, chased from the inside through the
turn and lacked a late rally. CARDINAL TRICK was forwardly placed while contesting the early pace to the turn, was green and drifted out into the turn, set
the disputed pace to the quarter marker, was overtaken in upper stretch and gave way in the final stages. GOOD DANNY was outrun in the early stages,
saved ground into the stretch drive and was not a threat. SMOKEM O'NEIL did not show early speed, came three wide along the turn and was not a factor.
HOT JOURNEY lacked early speed, was outrun through the turn and did not offer a late response.

ROBIE was sent leaving the break and took command of the early pace duties, opened to a clear lead along the backstretch run, quickened when
confronted nearing the quarter marker, was confronted in midstretch by the runner-up but repelled that bid and held sway in the end. SKY DINSKI settled in
the midflight, saved all of the ground to the second turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker, rallied in the stretch along the inside, challenged
ROBIE leaving the furlong marker but was repelled in that effort and was outfinished, while besting the rest. UNION WAVE was four wide on the first turn
while stalking the early pace, advanced on the second turn to confront ROBIE, was turned away in that bid and was outkicked in upper stretch but held for
third in the end. LIL MIRACLE MAN contested the early pace then took back to stalk the moderate pace from a three wide path, lost ground on the second
turn and weakened in the final stages. MOUNT PELLIAR stumbled at the start and was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through
the second turn and lacked a late rally. GOOD BYE PUTIN settled off of the early pace, maintained a three wide path into the second turn and did not offer a
late response.

AS AMATTER OF FACT broke out at the start and bumped WINTER FALCON leaving the break, chased the early pace to the turn, advanced while three
deep nearing the quarter pole, continued that run in upper stretch, took a narrow lead leaving the eighth pole and kicked clear in the end. BIG PAPA STEVE
was bumped at the start and was a bit slow into stride early on, improved position on the turn, swung widest to go seven wide at the top of the stretch, made
a bold late rally and could not reel in the winner in the end but was up in time to secure the place. NORTHVALE ROAD chased the quick pace from the
second flight, gained ground while three then four wide on the turn, continued that advance in upper stretch to vie for the lead nearing the furlong marker but
was outfinished in the final stages and was clear of the rest for the show. ARTEMUS GORDON was sandwiched at the start and was away slowly, shifted to
the inside nearing the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker, angled out leaving the turn to be six wide at the top of the lane, continued to rally
in upper stretch and showed good late interest while unable to make an impact on the top three. WINTER FALCON was bumped at the start, recovered to
chase the quick pace from midflight, advanced while two wide on the turn, continued that bid into the stretch run but faltered in the final stages. FRANKLIN
ONE STAR was a bit fractious in the gate, was sent leaving the break and set quick fractions while being pressed through the turn, was collared
approaching the furlong grounds and gave way in the late going. BANDERA AZTECA was forwardly placed early on while saving ground, lost position on
the turn, came back on in upper stretch but could not sustain that bid and weakened in the drive. STANFORD BAY broke alertly and pressed the quick pace
to the turn, maintained that pressing trip to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired in the late stages. OUR EMPIRE chased the early pace
to the turn, dropped back along the turn while three wide, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the final stages and walked off under his own power.
THE TRAINER OF #4 WINTER FALCON LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST #3 AS A MATTER OF FACT AND #6 BIG PAPA STEVE FOR THE
INCIDENTS AT THE START AND THE STEWARDS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE OFFICIAL ORDER OF
FINISH STEMMING FROM THOSE INCIDENTS.

Footnotes
BELLAMORE settled just off of the early pace while in the midflight, was roused while three wide nearing the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch,
was bumped by MUSIC FESTIVAL leaving the furlong marker, was put to firm left-handed urging through the lane, lugged out from that handling nearing the
sixteenth-marker causing ASSIGNATION to alter course, dug in in the final strides and held to prevail. NATURAL COLOUR (GB) was up close in the early
stages while under a snug hold, saved ground into the second turn, advanced nearing the quarter pole, tipped out leaving the eighth pole, surged in the final
stages and could not catch the winner but was up for second. ASSIGNATION settled off of the early pace while saving ground, advanced on the second turn
while three wide, came within aim nearing the furlong grounds, altered course and was bothered when BELLAMORE lugged out inside of the sixteenth
marker and could not reel in the top pair but was up in time for third. MUSIC FESTIVAL attended to the moderate pace, advanced on the pacesetter along
the second turn, dueled with EMPIRE HOUSE to the eighth pole, drifted out and bothered BELLAMORE leaving the furlong marker and was outkicked in the
late stages. REIWA was allowed to settle while maintaining a two wide path early on, was roused along the second turn, swung widest into the drive to be
five wide at the three-sixteenths marker, closed well in midstretch, altered course when ASSIGNATION came out inside of the sixteenth marker and was
outfinished in the final stages. EMPIRE HOUSE was sent leaving the start and set the moderate pace through the half-mile marker, was confronted nearing
the quarter marker, dueled with MUSIC FESTIVAL to the furlong grounds, could not keep up in the late stages and weakened in the final sixteenth.
SCHERZO (GB) was away a bit slowly and was rank leaving the chute, was unhurried in the early stages while three wide, was steered to the two path
along the second turn and did not mount a late rally. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED TWO INQUIRIES INTO THE RUNNING IN THE STRETCH. IN THE
FIRST INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT MUSIC FESTIVAL IMPEDED BELLAMORE LEAVING THE EIGHTH POLE AND
WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FOURTH AND PLACED FIFTH. IN THE SECOND INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS RULED UNANIMOUSLY THAT
BELLAMORE DRIFTED OUT INSIDE OF THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND IMPEDED ASSIGNATION WHO IN TURN IMPEDED REIWA AND THAT
BELLAMORE WOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED FOURTH.

Footnotes
ROISTER first out at the start, settled into a stalking position behind dueling leaders, bid to challenge three wide with PROOF OF REALITY to his outside,
engaged, then disposed of that rival by the furlong marker and won clear in a driving finish. MY LITTLE TAYLOR unhurried early, angled from the outside to
the two-path to to save ground, was asked to pick it up after passing the half, swung six-wide into the stretch and continued a sustained run to just get up for
second. THUNDER OF ZION used the length of the backstretch run to save ground into the turn, moved to challenge on the final turn while widest of all,
finished well, just missing the place by a nose. PROOF OF REALITY broke well, settled into stride mid-pack four-wide down the backstretch, made a bold
move to the lead approaching the quarter pole, engaging with ROISTER for a furlong but could not keep up and was passed late. TOO TALL TO CALL
quick into stride, settled to the outside of THE CHIEFHASTRICKS, appeared to be comfortable with the pace, took a brief lead past the quarter pole but was
unable to quicken when challenged and faded. FRISCO KID broke in bumping MR. WILLPOWER, then the two came together again a few strides later,
after the trouble secured a nice position in the two path, made a mid-race move towards the leading pair into contention into the turn while gaining the rail
path, had to wait for room entering the stretch but lacked a finishing kick when needed. THECHIEFHASTRICKS broke sharply, hustled to the front and was
engaged immediately by TOO TALL TO CALL, dueled with that one to the half and gave way readily when encountering a host of challengers turning for
home. MR. WILLPOWER was bumped hard by FRISCO KID just after the start the steadied as the two came together a second time, eventually found a
clear path on the rail and advanced steadily into a contending position until having to check when FRISCO KID again took his path entering the turn, swung
wide when clear but had little to offer in the end. PLAYER OPTION broke out slightly at the break, overcorrected to the left then was subsequently bumped
and forced to steady when FRISCO KID, attempting to correct his own errant start, veered into his path, then made his way to the rail to save ground while
at the rear and never advanced his position from there while being outrun.
