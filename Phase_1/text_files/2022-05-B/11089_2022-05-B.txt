Footnotes
EMPHASIZE , taken five wide soon after the break and settled off a a three pronged pace skirmish, edged up five wide heading to the half mile marker,
came in some brushing a rival when bidding outside foes around the far turn, dueled three deep past the five sixteenths, shook clear nearing mid stretch
then held sway under a drive. DASHING CIRCLES , away alertly, disputed the pace inside rivals from the start, dug in when headed past the three eighths,
fought on to the inside of the winner entering the lane, saw that one go clear nearing the eighth pole then continued on valiantly to cut back into the margin.
I'M NOT SLOW , with the pace three deep and under some rating, was brushed and put in tight around the far turn, regrouped, shifted to pursue into the
lane and churned on with interest. ROCKIN RON got into a pace scrum while between runners soon after the break, was under pressure to hold position
leaving the five eighths, failed to go on with the leaders in upper stretch, kept on with effort to mid stretch then faded. MANKLIN CREEK dropped in early
and failed to respond. GREYLOVER tracked the dueling trio while three to four wide, moved up near the half mile marker, was brushed and put in close
leaving the far turn and gave way.

setting the pace towards the rail, opened up after being set down in upper stretch, drifted out a bit and held firm while kept to a solid drive. SWEET TALIA ,
taken to rate off the early leaders, moved up while saving ground into the lane, eased out to pursue, kept on gamely to steadily gain and out kicked a rival
for the place. MICK'SBESTBETYET , three wide between runners while forcing the pace, gave hard pursuit into the lane, was floated out a bit past mid
stretch and stayed on well. MARKET OF STOCKS drifted out at the break, corrected and drafted back off the pace, raced three to four wide into the lane,
advanced between runners past mid stretch, angled out and churned on. ICY REPLY , four wide outside rivals, raced within range past the five sixteenths,
failed to kick on in upper stretch, drifted out some nearing mid stretch and gave way. MO FIRE , two wide inside foes, raced close up into the lane, lacked a
punch past the three sixteenths then retreated.

DIVINE PROPORTION lacked speed, raced inside horses in upper stretch, moved out a bit approaching the eighth pole, split horses inside the eighth pole
and eagerly drew away. CAIRO BOOGIE , well back early, began his rally inside rivals in upper stretch, moved over approaching the eighth pole and rallied
between foes. PIT STOP MAN , shuffled back mid way down the backstretch, eased out to the three path leaving the turn, moved up outside horses in
upper stretch, flattened out and his rider dropped his whip near the sixteenth pole. SCORCHED BY FIRE , swung to the four path approaching the stretch,
weakened through the lane. ABHAR set a pressured pace along the inner rail and weakened. BALTIMORE BUD prompted the pace outside ABHAR and
tired in upper stretch. BOLD TREK , along the inner rail on the turn, was outrun.

COMMANDING GENERAL broke on top and was hustled to the front, handled some outside pressure then dropped in when clearing around the turn,
opened up under solid handling past mid stretch and was kept to task. ALL THREES tracked early off the rail then steadied when squeezed back entering
the turn, regrouped past the three eighths, circled four to five wide into the lane and closed willingly to earn the place. ZEN PI , urged from the gate, chased
the pace while saving ground, eased out near mid stretch and kept on with interest between runners. HELLO AMIGO , off the pace two to three wide, swung
out in upper stretch and had belated action. RAD PAISLEY , hard sent from the gate, forced the issue three then two wide outside the winner, failed to kick
on past the furlong grounds and faded inside foes. CYNERGY'S STAR moved up four wide into the turn, pursued three wide past the quarter pole, stayed
willingly past the furlong grounds then weakened very late.

Footnotes
JIMMY THE KID drifted out at the break, corrected and had his rider toss the lead strap soon after, relaxed three wide in a tracking position, took closer
order approaching the stretch, closed in under left handed asking and joined THE CAIRO KID inside the furlong grounds, dueled, took command late then
edged clear in the final yards. THE CAIRO KID quickly went clear, set the pace towards the inside, dug in when collared past mid stretch, battled inside the
winner leaving the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. ALBERTANO came out at the break tightening a rival, straightened and dropped well off the
early pace, saved ground into the lane, moved up past mid stretch, angled out, rallied between foes and just earned the show to the inside of RISING
PERRY. RISING PERRY chased two wide outside a rival, shifted out four wide for the drive, moved up a bit past the furlong grounds, flattened out late
under some mild hand urging and was nailed for the show. SNOW CANDY , in tight at the break, raced off the pace and off the inside, angled five wide for
the drive, made some progress to the sixteenth marker then failed to sustain. EL ZOPILOTE saved ground chasing the pace, eased out and faded.
