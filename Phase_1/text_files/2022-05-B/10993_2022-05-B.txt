Footnotes
TONED UP tracked along the inside, bid two wide entering the far turn, dueled with MADAME ROUGE on the turn, battled with that rival passing the furlong
marker, took over near the sixteenth pole and drew clear for the win. MADAME ROUGE raced three wide early, cleared off to set the pace, dueled with the
winner on the far turn, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch run and came up second best. TIC TIC TIC BOOM raced off the pace inside, moved
up three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly and failed to threaten the top pair. EMPIRES FIRST LADY raced off the pace
between rivals, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally. JEAN V'S LEGACY stalked two wide, chased on the far turn and faded. SIP'N DIP was off
slowly, raced three wide off the pace and did not factor.

Footnotes
BIRD RULER stalked close up three wide, moved up on the far turn, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, took over and drew clear under urging. LET
FREEDOM SPRING raced off the rail, off pace, moved three wide on the far turn, bid three wide at the quarter pole, rallied outside and came up second
best. TOUCH OF A BUZZ raced four wide early, continued four wide off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and finished evenly.
MERICATHEBEAUTIFUL was outrun early, advanced on the far turn, angled out and gained mildly. PLUNK tracked on the inside, moved up three or four
wide on the far turn and lacked a rally. BENNY'S FIDDLE was bumped at the start, had the rider lost the irons and never recover, regardless, set the pace,
showed the way to the quarter pole and then gave way. OUTSTANDING ISLAND was fractious loading and briefly ran off with the rider, returned to load and
was a bit fractious again, then raced three wide early, between rivals and gave way. CLASSIC ESCAPE was bumped at the start, raced off the pace inside
and did not factor.
