WE'RE IN COMMAND away alertly and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, set sail after the leader two wide entering
the final turn, collared that foe leaving the turn, and prevailed over that stubborn rival following a stretch long battle to prove best. AIRAFFAIR broke sharply
and raced to the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, controlled the pace in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, battled for the lead
from the inside of WE'RE IN COMMAND leaving the turn, and just failed to last. THE VALENTINE KID unhurried early while dropping back to trail, raced
three wide into the backstretch, dropped to the inside to commence his bid entering the final turn, and closed willingly one out from the rail in the drive to get
up for a share. CAUSIN' HAVOC stalked the leader in the run down the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, rallied from along the inside entering the
final turn, but came up empty in the lane, while drifting five wide through the lane. EYE BE SEEING YOU stalked the leaders while racing three wide in the
run down the backstretch, rallied two out from the rail through the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called upon, and was carried six
wide in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
ACE DEUCE tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing one out from the rail, maintained his position into the backstretch, tipped three
wide to launch his bid entering the final turn, quickly assumed command midway through the turn, and drew clear in the lane under confident handling while
being ridden out late as much the best. MUSTACHIO broke sharply and dueled for the lead from the outside of YOU DON'T OWN ME entering the first turn,
continued to force the issue from the outside of that rival in the run down the backstretch and into the final turn, was no match when tackled by ACE DEUCE
midway through the turn, but continued on valiantly through the lane to prove clearly second best. YOU DON'T OWN ME sent from along the rail to vie for
the lead entering the first turn, set a pressured pace through the second turn and in the run down the backstretch, was quickly overtaken soon after entering
the final turn, and was outfinished late while holding on for a share. TRUPON ONLINE tracked the leaders into the stretch the first time while racing well out
from the rail, continued with a wide trip in the run down the backstretch, raced three wide through the final turn, and was only able to pass a tiring rival late.
DAKATI unhurried early while easing to the back of the back and angling towards the rail entering the stretch the first time, began to advance from along the
rail midway down the backside, rallied from along the rail entering the final turn, but faded late while unable to ,ount a serious bid over the final furlong.

VISENYA tracked the dueling leaders in the run down the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied along the rail entering the final turn,
tipped off the rail entering the lane, and closed steadily two wide in the drive to get up in time. KOALA broke sharply and vied for the lead from along the rail
entering the backstretch, set a pressured pace in the run down the backside and into the final turn, got the better of her pace rival leaving the turn, but was
unable to fend off the late bid by VISENYA, and just held the place. GWEN away well and dueled for the lead from the outside of KOALA in the run down
the backstretch and into the final turn, was unable to keep tabs on that rival leaving the turn, but but back three wide in the drive to just miss the place.
HARBOUR STORM away alertly and stalked the leaders into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, rallied two wide through the final turn, and
finished evenly from along the rail in the drive. SILVER ARROW settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backside, began to
advance midway down the backside, but failed to make a serious impact while finishing three wide in the drive. SUNBURNT lagged well back early while
racing four wide entering the backstretch, rallied with interest one out from the rail entering the final turn, but failed to make a serious late impact. CLASSY
LEGACY settled well off the early pacesetters while racing two out from the rail, began to drop back approaching the final turn, and had nothing to offer late.
BORROW lagged well back in the run to the backstretch while saving ground at the rail, was always well back and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
WISE MARKET settled off the early pace while racing two out from the rail in the run down the backstretch, commenced his bid four out from the rail
entering the final turn, and closed determinedly four wide through the lane to get the nod over a stubborn TIZ MEOW. TIZ MEOW stalked the leaders into
the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied four wide through the final turn to collar the leader entering the lane, and just failed to last while
finishing one out from the rail in the drive. APPELLANT settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail entering the backstretch, began to
advance midway down the backstretch, rallied smartly three wide through the final turn, and finished two out from the rail from between rivals in deep stretch
to garner a share. SANAWAR away alertly and tracked the dueling leaders into the backstretch while saving ground along the inside, rallied smartly two
wide through the final turn, while awaiting racing room, and finished two out from the rail in the drive while unable to fine a clear path entering the lane.
REPRIMAND away well and dueled for the lead from between rivals in the run down the backside, rallied two wide through the final turn, but was outfinished
late while finishing from along the inside in the drive. TEXAS KID missed the break to get away poorly, settled well off the early leaders while saving ground
at the rail in the run down the backstretch, raced two wide into the final turn, but failed to make a late impact. THE CHANCES R broke sharply and vied for
the lead from along the rail entering the first turn, set a pressured pace from along the rail in the run down the backstretch, began to give way entering the
final turn, and had nothing to offer over the final furlong. IT'S IN COMMAND pressed the leaders three wide in the run down the backside, assumed
command while continuing three wide into the final turn, but stopped badly in the lane.

HANKY PRANKY stalked the leader from along the rail in the run down the backside, rallied smartly from along the rail entering the final turn, inherited a
clear advantage when MONTE bore out through the turn, and widened his advantage through the lane under confident handling. DR. BENNY settled well off
the early pace while racing two out from the rail entering the backstretch, rallied three wide through the final turn, and continued two out from the rail in the
stretch drive to gain the place in the late going. SLOOP JOHN B settled off the early pace while saving ground at the rail in the run down the backside,
rallied along the inside through the final turn, and closed willingly from along the rail in the drive to just miss the place. Y VEE R away alertly and stalked the
pacesetter into the backstretch while racing two out from the rail, rallied three wide into the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response when called
upon. MONTE broke sharply and raced to an uncontested lead from just off the rail entering the backstretch, bore out entering the final turn, and finished
from the middle of the track in the lane while dropping back. MT SEYMOUR settled off the early pace while racing one out from the rail in the run down the
backstretch, rallied three wide entering the final turn, but lacked the needed closing response late while finishing two wide in the drive. TRAPALIS was slow
into stride while dropping well behind the rest of the field entering the backstretch, was always well back and failed to mak a serious impact. THREE DAY
BENDER away well and tracked the leader into the backstretch while racing one out from the rail, chased the pacesetter to the final turn, before weakening.
