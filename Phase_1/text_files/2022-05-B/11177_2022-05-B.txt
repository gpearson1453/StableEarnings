on the turn then faltered. ISSUING JUSTICE ducked out just after the start bumping the winner then weakened after the half. KANE raced far behind
throughout and was never a factor.

STILL ALIVE set the pace inside under rating, moved clear quarter pole then drew away through the stretch while being shown the whip late. TERPEYE
trailed far behind early, advanced into the stretch then split foes closing with good energy. WALK ME HOME forced the pace between rivals to the stretch
and flattened out. TWIRLING WIND stumbled while breaking alertly, chased outside and lacked a bid. SEAMIALAUGH prompted the pace three wide to the
quarter pole and faltered. LIL TATER dropped far behind down the backstretch and was never in contention. CAWAJA TIME eased back opening in the
quarter, chased inside and gave way.

MUSK allowed to settle, advanced on the turn, swung wide into the stretch, offered a late surge and moved clear late. VERRAZANO BRIDGE raced close
up inside, faded a bit on the turn then came again along the rail. DONT BREAK THE LAW broke very slowly, raced far behind then closed strongly too late.
INDOCTRINATE set a pressured pace off the inside, bid clear briefly in the stretch then yielded. CATTY'S UNCLE prompted the pace outside, steadied
briefly in deep stretch while weakening slightly. TEQUILA JR dropped back early and was never a factor. RUNAWAY STAR was urged close up four wide to
the far turn and gave way. DIABLO D ORO dropped back after the start and was always outrun.

O'BRIEN settled well behind inside, angled out rallying in the stretch and was up final stride. SAKETUMI controlled the pace, widened in midstretch but was
nailed. C C GOLDRUSH crowded after the start, raced far back inside then closed well. VICTORY ANTHEM raced just off the leaders inside then flattened
out in the stretch. GO LIME raced far behind outside and was never a factor. DECLARATION TIME ducked out at start, pursued the pacesetter and faded
on the final turn. DEPLANE lacked speed in the three path and lacked a rally. SWATH crowded after the start, saved ground and was no factor. HOTPOT
was soundly bumped at the start then gave way losing contact with his field. THE GREAT GAZOO and FICTIONALFAIRYTALE ran off on the way to the
paddock and were ordered late scratches.

BLUE PAYNT stalked the pace three wide, bid at the quarter pole, edged clear in midstretch and just lasted. CLOUT CHASER raced in closest pursuit of the
pacesetter, steadied between rivals at the top of the stretch then came again missing the head bob. TOMARIE dropped far behind outside then closed the
gap through the stretch. AEGEAN SEA set a clear pace along the inside, resisted when challenged then tired. TILSA broke sluggishly and lacked a rally.
ADHWAA chased between rivals and gave way on the final turn. LEAN ON E saved ground close up and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the runner-up
against the winner for interference in the stretch was dismissed.

through traffic and closed strongly too late. MONSTER RISING underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, saved ground, bid in the stretch, loomed a threat
but tired. PAGEANT PRINCESS dropped far behind then advanced inside through the stretch. BRAVO REGINA far behind early, moved closer in the two
path then flattened out. MIA TOSCA rated off the leaders, moved extremely wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. MOONCHILD stalked the
pacesetters three wide to the final turn and weakened. SALLY'S MUSTANG reserved close up inside to the three eighths pole and faded. PERFECT
DIRECTION quickly sprinted clear for three quarters then stopped in the stretch. LET'S CELEBRATE pursued the loose pacesetter for three quarters and
gave way. ENGLISH CHARMER raced wide in midpack and faltered after half a mile.
