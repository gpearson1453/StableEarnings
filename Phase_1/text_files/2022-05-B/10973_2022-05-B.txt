Footnotes
MAGOO angled inwards dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, edged forward into upper stretch and just held QUANTUM LEAP
under firm right handed pressure. The latter, in touch prompting the pace from the outset to the far turn, lost ground to the winner in upper stretch but was
coming back late to just miss. CARL G, forwardly placed three wide stalking just off the leaders to the far turn, weakened in the drive. ALLEN settled last to
the backstretch and never gained contention. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM tracked off the first flight along the inside to the backstretch and faded after a half. O
DOGG tracked the pace between foes off the first flight to the far turn and emptied out racing into the stretch.

BUGLER, prominent four wide in the opening stages, pressed the pace in that path into the turn, then continued to duel between foes into upper stretch and
narrowly prevailed under firm handling. MARTINI BLU was rated off the first flight along the inside in the opening quarter, tipped outside foes gaining
position on the turn, angled to the five path in upper stretch to challenge for command racing past the furlong marker but was outkicked. EXXEL, urged
between foes disputing the pace on a narrow advantage, dueled for command inside rivals into upper stretch but weakened nearing the wire. CITRUS BAY
vied briefly with the leaders three wide between foes but faded nearing the lane. LESLIE'S GOLD, urged inside rivals disputing the pace in the opening
quarter, gave way early.

BUDRO TALKING was settled last along the inside to the backstretch, switched outside foes commencing a steady advance on the far turn, angled four
wide in upper stretch and surged to edge FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM in time under firm handling. The latter, forwardly placed stalking just off the pacesetter
in the opening half, advanced to wrest the advantage on the far turn, went clear into upper stretch but was collared at the wire. JAILHOUSE KITTEN, off
slowly, settled outside the eventual winner racing to the first turn, gained contention outside a rival racing into the far turn, tipped out three wide in upper
stretch and continued willingly between foes. UNBROKEN SONG tracked just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn and faded into upper stretch.
ASTRONOMICAL sped to the lead leaving the chute, dictated the pace on a clear margin to the second bend but gave way once headed nearing upper
stretch.

ROYALS' LIL DIVA broke sharply, angled inwards dictating the pace on a clear advantage a bit off the rail, forged clear after being roused in upper stretch
and widened the margin under pressure. NORDIC QUEEN tracked off the first flight racing three wide into the turn. then continued in that path to prevail for
the place honors. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT, unhurried between foes in early stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn and continued with interest to
gain some position inside foes. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES, forwardly placed along the inside pursuing the pacesetter, tipped outside that foe racing into the
turn to lodge a brief bid nearing upper stretch but came up empty in the drive. AMARETTO DI AMORE, bumped at the start, raced a bit erratically under
restraint along the inside to the turn and failed to menace. ANNIE M broke inwards bumping a rival, settled between foes and never gained contention.
CHARLIES MISSILE angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to the turn, switched out racing into upper stretch and abruptly emptied out.

Footnotes
SHES GOT THE POWER broke well in the second flight, caught three wide between foes through the opening bend, moved forward going down the
backstretch to gain an inside position into the far turn, shifted out at the quarter pole, headed leader at the top of the stretch, dug in during the final eighth
and prevailed on the wire. KALLINIKI broke sharply from the gate to the lead, angled over to the inside through the opening bend, dictated the pace while
under constant pressure from MIZZANNA, continued to lead into the stretch when headed by SHES GOT THE POWER, dug in deep stretch and finished
willing to the wire to just miss. INDAWIN was caught four wide into the first turn, continued in the same path down the backstretch while traveling just off the
dueling leaders, asked with right-handed encouragement while three wide on the far turn and stayed on well to be a game third. SUPERSTAR BEA was
caught two wide between foes just behind the pacesetter, lost ground between foes heading down the backstretch, angled inside into the far turn to save
ground and finished evenly. PIPER ROSE was allowed to settle between foes, improved position on the far turn then ran into traffic heading off the bend,
shifted five wide midstretch and ran on evenly for a minor award. BIG ANDY was off slow from the gate, settled well back early, commenced brief bid
between the three eighths and the quarter pole to get within striking distance but flattened out in the lane. SHE B GLAMOROUS was allowed to settle well
back inside while saving ground on the first turn, steadied at the three eighths when responding to a rank foe, and had no late response through the lane.
MIZZANNA pressed the early pace on the outside through the opening half, failed to match strides and gave way past the quarter pole. MIDNIGHT
GARDEN tracked the pace on the rail through the opening bend, continued down the backstretch then got rank nearing the half mile pole and he retreated
in the final half.

Footnotes
GYPSY REWARD, unhurried between foes in second flight racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance on the pacesetter three wide into the
turn, moved to wrest the advantage entering the lane and went well clear under firm encouragement. BAILOUT KELA, forwardly placed between foes in the
opening stages, raced along the inside on the turn tracking just behind the pacesetter, tipped out three wide racing through the stretch and continued with a
steady late effort to narrowly prevail for the place honors on the wire. SHEZONEZESTREET, urged setting the pace outside rivals in the opening quarter,
angled inside entering the turn continuing to dictate terms, couldn't match the winner leaving the furlong marker and faded late. POCKETFULLOFPOSIES,
off slowly, switched outside foes while being prompted to regain contention on the backstretch, steadily advanced on the leaders in the four path on the turn
but flattened out in upper stretch. STRABELLA made brief pursuit of the leaders between foes but emptied out early. CHAPLAIN, reluctant loading, tracked
off the first flight early, made some brief progress three wide between foes racing into the turn and gave way. ELEGANCE N TONIC flashed brief pace along
the inside but gave way early. LOCK IT DOWN was scratched at the gate.

Footnotes
CANDY WOMPUS was settled between foes in the opening stages, gained momentum splitting foes three deep nearing upper stretch and produced a
steady late response to prevail in time under firm handling. FINDING SILVER tracked the pacesetter inside a rival racing through the backstretch, tipped out
entering upper stretch, moved to gain the advantage between calls late but couldn't contain the winner. LIBERTARIAN, off a bit slowly, was settled along the
inside, saved ground on the turn gaining momentum, then altered course leaving the sixteenth marker after being blocked by a tiring foe. CAPTURE THE
GLORY broke sharply, sprinted well clear of the field racing into the turn but faltered late. BIG LEAGUE BENNY tracked the off the second flight along the
inside but dropped back early. KING OF THE COURT broke slowly, made brief pursuit of the leaders four wide into the turn but emptied out early. JIMMY'S
MARCO tracked the pacesetter outside a rival in second flight in the opening quarter but dropped out early.

Footnotes
IT'S HER TIME tracked the pacesetter between foes from out of striking distance leading the second flight on a narrow margin into the turn, steadily closed
the gap on the leader nearing upper stretch, moved to wrest command midstretch, then went well clear under some left handed encouragement. GHOST
OF GENEVIEVE sprinted clear along the inside racing to the turn, held sway into upper stretch, proved no match when confronted by the winner but
prevailed for the place honors. SAINT SARENA angled to the inside tracking the leaders in second flight, tipped out entering upper stretch and continued
well enough to prevail for a share. I CINC EYE LUV U tracked the leader three wide between foes in second flight racing to the turn and continued evenly
into the lane. SENSE OF FLURRY angled inwards to track the leader four wide as part of the second flight racing to the turn, then gave way nearing the
lane. SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, caught in close quarters early, dropped off the second flight and failed to menace thereafter. VOODOO FIRE broke awkwardly
and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HOT HABANERO sprinted clear of the field a bit off the rail on the backstretch, held sway on a commanding margin to upper stretch and was kept to firm
right handed pressure. INDYD'ORO tracked off the second flight outside a rival racing to the turn, was fanned to the four path in upper stretch and continued
well enough to prevail for the place honors. EXODUS AND HOPE angled to the inside early, saved ground to upper stretch but lacked the needed late
response. SURELY A LEGEND, urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter into the turn, emptied out midstretch. DIGGS WON was urged tracking the
pacesetter outside a rival in second flight, shifted three wide entering the lane and faded late. MOXY'S GAL trailed.
