Footnotes
SIR GRAYVENSCROFT was eased back and trailed early, advanced along the rail on the turn, moved out and split rivals late and was up in time. SILVER
SIGNATURE stalked the leaders along the inside, angled out into the stretch, made a gradual gain but was outfinished. ULTIMATE ANSWER controlled the
pace along the inside, shook clear to midstretch then yielded. THE BAND COMING chased off the pace, swung wide into the lane with some late energy.
MOJO JOJO dropped well behind then passed fading rivals. KATZISALLIHOPEFOR prompted the pace three wide to the quarter pole and faltered.
THELONIOUS pressed the leader in the two path then gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
MUROMEC settled inside, advanced strongly on the final turn, slipped through inside drifting pacesetter into the stretch and drew off. MYSTIFIED crowded
soon after the start, rushed to the front, held a clear lead but weakened while holding the place. BROKE AN BROKEN was taken up when rival swung out
near the three quarters, raced wide and flattened out late. WHY NOT BOURBON prompted the pace along the inside then began fading on the final turn.
SNOOKERED chased within striking range inside and lacked a rally. LATE SURGE trailed early, moved very wide and faltered. SKINNY DIPPIN broke a bit
out at the break, raced wide and retreated. SOCIETY EXPRESS broke sluggishly and dropped back then was never in contention.

STREGA broke in at the start, chased while angling out down the backstretch, took command at the 3/8 pole and held gamely. MY GIRL SKY was
squeezed at the break, unhurried down the backstretch ,was roused between horses on the turn and early stretch and was a game 2nd while chasing the
winner. SILVER MAGNATIZED broke out and was rated near the rear ,angled out for the stretch run while in tight between horses and came running to be a
clear third. KEEP IT NEAT was allowed to settle in the early stages, asked while entering the second turn and levelled out down the lane for a minor share.
FORESTERS PRINCESS raced three wide on both turns, made a mild rally while turning for home and had nothing left final eighth. SILENT GHOST broke
in then was away sharply, set the pace down the backstretch, was collared by the winner at the 3/8 pole and retreated.

Footnotes
IMA BEAST settled behind a wall of rivals opening quarter, bid inside, angled out in the stretch and wore down the pacesetter in the final yards. SIX FEET
APART broke alertly and controlled the pace, bid clear into the stretch but was caught approaching the wire. STERLING SPEED dropped back early then
showed energy along the inside late. DIAMOND CRUSH raced close up between rivals to the stretch and faded. OL' BLONDIE chased three wide, bid at
the quarter pole then flattened out in the stretch. BID ONCE trailed early then passed a pair of rivals without menacing. IMAGERY raced well behind inside
under rating, swung wide on the turn then proved empty. SPEEDY LYNN pursued the leaders inside then gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
EPILOGUE patiently handled, advanced between rivals when ready on the turn then surged clear through the final furlong. SUNSPEAR settled inside the
dueling leaders, moved out at the quarter pole, and was just up for the place. MOON OVER MONTANA chased wide throughout, faded briefly on the turn
then came again with a mild rally outside. ARI GOLD SPEEDWAGN trailed early along the inside then made a gradual gain in the stretch. DOT'S VISION
prompted the pace outside, led at the five sixteenths pole then weakened. LION'S GOLDENHEART raced within striking range between rivals then came up
empty. TRICKY MAGICIAN set a pressured pace inside to midway on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
QUIET WYATT broke out and settled mid pack early, was asked on the turn and wore down the pacesetter late. RIGHTEOUS ROBBIE showed speed and
repelled an early challenge on the the turn ,dug in down the stretch but could not hold off the late challenge of the winner. WHERE IS ESSA chased the
leader early, made a mild run on the turn and levelled out while still a clear third. MYSTIC POINT was allowed to settle mid pack with the winner, was asked
on the turn and flattened out down the lane. STORMIN' HUMOR steadied at the start and was never a factor. SCENIC HOLIDAY broke slow and was
roused going into the turn and was not a threat. M C JACKHAMMER had a sluggish start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SHELLY THE ROCKET stalked the pacesetter, took over into the stretch and held rival safe under steady handling through the stretch.
CHANCEWORTHTAKING made a menacing four wide move on the turn, loomed a threat but proved second best. MY BABY JANE chased in the two path
then inside on the turn and continued willingly. DIXIEWISH lacked speed, advanced wide on the turn then flattened out. WANNA PLAY dropped well behind
then picked off rivals wide in the lane. IMPULSIVELY trailed early then passed fading rivals. LEGAL STEPS quickly sped to the front, vied into the stretch
then faltered. POSITIVE dropped back early and was never a factor. INTO EMPIRES SONG was urged close up three wide down the backstretch then gave
way.
