FREDDY SOTO bobbled at the start, was forwardly placed three wide, closed willingly to make the lead in deep stretch and just lasted. FAHRENHEIT broke
in front, dropped back and altered course from the rail to the five path, surged determinedly while drifting out through the stretch and just missed. GOLDEN
READY had good early speed inside, angled out two wide on the turn, drew closer in mid stretch then was outfinished. KING VALERO broke in a tangle,
trailed into the stretch and closed a gap late. SOUL OF DISCRETION sprinted to the lead two wide soon after the start, dropped inside, set the pace until
deep stretch then weakened. SUPER VALENTINE well placed, failed to respond.

Footnotes
STUNT MAN settled just behind the leaders along the rail, drew closer on the turn, angled out in mid stretch, closed with a burst of speed through the final
sixteenth and was along in time. MUTINY away alertly, set a pressured pace into the stretch, shook clear along the inside then couldn't handle the late
charge of the winner. TALE OF LACEY with the second flight, passed tiring rivals four wide through the stretch. MCGRAW prompted the pace while hung
out in the six path early, dropped inward entering the turn, kept on until the furlong marker then weakened. RACIN' JACIN vied for the lead between horses
and was through after half. KINGDOM DIAMOND was no factor. KID RUSSELL was through after a half.

GRINS N' WINS allowed to settle, circled rivals five wide through the stretch and proved best while fully extended. CAT'S RHYTHM unhurried, dropped
inside into the turn, swung wide, rallied determinedly in the seven path through the stretch and just missed. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE dueled for the lead along
the inside into the stretch, gained the advantage then was outfinished. PANAMANIAC close up, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch then leveled off.
DANCIN' ROSIE pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. UCANTKEEPUP hopped at the start and was no threat. FRONT CIRCLE
battled for the early lead two wide and was through after a half.

Footnotes
PENNIESANDDIMES pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, was carried out to the six path by the leader, responded under right handed urging to
make the lead before the furlong marker then finished full of run to win going away. SASSY POWER stalked the pace along the rail, had a mild late rally and
finished second best. HAUGHTY PRAISE unhurried early, found her best stride late in the four path. GLIMMERGLASS was bumped at the start, sprinted to
the lead, set the pace into the stretch, drifted to the five path and tired. SHOSHA SHOSHA well placed, failed to respond. AUGMENTING ASSETS bore out
at the start bumping a rival and was no threat. FIRST TAP had speed into the turn then gave way. ALWAYS ON THE ROX hopped at the start and was no
factor.
