Footnotes
THE GRAY BLUR set a measured pace along the inside was challenged on the outside by FORT RIDGE on the turn and may have been briefly headed
took the turn in much better fashion than that rival and drew clear through the stretch to win handily. FORT RIDGE stalked the pace in the two path may
have a brief lead on the turn but came very wide entering the stretch and was no match for the winner through the lane. ZENUCCI was allowed to settle on
the inside had the perfect ground saving trip and launched his bid on the turn was moving well but flattened out in the stretch and could not make up the
needed ground. RAMAAH was up close to the early pace while three wide dropped back going into the turn and was not a factor after that. MOSTA FLYIN
was away in good order and close to the early pace while four deep got to the two path on the turn but was empty through the stretch.

Footnotes
PUBLIC RECORD stalked the pace in the two path came out a bit in the upper stretch then drifted in late and was able to hang tough for the victory.
GILDERSLEEVE was off a step slow and was towards the back early saved ground up the backstretch but had to come three wide on the turn angled out
for the drive but then shifted to the inside when PUBLIC RECORD came out a bit finished well but could not go by the winner. OSCAR CHOICE was
allowed to settle on the inside was shuffled back while in tight along the inside on the turn came back and was finishing well while in tight again along the rail
in the final strides. FALCON HEAVY was away a step slow and then settled in the back came four to five wide on the turn and was finishing well. TED
STRIKER made a sweeping four to five wide move to get into contention entering the stretch loomed boldly on the outside but faltered in the final sixteenth.
CONFESS was the quickest early and set the fractions along the inside was still in contention in the upper stretch but gave way late. ROYAL DE BE broke
to the outside and was quickly gathered and challenged for the lead three wide but began a steady fade into the turn.

ONEROLLOFTHEDICE stalked the pace to the turn exploded to the front without being asked on the turn drew clear while the rider looked back to see if
anyone was close and won as the rider pleased while geared down. MISS PAT'S GIRL was along the inside in the second tier and saved all the ground but
could not make any headway on the easiest of winners but was able to get second. GOLDEN SMILES was in the two path in the second tier throughout and
was able to get third while never a threat to the winner. LISTEN UP tried to steal the race with early speed on the inside but was passed by
ONEROLLOFTHEDICE in a flash held gamely though the stretch but could not keep up and was outfinished for second and third.

Footnotes
BUDDY REAUX stalked the early pace was asked to go to the front into the second turn and quickly responded to open a good lead and was never
challenged after that to win as the rider pleased under mild urging. SCREWBALL was always three to four wide made a bid up the backstretch to get into
contention got close to the eventual winner on the turn but could not go with that one through the lane while second best. HELIOCHROME was in the two
path on the first turn got to the rail up the backstretch but could not go with the top two in the stretch while third best. CHOPPA STYLE was reluctant to load
raced along the inside in tight quarters dropped back came four wide up the backstretch but could not sustain the move in a good effort. SIDE BAR (IRE)
was able to get to the rail by the first turn came in the two path up the backstretch to get into contention but then faded. CLERIC was along the inside in a
tight pack and had no rally while never a serious threat. GOROSTIETA'S LOVE was up close for the first half and then stopped quickly.

Footnotes
MY BOY SAM showed good early speed and was able to get to the rail was battling for the lead on the inside was headed by GOBLIN at the top of the
stretch but came back for the win in a strong drive. JOZZE broke a step slow to be well off the pace got a ground saving trip and was closing best to finish
on even terms with LOU'S ARROW for the place. LOU'S ARROW came five wide on the turn and was farthest out through the lane was making up ground
late and finished on even terms with JOZZE for second. GOBLIN showed good early speed in the two post to engage for the lead took a clear lead at the
top of the stretch but gave way in the final fifty yards while drifting out. The rider of LEVEL lodged and objection claiming interference in the stretch but the
Stewards ruled there would be no change in the order of finish. LEVEL was inside early then dropped back and came three wide in the stretch got in a bit
tight when GOBLIN drifted out in the lane and steadied very briefly. After a jockeys objection, the Stewards made no change in the order of finish. NO
HUDDLE was away very slow spotting the field five lengths and was never a factor after that. TAYLOR TOWN was towards the back at the start and lost
contact with the field as they came out of the chute and onto the main track.
