Footnotes
LULUMARU showed the way from the two path around the first turn, continued to lead under a hold up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn,
kicked clear entering the stretch and just held off a late closer while drifting out late. HONEST WOMAN raced in the two path around the first turn, chased
the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued to pursue that rival from the two path around the far turn and gained ground steadily on the outside
down the lane, just missing. SUSAN STRONG trailed the field from the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace, began to
improve position slightly around the far turn and in upper stretch and was not a threat to the top two. BOBBIES REASON raced between horses in the two
path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and finished evenly while
never threatening. KONA KATIE raced in the three path around the first turn, came up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated
the far turn from the two and three path and made no bid. SEE WHAT'S WHAT saved ground around the first turn, raced inside up the backstretch, dropped
back to trail well behind the field headed into the far turn, was eased to the wire and walked off. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION, THIS RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MADAM PIE stalked the leader on the outside through the opening furlong, moved up to duel between horses for what remained of the backstretch,
continued to battle while saving ground around the turn and in upper stretch, bumped repeatedly with APPRECIABLE near the eighth pole and gamely
prevailed. APPRECIABLE settled at the back of the pack for the opening strides, quickly switched to the outside and moved up the field, dueled in the three
path headed into the turn, battled outside from there, took the lead briefly in upper stretch, bumped multiple times with MADAM PIE with a furlong to go,
raced gamely from there despite her rider losing the whip at the sixteenth pole and gave way in the final strides. ZANDY DEE raced off the pace up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position late. MILU ROCKET hit the gate and was away slowly, trailed well behind the field
up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and improved position in the stretch while never threatening. BEACH BODY led the field in the
early going, relinquished the lead headed into the turn, continued to drop back while saving ground from there and tired further in the stretch. A STEWARDS
INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE STRETCH RUN CONCERNING THE TOP TWO FINISHERS. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE
ORDER OF FINISH.

battled back gamely in the stretch to pull clear. THUNDERTAKESDALEAD bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, dueled up the
backstretch, took the lead while racing in the two and three path around the turn, was collared by the eventual winner in midstretch and chased that rival
home, the best of the rest. HALF A DOODLE raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while racing
in the two path around the turn and continued to gain ground in the lane while proving to be no match for the top two. HALF A BUCK bumped with the

between horses in the opening stages, chased the leaders from the two path into and around the turn and faded from there. CHIEFWEAVE raced off the
