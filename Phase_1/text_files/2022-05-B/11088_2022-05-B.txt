FREEDOM'S START set the pace while four wide to keep safe of the loose horse, then was sent down leaving the turn and kicked clear, then remained
clear to prove best under a drive. SACHMO tracked the early pace and made a inside bid leaving the turn but needed more. KNOCKDOWN KID prompted
the early pace four to three wide, then raced three wide on the turn and faded in the drive. FIRST FORCE was fractious in the gate, broke in and bumped
BUFF AND SHINE at the start, then raced wide early while far back, not a factor. BUFF AND SHINE st5umbled badly and was bumped at the start, causing
the rider to fall off, the horse continued running with the field to the wire, was caught and walked off. The Stewards looked at the start but left the race as is.

BERMONDSEY was fractious in the gate, away alertly to set the pace from the inside and clear, then drew off by the quarter pole, then was kept to pressure
to prove much the best. DOMINANT FACTOR was allowed to settle early four wide, made a three wide middle move to move into contention, then proved to
be no match for the winner, clearly second best. SWEEPIN HARD was reserved on the inside, came three wide into the lane and angled out in the drive and
had no rally. MY MAGICAL MAN tracked the pace two wide and tired.

CRITICAL THINKING prompted the pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, then vied for command leaving the furlong maker and was up late to prove
best after a long drive. KEIKO KRAHE dueled for the lead on the inside and then dug in gamely in the furlong grounds and led late but was outkicked, held
place award. GANDI dueled for the lead three wide, then made a bid bearing the furlong marker to poke a head in front, battled between rivals by the
sixteenth marker and was outfinished late. COWBOY MALICE stalked the pace and made a five wide bid on the turn and was roused leaving the five
sixteenths and then weakened in the drive.

MARIE FROM PARIE was away alertly to be soon clear and set the pace while off the rail, remained clear to the wire while being kept to left handed crop
urging. TUFF BIRD chased the early pace and was on the inside on the turn, shifted out three wide leaving the three sixteenths and finished willingly but
could not get to the winner, second best. TIZ PROMISING RVF was void of early speed, was four wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and offered
a late rally. LADYOFDRAGONSTONE was allowed to settle early and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. MOSCOWS GOT TALENT was settled
two wide early and weakened.
