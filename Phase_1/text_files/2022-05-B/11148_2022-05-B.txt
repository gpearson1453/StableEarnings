THE GREEN PLANET stalked the early pace, checked briefly while entering the turn, angled out for the stretch drive and drew away. FOREST VIXEN was
away alertly, chased the early pace, took command around the turn but could not hold off the challenge of the winner. BITTERSWEETBIZNESS was rated
early on, roused 3 wide on the turn and closed willingly down the stretch to capture third. LAILA'S CHARM broke sharp and set the early fractions, was
collared at the 3/8 pole and flattened out through the stretch. KEYSTONE LAW brushed gate at the start and was allowed to trail early, saved ground
throughout but could not chase down field through stretch.

weakened in the drive. SOONER LUNAR tracked the early pace two wide, then was on the inside on the turn and checked nearing the quarter pole and
weakened. MORSTACHY'S tracked the ;pace four wide and stopped. AWESOME BOURBON was through early and was pulled up at the three eighths

HIP TO YOUR TRICKS vied for the lead on the inside, then rated back on the turn while continuing to save ground, made a inside bid leaving the turn and
hit the front nearing the furlong marker and edged away to prove best under a drive. DR CHROME was rated along early on the inside, fell back on the turn,
then closed well late on the inside. LIONESQUE was with the pace early three wide, then stalked the pace on the turn three wide and was roused by the
quarter pole, but lacked the needed kick in the drive while saving the show award. SUIGU STAR was taken back early, raced two wide on the turn and
swung out four wide for the drive, lugged in by the furlong marker, then was corrected and angled out nearing the sixteenth peg and offered a belated rally.
MAYOR OF ESSA bobbled at the start, then went up to vie for the lead between horses, then went on to set the pace while clear on the turn and two wide,
then weakened the final furlong.

CHURCHTOWN stalked the early pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn and then slowly edged away to prove best under a drive. BRON
AND BROW prompted the pace two wide and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then kept on gamely but could not match strides with the winner
late, second best. WARP RIDE set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the furlong marker and weakened, bested rest. TWENTY FOUR MAMBA
was taken back three to four wide and had no rally. HEAT MERCHANT was bumped at the start, then was well placed on the inside and weakened. UNCLE
SPIDER was hard held the first quarter of a mile and then had no response.

IT'S GAME KNIGHT was bumped at the start, vied for command and raced on the inside on the turn, made a bid leaving the turn and shook clear, then
drew out to prove much the best under a drive. CEREBRO was bumped at the start, vied for command four wide, then continued to battle for command
three wide on the turn, proved to be no match for the winner while lasting for the place award. MUSICAL SPELL pressed the early pace in between rivals
three wide early, then fell off the pace and tracked the front runners three wide on the turn, shifted out four wide in the drive and came again to just miss the
place award. YOU MAKE ME HAPPY vied for the lead between rivals and two wide to the quarter pole and then weakened in the drive. SOLIS chased the
pace and was three wide on the turn and had no rally. FLAWLESS RULER was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. SAME

ARTIE'S STORM was well rated while two wide to the top of the stretch, tipped out four wide for aim on the front runners, closed well to edge clear in the
final hundred yards to prove best under a mild drive. FROSTED OVER shifted off the inside to stalk the pace two wide by the seven furlong marker on the
first turn, went up to press the pace two wide leaving the five sixteenths, then made a three wide bid off the turn and took over nearing the furlong marker,
but was out kicked by the winner in the furlong grounds, second best. MIGHTY HEART set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the second turn
and faded in the final furlong, bested rest. RIPTIDE ROCK was allowed to settle early, was three wide on the backstretch and on the far turn, came four
wide into the drive and had no kick. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE was three wide into the first turn, then was reserved early and was two wide on the turn then
lacked a rally. SPECIAL FORCES was settled back early, shifted to be three wide on the backstretch, then shifted back to the inside at the three eighths
marker and saved ground on the far turn, swung out four wide for the drive and had no rally.

Footnotes
FIRST ROUND PICK was well placed on the inside to the quarter pole, eased off the inside and tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim, closed well to
get up in time under a drive. LOADED VIXEN broke out slightly at the start and then went up to set the pace on the inside, came two wide into the lane and
shook clear leaving the three sixteenths but was denied on the wire to just miss. SACRED DANCER was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on
the turn, eased out and made a four wide bid leaving the turn but flattened out, bested rest. THEODOROPOULOS was bumped at the start, stalked the
pace two wide, made a bid two to three wide leaving the quarter pole but weakened in the drive. TIZ BIZNESS was settled back early, then was three wide
by the quarter pole and angled out wide leaving the turn and had no rally. AERONAUTICA chased the early pace four wide and weakened. NADIABIZNIZ
chased the early pace three wide and tired.
