Footnotes
ORO AZTECA settled off the early pace while in the four path, moved to challenge the pacesetter in mid-turn, gained a short lead in late turn, quickly
extended the advantage into the lane, drew off when asked while being geared down in the last fifty yards. METALLIC MAN was bumped at the start, raced
in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the four path and moved up to be clear for the place spot while no threat to the winner.
MISCHIEVIOUSBUD tracked the pace through the turn and into the lane and regained the show spot while no threat to the top ones. MUSTY RED stepped
out at the start bumping outside rival, saved ground through the turn and into the lane and improved position while not a factor. ROCKET DOCKET chased
the pace into the turn while along the inside then steadily faded. GEORGE THE MAN was away alertly to gain a clear lead soon after the start, was rated on
the lead into the turn, joined by the winner in mid-turn, stayed with that one until late turn then was done straightening into the lane.

Footnotes
CITY DRIFTER settled off the early pace while in the two path, tipped into the three path in late turn, took aim on the leader when straightened, inched up
through the lane and was up in time. ROLIN WITH OLIN set the pace while near the rail, continued on a clear lead through the turn and into the lane, was
joined by the winner near the eighth pole then gave ground grudgingly. MY SWEET KAT tracked the pace along the inside through the turn and into the
lane, waited briefly for rail room near the eighth pole, inched up through the final sixteenth and just missed the place spot. MR MANNING chased the pace
from the three path into the lane, was between rivals with an eighth to go, shifted out into the four path and lacked the needed response. ASH FLAT was in
the four path through the turn when towards the back, came into the lane from the five path and never was a factor. KITTENS ADAIR was along the inside
throughout and made no impact.

Footnotes
PURE TAP settled early while off the inside, moved up from the four to the three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path with aim on
the top one, gained the lead once straightened, was challenged nearing the eighth pole then put that one away inside the sixteenth. SHINY SHOES was in
the four path through the turn when never far back, came into the lane from the five path with momentum, challenged the winner with an eighth to go then
could not stay with that one while second best in her debut and against the boys. PURSUANT stalked the pace from the three path through the turn, was in
good position into the lane then lacked a closing response. MYDADSBETRTHANYURS in the two path through the turn when near the back, swung into the
lane from the four five path and moved up while not a threat. LITTLE JOHN COLONY raced in the three to two path through the turn when never far back,
was asked for more into the lane from the four path and lacked a closing response. LET'S GO JOE set the pace from the two path through the turn then
gave way after entering the lane. SMILE LIKE KYLE chased the pace into the turn then steadily faded. KORDELL was done early while always last.

KNIGHT'S MOVE unhurried while in the two path through the turn, gained momentum into the lane while angling to the six path, continued with good
momentum through the final eighth and got up in the last stride. BLUEGRASS PRAYER raced behind a wall of rivals, moved five wide just after the
five-sixteenths pole to challenge for the top spot, continued on in close proximity while straightening in the six path, dueled with T.G.PRADO through the
final furlong, inched to the front late and was just nailed at the wire. T. G. PRADO pressed then vied for the lead four wide through the turn, gained the lead
into the lane, still on a short lead while under pressure from the runner-up with and eighth to go, continued close up to late then yielded.
TAKECHARGEJUSTICE in the two or three path through the turn, came into the lane from the three path and slowly gained. EPIC THE LEGEND vied three
wide through the turn and between rivals through the turn, continued close up into the lane then weakened. COPPER HARBOR trailed early while near the
inside, came off the inside into the lane and moved up while not a threat. HOBNOBIN GENERAL vied for the lead from between rivals through late turn then
faltered once turning into the lane. CASPER JUSTICE vied for the lead along the inside through the late turn then was empty into the lane. SHAD never a
factor while in the three path through the turn. MARVIN'S PASSION raced in the four path through the turn and was done in late turn.
