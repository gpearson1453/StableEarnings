REGAL MAX broke alertly to show the way, responded to challenge from GRAY ADMIRAL, dueled through the turn, edged clear under intermittent
encouragement. BECKHAM JAMES raced four to five wide leaving the opening turn, angled out into the lane, closed gradually under urging and got up.
GRAY ADMIRAL stalked the pace, moved up alongside REGAL MAX to challenge the pace leaving the backstretch, dueled into the stretch and gave way.
COUNTRIFIED trailed the field early, gained closer order into the far turn, and offered a late run. CATS TOUCH raced four wide into the opening turn, sat off
the pacesetters, and was outkicked. QUINTO SOL raced four to five wide entering the first turn, raced wide through the backstretch, and lacked a closing
response. ALONGTHEWATCHTOWER saved ground inside and tired early.

ALL THAT GOLD quickest out of the chute, saved ground while showing the way through the backstretch, drew off leaving the final turn then opened up
finishing much the best. REMAIN CALM raced from the back of the pack, angled out to the four path leaving the backstretch, encountered traffic after the
quarter pole, shifted out matching strides outside of FOREVER JIMMY and inched clear. FOREVER JIMMY raced wide through the backstretch, advanced
outside leaving the final turn then drifted in under right-handed urging brushing CITY WOLF'S GUY, dueled inside of REMAIN CALM and was edged out for
place honors. IMPERIAL DASH broke slow then was gapped and passed tiring rivals. CITY WOLF'S GUY sat in range while four to five wide, was brushed
at the quarter pole and yielded through drive. HUNGARIAN JOE chased wide early, dropped to the rail leaving the backstretch, was in tight then hit the rail
at the three sixteenth marker and flattened. GRADY'S SONG sat in striking range while three wide, steadied at the three sixteenth and retreated. AMIGO
QUERIDO was not a factor. STEWARDS INQUIRY- The Stewards conducted an inquiry into the stretch run regarding FOREVER JIMMY but found no
reason to alter the original order of finish. ** TIMER MALFUNCTION- The race was hand timed due to a timer malfunction.

Footnotes
GLAVA broke alertly to set the pace, moved clear in the final turn and won going away. DECOY jostled away, shifted outside through the backstretch, rallied
three wide into the stretch, chased the eventual winner to no avail. CHRIS'S COMMAND vied inside of GLAVA, was unable to moved on with rival and
flattened out. RAVINA LANE chased the pacesetters from the three path and improved late. GREAT VISION squeezed out at the start, raced from the back
of the pack, lodged an all out bid from the rail and was edged out late. ESTIFRAAD squeezed out leaving the gate, allowed to settled outside and was done
early. UNUSUAL ACCOUNT raced five wide leaving the backstretch and failed to threaten. FREUDS VISION sandwiched leaving, angled outward and was
unable to reach contention. PUMP THE BRAKES broke in bumping into inside foes, chased pace from the four path, wilted abruptly at the head of the lane
then was eased.
