DOUBLE VISION Away best, set the pace along the rail, remained clear leaving the furlong marker, then began to drift out some nearing the sixteenths,
again under left handed urging taking away the path of NOBLE ENDEAVOR late and was clear to the line for the win. NOBLE ENDEAVOR In hand early,
gained along the three path into the lane, angled out, responded and then took up sharply when the winner drifted out late losing all chance. NUEVA YORK
Well placed along the two path into the turn, appeared blocked nearing the quarter pole, waited, altered out nearing the furlong marker and finished with
interest. DEVIOUS MO Tracked along the rail to the lane and weakened. TALE OF MINESHAFT Broke slow, saved ground on the turn and failed to take
place. A Steward inquiry was posted concerning the winner, also a claim of foul was lodged by the rider of NOBLE ENDEAVOR against the winner for
interference in deep stretch, resulted in the disqualification of DOUBLE VISION from first to second. STRAIGHT EIGHT Checked early when in tight, tracked
along the two path on the turn and tired.
