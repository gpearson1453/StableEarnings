ERRATIQUE showed speed from the inside, had the lead on the turn and with mild pressure through the stretch prevailed. HONEY GIRL was in range,
moved up on the turn and had a bid from the three path at the top of the stretch but was outfinished. HARDROADTOGLORY stalked the early leader and
was a factor on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no late kick. WICKEN CENTS was well back, showed little and had no impact.
QUIET ASCOT was in touch but chased on the turn and was empty.

Footnotes
ACT OF BOB was away alertly, had a slim lead on the turn and was kept to task. ACE DESTROYER tracked the leader and forced the pace on the turn but
from the three path at the top of the stretch was no match for the winner. AWESOME MINER stumbled slightly at the start and saved ground on the turn but
needed more. TORPEDO MAX was in range and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no response. JACK BEANSTALK
was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch was not a factor.

EXPRESS BANKING stalked the early leader, dueled on the turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. KRZ SOCIETY was away
alertly and had a slim lead on the turn but was second best in a good effort. BLONDE ATTITUDE was in touch and raced evenly from the inside on the turn
but needed more. CASSIE'S RAINBOW was unhurried early and moved up on the turn but was no real threat. SNELL FLICKA was in range and roused
from between foes on the turn but had no kick. EIGHT SPEED showed no speed and was hustled along on the turn but had no impact. MUSICAL FLIGHT
broke poorly and showed little while outrun.

Footnotes
MS. P'S BELLA tracked the early leaders, was a factor on the far turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch fought gamely for the win. MARVEL
was unhurried early moved up on the far turn and from the four path at the top of the stretch was all out. SILENT BUT VIOLENT showed no speed, raced
evenly on the far turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for show. READY TO RUMBLE forced the early pace and had the lead on the
far turn but gave way. THANKS LAURA hopped at the start and gained ground on the far turn but finished evenly. OUR STORMY SOPHIA set a pressured
pace but lost ground on the far turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch faded. REGAL BILLEE was in range but chased on the far turn and was
not a factor. HIPPIE CHICK was in touch early but lost ground on the far turn and was empty. TALLY ROAD was off the pace and showed nothing in a dull
effort.

Footnotes
NATASHA'S BIZNIZ was away alertly, set the pace, had a clear lead on the turn and was kept to task. UNABLE stalked the early leader and was a factor on
the turn but was clearly second best. SHES ASTYLISH KATZ was unhurried early and checked into the turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch
was all out. SHE AINT NO JOKE showed no speed, had a mild gain on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for a share.
SEAQUELLE tracked the early leaders and raced evenly on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch had no kick. PAPA'S SILVER was
hustled early and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. PRINCESS LAVENDER was in range and raced evenly on the turn but was no menace.
HUMORUS HOLIDAY was in mid pack and roused on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch had no response. ONLY BELIEVE was well
back and closed the gap on the turn but was no factor. LIBERTYINBLUE was off the pace, showed little and had no impact. DANCE FOR GOLD was
hustled early but chased on the turn and was empty. CLOUD RUNNER was in touch but lost ground on the turn and had nothing left.

DETERMINED LOVE tracked the early leaders, lacked room on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch drew off. EVER SO D'WILD stalked
the early leader and was a factor on the turn but from the six path at the top of the stretch was second best. ZOYSIA set the pace, had the lead on the turn
but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. HOLD THE APPLAUSE was unhurried early and hustled along on the turn but needed more.
ROSIEJEWEL DANCER was in range and raced evenly on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch had no rally. HASN'T HIT ME YET
showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was not a factor. JARA was off the pace, chased on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the
stretch failed to fire.

and vied through the stretch but was outfinished. CAPE ROMANCE was off the pace, moved up on the turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch
was up for a share. FEDERAL LAW showed no speed and saved ground on the turn but was no real threat. HIT THIS TOWN stalked the early leaders and
had a good position on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch weakened. TOBRUK was away alertly but chased on the turn and came up

M V SPEED was in touch, a factor on the turn and with the lead from the three path at the top of the stretch proved best. MAXIMUM DANGER tracked the
early leaders, was roused on the turn and finished well. INVISIBLE FRIEND was in mid pack, had a mild gain on the turn and from the four path through the
stretch was up for show. RED MAPLE forced the pace and dueled on the turn but had nothing left. SKILLS TEST set a pressured pace and had a slim lead
on the turn but gave way. TAKE CHARGE GENT was off the pace, showed little and was never in contention. RADCLIFFE was off slow and showed
nothing in a dull effort. WONNEFRAC was hustled early but clipped heals into the turn and lost his rider. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE RUN INTO
THE TURN RESULTED IN INVISIBLE FRIEND BEING DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH.
