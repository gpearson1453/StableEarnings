GULFSTREAM WAY set the pace early, wax on the inside into the lane and drew away late in the stretch under a steady drive. RED KNOBS tracked the
pace early, was on the inside into the lane, made a bid in the stretch from the inside but was no match for the winner late. MR SIPPI stalked the pace early,
was in the two path into the lane while making a bid but weakened late in the stretch run. AMONGST FRIENDS chased the pace early, raced in the four
path through the turn and moved up in the stretch drive. TONAL IMPACT was a tad slow and bumped foe at the start, trailed the field early, was in the three
path into the lane and improved position down the lane. SPEIGHTY WAR was bumped at the start, chased the pace early, was in the two path into the lane
and faded late in the stretch. PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE was never a threat. SOROS had early speed then folded up. HUNT THE FRONT was never a
factor.
