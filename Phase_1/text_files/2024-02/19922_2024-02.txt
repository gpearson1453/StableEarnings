RIDICULOUS settled off the rail the first turn, was eased out into the backstretch and picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far
turn in the three path, dug in under steady handling while being forced out later yards, and got up approaching the wire. MASAI MAN stalked from the three
path into the first turn then took the lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, started to
drift when his rider lost his whip leaving the far turn, drifted wider in late stretch and was caught the final yards. EKATI'S VERVE saved ground on the first
turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn and finished well toward the inside. ADVANCE CASH had a brief early
lead two deep while between horses but was met leaving the nine sixteenths pole, gave chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the far turn and
weakened in later yards. BACKATYA stalked inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened.
CHARLIE POTATOES raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

Footnotes
I SEE NOTHING settled in the three path the opening turn, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, eased outward
toward the head of the lane, dug in under steady handling and took over later yards. ASTRAYAL stalked two deep then challenged toward the three eighths
pole, contested even terms two deep on the far turn, dueled for second inside the sixteenth pole but relented the win in later yards. CURB THAT TIGER
saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in
for third the final strides. BOP ZAPPER rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole and contested even terms at the rail on
the far turn, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened stride the final sixteenth. MEETMARYSMAN stalked three wide on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the three eighths pole but lost action behind, nearly unseating his rider approaching the quarter pole and showed little more. HILLBILLY
ROCK raced off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, roughed off the heels of Meetmarysman approaching the quarter
pole and eased from that point.

on the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and drew away later yards. EVERYDAYISAGIFT gave chase and raced close in the three path on the turn,
dueled to even terms mid-stretch but was outfinished the final sixteenth. TAP THE KEG chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn near the rail and
ran evenly in the lane. SK'S HEART gave chase through the backstretch, angled to the six path on the turn and passed rivals widest in the lane. EMPTY

JUST CALL ME AL took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
was steadily handled in the lane. JONAS HILL ROAD stalked two deep the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced
close off the rail on the far turn, but had to settle for second. GHOSTLY LEO stumbled and made contact with Getting Spicy leaving the gate then saved
ground on the opening turn, eased out entering the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and raced in range of the lead in the
three path on the far turn, but weakened in the lane. YACHTSMEN rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase from the three eighths pole and
raced in the three path on the far turn, then weakened. SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase approaching
the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened in the lane. CRUSH 'N RUN rated close inside, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. GETTIN SPICY was bumped at the break, rounded the opening turn about the

Footnotes
OUR GREAT NOTION contested the pace and raced at even terms two deep on the turn, then dug in determinedly to eke out the nod over PLAYING FOR
TWO through the final yards. The latter dueled from the start, contested the rail on the turn and dug in gamely to late stretch before ceding; grudgingly.
DEREKA'S BLUFF gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and finished well at the outside quarters of the runner-up. JUJU ON DA BEAT chased
inside, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little more. LIVANA gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn, drifted toward the head of the lane and
weakened. TUESDAY TOO gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. WARRIORINTHEHOUSE saved ground.
IMINCHARGENOW gave chase and flattened in the three path on the turn. LAURA'S GRAND gave chase and angled widest toward the head of the lane.

Footnotes
SHEWONTTALKTOME gave chase and took the lead three wide past the quarter pole, dueled clear toward the head of the lane and persevered under
steady stretch handling. CANDY TRICKS had a brief early lead then pressured the pace, dropped back at the rail approaching the head of the lane and
flattened in later yards. GHOSTLY ANNA accelerated to the lead toward the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the rail approaching
the quarter, dropped back midway on the turn and weakened in the lane. CUT HIM LOOSE gave chase, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the
lane. UNITE THE GIRLS gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path and ran evenly in the lane. GRUMPY N U KNOW IT chased through the
backstretch, raced in the three path on the turn and showed little in the lane. HOLY MOAT was not a factor. SPECIAL KAYLEE engaged in close early
chase but weakened at the rail on the turn.
