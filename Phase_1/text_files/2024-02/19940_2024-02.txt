Footnotes
NO COINCIDENCES broke well, soon cleared to the inside, set all the pace, not threatened through the stretch under a steady hand ride.
RUNNINTHESTREETS off a step slow, raced back, steered out three wide in some traffic late in the turn, finished willingly to be clear for the place, no real
threat to the winner. Q'S YOUR MAMA away in good order, chased the winner most of the way, no match for that one the final furlong, caught for the place.
WILDWOOD QUEEN forwardly placed toward the inside, came in the two path for the drive, came up empty to finish up evenly. WHO LU went one paced
three to four wide. ADAMANTLY settled in mid pack early, lacked a closing response. PREDICTING off a step slow, void of speed in trailing early, two path
into lane, improved a bit down the stretch, no real threat. STREET PAINTER bumped at the start, raced in mid pack, four wide into the lane, weakened.
MELANIA T finished early when falling back, no factor four wide. BLUE EMBER bumped at the start, began a steady retreat before a half. AIR CASTLE was
always outrun.

Footnotes
SECRET POCKET fell back to trail, continued void of speed into the turn four wide, between horses into the stretch, steered out, challenged on the outside
late, edged clear. STARTDFROMDABOTTOM within striking distance while well out in the strip, four wide turn, challenged between horses and inside the
winner just inside the furlong marker, could not match strides with that one late, held sway for the place. B SUDD broke out, raced back off the pace while in
the two path turn, angled out steadily down the stretch while improving position, getting to the runner up late. JUILLIARD in the second flight while three
wide, in traffic midway on the bend, challenged briefly in midstretch between horses, flattened out in the late going. CAMP DADDY lacked speed while off
the rail early, dropped inside turn, waited briefly into the lane, improved position a bit when clear. BOHEMIAN BO broke out, moved up to clear soon after
the start, showed the way in the two path until a furlong remained, faltered when headed inside the furlong marker. COLD AS HELL broke out, back off the
early pace inside, closer along the rail when forced to wait briefly late in the bend, weakened down the lane. FAVORITE OUTLAW chased the early leader
in the three path, closest late in the turn, continued to press upper stretch then gave way final furlong. LIFE IS A BANQUET mid pack outside early, fell back
while four to five wide through the turn. SUMMER IN MALIBU off a step slow, was not a factor in remaining back.

inside nearing midstretch, edged clear under firm handling. ATTA PARTY prompted the pace in the three path, challenged on the outside in upper stretch,
showed the way past the furlong marker but could not match the winner late. MIDNIGHT TAXES took command after the start, showed the way into and
through the turn in the two path, offered brief resistance to the top pair nearing midstretch then began to gradually weaken. MACHO ROCCO went one
paced throughout while racing in the four path. STUCK N SNOW broke with the field, raced outside, floated out six wide into the lane by AL'S ROMEO,
brushed with that one then went evenly the final furlong. WHERE'S RANDY off a step slow, sluggish early in racing well back, two path into the lane,
improved position through traffic with some modest late energy. CHOCTAW ZIP turned in an even effort while racing toward the inside. AL'S ROMEO
forwardly placed early while three wide, got out to be five wide exiting the turn, brushed with STUCK N SNOW upper stretch then began to fade. HOLUS
BOLUS failed to menace while racing four wide. SHAKE UP trailed most of the way in showing little. MARVELOUS THUNDER was finished after a half
while racing inside.

Footnotes
MR FILLIP unruly in the gate prior to the start, broke alertly, set the pace inside, edged away steadily down the stretch under firm handling. RUN JALEN
RUN behind the first flight inside, steered out for the drive, set down, could do little with the winner late, clear for the place. HAPPY GREY with the pace
outside up the backstretch, continued to vie three wide through the turn, could not keep up with the winner in the drive nor contain the runner up, saved the
show. MORUNNING bothered then steadied in tight soon after the start, moved up to mid pack, came into the stretch off the inside, late run to be getting to
the show horse late. DAILY GRIND in tight just after the start, settled off the pace, four wide into the lane, improved position a bit while not a serious threat
at the wire. MOHAWK RIVER went one paced off the inside, lacked a closing kick. EXCITABLE BOY with the pace for a half while between horses, faltered
in the run down the lane. FIRST BID went evenly while saving ground. AZTEC FIRE in tight just after the start, remained back. GRAND EMPEROR tired
while racing four wide out of the turn. FRANKENSTEINER broke back and was never a threat. MARAVICH broke in to tighten up several rivals, also was
always outrun.

Footnotes
JACKMAN away well, dueled early inside, continued to alternate through the turn up front, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, enough
left to hold the runner up safe in the waning strides. EFFICIENCY fell back to rail after the start, continued to be outrun into the turn while saving ground, got
through while continuing along the inside into the stretch, finished willingly to be getting to the winner. TROPIC STORM raced back off the pace while
outside early, floated out five wide into the stretch, finished up willingly to earn the show. ROB THE RICH also outrun early, three to four wide turn, improved
position down the stretch. MACRON prompted the dueling leaders while three wide for a half, chased the winner past the furlong marker then faltered.
SHADY EMPIRE dueled up front outside the winner for a half, first to blink, backed up through the stretch. JOE FRAZIER last away, moved up to race in the
second flight along the inside, weakened after four furlongs. MAC DADDY TOO in the second flight for a half between foes, angled 4w late turn, backed up
through the stretch.

Footnotes
DIMATIC tracked the first flight along the inside, steered out when looking to advance late in the final turn, engaged the leaders from the outside soon after,
took over, clear, lugged out abruptly with just over a sixteenth to run after a right handed crop, held the runner up at bay in the run to the wire under steady
handling. GIVE ME LIBERTY with the early pace closest to the inside, shuffled back along the rail onto the backstretch, moved out, rebid three wide second
turn, could not match the winner in the drive, stayed on well for the place. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS carried out to be six wide into the first turn when off the
pace, continued back, carried out again to be five wide into the stretch, rallied to narrowly gain the show late, not a threat to the top pair. PROMISSIO in the
second flight early off the inside, between horses and outside the winner far turn, failed to keep up with that one to the wire, not enough late for the show. J
J'S RANGER settled off the pace and the inside, four wide turning for home, failed to muster a rally. SPECIAL DISPATCH broke on top, set or forced the
pace for six furlongs, held a narrow advantage far turn, began to weaken when headed by winner entering the stretch. MANFREDI with the early pace three
wide, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, faltered in the drive. THOUSAND SPRINGS broke back, lacked speed inside, in some traffic turning for
home, improved slightly while never dangerous. WILL TAKE IT carried out five wide into the first turn, remained back and was never a threat. TORNADO
ROAD in mid pack toward the inside, saved ground through the second bend, failed to rally. SPEEDTAIL got out into the first turn, off the pace and the
inside, faded down the lane. WRECK IT fell back to trail soon after the start, was always outrun.

Footnotes
ZEITLOS forward from the start off the inside, challenged on the outside turning for home, drove well clear. TRAVERSE broke out, bumped, raced back and
inside, two path into the lane, inside bid for the place past the furlong marker, gained the nod while not a threat to the winner. I'M THE BOSS OF ME behind
the pace outside, four wide through the turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, outkicked late for that position while also no match for the winner.
DEALING JUSTICE void of speed just off the inside, staged a mild rally to improved position, no real threat. VERYLITTLECENTS back off the pace while
racing outside, four wide through the turn, failed to rally when called on for the drive. KANTEX bumped and was off a step slow, moved up to mid pack,
came up empty for the stretch run. BACKYARD MONEY chased the early leader in the two path, had nothing for the drive. HALAGA back off the pace three
wide, steadied between horses into the turn, fell back to trail and was not a factor. SARAH HARPER broke alertly, cleared to the inside, set the pace for a
half then stopped when headed by the winner entering the stretch.

Footnotes
SKELLY broke on top, dueled on the outside early, eased out to a larger advantage into the turn, was given a breather through the bend, extended that
advantage under pressure past the furlong marker and was not threatened by the runner up late. TEJANO TWIST void of speed in lagging early just off the
inside, swung out to be four wide for the drive, set down, closed with good resolve to annex the place in the final strides, no threat to the winner. EXCESS
MAGIC asked away from the gate to keep up with the winner, dueled with that one up the backstretch, fell back off that rival through the bend, continued to
chase that foe into and through upper stretch, lost contact past the furlong maker, caught late for the place. MILES AHEAD in the second flight while
between horses, lacked a closing punch the final furlong. JAXON TRAVELER in the second flight while racing in the two path, had little left for the stretch
run. EDGE TO EDGE last to leave, moved out and advanced to race in the second group while four wide into and through the turn, retreated down the
stretch.

Footnotes
ALVA STARR broke on top, angled toward the inside, shook clear into the stretch, not threatened to the wire under steady handling. ROYAL SPA last to
leave, lacked speed while off the inside, swung out to be five wide into the stretch, closed well to annex the place, not a threat to the winner.
CONDENSATION forwardly placed while four wide up the backstretch and into the turn, fell back and angled in a bit through the turn, moved back out four
wide into the stretch, outkicked for the second spot while edging clear of the others. LET'S BE CLEAR fell back to trail after the start, three to four wide into
the stretch, displayed some mild interest well out in the strip to improve position. ADALINE JULIA in mid pack early, fell back through the turn in the two
path, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. CHANDANA remained back while saving ground to no avail,. MISS ARLINGTON prompted the
pace while racing three wide for a half, gave way the final furlong. HIGH CLASS pressed the issue up front in the two path, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MYSTIK DAN dropped inside to save some ground early in the first turn, behind the leaders up the backstretch, continued to save ground into the second
bend, patiently handled, slipped through along the inside to challenge entering the stretch, quickly drew clear, won geared down late in a sharp effort. JUST
STEEL forwardly placed outside, continued to stalk the middle half, took over in the three path turning for home, offered little resistance to the winner a
furlong out, fully extended to preserve the place. LIBERAL ARTS lacked early foot, continued unhurried in the run up the backstretch, moved closer in some
traffic late second turn, angled three wide for the drive, closed willingly, too late for the place. AWESOME ROAD five wide into the first turn, continued
outside, four to five wide through the second bend, improved position while widest through the stretch. COMMON DEFENSE lacked early foot, picked way
through some traffic to improve into the lane, flattened out a bit the final furlong. OTTO THE CONQUEROR away well, showed the way into the first turn,
continued to set the pace up the backstretch and into the far turn, allowed the winner the inside entering the stretch then began to weaken when headed by
that one and the runner up. CARBONE pressured the leader off the inside, continued closest to that one far turn, gave way when the real running began at
the head of the lane. LINEBACKER settled off the pace while four wide first turn, remained outside and was four wide again through the second turn, lacked
a closing response. CHARLESTON broke back and was never a threat. MAGIC GRANT last away, trailed most of the way to be always outrun.
WYNSTOCK forwardly placed, tapped on the breaks in some traffic a half mile out, stopped into the lane and trailed home.

Footnotes
MACHINE GUN MAN broke on top, showed the way into and through the first turn, continued to set the pace the middle half mile, turned back a bid from
closest pursuer turning for home, slowly increased advantage under steady handling. POLTERER behind the pace inside, continued to stalk while saving
ground through the second turn, moved out a bit past the furlong under a firm left handed crop, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clearly second
best. ALEXANDER HELIOS pressed the winner from the outside, advanced and tried that one late in the final turn, proved no match for that one in the drive
or the runner up, lasted for the show. TEN DAYS LATER dropped inside first turn, began to move closer through the second turn, angled four wide into the
stretch, managed a mild rally while not posing a serious threat to the top three. NEXT REVOLT turned in an even effort while saving ground.
PLEDGEOFALLEGIANCE five wide into the first turn, angled in to be two to three wide second bend, failed to mount a rally. ELUSIVE TARGET went one
paced in the two path throughout. WOODCOCK FLIGHT (IRE) forwardly placed for six furlongs in the three path, gave way in the drive. CHROME BABY off
a step slow, remained back in lacking a rally. TIRICO moved out to be four wide through the first turn, continued wide, four to five wide second bend, backed
up through the stretch. CATDADDY off slow, trailed throughout.
