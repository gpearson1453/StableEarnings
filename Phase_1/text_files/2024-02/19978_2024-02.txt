Footnotes
MYSTIC SUNRISE bobbled at the start and bumped with an outer foe, chased in the three path, was roused from the two path early into the turn, swung out
to the five path to bid at the top of the stretch, took the lead while tipping into the three path passing the eighth pole, and edged clear. LEXI'S SPIRIT stalked
inside, was cued approaching the quarter, bid from the two path into the lane, but was second best. SUPER SPIN set the pace in the two path, floated out to
the four path while losing the lead at the top of the stretch, but kept on to secure show. MISS UPROAR prompted the pace in the four path but faded from
the six path in the stretch. TIZ ERIN bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path but made no impact from the seven path down
the lane. LTE STARK WINTER rated inside of foes but never menaced.

MACASSA stalked in the two path, waited around the far turn, bid from the rail into the final furlong, and inched past the outer pacesetter in the final
sixteenth. A RING THING set the pace in the two path, was nudged around the turn, dug in to try to fight off an inner rival passing the eighth pole, but was
edged out in the final sixteenth to place. ANDIE ONE settled around the first turn to track in the three path down the backstretch, was coaxed into the far
turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. WHAT A KNOCKOUT raced off the pace in the two path, was cued midway
around the far turn, but made no impact from the three path in the stretch. MYSTIC DREAMS laid up close in the three path but weakened turning into the
stretch.

winner through the lane but could not seriously gain on that foe. BATTLING BUBBLES prompted the winner three wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch
and held well enough for the show. STARSHIP SIGRUN raced off the pace two wide and had only a mild stretch gain. PEP RALLY raced up close inside,
steadied midway around the first turn, continued to chase inside around the far turn and lacked a rally. ITRIEDSELLINGHER failed to menace while racing

Footnotes
STAT showed the way along the inside around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was cued along the inside passing the
quarter, kicked away turning into the lane, and held sway. SHARAR bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed along the inside, was roused in the two
path passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path passing the eighth pole, and bumped with an inner foe in the final sixteenth while running on to get up
for place. DEER DISTRICT laid up close in the three path, was cued to bid from the two path going into the far turn, swung back out to the three path at the
top of the lane, and kept on, but bumped with an outer foe in the final sixteenth, and was edged out late to show. BURNIN TURF stalked in the four path,
was ridden in the three path around the far turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. RAMSEY SOLUTION rated in the three path, was roused
midway around the far turn, fanned out to the six path turning into the stretch, but failed to bid. LEGACY ISLE bumped with an outer foe at the start, then
steadied going into the first turn, tracked in the two path down the backside, but had to steady while weakening turning into the lane.

Footnotes
LUNAR ROCKET set the pace in the two path, stayed on the left in upper stretch, switched over leaving the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging
and held clear. TOSCANITO raced up close between foes down the backstretch, steadied leaving the half-mile pole, chased two wide while in traffic around
the turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and ran on for the place. APOCALYPSO prompted the pace three wide, switched back to the left lead in
midstretch and faded while holding well enough for the show. JOE DI BAGGIO steadied leaving the half-mile pole, raced in range four wide and lacked a
closing bid. KINGPIN raced up close inside, angled three wide in upper stretch and tired. VERRAZANOINTHESKY threw his head at the start to get away
well last and trailed while racing well off the rail.

Footnotes
AVATAL HERO trailed in the four path, came under right handed encouragement midway around the turn, swung from the four path into the stretch, and
rallied past an inner foe in the closing stages. FLIRTINI set the pace in the three path, was cued approaching the quarter, opened up slightly along the
inside while on her left lead in upper stretch, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. NO ACTION pressed in the four path, was coaxed passing the
quarter, and kept on in the two path down the lane to split show. GREEK MOJO chased in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn,
but got stymied in upper stretch, tipped out to the five path around the sixteenth, and stayed on to get up for a share of show honors. IT'S NORA NOW had
to steady early raced off the pace inside, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but made no impact. PATRIA tracked in the two path but
weakened along the rail turning into the stretch. CAJUN FANTASY prompted the pace in the five path but gaveway turning into the lane.

EYES ON TARGET rated along the inside, but got stymied from the rail rounding the far turn, was roused from the three path into the stretch, and kicked on
to get up in the final strides. SMITHWICK'S SPICE showed the way around the first turn to set the pace along the inside into the backstretch, was cued
around the five-sixteenths, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, drifted out against right handed encouragement while digging in passing the
eighth pole, and was caught by an inner foe late to place. CADET CORPS trailed in the three path, was driven from the four path into the far turn, fanned out
to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for show. SONIC SPEED tracked in the two path, was coaxed along the inside midway around the far
turn, but faded from the two path down the lane. TATANKA settled outside of the pacesetter around the first turn to lay up close in the three path down the
backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, but got herded out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and flattened. YOU TALKIN TO ME raced off
the pace in the three path, got stuck in traffic while between foes in the two path midway around the far turn, was roused from the three path into the lane,
but made no impact. MAILMAN MONEY stalked in the four path, was roused while three wide going into the far turn, but had to steady while being floated
out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and could not make a bid.
