Footnotes
POKER ALICE ceded the early lead, was well placed while saving ground through the backstretch run, got in a bit tight midway through the second turn,
saved ground to the quarter marker and was asked for run into the stretch, took command and kicked clear at the furlong marker, drew off in the final
sixteenth and was hand urged in deep stretch as much the best. CLICKING tracked the decent pace from the inside,saved ground while not far back into the
second turn, was no match for the winner in the stretch drive and outfinished ALMOST GOT LUCKY in the final stages to secure place honors. ALMOST
GOT LUCKY assumed command along the first turn, set moderate fractions while off of the rail through the backstretch run, showed the way two wide into
the far turn, was overtaken into upper stretch and was outkicked at the furlong pole,weakened in the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while
clear of the rest for third. SANTALUZ DREAM tracked the early pace from a three wide position, stalked the moderate pace from the outside through the
backstretch run, mounted a three wide at the quarter marker, was outrun into the stretch and tired in the final furlong. KLOE'S LADYBUG was unhurried in
the early stages trailed to the half-mile pole and was steered three wide into the far turn, drifted to the five path into upper stretch and did not factor. ANNA'S
GIRL was allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, maintained a two wide path into the far turn, could not muster a response at mid-stretch and
gave way.

Footnotes
TWELVE VOLT tracked the moderate early pace from a two to three wide position, was well placed through the backstretch run and was guided outside of
rivals heading into the far turn, roused three to four wide at the quarter marker and ran in pursuit to mid-stretch, closed determinedly into the final sixteenth
and confronted WE CAN in deep stretch, wore down the runner-up in the final strides and was up in time to prevail. WE CAN forwardly placed into the first
turn, was keen in the early stages and came under a snug hold into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace from the inside, came in tight
approaching the quarter marker and tipped two wide for the drive, took command into upper stretch and kicked clear at the furlong grounds, was kept to task
while leading into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from TWELVE VOLT and was tagged for the win in the final strides, while clear of the rest for place
honors. VERITAS AEQUITAS took back off of the early pace, was a bit keen into the first turn and checked in tight quarters heading to the six furlong
marker, was unhurried through the backstretch run and was guided two to three wide into the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and closed into the final
sixteenth, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and was well clear in the end for third. CRUSHER showed good early speed and assumed command
into the first turn, set modest fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, showed the way into the second turn, lost the lead into upper stretch,
chased TWELVE VOLT to the furlong grounds and gave way in the late going. SEEKET SAUCE was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the
moderate pace two wide into the backstretch run, attended to the pace heading to the half-mile pole and raced close up while two to three wide into the far
turn, could not keep pace into the stretch run and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
LIGHT THE BEAM was allowed to settle while not far back in the early running, tracked the contentious pace from the inside heading to the half-mile
marker, was taken outside of rivals entering the turn and loomed three wide at the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper stretch and held a narrow
advantage at the furlong pole, battled with HALLISAR past mid-stretch and lost the lead nearing the sixteenth-marker, came again into deep stretch and
prevailed in the final strides for a determined win. HALLISAR was prominent leaving the start and pressed the decent early pace from the inside, came
under a snug hold entering the turn and steadied at the three-furlong marker, waited for racing room approaching the quarter pole then tipped two wide into
upper stretch, split rivals and vied for the lead at the furlong marker, took command and held a narrow lead at the sixteenth-marker while battling LIGHT
THE BEAM, dueled gamely into deep stretch and was bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for place honors. ONE BOLD BID tracked the
contentious early pace from the outside, gained ground into the turn and mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker, raced widest into the stretch and
ran evenly while within aim approaching the furlong marker, was outkicked by the top pair into the final sixteenth and held clearly in the end for third.
BROTHER O' BRIEN was away slowly and lacked early speed, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, tipped two wide for
the drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and finished evenly. LAST BABY was asked for speed leaving the
start and assumed command in the early stages, set a pressured pace into the turn, shook free along the bend and carved out moderate fractions to the
quarter marker, led into upper stretch and was overtaken by LIGHT THE BEAM approaching the furlong grounds, could not keep pace into the final
sixteenth and tired. RIVERMARK was forwardly placed in the early running, contested the decent pace three deep heading into the turn, kept close
attendance to the pace while chasing two wide at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong. RED RAJ lost his path at
the start and was away slowly, was void of early speed and raced greenly while trailing into the turn, chased while far back heading into the stretch and did
not factor.

MOBOU settled near the back of the field through the early going, advanced along the backstretch, made a sweeping move on the far turn to a three wide
bid for the lead passing the quarter pole, did battle with LOVE CANDY for the length of the stretch and came out on the winning end of a very tight photo.
LOVE CANDY pressed the moderate pace two wide for six furlongs then went to challenge in earnest near the quarter pole, dueled on the inside of MOBOU
for the whole of the stretch and came out on the short end of the photo. UNION WAVE broke best but opted to settle off the pace, tracked well behind the
pace for a half-mile then made forward progress through the turn, swung out four wide into the stretch, was gaining steadily on the leaders but ran out of
race track. CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN settled at the rear of the field then moved a little closer through the far turn, waited inside for racing room then angled
out two to three paths in the stretch but did not have the needed response. STONE'S RIVER was sent for and gained the lead from the break then
attempted to slow down the pace down the backstretch but was pressured by LOVE CANDY to the outside, held through the far turn then gave way under
pressure passing he three-sixteenths pole and tired in the stretch. HANKS went three wide through the clubhouse turn, tracked the leaders up close in hand
to the far turn while still wide, made a tepid attempt to rally on the far turn but came up empty.

Footnotes
HONEYMOONZ OVER rated off of the fast early pace, tracked the leaders while not far back heading into the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker,
angled five wide into the stretch and was roused nearing the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, came within aim in deep stretch and surged in the
final strides to determinedly prevail. GOLDEN ALE was prominent leaving the start, engaged with WAR GAMES in the early stages and disputed a fast pace
with that runner heading into the turn, dueled through solid fractions approaching the quarter pole and assumed command into the stretch, was set down at
the furlong marker and held foes at bay into the final sixteenth, gamely battled into deep stretch and was nailed on the wire for the win, while just holding for
place honors. COASTAL JAZZ was away in good order, contested the early pace then ceded the lead and stalked the leading pair approaching the turn,
raced three wide and between runners heading to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into the stretch and re-rallied into the final sixteenth, responded to
urging in deep stretch and vied between rivals in the final strides, just missed for the win and place and was clear of the rest for show honors in a good
effort. WAR GAMES showed speed in the early running and contested the fast pace inside of a pair of rivals, dueled into the turn and carved out solid
fractions approaching the quarter pole, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, could not match strides into the final sixteenth and
faded. YES HE CAN stalked the fast early pace from the outside, raced four wide into the turn and chased the leaders to the quarter marker, swung widest
into the stretch, lost ground at the furlong marker and could not muster a late rally. MOODY JIM (IRE) stumbled sharply at the start and lost the rider, was
caught following the race and walked off under his own power. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING MOODY JIM.
THE STEWARDS DETERMINED MOODY JIM CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AT THE START, STUMBLED AND LOST THE RIDER AND THERE WOULD
BE NO CHANGE TO ORDER OF FINISH.

BERRY VALLEY rated off of the fast early pace while not far back, tracked the quick fractions two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive
and loomed approaching mid-stretch, battled with YOU GO GIRL into the final sixteenth, repelled the runner-up in deep stretch and held safely in a drive to
prevail. YOU GO GIRL was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the fast early pace from the outside and raced three to four wide into the turn, pressed
the solid pace to the quarter marker then was asked for more into the stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong grounds and met the bid of BERRY
VALLEY past mid-stretch, battled into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and bested RAVEN'S QUEST in the final strides to earn place
honors. RAVEN'S QUEST showed good early speed and assumed command leaving the start, set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out fast fractions
while pressed to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch then came under pressure at the furlong grounds, battled into the final sixteenth, yielded in
the late stages and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third. STRANGE ADDICTION tracked the fast early pace while between rivals,
chased three wide to the quarter marker, shifted inside nearing the top of the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, could not muster a late response
and finished evenly. CITY GLITTER tracked the fast early pace between runners, chased four wide to the quarter marker and maintained that four wide path
into the stretch, ran evenly to the furlong pole and did not offer a late response. WESTWARD BREEZE tracked the fast pace while widest in the early
stages, chased five wide into the turn and ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, was outrun to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the final stages. ICONIC
SKY hustled leaving the start and was prominent in the early running, pressed the fast pace while between runners heading into the turn, maintained a two
to three wide path into the bend and pressed the solid fractions to the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, lacked
a late response and tired in deep stretch.

responded to urging approaching the sixteenth-marker and overtook TAPALO into deep stretch, was kept to task in the final strides and held safely in a
drive to prevail. TAPALO was forwardly placed leaving the start, was floated out approaching the first turn and raced five wide at the seven-furlong marker,
recovered and stalked the early pace two wide into the backstretch run, was well placed approaching the half-mile marker and assumed command into the
far turn, was confronted at the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong pole, was put to firm urging while under
pressure nearing the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by ENDLESSLY in deep stretch and outfinished the rest to be second best. GUY NAMED JOE broke
a bit slowly and was allowed to settle in the early stages, saved ground into the backstretch run and was content to trail to the half-mile marker, was taken
outside of rivals heading into the second turn and was asked for run four wide at the quarter pole, rallied at the furlong marker, could not make headway on
the top pair in deep stretch and held clearly at the finish for show honors. OLD TRIANGLE settled while not far back to begin, maintained a two wide path
through the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile pole, was roused approaching the second turn, split rivals at the three-furlong marker and
challenged TAPALO nearing the top of the lane, was repelled in that effort and was outkicked heading to mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final
sixteenth and did not offer a final response. GROGU was allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the first turn and maintained an inside path
through the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn, was gaining approaching the quarter marker then steadied hard while in tight quarters
nearing that station, lost ground into the stretch and flattened out in the late stages. COME OUT FIGHTING broke alertly and was prominent away from the
start, saved ground into the first turn and vied for the lead in the early stages, ceded to WILD JEWELS heading into the backstretch run and raced close up
to the decent pace approaching the half-mile pole, lost position into the second turn and chased to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch
and gave way in the final furlong. ARCTIC BREEZE showed early speed and was forwardly placed leaving the start, came in tight while between runners
approaching the first turn and was floated four wide nearing the seven-furlong marker, recovered into the first turn and stalked the pace from the inside
heading into the backstretch run, tracked the decent pace while between runners nearing the half-mile marker, was outrun along the second turn and tired in
the stretch drive. WILD JEWELS hustled away from the start, vied for the early lead while hard to place and floated out a pair of rivals entering the first turn,
contested the pace three wide along the first turn and assumed command into the backstretch run, set the pace while widest approaching the half-mile pole,
lugged out into the second turn and lost position at the quarter marker, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
LORD WIMBORNE (IRE) raced mid-pack to the outside of POUR ON THE COLE to the half, started a bid from the seven-sixteenths pole in tandem with
that rival but took the three wide path around the far turn then swung five wide into the stretch, ran on strongly down the middle of the track under a brisk
hand ride and was along in time. POUR ON THE COLE bobbled at the start then got forced inward by TEX HANLEY a few strides out, recovered nicely and
settled mid-pack on the rail for the first half-mile, launched a rally from the seven-sixteenths marker, neatly slipped through an opening between horses near
the three-sixteenths pole, responded with a nice run under steady handling but could not hold off the winner in the final yards. DESERT DUDE was hustled
from the outside, allowed JERRY JEFF WALKER to dictate the pace while content to stalk from a length or so behind, went to put some pressure on near
the hafl-mile pole, then went to challenge in earnest near the three furlong marker, battled the resilient rival to the stretch, gained a short lead passing the
furlong pole but was unable to fend of the top pair. TEX HANLEY veered in after the break and forced POUR ON THE COLE into DARK MYSTERY, tracked
the pacesetters from the inside to the far turn, moved to challenge from the three-furlong pole but was unable to catch up to the leaders, kept to task under
heavy pressure and was able to hold position to the line. WALKING BOSS was not asked for speed from the break, held the rail and settled at the back
through the first turn, was still last going into the far turn, started an extended rally with about three furlongs to run, swung out out to the four path for the
stretch run and kept on with grinding finish to the wire. WILL IS CHILL allowed to settle, raced in the back half of the strung out field, launched a rally on the
far turn keeping to the rail, tipped out a path near the eighth pole but flattened out and could not find the needed response. JERRY JEFF WALKER broke
out at the break but was sent hard for forward position, was first into the turn and led the field to the backstretch run, tried to open up but was being
pressured to the outside by DESERT DUDE who was a constant shadow to the three furlong marker, came under a ride at that point and fought that rival
gamely to mid-stretch then weakened before the furlong marker. CALI CONQUEST came out of the gate sideways then was bumped lightly by DARK
MYSTERY as part of a chain reaction that started from the outside posts, allowed to settle inside near the back of the field remained to the inside through
the far turn and held position while never improving. DARK MYSTERY was restless in the gate, stumbled slightly a the start, then got pinballed a few yards
after the break, settled two wide through the first turn near the rear, attempted to rally through the far turn and came five to six wide into the stretch but could
not make up any ground and was protected through the final furlong. BROKEN FINGER pulled the rider three wide through the first turn then tracked the
pace still wide down the backstretch, came under pressure with three furlongs to run and started to get surrounded and passed by the field near the
five-sixteenths pole, had no response, was not persevered with and galloped home behind the field.
