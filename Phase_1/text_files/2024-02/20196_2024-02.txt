Footnotes
CRIMSON STORM tracked along the inside, bid outside of the top pair nearing the lane and drew off. UNCLE NICK pursued from midpack in the three path,
came under urging in the four path around the far turn and ran on to reach place at the wire. TIME TO MEDDLE broke through the gate pre-race, showed
the way along the inside, met a pair of outer bids turning for home, got headed by his widest challenger entering the lane, held place into deep stretch but
was caught at the wire. PAYOFF CYCLE stalked outside of the pace setter, bid along with an outer looming for at the quarter pole, got outkicked by that one
entering the lane and gave way. FABLED RULER lacked speed shifting from the two to five path around the first turn, got hung in the six path around the far
turn, shifted inwardly entering upper stretch and failed to menace. BUTLER CABIN settled off of the pace in the three to four path, but lacked a response to
urging in the five path around the far turn and made little impact. BELLA'S GATSBY got fractious in the gate when an inner rival broke through it, then
fidgeted just before the gates sprung and broke multiple lengths slow, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
PIP SQUEEK broke a step slow before getting slammed by an outer rival into an inner foe and pinched back at the start, settled well back in the three path,
moved out to the six path in upper stretch and rallied to sweep past the tiring leading pair in the final sixteenth. MONI DESIGN stalked along the inside,
moved inside of the leader to prompt passing the three furlong pole, but backed out of that position when put to a bit of tight quarters at the five sixteenths
pole, tipped to re-take aim outside of the leader entering upper stretch, offered a mild bid entering the final sixteenth but got outkicked by a wider challenger
and edged place. ASTROLOGY GIRL set the pace two wide as an inner rival pressed into the turn, subtly put to that one to narrow quarters before shaking
clear entering the lane, managed to hold sway into the final furlong while tiring and hanging on her left lead, but was caught in the final sixteenth, weakened
and lost place late. SARAH'S COURT broke inwardly and bothered inner rivals at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then chased
evenly through the lane. COUNTRY BELLE was put to crowded quarters by an outer foe and forced into an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace five
wide, got outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch and lacked a bid. REAL DEAL RYAN broke a step slow before taking strong contact from an outer rival at
the start, trailed along the inside and surpassed outer tiring rivals. EUROSTORM chased from midpack along the inside and faded, between horse. READY
FOR THUNDER was jostled between horses at the start, pursued from midpack in the four path and tired between horses. MISS NIMBUS broke outwardly
at the start, stalked three wide and weakened on her left lead.

vied among foes while exchanging light contact with an inner rival into the final furlong, but brushed with foes on either side at the sixteenth pole and yielded

Footnotes
WON DAY showed the way inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one around the turn, maintained an advantage in upper stretch, then shifted out slightly
while shaking free nearing the final sixteenth. SAINT EROS GIRL bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed the eventual winner from the outside, vied
around the turn, but failed to sustain the battle while while flopping back to her left lead nearing the final sixteenth and was second best. FOR REAL ALICE
was reluctant to load, tracked along the inside, gained show from an outer rival nearing the lane, shifted out in upper stretch, but only managed to chase
while hanging on her left lead through the final furlong, yet saved show from an inner bidder at the wire. WAIT ON ME bumped with an outer rival at the
start, raced at the rear towards the inside, entered the lane two wide, split foes in upper stretch launching a rally, progressed to offer an inside show bid in
the closing stages but narrowly missed. COMMERCIAL FLASH chased from midpack in the four path and failed to menace between foes. ZERO POINT
ZERO trailed two wide, entered the lane in the four path and improved position. LILY'S WOOFY failed to factor from the five path. FIRINGTOTHEFRONT
stalked outside of the top pair and faded turning for home. CARSON'S PRINCESS broke slowly, lacked speed in the six path before tucking behind foes and
to the rail at the three furlong pole, then saved ground thereafter and made little impact.

Footnotes
MI SOLUTION stalked two wide, bid turning for home, dueled with the early-pace setter while forging an advantage in upper stretch, then drove clear late.
KNOCKALITTLELOUDER dictated terms along the inside, met an outer challenge turning for home, got headed in upper stretch, sustained the battle
through midstretch, but yielded late and lasted for place. TONTERIA lacked speed in the two path, advanced in the four path around the far turn, drifted
inwardly in upper stretch, rallied between horses into the final furlong and sustained progress to miss reaching place. RELENTLESS DANCER bumped with
an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside, then from the two path around the far turn, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, but only
managed to chase thereafter and lacked a bid. SMARTY ALEX broke a step slow and bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide,
shifted out to the fie to six path in upper stretch and ran on to reach a minor reward late. AFLEET ASCENT tracked three wide, pursued in the four to five
path in upper stretch but failed to threaten. GUITARTUITION PLZZ settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and failed to factor.
SINGLE SHOT saved ground in midpack, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before giving way. SNAKEBIT steadied among foes soon after the
start, then was outrun along the inside. CHARLIE G pursued from midpack two wide, but lacked a response to urging in the three path around the far turn
and faded.

Footnotes
KAHALA bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the five path around the first turn, moved down to the three path at the five furlong
pole, inched closer between horses before taking aim outside of the top pair turning for home, bid three deep entering the lane, forged a narrow advantage
in upper stretch and edged clear late. LUKE prompted outside of the leader, bid along with an outer rival entering the lane, sparred with that one in the final
furlong but was bested. FIRST CLASS HARLOW set the pace a bit off of the rail as an outer rival applied pressure, got headed by a pair of foes in upper
stretch, gave way and lasted for show. PATH TO SUCCESS was bumped between horses, put to crowded quarters and steadied back at the start, lacked
speed shifting out to the three path around the first turn, advanced in the five path around the far turn, then ran on while flopping leads multiple times, and
missed show. JAYS HOLIDAY pursued two wide, moved to track behind the leaders around the far turn, chased in upper stretch and faded. SOUTH SIDE
saved ground off of the pace and failed to rally between horses. TARAASHOQ pursued from midpack in the two path, but yielded between horses at the five
furlong pole and made little impact thereafter. HE GOTS TO GO stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path, but faded between horses around the
far turn. CATCHIN DRAMA bumped an inner rival at the start, trailed in the three to four path and got outrun.

Footnotes
DUSTIN THE DIAMOND tracked along the inside, tipped out in upper stretch to blow by the weakening leader at the furlong grounds and kicked clear.
BRIE'S MISSION bumped with an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, gained show from outer rivals before shifting out inside the three
sixteenths pole, then ran on along with an outer rival to gain place late. GOTTA KEEP HIM pursued from midpack two to three wide, floated to the six path
entering the lane and ran on willingly to reach show late. THEPLAINS MARSHALL dueled for the lead with an outer rival through a fast early pace, inherited
a large advantage after his counterpart faltered down the backstretch, but began to tire entering the lane, was overhauled by an outer bidder at the furlong
grounds and weakened. SHARP SPARK pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted to the four path and between horses entering the lane and ran on
mildly. FREE DROP ROB tracked from the three path, drifted to the five path and between horses entering the lane and yielded. STORM FORCE saved
ground off of the pace, but to no avail. RAINBOW MAN broke a step slow, trailed around both turns and never got involved. HOWARD'S GRIT dueled for
the lead two wide while opening up on the rest of the field approaching the first turn, but weakened with nine sixteenths to go and stopped. STRONG
DIAMOND bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from the four path and faded around the far turn.

CHAMPLIN showed the way along the inside, cleared in upper stretch inched away from chasers under little urging. MESA SPIRIT stalked along the inside,
edged place from outer rivals entering midstretch and was second best. ZIPPIN GIGI tracked three wide, bid for place whlie chasing the clearing leader in
upper stretch, but was outkicked for that position nearing the furlong grounds. CASH FEVER stalked two wide, but failed to sustain pressure entering the
lane and gradually yielded between horses. CAMP DADDY pursued four wide but lacked the needed punch to offer a bid. CALIBRACHOA KID chased from
midpack two wide and between horses, then failed to menace. MACHO FORTY FIVE saved ground off of the pace, shifted out leaving upper stretch and
failed to factor. VOYANT broke a step slow and was taken back at the start, trailed in the three to six path and got outrun.

Footnotes
GENEROUS LOVER stalked along the inside, pursued with run from the pocket around the far turn, took aim outside of the clear leader in midstretch, bid
two wide at the sixteenth pole and drew clear. CLASSIC CLAIRE set the pace along the inside, shook clear in upper stretch, but was bested by an outer
bidder at the sixteenth pole and lasted for place. LUCKY SPEECH tracked three wide, chased in the four path into the final furlong and ran on willingly to
miss reaching place. NOT TODAY GEEGEE stalked two wide, but yielded in the three path and between horses at the furlong grounds. LIFFEY laid off of
the pace two to three wide, awaited racing room turning for home, shfited to the four path entering upper stretch and ran on while one-paced. DONA WITCH
veered in at the start and was off slow as the rider had to correct to avoid the inner railing, saved ground at the rea and improved inside of rivals in upper
stretch. LOCK IT UP broke a step slow and took contact from an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear in the three to two paths around the turns and
made little impact. PLAYMATE laid off of the pace three to four wide, shifted to the five path entering upper stretch and gave way. CHASING SUMMER
stumbled and bumped an outer rival while awkward to recover, laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued between horses around the far turn, but
weakened and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
ANITA'S VISION stalked in the four path, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel with the pace-setter, sparred through the late stages and prevailed. R T'S
GEM set the pace inside of a vying rival, dug in to resist a wider challenge in upper stretch, dueled gamely through the late stages but was grudgingly
bested. MO SMOKING stalked along the inside, aimed to bid between the top pair in upper stretch, altered course outside of them in midstretch, then
chased them home while needing more. DREWSILLA raced at the rear in the three path, advanced between horses turning for home before tipping to the
five path in upper stretch, and moved up while one paced. SHES A LUCKY REBEL broke outwardly, vied for the lead with an inner rival while in the three
path and yielded between horses in upper stretch. SMART IZZY saved grund off of the pace to no avail. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE pursued two wide and
lacked a bid. GUITAR WOMAN laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, steadily faded down the backstretch and made litlte impact. SKY
HIGH SUSAN pursued five wide and faded around the far turn.
