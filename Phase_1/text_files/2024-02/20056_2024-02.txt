to the wire. NEW SPELL good position to the half with an outside run into the far turn with a bid, could not keep on in the stretch outkicked. MONEY
MEMOLO inside run to far turn, kept on in the stretch for show spot. GERICAULT slow into stride, saved ground to far turn, improved late going.
MONTEVALLO dueled inside to stretch, folded in the late going. BROTHER RICE was awkward from the gate, bore out into first turn bothering rival and
never menaced. WICKED MELODY inside duel to far turn with nothing left in the stretch run. MR. MELO good position to the half, dueled far turn, gave way
stretch run. COASTING BY tried to keep up to the half with nothing left and dropped back.
