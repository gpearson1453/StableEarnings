Footnotes
MARYLAND MOON lacked speed down the backstretch, raced in the two path between horses on the turn, swung four wide leaving the turn, closed steadily
outside horses and was up in time. KING COVEE stalked the pace, advanced three deep on the turn, took the lead and went clear in mid stretch then gave
way grudgingly. ENERGY EFFICIENT disputed the pace outside INSPIRED IRISH, remained prominent through the stretch and faded late. I KNOW , along
the inner rail on the turn, angled out in upper stretch, worked between horses and needed more. SOVEREIGN CAUSE , a forward factor along the inner rail
on the turn, moved out for the drive, raced between horses and failed to rally. INSPIRED IRISH hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace and weakened.
SUCCEED was no factor. HIALEAH NATIVE , three wide into the turn, was fanned five wide turning for home and faltered.

Footnotes
EL DE LARRY broke sharply, rated kindly in range while saving ground, was stalled a bit leaving the three eighths, eased out and responded to asking past
the five sixteenths, split rivals nearing the lane, dropped back to the rail and closed in under strong handling, slipped through to challenge in mid stretch,
gained command a sixteenth out and edged away while kept alert. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN tracked two wide behind the leaders, worked his way between
runners leaving the far turn, forged to a clear lead after six furlongs, spurted away entering the lane, was hooked from his inside in mid stretch, dueled past
the sixteenth marker and stayed on well to be clear for the place. ASCENDANCE stumbled at the break, regrouped and edged up three wide between
runners mid way through the backstretch run, took closer order four wide past the three furlong marker, pursued the leader to mid stretch then came up
empty in the final sixteenth. CHICA CHUCK was taken back soon after the break, lost ground four wide while advancing to the five furlong marker, saw the
leaders get away a bit leaving the far turn, chased wide into the stretch but lacked a bid. JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH , reluctant to load, broke slowly, was
sent up three wide and cleared past the seven eighths, dropped in to set the pace, ceded command past the three eighths and faltered. PRINCE FRED ,
two wide prompting the pace outside JUMPINGJAGGERFLASH, shifted three wide nearing the far turn, failed to keep pace leaving the five sixteenths and
falltered.

Footnotes
BANDITS WARRIOR took over early, set a rated pace off the rail while handling some inside pressure, spurted clear near the three eighths, was nursed
along three wide into the lane, kept on under hand urging near mid stretch, was asked twice right handed through the final furlong, was joined from her
outside in the yards and got the perfect bob to prevail. FOOL YOURSELF settled four wide outside rivals into the turn, angled out a bit and gained five wide
nearing the lane, straightened away and made a grinding run under pressure, drew alongside in deep stretch and lost the bob. TWEET AWAY ROBIN
prompted the pace inside the winner into the turn, eased out a bit after that one cleared then gave hard chase, raced two wide with pursuit near mid stretch
and kept on with effort. FANCY PRINCESS , off slow when breaking awkwardly, moved up two wide outside a rival mid turn, dropped to the rail and
progressed past mid stretch then flattened out. IRISH LACE broke slowly, settled off the inside, swung five wide for the drive and rallied. MATOULA saved
ground and failed to generate a solid finish. THEA'S THEME rated close up between rivals, was under pressure three wide into the lane and faded.
MYSISTERNANCY rated inside while in range the opening three sixteenths, was shuffled back to last around the far turn, swung seven wide for the drive
but lacked a rally. ALAS AND ALACK , three wide between rivals, failed to kick on nearing the lane and tired. LUNITA , four wide outside rivals, forced the
pace to the head of the lane then gave way.

Footnotes
ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, was always clear and held sway under steady handling. GREAT HEAVENS
saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out in upper stretch then gamely chased the winner through the stretch. MIDNIGHT RENEGADE saved
ground on the turn under urging, remained along the rail in the stretch and passed tired rivals. DISPUTED CLAIM broke a bit awkwardly, steadied in traffic
entering the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch and offered a mild gain. HEMP , in the two path chasing the winner around the turn, weakened
through the stretch. GOODAFTERNOONOSCAR , wide on the turn, gave way. NOAH CHANCE , three wide chasing the early pace, faltered.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT ICE rated off the inside while not far back, took closer order between rivals leaving the far turn, was patiently handled behind foes nearing the
lane, eased out and closed in under strong handling between horses past the furlong grounds, dueled on near even terms through the final sixteenth,
gained a slim lead late and narrowly prevailed. VICTIM OF THE NITE pulled clear early and set rated pace, came two wide for the drive, drifted out a bit
clinging to the advantage under a drive past mid stretch, dug in when engaged by two foes to his outside, switched over to his left lead a sixteenth out, kept
on valiantly but just missed. UNDER THE RADAR tracked the leader while about three wide, remained in touch under coaxing past the three eighths, shifted
out some and moved up to threaten leaving mid stretch, sparred with the top pair to his inside, kept on with good energy but wasn't quite good enough.
AMITY ROAD rated off the inside while not too far back, advanced four wide between rivals around the turn, gave hard chase of the embattled leaders
leaving mid stretch but came up empty. HAY CHIEF , sluggish from the gate, lagged back leaving the far turn, came four wide with some momentum into
the lane, angled out past the quarter pole, altered in through the final furlong and was going well late. CROSSLAND rated close between runners through
the backstretch run, shifted in around the turn, had aim into the lane, failed to kick on under pressure leaving mid stretch and faded. AMPERSAND dwelt at
the break spotting the field multiple lengths, gained off the rail mid turn, came four wide for the drive, failed to sustain near mid stretch and gave way. JOHN
HALL settled off the pace, saved ground into and through the lane but lacked a solid kick. FOLE'S NOTION lost ground five wide most of the way, made a
threatening run into the stretch, failed to kick on past the quarter pole and weakened. CHELONIAN prompted inside early on, eased back a bit into the turn,
moved off the rail and was put to pressure mid turn, lacked a punch in upper stretch and weakened. AIN'T WASTING TIME , four wide, dropped back
leaving the far turn. MARGIE'S FUN SON , four to five wide stalking the pace, failed to kick on mid turn, began getting out soon after and faltered.

Footnotes
LIQUIDATOR raced along the inner rail around the turn while stalking the pace, eased out to the three path at the head of the stretch, remained on her left
lead until the sixteenth pole, closed outside the leader and was up approaching the finish. ROYAL SEAMSTRESS set the pace in the two path around the
turn, opened up in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. GENIEINABRIDLE , a forward factor three deep leaving the turn, lacked the necessary rally.
ANGEL ART , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. CHICKAHOMINY raced along the inner rail throughout and was no
factor. GOLDIENESS bore in when breaking very awkwardly, failed to be a factor and raced in the three path on the turn. MOONBOOTS , in the two path
between horses on the turn ,gave way in the stretch. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA was outrun. IRISH COCO , four wide on the turn, was outrun.

CHARMING WAY broke a beat slow, quickly recovered and moved up four wide to contention around the first turn, was confidently handled four wide
through the backstretch run, dropped in a bit and took command near the three eighths, spurted clear while still in hand, responded when put to pressure
and opened up past the three sixteenths, drifted out despite efforts with right handed asks and held sway. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO rated off foes into the first
turn then settled off the inside, moved up under a ride leaving the far turn, gave hard chase two wide into the lane, worked between rivals inside the furlong
grounds then churned on to the inside of I CAN RUN to earn the place. I CAN RUN , off a bit slow, settled off the early pace, came under a ride and picked
up momentum four wide past the three eighths, pursued the winner into the lane, drifted in from a right handed ask nearing mid stretch, corrected and
continued on with effort. KNICKERSINATWIST , inside a pair of rivals while dueling around the first turn, emerged in a battle to the inside of PHAROAHS
BABY GYAL leaving the three quarter pole, held a slim lead into the far turn, stayed on to chase the winner while staying towards the rail into the lane,
remained a willing presence to the sixteenth marker then faded. PEYTON ELIZABETH dueled between rivals around the first turn and into the backstretch,
eased back to stalk, failed to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and faltered through the drive. ALWAYS LAUGHING broke awkwardly, recovered and
dropped in towards the rail in early backstretch, gained into the far turn, failed to kick on under a ride near the five sixteenths and tired. PHAROAHS BABY
GYAL rushed up and vied three deep around the first turn, dropped in a path and disputed the pace outside KNICKERSINATWIST through the backstretch,
failed to go on leaving the half mile marker, faltered and was eased in the drive.

Footnotes
OURNATIONONPARADE lacked speed, rushed up four deep leaving the turn to challenge for the lead, battled to mid stretch then asserted himself and
drew clear late. NO CENTS stalked the early pace, advanced in the two path between horses to bid for the lead leaving the turn, battled inside the winner
and finished gamely while second best. KARAN'S NOTION , four wide on the turn, moved to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside rivals. SWILL
showed speed inside horses, saved ground around the turn and weakened in the drive. THREES OVER DEUCES raced along the inner rail on the turn,
eased out for the drive and failed to rally. BOURBON MUSIC chased the pace inside horses on the turn, raced near the inner rail in the stretch and steadied
lacking room near the eighth pole and inside the sixteenth pole. EXCULPATORY showed speed in the three path and faltered leaving the turn.

Footnotes
NO EASY DAYS drafted back soon after the break and settled off of a contested pace, was given his cue and responded four wide leaving the three
eighths, quickly gained under a ride and bid three deep approaching the stretch, took over leaving the three sixteenths, battled for a bit with NOTTOWAY
then eagerly moved away while kept to task. NOTTOWAY gained command in hand and between runners heading to the half mile marker, handled outside
pressure around the turn, battled inside the winner from the head of the lane to mid stretch, faded but had enough left to save the place. STRUGAR ,
coaxed along inside to hold a forward spot, shifted out three to four wide soon into the stretch and churned on. HIS NAME IS SUE , five wide outside rivals
nearing the half, vied three wide outside NOTTOWAY leaving the five sixteenths, failed to go on leaving mid stretch and weakened. HE HATE ME , off the
pace while saving ground, swung out five wide for the drive and offered a belated rally. HEADS OR TAILS vied between foes early, eased back off the
leaders leaving the far turn, shifted out for the drive and faded. DYNAMITE KARMA vied two wide between runners heading to the half, drafted back off the
leaders, chased and faded. PRESSING CONCERN , four wide and between rivals contesting the early pace, failed to kick on past the three eighths, faltered
and was eased through the lane. FIZBO angled in early and settled outside a rival, lost his action nearing the quarter pole, was pulled up in upper stretch
and walked off.
