STONE'S THROW quick to the front well handled to stretch, impressive effort. CHARGE THE CASTLE inside run to turn never far back, no match for
winner. ELM STREET unhurried to turn, rallied along in the stretch for show spot. THICK AS THIEVES inside run while back to the turn, improved position
late going. ILLINI no hurry to the turn while never a threat, off rail stretch run. HEAVY HITTER chased between horses to the stretch, weakened in the lane.
FIRE WIRE never factored throughout. MOR ZIP was through after a half and faded back in the stretch run. TOO CLOSE off rail run to the turn, backed up
in stretch, struggled in the late going.
