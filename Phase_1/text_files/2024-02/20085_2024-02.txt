Footnotes
BIG COUPE away quickly to take the lead then dueled inside a rival, drew clear from SILENT HEAT to take full control, challenged by that rival at the
seven-sixteenths pole, fought inside a trio of rivals with a quarter mile left to run, responded when called upon in the lane and gamely prevailed.
GOLDENEYE tossed his head at the start but only came away step slow, rated on the inside through the early going, continued under a hold saving ground
behind the leader on the far turn, looked to launch a bid but lacked room in upper stretch, gained an opening in the final furlong and finished gamely for
second. CLASSIC CREATION got bumped by inner rival early, stalked two then three wide, went four wide into the far turn, challenged four deep at the
quarter pole, fought into the final furlong, lacked the needed late kick but stayed on to secure third. EXPLAIN THIS AUDIT unhurried to begin and moved
inside, drew closer in the middle stages, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out into the lane, moved out further in the stretch and summoned a mild
rally. MO REWARDS traveled two wide off the pace, chased between rivals on the backstretch and far turn, spun three wide into the lane, steered out in
upper stretch and kept on while getting outkicked for the minor placings. FOR A LAUGH (IRE) brushed with outer rival early, stalked two wide, bid three
deep at the quarter pole and flattened in the final sixteenth. SILENT HEAT chased briefly then altered from behind the leader and went up to duel for
command, chased two wide midway around the clubhouse turn, challenged again from outside at the seven-sixteenths pole, fought between rivals late on
the bend and faltered in the final furlong. ST. ELMO raced outside a rival at the back in the early going, tracked three deep up the backstretch, came four
wide into the lane and had little left for the final furlong.

Footnotes
MR BIG BUCKS chased off the inside, drew closer nearing the turn, bid three then two wide around the bend, dueled outside MYSTIC SPIRIT through the
stretch and dug in to win a narrow photo. MYSTIC SPIRIT dueled from inside then inched ahead to set a pressured pace, cleared outer rival early on the
turn but was soon challenged by MR BIG BUCKS at the three-eighths pole, carried a short lead over that rival into the stretch, battled down the lane and
finished gamely in defeat. LAST CALL PAUL hustled early chasing off the rail, driven two to three wide into the lane, moved out further into the final furlong
looming outside the top pair but could not find the needed late kick. R AWESOME KID toss his head and came away slow, climbed early at the back,
advanced on the inside around the bend but could not summon the needed rally in the lane. T ONE D FLOUR FREE crowded between rivals early and
climbed before getting put in tight again between rivals in a rough early going, chased three wide into the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend,
entered the stretch three wide and failed to menace. TWILIGHT MOON raced in range along the rail into the turn, angled three wide before coming back to
the two path exiting the bend and weakened down the lane. I WILL BE KING dueled from outside then pressed up the backstretch, dropped back two then
three wide around the bend, trailed four wide into the lane, eased to the wire and walked off.

SHADY TIGER traveled near the back up the backstretch, chased along the rail then two wide leaving the turn, angled out in the stretch, rallied under left
handed urging and got up at the wire. CATMANSUE settled outside a rival, traveled two to three wide on the turn, angled out into the lane, rallied while
drifting in some in the lane, took over outside the sixteenth pole and got nailed on the line. BEER MONEY stalked three wide then two wide, tipped out
entering the stretch, bid between rivals in the furlong grounds and got outkicked. PRINCE PRANCEALOT dueled from outside, inched ahead past the
quarter pole, cleared briefly at the eighth pole but was soon challenged by outer rivals, lost command near the sixteenth pole and yielded late. WHERE IT'S
AT tracked out of range to the turn, saved ground along the inside to the stretch, altered out at the eighth pole, moved back to the inside and kept on to the
wire. STAGGER LEE broke a step slow, stalked along the inside, chased a bit off the rail into the stretch, found the rail again the lane but weakened in the
late stages. STAY ON THE FENCE broke a bit slow, trailed on the inside to the stretch, moved out in the furlong grounds and failed to make an impact.
IMMELMANN dueled from inside to the stretch, drifted into the hind-quarters of outer rival and took up at the eighth pole and weakened.

Footnotes
LETSHAVEONEMORE stalked three wide early, bid outside the leader at the three-eighths pole, took over past the five-sixteenths pole, put away inner rival
approaching the stretch and drew off under a drive. RINGTONE stalked between rivals, asked two wide on the far turn and gained the place. SENSE sent
for the lead and took control of the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, tested from outside at the three-eighths pole, relinquished the lead midway
around the bend, chased the new leader past the quarter pole, weakened in the drive but churned on to hold the show. AUDIBLE SILENCE broke a step
slow, keen early under a hold in the three path, chased four deep into the far turn, exited that bend three wide and weakened. THIRSTY LOV stalked five
wide into the clubhouse turn then moved into the four path, traveled three deep on the far turn then lost positions around the bend, remained off the rail into
the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN SPUN came away slow from inside, rushed up on heels into the first turn, remained along the fence inside rivals
into the second bend, started to weaken through the turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
LAUDATORY pulled along the inside early then settled in mid-pack, tipped two wide at the quarter pole, swung out approaching the stretch, closed under
left handed encouragement and surged late to overhaul the runner-up. TAHINI cleared and crossed over to the inside, pressured into the backstretch, held a
short lead through the far turn, shook free at the top of the lane, led clear into deep stretch and got run down late. KATHYNMARISSA broke a step slow,
stalked on the fence, ridden along at the five-sixteenths pole, chased under left handed urging in the stretch and finished willingly for third. MS
MCWHINNEY broke well then took a stalking position in the two path, applied pressure leaving the clubhouse turn, fought outside the leader through the
second bend, lost touch into the lane, stayed on in the drive and got edged for the show while gaining ground late. MOTET chased between foes early, two
wide leaving the backstretch, got floated five wide into the lane and lacked a bid. BLUE FASHION antsy in the gate, saved ground towards the rear, coaxed
along through the far turn, moved out a bit in the lane, tried to rally but lacked room and had to steady late and could not regain momentum. IMA JOKER
chased outside a rival then three deep on the clubhouse turn, remained three wide into the lane and lacked a response when called upon. RESPECT THE
CROWN pulled and had to take hold behind rivals early, chased two then three wide on the far turn and could not rally. MATTERS broke a bit slow, angled
to the inside at the back and never got involved. WYNNING TOUCH broke a step slow, traveled outside a rival at the back, rounded the far turn two then
three wide, drifted out into the lane and failed to menace.

CALIFORNIA TIGER dueled for command inside a rival early then cleared at the half-mile pole, inched away past the quarter pole, started to open up at the
top of the lane and powered away when flagged with the whip and widened under steady handling. PAT'S PADDOCK PICK raced up close outside the top
pair then chased three deep up the backstretch, remained three wide into the lane and bested the rest. HOUNDSTOOTH chased inside rivals along the rail
into and around the bend, could not make any headway on the winner in the lane and got outkicked for second. BENDETTIJOE raced in range between,
chased two wide into the turn, angled four wide around the bend and failed to threaten. STOP AND A TRES broke well then was allowed to settle, drifted
out early before being corrected, chased along the rail into the turn, eased off the fence and came three wide into the lane, angled in from behind a rival at
the eighth pole and could not rally. MEESH dueled briefly from outside then chased the winner up the backstretch, rounded the bend in the two path and
weakened. JOHN DUNBAR chased three wide into the turn, was moved out to the five path midway around the bend, spun four wide into the stretch and
came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
STAY HOT trailed inside a rival then angled outside that foe into the turn, navigated the turn three wide, steered out across the dirt, rallied four deep into the
final furlong, dueled with HEART HEADED in deep stretch and dug in to overtake that rival nearing the wire. HEART HEADED stalked two wide into the turn
then along the inside, moved out and launched a bid between rivals in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole, fought with STAY HOT late and got
edged by that rival. CHARGE FOR GOLD went up to duel from outside, kept the pressure on HEAR HEADED through the turn while two to three wide,
drifted out a bit crossing the dirt, fought three deep into the final furlong and was outkicked in deep stretch. FINAL BOSS sat off the pace in the early going,
saved ground through the turn, moved out a bit over the dirt, found the rail again in the lane and finished willingly but needed to find more late. HEDWIG
brushed by outer rival leaving the gate, dueled inside CHARGE FOR GOLD, inched ahead into the turn, maintained command into the lane, resisted to the
eighth pole, then relinquished the lead shortly after and flattened late. BOLTAGE tracked three wide into the turn, shifted to the two path around the bend,
spun three wide into the lane and lacked further response. ALWAYS ON CAY broke in and brushed HEDWIG, settled out of range in the early stages,
rounded the bend in the two path, moved out across the dirt and failed to menace.

Footnotes
PATRON D'ORO vied for the lead inside pair of rivals while off the rail, inched ahead and showed the way under pressure around the bend, shook free at
the top of the stretch and widened while kept to task to the wire. EL DIABLO ROJO was off slow to begin, raced at the back inside a rival up the backstretch,
split foes at the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane, angled out and rallied to best the rest. AFTERNOON HEAT dropped back early and
raced outside a rival, raced three wide on the turn then altered in from behind a rival to the two path midway around the bend, steered out into the clear in
the lane and summoned a mild rally to earn the show honors. MITICO bobbled slightly at the start, raced up close from inside, saved ground to the stretch
and failed to rally. HANDR'SDREAM forwardly placed outside a rival, ridden along two then three wide on the turn and lacked a bid. RUSTY B CAUSE
chased from inside to the stretch, moved out with a furlong remaining and failed to threaten. MONGOLIAN MEMORY vied for the lead between rivals to the
turn, pressed from outside around the bend, could not kick on with the leader at the quarter pole and faded down the lane. OIL CAN KNIGHT tracked four
wide into the turn, came five wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run. FAST PER SE vied three deep up the backstretch, chased the top pair
four then three wide on the turn and gave way. CONCH DADDY stumbled in the beginning, chased five wide into the turn, dropped back around the bend,
trailed six wide into the lane, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
CARIBBEAN KING stalked along the rail, took aim two wide at the quarter pole, drew alongside the leader leaving the far turn, cleared at the eighth pole
and edged away. PRECISION STRIKE bobbled at the start, settled three deep then moved into the two path on the clubhouse turn, remained two wide
through the second bend, swung five wide into the stretch and rallied for second. QUINTECENTS sprinted clear while racing keenly, steered over to the
inside, controlled the pace to the far turn, challenged by CARIBBEAN KING into the stretch, yielded to that rival in upper stretch, kept on through the final
furlong and lost second. GHOST COAST tracked the pace outside a rival, between runners at the quarter pole, asked right handed in the lane but could not
summon the needed late kick. PINEHURST (IRE) tracked along the rail out of range, chased within striking distance on the fence entering the lane and
could not produce a bid. GET KRAKEN took the first turn three then two wide and dropped back off the pace, saved ground through the far turn, angled out
in upper stretch and improved position. SIX MAGPIES (IRE) raced keenly early before settling on the inside in mid-pack, continued off the pace through the
far turn, had to alter six wide when a rival swung out leaving the bend and could not threaten in the furlong grounds. BIG JUANITO trailed on the inside
through the first turn, continued on the fence then two wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. CHROME TO RICHES saved ground towards the rear,
ridden along through the far turn and was never a factor. NOBEL GARY raced along the inside near the back, went outside a rival on the far turn, entered
the lane three wide and failed to make an impact. FINALLY AN EDDIE stalked outside a rival, coaxed along on the far turn, chased three deep into the lane
and retreated. PER RULING ECM2024-75 FROM HIWU, CARIBBEAN KING WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
