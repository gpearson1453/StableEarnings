Footnotes
LADY ABRIL pressed the pace two wide past the seven sixteenths pole, took charge entering the turn, set the balance of the pace and prevailed under
strong handling. BISCAYNE BAY stalked the pace down the backstretch, offered a mild bid two wide nearing the quarter pole then was no match for the
winner while well clear for second. DANCIN' ROSIE hit the gate and drifted out at the start, trailed down the backstretch, swung wide and passed tiring rivals
in the middle of the racetrack. DANZA MAGIC failed to menace. SARAH JANE well placed, failed to respond. TALE OF THE LYON away alertly, set a
pressured pace for a little over five sixteenth of a mile then faltered in the stretch.

Footnotes
TRIGZ TOO vied for the lead two wide into the stretch, responded under left handed urging to make the lead near the furlong marker and won going away.
TRAGICALLY QUEWICK away alertly, set a pressured pace until mid stretch along the inside then was no match for the winner. ROCK ON KITTEN offered
a mild bid four wide into the stretch then leveled off. UNIDENTIFIED MAN'S rider lost his right iron at the start, trailed down the backstretch then improved
position outside rivals. SECRET LIFE STYLE was no threat. GEMO RAIN close up for a half, wilted. GOLDENPENCE pressed the early pace three wide
and was through after a half. KLAATU was through early.

TWENTY FOUR KARAT sprinted to a clear lead leaving the clubhouse turn, set the balance of the pace unchallenged and won as much the best while
being kept to task. BONNIE'S BEST unhurried early, had a mild late rally two wide and finished clear for second. ARTIES CRYPTONITE slow early, found
her best stride late in the six path. MY PINK BABY BIRD offered a mild bid three wide into the far turn then came up empty. YOU NAME IT chased the
winner in the four path and gave way in the stretch. HAPPYBDAYMRPREZ improved position outside entering the second turn then faltered. WAR MOON
had brief speed inside. STATE OF GRACE showed little. DANCE DRAMA had speed for a half, stopped on the far turn, pulled up near mid stretch and was
walked off.

and just pasted. TIMESATAPPIN slow early, closed determinedly five wide through deep stretch and just missed getting up in time. MAYITO unhurried
early, loomed boldly two wide in deep stretch and was outfinished. FROG TOWN allowed to settle, offered a strong bid three then two wide on the far turn
and faded late. ORO DE MORO MORO was no factor. PLAIN OR PEANUT chased the winner from the inside into the stretch and weakened late.

Footnotes
DARK BARON vied for the lead two wide while under a strong hold, took charge at the three eighths pole, set the balance of the pace and drew off under
brisk handling through the final furlongs to win going away. QUICK QUICK WHIT stalked the early pace, bid two wide on the far turn and finished clear for
second. SHORTLY never far back, offered a mild bid three wide near the quarter pole then was outfinished. FINISTERE failed to menace. EL BANDIDO
had brief speed. C C'S CLEAR CREEK sprinted to the lead soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for five furlongs then folded.
