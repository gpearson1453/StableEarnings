Footnotes
KATAR broke a bit slow, recovered and was sent up inside rivals to join the pace fray, dueled two wide under rating and to the inside of TACTICAL ATTACK
around the turn, spurted away after being roused in upper stretch, drifted out some leaving the sixteenth marker then held firm while kept alert. BEYOND
AWESOME stalked the contested pace while three to four wide early on, circled five wide into the stretch, moved up leaving the furlong grounds, shifted in a
bit and kept on gamely. TACTICAL ATTACK sped to a slim early lead, vied three then four wide outside the winner, failed to kick on with that one leaving
the three sixteenths and faded. MR LOVE MUFFIN was outrun and raced towards the inside in the drive.

Footnotes
FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY , off the early pace while outside a rival, gathered momentum four wide when put to ride leaving the far turn, engaged DADS DIVA
from her outside nearing the lane, dueled, wrested command near mid stretch, responded to a solid left handed ask soon after and kicked away while kept
to steady pressure. DADS DIVA sped to the front while about three wide, handled some inside pressure into the turn, kicked clear leaving the three eighths,
dug in when confronted by the winner entering the stretch, fought on past the eighth pole then gave way grudgingly. ENGLISH MEADOW prompted the
pace to the inside of DADS DIVA, chased that one past the three eighths, shifted out to be five wide in upper stretch but lacked a finish. UNUSUAL
DANCER was sent up between foes soon after the break, chased two to three wide and faded. BAD BETTY failed to keep pace and raced towards the
inside in the lane.

MONGOLIAN MOON , five then four wide outside of a rival and off of a contested pace, circled into the lane, closed in under left handed asks, drifted out
briefly before being corrected inside the sixteenth pole, sustained under pressure and got up at the wire. COLLECT DIS MONEY moved up to the inside of
KURT'S CHOICE leaving the five eighths and disputed the pace under some rating, was kept in under a firm left handed grip nearing the quarter pole,
responded to solid encouragement leaving the three sixteenths, spurted away inside the furlong grounds, continued gamely while drifting out a bit in deep
stretch but just failed to last. HOWDOYALIKEMENOW saved ground off the pace, made steady progress near mid stretch, threatened inside rivals in deep
stretch but was out finished. HOT MEMORIES , urged along just off the inside and to the inside of a runner, raced between foes in upper stretch, eased out
late and churned on. KURT'S CHOICE sped to the front, was hooked from the inside after about three sixteenths of a mile, sparred around the turn, stayed
on near even terms into the lane, failed to kick on past mid stretch and weakened late. WEGOTBEERONICE was steadied at the break and failed to
menace.

MY INDY , with the pace three wide between rivals and in hand, poked a head in front near the five eighths, dueled under confident handling outside
PARTYOFSIXTEEN leaving the far turn, took over approaching the stretch, responded when given his cue soon after and eagerly pulled away under a solid
hand ride. PERFECT COME BACK settled well off the rail and a contested, raced in hand into the far turn, circled five wide gathering momentum past the
five sixteenths, straightened away and closed willingly to earn the place. BROOKYS TAPIT broke a step slow, recovered and pulled his way forward off the
rail into the backstretch to be in range, took closer order between rivals into the far turn, gave hard chase into the lane and kept on with effort to the inside of
the runner up. SNAKERATTLEANDROLL stalked inside a rival, moved up to take aim into the far turn, was ridden along pursuing past the five sixteenths,
remained towards the inside past mid stretch but lacked the needed finish. PARTYOFSIXTEEN went clear into the first turn then was joined by a pair of foes
to his outside, sparred through the backstretch run and final turn, stayed on with effort after the winner got away in mid stretch then faded very late. BEL
RAGAZZO lagged off the rail, was ridden along four wide and to the inside of a rival past the three eighths, shifted out in the drive and finished with interest.
BRICKHOUSE , with the pace four wide outside rivals, forced the issue to the far turn, failed to go on with the leading pair past the three eighths and gave
way. BACK ALLEY CAT failed to menace.

PEQUENA TORMENTA moved in hand between foes and put a head in front three furlongs out, edge clear under rating past the five sixteenths, kicked
away after being set down in upper stretch, widened while drifting out and was kept to task. SWEET SONNY was jostled and put in tight by LATER DAYS
when that one bore out at the break, recovered and advanced to the inside of rival leaving the three eighths, angled four wide approaching the stretch,
straightened and finished up willingly to gain the place. DANNYBOB sped clear early, was joined into the turn by the winner, prompted that one around the
turn, stayed inside to pursue in upper stretch, kept on with effort to the sixteenth marker then faded. VELLA , soundly bumped and steadied at the break,
raced off the pace and towards the inside, eased out late and offered a mild kick. LOVELY LOLA broke a step slow, raced off the pace and about three wide
into the stretch then offered a belated run without threatening. SOFIA STRONG , four to five wide, pursued to upper stretch and gave way. LATER DAYS
bore out into SWEET SONNY forcing that one into another runner leaving the gate, chased early while three wide, was getting out around the turn and
weakened. An objection by the rider of SWEET SONNY against VELLA for alleged interfence leaving the gate was not allowed.
