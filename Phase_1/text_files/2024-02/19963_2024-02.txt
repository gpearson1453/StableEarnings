Footnotes
GUAPONESS forced the pace outside, took over at the quarter pole then edged away through the stretch. CHASING STARDOM broke alertly and led
inside, vied to the stretch and continued willingly. R ROOSTER broke slowly, advanced wide on the turn then flattened out. CRACK THE CODE saved
ground off the pace and lacked a rally. NICKY DA FOX dropped back early, chased wide and was never a factor. WHOOSH broke slowly and raced far
behind throughout. ROLLIN DEEP flashed speed in the opening quarter then gave way readily.

DEPLANE stalked between rivals, chased inside on the far turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dueled briefly, took over and drew clear under urging.
SAILOR'S RETURN set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way into the far turn, dueled outside of the winner and was no match for that rival.
DAD'S ON A ROLL stalked the pace, chased on the far turn and had no rally. ET'S MAGIC MAN tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and
weakened. TEMPESTUOUS raced off the pace, between rivals on the far turn and failed to threaten. MORE THAN A DANCE stalked three wide, chased
three wide on the far turn and faded. PER RULING EAD 2024-04 FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA RACING COMMISSION, DEPLANE WAS DQ'D DUE TO A

ANGELOFCANTERBURY led under pressure early, shook loose on the turn then edged away while kept to a drive. TAKE IT TO THE MAX trailed early then
split rivals rallying in the stretch too late. TARA'S TALENT well placed behind the dueling leaders, swung wide in the stretch. PEACHY WEACHY rushed up
between rivals opening quarter, moved inside on the turn and finished willingly. COLLIN'S GREY LADY prompted the pace outside, loomed threat in
midstretch then weakened. IFIHADACHANCE prompted the pace three wide for half a mile and faded. SENSE A MILLION dropped far back wide and was
never a factor. BUCKS SOME lacked speed outside and was always outrun. PEACELOVENKARMA dropped far behind and never in contention. TURN ON
THE CHARM forced the pace four wide down the backstretch and stopped.
