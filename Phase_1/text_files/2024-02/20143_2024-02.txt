Footnotes
BRATTON urged up steadily from the two path to go neck and neck with JERSEY JIM down the backstretch and throughout the turn, then dug in to shake
clear in the upper stretch and was ridden out in the final furlong to prove best in the end. HUMOR ME PLEASE saved ground while racing behind the field,
then came came out four wide leaving the turn to close well in late stretch and be up for the place prize. KITTER KAT tracked closely behind the leaders
while two wide, then rallied leaving the turn to close belatedly just missed the place position in the end. JERSEY JIM battled with BRATTON down the
backstretch and into the turn, was in a long drive, then was overpowered by outer rivals before giving way in the final furlong. RATLIFF CITY was brushed
on both sides leaving the gate, then tracked the pace from the inside at a moderate pace, bid mildly on the turn and did not have enough in the end. GHOST
CREEK chased the pace while four wide, then bid on the turn from the two path but came up flat in the lane and needed more. CROW'S NEST chased the
leaders while three wide, then urged steadily throughout the turn but did not spark in the final furlongs.

Footnotes
TEXAS CLUBMAN led the pack into the first turn, then continued down the backstretch under a steady hand ride, cleared the far turn then kept on down the
lane under a strong drive proving better than the rest. SUPERSECRETWEAPON steadied off the heels of rival into the first turn, then settled along the rail,
was well rated throughout the far turn, shifted out four wide then surged down the home stretch and was second best in the end. GHURAIR'S WARRIOR
tracked the pace from the inside at a moderate pace throughout the first three quarters then rallied in the upper stretch and closed well for third position.
SILVER ASSASSIN pressed the pace while two wide leaving the first turn, was in a long drive before rallying in the late stretch and just missed the show
prize in the end. WITT SWEET SIXTEEN was forced outwardly into the first turn, then raced in the two path in the middle of the field, bid leaving the second
turn to rally in the early stretch but it was not enough in the end. DADA BOOM RIDGE was unhurried early, then settled behind the field while two wide, then
rallied too little too late in the home stretch and came up empty. SILVER STEF HIT settled along the inside and was no threat in the end. MORO
TRENDSETTER tracked the pace from the three path in the early furlongs, then lost momentum in the second turn and had no final bid. There was a
STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference in the first turn. After review, no change was made.

Footnotes
EMPERADOR was nicely rated along the inside while racing behind rivals, then steadily advanced on the turn while four to five wide, then dug in grudgingly
in the early stretch to spar with CHIEF BRADY in the final furlong and just had more to be up at the wire. CHIEF BRADY chased the dueling rivals from the
inside, then came out three wide on the turn, surpassed the inner duet then battled gamely with EMPERADOR on the outside and was out finished in the
end. ERNIE BANKER dueled with an inner rival in the early furlongs, gained command briefly entering the turn then gave way in the late stretch. REBEL
EMPIRE dueled from the inside under a hard drive throughout then was used up in the early stretch and weakened in the end. SHADOW MATTER chased
the pace while two wide, then bid from the four path leaving the turn and came up evenly in the stretch. AMERICAN CODE was unhurried early, made a
mild bid in the late stretch and was no threat. CROOKED FELLOW chased the pace while three wide in the early furlongs then faded leaving the turn. IMA
BIG BOPPER settled along the inside and was no menace.

urging steadily on the turn before flattening out in the stretch. BUD GIRL settled while two wide on the backstretch, then from the four path leaving the bend

Footnotes
BLOOD ORANGE was bumped at the start, then saved ground between rivals in the early furlongs, moved up to split rivals while entering the second turn,
had room along the inside to kick clear and hold on well down the lane to succeed in the end. OH DOO DAH DAY chased the pace while two wide under a
steady drive down the backstretch, bid while four wide the second turn, then angled in to the three path to close well in the late stretch and was best for
second place. RUBY THE DESTROYER was bumped leaving the gate, then tracked the pace while two wide throughout the early furlongs, then menaced
in the early stretch to close well in the lane just missing the show prize. GOLD MAKIN GIRL was bumped at the start, then settled at the back in the three
path, then bid on the far turn while coming out five wide, then closed too little too late in the stretch. PINK SOLITAIRE set the pace from inside, was in a long
drive throughout the far turn, then was over taken in the early stretch before giving way in the end. GANGSTER RAP chased the pace from the inside, then
steadied leaving the backstretch, rebid in late stretch and needed more in the end. MISSWISH was bumped on both sides and lacked rally.

Footnotes
MOLA MIA moved from the three path entering the first turn, gained command to lead by many lengths down the backstretch, was challenged by incoming
rivals leaving the far turn but continued to hold on grudgingly down the lane to prove best in the end. SUMMEROSA was forwardly place from the inside into
the first turn, continued to track the pace from the two path down the backstretch, gained second position entering the far turn, rallied in the stretch but did
not have enough to gain the lead and held the place prize in the end. LEPRECHAUN CHARM tracked the pace from the inside in the middle of the field,
then urged steadily throughout the second turn, bid gamely in the final furlongs to close well for the show prize. BACK IN CHARGE was reserved in the
early furlongs, then moved up throughout the second turn, dug in gamely from the four path and was gaining in late stretch. JULIE'S PASSION settled in the
two path down the backstretch, then bid mildly on the far turn, continued to menace in the stretch but it was not enough in the end. MISCHIEF ANGEL
tracked the pace from the three path under a moderate pace throughout the early furlongs, then rallied in the final quarter but came up flat instead. VA
VOOM settled along the inside at the back of the pack, then moved up steadily on the second turn but came up empty in the end. AUNT JANA raced from
the two path towards the back of the field then flattened out after the half and need more in the final furlongs. TWITTER TRAFFIC led the way into the first
turn, then settled back to chase the pace from the inside, then faded after the second turn and had no final bid.

Footnotes
PHILO BEDDOE took command shortly after the start, to set the pace from the inside throughout the turn, was challenged for the lead in the early stretch,
shook clear and held on grudgingly to win in the end. LITTLE AVENGER chased the pace while three wide, then rallied on the turn and into the stretch, was
gaining ground in the end and was best for the place prize. MONET'S DEVIL raced from the three path down the backstretch and into the turn, then was
moving up mildly in the final furlong to be up for third place. CARPE EROS settled along the inside, bid in the upper stretch but came up evenly in the final
yards. BLING BLING BLING chased the pace from the inside at an even pace throughout and needed more in the end. STRAIGHTEN UP led briefly from
the inside, then pressed the pace throughout the turn before giving way in the stretch. LANGUAGE BARRIER raced in the two path then bid leaving the turn
but came up empty in the stretch. FEARLESS PRINCE raced from the inside in the middle of the field then flattened out on the turn and needed rally.
CUSTOM DEELITE was under a steady drive while stalked the pace from the three path.

Footnotes
TEAM LEADER stalked the pace while two wide into the first turn, was well rated down the backstretch, then inched up on the far turn to gain command mid
stretch and held on under a strong drive to prevail in the end. EXCAPING THE BLUES led the way to set the pace in the early furlongs, was in the clear on
the far turn, then veered in in the early stretch before, continued gamely but was out finished in the end. WILTON tracked the pace under a steady drive,
then menaced in the early stretch to close well for the show prize. GOLD PRIZE chased the pace while two wide, rallied from the three path leaving the turn,
shifted inside in the early stretch and continued to rally in the end but it was not enough. TAKE CHARGE GENT chased the pace from the inside, then
rallied leaving the bend, steadied in the early stretch but kept on but came up empty in the end. TAPITS KASH settled along the rail in the early furlongs,
then bid leaving the far turn but it was not enough in the end. CANATLAN settled in the three path, then swung five wide leaving the turn and came up
empty in the end. TIBURON settled in the two path and was no threat. There was a STEWARD'S INQUIRY in regards to interference in the home stretch.
After reviewing the replay, EXCAPING THE BLUES was disqualified from second and place fifth for cutting off rival.
