Footnotes
QUIERO DINERO patiently handled behind the first flight inside, continued to save ground into the turn, knifed out abruptly three wide turning for home
brushing with and carrying SHARP ATTITUDE out entering the stretch, challenged soon after, quickly shook clear and expanded that advantage to win
ridden out. LINE RUNNER void of speed along the inside, continued to be outrun through the turn, rallied up the rail to be clearly second best, no threat to
the winner. CALLIN FOR DOLLARS off a step slow, raced off the pace toward the inside, roused for the drive, staged a mild rally to gain the show.
HOORAY FOR CREDIT broke alertly, contested the issue along the inside for a half, weakened. MAREBELL off the pace, raced two to three path through
the turn, lacked response. SHE'S TABOO vied up front while between horses for a half, weakened when confronted by the winner entering the stretch.
SHARP ATTITUDE with the pace while racing three wide, continued to contest the issue while widest of the first flight through the turn, carried out and was
brushed by the winner entering the stretch, gave way.

Footnotes
HUNTSVILLE stalked the early leader from the outside, raced three wide through the turn, challenged when straightened for home, put a head in front past
the furlong marker, displayed good resolve late to prove best in determined fashion. CLEAR THE AIR broke on top, cleared while racing just off the inside,
continued to hold the advantage turn, responded in upper stretch when confronted by the winner, proved stubborn to the end. G T FIVE HUNDRED chased
the pace from along the inside, proved no match for the top pair in the drive, saved the show. GOLD LUCK settled in the second flight, went one paced in
the two to three path turn, continued evenly through the stretch. A LA CARTE lacked a closing response while racing just off the inside throughout.
CATHEDRAL BEACH in mid pack while out in the strip, three to four wide turn, failed to muster a rally as well. OLLIEMEISTER fell back to trail after the
start, failed to make an impact. KATTATH was also always outrun.

Footnotes
KYKEON bothered and was in tight just just after the start, outrun for a half, angled out sharply to be six wide turning into the stretch, rallied down the middle
of the strip, late bid, drew clear. MASTER OF DISGUISE vied up front after breaking in good order along the inside, held a narrow advantage into and
through the turn, shook off the other speed nearing the furlong marker to be briefly clear, could not contain the winner. TWIRLING TROILLET with the pace
while between horses, continued to vie through the turn and into the stretch, began to gradually weaken nearing the furlong grounds, lasted for the show.
STORM CAT EYES vied up front three wide, first of the lead flight to begin to weaken turning for home. TAP VALLEY narrowly headed up the second flight
while three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. JACKED last away, in some early traffic, raced outside, five wide through much of the turn, lacked a
closing kick. LEAD FOOT back off the pace and the inside early, angled in a bit to be in the two path late turn,improved inside of rivals into the stretch,
flattened out the final furlong. HOLD YOUR APPLAUSE behind the pace while outside, four wide through the turn, retreated down the stretch. MR SEEKER
was finished early, fell further and further back, well beaten.

Footnotes
SISTERSOUTTACHROME off a step slow, raced back and toward the inside, continued in traffic second turn, moved out a bit for the drive, rallied through
traffic to be up in time. SULWE forwardly placed early along the inside, continued well within striking distance while saving ground, took up suddenly in tight
quarters midway on the final turn, moved far outside, bid past the furlong marker, led late, caught. HISSY MISSY pressed the pace while in the three path,
continued to force the issue up the backstretch, challenged the leader from the outside second turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, began to falter
the final furlong, all out to hold the show. MOCHA KISS clear early when setting the pace in the two path, continued to show the way the middle half came in
slightly to appear to tighten up the runner up into the stretch, shook off that foe soon after, could not match the runner up late nor contain the winner. C. C.
HARBOR off a step slow, raced back in trailing toward the inside, steered out three wide into the stretch, staged a mild rally improve position. HOT
SPRINGS BLING lacked early foot in the two path, continued off the rail and one paced through the second bend, finished up evenly. LADY ASTRID in mid
pack off the rail, floated out to the five path exiting the final turn, lacked a closing kick. COURTNEY FAY behind the pace and just off the inside, three wide
out of the final turn, had little left for the stretch run. BLONDES HAVEMO FUN four wide through the first turn when with the main body, continued to race
out in the strip, four wide far turn, outrun. SHE BE SHEEHAN in the second flight three wide, four wide into the stretch, faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH THE SECOND TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

DANCE SOME MO broke alertly, set all the pace inside, shrugged off foe into the stretch, pulled away steadily while kept to task the final sixteenth.
CALRISSIAN within striking distance while racing toward the inside, continued to save some ground into the stretch, could do little with the winner through
the lane, clearly, second best. RABBIT HOUND off a step slow, raced well back and outside, four wide onto the backstretch, remained four wide into the far
turn, rallied widest through the stretch to annex the show. DUAL MONARCHY in the main body while four wide through the first turn, remained outside and
was four wide into the far bend, moved a bit closer and came three wide for the drive, went flat the final furlong. ALL CHOKED UP broke with the winner,
pressed that one from the outside, continued to force the issue up the backstretch and into the far turn, began to weaken entering the stretch and gradually
lost position. PERMAFROST away in good order, within striking distance while three wide and just behind the two leaders, tired while continuing three wide.
AMERICAN ICON went one paced while three wide early, moved in a bit to be in the two path for the drive, came up empty. AIN'T THAT A KICK off a step
slow, raced back, three wide through the final turn, had little for the drive. PANDO was never involved while angled out three wide turning for home. SIR was
finished after a half. PER RULING ECM2024-108 FROM HIWU, CALRISSIAN WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE
TEST.

MASTER OF ARMS broke on top, eventually cleared to the inside the opening quarter, continued to show the way through the turn, stayed clear through the
stretch under steady handling. RITHM NIC pressed the issue early from along the inside, fell back off the winner late backstretch, moved out, chased the
winner in vain, clearly second best. RAM in the second fight while between horses, steered out three wide turning for home, finished up best of the rest.
LEAGUE OF LEGENDS void of speed early, came four to five wide out of the turn, improved position a bit while not a serious threat. FIRE BRYAN within
striking distance while racing three wide, continued to chased the top two past the furlong marker and faltered. SEVEN FLAT off a step slow, failed to
menace. LIL SWEET THANG off the pace and the inside, came four wide out of the turn, no response.

Footnotes
JACKMAN broke on top, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn just off the inside, dueled through the bend, disposed of that rival nearing the
furlong grounds to be clear, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. AIR COMBAT behind the pace along the inside, continued to track the leaders
through the turn in had while saving ground, angled out sharply to be four wide into the lane, brushed past the furlong marker, finished willingly to be slowly
closing the gap on the winner. ULTIMATE devoid of early foot outside, came four to five wide out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to be too
late. THREEFIFTYSEVEN in mid pack along the inside, continued one paced into and through the lane in lacking a finishing kick. UPSTRIKER went one
paced throughout while racing the two path. TEE BURNS pressed outside, dueled in the three path through the turn then weakened through the stretch.
NIKOLAOU last away, was never a threat. TROPIC STORM in mid pack early, was tiring when four wide turning for home, continued to back up through the
lane.

Footnotes
TRACK MATE in the second flight while between horses early, chased the leader through the turn off the inside, took over entering the stretch, clear inside
the furlong marker, drifted out late while maintaining a daylight advantage, held the runner up comfortably safe. MEDIA MOGUL back off the pace and the
inside, dropped inside turn, steered out a bit when advancing past the furlong marker, closest to the drifting winner deep stretch, steadied and altered
course to the inside despite that rival remaining clear, second best. ZAMBEZI lacked early foot outside, four wide into the turn, five wide into the lane, rallied
for the show while closing the gap on the top two. B SUDD back off the pace, came four wide for the drive, finished up evenly in lacking a closing response.
RAGING broke on top, soon got clear, continued to show the way through the turn, faltered when headed upper stretch. DISTORTED PRO within striking
distance for a half, three wide into the stretch, tired in the drive. CODE FIVE finished early, trailed home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF MEDIA MOGUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR
ALLEGED INTERFERENCE, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
RYVIT broke alertly, dueled off the inside up the backstretch and into the turn, disposed of the other speed by late in the turn, moved closer to the inside,
clear into the stretch, not threatened in the run to the wire under steady handlinbg. EXCESS MAGIC forwardly placed off the inside, chased the winner into
the stretch, could do little with that one to the wire, proved game for the place late. CHASING TIME void of early foot after moving inside, continued to save
ground into the turn, in some traffic in lacking clear room late in the bend, got through, rail bid late for the place, missed. SIR WELLINGTON behind the pace
toward the inside, pulled, waited in traffic midway on the turn, three wide for the drive, lacked a late punch. DEVIL'S TOWER back off the pace and the
inside, four wide out of the turn, lacked a closing kick. EMPIRE OF GOLD between horses while behind the two leaders into the turn, three wide exiting the
bend, also lacked a rally,. TAPATIO LEO fractious in the gate prior to the start, was the last to leave, used in moving up to duel inside the winner, stopped
after a half.

Footnotes
CHEZ WHIZ last to leave, advanced five wide through much of the run, remained well out in the strip for the drive, closed with good resolve to be up in time.
AMAZING SUCCESS pushed in break, forward from the start, joined the fray three wide into the turn, shook well clear when straightened for home, could
not contain the winner, remained clear for the place. SPEAKING LOUD lacked speed, mild advance in some traffic late in the, rallied inside horses to be up
for the show. ALL GREEN LIGHTS in the second flight off the inside, four wide into the stretch, closest to the top two a furlong out, lacked a closing punch to
finish up evenly. YEAGERS STRATEGY in mid pack early off the inside, moved closer three wide turning into the stretch, also finished up one paced.
DOUBLECHECK pressed the issue early off the inside, vied between horses and inside the winner through the turn then could not keep up. GENTLE BEN
pushed in start, was never dangerous while racing three wide. GET AWAY WITH IT broke in, raced back and outside, four wide into the turn, faded down
the lane. BERRYVILLE BULLET fell back to trail for a half, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. ENIGMA CODE broke alertly, clear early,
vied through the turn along the inside, backed up through the stretch. IT'S A RAINY DAY raced in mid pack early, finished before a half in giving way four
wide through the turn. WON NINETY in the main body while just off the inside, stopped and finished well back.
