Footnotes
ARGENTINA GIRL dueled three then two wide with STRANGE FRUIT to her inside, took over sole command with seven-sixteenths to go, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and went clear under a drive to prevail. LA GROTTE broke through the gate prior to the
start and was reloaded, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one while running on clear of the rest to be along second best. AFILADA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, continued in the two path into upper stretch, weakened while along clear for the show honors. BRAVO REGINA chased three
to four wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued three to four wide into upper stretch, tired. ALTERINA chased four to five paths off the
inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch
and made no impact. SHASI chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, faltered. STRANGE FRUIT
coaxed from the start, dueled inside of LA GROTTE, yielded the front with seven-sixteenths to go and faded through the turn, continued in the inside route
into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
LOST IN ROME broke very fast, tracked the pace down the backstretch, made a bid outside the runner-up in the three path on the turn, dueled with that foe
in the stretch and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. KUPP went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was
roused into upper stretch, lost the advantage at the three-sixteenths, fought on gamely with the winner, dueled with that foe to the finish and missed while
able to get the place. LIFE CHANGER was guided out early then settled off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, was asked outside the
five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch, pursued the top two while outside in the drive and finished willingly for the show. TETSU settled off the
pace, angled in approaching the five-eighths pole, went three wide early on the turn, angled five wide near the five-sixteenths pole and lacked the needed
response. JAKE ROCKS chased the pace on the outside then in the four path on the turn, dropped to the three path near the quarter-pole then the two path
into upper stretch and tired. BEACHWALKER was fractious in the gate then broke a bit slow, angled in while urged along at the rear, went around the turn in
the two path, came out into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
LIBERTY FLAME broke out a step at the start bumping TOWERING GAZE in tandem with MARIAH'S FORTUNE, raced three wide in closest aim of the
leader before taking over the front three furlongs from home, shook away in hand and continued three wide into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to
prevail. JUST A NYQUIST coaxed from the gate, chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while offering up a mild kick to secure the place
honors. CAPTIVATING CARA coaxed from the start, chased along the inside coming under coaxing half a mile from home, swung three wide into upper
stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. HONORABLE LILLY broke open the stall door prior to the start, broke on top at the break and showed the way in
hand just off the inside, yielded the front three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MARIAH'S FORTUNE broke in a step
at the start bumping TOWERING GAZE in concert with LIBERTY FLAME, then came in to bump that rival once more after the start forcing that foe to
steady, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went five to six wide for home and tired. MORE
MANGO coaxed from the gate, chased five to six wide down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing midway, swung
three to four wide into upper stretch and made no impact. TOWERING GAZE got bumped between foes at the start who each broke her way, then got
bumped by MARIAH'S FORTUNE after the start and was forced to steady off the heels of LIBERTY FLAME, chased four then three wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and was unable to make an impact.

Footnotes
AUGUSTINE RED broke out at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch under a
left-handed crop, rallied outside while lugging in badly, was corrected repeatedly by the rider with a strong right-handed rein and a left-handed crop made a
bid outside the leaders inside the furlong marker, came in while taking over late and prevailed. BADLANDS RULER was hustled from the gate then coaxed
along on the outside, ranged up in the four path on the turn, was given his cue late on that bend, gained to make an outside bid in upper stretch then took
the lead, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was caught while able to hold the place. BLACK ALMIGHTY chased the pace on the outside then in
the three path on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths pole, battled with two foes under a drive into the final furlong, fought on into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while able to get the show. MAD BANKER was well placed just off the pace, drafted in the two path early on the turn, was
asked near the five-sixteenths, chased the vanguard in the stretch and lacked the needed kick. I GOT BUSTED leaned in some at the start, sped to the front
then showed the way, dropped from the two path to the inside early on the turn, was urged along under threat passing the five-sixteenths, lost the
advantage in upper stretch, battled inside of two opponents under a drive into the final furlong, dropped back into the final sixteenth and tired. SOLO IN
PARIS broke in at the start, dropped back while ridden along, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. GAME MISCONDUCT was ridden
along at the rear on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CHATEAU broke alertly then was hustled, showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action in the two path on the far turn, responded well when
put to a drive in upper stretch, came under the crop outside the furlong marker and drew off under steady urging. COMMERCE COMET chased the pace
from third position, saved ground on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. BOURBON'S HOPE was coaxed along
off the pace, moved in near the half-mile pole, came under stronger encouragement in the two path on the turn, turned into the stretch under the crop and
lacked the needed response while able to get the show. CLEM LABINE bumped with a rival while off a bit slow then was taken up while pinched back,
spotted the front several lengths, went around the turn in the three path, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. CAJUN CASANOVA bumped
with a rival at the start, was urged along towards the rear, moved in outside the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SUNRISE
JOURNEY tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty.
NOBODYRIDESFORFREE broke a half-step slow, was urged along on the outside, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, went four then five wide on the turn
and never reached contention. BREAKING STONES was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and capitulated. MR PHIL was urged along
on the outside, went five wide on the turn and had nothing left. ONE MORE BREW was urged along off the pace, dropped back three to four wide on the
turn, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
ROYAL POPPY dueled from the four path with STONEWALL STAR to her inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for home, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and held well to prevail.
TOUGH STREET chased three then two wide before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, closed in through the final furlong but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. BUSTIN BAY chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, had the rider lost the handle on the crop at the eighth pole and offered up a mild kick.
TAMING THE TIGRESS got bumped at the start by GIVE ME KISSES, chased four to five wide until tucked to the two path into the turn, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home and kept on one paced to the finish. GIVE ME KISSES broke in at the start bumping TAMING THE
TIGRESS, chased five then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, made mild headway while unable to
make an impact. STONEWALL STAR dueled inside of ROYAL POPPY three wide down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DESERT DALLIANCE chased six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired.
TOWHEAD rushed the stall door as the latch was sprung rearing up forcing the assistant starter to keep a hold to protect both horse and rider, conceded
eight to nine lengths to the front at minimum before settling into stride, chased along the inside at the tail of the field, came under coaxing midway on the
turn, went two to three wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout. There was a Stewards' Inquiry into the start focusing on TOWHEAD. After review it
was deemed that TOWHEAD was in the hands of the starter and impeded at the break from having a fair start and therefore TOWHEAD was declared a
non-starter prior to the race being declared official.

Footnotes
SNARKY was hustled to the front, angled in while quickly opening up on the field, raced inside on the turn, responded well when put to the crop in upper
stretch and held under strong urging. ZHEN LOU bobbled inward at the start then bumped with a foe, moved in under urging near the five-eighths pole,
dropped back leaving the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, came out into upper stretch, rallied outside in the final furlong and finished
fast to get the place. NECESSARYANDPROPER broke in at the start, moved out while urged along early, chased inside on the turn, cut the corner under a
drive into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth and willingly earned the show. MANGIA bumped with a foe at the start, was urged along
towards the front on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth and tired. MISS BOURBON was hustled
from the gate then urged along towards the front, chased in the two path on the turn, pursued the winner into the final furlong, dropped back into the final
sixteenth and weakened. DELL ARTE was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and lacked the needed response.
EAST HARBOR broke in then bobbled and was off a step slow, raced well off the pace under urging, went around the turn in the two path and failed to rally.
FRANKIE'S ROSE bumped with a rival at the start, was hard ridden towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and never reached contention. MOTHER
MARY was urged along at the rear, went three then four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MAJESTIC LAURA ANN bumped with a rival at the start
while off a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and was no factor. BROOKLYN ROSIE was ridden along on the
outside, went four then three wide on the turn and failed to respond.
