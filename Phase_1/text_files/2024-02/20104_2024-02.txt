Footnotes
POSEIDON'S SON chased the pace into the stretch, surged in the six path outside the leader under left handed urging through deep stretch and was along
in time. LIMIT UP sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, set the pace well off the rail until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. MAKING ME
CRAZY well placed near the inside, was the best of the rest. ONE MORE RING allowed to settle, moved up three wide on the turn then came up empty.
KERANOS was no factor. PERFECT SPEIGHTY had brief speed outside the leader in the six path.

Footnotes
EL DE CHIMI pressed the pace along the inside for a half, shifted two wide nearing the far turn, split horses to draw on even terms for the lead midway on
the far bend, battled the balance of the trip inside the runner and proved best in a game effort under left handed urging. HOUSED stalked the early pace,
surged three wide midway on the far turn to draw on even terms for the lead, matched strides with the winner two wide the length of the stretch and just
missed. CAMBIASO trailed for nearly a half, offered a mild bid four wide nearing the top of the stretch then was outfinished. KHOPILOT failed to menace.
RESVALON set a pressured pace two wide then along the inside for nearly six furlongs, kept on into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. HAD
RIGHT stalked the pace four then three wide into the far turn and weakened in the stretch.

ICE BLAST checked between horses on the clubhouse turn, was allowed to settle, closed willingly five wide under right handed urging through the far turn
and into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker, was put to left handed urging and finished full of run to win going away. SUPPLY CHAIN well
placed, split horses four wide entering the far turn, gained a narrow lead, battled until deep stretch then was no match for the winner. CANDY CRUSHEM
stalked the early pace three wide, drew on even terms for the lead near the three furlong marker, battled into the stretch and was outfinished in the late
stages. SUDDEN SHIFT pressed the early pace two wide and lacked the needed response. BOSS BEAR failed to menace. SIR SAHIB was no threat.
BLAME IT ON EDDIE offered a mild bid two wide into the far turn then came up empty. MY TWO AUNT JOANS away alertly, set the pace along the inside
for five furlongs then was used up.

Footnotes
ZASHIXIARAYAN unhurried early, responded with a rapid moved three wide through the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole and drew clear under left
handed urging. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA slow early, closed fast two wide, split horses at the top of the stretch and was steadily cutting into the winners
advantage late. HOT PRINCESS never far back, passed tiring rivals three wide. LOTS OF SASS sped to the lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace
for nearly a half, kept on into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BOLD NICKY had speed two wide into the turn then weakened. MI CANCION
pressed the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. LIGHTENING LOTTIE had good early speed along the inside and was through after a half.
