Footnotes
WOOD BE WILD advanced four wide on the turn, led into the stretch and held on gamely in a tight finish. LIAM'S BLUE MOON earned a narrow advantage
inside, vied throughout and continued willingly. MODERN MIDAS chased off the pace wide early then closed well through the final furlong. MIZZEN MAN
broke alertly and settled wide, bid into the far turn and closed well. CADDY MAN lacked speed inside, angled out in the stretch with late energy.
PORSUPUESTO trailed to the stretch, moved wide and finished well too late. BIG WARDEN underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, dueled between rivals
and tired. REFUND RIGLER forced the pace in the two path and began fading on the turn.

JAMAICAN MI HAZEL was off a bit slow, raced off the pace, inside on the turn and failed to threaten. HER TICKET TO RIDE stalked outside, chased on the

Footnotes
JUST STEP ON IT pressed the pace raing close up outside, bid two wide on the far turn, dueled with LE VIN, battled it out with that rival in a long stretch
duel and prevailed determinedly. LE VIN set the pace on the inside, dueled with JUST STEP ON IT on the far turn, battled heads apart with that rival
through a long stretch drive and continued gamely inside to the finish. LONESOME BOY tracked close up on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and
raced evenly in the final furlong. TWILIGHT DANCER stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and tired. TREVESSO raced off the pace inside and failed
to respond. CLANCY O'TOOLE raced off the pace and did not factor. SHARP TONES raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, went three wide
on the far turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
HOLLYWOOD JET sprinted clear early, vied inside after quarter mile to the finish, alternated for the lead and fought back to gain the advantage in the final
furlong. BOURBON MUSIC engaged the winner on the turn, led narrowly in the stretch but was outdueled in a game try. VEESON lacked speed inside,
swung wide in the stretch and closed well. UNCLE ERNIE settled just off leader inside then flattened out in the stretch. ONE MORE SCOOP raced just off
the pace, was blocked in traffic near the top of the stretch and failed to threaten. COWAN very unruly in the post parade, raced inside and lacked a rally.
NICO lagged far behind then caught a fading rival. OURNATIONONPARADE dropped back wide down the backstretch, moved briefly closer on the turn
then faded.

Footnotes
AVA K'S BOY vied inside in a contested early pace, dueled inside on the turn, held a short lead entering the stretch, then had the rider hit HE'S
INCREDIBLE with the crop at the top of the lane, dueled with that rival through the final furlong and dug in gamely inside to prevail. HE'S INCREDIBLE vied
three wide between rivals for the early lead, dueled two wide on the turn, was hit with the crop from the rider of AVA K'S BOY, dug in gamely outside of that
foe and continued willingly to the finish. JEBOLOGIST steadied soon after the start, raced off the pace, came four wide into the lane, rallied mildly and
earned the show spot. ZIP IT SCOTTY vied between rivals for the early lead, then chased on the turn, closed mildly on the rail and missed for third. BOX OF
CHOCOLATES raced off the pace, came wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BIG BROWN SHOES vied four wide for the early lead, chased four
wide on the turn and tired. BIG CITY BOB vied five wide for the early lead, then chased five wide, came three wide into the lane and tired. PRESS MY BETS
was off slowly, pulled up on the backside and vanned off. After the race, there was a Stewards' Inquiry, along with Jockey Objections by the rider of HE'S
INCREDIBLE against the winner and JEBOLOGIST against HE'S INCREDIBLE. Following video review, AVA K'S BOY was disqualified and placed second
for the incident at the top of the stretch.
