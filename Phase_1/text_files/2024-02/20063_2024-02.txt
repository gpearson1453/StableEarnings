Footnotes
NAUGHTY STREAK took over and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the half mile pole, contested the advantage nearest
the rail on the far turn and held well under steady handling through the lane. MACHISTO stalked from the three path, challenged leaving the second turn,
contested at a close disadvantage off the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. DOWSING ROD settled in the four path, picked up the chase leaving
the half mile pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and finished evenly. BIG SMILE became a bit fractious in the gate then stalked off the rail, gave
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn, left the turn outside and showed little further. THEIRREGISTRDIMNOT
saved ground off the early pace and showed little response through the backstretch. BULLETONTHECHARTS settled off the pace about the three path,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. WILLIAM'S CAUSE rated close to the early
pace inside then faded into the second turn.

Footnotes
BONNIE BLUETOOTH settled close off the rail the first turn, gave chase into the backstretch and rounded the far turn about the three path, took the lead
entering the lane, ran clear mid-stretch and drew off with steady handling. REVEIRS MINUTE stalked off the rail, picked up the chase leaving the three
eighths pole and took the nod two deep at the quarter, was met entering the stretch, raced close to mid-stretch but ultimately had to settle for second best.
MISS WILD saved early ground, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and came along for third mid-stretch.
CHURCH KEY took over and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure approaching the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail at the
quarter pole and weakened nearing the head of the lane. CLEARLY VISIBLE settled just off the early pace inside, picked up the chase approaching the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little more. SO RED THE ROSE saved ground. PANGEA raced in the three path the opening
turn, left the turn outside and showed little response. SALTY SAUL settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

Footnotes
BON BUENO entered the opening turn about the five path but was carried to the outside leaving the turn, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole,
steadily improved in the three path on the far turn, dueled for the lead toward mid-stretch, raced clear passing the sixteenth pole and held on well. MON
GATEAU became a bit edgy in the gate then took over while angling to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole,
raced at the rail on the far turn, was met nearing mid-stretch and relented later yards. NET WORTH became edgy in the gate and raced in the four path the
first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and came along to take third later yards. A THOUSAND IDOLS
settled inside on the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and showed little more. PRINCE FRED
veered out leaving the gate and settled just off the pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. BET ON BITZ
was not a factor. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME was pinched back early and mostly saved ground. ROLL ME OVER became edgy in the gate, bore out on the
opening turn and the second turn and was eased.

sixteenths and ran clear from the three eighths, widened her lead at the rail on the far turn and was kept sharp in the lane. QUINN ELIA was bumped
outward and into Thelastsay leaving the gate then settled close about the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the
rail and settled for second best. SYMPTOMATIC was forced out and into Candy Tricks leaving the gate, raced in the three path the first turn and gave chase
toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. SHOTGUN MARGARET came away awkwardly then saved
ground, bid mildly leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the four path on the far turn. CANDY TRICKS was bumped outward and into Quinn Elia
leaving the gate then saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. DREAM STREET

LEGENDAIRE rated close in the four path the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, took the lead in the three path midway on the far turn
and was kept alert in the stretch. LAWYER UP RILEY rated off the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the half mile pole and steadily improved, rounded
the far turn about the three path and dug in to clear second later yards. SHARP STYLE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the
five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and came along for third later yards. PROSPECTIVE LOVE stalked two deep on the first turn
and raced at even terms at the half mile pole, took the nod nearing the seven sixteenths pole, was met off the rail midway on the far turn and weakened in
the stretch. PILOTE COMETE saved ground on the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch. REBEL WARRIOR angled to the
inside and set the early pace, was met passing the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back approaching the quarter and weakened
at the rail on the far turn. ARROW OF TIME settled in the three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch.

KENNY HAD A NOTION stalked off the rail, took the lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and kept the edge over ZEN MASTER from that point, cleared
that one at the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail, widened under steady handling but was taken in hand late yards. The latter rated the
pace inside, was met nearing the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from there, but dropped back at the five sixteenths, raced off the rail on the far turn
and settled for second best. SHACKLED LOVE settled off the rail the opening turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole and raced at the rail
on the far turn, but showed little further. HOME SCHOOL was pinched back at the start then saved ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and passed some rivals. COMMAND THE CAT veered outward and made contact with Home School leaving the gate then
saved ground, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little further. TATE saved ground off
the pace, gave chase from the three eighths pole but flattened stride at the rail on the far turn. SUE LOVES BARBADOS raced in the three path the first
turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. LIKE SEGAL rounded the first turn about the five path, entered
the backstretch outside and showed little response. CATFISH raced in the three path the opening turn and showed little response through the backstretch.
JAMMIN STILL was bumped at the break, raced in the three path the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch and showed little response.

Footnotes
RUFFNER took over while tapering to the inside and rated the pace, cleared Mo Eh Hennessy at the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the turn and was
steadily handled in the lane. DOCTOR JERRY gave chase, raced near the rail on the turn and dueled through the stretch for second. GOLDEN ADAGE
angled to the outside and gave chase, rounded the turn about the five path, dug in to take third later yards and was gaining on the runner-up. PERSONAL
FINANCE was reluctant to load then gave chase, raced in the four path on the turn and flattened stride mid-stretch. AIR KENNEY chased through the
backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. WATCH THE TRAMCAR gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn, was eased
out leaving the turn but showed little more. MO EH HENNESSY engaged in close chase through the backstretch but dropped back at the quarter pole, raced
near the rail on the turn and weakened.
