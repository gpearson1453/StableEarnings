outer pacesetter in the final strides. DEVILS ONLY FRIEND set the pace in the three path, was cued in the two path midway around the turn, dug in while
facing challenges on both sides turning into the stretch, held on to the lead going into the final furlong, but was outlasted by an inner foe late to finish with
place. HEALS THE SOUL tracked in the three path, but got stymied between foes in the two path around the turn, was roused while swinging out to the six
path at the top of the lane, and kept on between foes for show. TAKECAREOFBUSINESS chased in the five path, fanned out to the seven path under a ride
turning into the stretch, and stayed on, but lost the photo for show. ROYAL QUALITY rated in the four path early, ranged up four wide to bid passing the
quarter, but flattened in the final furlong. ROLLING ON was sent out of the gate to press the pace in the four path, but gaveway between foes turning into

Footnotes
SWAGGISH set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive in the lane. MUFRIH was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, went three
wide between foes around the far turn, shifted further out in upper stretch, continued on the left lead and was just up for the place in the final strides. ARAK
tracked the pace four and five wide, moved into a clear second in upper stretch and just missed the place. DON'T LET ME DOWN threw his head at the
start, broke in the air and was thus away several lengths behind the field, raced well back inside, angled five wide in upper stretch, rallied belatedly between
foes and just missed second and third. MANNIX (IRE) stalked the pace two and three wide and faded in the drive. MISTER MOORE was bumped at the
start, raced two wide in midpack and lacked a rally. EUPHORIA STAR raced off the pace two wide, swung eight wide in upper stretch and passed tiring
rivals. SWATH pressed the winner three wide and tired in the stretch. HOLLYWOODHELLRAISR was bumped at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. GLORIOUS TRIBUTE failed to menace while racing four wide. EYES OF CHAMPION was outrun inside. IMPRESSIVE SPEED was bumped at
the start, chased the pace three and four wide and had no response.

Footnotes
AMAZIN QUEEN laid off the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was roused to range up four wide approaching the quarter, swept to the lead
turning into the stretch, and drew clear. BRAMBLE BAY stalked in the two path, waited along the inside rounding the far turn, and ran on while on her left
lead from the rail through the stretch for place. ROSEBUD'S HOPE got fractious in the gate, rated along the inside, was coaxed in the three path turning into
the lane, and kept on for show. MISS M M set the pace inside, was roused from the rail early into the far turn, but lost the lead while floating out to the six
path entering the stretch, and faded. KISS ME HARDY had an awkward start and trailed in the three path, fanned out to the seven path under a drive turning
into the lane, but made no impact. LATIN NIKKITA tracked in the three path but weakened from the six path in the stretch. LOVE HER LOTS sat up close
while four wide around the first turn to prompt the pace in the three path down the backside, but gaveway entering the stretch.
