Footnotes
JOLLY BY GOLLY stalked the pace under confident handling, circled the turn three wide, secured command in upper stretch, drew away and was under
urging in mid stretch. CAPTAIN QUINT , bumped by BARON'S LEGACY at the start, stalked the duel near the inner rail, waited for room leaving the turn,
altered course to the four path in upper stretch and rallied. MARYLAND MOON , along the inner rail mid way on the turn, angled out for the drive, was
fanned five wide in upper stretch and passed tired rivals. MILANO , caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, was not a factor and swung to the five
path near the eighth pole. EDGE OF GLORY disputed the pace outside BARON'S LEGACY and faltered in upper stretch. COLLECTION DAY , fractious in
the starting gate, stumbled at the break and was outrun. BARON'S LEGACY bumped CAPTIAN QUINT when coming out at the break, hugged the inner rail
disputing the pace and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SPOILS OF WAR prompted the pace to the inside of FREE ADMISSION early on, was nicely rated back near the half, remained inside under a hold and
tracked around the turn, eased out when given her cue and split rivals into lane, seized command with three sixteenths remaining, opened up under a left
handed drive then was taken in hand through the final seventy yards. JOB'S NOT FINISHED , off the pace and in the clear while saving ground, eased out
in upper stretch, worked between runners leaving mid stretch and kept on willingly to gain the place. RAZORETTE stumbled at the break, recovered to stalk
three deep heading to the half, chased outside a pair of foes while wandering four wide into the lane, corrected and continued with effort.
PEACHESSWEETNOTION broke outward and bumped a rival, straightened and was sent up between foes to stalk the pace, raced three wide between
runners with pursuit into the lane, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and faded. KANEM , urged while off the pace and towards the inside, angled out for
the drive but lacked a solid run. COAL'S MAGNOLIA , away slowly when bumped and forced out, lagged back off the pace, raced four wide in upper stretch
and failed to muster up a serious kick. FREE ADMISSION , a bit rank leaving the gate, hustled up to take command after a sixteenth of a mile, secured the
rail after the winner took back near the half, remained clear to the quarter pole, gave little resistance when threatened entering the lane and weakened in
mid stretch.

under a drive until late. TINA TINA TINA chased the winner to the stretch, gave way and held the place. FLOGE lacked speed, raced in the two path around

path and gave way. SUPER FABULOUS hugged the inner rail throughout and gave way. SUN STREAMING , outrun, swung to the five path entering the
stretch. BOOTSY'S MERLOT , moved to the four path leaving the turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
REE NEE'S SIX , away in good order, tracked three wide in hand heading to the half, bid between foes to poke a head in front leaving the far turn, was
headed from her outside by HOT DANCE mid turn, dug in while closer to the rail, regained a slim advantage nearing mid stretch, shook clear on her way to
the sixteenth pole and held firm under a drive. HOT DANCE , five wide outside rivals while in range to the half, quickly bid four deep then put a head in front
while dueling outside the winner mid turn, continued the battle while on her left lead, could not match strides inside the furlong grounds, kept on willingly and
switched to her correct lead late. K KAKE POP hopped at the break and was off a bit slow, was taken to rate off the pace, saved ground leaving the three
eighths, checked behind a tiring rival nearing the quarter pole, shifted out and churned on. GHOSTLY ANNA , four wide in close attendance nearing the
turn, gave hard chase three deep mid turn, shifted in nearing the lane and faded. FLAG SONG FLYIN , sluggish from the gate, lagged under a ride while
saving some ground, angled four wide and had a slight kick. TROUBLED DREAMS dueled two wide outside a rival early on, chased between foes leaving
the far turn and tired. CASSOULET vied inside, ceded to foes leaving the far turn, faltered mid turn and was eased late.

Footnotes
VIRGINIA FULLA lacked speed, circled horses the far turn, swung to the five path at the head of the stretch, closed outside horses, led near the sixteenth
pole then drove clear. STEELE MONEY stalked the pace down the backstretch, moved up four deep on the far turn, angled out when ASSEMBLY POINT
rushed up inside him in upper stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and held the place. DREAM OF BLESSINGS , far back after stumbling badly at the
break, worked between horses in the stretch and rallied late. WORKIN ON A DREAM hugged the inner rail throughout, gained the lead approaching the
eighth pole then gave way in the drive. ASSEMBLY POINT (BRZ) advanced in the two path between horses leaving the far turn, angled out in upper stretch
and weakened in the drive. TRANSFER THE FUNDS was no factor. BERMONDSEY sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, drifted to the
two path turning for home and gave way. KRUG , three wide both turns, chased the pace and gave way.

Footnotes
KAPADOKYA quickly took command, set a rated pace towards the rail, turned away a challenge nearing the quarter pole, responded when set down soon
after, opened up under a drive in mid stretch then held sway while kept to task. CHAVETA rated off the pace, edged up while saving ground leaving the five
sixteenths, continued inside progress past mid stretch and finished well. BREAKING RULES broke inward and soundly bumped with a rival, corrected and
edged up three wide between runners, threatened outside the winner leaving the five sixteenths, drifted a bit into the lane, straightened to pursue past mid
stretch then came up empty late. MADDIE TEN broke a beat slow, worked inward and edged up under rating, steadied along into the turn, stalked inside
rivals mid turn, eased out soon into the lane, chased to mid stretch then faded. PAGAN MYSTIQUE flashed speed along the rail then was shuffled back
after about a furlong, trailed leaving the three eighths, cut the corner under while under a ride into the lane, slipped through inside runners leaving mid
stretch and closed willingly. G'S FIREBALL away last when roughed up from both sides at the break, regrouped and found herself well back into the turn,
came three wide for the drive, angled out some and finished with effort. VALLEY STAR , three then two wide with pursuit, raced between rivals mid turn,
failed to kick on nearing mid stretch and weakened. GRACE IN EXCESS came in at the break making sound contact with G'S FIREBALL, corrected and lost
ground five wide, advanced outside runners mid turn, chased to the head of the lane then gave way. MY CATHOLIC GIRL bore out at the break, was
righted and moved up four wide into the turn, chased three wide and between runners past the five sixteenths and weakened. PER RULING FROM
MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, KAPADOKYA WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

DERBYNESS bobbled at the break, regrouped and rated outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep to take command mid way on the turn,
steadily drew away through the stretch and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. DASHING D'ARTAGNAN , a forward factor along the inner rail down the
backstretch, moved to the two path on the far turn and gained the place late. EL DE LARRY , a forward factor along the inner rail for six furlongs, dropped
back a bit leaving the far turn, swung outside in mid stretch and finished willingly. OMAR COMIN stumbled leaving the starting gate, advanced four deep the
first turn, set the pace outside EL DE LARRY, lost the lead on the far turn and weakened through the lane. THENAME OF THEGAME , three wide the first
turn, chased the pace outside horses down the backstretch and weakened on the far turn. SURFBOARD was outrun.

Footnotes
SOCIETY BALL was nudged up soon after the start and stalked a hotly contested pace while about three wide, took closer order while coaxed along mid
turn, surged four wide and past the embattled leaders to take command into the lane, opened up under right handed asks and was kept alert to the finish.
PROFITUNITY , away to the early lead, was joined then headed from her inside after a furlong, battled outside GRAMMY GIRL into and around the turn,
fought on three wide and between foes into the stretch, proved no match for the winner but stayed on with good effort to earn the place. GRAMMY GIRL
broke slowly, recovered and rushed up to the inside of rivals to take a short lead, dueled to the inside of PROFITUNITY into and around the turn, came out a
bit entering the lane, clung to second leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final seventy yards. AUDIBLY , bumped and carried out multiple
paths leaving the gate, regrouped and raced far back into the turn, remained well back past the five sixteenths, saved ground with some momentum into the
stretch, eased out a bit and finished up well. VINO FROM ERNIES veered out at the break bothering AUDIBLY, corrected and settled well back, saved
ground mid turn, angled out for the drive and churned on. VINO DOLCE , sluggish from the gate, edged up to the inside of runners leaving the five eighths
and stalked, shifted out four wide with pursuit into the lane, failed to kick on nearing the eighth pole and faded. LACEY GRACIE gave early chase between
runners, dropped back around the turn then shifted wide.

Footnotes
MOSLER TIME bobbled at the break, recovered and edged up to prompt the pace three wide, dropped in a bit and was put to pressure chasing past the
three eighths, went on the attack soon after, took over from SECOND WAVE near the three sixteenths, kicked clear under solid handling, edged away a bit
with a sixteenth to go and held firm while kept alert. PAVED IN GOLD , brushed leaving the gate, showed speed between runners, shifted in towards the rail
leaving the five eighths then steadied when in tight near the half, regrouped to chase along the rail and under a ride mid turn, came out near the three
sixteenths and finished gamely to be well clear of the rest. SECOND WAVE , three deep on a short lead in the opening furlong, drafted in towards the rail
and went clear nearing the turn, was taken on by the winner leaving the five sixteenths, battled into the lane, stayed willingly to about the sixteenth marker
then faded. INFINITE SERIES had speed inside a pair of rivals then steadied back off foes leaving the five eighths, eased back off heels into the turn then
angled out, made a mild three wide run in upper stretch then flattened out. THE LAST JUMPSTART drifted in and brushed with PAVED IN GOLD leaving
the gate, settled well off the early pace, came three wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. ARMY CADET broke slowly, was urged along off the pace,
came four wide into the lane but failed to generate the needed run. BOX OF ROCKETS angled out from behind rivals entering the turn, circled four wide into
the lane, drifted in near mid stretch and gave way.
