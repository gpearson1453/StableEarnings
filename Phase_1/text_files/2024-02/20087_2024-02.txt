passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to get up for the win. ASTRONAUT OSCAR stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter,
swung out to the four path coming around the bend and dueled to the wire to just miss. SIX WHIPS led the way on the inside early, navigated the turn from
the two path and gave way in the final furlong. AWESOMEBROTHERBILL raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the three path and finished evenly. SAHM TEQUILA chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the two path
and weakened in the lane. BEAST OR FAMINE tracked the leader on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and faded in
the lane. FUEL THE BERN raced off the pace up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path and made no bid. AZTEC LEGEND pressed the
