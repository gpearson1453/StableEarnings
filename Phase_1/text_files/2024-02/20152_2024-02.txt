ASTERN BANKER shuffled back at the start, raced two to three wide down the backstretch, moved up four wide near the three sixteenths pole and got up
under strong handling. EXOTIC'S BEAR quick to begin, bore out around the first turn, bothered foes, a stewards inquiry was filed by Suburban Prince and
stewards disqualified and placed fifth. IN THE MIDST was bumped, in tight in the early stages, forced wide around the first turn, drifted near the three
sixteenths pole and kept on gamely to the wire. JAMES'S MOONSHINE forced six wide around the first turn, angled in through the far turn, raced along the
inside into the upper stretch and flattened out in the drive. SUBURBAN PRINCE was carried out around the first turn, had a wide run and never had a rally.
LEVEL stalked the pace along the inside, angled six wide into the upper stretch and faded. WOODS OF CONGAREE raced in tight quarters at the
beginning, was up close early and gave way.

ITSNOTMYJOB sprinted clear early on, held well and proved best under strong handling. D'WILD MUFFIN chased the early leader two deep but was no
match for the winner in the drive. TIZ HOPPIN chased the pace from the inside and kept on to the wire. SUNSHINE EMILY hustled along to race mid pack,
raced three to four wide around the far turn and needed more. FASHION FACT raced from the inside early, angled five wide and never threatened. READY
TO GET LOUD raced two to three wide and had no response. KISS UPON A STAR was off a step slow and trailed.

LODE OF BLARNEY dropped back off the pace setters, moved up from the inside through the far turn, eased out into the upper stretch and edged away
under steady pressure. HUEY DUEY was off slowly, rushed up from the rail to vie, clear near the three sixteenths pole but couldn't hold off the winner late in
a game effort. ELIOT NESS was hustled along from the outside, raced five to six wide around the far turn and finished willingly while continuing a outside
run. BANJO BEAR vied for the early lead between rivals, drifted out near the three eighths pole and weakened a bit through the drive. FORCED RANKING
void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened. JONO chased four deep between rivals and weakened. JUSTIN SPEIGHT chased the pace from
the far outside of foes and faded.

the far turn and lacked a bid. DAAHERS BULLY hard chase from the outside, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. TIM'S

the wire. SHIPS LOG broke awkwardly, shifted five deep and made a good late gain. PHLASH DRIVE was off slowly, moved up four to five wide in the drive
and closed in too late. JUDGE'S BRIBE hustled three deep and weakened through the strech run. JOEY'S VALENTINE raced mid pack early, saved ground
through the far turn and had no response. FOR REEL dropped back early, raced three to four wide and lacked a bid. YAYASGOTMOREGAME failed to
respond. LITTLE BITOTHUNDER raced six deep into the upper lane and never threatened.
