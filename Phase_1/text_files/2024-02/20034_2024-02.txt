Footnotes
LOVE MY JIMMY led the way up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and drew off in the lane. RUN SNAPPY bumped with horse to his
inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the stretch. GIANT'S BRITE
EYE bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around the bend in the two path and improved
position in the lane. RECKONING DAY bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the backstretch, continued
around the turn in the four path and never threatened. HIJO GALANTE bumped with horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, swung out
to the four path coming around the bend and made no bid. CHAOKOON trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
BAILS HIM OUT chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, dueled in the stretch and kicked clear. FULL
BORE led the way on the inside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the two path, dueled in the lane and was caught late. PHILBIN
ROAD tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and kept on to the wire. EMPEROROFTHENORTH raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and finished evenly. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT raced in the middle
of the pack on the outside through the early going, continued around the turn in the four path and made no bid. HARBOR THUNDER raced in the middle of
the pack between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and showed no kick. PIRATE MISCHIEF raced off the pace
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. PAINTED SMOKE trailed well behind the field racing up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and was never a factor.
