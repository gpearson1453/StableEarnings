Footnotes
QUEEN JELLY BEAN took a quick lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure past the seven sixteenths pole, cleared Avalanche
Is Comin past the five sixteenths, widened at the rail on the far turn and was kept sharp in the lane. JAYLA stalked the early pace inside, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and came along for second mid-stretch. AVALANCHE IS COMIN veered out at
the break then raced in the four path the first turn, briefly drew to even terms approaching the seven sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point, faded
off the rail on the far turn then relented second mid-stretch. MALTESE ROSE raced in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and showed little more. PURPLE CALLA raced in the four path the first turn and never factored. TIZZ
THE G dropped well back shortly after the start.

AUBURN MILL took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, drew clear of Change Your Luck approaching the three eighths pole and was pressured
into the far turn, was met toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady encouragement and held on well. WINDSOR'S TRACKER settled off the rail
on the opening turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dueled through the final sixteenth to take second late yards.
THEWITCHISGONE rounded the first turn about the four path, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and drew to even terms two deep toward the
head of the lane, remained a factor through the upper stretch but flattened later yards. SETTLEMENT DATE saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the
three eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn then flattened stride. RIP THORN raced well off the pace and showed little response while saving
ground. CHANGE YOUR LUCK raced with the early pace two deep but dropped back approaching the three eighths pole, gave chase from that point but
weakened off the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
SCOTCH NO ROCKS stalked the early pace from the two and three paths, challenged into the second turn and took the lead passing the half mile pole,
was urged clear toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn at the rail and just lasted in an all out drive. ONLY GET'N BETTER raced well off the early
pace in the two and three paths, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, eased to the six path rounding the far turn, dug in leaving the turn and just
missed in a strong finish. GET OFF MY CLOUD saved ground off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail,
eased outward leaving the turn and ran evenly in the lane. STRONG LIL KOKORO saved ground off the early pace, gave chase leaving the three eighths
pole and rounded the far turn five wide, steadied lightly passing the eighth pole then faded through the lane. MOON SIGN stalked the early pace then gave
chase passing the seven sixteenths pole, raced three wide through the far turn, was shut off in the vicinity of the eighth pole and weakened in the lane.
ROAD SLEW settled in the three and four paths and showed little response through the backstretch. LIL MR MATT moved to the inside and rated the early
pace, was met passing the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, but dropped back toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn.
The Stewards reviewed, then rejected, a claim of foul against the rider of Get Off My Cloud for alleged interference passing the eighth pole, lodged by the
rider of Strong Lil Kokoro.

Footnotes
CEDAR'S WISH broke awkwardly and exchanged contact with Alpine Moon then dueled for the lead approaching the three eighths pole and set a pressured
pace, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on the turn but dug in determinedly to edge away from the game challenge of FULL MOON
LOVER, who came away awkwardly and inward and made contact with ALPINE MOON then pressured the pace, contested the advantage two deep
rounding the turn but was met passing the eighth pole and reluctantly ceded the final sixteenth. The latter was squeezed back at the break then steadied
toward the half mile pole, picked up the chase from that point and rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the outside leaving the turn and finished
evenly to take third the final yards. MANAROLA had a brief early lead while setting a pressured pace but was met toward the three eighths pole and gave
chase from that point, raced in the four path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. SAYYESTOTHELADY engaged in close early chase inside but flattened
stride at the rail on the turn.

Footnotes
RIDE THE RAPIDS took over while tapering in and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, drifted
toward the head of the lane but dug in under steady handling and held on well. SECRET CASTLE stalked off the rail then gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, eased out toward the head of the lane then dueled through the stretch for second. A LITTLE BIT CRAZY
rounded the opening turn in the four path, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and entered the far turn in the three path, eased out nearing
the top of the lane and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. THE MONEY MACHINE rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the
seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and weakened in the lane. THUNDERTURTLE saved ground while well back early and could only
close the gap. SHERIFF'S KID settled in the two and three paths the first turn, gave chase passing the half mile pole but flattened stride in the five path on
the far turn.

chase toward the three eighths pole, had aim in the three path on the far turn but had to settle for second best. ROMAN CANDLE raced in the four path the
first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, dueled for third mid-stretch and held on. GIRLS PERFUME
settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then flattened stride. HERE'S A

rounded the far turn in the four and five paths and showed little further. PHILMARY CASTLE stalked two deep the first turn, challenged leaving the three
eighths pole but dropped back toward the quarter pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn.

Footnotes
ALEXANDER GRADY stalked inside then challenged toward the three eighths pole, dueled for the nod approaching the quarter, drew clear nearing the
head of the lane and was steadily handled while drawing away. GRANDPA JOE settled in the three path the first turn, started a bid leaving the half mile
pole, improved in the four path on the far turn and came along to take second inside the sixteenth pole. VALHALLA'S PALACE stalked from the three and
four paths, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path then flattened stride later yards. LORD CLANCY saved
ground on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened later yards. JUST MURPHY
rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. NOVEMBER
IMPERIUM came away awkwardly and exchanged contact with ESTRELLA FUGAZ then bore out into the first turn but quickly corrected course and could
only improve his position. The latter broke awkwardly and exchanged contact with November Imperium then closed to contention and rated a slim early
lead, dueled leaving the three eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, raced two deep on the far turn and weakened in the lane. COLONIAL
ROAD mostly saved ground. COURT TUDOR rounded the first turn about the five path, picked up the chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but
weakened in the three path on the far turn. MALEKES MAGIC rounded the first turn in the six path, left the turn outside, raced wide on the far turn and was
eased in the lane.
