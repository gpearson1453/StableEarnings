Footnotes
FASHION KING away in good order, pressed the issue up the backstretch from the outside, took over in the three path late in the turn, clear past the furlong
marker, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. GUCCI BOY lacked early foot toward the inside, three to four wide into the stretch, set down,
steadily gaining on the winner late. NOFURTHERQUESTIONS off the pace and the inside, moved closer four wide midway on the turn, chased the winner
past the furlong marker, had little more for that one to the wire, no match for the runner up, remained clear of the others. MACHO VILLA in the second flight
inside, came in the two path for the drive, lacked a serious closing response while improving slightly. ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR bumped at the start, raced back
and off rail, improved three wide midway on the bend, had little left for the stretch run. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN bumped with ANNIVERSAIRE D'OR at the
break, quickly recovered to move up and show the way up the backstretch along the inside, faltered when headed by the winner late in the turn. KANT
CONQUER ME shuffled back a bit along the rail into the turn, angled out to be five wide into the stretch, lacked a rally.

Footnotes
DESERT WOLF prompted the leader from the outside three wide through the first turn, continued to apply pressure under confident handling into the far
turn, took over late in the bend, drew clear under a steady hand ride past the furlong marker and was not threatened to the wire. BEN DREAMING away
best of all, showed the way through the first turn just off the inside, continued to set the pace up the backstretch, offered brief resistance to the winner exiting
the final turn, proved no match in the drive, remained comfortably clear of the others. TRAFFIC BOSS behind the pace while racing in the three path,
continued three wide through the second turn, lacked a serious closing response through the stretch. LEVY lacked early foot, angled out four wide turning
for home, mild late interest to improve position slightly. ASSET BASIS tracked the pace from along the inside, remained within striking distance to the two
leaders far turn, came up empty for the stretch run. STAR NATION last away, raced back, carried five wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally while
widest through the lane. POINT BLANK in the second flight on the outside and four wide first turn, weakened in the drive. HOWL YEAH finished early, was
far back, jogged in.

Footnotes
LEGENDARY LORE behind the pace inside, patiently handled behind some traffic through the second turn, between horses turning for home, bid soon
after, drove clear. DANCE SOME MO pressed first three wide first turn, dueled middle half mile, briefly clear into the stretch, proved no match for the winner
late, clearly second best. IGNITIS broke alertly, fell back off the leaders but remained within striking distance, tipped out three wide late in the final turn, went
flat through the final furlong to report home best of the rest. QUINCY MARKET in the second flight racing off the inside, lost some position while in the two
path inside of horses second turn, also went one paced the final furlong. MR. COUGAR broke back, lacked speed off the inside, two to three path second
turn, improved slightly. ASSUMPTION void of speed, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CHROME
RUN in mid pack and three to four wide, had little left for the drive. DOC HIGGINS set the early pace, dueled the middle half inside, stopped in the drive.
FIGHT'N READY stumbled badly at the break, unseated rider.

Footnotes
CONCEPT broke outward but alertly, dueled up front off the inside, continued to vie in the two path turn, shook off the other speed late in the turn, kicked
well clear under steady handling. DUTCH MILLS back off the pace and the inside, advanced in some traffic through the turn, proved no match for the winner
in the drive, held sway for the place. PRESSURE broke with the winner, dueled inside that one for a half, could not keep up into the stretch nor match the
runner, saved the show. LORD GRANTHAM broke out and back, lacked speed, saved ground through the turn, improved position while remaining inside of
horses. LAST OUTLAW within striking distance along the inside, in some traffic along the rail late in the turn, went evenly when clear for the drive.
PERMAFROST void of early foot, steered out two wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. LIFE ON THE NILE stalked the
pace while racing three wide, had little for the drive. HARD TO COME BY broke back, came three wide for the drive, failed to menace. RAHM in mid pack,
closer five to four wide in the turn, gave way. STUD LOVIN in mid pack early off the inside, shuffled back four wide into the turn, continued to fade.

HI YAH with the pace from the start, dueled into and through the turn off the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, held the runner up safe under
firm handling. HUSKER BUTCH lacked early foot, swung out five wide into the stretch, finished willingly down the strip to be closing the gap on the winner.
HOT TICKET off a step slow, moved out three wide turning for home, staged a belated rally to be in time for the show. GOLD BARON in mid pack off the
inside, four wide into the lacked closing kick. MEAN JAKEY in the the second flight two to three wide out of the turn, tired in the drive. ASPEN CLUB broke
back, failed to menace while off the inside. MIDNIGHT MAJESTY dueled up front closest to the inside, faltered through the stretch. CAPTAIN JACK staged
a steady retreat along the inside.

Footnotes
GALERIO forwardly placed outside., ranged up into contention three to four wide late in the final turn, dueled past the furlong marker on the outside, edged
clear late under firm handling and while drifting out. WINDCRACKER in the second flight, shuffled back in some traffic along the inside into the far turn,
came in the two path for the drive, finished up willingly while unable to get to the winner late. CHARTER OAK settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide
into the stretch, staged a mild rally to annex the show. DREWPOWER back off the pace and the inside, four to five wide out of the final turn, lacked a
closing kick to finish up evenly. MARTINI BLU broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, disposed of the other speed as the winner was moving to
challenge exiting the final turn, weakened gradually through the stretch. GALACTIC EMPIRE back off the pace and the inside, fanned six wide out of the
final bend, failed to muster a rally. GEORGIA DEPUTY off a step slow, trailed for six furlongs, four wide second turn, improved position by passing a few
tiring rivals, no real threat. NOMOREMRNICEGUY off a step slow, remained back in a lacking a closing bid. I'M CRENSHAW in the main body early, began
a steady fade before a half. THAT KHENNY dueled up front along the inside, began to give way midway on the final turn, continued to fade through the
stretch.

Footnotes
ALWAYS ANGELS outrun in the early going inside, begin to rally three to four wide into the stretch, closed with good resolve to be just up while between
foes at the end. FASHION RAGE back off the pace and the inside, advanced into contention three to four wide through the turn, put a head in front nearing
the furlong grounds, continued to hold a slight advantage to the wire, nipped from the outside while narrowly persevering for the second spot. SISTER
KISSES tracked the leaders towards but not on the inside, split foes when straightened for home, bid, outkicked in the late going while closest to the rail.
PATE lacked speed while racing outside the winner, came with that one while five wide for the drive, rallied down the middle of the strip, not enough late for
the place while widest of the first flight at the wire. BLAME DAY prompted the pace, three wide bid inside the winner and between rivals turning for home,
vied past the furlong marker, faltered. SHANGHAI EXPRESS lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground turn, improved slightly while not a serious
threat. DREAM STREAK chased the leader in the run up the backstretch, moved up to duel through the turn, gave way in the drive. LOFTHOUSE fell back
to to trail after the start and failed to menace. TWIRLING TIGRESS broke on top, sprinted clear to show the way up the backstretch, dueled turn along the
inside, backed up through the stretch. COLLECTED GLORY finished early, trailed home.

TAPATIO LEO sprinted well clear after the start, remained clear while lightly restrained through the turn, came in the three path for the drive, held the runner
up safe late under steady handling,. KNEEDEEPINSNOW in the second flight outside, moved closer four to five wide late in the turn, slowly cutting into the
winner's margin, proved game for the place. LIFE IS HARD headed up the second flight while racing three wide, also was cutting into the margin of the
winner late, outkicked for the second position. SPEND BENJAMINS lacked speed after being last to leave, angled out to be four wide turning for home,
improved position. TOP GUNNER in mid pack while three wide, steadied in traffic early in the turn, stalled, failed to rally after recovering. MANUELITO
lacked speed inside, continued to save ground far turn, came in the two path for the drive, made little impact in the run to the wire. ULTIMATE in the second
group while between horses for a half, weakened. TAHOE RUN staged a steady retreat along the inside.

Footnotes
VALENTINE CANDY prominent from the start outside, continued to prompt the issue in the four path into the turn, challenged on the outside exiting the
bend, edged clear late under steady handling. TIME FOR TRUTH broke on top, set the pace in the two path, remained just off the inside through the turn,
raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner until late, comfortably held the place. VITEMENT
pressed the issue up front while between the top two, fell off that pair nearing the furlong marker, comfortably saved the show. THE DONEGAL CLAN broke
out, bumped foe, settled behind the lead pack up the backstretch inside, crept slightly closer while continuing to save ground through the turn, lacked a
further response to finish up evenly. GOOGOL JOKE bumped, pinched to be off a step slow, raced three to four wide through the turn in the second flight,
lacked a closing kick. AMERICAN RASCAL brushed break, moved up into the second flight into the turn, three wide into the lane while between horses,
lacked a rallly.

Footnotes
DELTA MOON close from the start off the inside, took over in the two path midway on the turn, drew well clear through the stretch while being kept to task.
SUNNYANDSEVENTY in mid pack early, moved out, came five wide out of the turn when beginning to rally, chased the winner past the furlong marker, no
match for that one, held 2nbd late. MISS ARKANSAS off a step slow, moved outside, four wide through the turn, rallied outside the runner up, getting to that
one late. HONDURAS PASSION also away a step slow, also raced back early, two to three wide turn, traffic late in that bend, improved position when clear
for the drive. MISS MO MESA within striking distance behind the two leaders while three wide, came up empty for the drive. TWO BELLS in the main body
up the backstretch outside, four wide into the turn, three wide into the stretch, failed to muster a rally. MOENCHANTED forwardly placed for a half along the
inside, weakened. PALMILLA'S BET broke back, fell further back to trail, saved ground early turn, moved out three wide, improved by passing tiring rivals.
MO HOPEFUL broke on top, sprinted clear early, showed the way into the stretch, gave way when headed by the winner soon after. COSMIC CHIC fell
back into the turn, outrun to the wire. KAT'N CHROME in mid pack early, faded off the inside.
