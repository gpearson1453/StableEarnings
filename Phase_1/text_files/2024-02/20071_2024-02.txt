Footnotes
SMART JOKER dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and drew off in the lane. MIAH SAID bumped mildly with the horse
to her outside at the start, recovered to duel up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and chased that rival home. PERFECT MOON stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the turn from the three path
and kept on to the finish. SEAX raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground mildly in the lane. SIR
DANIEL chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and weakened in the stretch. GAMBITO raced off the pace on
the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and made no bid. GOOD BUMP tracked the leader between horses through the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and faded from there. SENSE OF GOLDEN bumped lightly with the horse to his inside at the start,
trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
