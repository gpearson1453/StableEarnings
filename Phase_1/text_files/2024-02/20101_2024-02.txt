Footnotes
TWIZZLE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and held clear to the wire. AWESOME ELISSA
bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack early, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the
stretch. ROADRUNNER THE CAT bumped mildly with the horse to her outside at the start, recovered to duel on the outside up the backstretch, continued
to battle from the three path around the bend, gave way in upper stretch and kept on from there. BEAUTIFULLYPERFECT raced off the pace between
horses early, continued around the turn in the three path and gained ground mildly in the lane. AUSTRIAN KITTY raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path and weakened in the stretch. RITEOFFIRSTREFUSAL hopped up leaving the gate, raced off
the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick. GRAND LADY INDY hit the gate leaving it,
bumping with the horse to her inside in the process, chased the leader up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the four path and faded in the
stretch. SOUTHERN COTTON bumped with the horse to her inside at the break, raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn
in the three path and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
RUBYSA chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, dueled in upper stretch and kicked clear. PURE
ELEGANCE raced off the pace on the outside early, swung out to the four path coming around the turn, began a bid in upper stretch and gained ground
late. ROYAL TO BE bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to lead the way between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around
the bend and was caught in the final furlong. JEFF'S ANGEL raced off the pace on the inside through the opening quarter, saved ground around the bend
and passed tiring horses in the stretch. AWESOME APEAL pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path and
weakened in the lane. LYRICAL tracked the leader up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and faded from there. MAMBO DANCER
stumbled leaving the gate, causing his rider to lose his stirrups, veered out to trail the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never
factored.
