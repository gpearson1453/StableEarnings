Footnotes
INTEGRATED was off slowly, showed no speed and raced four to five wide on the backstretch, advanced five wide by the quarter pole and came five wide
into the drive and closed well and after a couple left handed pops with the crop drew off to prove much the best. GURT'S WARRIOR stalked the early pace
and made a three wide bid on the far turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then was confronted leaving the furlong marker and proved to be no match for
the winner while clearly second best. HE AROSE was off a step slow, settled early and made a four wide move on the far turn but weakened, bested est.
LOUIE'S HEAT was in between rivals entering the first turn, then vied for the lead two wide and then in between rivals by the five sixteenths and then tired.
GREAT KOSTAS was well placed on the inside and tired. BROKENHEARTED vied for the lead on the inside and gave way. WATERMELON CRUSH was
reserved three wide and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MAGIC BEAUTY set the pace while three to two wide, then drew clear on the turn and drew off leaving the turn and then was geared down late to prove
much the best. JACK'S LILLY was reserved early on the inside, came two wide off the turn and split rivals leaving the furlong marker and rallied well to gain
the place award. ALWAYS MIA was rated along on the inside, then eased off the inside nearing the quarter pole and came four wide off the turn and
finished well. SIMPLE SOUVENIR was allowed to settle early, advanced outside by the quarter pole and came six wide into the lane and had a mild rally but
missed the show award. MELODIOUS SINGER stalked the pace three wide and weakened in the drive. BUSTIN DOWN DOORS was well placed on the
inside and weakened. UNION FOLLY was rated three wide and came five wide intro the lane and was empty. QUEEN ROSEMARY failed to menace.

Footnotes
FLINNY TIN TIN was well rated early, made a three wide move on the far turn to draw clear and move to the inside leaving the quarter pole, then remained
clear to prove best, driving. JOIA RARA tracked the pace on the inside, then made a bid on the turn two wide and then chased the winner home while
finishing willingly to be clearly second best. ZIFFY BUG was settled early, came four wide into the lane but lacked the needed rally, bested the rest.
SHE'SACHUBBLEMAKER was bumped at the start, settled back early, advanced three wide by the quarter pole and came five wide into the lane and
improved. CHEERFUL TROUT was reserved early, swung out three wide leaving the turn and was not a threat. LOOKING FANCY was void of early speed
and failed to respond. FOXEY G was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and stopped. THIRSTY FOR LOVE set the pace while clear
and wilted on the turn.
