brief lead mid-stretch but relented the final yards. JUBA'S PUNCH gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for
second. OUR BREW gave chase toward the inside, rounded the turn near the rail and dug in leaving the turn, but flattened stride later yards. MSSNAP

away on the far turn and held well under steady encouragement. RIVER MALBUMOONRVF rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure leaving the three
eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in to hold second. GREATANDGOOD raced off the rail the first
turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. MAGICAL SURPRISE stalked two
deep then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, but dropped back from between horses toward the quarter pole and flattened stride on the far turn.
CALYPSO JOHN settled in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn.

disadvantage in the three path on the far turn, dueled to a brief slim lead mid-stretch but was outfinished later yards. SMOKIN SMITTY stalked inside on the
first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, took a slim lead nearing the three eighths pole, drew briefly clear past the quarter but was met at the rail
midway on the far turn and weakened mid-stretch. EAST TO BEAST had a brief early lead then stalked the pace, gave chase toward the three eighths pole
but weakened in the three path on the far turn. J G JETT took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and rated the early pace, came under pressure

THE SKY IS FALLING settled in the four path the opening turn and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole and
improved in the four path on the far turn, took the nod passing the eighth pole, ran briefly clear in later yards and just held on. GINGER GIRL stalked off the
rail the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, angled out entering the stretch and dug in to take
second the final yards while gaining on the winner. EXTRA CRUNCHY stalked from the three path the first turn then took a slim lead into the backstretch,
dueled from that point and rounded the far turn off the rail, was met entering the stretch then flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. SAVE THE FLAG
settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three and four paths on the far turn, angled widest entering the
stretch and passed rivals in an even finish. BRAVO ZULU set the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and remained a close factor through the
backstretch, but steadied at the rail past the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. BARBERS POINT stalked inside on the first turn, gave chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, raced two deep on the far turn and weakened. SUPER COOL STORM raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn
outside and showed little response.

STOP BEING GREEDY settled inside on the first turn, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and steadily progressed from that point, raced near the
rail on the far turn, came inside the drifting Cajun Joe leaving the turn, dug in for the lead mid-stretch and dueled clear later yards. CASSIUS saved ground
off the pace, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and closed the gap off the rail on the far turn, was carried out leaving the turn then outfinished in
the duel through the stretch. CAJUN JOE took a quick lead and moved to the inside to show the way, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail, but drifted approaching the head of the lane and flattened stride. DR JACK FLYER settled off the rail the first turn, gave
chase passing the half mile pole, drifted outward and made light contact with TAPPEDWITHSUCCESS midway on the far turn and flattened stride. The
latter rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase from the three eighths pole, was brushed lightly midway on the far turn and flattened stride.
BESOTTED raced in the four path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in the three path on the far turn. RING
FUND was not a factor.

Footnotes
WAVERLEY saved ground racing well back from early contention, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and angled outward on the far turn, left the
turn about the six path, dug in under steady handling and got up the final strides. SKYLAR'S SISTER stalked off the rail, gave chase past the seven
sixteenths pole and dueled to the lead past the eighth pole, dug in leaving the turn but was caught in the final strides. PUSH stalked from the three path,
gave chase passing the half mile pole and rounded the far turn about the four path, dug in leaving the turn and dueled through later yards for third.
CHANNEL SCENT raced well off the pace and off the rail the opening turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced two deep on the far
turn, ran evenly in the stretch and missed the nod for third. MANITOULIN ISLAND raced well back about the four path the first turn, left the turn outside and
gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and passed rivals outside. LA CORONA broke awkwardly and raced well off
the pace and off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened stride off the rail on the far turn. PALMARY ducked
outward and made contact with WICKED SAUCY leaving the gate then moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure past the seven
sixteenths pole, contested the advantage nearest the rail on the far turn but was caught passing the eighth pole and gave way. The latter was bumped
leaving the gate then steadied early and saved ground, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. LADY CINCO
DE MAYO saved ground.
