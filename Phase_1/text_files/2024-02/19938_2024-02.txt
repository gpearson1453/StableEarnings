Footnotes
BABY SOX set the pace along the inner rail, readily pulled away through the stretch and was under brisk urging in mid stretch. FIVECOMMATWO , a
forward factor in the two path around the turn and in the stretch, chased the winner in a willing effort. CATCH THE KITTEN raced inside horses on the turn,
was in the two path chasing the winner in the stretch and finished wilingly. POLICE WOMAN lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn and
through the stretch and passed tired horses. MAIL CALL , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, weakened in the drive. CANDY ARCADE , angled
in leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn and gave way. HONOR THE TRUTH was outrun. KELLY'S PARTY GIRL , fractious in the
starting gate, was outrun and circled the turn three wide. FLITTER broke sluggishly, raced three wide in mid pack on the turn and faltered. BIZZY BIZZY
pulled up lame in upper stretch and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LISA'S PALACE , perched three wide under rating tracking the dueling leaders into the turn, moved three deep in hand to take over near the three eighths,
dropped in a bit when cruising clear soon after, opened up when put to firm asking in upper stretch then maintained a safe advantage while being kept alert.
FLOGE hopped at the break and was away last, regrouped and moved up to the outside of a rival, pursued under coaxing mid turn, shifted four wide into the
stretch, advanced outside runners nearing mid stretch and finished up with good energy to bridge the gap. FAINOR'S FILETS disputed the early pace
outside KAPATUDE, saw the leader roll past leaving the three eighths, stayed on to pursue three wide into the stretch, kept on with effort past mid stretch
then faded late. SUPER FABULOUS , two wide early, dropped in towards the rail and was pushed along mid turn, remained inside through the drive but
lacked a response. FUNZALO , off the pace and off the inside, came four wide for the drive but failed to drum up a rally. KAPATUDE broke inward and
bumped with a rival, corrected and vied inside a rival, remained a presence to upper stretch then faded. BOOTSY'S MERLOT , bumped at the break, raced
off the pace while saving ground, was under a ride mid turn, eased out into the lane, edged up behind rivals leaving mid stretch, steadied briefly then altered
out late.

Footnotes
ROYAL SPY took over between rivals early, spurted clear under rating heading to the turn, was nicely handled around the turn, came under a ride while
guide three wide in upper stretch, opened up under a solid drive in mid stretch then held firm while kept to task. CLASS ACTOR , with the pace four wide
outside rivals, stalked three deep past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase four wide into and through the lane, switched over to his left lead late and
remained clear of the rest. PATRIOTIC PARTY saved ground while in range early, eased back a bit into the turn, saved ground under coaxing into the
stretch, altered out off heels near the sixteenth marker, worked between runners and churned on to grab the show. UNLEVERAGED , off the pace while
three deep leaving the far turn, raced wide for the drive and offered a mild kick. BERMONDSEY away alertly, forced the early pace between rivals, chased
between horses past the five sixteenths, kept on with effort to mid stretch and faded late. BERNIE'S ON FIRE was rated back while saving ground nearing
the half mile pole, made a steady rail run nearing the quarter pole, eased out soon into the lane, shifted back in with pursuit, failed to kick on in mid stretch
and weakened. GRAND MANNER , forward early between horses, dropped back around the turn.

WHATAHARDMANFIDEAD , patiently handled down the backstretch, moved up in the three path leaving the turn, eased over to the four path in upper
stretch, closed inside MY ENDEAVOR, led late and drove clear. MY ENDEAVOR stalked the pace, circled foes four wide leaving the turn, gained the lead in
upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and failed to hold off the winner. HOW U DOIN saved ground around the turn, eased off the rail turning for
home, steadied behind horses in upper stretch then passed faders. SIR PALACE PRINCE prompted the pace three wide, gained a short lead entering the
stretch and tired in the drive. HOMECOMING KING , sluggish to begin, showed late interest and passed tired foes. TIZAWINNER lacked speed, was five
deep turning for home and failed to rally. SEEKER showed speed along the inner rail and gave way through the stretch. NO WORRIES raced along the
inner rail down the backstretch and faltered after a half mile. JACK CLOUD had speed in the two path between horses and faltered in upper stretch.

into the turn, edged up to take aim past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase past the three sixteenths, drifted in a bit and came up empty. DISPUTED

COUNTRYCLUB COUPLE prompted the pace outside DESTINATION, overtook that one leaving the turn, was under brisk urging in the stretch and drew
off. DESTINATION showed speed along the inner rail, battled with the winner to upper stretch then gradually weakened. SOCIETY BALL lacked speed,
circled foes three wide on the turn and had a mild rally outside rivals. CHAMPAGNE DANCE saved ground on the turn, eased off the rail turning for home
and flattened out between horses. AMIE'S SYMPHONY raced along the inner rail on the turn, eased out, swung to the six path approaching the sixteenth
pole and failed to menace. ENEMYNUMBERNINE lacked speed, was three wide on the turn, moved to the six path in mid stretch and showed some late
interest. HATEFUL , steadied in close quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, was not a factor. A P M NOTION , reluctant to load into the starting
gate, steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, chased the pace for a half mile then gave way.

Footnotes
MUSICAL HEART , patiently handled tracking the pace three wide, moved up three deep in hand to engage leaving the far turn, put a head in front nearing
the quarter pole, responded when put to firm asking in upper stretch, eagerly drew away and was kept to pressure to the wire. BAHAMA CHANNEL ,
sluggish from the gate, moved up under a hustling ride and outside a rival around the turn, shifted out four wide for the drive, straightened away and finished
up with good energy to be second best. CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO prompted the pace two wide under a bit of coaxing, was sent up between rivals near
the three eighths to challenge, sparred to the head of the lane, failed to quicken with the winner past the three sixteenths then faded through the final fifty
yards. ROCKY DICE , off the pace, angled five wide for the drive and passed fading rivals. BIG HAMBONE sped clear early and secured the inside, was
joined by a pair of foes leaving the far turn, battled to the head of the land then weakened in mid stretch. ZIPPER ZAPPER , bumped at the break, chased in
the clear while saving some ground mid turn, angled out for the drive and faded. CLASSY SOLUTION , off slow after being put in tight at the break, raced off
the pace, circled very wide into the lane and failed to menace. OBOY , bumped at the break, was urged along while saving ground mid turn and weakened.

drove clear. DOLLARIZATION stalked the duel outside horses, advanced three wide leaving the turn, gained a short, four wide lead in upper stretch and
finished gamely. COWAN hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to the eighth pole and faded. GREELEY AND BEN lacked speed, swung wide in upper
stretch and offered a late, mild gain. BROTHER CONWAY bobbled leaving the starting gate, dueled outside COWAN and gave way the final furlong.

Footnotes
VALLEYSHARK broke a bit slow, accelerated inside to a forward spot leaving the chute, worked outward floating out a rival near the five sixteenths,
straightened away about four wide, closed in under pressure, forged to command leaving mid stretch then drew clear. RETURN FIRE grabbed command
early, set the pace towards the inside, dug in when confronted in mid stretch then gave way grudgingly while well clear for the place. NAUGHTY STREAK
tracked inside mid turn then lacked a solid finish. CORONATION TIME , sluggish from the gate, lagged back, raced five wide in upper stretch and offered a
belated response. MINIMO , three wide, was urged along chasing past the three eighths, was herded out nearing the lane and gave way. MINNY
SPEIGHTSTER bobbled at the break, regrouped and prompted outside the leader, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. A B C YA , three
wide, gave way. THUNDERSLAM , between rivals into the turn, tired.
