Footnotes
IMAPEPPA set the pace in the three path, merged to the rail going into the turn, was roused while tipping back out to the three path at the top of the stretch,
kicked clear on his left lead approaching the sixteenth, and held safely. RED ABARRIO tracked in the two path, was coaxed from the four path turning into
the lane, tipped outward and bumped with an outer foe around the sixteenth, but ran on to hold place. WEEKEND CONCERTO stalked between foes in the
three path, was cued passing the quarter, swung out to the seven path at the top of the lane, tipped inward slightly on his left lead and bumped with an inner
foe around the sixteenth, but kept on for show. FIRST SHOT FIRED raced off the pace in the three path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning
into the stretch, and mildly stayed on. KUWAIT TOWERS chased inside, came under a drive in the two path passing the quarter, but made no impact.
DANELAND trailed from the three to four paths early and never threatened. ALWAYS DIALED prompted the pace in the five path, bid in the three path
around the turn, but weakened while back in the five path in the stretch.

Footnotes
THIS DUDE A BREEZE saved ground in range, angled three wide in upper stretch, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead under
a drive. CURLIN'S KITTEN bumped with BOURBON CLEARANCE not long after the start, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, saved ground
around the far turn, tipped back out in midstretch and rallied between foes to gain the place. ONE BITE pressed the pace two wide, kept on through the lane
but was outfinished. NOBLE TIGER set the pace along the rail, led to the sixteenth pole and yielded. BARRY THE BUILDER was bumped at the start,
bumped again soon after, saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. PHOBIA failed to menace while racing four
wide. ASSERTIVE ATTITUDE chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. SELASSIE stalked the pace three wide and weakened through the lane.
TUFNEL played no factor while racing two and three wide. FRANKIEBLUEEYES was outrun inside. BOURBON CLEARANCE broke inwardly and bumped
a foe at the start, was bumped on both sides soon after, clipped heels, lost the rider, galloped along riderless and walked off. THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO ALTER THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

from the four path at the top of the stretch, and went clear under a drive. BOLDNESS bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the two path, was
coaxed while tipping out to the four path early into the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and chased on for place. SLIM MAN

Footnotes
NOVO SOL (BRZ) laid up close in the three path, bid in hand midway around the far turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch, tipped back
inward while taking the lead passing the eighth pole, went clear passing the sixteenth, and held safe. READ ON stalked in the two path, was ridden around
the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. PUBLIC SECTOR (GB) laid off the pace in the three path turning into the
backstretch, was coaxed along the inside early around the far turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and finished evenly for show.
VLADISLAV showed the way around the first turn to set the pace inside down the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, floated out to the four
path entering the stretch, but faded in the final furlong.

RHUM SAINT ESPRIT pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the eighth pole, dueled outside to the wire and prevailed. EASTBOSTONBENNY set
a pressured pace along the rail, was collared near the eighth pole, fought on gamely in tight quarters inside of the winner and just missed. SNIPER JACK
was bumped at the start, chased the top two finishers in the three path, could not gain on those foes but held on for the show. SHARP WONDER went
evenly while racing two wide. STICKY MCSHNICKENS chased the pace four wide and lacked a rally. MASTER MUNNINGS played no factor while racing
two wide. OCALA ROCKET had only brief speed inside. HALVERSON was bumped at the start and never got involved while racing in the three path. AN
OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF EASTBOSTONBENNY AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS
NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
MEGAN MAKIN MONEY pressed in the three path, bid confidently midway around the turn, took the lead while being cued from the six path at the top of the
stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. ALA TURKA broke out and bumped an outer foe, rated in the three path, was cued while fanning out to the eight
path turning into the stretch, and rallied for place. BLAZINGLY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was coaxed early into the
turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, drifted in thru the final sixteenth, and held show. SIX FEET APART bumped with an inner foe at the start, set
the pace in the two path, tipped out to the three path under a ride turning into the lane, but faded in the final furlong. AMERICAN GAMBLE broke in and
bumped an inner foe, raced off the pace in the five path, floated out to the seven path in upper stretch, but was one paced. BARBARA broke in and bumped
an inner foe, raced wellback in the four path, tipped inwards down the stretch, and made no impact. FEDALIA bumped at the start with an outer foe, chased
in the three path, was driven between foes around the turn, appeared to be finishing evenly, but had to steady late. DEMURELY got squeezed back at the
start, trailed along the inside and failed to menace. MAGIC MOONSTAR bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked inside but weakened down the lane.

HURRICANE DEBBIE bobbled at the start, trailed in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, and rallied inside of foes while still in the two path
down the lane to get up in the final strides. BEACHLAND chased in the three path, swung from the five path under a drive turning into the stretch, and ran
on for place. QUEEN KARIMA set the pace in the two path, was coaxed approaching the quarter, opened up from three path in upper stretch but was
caught on both sides in the final strides to show. KICK A RHYME (IRE) rated inside, was cued while fanning out to the seven path turning into the lane, and
stayed on. SERGEANT MOLLY pressed in the four path, bid passing the quarter, but drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, and did not factor.
PEACH COBBLER tracked in the three path, was cued from the two path midway around the turn, angled out to the five path passing the eighth pole, but
made no impact. THREE POLKS stalked in the five path but weakened between foes in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLACK BELT bumped with CLASSIC CAR WASH at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, took over near the three-eighths pole and drew off
under a mild drive. LURE HIM IN raced in range two wide, was ridden along four wide around the far turn, could not keep pace with the winner but kept on
for the place. INSTANT COFFEE was pinched back at the start, trailed inside early, circled four wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. X Y POINT
set the pace inside and weakened in the lane. CLASSIC CAR WASH was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three wide, made progress three wide
around the far turn but faded in the stretch. DAI VERNON failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BARBER ROAD raced in range two and three
wide and came up empty in the lane. COOKE CREEK played no factor while racing four wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn.
TWELVE VOLT MAN raced three wide in midpack early, saved ground around the far turn and had little left for the drive. MERLIN steadied midway around
the first turn, saved ground in range but was through after a half.

Footnotes
HONOR D LADY stalked in the five path down the backside, came under a ride to bid early into the far turn, stuck her head in front with a quarter mile left to
run, kicked away in the three path at the top of the short stretch, and held sway. SOUL OF AN ANGEL laid off the pace along the rail, was ridden in the two
path around the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. MARYQUITECONTRARY rated in the three path, was cued
from the four path into the far turn, angled out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. TIZZY IN THE SKY bumped with an inner foe
at the start, chased in the six path, fanned out to the nine path under right handed encouragement turning into the stretch, but finished evenly. LIBBAN
bumped with foes on both sides at the start, prompted the pace in the four path, took the lead and was coaxed from the three path into the far turn, but lost
the lead midway around the far turn, and faded in the five path down the lane. NOSTALGIC bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed in the five path
turning into the lane and made no impact. IMONRA bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid in midpack out in the six path down the backside, was roused
into the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. OPUS FORTY TWO tracked in the three path, was ridden into the far turn, but failed to bid. MAGICAL LUTE
raced wellback in the three path turning into the backstretch and never threatened. YUKI (CHI) bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace in the two
path but gaveway along the rail around the far turn.
