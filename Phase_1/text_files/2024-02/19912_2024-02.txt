Footnotes
LAVINIA SPIRIT was bumped at the start, then went up to set the pace while clear and on the inside, opened up the margin on the turn, then drew off in the
lane under right handed crop urging to prove much the best. DANCING BEAUTY broke outward and bumped the winner at the start, tracked the pace in
between rivals, then bested foe in the lane to be second best. PROBLEMS ABOUND tracked the pace on the inside and lacked the needed winning bid
while being outkicked for the place award, bested others. REZQUIA was settled early, three wide on the turn, came five wide into the lane and improved late
for the last spot in the superfecta. WARRIOR BERNICE tracked the early pace on the outside, three wide on the turn and came four wide off the turn and
was empty. CHEERFUL TROUT was settled on the inside and was not a threat. HURRICANE BON was void of any speed and far back and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
SILVERBULLETTWENTY was allowed to settle early on the inside, eased out on the turn and came five wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get
up late to prove best, driving. CALLIN MY NAME set a pressured pace three wide early, then was two wide on the turn and made a bid to shake clear by the
furlong marker but was caught in deep stretch. PARTY AT SAM'S pressed the pace on the inside and fought on to the wire but was outfinished by the top
two, held show award. CALI HEAT chased the pace and made a three wide bid off the turn but hung late. MON GATEAU was reserved early, saved ground
on the turn and lacked a rally. BOLD FORCE was outrun early and was never a factor.

MOON WARRIOR was bumped at the start, reserved early, made a inside middle move to be in contention entering the turn, then eased out to make a
three wide bid off the turn and slowly drew clear in the final furlong to prove best under a drive. DORSODURO set the early pace and then drew out to
widened the margin leaving the nine sixteenths, then was headed leaving the furlong marker and fought on to the wire to be clearly second best. LONG
TOM was reserved early, advanced entering the far turn but steadied by the three eighths marker, then made a mild bid on the inside leaving the turn and
bested rest. SOUL STORY was off a step slow, settled back early, made a five wide advanced on the far turn and came five wide into the lane and improved
late. VOTETHEMALLOUT was four wide into the first turn, tracked the early pace three wide and tired. DON'T QUESTION ME chased the early pace on the
inside, shifted out entering the backstretch, made a mild advance three wide on the far turn and then weakened. LAWLESSNESS was five wide into the first
turn, settled early, then made way to the inside entering the far turn and tired. KABOD stalked the early pace on the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
DIVINE GRACE set the early pace while in the two path, was well handled and was asked leaving the turn and drew off in the drive to prove much the best
after a few flags and then was hand ridden to the wire to proved much the best. GRYPHON'S WINGS prompted the pace three wide and then proved no
match for the winner in the lane while winning the battle for the place award. MO TOUGH was well placed on the inside and lacked the needed winning bid,
out-kicked for the place award. REACHING STRIDE was rated along early, moved up between rivals leaving the five eights marker, then was four wide by
the quarter pole and weakened. UGHROUDA chased the pace three wide, then was two wide on the far turn and tired. RIGHTOFFTHEBENCH was settled
on the inside and failed to respond.

BAZOO prompted the pace from the outside, made a three wide bid on the turn to set the pace and drew clear leaving the turn and then maintained a safe
margin to the wire to prove best, driving. HOPE FOR GOLD was settled early, moved up between rivals on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn
and closed well to gain the place award. MY BLUE EYES was away alertly to set the early pace on the inside, then stalked the pace on the inside by the
quarter pole, angled off the inside by the furlong marker and missed the place award. REFUND RIGLER stalked the pace three wide, then lugged in by the
three sixteenths, then was corrected and then had to steady leaving the furlong marker slightly and faded late. Jockey of Refund Rigger claimed objection
against My Blue Eyes and stewards ruled no change. NAUTICAL NATURE chased the early pace four wide, shuffled back on the turn and had no rally.
JIMMY THE KID chased the pace on the inside and weakened. LUCKYTOBEINAMERICA failed to menace. SCREEN STAR was squeezed back at then
start, made a five wide advance on the turn and then was empty.

FEE prompt the early pace from the outside, took aim through the far turn and finished with good energy to edge clear under steady pressure. SHERO
pressed the early pace while racing between horses, dug in late to keep on to narrowly secure the second place finish. MOONSAFE stumbled at the break,
raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, advanced through the far turn into the stretch and moved up racing four deep to improve position.
KNOWING GLANCE settled off the early pace, race five wide near the three sixteenths pole and was even late. WINKIWINKI chased two deep and
weakened in the drive. EMPRESS DEONA was sent along to a clear lead near the rail and faded in the drive. DATE NIGHT KISSES raced off the early
going, swung five wide into the lane and never menaced.

Footnotes
GANDY DANCING was squeezed at the break, raced off the early going after the poor start, angled five wide in the lane and got up to prove best under
strong pressure. INDIRECTLY chased the early pace three deep and kept on gamely to the wire. SILENT TIGER set an early pace near the rail, duel
through the turn, came out a bit near the sixteenths pole, bothered foe and was disqualified after a jockeys objection by Rapid Response. RAPID
RESPONSE bumped at the start, duel through the far turn, in tight near the sixteenth pol and finished gamely to the wire. A T M AWESOME stalked the
pace along the inside and had no final winning bid. COAST TO COAST settled early, raced four to five wide and had no late response. SUNNY SAINT
dropped back early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly to the wire. CACTUS JACK was off slowly, dropped back and failed to respond.
SOUPER CATCH void of early speed, raced three to four wide and never threatened. AGAINST THE ODDS raced near the inside and lacked a bid.
