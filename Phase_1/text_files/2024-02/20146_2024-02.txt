Footnotes
MOTSKARI saved ground around the first turn, raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the three path,
raced into traffic while beginning a bid nearing the quarter pole, bumping with both BEAR HUNT and JOSH'S DRAMA in the process, continued to race into
tight quarters in upper stretch, veering out sharply at the eighth pole to find racing room and interfering with THAT MAGIC MOMENT, gained ground on the
outside, came in again to brush with BEAR HUNT near the wire and kicked clear from there. BEAR HUNT raced in the two path early, tracked the leader on
the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the second turn, raced in tight quarters, bumping with MOTSKARI passing the
quarter pole, dueled in the lane from there, was bumped again by MOTSKARI in late stretch when that rival came over while passing and chased on to the
wire. JOSH'S DRAMA raced in the two path around the first turn, led the way on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far bend still in the
two path, raced in tight quarters and bumped with MOTSKARI entering the stretch and kept on in the lane. SKYLANE bumped mildly with the horse to his
outside at the start, raced in the four path early, settled off the pace up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and never threatened.
THAT MAGIC MOMENT raced in the four path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack between horses, came around
the far turn still in the four path, was cut off and forced to check at the eighth pole when MOTSKARI veered into his lane, bumped with that rival in the
process and was outkicked from there. LAST RUN saved ground around the first turn, pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back
while saving ground around the second bend and continued to tire in the lane. STRAY PRINCE bumped lightly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate,
trailed the field from the three path through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and was never a factor. THE TRAINER OF
HORSE FOUR, BEAR HUNT, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE TWO, MOTSKARI, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE RIDER OF
