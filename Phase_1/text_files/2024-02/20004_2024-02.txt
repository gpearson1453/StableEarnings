Footnotes
MANLY DEEDS tracked in the four to three path, sustained a grinding charge to reel in the leader in the final sixteenth and held form an outer bidder at the
wire. PESO PESADO settled off of the pace in the three path, tipped four wide entering the lane, rallied to offer a late bid but narrowly came up short.
DUVEE had his hind heels clipped while clearing into the first turn, showed they way before an outer foe applied pressure into the far turn, shook free of that
one entering the lane, but met challenges in the final sixteenth and gave in late. BIG BOO steadied between horses entering the first turn, tracked along the
inside and offered a rail chase. TAMBOURINE STAR prompted inside of the leader early on, backed out but clipped that ones hind heels whlie tipping out
entering the first turn, stalked in the three to two path, pressed the leader into the far turn, but faded between horses entering the lane. CAJUN AMI steadied
out of tight quarters inside of rivals nearing the first turn, trailed, moved out of last in the four path nearing the lane and made little impact. THE BOSS SOSS
pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, checked entering the backstretch and steadily faded.

Footnotes
CANADA'S CUSTOMS stalked along the inside, loomed up outside of the leading pair to bid entering the lane, sparred with an inner game rival through the
final furlong and prevailed in the head-bob at the wire. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN took contact from an inner rival at the start, vied three wide, dueled two wide into
and around the turn, vied as an outer rival joined the fray entering the lane, led with three sixteenths to go, gamely clung to advantage from his outer
counterpart into deep stretch, but missed the bob at the wire. CAJUN NINJA dueled for the lead along the inside, gave way to the top pair with three
sixteenths to go and lasted for show. LOUISIANA LIBERTY broke slowly, trailed along the inside, shfited to the five path entering the lane and made little
impact. FOURALIVIA broke outwardly and bumped a rival, prompted between the top pair through the opening furlong, failed to keep pace approaching the
half mile pole, chased in the three path around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
DROP DEAD SEXY set a clear pace in the three path, shifted inwardly passing the furlong grounds as an inner rival offered a bid, sparred with that one
while tiring through the final sixteenth, yet lasted via a head-bob. COUNTRY LADY stalked the clear leader from the two path, took aim inside of that one in
upper stretch, bid while put to a bit of tight rail quarters inside the final furlong, vied through the late stages but hung and missed vie a head-bob. OURS
AND THEIRS chased inside, shifted to the three path while closing in on the tiring leading pair in the final furlong, but failed to bid while staving off an outer
bidder for show. MISS KENNEDY laid off of the pace along the inside, rallied belatedly shifting to the four path entering the final sixteenth and missed
reaching show. ISOLATION moved forward in the four path to midpack into the turn, tucked to the two path turning for home, chased in the three path in
upper stretch, but was outkicked for minor placings while drifting to the five path in the final furlong, and lacked a bid. GALAXY THIRTYSIX raced towards
the rear in the four to five path and failed to menace. MO BLING laid off of the pace two wide and between horses and failed to factor. HALF PAGE chased
three wide, but faded between horses nearing the turn.

Footnotes
CANDY BAR pressed outside of the leader, drifted to the four path entering the lane, bid hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, vied while wandering and
drifting in and out through midstretch, changed to his right lead entering the final sixteenth and drew clear. FIESTA BESTA set the pace along the inside,
met an outer challenge in upper stretch, dug in and vied with that drifting foe through midstretch, but yielded entering the final sixteenth and lasted for place.
RUBIA bumped an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two wide, split foes in the three path in upper stretch, ran on vying for show with an inner foe
through the final furlong, forged that position and missed reaching place. RILEY JEAN stalked along the inside, chased in the two path in upper stretch, vied
for show with an outer rival through the final furlong but was bested. MS. LILIBET pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, shifted to the four
path entering the lane and chased among foes. GOLDYS LOCK was bumped by an inner foe at the start, saved ground in midpack, but to no avail.
STEPHS COAST was reluctant to load, tracked three wide, floated to the five path entering the lane and gave way. ART DECO lacked speed along the
inside, shifted out in upper stretch but lacked a rally. LYNNA brushed the inner part of the gate while breaking awkwardly, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HOODLUM tracked two wide, ranged up outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid entering the lane in the four path, forged a narrow advantage in
upper stretch and maintained that margin from his game inner counterpart thereafter. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG) showed the way inside of a prompting rival,
got headed by a wider bidder in upper stretch, then fought on grudgingly through the final furlong but was fended off. MY BARILEY lacked speed along the
inside, crept closer in the four path around the far turn before swinging to the seven path entering upper stretch, offered a grinding charge to slowly close in
through the final furlong, but needed more to reel in the top pair. YES POINT stalked along the inside, took aim inside of the leaders in upper stretch, but
hung on his left lead and lacked a rail punch. NORDIC LIGHT laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane but failed to rally
between horses. FABLED RULER trailed and surpassed tiring rivals. ROOSTER RUN lacked speed along the inside and was through early. BLURT
brushed an outer rival at the start, pressed the leader from the three path, but weakened between horses entering the lane and readily stopped.

Footnotes
Z Z'S PRINCE rated well back tucking from the five to two path around the first turn, pursued in the four path around the far turn before swinging to the
seven path entering the lane, then rallied widest to bid outside of the leaders in the final sixteenth before edging clear. PROFESSOR HIGGINS took contact
from an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked under intermittent rousing in the three to two path and among foes around
the far turn, shfited in nearing the three sixteenths marker to launch a rail rally, progressed to bid inside of the leader entering the final sixteenth, but was
outkicked by a wider on-charging foe late. MAURITIUS showed the way around both turns, shook free entering the lane in the two path, flopped back to his
left lead after drifting out slightly nearing the final sixteenth, and was caught by bidders on both sides in the late stages. BILLY'S GOT ISSUES tracked along
the inside, pursued between horses into the far turn, took aim on the newly clear leader while shifting to the two to three path in upper stretch, but only
managed to chase before getting outkicked for minor placings with a sixteenth to go. UNDER SURVEILLANCE laid off of the pace along the inside, then two
wide around the far turn and ran on willingly. FIRST CLASS HARLOW tracked two to three wide, floated to the five path entering the lane and chased
evenly. HE GOTS TO GO leaned inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, trailed, took the far turn in the three path, moved to the five to six path in
midstretch and improved late. GLUCKSTADT lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. MONJID stalked three to two wide, chased getting
floated to the four path in upper stretch and weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. LIQUID ADDICTION (IRE) lacked speed in the four to two
path early on, then shifted from the four path to the six path entering the lane and lacked a rally. RONIC stalked along the inside but weakened entering the
far turn.

Footnotes
SISTER ELLA showed the way in the two path before tucking tot eh inside into the turn, then drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch before being
put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. A MISS DEAMEANOR prompted inside of the leader early on, chased that one into and around the turn, dug in for
place and held that position through the final furlong. JET ROCKET tracked from midpack in the four path, ranged up to bid for place nearing the lane, vied
for that position through midstretch, but was turned away. MOION came in at the start, trailed in the three path before advancing between horses into the
turn, progressed fanning five wide turning for home, but leveled off and prevailed for fourth. ABOUT TO SET SAIL was floated inwardly while off slow at the
start, pursued from behind the main group and along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and chased between horses to miss fourth. GRABIQ lacked
speed along the inside and failed to factor. GIRL LIKES BLING chased forwardly two wide and between horses, but weakened nearing midstretch.
STEPHANIE'S MARIA leaned outwardly while off a step slow at the start, raced at the rear in the four to three path around the turn and made little impact.
TENSAS LUCY stalked three wide, but gave way between horses approaching the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
STIFF DRINK tracked from off of the pace in the three to four path, took aim in the five path entering the lane, bid in midstretch and drew clear.
INFINITESIMAL lacked speed in the four path, quickly surpassed inner rivals entering the far turn to bid for the lead with five sixteenths to go, led nearing
the lane, but was bested by an outer foe in midstretch and held place. GOBOT lacked speed in the two path, pulled behind rivals nearing the backstretch,
shifted out to the five path and tugged forward outside of foes with nine sixteenths to go, bid at the half mile pole, vied two wide and between horses around
the far turn, but was headed by an outer rival turning for home, then kept on. AMERICAN DOLLARS tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind
foes around the far turn to be towards the rear nearing the lane, shifted out four wide in upper stretch and came again between horses. PUNCHIE tracked in
the two path, then in the three path and between horses approaching the far turn, prompted among rivals around that bend, but yielded entering the lane.
DOUBLE ON THE RED trailed, swung to the eight path entering the lane and moved up. TRUE CRIMSON broke through the gate pre-race, stalked two
wide, chased while getting shuffled behind the tiring early pace-setter around the far turn, and lacked a re-rally. LIL WOADIE pursued from midpack along
the inside, lost position before chasing from well back in the five path around the far turn and failed to factor. COCAL set the pace, but was headed by outer
bidders around the far turn and weakened.
