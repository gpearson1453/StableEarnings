Footnotes
CAJUN GUMBOW prompted two wide, sparked a duel turning for home, drove clear in the final furlong and held from a late outer bidder. WHAT CAN I SAY
bumped with an outer rival soon after the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to gain place in the final
sixteenth but ran out of ground to reel in the leader. CCED FOR STEPH set the pace inside of a prompting foe, sparred with that one turning for home,
dueled through midstretch but gave in a sixteenth from home. CRYPTO BRAVE pursued from midpack along the inside then chased the leaders through the
lane. LOYAL TO THE CHIEF chased in the four path and lacked a bid hanging on his left lead. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS lagged behind along the inside into
the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and moved up. KATIE'S C bumped with an inner rival early on, then saved ground well back to no avail. WHY WAIT
pursued from midpack in the three path and between foes, but gave way. MYDEALOFTHEDAY chased from midpack in the five path and faded. SADIE'S
RANSOM stalked closest to the top pair and from the three path, but weakened between horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
WISE ANCHOR tracked from the two path, rallied to drive past the leader approaching midstretch and drew clear. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER bumped with
an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole and fended off an outer rival thereafter.
WIN YA WIN lacked speed four to six wide, rallied to take aim on place in the final sixteenth but was kept at bay. BIBLEMAN set the pace, built a clear
margin into the turn, but was caught by an outer bidder approaching midstretch and weakened. MUCHO MARVIN bumped with an outer rival at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three path at the quarter pole and lacked a bid between horses. NORTHERNREFLECTION saved
ground off of the pace but to no avail. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN tracked in the three to four path around the turn before fading between horses. FIERY
PLAYBOY broke a bit outwardly, prompted outside of the leader and from the four path into the turn, chased while failing to keep pace in the three path
around the bend, then faltered five wide and between horses leaving the quarter pole. CRUSADER EXPRESS raced forwardly in the three path early on,
but suffered an injury passing the nine-sixteenths pole and was subsequently pulled up and vanned off.

Footnotes
TWOKO BAY pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, sparred with his inner counterpart through the lane and edged ahead in the final sixteenth.
PALACE KITTEN set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer bidder around the far turn, dueled gamely with that one through the lane but was bested
late. OPTIMUS KAT tracked two wide, then along the inside around the far turn, cut the corner before edging show in midstretch, tipped out and ran on to
slowly gain on the top pair late. GREY STREAK stalked along the inside, pursued in hand from the pocket just off the fence around the far turn, but only
managed to chase between foes in upper stretch, got outkicked by an inner rival for show in midstretch and lacked a bid. SILENT POWER raced at the rear
two wide, attempted to inch closer four wide turning for home, but failed to menace. TELEPHONE TALKER laid off of the pace three wide, took closer order
before stalking within striking range around the far turn, but only managed to chase among foes in upper stretch before yielding. HALEYS SAILOR lacked
speed along the inside, trailed around the far turn, swung out six wide in midstretch and made little impact.

HIGH ENOUGH laid off of the pace in the four to three path early on, launched a four wide rally into the far turn, bid outside of the leader entering the lane,
then drew off under a drive before being put to hand in the final sixteenth. SUMMER IN AIKEN vied two wide, led around the far turn, braced for an outer
challenge entering the lane in the three path, but was bested in upper stretch and remained well clear of show. PERFORMANCE PLUS settled off of the
pace in the two path, swung to the four path turning for home, then ran on willingly to reach show at the wire. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND stalked in the three
path, got outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, chased thereafter but lost show at the wire. TAYSOM stalked along the inside while a path off the
inner railing, awaited racing room around the far turn but lacked a bid once clear. FREE DROP ROB vied along the inside, pressed while headed around the
far turn but weakened entering the lane. BEER WITH ICE was bumped by an inner rival and steadied between horses at the start, got keen soon after,
trailed along the inside while hard to handle around the first turn and was outrun thereafter. STRONG DIAMOND bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off
of the pace in the four path but was through turning for home.

BROWN LIQUOR MAN stalked along the inside, loomed with run just behind the leaders around the far turn, altered course outside of the top pair at the
three sixteenths pole, bid at the furlong grounds and drove past. RINGSIDE was fractious loading, vied along the inside, dueled with an outer pair into the
final furlong, gamely fought on into deep stretch but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. MO SATURDAYS prompted three wide, tugged to the lead tucking
two wide entering the backstretch, vied with an inner foe around the far turn, dueled with that one while hanging on his left lead, then yielded between
horses with a sixteenth to go. GOD OF WINE prompted between the top pair before backing off to stalk entering the backstretch, chased from the two to
three path around the far turn then gradually gave way. REGIMENTAL took contact from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path,
shifted to the four path in upper stretch and pursued one paced. CESNOLA was bothered and crowded between horses at the start, then saved ground well
back, but to no aavil. SOLOMON VANDY trailed along the inside, then three to five wide around the far turn and made little impact. TALK OF THE TOWN
was bumped between horses at the start, lacked speed two wide and failed to factor. GEMSTONE WARRIOR veered inwardly at the start, tracked in the

THINKABOUTIT raced forwardly two wide and between horses, stalked from the two path into the turn, split the leaders in upper stretch to gain an
advantage at the three sixteenths pole, shfited out to brace for VERB's challenge at the furlong grounds, and repelled that one while hanging on his left lead.
VERB was bumped by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the two path, swung out to the six path turning for home, rallied to bid outside of the new leader in
midstretch, but was turned away then lasted for place. ALL WEST lacked speed in the two path, advanced shifting to the four path leaving the quarter pole,
tipped outside of foes and to the six path in midstretch, then sustained progress but missed reaching place. LUNAR MODULE laid off of the pace along the
inside, but was blocked while searching for racing room in the two path in upper stretch, then chased wilingly. PRISONER raced off of the pace in the six to
five path into the turn, brushed with an inner rival while getting outmoved by foes on either side entering the lane, then kept on mildly. HIGH CRUISE vied in
the four path early on, dueled with an inner rival tucking to the three path into the turn, led narrowly turning for home before shifting back to the four path
entering the lane, but was headed by an inner bidder at the three sixteenths pole and weakened between horses in midstretch. TIGER DAD tracked in the
three path and between horses, brushed with an outer rival floating to the four path entering the lane and gave way. GOLD CRUSHER bumped an inner
rival at the start, dueled for the lead along the inside but weakened in upper stretch. TOPPER T stalked from the five to four path into the turn, then faltered
between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
BAG LADY stalked along the inside, brushed her way off the fence in upper stretch, bid along with an outer rival entering the final sixteenth and edged
ahead. SRI LANKA tracked tugging in the bit and shifting from the three path to the four path around the first turn, settled into stalking stride before bidding
outside of the top pair and from the four path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the early pace-setter in upper stretch, kept on well to offer a rebid
entering the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an inner bidder in the process. CLASSIC CLAIRE took contact from an inner rival at the start, showed the
way along the inside, clung to an advantage from a pair of outer bidders turning for home, shook free of them leaving the quarter pole, held sway through
midstretch, but was caught by a pair entering the final sixteenth and lasted for show. LIFFEY saved ground off of the pace, then sustained a grinding charge
along the rail to miss reaching show. NOBLE BERNADETTE bumped an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear two to three wide, shifted to the five path
entering upper stretch and moved up. PLAYMATE laid off of the pace in the three to four path and failed to menace. DEFAULT stalked outside of the leader
and from the three path, bid along with an outer rival turning for home, but failed to keep pace entering the lane and faded between horses. VIOLET FLAME
pursued from midpack in the two path, chased between horses around the far turn, but was done entering the lane and eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
TIPSY TAMMY dueled for the lead three to two wide into the turn, led well in hand entering the lane, drove clear once set down at the three sixteenths pole
and held sway while hanging on her left lead. UPON A STAR broke a step slow at the start, stalked the embattled leading duelers from the four to three path
into the turn, took aim entering the lane and chased the clear leader well through the lane while drawing away from the rest. BUBBLING UP sparred inside
of the leading pair early on, but failed to sustain vying position into the turn, chased the embattled leaders around the bend, then kept on to gain show
between horses at the furlong grounds. GOLDEN DEGREE laid off of the pace in the four path, attempted a bid for show in midstretch but got outkicked.
JUSTIFY PERFECTION lagged behind around the turn then moved up in the closing stages. LAUGHING OUT LOUD lacked speed in the two path despite
being hustled out of the gates, then made little impact. MUGEN dueled for the lead two wide and between horses early on, then along the inside around the
turn, but proved no match for his outer counterpart entering the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
PINK POLKADOTS sped clear early on, received a breather while rating into the far turn, then responded readily once set down in upper stretch to open up
once again, and was driven home to seal the deal. WAY TO BE MARIE brushed the inner half of the starting gate before grazing an inner rival at the off,
pursued from midpack a bit keen between horses into the first turn, settled two wide, tucked to the inside tracking into the far turn, split foes two wide at the
three sixteenths pole to gain place entering midstretch, then surged ahead to be second best. REAGAN'S FLAME stalked along the inside while just a bit off
the inner railing, inched closer to the clear leader along with an outer rival around the far turn, vied for place through upper stretch, got outkicked for that
position in midstretch and held show. LADY HELENA bumped the outer part of the gate upon leaving it, laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide
around the far turn before fanning to the five to six path into upper stretch, ran on to bid for show at the furlong grounds but was kept at bay through the late
stages. DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT pursued from midpack along the inside, then further off into the far turn, shifted to the four path entering the lane, but
steadied hard when put to tight and crowded quarters among foes nearing the furlong grounds, recovered and moved up. LIVI ME DREAMING lacked
speed two wide, progressed around the far turn, shifted to the four to five path entering the lane, but was outkicked between horses in midstretch and kept
on while hanging on her left lead. MARSHAMARSHAMARSHA tracked three to two wide, inched closer around the far turn, vied for place through upper
stretch but weakened between horses at the furlong grounds. BROUGHTY FERRY trailed throughout and never got involved.

Footnotes
SKINNY BOBBY tracked along the inside, glided up to the leaders to offer a three wide bid approaching the far turn, assumed command with five sixteenths
to go and drew off under a drive. CANAL ST. CUPID lacked speed along the inside, then stayed on between horses to gain place in the final furlong.
YOCKEY DOODLEDANDY pursued from midpack in the four to three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane and moved up. BOLIE was tough to
load, stalked in the three to four path, chased around the far turn and gave way. BREAKING STAR lacked speed in the two to four path early on and made
little impact. A G'S GEM vied along the inside, proved no match for an outer bidder into the far turn, weakened and faltered late. INVOLVEDNTERACTION
lacked speed two wide and was outrun. JACK THE WHISTLE vied two wide, but weakened between horses into the far turn and stopped.
