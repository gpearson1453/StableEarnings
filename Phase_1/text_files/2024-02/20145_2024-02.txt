Footnotes
AMERICAN OUTLAW tracked the early pace, ranged up five wide through the turn, took control at the eighth pole and edged clear. FAST TRAFFIC was
unhurried early, raced six wide, was closing late and finished second best. BRAND LOYALTY was allowed to settle early from the inside, made a bid in mid
stretch and weakened. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT was outrun early, raced three wide and offered no late rally. KAE GAE set a pressured early pace from off
the rail and faded. RANGER REX pressed the early pace, raced four wide and gave way. MALMO was reserved early, raced seven wide and was no threat.
OTTOMAN EMPIRE was void of any early speed, raced five wide and never fired.
