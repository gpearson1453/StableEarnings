SPICY TUNA inside speed to duel, stayed game to the wire while well handled to last. SANDRINHA LOVE close up early, troubled into turn, ran along on
wrong lead run in the stretch in a gutsy effort to the wire. NO BODY LOVES ME raced between horses to the turn, angled three wide into stretch with a good
effort. CONTINUE unhurried to the turn, ran along in the stretch for the minor share. BELLA SKYE was slow into stride from gate, raced back to turn and
only improved in the late going. CRAZY STACKS bumped start, rushed to duel to the half, gave in readily late. VIVIS IN FRONT tried to keep up to the turn,
gave way in the stretch run. MARVELING bore in at the start bumped rival while never prominent throughout. LANDY was through early and way readily
from the turn.

Footnotes
MY ROAD off rail run to the turn, came widest with a steady run in the stretch, rallied up at wire in a gallant effort for the win. REAL NAUGHTY inside run to
the front well handled led to the last jump and nailed on the wire. PAPA D L inside chase throughout, kept on for the show spot. TROY BOY sharp break
outside, could not keep up and leveled off stretch. MORE LIES bumped start with an outside run to turn with no late gain. TORMENTA JERRY good position
to the turn with no response in the stretch run. ROYAL DECADENCE inside run to the turn while never a real threat. ARCH EGO three path chase to turn,
emptied out and dropped back readily. WILDERZAR bore out bumped rival from the gate, never menaced thereafter. LATIN BLOOD slow into stride and
lost ground at every call throughout.
