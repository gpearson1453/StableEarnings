Footnotes
EMMY'S HONOR tracked in the three path and between horses approaching the turn, rallied in upper stretch to bid at the furlong grounds and drove clear.
KATIES FACTOR pursued from midpack along the inside, chased in upper stretch, altered course to the four path inside the final furlong, then stayed on
between horses and edged place late. COUNTRY BELLE trailed in the four path around the turn, then stayed on inside of rivals through the final furlong,
shifted out to belatedly split foes three wide in the final sixteenth and gained show. LATE NITE LIZZIE broke slowly, laid off of the pace two wide, swung to
the six path entering upper stretch and moved up. WARM FUZZIES pressed two wide, chased the clear leader around the turn, got outkicked by an outer
bidder nearing midstretch, kept on to vie for place into the final sixteenth but yielded to outer rivals late. MISS NIMBUS set the pace, built a clear margin in
the two path entering the turn, but was caught by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds and weakened. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS tracked in the four path
and gave way.

Footnotes
JERRY'S EIGHTY dueled for the lead two wide, drove clear in upper stretch and held sway. THINKABOUTIT took contact from an inner rival at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three to four path, chased aiming between horses in the final furlong, flopped back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole then gained
place from an outer foe in the late stages. PREMIUM bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked the embattled leading pair from the three path around
the turn, but drifted to the five path in upper stretch, only managed to chase thereafter and yielded place to an inner foe late. TWIRLING ROSES laid off of
the pace in the two path, then chased evenly through the final furlong. FORTUITY leaned into an outer rival at the start, trailed in the two path, drifted to the
seven path in upper stretch and failed to factor. NATIVE THUNDER broke a bit outwardly whlie off a step slow, tugged under restraint while failing to
progress inside of rivals approaching the turn, laid well back along the inside into the bend, spun to the three path entering the lane and made little impact.
CUSTOM BOBBY'S dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but weakened at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
COACH KENNY laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, came under coaxing into the turn but yielded position soon after, swung out to the seven
path regaining stride in upper stretch, rallied widest to bid at the sixteenth pole, led shortly after and held from an inner rival. SCHNELL trailed along the
inside, gained before tipping to the five path and between horses in midstretch, sustained a rally to bid along with an outer rival at the sixteenth pole, kept on
with that one through the late stages but was denied reaching even terms. RELENTLESS DANCER pursued from midpack along the inside, split foes two
wide while getting outkicked by an outer pair at the sixteenth pole and edged show. CHARLI MICHAEL set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer
bidder turning for home, re-forged an advantage in upper stretch, repelled his challenger entering the final furlong, but faltered while getting surpassed by
outer bidders with a sixteenth to go. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK pressed two wide, got outmoved by an outer bidder at the five sixteenths pole, switched out
to the four path entering the lane and only managed to chase while lacking a bid. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER was put to tight quarters among foes at the
start, rushed forward in the opening furlong to stalk three wide, bid outside of the top pair at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but was turned
away nearing midstretch and weakened through the final furlong. RUNNINGINTHEMONEY pursued from midpack three wide, shifted to the five path into
upper stretch but yielded while hanging on his left lead. OUR FREDDIE MAC lacked speed in the four to six path and tired.

Footnotes
SOUTH SIDE prompted between the top pair before backing off to stalk along the inside around the first turn, pursued before looming a danger behind the
top pair entering the lane, tipped outside of them passing the quarter pole, ranged up to bid nearing midstretch, sparred into the final furlong and drove clear
late. DUSTIN THE DIAMOND laid off of the pace in the four path, launched an early gain three wide with a half mile to go, bid outside of the leader turning
for home, led briefly in upper stretch before meeting a stern outer challenge nearing the furlong grounds, dueled with that one into deep stretch but was
bested in the late stages. BOLIVER steadied back from between the leaders entering the first turn, pursued them from midpack in the three to two path,
shifted out to the four path turning for home and moved up mildly. PEARSE showed the way along the inside, vied with an outer bidder turning for home, got
headed by that one in upper stretch and weakened nearing the furlong grounds. ROCKALL was tough to load, then broke a bit outwardly, prompted three to
two wide, but failed to sustain pressure before chasing two wide and between horses around the far turn, and faded. DATS TRUE LOVE was reluctant to
load, then broke a step slow, raced towards the rear in the three to four path and failed to factor. FOE saved ground well back and made little impact.

Footnotes
KINGSCOTE was forced outwardly by an inner rival at the start, steadied when bumped and pinched between rivals shortly after, tracked from the rear of
the short field along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch, gained an advantage nearing midstretch, then
drifted out in the final furlong and held sway. DROBNY showed the way in the three to two path entering the backstretch, vied with an outer bidder while
saving ground around the far turn, repelled that foe while shifting off the inside in upper stretch, but allowed for the eventual winner to offer a rail bid in the
process, got headed by that one nearing the furlong grounds, kept on while being herded outwardly in the final furlong but failed to regain even terms.
MAGICAL MOJO broke outwardly then was bumped by an inner rival soon after the start, pursued form the four to three path, floated to the five path
entering the lane and chased thereafter. MAX IS G MONEY broke outwardly and bumped a rival soon after the start, stalked outside of the leader and from
the three path, vied in the two path around the far turn, but faded after drifting to the four path and between horses entering upper stretch.

Footnotes
VELOCITOR tracked in the four to three path, sustained a determined charge while slowing closing in on the clear leader in the final furlong, bid as an outer
rival ranged up in the closing stages and prevailed at the wire. BEHEMAH STAR stalked outside of the leader, vied with that one around the far turn, drew
clear entering the lane, maintained a margin through midstretch, but tired in the final sixteenth and was caught at the wire. BO CRUZ was brushed by rivals
on either side at the start, tracked along the inside, awaited racing room before moving between horses turning for home, chased among foes in upper
stretch before tipping out three wide for clear sailing at the furlong grounds, offered a steady grind to attempt a late bid, but needed more. BANISHING
brushed an outer rival leaving the starting gate, then was taken in hand between horses entering the first turn, got keyed up before steadying while rank to
shift out to the five path at the seven furlong pole in order to avoid kick-back, tracked the main group from the four path around the far turn, drifted to the five
to six path while chasing in upper stretch, flopped back to his left lead leaving the furlong grounds and ran on willingly thereafter. ARDANWOOD leaned
inwardly at the start, set the pace a bit off of the inside early on, saved ground vying with an outer bidder into the far turn, but was headed leaving the three
furlong pole and yielded entering the lane. MASTER GAME laid well back in the three to two path and failed to menace. WHO TOOK THE MONEY lagged
behind the rest in the two to four path before fanning to the six path into upper stretch, and made little impact. MISSED THE BOAT brushed an inner rival at
the start, laid off of the pace while tucking from the three path around the first turn, then saved ground thereafter but to no avail.

Footnotes
CHAD'S FLASH was bumped by an outer rival at the start, prompted two wide, led around the far turn and drew off. PUTTHEHAMMERDOWN trailed along
the inside, advanced swinging five, then seven, wide entering the lane, and rallied for place. CAJUN CONNECTION laid off of the pace along the inside,
advanced turning for home, shifted to the four path entering the lane before gaining place in upper stretch, but was caught late. SCORING DRIVE lacked
speed in the two path, circled rivals gaining in the five path around the far turn but flattened out in upper stretch. GYPSY'S SOULMATE was fractious
stepping onto the track, tracked in the four path, chased closest to the top pair and from the three path around the far turn but weakened between horses
entering the lane. BATES COURT set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure, vied with that one before being headed at the five sixteenths pole, and
weakened. MAIN DUDE broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start, tracked in the three to two path but faded between horses around the far turn.
BUCK DOLL TAYLOR broke a step slow, raced off of the pace in the five to four path then weakened between horses around the far turn.
