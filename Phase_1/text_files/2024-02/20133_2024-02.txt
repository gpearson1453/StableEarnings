Footnotes
BLUE DREAM MACHINE was urged along on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then made a bid, took a
short lead inside the three-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and prevailed under strong urging. SHIRL'S DELIGHT broke a step
slow, moved up under urging then paused when crowded near the five-eighths pole, saved ground while drafting behind horses on the turn, was asked at
the quarter-pole, found room along the rail and made a bid in upper stretch, battled inside of the winner in the final furlong and missed while well clear for
the place. QUIESCENT leaned in at the start but came out in front, showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged late on the backstretch, vied
inside while asked on the turn, came off the rail into upper stretch then lost the advantage and weakened while clear for the show. LA GIRVINA tracked the
pace, made a bid with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path on the turn, was driven three wide into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and came
up empty. SPLIT SCREEN raced just off the early pace, moved in near the five-eighths pole, climbed some while dropping back under urging near the
nine-sixteenths, fell further off the pace in the two path on the turn and failed to respond. LIL JERSEY GIRL dropped back quickly, raced at the rear, went
four wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
STOLEN BASE was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn, shifted five wide outside the quarter-pole, rallied outside in upper
stretch, closed well to get the lead near the sixteenth-pole then moved clear under steady urging. EMERALD FOREST pressed the pace, vied in the four
then three path on the turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, gained a short lead before the furlong marker, lost the advantage to the winner near the
sixteenth-pole and proved no match while just able to get the place. MIDLANER went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two
path under urging on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive outside the furlong marker and also proved no match for the winner then just missed the
place. WAKE SURF tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the five then four path on the turn, pursued the leaders while remaining on his inside lead
until just before the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that point and lacked the needed kick. HARVARD was coaxed along off the pace, went
four wide on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. POWER SEEKER showed speed between horses then pressed the
pace, dropped back at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased while moving from the three path to the rail on the turn and came up empty. SURPRISE BOSS
broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and was no factor.

when set down in upper stretch and drew away under steady urging. OLYMPIC DREAMS was hustled to the front, showed the way off the rail while inside
of a rival, vied in the two path under urging on the turn, lost the lead at the three-eighths pole, dropped back in upper stretch and proved no match while able
to get the place. GUNTOWN broke out at the start, settled off the pace, dropped back with six furlongs to run, angled in late on the backstretch, was urged
along in the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. DANCE CODE was taken in hand early then settled at the rear,
passed the five-eighths pole under urging, saved ground early on the turn, shifted four wide late on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and was no
factor. SYNTHESIS stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up between horses then prompted the pace on the
outside, vied in the three path while asked on the turn, dropped back with three furlongs to run, spun four wide into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LI'L LANG raced three wide in aim of the leader before advancing tucked to the two path into the turn, took over command nearing the three-eighths, came
under light coaxing and took the inside route into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to prevail. PROFITABILITY raced three wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while along well clear of the rest to be second
best. FRANKIE R. bobbled at the break recovering to get away last, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper
stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. DRINKING SOLO coaxed from the gate, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
went nine wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. GO GRAD chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired. SWEPT broke out at the start trading a bump with THE SAXON STORY, who came
inwards, chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired.
JEFFERSONS OCEAN vied briefly very early before emerging from the pack with sole command, showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside
into the turn coming under threat to the outside and was placed to coaxing near the three-eighths, got headed for the front near that station, faded and
angled out five wide at the quarter pole and faltered in the stretch. THE SAXON STORY bobbled at the break and recovered inwards to trade a bump with
SWEPT, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths while detached at the tail of the field, went four wide into upper stretch and
was eased home to the finish.
