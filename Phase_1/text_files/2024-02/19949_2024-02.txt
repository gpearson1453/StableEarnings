Footnotes
BRONZE GIRL was away in good order, took back off of the contentious early pace and tracked from the inside, tipped three to four wide for the drive and
gained ground nearing the furlong marker, loomed past mid-stretch and took command nearing the sixteenth-pole, kicked clear into deep stretch and drew
away to prevail in the late stages. SILVER MATY showed good early speed and vied for the lead away from the start, was engaged by CAPO SORELLA
heading into the turn and contested the decent pace with that rival to the quarter marker, battled with CAPO SORELLA into the stretch, was overtaken by
BRONZE GIRL nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and held safely in the end for the place. CAPO
SORELLA was hustled leaving the break and contested the decent early pace, battled with SILVER MATY into the turn and disputed the pace to the quarter
marker, took a short lead nearing the top of the lane and battled with SILVER MATY into the stretch, weakened into the final sixteenth and held for third at
the finish. HARBOR LASS tracked the decent early pace, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker, gained ground into the stretch, needed more
into the final sixteenth, was outkicked and just missed for show honors. PARTYATTHEMOONTOWR chased outside of rivals in the early going, went four to
five wide approaching the quarter marker, maintained an outside path into the stretch and lacked a late response. RICKELLE was crowded leaving the start
and was away a bit slowly, chased three wide into the turn, made a mild gain at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and
flattened out. MISS PERU lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not factor.

Footnotes
ZOE'S PRIDE was asked to rate leaving the start and took back off of the contentious early pace, shifted to the inside at the half-mile marker and saved
ground into the turn, improved position nearing the quarter marker and tipped two wide for the drive, confronted CAT BANDIT into upper stretch and battled
with that rival to the furlong marker, dueled while on even terms into the final sixteenth, wore down the game runner-up in deep stretch and edged away in
the final strides. CAT BANDIT was hustled away from the start and assumed command of the early running, set a decent pace while pressured into the turn,
carved out solid fractions while pressured to the quarter marker, was confronted into upper stretch by ZOE'S PRIDE and battled with that rival to the furlong
pole, dueled gamely while on even terms into the final sixteenth, was repelled by ZOE'S PRIDE into deep stretch and held safely in the end for place
honors. ALL HALLOWS tracked the solid early pace from the outside, raced four wide into the turn then was carried to the six path nearing the quarter
marker, recovered into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, could not impact the top pair in the final sixteenth but closed into deep stretch and was
clear in the end for show honors. SHEZA QUEEN BEE rated off of the solid early pace, was guided three wide along the turn and trailed to the quarter
marker, offered a mild late rally but was unable to threaten in the final stages. WEGOTTODRINKING showed speed and pressured the solid early pace
outside of CAT BANDIT, kept close attendance into the turn then drifted four wide midway through the bend, bothered a pair of rivals and corrected into
upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and gave way in the final sixteenth. STANDFORGRIT forwardly placed in the early running, pressed
three wide and between rivals into the turn, was carried to the five path midway through the bend and steadied while in tight quarters approaching the
quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and could not muster a late response.

Footnotes
CROWN OF HOPE was forwardly placed away from the start, rated off of the leading pair and tracked the fast pace into the turn, was well placed into the
turn and raced two to three wide to the quarter marker, was roused three to four wide for the drive and loomed at mid-stretch, battled with SHADOWED
THOUGHTS into the final sixteenth, shook free of the runner-up in deep stretch and drove clear for a convincing win. SHADOWED THOUGHTS was
hustled away from the start and vied for the early lead, ceded to STEPHANIE'S CANDY and pressed that runner through quick fractions heading into the
turn, kept pressure on STEPHANIE'S CANDY to the quarter marker then battled into upper stretch, vied between rivals at the quarter marker and met the
bid of CROWN OF HOPE into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner in deep stretch and was second best. STEPHANIE'S CANDY was
asked for speed leaving the start and assumed command of the early running, set a fast pace while pressured into the turn, carved out solid fractions while
pressed to the quarter marker, dug in into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker, was overtaken and weakened into the final sixteenth, could not
keep pace with the top pair into deep stretch and held clearly for third. BELLA ROSINA settled off of the fast early pace and tracked from the outside to
begin, was guided to the two path into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, was gaining into the final sixteenth but could not catch the leaders in deep
stretch. NO BEACHES was squeezed leaving the start and was away slowly, saved ground along the turn, made a mild rally into the stretch but did not
threaten in the final stages. PEGGY THE COLONEL took back off of the fast early pace and tracked from the second flight, was guided four wide to the
quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and did not have an impact.

Footnotes
WORKDAY was hustled for the lead and was left unchallenged, went clear by a couple of lengths, rated well and dictated a very slow pace, held sway to the
far turn, hand plenty left when set down in the stretch and won easily under a brisk hand ride. BALLROOM PRINCE tracked WORKDAY from the rail under
a little bit of restraint to the far turn, was asked to go on after passing the three-eighths marker and finished well but could not make up the needed ground
on the winner while getting up in time to grab the second placing. LOVE OF THE SPORT tracked two wide outside of BALLROOM PRICE moved in tandem
with that rival from the seven-eighths pole to the far turn, started the bid from the five-sixteenths, could not threaten the winner but battled BALLROOM
PRICE to the wire and came out on the short end of the photo. GORM settled well behind the pace, launched a bid from the 5/16 could not make up any
ground on the trio in front but finished evenly under steady handling. WINTER SOLDIER hopped slightly at the start then lacked any speed and lagged
behind in the early going, attempted to rally on the far turn but never got untracked, swung five to six wide into the stretch and finished in the middle of the
track unable to improve position.

Footnotes
PRINCESA DEL TIGRE forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the pace two wide along the first turn, advanced to prompt the moderate pace through
the backstretch run, pressed PROOF OF JAZZ into the second turn, took command into the stretch and kicked clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task
into the final sixteenth and drew away in the late stages to prevail. BOLD DAUGHTER was unhurried leaving the start and settled into the first turn,
maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace two wide to the half-mile pole, gained ground two to three wide into the
second turn, swung four wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished the
rest to earn place honors. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY prominent away from the start, took back off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn,
tracked the modest pace through the backstretch run and saved ground into the far turn, angled three wide into the stretch and lost a bit of ground at the
furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch and was outfinished for second, while just holding for
third at the wire. TIZ MY PRINCESS was allowed to settle leaving the start and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the modest pace through the
backstretch run and saved all of the ground into the second turn, improved position at the quarter marker and chased into the stretch, was outkicked at the
furlong grounds and ran in pursuit into the final sixteenth, needed more in deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. PROOF OF JAZZ broke
alertly and assumed command away from the start, drew to a clear lead along the first turn and showed the way into the backstretch run, set modest
fractions while prompted to the half-mile marker, was pressured into the second turn by PRINCESA DEL TIGRE and held a narrow lead at the quarter
marker, was overtaken into the stretch and chased to the furlong grounds, could not muster a late response and gave way in the final sixteenth. MASTERY
KAT was crowded by neighboring rivals at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, raced three wide into
the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace from the outside approaching the half-mile marker, was well placed into the second turn and chased two to
three wide at the quarter pole, lost ground nearing the top of the stretch then checked in tight quarters past the three-sixteenths pole, was outrun to
mid-stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
SOO BROOKLYN was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the fast early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and advanced
approaching the quarter marker, tipped two wide nearing the top of the lane and confronted NICE ENCOUNTER into the stretch, battled with that rival while
drifting out approaching the furlong pole, took command and kicked clear heading to the sixteenth-marker, was kept to task into deep stretch and drew away
in the final stages. WIRLY GIRLY broke alertly, rated off of the fast early pace and tracked from the outside to begin, was roused four wide at the quarter
marker, rallied into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, was outkicked by the winner into deep stretch and held clearly for second at the
finish. NICE ENCOUNTER showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, dictated terms while clear into the turn, carved out a fast
pace while clear to the quarter marker, came under pressure in upper stretch and met the bid of SOO BROOKLYN to the furlong grounds, could not keep
pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and faded in deep stretch, while clear of the rest for show honors. VIOLET THUNDER allowed to settle away
from the start, went two wide into the turn and lost ground at the quarter marker, maintained a two wide path into the stretch, offered a mild late rally but was
not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch. LADY OF THE RIVER was forwardly placed leaving the start, chased the fast pace three wide into the turn,
lost position into the stretch and did not offer a late rally. FLY SOUTH broke in air and was away slowly, chased from the inside heading into the turn, saved
ground into the stretch and gained at the furlong pole, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and did not threaten. PARTY TIME GAL broke
slowly, was a bit green in the early running, trailed into the turn and did not have an impact.

stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, responded to urging into the final sixteenth, wore down TOP EXECUTIVE in the final strides and was up in time
for a determined win. TOP EXECUTIVE was prominent away from the start, rated off of the fast early pace and tracked into the turn, saved ground to the
quarter marker and loomed into upper stretch, took command approaching the furlong marker and led into the final sixteenth, raced on even terms with
LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM into deep stretch, was tagged for the win in the final strides and held for second at the finish. ARMA D'ORO was slow away from
the start and was allowed to settle in the early stages, trailed into the turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, tipped three wide into upper stretch and
rallied at the furlong pole, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and just missed for the place, while getting up in time to secure show honors. DOO WOP
DON bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled off of the fast early pace and tracked into the turn, raced three to four wide to the quarter
marker, swung five wide for the drive and rallied at the furlong marker, found his best stride late and just missed for show honors. ALEXANDER'S DREAM
took back to track the fast early pace, tracked three to four wide into the turn and maintained his position at the quarter marker, rallied three to four wide into
the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch. HAY JUAN broke alertly and sped
to the early lead, set fast fractions into the turn and drew to a clear lead while off of the rail at the quarter pole, came under pressure into the stretch, was
overtaken approaching the furlong marker and faded in the late stages. MOHAWK KING (IRE) was forwardly placed in the early running, saved ground into
the turn and chased to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and could not muster a late rally.

YO BABY broke inward at the break and immediately engaged with BEAT OF MY HEART to vie for the early lead, maintained a very slight advantage
through the turn with that foe pressing the issue to the outside, drifted out turning for home causing the rival to alter course, came into the stretch facing a
stiff headwind then gook on a challenge from SIMPLY GRACIOUS to the outside and CLUBHOUSE DRAMA to the inside, got the better of the latter two
foes passing the furlong marker then found a resurgent BEAT OF MY HEART challenging to the inside yards from the finish but kept on relentlessly and got
a favorable bob of the head at the line to prevail in a super gutsy effort. BEAT OF MY HEART broke best and took the lead out of the gate, was quickly
joined by YO BABY before passing the first pole, dueled with that foe in the two path through the turn then was between horses when joined by SIMPLY
GRACIOUS to the outside, backed out of a tight spot passing the quarter pole, then got stuck behind horses trying to re-rally in the stretch, found some
room just before the sixteenth pole, surged late, got a nose in front but lost the bob at the wire. MARS MAGIC broke inward after the break and bothered
GOT THE BUG but was up on the pace with the early leaders, backed off a bit passing the half-mile pole, tracked from a few lengths back through the turn
in the three path then dropped down the rail for the stretch run, and finished well under urging to get up for third in a solid debut. SIMPLY GRACIOUS broke
well and settled four wide just off the pace setters to the turn, ranged up to bid for the lead three wide near the quarter pole, set down and dueled with YO
BABY to mid-stretch, could not get past that foe and weakened in the last furlong. CLUBHOUSE DRAMA took a light bump from YO BABY after the break
but was always close to the pace, tracked the dueling leaders while saving all the ground, slipped through along the rail to bid for the lead turning for home,
battled with YO BABY to mid-stretch but weakened in the final furlong. HOT BETTY was slow to begin and spotted the field several lengths head start,
rushed up and managed to rejoin the field near the seven-sixteenths pole, was kept in a drive through the turn and into the stretch and was slowly making
forward progress in the end despite racing a little greenly. GOT THE BUG got sandwiched at the start and took up sharply, dropped way behind and was
forced to chase the field, was not put under pressure late when hopelessly beaten but managed to pass one before the wire. CLARE'S BABY broke out after
the break and bothered GOT THE BUG, was at the rear of the leading group but had to be ridden to keep up the pace, began to lose ground passing the
three furlong pole and had nothing to offer in the stretch.
