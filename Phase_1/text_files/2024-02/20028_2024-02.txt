COMPLETED STORM stalked outside, bid outside rivals on the turn, led into the stretch, drew clear and then held well under urging. CATTY'S UNCLE
raced two wide off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied on the rail, dug in gamely in the lane but second best. AYE raced off the pace inside,
steadied in tight entering the turn, came wide, closed belatedly outside and got up for third. SHADOW BOX set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled
past the quarter pole, weakened and lost third late. GAMERUN was outrun early and did not factor. NICKEL NICKEL stalked the pace, chased on the turn,
went three wide at the quarter pole and tired. FULL CONTACT stalked, chased on the turn, between rivals at the quarter pole and faded. A Jockey
Objection by the rider of AYE against CATTY'S UNCLE was dismissed.

INSPECTOR stalked the loose pacesetter, bid on the final turn, drifted in nearing the sixteenth pole, was straightened and remained clear. DOUBLE O
OTTO sprinted away inside, was collared on the final turn, steadied off winner near the sixteenth pole, altered course and continued well.
TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT raced close up outside initial half mile, faded then came again for the show. KANE settled in two path off the pace, continued
willingly in the late stages. EXCLUSIVE ORDER saved ground, was put to urging on the final turn then faltered. MCMAGIC chased wide and trailed
throughout. Following a stewards inquiry and an objection by the second finisher against the winner for interference in the stretch, the result was allowed to
stand.

ARLYNE'S CROWN set a pressured pace in the two path, shook loose in midstretch and just lasted under steady urging. FANCY WARRIOR saved ground
throughout, bid in the stretch and just missed. AUNT BERRA prompted the pace three wide, faded briefly then came again in the final furlong. SHE'S A
LINO forced the pace along the rail to the stretch and weakened. SWEEPING PASSION dropped back wide and narrowed the gap without menacing. MAP
OF LIFE broke slowest, angled inside and was never a factor. WHY NOT BABE lacked speed outside and gave way readily. FINE WHINING offered a brief
bid on the turn then stopped abruptly.

JEZEBEL JADE trailed early, advanced extremely wide, offered a late surge and was just up in time. FAIRY DREAMS settled off the pace inside, angled out
in the stretch; led and was nailed. SIZZLING ROMA forced the pace inside, bid to the front in midstretch then weakened. LUNA T lacked speed, rallied
inside then flattened out late. VITAEMI alternated for the advantage for half a mile then proved empty in the final furlong. OLD HEAD saved ground off the
pace, moved out in the stretch with a mild bid. HIGHTIME VALENTINE raced wide in midpack and lacked a solid response. SNAPPY RIDE dropped far
behind outside and was never a factor. GOLDEN LAW was urged wide off the leaders and gave way readily. SEVEN YEARS LATER set a pressured pace
in the two path then gave way in the stretch.

CELTIC TIGER set the pace on the inside, dueled on the turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely inside of AYEARTOREMEMBER in the final furlong
and determinedly held that rival at bay. AYEARTOREMEMBER chased between rivals early on, bid two wide on the turn, dueled with the winner, dug in
gamely outside of that rival in the stretch drive and continued willingly to the finish. TRUE PHENOMENON raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on
the turn and rallied mildly on the rail. THEARCHERORTHEPREY chased three wide, continued three wide on the turn and finished evenly. DIVINE
ROMANCE chased five wide early, then moved near the inside on the turn and had no rally. SANDY Q tracked on the inside, chased inside on the turn and
weakened. CLASSY NANCY chased four wide, four wide on the turn and tired.

LORD MIO set the pace on the inside, showed the way into the far turn, then hooked up with VINE JET, dug in gamely inside of that rival in the stretch run
and battled back determinedly to prevail. VINE JET bumped at the start, was well placed close up on the inside, bid on the far turn, put a head in front,
dueled with LORD MIO passing the furlong marker, dug in gamely outside of that rival and was outfinished late. KODAPENDENT raced off the pace inside,
saved ground on the far turn, rallied inside in the stretch and was well clear for the show spot. COLONEL JUAN raced off the pace inside, chased inside on
the far turn, rallied mildly, then weakened late. THE TWINS SNEAKERS raced two wide off the pace and had no rally. SECRET PATH was off a bit slow
and bumped, trailed the field, came four wide into the lane and passed tired rivals. TRUE DAKOTAN raced three wide off the pace and failed to threaten.
THE ANGRY MAN raced four wide early, settled off the pace and did not factor. WE READY stalked two wide, then chased and gave way. RELISHMENT
