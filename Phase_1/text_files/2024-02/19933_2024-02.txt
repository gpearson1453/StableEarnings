Footnotes
WONDERRAND raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, rallied down the lane and proved the best. LADY CHERYL'S
SONG vied for the early lead, drove clear, led until deep in the stretch, couldn't hold off WONDERRAND for the win. GETOUTOFDAWAY void of early
speed, gained ground, proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. GEAUX MAW P raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and
was caught for third. HALF OFF HALF broke in, quickly went to the front and weakened down the stretch. SECRETLY SWEET raced near the middle of the
field, put forth an even effort and lacked a late bid. F J'S CHAOS bumped at the start, raced in the middle of the pack and was never a factor. LYRICAL
BELLE raced evenly near the back and showed little. UNKNOWN CALLER bothered at the start, raced in the back and was never a threat. FIVE LEAF
CLOVER broke in, pressed the pace, came around the turn wide and dropped back.

MUCHMORETHANREADY unhurried in the beginning, made a steady gain, moved up strong around the final turn, ran away from the field and won handily.
R T'S GEM dueled on the front with PICKIN ANA GRINNIN, was forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second.
PICKIN ANA GRINNIN challenged for the early lead, weakened down the home stretch and proved third best. SHE'S GONE D'WILD void of early speed,
improved position, but was no factor. MEGANS MILLIONS raced within striking distance, faded and was no threat late. GIRL THIRSTY broke poorly, raced
in the back and showed little. EL CALIENTE LADY raced in the middle of the field and dropped back. GEORGIA DAWN raced near the middle of the pack,
retreated to the back and was outrun.

MYFRIENDSAWINNER dueled for the early advantage, drove clear around the turn and was kept to the task. COMMERCIAL FLASH pressed the pace, got
in tight around the turn, eased back, came again on the inside, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. SERAPE showed early speed,
forwardly placed throughout and was outfinished for second. FOR REAL ALICE raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, racing wide, but was no
factor. D'WILD MUFFIN lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no threat. DOLLY'S GUITAR void of early speed, moved up, but was no threat.
LIL ADEAU pressed the early pace, raced outside around the turn and faded. BET ON BOURBON void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was
never close. MISS CHARLIE GRAS lacked early speed and showed little. BIND ON EARTH flashed early speed, dropped back and was outrun. THE
JOCKEY OF #2 COMMERCIAL FLASH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #4 MYFRIENDSAWINNER FOR INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE

HEZA PICKLE broke out, racing in the back, moved up on the inside entering the final turn, steadied, blocked, angled out entering the stretch and drove
clear before the wire. IZZY'S BABY BOY showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout, took the lead at the 3/4 pole, but couldn't hold off the winner
late. MUFFIN NUTS lacked early speed, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two. HOT LE ROY raced near the middle of the pack, saved
ground around the final turn, made a bid, took the lead and weakened. THROWIN' SHADE vied for the early advantage, dropped back and passed tired
ones late. MR. FOUR SEVENS pressed the early pace, faded and was no threat late. DOCTOR LEO raced near the back, coming around the first turn on
the outside, moved up, within contention and retreated. FIELD OF VISION dueled on the front end and retreated to the rear.

Footnotes
SHARP CHARLIE shot to the front, drove clear, saved ground, dueled down the stretch and just held on for the win. DOUBLE BARREL MAN raced within
striking distance, moved up on the outside around the turn, dueled down the lane and missed. GOLDEN PALACE raced in the middle of the field, made a
bid and proved no match for the top two. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS void of early speed, finished wide, while showing late interest, but was no factor.
HOSTILE AFLEET showed early speed and faded. HAIL STATE raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. HALF OURS N STORMY
lacked early speed and was never a threat. ADIEU ACES dueled on the front end in the beginning and dropped back. DRAFT CHOICE void of early speed
and showed little.
