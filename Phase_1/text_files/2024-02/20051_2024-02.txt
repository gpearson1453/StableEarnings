Footnotes
ISLANDINTHESTREAM took command from three wide entering the backstretch, set a well rated pace, repelled the challenge of the runner-up nearing the
quarter pole and drew clear. REMEMBERING prompted the pace to the far turn, ranged up to challenge the winner turning for home, could not go with that
one and kept on willingly to be second best. QUICKSTYLE showed brief speed to lead in the first turn, dropped to the rear of the field down the backside
and was never a threat. TEST YOUR FAITH chased the leaders for a half mile and faded as no factor.

Footnotes
LUCKY COUGAR unhurried early to trail, steadily gained ground on the turn circling four wide, was carried out in upper stretch, altered course to the inside
of the leader and surged in the final yards to gain the tie. DESTINO tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied three wide to take command in upper stretch,
drifted out through the lane and held on at the wire. EL BAMBINO chased the pace through the turn and kept on in the lane evenly to gain the show.
POKER PARTNER stumbled badly leaving the gate, was quickly gathered up, rushed up to prompt the pace, took a clear lead on the bend and flattened out
in the stretch. M EIGHTY was never a threat. SIR MASON showed speed for three-eighths and gave way. THE RIDER OF LUCKY COUGAR CLAIMED
FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN BY DESTINO, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
PEACE OF EKATI pressed the pace down the backside, took control rallying two wide on the final turn and drew off through the lane as much best.
PERFETTO set a well rated pace to the far turn, had no answer when engaged midway on the bend and kept on willingly through the lane to hold the place.
PRIVATE LAKE stalked the pace while well positioned along the fence and failed to gain ground finishing evenly. POLITICAL trailed to the head of the lane
and mounted a mild bid from six wide. ALGORIX tracked the leaders from three wide through the final turn and weakened in the lane. YOUVESAIDITALL
was never a factor.

chased the early pace, dropped to the rear of the field on the backstretch and was never a threat.

stalked the pace through the turn, made a three wide bid to open a clear advantage in mid-stretch and was caught late in the lane. OVERLOAD setlled in
hand to be reserved off the leaders and made a steady, grinding advance through the lane to take the show. WILDCAT BILL well placed to be tracking the
leaders through the turn, made a mild bid in upper stretch and finished evenly. DASH OF FIRE raced in mid-pack and passed weaker rivals in the lane.
IT'SGOODTOBESEEN went evenly. COWTOWN BOSS pressed the pace to the head of the lane and weakened down the lane. BAD BOY BOOGIE set the

CENTSOFWANDER reserved off the pace early, advanced on the turn, angled five wide at the top of the lane and closed well to be going away at the wire.
GOING IN STYLE sped to the lead away from the gates, opened a clear advantage on the turn shaking off the presser and could not last in deep stretch.
DEACON DOUGIE pressed the pace to the turn, dropped away from the pacesetter on the bend and kept on down the lane to hold the show. TOUCH
CODE prominently placed in the early going, droped back losing position on the turn and made a late mild bid up the fence in the stretch. AQUITANIA
ARRIVAL well placed to be in striking distance of the leaders and lacked a closing response. STAR ENTERTAINER was not a factor.

Footnotes
JODHPUR bobbled slightly at the start, raced up four wide to press the pace, dueled down the lane and shook clear late in the drive gamely.
DREAMINGABOUTTIME tracked the leaders into the turn, circled five wide to loom in upper stretch, battled in the lane and was out-finished late. C V
DYNAMIC rated in mid-pack for a half, angled to the inside to commence a rally, brushed the rail in mid-stretch and finished willingly. SWAYBACK MOBIL
reserved to be mid-field to the top of the lane and rallied belatedly. CINSAULT slow early to be the trailer and showed good late interest. WEEKEND
RETREAT unhurried to be well off the pace to the turn and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. GHOST OF LONDYN hustled up from between rivals to duel
on the pace, took a brief lead on the turn and weakened coming home. OLLIE'S FOLLY flashed brief speed to battle on the pace and faded in the turn.
EQUITY CAT pressed the pace from between rivals and gave way.
