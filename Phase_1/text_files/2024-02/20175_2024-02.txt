Footnotes
COMRADERY (IRE) stalked two then three wide on the first turn, chased outside a rival into the far turn, took aim three wide approaching the stretch,
challenged the top pair in upper stretch, took over at the sixteenth pole and held over the late run from the runner up. BROTHER REID settled inside off the
pace then moved into range, chased a bit off the rail into the lane, rallied between rivals and missed. HAPI HAPI broke well then rated behind the leader
from the rail, moved up to apply pressure from outside in the middle stages still in hand, stayed alongside the pacesetter through the far turn, took over in
upper stretch but got outkicked in the final sixteenth. HONOS MAN unhurried in the beginning, trailed on the inside to the stretch, moved out in the lane and
kept on to gain a minor award. TAISHAN became rank on the clubhouse turn chasing two then three wide, took those same paths on the second bend and
finished evenly in the lane. SAI CON (FR) turned his head and hopped slightly to lose a step at the start, rushed up to clear and cut across to the inside,
took pressure from HAPI HAPI on the backstretch, carried a narrow lead into the lane, was overtaken shortly after and weakened in the late stages.

Footnotes
MOTORCADE vied three deep early then dueled outside MOBE TOWN leaving the backstretch, shook free at the five-sixteenths pole and drew away late
on the bend, led clear under in the final furlong, grew a bit weary late but was able to hold. MOBE TOWN vied inside rivals then dueled with MOTORCADE
into the turn, failed to kick on with that rival at the five-sixteenths pole, chased along the rail into the lane, moved out in upper stretch and came back on
gamely late. UNUSUAL WIN pressed between early then chased the top pair approaching the seven-sixteenths pole, rounded the bend in the two path,
drifted out then back in a bit in upper stretch, had the rider lose the whip past the eighth pole and could not summon the needed rally but churned on to hold
third. BARBACOA raced up close then climbed briefly behind the winner approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, chased three then two wide on the bend and
lacked a rally. DONTTESTYOURLUCK forwardly placed then got crowded by BARBACOA moving inward, started to climb and dropped back, navigated the
turn in the four path and failed to menace.

ANMER HALL settled off the pace then drew closer up the backstretch, gained along the fence around the turn, tipped out into the lane, drew alongside the
leader at the eight pole and drove clear under right handed urging. HANDSOME TICKET set the pace inside I'M A LUCKY MAN into and around the turn,
cleared briefly in upper stretch but was soon confronted by ANMER HALL at the eighth pole, could not match strides with the winner in the late stages and
stayed on to secure second. ST IGNACIO broke a bit slow, trailed to the turn, made progress along the fence around the bend, came off the rail a bit into
the lane then angled out with a furlong remaining and finished willingly to gain third. I'M A LUCKY MAN pressed the pace from outside, lost touch with the
leader in upper stretch and weakened deep stretch. AWESOME RHYTHM chased from off the pace then gained up the backstretch, rounded the bend two
wide and came up empty in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RASCALITY took control early and moved inside, showed the way under pressure up the backstretch, maintained command through the bend, shook free at
the top of the lane and drew away. NOT A SINNER (GB) stalked 3deep then outside a rival, rounded the bend two then three wide, could not make
headway on the winner in the final furlong and held on for second. PARADISE LAKE stalked between then got crowded past the half-mile pole to lose
ground, was shuffled back behind a rival around the bend, continued along the inside, lacked room and took up when boxed in along the fence in upper
stretch, angled out into the clear only to bump with a rival, then finished well to almost get by the runner-up for second. NOTIME FOR SQUALLS stumbled
badly shortly after at the start, raced near the back in the early going, saved ground through the turn, moved out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to
round out the superfecta. MS BO J showed early speed wide up the backstretch then pressed the pacesetter from outside, fought two wide through the turn,
failed to kick on with the winner at the top of the lane, drifted in midstretch and weakened. KETONIA (FR) raced in range off the inside, took the turn three
then four wide, drifted in and bumped midstretch, then weakened in the final sixteenth. GREER MY DEAR sat off the pace and moved inside, went outside a
rival on the turn, drifted in to bother rival, checked midstretch and was too late to rally once recovered from the trouble. MATINA broke a step slow, stalked
inside rivals along the rail, climbed briefly at the three-eighths pole while a bit off the rail and lost ground, drew closer again from the fence around the bend,
kept to task on the inside in the lane but could not rally. WESTPHALIA broke a step slow, trailed up the backstretch, raced along the rail to two wide on the
turn and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
LIBERAL LADY sped clear in the two path then moved to the rail around the first turn, controlled the pace up the backstretch, continued to save ground on
the front-end through the second turn, roused entering the lane, asked right handed at the eighth pole and stayed clear to the line. LISA'S NONNO hit the
gate to lose a step at the start, stalked three then two wide early, closest in pursuit from the two path through the far turn, chased after the winner
determinedly in the lane but had to settle for second best. BIG NOVEL broke a bit slow, chased keenly two then three wide on the first turn, ridden along still
in the three path on the second bend and finished willingly through the lane. GILA stalked under a strong hold from inside early, started to lose ground from
the rail then a bit off the fence on the far turn and weakened down the stretch. BELLEO'S FOREST trailed near the rail into the first turn then angled out
while moving to a forward position four wide leaving the bend, dropped back four to five wide on the far turn and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
ANDY CAN U HEAR ME settled outside a rival, had to take a bit of a hold when losing his path approaching the half-mile pole, chased two wide through the
turn, cut into the lead steadily through the lane and got up at the wire. SAWASDEE sped clear and opened up early, continued well clear while saving
ground through the turn, held a diminished lead but still unchallenged with a sixteenth left to run and got caught on the line. LEYAS CANDY was closest in
pursuit in the early stages, saved ground through the turn, came off the rail in the stretch, put in a late bid but lacked the needed final kick. GYPSY TEARS
checked between rivals early then moved inside, steadied briefly near the half-mile pole, chased on the rail then went between rivals on the turn, tipped out
in the stretch and whittle the gap late. GEEZER sat off the pace outside a rival, three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, moved out in upper stretch and
offered a mild response to also close the gap late. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR broke a step slow, settled inside, lost positions on the turn and failed to menace.
RAGING WATERS dropped back early, trailed two wide then moved to the rail on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

TESSUTO broke a step slow, chased three wide then outside a rival on the first turn, asked three then two wide on the second bend, drew alongside LAKE
SUPERIOR at the top of the lane, put a head in front at the eighth pole and drew clear in the final sixteenth. LAKE SUPERIOR dueled outside a rival for
early command, edged clear on the backstretch, led two wide through the far turn, confronted by TESSUTO at the top of the stretch, fought back from inside
to midstretch, then yielded at the sixteenth pole and kept on for a clear second. NORMANDY LANDING stalked a bit off the rail around the clubhouse turn,
chased in the four path leaving the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane and flattened in the late stages. MR FABRICATOR chased briefly then went
up to duel inside LAKE SUPERIOR for the lead, could not keep pace with that rival at the half-mile pole, chased along the rail through the far turn and
weakened in the drive. IGNITE THE LIGHT broke a step slow, chased off the pace three to four wide on the first turn, continued off the inside into the
second bend, got floated out mildly leaving the far turn and failed to menace. BATTLE CRUISER tossed his head and got bothered by inner rival leaving the
gate, trailed on the inside early, went two wide around the far turn then angled out at the quarter pole and could not threaten.

Footnotes
AG BULLET stalked PHENOM outside a rival into the turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, took over in upper stretch, put away PHENOM
midstretch and remained clear under a drive to the wire. GRACELUND GRAY forwardly placed along the inside, waited behind the leader through the turn,
roused at the top of the lane but lacked room behind PHENOM, altered out in upper stretch, finished gamely in the furlong grounds but could not reach the
winner. MISS LIZZY off slow to begin, sat off the pace and steered to the inside, drew closer around the bend, tipped out crossing the dirt, moved out further
in the lane and got up for third. LUNAR IMPACT (GB) chased on the inside then shifted to the two path around the turn, raced within striking distance down
the stretch and got edged for the show honors. ICE DANCING chased three wide off the pace into the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, got
floated out a bit crossing the dirt, put in a late rally but needed to find more. SCHOOL DANCE broke a step slow and dropped back early, went two wide into
the turn, moved out to the three path then shifted back in late on the bend, moved out in the lane and showed a mild rally between horses late. ONE SILK
STOCKING traveled three deep towards the rear, angled out into the lane and never threatened. CARMEN MIRANDA chased between rivals then got put in
tight entering the turn, traveled two wide then tipped out across the dirt and failed to rally. PHENOM showed early speed to take control, showed the way
along the rail on the turn before being confronted by the winner at the quarter pole, dueled inside that rival into the lane, relinquished the lead in upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. VIOLENT RUNNER chased two then three wide on the turn, got floated out a bit across the dirt then cut back
inside entering the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
TAKES THREE came in early to bother rivals early then sped clear and steered to the inside, dueled with TRAVELIN' SHOW up the backstretch, inched
ahead from that rival on the far turn, cleared at the top of the lane, challenged by rivals at the eighth pole, drifted out under left handed urging in the final
furlong and gamely prevailed. CLEMENTS RIDE got knocked off stride early, stalked two then three wide on the clubhouse turn before going up for the lead
three deep into the backstretch, dropped back to a stalking position again in the middle stages, moved over to the rail into the far turn, angled out and spun
three wide into the lane, challenged TAKES THREE at the eighth pole, battled between rivals late and lacked the needed final kick to get by. RUN BRYCE
RUN broke out and bumped rival, settled inside then moved into the two path for the clubhouse turn, bumped with outer rival twice entering the far turn,
moved out but ran into traffic behind CLEMENTS RIDE on the far turn, angled widest at the top of the stretch, closed gamely four deep and edged SPECIAL
CLUB for the show honors. SPECIAL CLUB reared in the starting gate then settled back down, broke a bit slow and lost his path behind rivals crossing over,
steered to the inside and chased well off the pace in the early going, went three deep into the far turn, came four wide into the stretch, rallied to confront the
leader at the eighth pole, fought three deep in the final sixteenth and got outkicked. VOLS hard to load prior to the start, broke in and bumped, stalked from
inside then started to pull on the clubhouse turn, paused when put in a bit tight by outer pair entering the far turn, continued to save ground to the stretch
and weakened down the lane. TRAVELIN' SHOW got forced into inner rival by TAKES THREE early, stalked two wide around the clubhouse turn then went
up to challenge for the lead between rivals, dueled from outside up the backstretch, kept the pressure on TAKES THREE through the far turn, lost touch with
that rival at the top of the stretch and weakened in the furlong grounds. TROTSKY off slow in the beginning, lagged behind on the inside and never got
involved. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED TAKES THREE FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR ANGLING IN SHARPLY EARLY
AND FORCING TRAVELIN' SHOW TO BUMP CLEMENTS RIDE, KNOCKING THAT RIVAL OFF STRIDE AND COSTING HIM A CHANCE AT A BETTER
PLACING.
