Footnotes
JUST ADORABLE was nicely rated between rivals down the backstretch, then shifted to the three path on the turn, dug in gamely in the upper stretch to
edge past the pace setter in the final furlong to claim the win in the end. IN A MINESHAFT saved ground behind the field while racing in the two path, then
swung six wide leaving the turn to close well down the lane and be up for the place prize. EARLY SPRING was away sharply to set the pace from the inside,
cleared the turn but was over powered in the late stretch by an outer rival and was best for third in the end. MEDAGLIA'S SONG raced in the middle of the
field from the inside, was urging steadily on the turn but came up evenly in the stretch. MIA IS SHORT was off slowly at the start then settled along the rail
and passed tired foes in the end. CREAM PUFF REAPER chased the pace from the inside in the early furlongs then flattened out in the stretch and needed
more in the end. TOUCH WITT CLASS chased the pace while three wide, was under a strong drive throughout the turn, then weakened in the stretch.

and racing three wide on the backstretch, made a bid on the far turn and dug in gamely to be second best in the end. CINNAMON FACE vied for the lead
while between rivals on the backstretch, was carried out to the middle of the far turn then came again in the stretch to finish well in the end. FAYETTE BLUE
vied for the lead while three wide then was carried out to the middle of the far turn and lacked a strong closing bid. RUN WITT RUN vied for the lead while
inside, bore out badly blowing the far turn then faltered in the stretch drive. CAPETOWN CANDY was unhurried early and two wide on the backstretch but
failed to menace in the stretch. KEEP THE BLING trailed throughout. A steward's inquiry was held concerning the run into the far turn. After reviewing the
