SCREEN SAVER vied outside, shook clear on the final turn then held rival safe through the stretch in a steady drive. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE went after
the winner on the final turn, loomed a threat but was outfinished. CARTIER CAT raced wide off the pace, split foes in the stretch to gain show. SOCIAL
GROUP hustled to a narrow lead inside, lost the advantage before half a mile and proved empty in the stretch. JUPI'S LIGHTNING saved ground close up,
moved briefly closer on the final turn then faded. MAKABIM sluggish early, chased very wide and lacked a solid rally. ICY STORM was urged close up three

Footnotes
IFIHADACHANCE settled off the dueling leaders, bid four wide on the turn then wore down the leader in the final furlong. QUEEN CADENCE well placed
inside, advanced outside on the turn and closed well. REITERATE dueled outside, took over on the turn then weakened late. COACH HAS SIX ACES
lacked speed outside, blocked near the five sixteenths then offered some late energy. SENSE A MILLION dropped back inside, was blocked and steadied at
the quarter pole and again at the top of the stretch. STARSHIP ROGUE prompted the pace inside, steadied and dropped back at the three eighths pole.
PEYTON'S COLLEGE lacked speed and was never involved. WISHING ONA PRAYER earned a narrow advantage between rivals early then stopped.

Footnotes
SEVIER set the pace racing with a clear lead, showed the way on the far turn, responded when roused in upper stretch and remained clear under urging.
DOCTOR DOOM stalked two wide, chased the winner into the stretch, was no match for that rival and well clear for place honors. SUIGU STAR was outrun
early, moved up on the turn, went five wide past the quarter pole and rallied mildly for third. ET'S MAGIC MAN raced off the pace inside, chased on the far
turn and lacked a rally. STRUM AND PLUCK raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. EXCURSION stalked close up early racing three wide,
chased on the far turn and faded. JUST NOD AND SMILE raced off the pace and failed to respond when asked. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE tracked on the
inside, chased on the far turn and gave way.

continued gamely for the place. APOLLONIA VITELLI settled inside, bid three wide on the final turn and finished willingly. DREAMINGOFFREEDOM chased
in midpack then flattened out in the stretch. ALMA BRILHA rated well off the pace wide and lacked a solid rally. STELLA MIA dropped back along the inside
and never menaced. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY moved closer to the pacesetter before half a mile then retreated. LA SIERVA C dropped back wide and was
never in contention. SUMMERSATTHESHORE dropped back wide and weakened steadily. BAYNHAM raced close up inside for half a mile and stopped
abruptly. OUR LADY IN RED taken up just after the start, moved inside and stopped.

TOPS THE CHART controlled the pace inside, moved clear then collared in midstretch and held on gamely in a long drive. ROADTRIPTONOWHERE close
up inside, bid and was taken up inside the winner at the quarter pole, angled out finished willingly but could not get by. MY IMAGINATION lagged far behind
then offered some late energy. SIMOVITCH prompted the pace outside for three quarters then proved empty. OVERLY CRITICAL settled close up outside
opening half mile and weakened. RICH'S WAY trailed after the initial quarter moved wide on the final turn and was no factor. TEN GAUGE dropped back
into the first turn and was never involved. THE KHOZAN ONE chased off the leaders outside and gave way readily. The stewards posted an inquiry into the
incident at the quarter pole and the rider of the second finisher claimed foul against the winner but the result was allowed to stand.
