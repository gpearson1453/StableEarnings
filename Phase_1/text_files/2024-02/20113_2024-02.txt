Footnotes
VALTESSE vied for the early lead, drove clear around the turn and was kept to the task. NON BINDING raced within striking distance, came around the turn
wide, made an outside gain and finished willingly. SAVANNAH'S HERE dueled on the front end, came in around the turn, clipped heels with GAP DADDY
and proved no match for the top two. CRYPTO BRAVE showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and weakened. MYDEALOFTHEDAY challenged
for the early advantage and faded. TENPINS TEMPEST had an awkward start, trailed early, moved up, but was no factor. JUST A WIN lacked early speed
and was never a factor. GAP DADDY pressed the pace, clipped heels around the turn, saved ground and faded. MOODY RAFAELA showed early speed,
raced outside around the turn and dropped back. WHORL GIRL void of early speed, raced outside around the turn and showed little. THE JOCKEY OF #1
GAP DADDY LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST #2 SAVANNAH'S HERE FOR INTERFERENCE AROUND THE TURN. AFTER VIEWING REPLAYS
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED #2 FROM 3RD AND PLACED HER 8TH.

Footnotes
SECOND OF JULY sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and proved much the best. INTO WISHING raced within contention, made a late bid,
proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. HAIL SOUTHERN raced within contention, came around the first turn on the outside, proved no
match for the top tow, but held off HAPPY BOY ROCKET for third. HAPPY BOY ROCKET broke a step slow, racing from the rear, made a late gain, racing
wide and was outfinished for third. SMOKY TOPAZ raced in the middle of the field, saved ground and put forth an even effort. REVENIR lacked early speed,
raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. YES BAB raced evenly near the back and showed little. PRAY IDE SING pressed the early pace, saved
ground around the second turn and dropped back.
