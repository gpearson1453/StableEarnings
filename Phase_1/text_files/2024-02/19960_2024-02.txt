Footnotes
MISCHIEVOUS EMMA prompted outside of the leader and from the three path into the turn, got carried out by that lugging foe while offering a bid
approaching the lane, vied through midstretch and drew clear at the sixteenth pole. SEE YOU AT THE TOP raced at the rear in the four path, ran on to offer
a inside bid for place in the late stages and edged that position in the shadow of the wire. DAHLIA'S DANCER set the pace in the two path as an outer rival
applied pressure, but bore out nearing the lane while meeting that one's bid, fought on while getting headed in midstretch but yielded with a sixteenth to go
and lost place in the closing stages. ROSES FOR SUZZETT chased in the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
PAID IN FULL showed the way in the two path, led in hand as an outer rival applied pressure around the far turn, kicked away from that one entering the
lane and drew off under very light urging. CONRAD THE RED was last away, rated at the rear in the four path, moved forward between horses to gain place
at the half mile pole, took aim while pressing the leader from the three path around the far turn, but yielded to that one entering the lane yet remained well
clear of the rest. HEARTBREAK KID stalked in the four to five path, failed to keep pace with the top pair entering the far turn, got floated out by an inner rival
around that bend and improved position while failing to menace. WESTERBERG pressed the leader from the three to four path entering the backstretch, but
chased among foes soon after and faded into the far turn. JOHN'S KID tracked along the inside, failed to keep pace with the top pair entering the far turn,
lugged out while giving way around that bend then weakened between horses.

GODSEND showed the way in the the three path, drew off nearing the lane and was ridden out. QUALITY RAGS trailed along the inside, picked up stride
swinging to the five path turning for home, gained place entering the lane and was second best. CHIEFS BLANKET stalked in the two path, chased into and
around the turn, attempted a place bid nearing the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival entering it and failed to threaten thereafter. DAVID'S FAITH
tracked in the five path and faded turning for home. GOALINE pressed the eventual winner from the four path, but gave way at the quarter pole and faded
between horses.

QUEENS EFFORT showed the way in the three path as an outer rival applied moderate pressure, inched clear of that one while shifting out with five
sixteenths to go, then held sway through the lane. NYQUILER pressed the leader from the four path, chased that clearing rival turning for home, vied for
place with an inner rival in upper stretch, repelled that one while shifting inwardly at the sixteenth pole and ran on willingly. NORTHERN COCKTAIL broke
awkwardly, chased from midpack while under urging along the inside into the turn, progressed turning for home to bid for place entering upper stretch, vied
for that position through midstretch but was turned away while getting floated inwardly with a sixteenth to go. SEA BREEZE BOY was bumped and floated
outwardly by an inner foe at the start, pursued two wide, shifted to the five path entering the lane and failed to factor. COUNTRY BOY stalked the top pair
from the five path but gave way into the turn. WOLF'S LIFE broke out and bumped a rival at the start, then was outrun along the inside.

LETTHERAINSETTLEIT stalked the leader from the three path, pressed under urging around the far turn, bid entering the lane, dueled through the final
furlong and narrowly prevailed at the wire. IL CAPITANO set a clear pace in the two path early on, led from an outer presser around the far turn, met that
foe's challenge entering the lane, dueled gamely through the final furlong but was nailed at the wire. CREATIVE WAY brushed with an outer rival at the
start, pursued from midpack along the inside early on before taking closer order down the backstretch, but chased while failing to keep pace with the top pair
around the far turn and held show through the lane. SANTALUZ DREAMIN tracked from the four path and failed to threaten. TONE FEELIN broke a step
slow and brushed with an inner foe at the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, then failed to factor. KIRBY DERBY trailed in the three
path and was outrun.

JAIME'S COMMITMENT prompted three to two wide and between horses, dueled with his inner counterpart through the lane and prevailed. SCOPELLO set
a pressured pace, gamely dueled with an outer rival through the lane but was bested late. DRISKILL tracked along the inside, swung outside of the leaders
and to the five path entering the lane, then ran on to gain show in the shadow of the wire. NOTACRY broke outwardly, pressed four to three wide, but gave
way to the top pair in upper stretch and got nailed at the wire for show. B R KIDD ROCK trailed into the turn and never got involved. SHINING TIGER was
last away and made little impact. SIMPLY ELEMENTARY prompted two wide and between horses, but took back approaching the turn, chased and faded.
