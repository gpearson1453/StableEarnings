Footnotes
SAVED BY GRACE broke half a beat slow and was lightly grazed by an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path and between horses,
tracked the main group around the far turn, tipped outside of them and to the five path entering the lane, rallied to bid at the sixteenth pole and drove clear.
LEGALLY LUCKY showed the way along the inside, then a path off of the rail around the far turn, maintained an advantage through midstretch, but was
collared by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole, got bested by that one soon after then saved place. DREAMING ALWAYS settled off of the pace along the
inside, moved out turning for home, tipped to the six path entering the lane and rallied while hanging on his left lead to miss reaching place. LILY'S CREED
broke inwardly and brushed a rival at the start, pressed two wide, required coaxing to sustain pressure along with an outer bidder while taking the far turn
inn the the three path, then gave way in upper stretch. FRONT AND SILVER tracked two wide, ranged up outside of the top pair and from the four path
around the far turn, attempted a bid entering the lane but faded between horses shortly after. CANA GRIS stalked along the inside, chased into the lane and
lacked a bid. PLANTS AND BIRDS was brushed by an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear caught in the four path around the first turn and was done
early.

Footnotes
GRACELEADSUSHOME set the pace inside of a pulling prompter entering the backstretch, shook free of that bidder in upper stretch and lasted from an
outer pursuer to the wire. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY settled off of the pace in the four path, advanced three wide into the far turn, progressed to be within
striking range of the top pair nearing the lane, but drifted out to the seven path entering it, ran on in pursuit through midstretch, closed in on the clear leader
in the late stages but needed more to reel her in. FORT POLK rated at the rear in the two path, advanced three wide around the far turn before tipping to the
six path entering the lane, then shifted in and stayed on between horses to gain show in the final furlong. SHE TOLD YOU SO laid off of the pace in the
three path and between horses, retreated to trail along the inside around the far turn, then moved up. MONEY WELL SPENT pulled three wide around the
first turn to prompt outside of the leader entering the backstretch, pressed two wide into the far turn, bid shifting out to the four path entering the lane, but
drifted out approaching midstretch and gave way. LOVERS NEVER SAY stalked in the two path and between horses early on, chased the top pair into the
far turn and gave way through the lane. FOLLOW THE SAINT tracked along the inside, pursued two wide and between horses turning for home, then tired.

SHEZAPERFECTDREAM set the pace inside of a prompting rival, shook clear of that one in upper stretch and held sway from an outer pursuer. RADIANT
REBEL stalked along the inside, shouldered an outer rival to secure inside position entering the turn, tipped outside of the top pair turning for home, took
aim in upper stretch but only managed to chase the clearing leader home. STEAL ME OVER was bumped between horses while put to cramped quarters
through the opening stages, aid off of the pace three wide and ran on willingly. MY IDEA broke slowly, trailed in the three path, swung to the six path
entering the lane and rallied outside of rivals. BETONYA pressed outside of the leader, prompted turning for home, but faltered between horses in upper
stretch while hanging on her left lead, then lugged inwardly in the final furlong. AMERICAN CHICK was bumped and put to crowded quarters among foes at
the start, raced off of the pace two wide and between horses and failed to factor. DARK SKYER was jostled between horses at the start, pursued from
midpack in the three to two path into the turn, but steadied hard behind a faltering rival at the five sixteenths pole and failed to recover. GIGI'S LUV chased
two wide and between horses, bumped with an inner rival into the turn, then gave way turning for home. OUR INDIAN GIRL chased forwardly in the four to
five path and caved in upper stretch. HOLY MOLY SHIPMAN bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued form midpack along the inside but weakened
around the turn.

TROUBLE FREE tracked three to four wide, rallied to bid along with an inner rival leaving midstretch, sparred with that one through the late stages and
proved best. LET'S GO BRANDI broke in the air and was off slow, rushed forward to track along the inside, tipped off the rail entering the lane, rallied to bid
along with an outer rival in the final furlong, battled through the closing stages but was denied. TRIBEST (ARG) set the pace along the inside, drew clear
nearing the lane, but was bested by a pair of outer bidders in the final furlong and saved show. CHROME RACER pursued from midpack in the two path,
swung out to the six path entering the lane and ran on to miss gaining show. MARIAH raced forwardly two wide and between horses, but yielded entering
the lane, shifted out soon after but lacked a re-rally. DYLAN'S DREAM brushed with an inner rival at the start and failed to factor from the three path. MISS
PEARL HART pressed three to two wide into the turn, but weakened between horses after being floated three wide entering the lane. HIGHER NOTE broke
a step slow, lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. IMPERATOR FURIOSA brushed with an outer rival at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SEVEN SCENTS saved ground off of the pace, bid up a vacated rail in upper stretch, kicked clear at the furlong grounds and held sway. ALICIA'S KID
broke a step slow, saved ground towards the rear, then rallied in the two path to edge place from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. PESO IN MY POCKET
tracked along the inside, advanced inside of outwardly-lugging rivals around the turn, tipped to take aim outside of the clear leader entering the lane, got
outkicked by an inner rival in upper stretch, flopped leads while re-claiming place at the furlong grounds but lost that position at the sixteenth pole. OF THE
MOMENT tracked two wide and between horses, took closer order around the turn, floated out entering the lane and chased evenly. GOLD PUNCH showed
the way, built a clear margin into the turn, but drifted out while being headed by an inner bidder in upper stretch and faded between horses. ROBO broke a
beat slow, raced well back in the three path and moved up. TOUGH CHARLIE stalked along the inside, but bore out to the three path into the turn, pursued
between horses nearing the lane, got float out entering it and gave way after delaying his lead change to midstretch. BABY BOOMER laid off of the pace
four wide, got floated to the five path around the turn, moved out to the seven to eight path in upper stretch and failed to factor. COROT pursued three to
two wide and between horses, then faded. JAKE THE BAND MAN stalked in the three path, got floated to the four path by an inner rival into the turn, then
weakened between horses nearing the lane.

Footnotes
MAHOMEBRED showed the way in the two path as an outer rival applied mild pressure around the turn, inched clear of that one in upper stretch and slowly
widened under moderate handling. BEAUXS ARTES pressed outside of the eventual winner and from the three path, required urging to sustain mild
pressure around the turn, then chased the leader through the lane and pulled well clear of the rest. PURRFECT MOON dropped back soon after the start,
trailed along the inside, advanced in upper stretch, tipped to the three path at the furlong grounds and sustained progress to reach show leaving the
sixteenth pole. SAPPHIRE NIGHTS settled off of the pace in the two path, moved up and claimed show from an inner rival at the furlong grounds but lost
that position entering the final sixteenth. MY LADY LUNA laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, then improved position. SUM CHARM
chased along the inside and weakened. MALLY'S MONSOON failed to factor from the four path. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE tracked in the four path and
between horses, but tired through the lane. BEDOWNTOFOOLAROUND pursued from midpack in the five path and weakened.

Footnotes
FOXXY CLEOPATRA showed the way along the inside, built a clear margin into the turn and held sway. TIPSY RUNNER lacked speed along the inside,
swung out to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied to reach place late. COPPER EM stalked outside of the leader, chased that through the lane and
was outkicked by an outer bidder for place late. FLEET FROST leaned into the inner part of the starting gate and was off slow at the start, recovered to
pursue from midpack along the inside into the turn, then ran on willingly between horses in the final furlong. REGAL RUMOR laid off of the pace two wide
and between horses, moved out to the five to six path in upper stretch and sustained a chase thereafter. SPIN THE BREEZE bumped with an outer rival at
the start, trailed in the two path, swung out to the seven to eight path in upper stretch and moved up. MYA'S HALO chased forwardly along the inside, but
lacked a bid before yielding in the final furlong. CHEEKY GAL laid off of the pace three to two wide and failed to menace between horses. INTEGRATED
DESIGN pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, drifted out slightly in upper stretch while chasing and faded between horses late. WONDER
OF YOU tracked three wide, got floated to the four to five path in upper stretch and faded between horses. PLAY GOOD PAY GOOD brushed the inner part
of the gate and bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace four to six wide and faded.

Footnotes
FREDDIE BY A NOSE tracked from midpack along the inside, shifted out down the backstretch, bid four wide turning for home and drew clear. TAKEOVER
FIFTYFOUR stalked along the inside, got outmoved by a wide bidder while awaiting racing room behind foes turning for home, slipped through to gain place
from outer rivals at the furlong grounds and was second best. BREAKING STAR tracked in the five to four path, chased three wide and between horses
around the far turn, then yielded yet saved show. CANAL ST. CUPID lacked speed in the two path, checked off rivals heels to tip between horses at the
quarter pole, moved out to the five path in upper stretch and rallied to miss show. BOLIE set the pace in the two path, got headed by an outer bidder
entering upper stretch and gave way between horses. MIDLAND KID lacked speed along the inside, took the far turn in the five to six path and moved up.
KAH NIGH laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and failed to menace. NO MORE WORDS stalked four to two wide around
the first turn, but weakened between horses turning for home. YOCKEY DOODLEDANDY tracked two wide and between horses but weakened around the
far turn. TABLEAUX RESEAUX bobbled at the start, lacked speed in the four path early on and was outrun. POETIC ROAD laid off of the pace three to four
wide and tired.
