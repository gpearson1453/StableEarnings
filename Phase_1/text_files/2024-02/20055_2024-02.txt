PAISLEY'S VISION showed speed inside horses while in the three path down the backstretch, was challenged on her outside by GET MY POINT on the
turn, battled determinedly inside that one through the stretch and narrowly prevailed. GET MY POINT , up close down the backstretch, bid for the lead
outside the winner on the turn, dueled through the lane and just missed. BEA MISCHIEF , jostled on both sides about a furlong after the start, moved up five
deep on the turn then flattened out. SEE YOU AT THE TOP chased the pace, raced near the inner rail on the turn and failed to sustain her bid.
ASSUREDLY , a forward factor in the two path inside horses to the turn, swung out approaching the stretch and weakened. VALDINI , outrun, raced near
the inner rail on the turn and was vanned off.

DISCRETIONARY DAY , sent to the early lead, was kept mostly in the three path, was challenged on his outside by PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL on the far
turn, battled with that one, put him away inside the sixteenth pole then lasted. LEGALLY REDDY showed speed in the two path on the backstretch and into
the far turn, dropped back a bit on the turn, swung four wide entering the stretch and gamely rebid outside the winner. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL , four wide
both turns, bid for the lead on the far turn, battled to inside the sixteenth pole and weakened late. THE RONALD raced near the inner rail throughout and
flattened out. CARPE BELLUM , in the three path the far turn swung to the five path at the head of the lane and failed to threaten. CAPIAT raced between
horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary rally. PANZER PRIDE , fanned six deep at the head of the stretch, came up empty. STAR PROSPECT , four
wide the first turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
REDLINE saved ground around both turns, remained inside horses in the stretch, advanced to take the lead inside the sixteenth pole and lasted. TRUTH
SEEKER , kept outside horses throughout, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch and closed nicely outside rivals. TULANE TRYST set the pace in
the two path and gave way grudgingly between horses. HOLDEN THE LUTE , four wide the first turn, was in striking range the far turn and flattened out
between horses. DIAMOND RIM worked between horses in the stretch and lacked the necessary response. TONY'S TAPIT , four wide the first turn, chased
the pace and weakened. PRINCE LANCELOT (GB) , four wide both turns, chased the pace and weakened. MY MAN BIGGIE , no factor, was eased.

Footnotes
WORK N FLIRT , chased the pace outside the leader, took command about seventy yards from the finish and drove clear. FEEL FREE bobbled at the
break, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace slightly off the rail, finished willingly but failed to hold off the winner. JESSICA BLAH BLAH chased the pace,
circled the turn three wide, weakened in the drive and his rider dropped his whip entering the lane. PARCO swung to the outside about a furlong after the
start and was no factor. HELLO BABY saved ground on the turn and lacked a rally. KATALEYA raced along the inner rail on the turn and was not a factor.
UPTOWN RHAPSODY was always far back.
