Footnotes
SHARP LORENZO stalked the top trio two wide into the turn, moved out to the four path at the quarter pole, chased three deep into the lane, closed in from
outside, drew alongside the runner-up in the final sixteenth and drove past. NESSO'S LASTHARRAH vied for the lead from inside, inched clear around the
bend, remained unchallenged to midstretch, confronted by SHARP LORENZO past the sixteenth pole and yielded late. DES DOIGTS away quickly and vied
three deep up the backstretch and around the turn, lost touch with NESSO'S LASTHARRAH at the quarter pole, chased two wide into the lane and
weakened. MIDNIGHT LOVE stalked the leaders from outside, rounded the bend three then four wide and weakened in the stretch run. BEER MONEY
showed speed and battled between rivals in the early going, continued to fight from between to the five-sixteenths pole, started to see NESSO'S
LASTHARRAH slip away approaching the quarter pole, chased two wide then along the rail into the lane and weakened. RUNNING TIGER bobbled a bit at
the start to lose a step, chased from off the pace, saved ground while coming under a ride on the turn and could not make an impact. FACT OR FICTION
bothered by outer rival shortly after the start, began to climb racing at the back early along the inside, shifted off the fence entering the turn, traveled four
wide midway around the bend before steered back into the two path and failed to menace.

Footnotes
NAUVOO dueled outside PACO'S PICO into the clubhouse turn then cleared around the bend, carried a comfortable lead in the two path through the far
turn, began to widen when roused and asked left handed in upper stretch and was lightly coaxed through the final sixteenth. BIG BUZZ reserved at the back
and tucked inside, came off the rail entering the backstretch, traveled three deep on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and offered a mild rally to best
the rest. DIVINE FEMININE tracked in the three path around the first turn, ridden along still off the inside on the second bend, lacked a bid in the final
furlong but churned on for the show honors. PACO'S PICO dueled from inside into the first turn then ceded command to NAUVOO and moved off the rail
around the bend, chased three wide leaving the backstretch, angled down to the inside, steered back out entering the stretch and weakened.
SETTECENTO chased two wide then moved to the rail on the first turn, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a response when called upon.

ZEYARAAT chased three wide for a bit then applied pressure from outside, took over early on the far turn, put away TAPIT DOUX approaching the quarter
pole under hand urging, powered away in upper stretch and cruised through the final sixteenth. TAPIT DOUX cleared and moved into the two path before
taking pressure from ZEYARAAT, held a short lead along the rail into the far turn, relinquished the lead at the three-eighths pole, failed to kick on with the
winner approaching the quarter pole, weakened in the lane but churned on to secure second. QUARIA THUNDER stalked on the inside around the
clubhouse turn, trailed in range up the backstretch, dropped back on the far turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
LETTHELIQUORTALK broke in to bother TAKAMAKAHARA, challenged SMILING JOJO for command early, inched ahead at the seven-sixteenths pole,
cleared midway around the bend, opened up in upper stretch and kept to task to the wire. GOSTOSO bobbled shortly after the start, sat off the pace, went
five wide into the turn, angled down to the two path while passing rivals around the bend, finished willingly through the lane but made no impact on the
winner. TAKAMAKAHARA got forced in at the start and dropped back, saved ground through the turn and was along for the show. SMILING JOJO took
control early then dueled outside LETTHELIQUORTALK up the backstretch, lost command entering the far turn, chased past the five-sixteenths pole and
weakened in the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS DYLAN pressed the pace briefly then chased off the rail, took the turn three wide then moved out leaving the bend
and came five wide into the stretch and weakened. TIGER BY THE TAIL chased between rivals up the backstretch, four wide around the turn and came up
empty in the drive. SUNSET STORM chased three deep and five wide into the turn, remained wide into the lane and failed to menace.

Footnotes
TOP GUN TOMMY showed early speed from inside then chased HABEAS up the backstretch, tipped out into the lane, bid between rivals and put a head in
front in upper stretch, dueled with LANSDOWNE (GB) through the final furlong and dug in to prevail. LANSDOWNE (GB) forwardly placed from outside,
driven three wide into the lane, challenged three deep in upper stretch, battled head to head with TOP GUN TOMMY in the furlong grounds but lacked the
needed final kick to get by. HABEAS stumbled and bumped with outer rival at the start, sent between rivals to clear the field, showed the way two wide
through the turn, yielded in upper stretch and managed to save third. ESTABLISHED raced in range earl off the rail, took the turn four wide, tipped outside a
rival entering the stretch and could not rally. CROWNING GOLD brushed with HABEAS leaving the gate, dueled for the lead briefly then ceded command,
stalked two wide into the turn, angled three then four wide late on the bend and tired.

Footnotes
SAND TO SEA bumped with outer rival at the start, took control early and moved inside, set the pace with HEY DEMPS alongside on the backstretch,
dueled with that rival on the far turn, shook free in upper stretch and drew away. HEY DEMPS stumbled sharply at the start, chased four then three wide
early, drew alongside the leader in the middle stages, dueled around the far turn, lost could not keep up with the winner in upper stretch and stayed on to
hold second. ISABEL LUDLOW bumped with SAND TO SEA in the beginning, chased two wide around the first turn, went three deep into the second bend,
chased two wide into the lane and kept on for a clear third. WARREN'S PARADICE settled inside at the back, went between rivals leaving the backstretch,
moved over to the rail past the five-sixteenths pole and weakened in the stretch run. IN HER PRYME tracked the pace from inside, started to weaken on the
far turn, tipped out to the two path leaving the bend and came up empty. BOUGIE LIKE raced up close three then two wide on the clubhouse turn, dropped

SWEET AZTECA dueled outside POWER SURGE to the turn, inched ahead on the turn before clearing at the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch under
some coaxing and coasted through the final furlong in an easy victory. NOKIE chased well off the rail while in range at the back early, rounded the bend
three to four wide, kept on willingly through the stretch run and bested the rest. POWER SURGE took control early then dueled with SWEET AZTECA up
the backstretch, fought to the five-sixteenths pole, could not kick on with the winner with a quarter mile left to run, weakened in the lane but managed to hold
on for third. VITALERA (CHI) stalked the leaders up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and missed the show. LLORONA stalked the top pair off
the inside, spun three wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
ULTIMATE AUTHORITY cleared quickly from outside and crossed over, took a stalking position around the clubhouse turn, inched closer outside a rival
leaving the backstretch, challenged from outside on the far turn, took over in upper stretch and maintained a short advantage over WHERE'S MY RING to
the wire. WHERE'S MY RING chased briefly then went up to challenge five wide into the first turn, cleared inner rivals and crossed over, moved over to the
inside on the backstretch, pressured by ULTIMATE AUTHORITY around the far turn, overtaken by that rival in upper stretch, fought back gamely from inside
but had to settle for second best. BRUNCH WITH AMY steadied three wide into the first turn then dropped back off the pace while moving to the four path,
chased three deep at the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the lane and edged rivals for the show. SPEED SHOPPER hit the gate and bobbled at
the start, climbed a bit and dropped back three then two wide, got boxed in traffic from the quarter to the top of the stretch, moved to a clear path and
missed third. CRITICISM steadied in the two path entering the first turn, chased three then two wide on the second bend and lacked a rally. GATE TO
PARADISE broke a step slow, saved ground along the inside, moved off the fence int he stretch and was not a factor. SHE'Z THE LAW showed early speed
in the four path into the first turn then moved down to the two path while chasing the new leader, started to weaken two wide then along the rail on the far
turn and tired. down the lane. GLO GLO steadied a bit off the heels of the winner two wide into the first turn, moved out to the four path around the bend,
continued wide through the second turn and had little left for the stretch run.
