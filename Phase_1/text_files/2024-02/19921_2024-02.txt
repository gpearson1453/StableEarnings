Footnotes
BREEZER set the pace in the two path and widened under confident handling. HECHICERO prompted the winner in the three path and was clearly second
best. MOBY WARRIOR tracked the pace from the rail and lacked the needed rally. BUILDER JAK was in a bit tight early, saved ground off the pace, angled
out in upper stretch and was one-paced through the lane. DECISIVE WARRIOR chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. REBEL JACKSON
unseated the rider and ran loose the length of the chute prior to the race, hit the starting gate to break last, trailed in the two path around the turn, swung out
turning for home and lugged in through the stretch.

Footnotes
REFUEL set the pace in the two path, was nudged along around the turn, cued from the three path into the lane, and inched clear in the final furlong. TEST
FACTOR stalked inside, was roused passing the quarter, swung from the three path into the stretch, drifted out to the six path nearing the sixteenth, and ran
on for place. BOURBON BOSS laid up close in the four path, bid around the turn, and kept on for show. URGE TO MERGE (IRE) broke slowly, rated in the
four path, angled out to the six path under a ride turning into the stretch, was herded out slightly passing the sixteenth, and flattened. BIVOL tracked in the
two path, was coaxed along around the turn, but made no impact. TROUBLEMEISTER had a slow start, chased in the five path, fanned out to the eight path
turning into the lane, but failed to bid. SOAR RICHARD prompted the pace in the three path entering the turn, but weakened along the inside in the stretch.
MELLIFLUOUS trailed throughout from the two to four paths.

ASHIMA pressed the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide around the far turn, took over near the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under
left-handed urging. WOW LUCKY was fractious in the gate, had her head turned at the start, trailed inside, edged closer two wide between foes around the
far turn, angled three wide turning for home and rallied for the place. SINGING SANDRA raced in range two wide, lacked the needed rally but kept on for the
show. RED SUN DRESS set the pace in the two path around the first turn and along the rail around the far turn and faltered leaving the five-sixteenths
marker. NUNOFTHISNUNOFTHAT raced up close three wide and faded after a half. NO FAKE chased the pace from the rail and had no response.

SCARAMANGA chased along the inside and was ridden into the turn, swung out to the five path turning into the lane, took the lead while drifting out passing
the eighth pole, and continued to drift out while drawing clear. UPSTREET laid off the pace in the two path, was coaxed along in the three path around the
turn, fanned out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. JAMES GANG prompted the pace in the three path, took command in the two
path nearing the three-eighths, but looked to be fading on his left lead passing the eighth pole, switched to his right lead just after, and dug in to get back up
for show. ONE AMERICA stalked in the two path, was roused in the three path approaching the quarter, but flattened from the four path down the lane. BE
LUCKY set the pace inside, but lost the lead approaching the three-eighths, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, and faded. SMOKIN BOW fell well
behind while out in the center and was eased through the stretch.

LIGHTING CLOUDS settled off the duel in the two path, angled four wide near the quarter pole, seized command in upper stretch and drew off under
left-handed urging. OUR LEGAL TENDER vied inside down the backstretch, rated back midway around the turn, angled out in upper stretch, continued on
the left lead in the lane and kept on to gain the place. VINSANITY saved ground off the pace, angled three wide near the five-sixteenths pole, ran on outside
and just missed second. EL CHATO failed to menace while racing four wide. OZONE dueled three wide and weakened through the lane. BINGO WAS HIS
NAME dueled two wide between foes and tired in the drive. HERMOSO HOMBRE trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
ADMISSIBLE bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the
lane, rallied into the final furlong, bumped with an inner foe twice in the final sixteenth, but got up on the wire. DRUM ROLL laid up close in the three path,
bid around the turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch, inched past the inner pacesetter to briefly lead close to home, but was nailed at the
wire by an outer foe to place. WISE AND ELEGANT bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid off the pace in the two path, was coaxed while floating out to
the six path turning into the lane, bumped with the outer winner twice in the final sixteenth, and kept on for show. DELTA CHARM set the pace inside, was
roused turning into the stretch, dug in to hold on to the lead entering the final furlong, but was caught by an outer trio late. BUSY MORNING stalked in the
two path, tipped out to the five path under a ride turning into the lane, but was one paced. BUSTIN BULLET tracked in the three path but faded in the
stretch.

Footnotes
IMPROPTUDE bumped at the start, raced in range inside, bid at the rail nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving that marker, dueled inside of
ARROGANCY throughout the stretch and prevailed. ARROGANCY prompted the pace four wide, reached near even terms turning for home, dueled outside
of the winner to the wire and just missed. THE MONOPOLY MAN was bumped at the start, had speed between foes, steadied entering the turn, dropped
back in the three path then re-rallied in the stretch to gain the show. ETENDRE disputed the pace in the three path and weakened in the lane. SNEAK
PREVIEW was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. KINSMAN REDEEMER broke through the gate prior to the start
but never escaped the assistant starter, saved ground off the pace and never threatened. IRON TAP failed to menace while racing three wide. FLAT CAP
was pinched back at the start, raced five wide and never contended. ROARING INDIAN broke slowly, rushed up inside, dueled at the rail for three furlongs
and retreated.
