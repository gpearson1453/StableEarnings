Footnotes
SHE TAKES CASH broke outwardly, raced off the pace two wide, bulled through three wide turning for home, seized command near the eighth pole and
drew clear under a drive. LORRAINE (FR) broke a bit awkwardly, raced in range two wide early, edged closer three wide, was pushed four wide turning for
home by the winner, could not match strides with that foe in the lane but stayed on to be clearly second best. BONMATI dueled two wide to midstretch and
held well enough for the show. WHO LADY WHO dueled at the rail to midstretch and weakened. CHANNEL LOOP raced up close three wide and faltered
nearing the quarter pole. AN OBJECTION LODGED THE RIDER OF LORRAINE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE
QUARTER POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
WHAT'S GOOD stalked inside, was roused approaching the quarter, angled out to the five path turning into the lane, and rallied past an inner duo in the
final furlong. STARLIT SOFI pulled around the first turn to prompt the pace in the two path down the backside, bid around the far turn, ran on to lead while
floating out to the four path passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe to place. TIZ ERIN was held up in the two path early, had to steady
passing the half, tipped outward to the five path under a drive down the lane, and kept on for show. NAA DUDETTE trailed in the four path turning into the
backstretch, was cued early into the far turn, cut the corner turning into the lane, but made no impact. ARISAEMA rated in the four path, was coaxed in the
five path midway around the far turn, but failed to bid from the seven path in the stretch. CHARMEINE bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the
three path, was driven in the four path around the far turn, but flattened from the six path in the stretch. DARLING LUNA bumped with an outer foe at the
start, showed the way around the first turn to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, but faded in the two path down the lane. KITTEN'S WAR
raced off the pace in the three path but was no menace.

PRINCIPIA set the pace in two path, shook clear near the quarter and held clear under a drive. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA pressed the winner in the three
path, could not gain on that foe in the lane but kept on willingly for the place. ADIOS BABE settled off the pace while racing two wide, angled five wide in
upper stretch and ran on to gain the show in the final strides. GIRVIN GIRL stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole, tried to
split top two in upper stretch but was unable to match strides and lost third in the final strides. ESOTERIC had her head turned at the start, chased the pace
four wide and lacked a closing bid. TOO MUCH VINO trailed in the two path.

Footnotes
BATTALION BOUND bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the two path, was ridden from the rail around the turn, tipped out to the four path
turning into the lane, hung on his left lead, but inched ahead of an inner foe passing the sixteenth, and just held off an outer foe to get the nod.
GINGERSNAP JACK raced off the pace in the four path, was roused from the two path midway around the turn, drifted out to the six path passing the eighth
pole, and ran on for place. MAKIZAN set the pace in the three path, was driven from the two path into the turn, kept on to hold on to the lead going into the
final furlong, but faded late to show. TAPIT'S DIRECTION prompted the pace in the four path, was driven in the three path around the turn, but flattened.
TIZADUKE tracked in the six path, was ridden in the four path around the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but weakened. WILD
FLIGHT bumped with an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path and never threatened from out in the eight path in the stretch. SIR GOOSA stalked in
the five path but backed up in the three path around the turn.

Footnotes
CITIZEN K bumped shortly after the start and again nearing the first turn, raced off the pace two and three wide, swung widest in upper stretch, closed down
the center of the track and was up late. HOT BLOODED settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, swung eight
wide turning for home, rallied outside, took the lead near the sixteenth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging and was outkicked late. DOMINATE
THEMOMENT had his head turned at the start, well back two and three wide, shifted further out in upper stretch and rallied between foes to gain the show
late. HUSBAND MATERIAL saved ground in midpack, tipped out in upper stretch, bid between foes but was outkicked for the minor awards. STARSHIP
ABRAHAM pressed the pace two wide, took the lead in midstretch but weakened through the final furlong. KLICKITAT was bumped at the start, went a bit
wide into the first turn but angled to the rail soon after, saved ground from there and rallied belatedly at the rail. UNCLE CURLY was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace three wide and had a mild stretch gain. CALL MY BANKER stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and
lacked a rally while under intermittent urging and sometimes lacking an ideal path in the stretch. OXYMORE set the pace along the rail, yielded near the
eighth pole and steadied when in tight very late. PUTIN ONLINE bumped with the winner nearing the first turn, raced in range two wide and lacked a closing
bid. SWAN LAKE failed to menace while racing four wide. LIGHT FURY stalked the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CAVU set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. STARSHIP SUNRISE pressed the winner in the three path, could not get past that foe and
lasted for the place. GITANA chased the pace five wide, rallied outside and just missed second. LOVIN MAKES CENTS had her head turned at the start
then bumped with FOXY LADY, raced up close between foes down the backstretch, steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker, stalked the pace in the four
path around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and was one-paced between rivals. AVATAL HERO went evenly while racing two wide. CLAY
SOLDIER hit the starting gate, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened. FOXY LADY was bumped at the start, chased the pace from the rail and
lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
ABUNDANCIA laid up close along the inside, tipped out to the two path around the turn, was coaxed approaching the quarter, tipped out to the four path to
bid passing the eighth pole, and drew clear of an inner foe in the final sixteenth. SENSE YOU LEFT set the pace in the two path, was cued along the inside
midway around the turn, kept on from the two path into the stretch, but was caught before the sixteenth by an outer foe to place. MAMA MARIA stalked in
the three path, was ridden around the turn, hung on her left lead from the five path in the stretch, but held show. GREAT ANALOGY bumped with an inner
foe at the start, raced off the pace in the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the lane, but made no impact. STEEL RACER bumped with an
outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path but flattened in the stretch. RITA'S ONTHE BEACH raced wellback in the four path and never threatened.
MISS UCRANIA chased in the five path but was no menace from the eight path in the stretch.
