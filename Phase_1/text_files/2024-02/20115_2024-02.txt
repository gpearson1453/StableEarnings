CRUZ IN THE CASTLE broke outward and exchanged sharp contact with Reine Secret then set a pressured pace, contested the edge nearest the rail on
the turn and dug in determinedly to eke out the advantage over the stretch challenge of MAKE IT A DOUBLE, who gave chase inside and had aim in the
four path on the turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. TRUE HEIRESS gave chase inside, raced near the rail on the turn and was
outfinished in the duel through the stretch. GRANDIOSELY came away a bit rank and was pinched back on the chute, picked up the chase through the
backstretch, raced in the five path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. REINE SECRET was reluctant to load, broke inward and exchanged sharp contact
with Cruz In The Castle then pressured the pace, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn but weakened in the lane. SCARLET TANAGER
was pulled up with a fatal injury and had to be euthanized on the track.

Footnotes
TAPIO stalked inside then picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to
edge out MINEOLA MIKE through the lane. The latter settled off the pace in the three and four paths, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole and took a
slim lead three wide midway on the far turn, but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. ALPHA WHISKEY rated a slim lead off the rail, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, was met midway on the far turn and flattened mid-stretch. SUPERSTITIEUX raced in the five path the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the five path, left the turn outside and showed little in the lane.
SCHMEAR raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and rounded the far turn near the rail, but showed little further. SIR SMOAK
stalked inside on the first turn, gave chase from the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, eased out leaving the turn but flattened
in the lane. STAVANGER raced off the rail the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. CHROME HEIR raced in the four path the first
turn and was not a factor. SPEIGHTS YOUR MIND raced well back. T VILLE rounded the opening turn about the five path, gave chase leaving the half mile
pole but faded from the seven sixteenths.

deep on the far turn and held on for second under steady handling. DOCTOR PARDO rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for second. PINNACLE REEF rated close inside on the opening
turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and was outfinished in the stretch duel for third. MEETMARYSMAN saved
ground on the first turn, picked up the chase past the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and ran evenly in the lane. CURB THAT TIGER
rounded the first turn about the three path, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch
before flattening stride. OCEAN STORM raced off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the half mile pole and could only improve his position. KING OF
LUCK raced two deep the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened. I SEE NOTHING
