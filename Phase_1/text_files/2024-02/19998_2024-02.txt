BLUE COWGIRL tracked the early pacesetters while racing five wide through the turn, was gaining steadily through the stretch and was up in time.
BROADWAY DISH pressed the early pace, raced along the inside into the turn, was eased back through the turn, re-rallied from the inside, took a brief lead,
met the bid of OUT ISLAND GIRL, held off that rival but could not hold off the winner and just missed. OUR ISLAND GIRL was allowed to settle early,
advanced four wide through the turn, dueled with VROADWAY DASH to let stretch and finished a game third. ANNIE GET UR GUNS was unhurried early,
loomed six wide through the turn, flattened out and vas vanned off. HALEY WHO was reserved off the early pace while racing three wide and offered no
rally. LAS TRES MARIPOSAS set a pressured early pace, went three wide and faded. FASHIONABLY QUICK was squeezed at the start, was void of speed
and never recovered.

rival to the wire and prevailed for the win. CHEROKEE CHERRY tracked the early pace, loomed seven wide through the turn, made a bid on the winner,
dueled to the wire and finished a game second. ATTILA STYLE was allowed to settle early, went three wide through the turn, angled in early stretch, was no
