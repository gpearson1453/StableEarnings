DIRECT THE SHOW gave chase, raced in the three path on the turn then dug in through the final furlong and took the nod under the wire. GREATEST
NOTION was hustled to the front past the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, dueled clear toward the quarter pole, dug in under steady stretch
encouragement but was nipped under the wire. SPYDYLEGS broke in the air then gave chase toward the outside, raced in the four path on the turn and
finished evenly to take third the final yards. GETTIN SPICY became a bit anxious in the gate then gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and flattened in
the lane. SHINEY GHOST pressured the early pace but dropped back approaching the quarter pole and weakened. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP ran wide and
was never a factor.

TOUGH ENOUGH took the lead and moved to the inside to set the pace, was under a hand ride nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn,
was steadily handled through the upper stretch then taken in hand later yards. MISS ANTIETAM settled off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward
the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane, flattened stride late but held on for second. SISTER SPIRIT
saved early ground then eased out and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and ran evenly to late stretch
before flattening stride. NANA'S BOOPA steadied shortly after the break, rounded the first turn about the four path then picked up the chase past the seven
sixteenths pole, ran in the five path on the far turn and passed some rivals. WE'LL SEE rounded the first turn off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and could only improve her position. HONEYCAMP rated close off the rail the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and weakened. THE MONEY MACHINE raced two deep the opening turn and showed little response through the
backstretch. MARQUET CLASSIC rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn.
LONDON GOLD raced in the five path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened while wide on the far turn.

HURRICANE ALERT pressured the pace while between horses and dueled at even terms from the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in
determinedly to clear Ride The Brand later yards and held off the late arrival of INDICATOR, who engaged in close chase outside, raced three wide on the
turn, dug in from the head of the lane and took second the final yards while gaining on the winner. RIDE THE BRAND bobbled at the break but recovered
enough to contest the pace with a slim early lead, was met at even terms nearing the five sixteenths pole and dueled from that point, raced two deep on the
turn and remained a factor to late stretch before flattening stride. CAFFEINENNICOTINE chased outside, rounded the turn about the four path, left the turn
outside and showed little in the lane. SEA OF TRANQUILITY pressured the early pace inside but steadied in tight at the rail leaving the five sixteenths pole
and flattened stride on the turn. CEDAR RUNS FIBER gave close early chase but steadied between horses nearing the quarter pole and weakened off the
rail on the turn.

Footnotes
SHES SO SPEIGHTSY was bumped leaving the gate then angled to the inside into the first turn, started a bid toward the three eighths pole and steadily
improved to take the lead two deep entering the stretch, dug in from that point and drew off with steady handling. SHERIFF'S KID saved ground off the
pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out from the heels of MISS LAUREN mid-stretch and
dug in to take second later yards. The latter stalked off the rail the first turn, challenged toward the three eighths pole and took a slim lead nearing the
quarter pole, dueled briefly clear but was met entering the stretch and relented second later yards. DORITA'S HEART rated close in the two and three
paths, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path and weakened in the lane. EXPRESS LADY settled in
the three path the opening turn and left the turn mid track, gave chase approaching the three eighths pole, raced in the six path on the far turn and passed
rivals outside. BLUE TWIRLIN raced in the five path the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path
and showed little more. RUN RAEGAN RUN stalked the early pace inside, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the
rail, was bumped leaving the turn and weakened. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY raced in the five path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response
through the backstretch, entered the far turn wide, but weakened off the rail. ALWAYS SOMETHING ducked out and made contact with Shes So Speightsy
leaving the gate then angled to the inside to show the way, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole and contested the edge through the
backstretch, was met nearing the quarter pole and gave way at the rail on the far turn, then angled out and made contact with Run Raegan Run leaving the
turn.
