Footnotes
SOL OF VAQUERO hesitated at the start to give the field two lengths, moved to contention down the backside, circled four wide on the turn to engage the
leaders in a long drive, pulled clear in mid-stretch and held sway to the wire. RAISE YOU ONE reserved off the leaders for the first three-eighths, rallied
while angling five wide at the top of the lane and was gaining belatedly. FORMYBOYS prompted the pace for the first quarter, made a two wide bid to take
command at the quarter pole and was outkicked in the lane. MY TICKET tracked the leaders from three wide down the backside, dropped back on the turn
and finished with some late interest. REDDEN sped off to a clear lead early and weakened turning for home.

OUT ATTHE SPEEDWAY tracked the leaders to midway on the turn, rallied three wide to engage the pacesetter in mid-stretch and wore that one down
inside the sixteenth pole. COWGIRL KIMMIE set a pressured early pace, opened a clear advantage on the bend and kept on willignly while drifting out
through the lane to be second best. GO STELLAIRE settled off the pace down the backside, was called upon in the turn, cut the corner coming for home
and made a mild bid in the lane. LILAC LACE pressed the pace on the backstretch and chased the pacesetter to the wire losing ground late. ROSE RING
broke a step slow to trail and never posed a threat.

Footnotes
CONSTITUTIONALIST broke a tad awkwardly, was quickly gathered together to move up the inside to take the lead, opened a clear lead into the turn,
widened the advantage in upper stretch and drew away easily having never been seriously challenged. CANTHO prompted the pearly pace, chased the
winner through the turn, was no match for that one but finished willingly as second best. C C'S WORLD broke inward bumping rival, stalked the top pair into
the turn and failed to gain ground while finishing best of the rest. JUMP INTO SANITY trailed to the head of the stretch and passed weakened rivals in the
lane. BIG BANG BLUE tracked the leaders and lacked a closing response when called upon on the bend. BEING CREATIVE bumped at the start losing
early ground and was never a factor from there.

PECKS NOT BAD stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied three wide to take command turning for home and drew away as much best down the
lane. EL MARRO pressed the pacesetter into the turn, took a brief lead from two wide and finished willingly while no match for the winner. HOPPY
GILMORE unhurried for the first half mile, angled seven wide splitting rivals in upper stretch and mounted a belated rally. MISTER MOBIL reserved to race
in mid-pack to the top of the stretch and made a mild bid coming home. JOSH'N went evenly. MUTINY well placed tracking the leaders on the turn, angled
in to the rail to loom boldly at the head of the stretch and faded through the lane. ROSCO P. COLTRANE trailed into the turn, made a mild rally while cirlcing
the field to upper stretch and flattened out. UPGRADE AL showed speed for three-eighths and came up empty. TIGER TRAIL failed to menace.

Footnotes
RED COMET stalked the pace down the backside, rallied three wide to the lead in upper stretch, dueled with the runner-up down the lane, lost the lead
inside the final hundred yards and came back again gamely to get the nod on the wire. GOOD MUSIC tracked the leaders to upper stretch, rallied four wide
to engage the leader in mid-stretch, briefly took the lead nearing the wire and lost the bob in a good effort. ANIMO ROBERTO trailed most of the way and
rallied well in the lane to gain the show. SMOOCHER crowded at the start to drop back to trail the field and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. NOSEY
POWER rated in mid-pack and lacked a closing response when called upon. RED HOT POWER set the pace to midway on the final turn and tired. HEIDI'S
SINATRA failed to menace. NO MAS CERVEZA pressed the pace and was through early.

Footnotes
AMY'S STAR pressed the pace into the turn, rallied between rivals on the bend, held position under confident handling waiting to be called upon turning for
home, responded when asked and pulled away as much the best. SWEET MOBILTEE showed early speed to be on the lead into the turn, dropped back
losing position on the bend and re-rallied to gain the place down the lane. SPUNKY ONE unhurried to be at the back of the field, rallied in the stretch to be
gaining late and split the battling closers for the minor awards. MY TWO JAKES tracked the leaders through the turn from four wide and kept on down the
lane while out-finished late. GHOSTLY REVIVAL stalked the leaders to the turn, ranged up three wide to take the lead nearing the quarter pole and
weakened through the drive. HISTORYINTHEMAKING was not a factor.

OUTSPOKEN stalked the pace to midway on the turn, rallied three wide to take control in upper stretch and drew away as much best. DELOVELY prompted
the pace to the head of the lane and kept on willingly to gain the place. FOUR BLESSINGS set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear lead on the
turn and was out-finished in the stretch. LONE RIDGE broke in good order but ducked for the gap several strides from the gate, was gathered together and
trailed the entire trip having lost all chance leaving the gate.
