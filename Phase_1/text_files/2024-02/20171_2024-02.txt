Footnotes
ALWAYS FORWARD stalked the pace racing along the inner rail, swung outside in upper stretch, closed determinedly and took the lead approaching the
finish. DRY HUMOR stalked the pace outside FLITTER, over took that one mid way on the far turn, went clear in upper stretch and gave way grudgingly.
LOOKING FOR WATER , four wide the first turn, remained outside horses down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide and lacked a rally. POLICE
WOMAN lacked speed, swung four wide on the far turn and came up empty in the stretch. FLITTER went clear soon after the break, hugged the inner rail,
lost the lead leaving the far turn and faltered in the drive. OJITOS BELLOS stumbled leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail and was outrun.
DESTINED TO DANCE raced in the two path between horses on the far turn and dropped back through the stretch.

Footnotes
DEVIL PAYS IN GOLD , four wide early, dropped in a bit leaving the far turn and quickly gained three wide to take aim off the dueling leaders, applied more
pressure past the five sixteenths, responded when put to firm asks and kicked clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under encouragement and held
firm. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD , tucked up inside under nudging and had aim off the duel, shifted out three wide under a drive soon into the lane, gave hard
pursuit past mid stretch, flattened out late and narrowly saved the place. BABY SOX , urged along just off the inside and chasing the leaders, angled three
wide nearing the lane, advanced between runners near mid stretch then finished well to the inside of FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD while just missing the place.
SANSA ARIEL , brushed at the break, gave pursuit off the inside, angled five wide for the drive and churned on between foes. ELLIE VICTORINA , off a bit
slow while brushed, lagged back, angled out to be about six wide entering the stretch, straightened and had belated action. LA SAMANA LAURA vied
between runners to the turn, steadied back soon after then stalked, angled four wide approaching the stretch, chased to mid stretch then faded. CORA'S
CHOICE broke outward and brushed with SANSA ARIEL, corrected and dueled inside runners, stayed on to about mid stretch then gave way.
RATIONALMILLENNIAL , brushed at the break, lacked speed, angled five wide and failed to respond. FANCEE GRACE C , unruly pre race behind the gate,
broke outward, corrected and showed speed to contest the pace three deep, dropped in a path then sparred with CORA'S CHOICE leaving the far turn,
failed to kick on from between horses leaving the five sixteenths and tired.

Footnotes
BUCKIN' DREAMER , fractious in the starting gate before the start, prompted the pace outside THE ICE MAN CARLOS, took a short lead into the stretch,
was replaced by CHOCHOCHO in upper stretch, battled back, bumped with that one in upper stretch and got up late. CHOCHOCHO , four wide entering
the turn, circled foes, drifted out in upper stretch when taking a short lead, bumped with the winner when lugging in and hung. I HAD ENOUGH raced in the
two path entering the turn, swung to the four path leaving the bend and failed to rally. LANDSLIDE IS HOME , a forward factor in the three path between
horses leaving the backstretch, angled to the inner rail mid way on the turn and retreated through the stretch. THE ICE MAN CARLOS set the pace along
the inner rail then faltered in upper stretch. BAYTOWN ADMIRAL broke through the starting gate before the race, lacked speed, dropped back and was
eased.

Footnotes
TRUE SUNSHINE , a forward factor in the four path between horses entering the turn, was bumped by FLOGE near the three eighths pole, secured
command in mid stretch and eagerly pulled away. TINA TINA TINA prompted the pace racing in the three path between horses around the turn and in upper
stretch, drifted in near the eighth pole and weakened. FLOGE , five deep into the turn, bumped the winner when drifting in and passed tired horses late.
FAINOR'S FILETS set a pressured pace in the two path between horses around the turn and into the stretch, began to weaken and was steadied in close
quarters near the eighth pole. FUNZALO lacked speed and was never a factor. WAIT FOR TOMORROW , sent into contention down the backstretch,
hugged the inner rail and gave way the final furlong.

start, sped clear early and drafted in to secure the rail into the turn, set a sharp pace, remained clear under a drive leaving mid stretch, could not contain the

Footnotes
SHAFT'S BULLET broke sluggishly, recovered and angled off the inside to advance, took closer order of the dueling leaders while ridden along mid turn,
shifted out and bid four deep into the lane, came in a bit when taking over past the quarter pole, dueled outside MAGIC MICHAEL through the final furlong
and held firm. MAGIC MICHAEL rated close up and to the outside of a rival, bid between runners soon into the lane, battled gamely inside the winner
through the last eighth but was kept at bay. OUTLIER moved up between runners leaving the chute to contest the pace, emerged in a duel to the inside of
COFFEEWITHCHRIS near the five eighths, stayed on while inside a trio soon into the lane, shifted out when not quite quickening with the top pair, kept on
with effort and earned the show. IRISH CORK vied inside a pair of foes early, rated back off the dueling leaders nearing the five eighths, stayed inside past
the three eighths, was under asking into the lane, swung out as the leaders got away past the three sixteenths then churned on. COFFEEWITHCHRIS ,
three deep contesting the early pace, sparred outside OUTLIER into and around the turn, raced three wide and between horses leaving the quarter pole,
kept on with effort past mid stretch then faded. DONTMESAWITHME saved ground off the early pace, angled out under a ride mid turn but failed to
generate a rally. AMERICAN D'ORO bore out at the break, corrected and settled off the pace, was guided about five wide into the stretch, failed to kick on
then weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
GALATIANS stalked the pace racing along the rail down the backstretch, advanced in the two path to wrest command on the far turn, opened up and was
kept to his business in the drive. VIRGINIA FULLA lacked speed, swung to the four path entering the stretch and rallied. STEELE MONEY advanced three
deep mid way on the far turn and weakened through the stretch. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE showed speed near the rail, raced in the two path the far turn and
faded in the stretch run. BRASSTOWN went clear entering the backstretch, set the pace along the inner rail and faltered.
