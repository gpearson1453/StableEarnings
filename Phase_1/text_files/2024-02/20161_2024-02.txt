Footnotes
TWIRLING POINT vied between rivals into the first turn then cleared and moved to the rail, set all the pace to the stretch and remained clear under a drive
through the final furlong. FORMIDABLE MAN raced up close inside a pair of rivals then rated in a stalking position behind the leader, ridden along at the
quarter pole, moved out a bit to make light contact with outer rival in upper stretch, finished willingly through the late stages but had to settle for second best.
RASTAMAN VIBE sat off the pace on the inside, got put in tight and steadied briefly at the three-eighths pole, remained inside and cornered nicely entering
the lane, continued along the fence through the stretch and was along for the show. UNCLE TRULY raced near the back two wide, gained three then four
wide on the second bend and got outkicked for third. MIRACLE MARK stalked in the three path, drew closer three deep on the second bend, was closest in
pursuit entering the stretch but flattened late. NAVY JACK (GB) slipped briefly at the start to come away last, trailed on the inside early, went outside a rival
on the far turn then came three wide into the lane and failed to menace. BANDWAGON stalked two wide, got put in tight and steadied on the first turn then
began to pull, chased two then three wide on the second bend, finished with interest in the stretch but got blocked and took up at the sixteenth pole and was
not persevered with after. OUTGUNNED showed speed three deep then stalked outside a rival in the two path, chased between rivals on the second bend
and tired down the lane.

LA PALOMA BLANCA trailed widest early then into the four path entering the turn, steered down to the inside and launched a rail bid at the quarter pole,
dueled with SOUL SWEET through the stretch and proved best late. SOUL SWEET took control early from inside rivals, showed the way two wide through
the turn, fought outside LA POLOMA BLANCA down the stretch and yielded late. DANCING DANA pressed the pacesetter from outside, chased that rival
past the quarter pole, stayed on through the lane and almost came back to get second. MAJESTIC OOPS chased five deep up the backstretch, rounded the
bend six then five wide, finished willingly in the late stages and whittle the gap. VULIN raced up close four deep to the turn, navigated the bend five then four
wide and gained minor ground late. SPRING SPINNING also raced up close while three deep between rivals, lost ground through the turn, trailed a bit off
the rail into the drive and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT LOVE broke a step slow, chased off the inside and had to take a slight hold when running up behind a rival at the half-mile pole, went two wide
into the turn, angled out and chased four wide into the lane, put in a bid in the final sixteenth and got up near the wire. MR. DREAMCYCLE forwardly placed
outside rivals, bid three deep on the turn, took over in upper stretch, cleared briefly past the eighth pole, tested by MIDNIGHT LOVE in deep stretch and
could not hold that rival at bay. SALSATION stalked on the inside, came under a ride at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane, finished
willingly inside rivals late and gained the show. WINNING BIG away quickly showing early speed then ceded command to RUNNING TIGER, remained
close up two wide into the turn, bid between rivals around the bend, fought to the eighth pole, then failed to kick on with MR. DREAMCYCLE and faltered in
deep stretch. MR. SUDS chased along the rail then shifted and steadied at the half-mile pole, trailed on the rail then two wide around the bend and lacked a
rally. RUNNING TIGER sent for the front and cleared WINNING BIG to set the pace up the backstretch, vied inside a pair of rivals through the turn,
relinquished the lead at the top of the stretch and weakened.

clear with a sixteenth remaining. ASHCROFT dueled for command three deep then outside THEISMANN, battled that rival through the far turn, inched
ahead at the quarter pole, put away that foe at the top of the lane but was immediately tested by YELLOW BRICK, relinquished the lead to the at rival
shortly after and kept on for a clear second. APPRECIATE TODAY stalked three wide into the turn, chased four wide turning for home, could not summon
the needed late kick but stayed on to hold the show. VEGAS BURNER chased out of range then moved closer up the backstretch, took the turn four to five
wide and missed the show. THEISMANN dueled for command from inside, kept the pressure on leaving the bend, yielded at the top of the lane and
weakened. DURAN showed early speed pressing between rivals early then chased the dueling pair up the backstretch, raced along the rail then two wide
into the stretch and weakened. MONGOLIAN ALTAI trailed into the turn, saved ground to the stretch and could not make an impact.

LINDA'S GIFT closest in pursuit from the two path through the early stages, challenged the leader from outside around the far turn, took over late on that
bend, put away inner rival in upper stretch without being asked and drew away under a mild hand urging. QUEENS COMMAND (IRE) broke a bit slow on
the inside, settled off the pace along the rail, moved into range on the backstretch, tipped out with a quarter mile left to run, finished determinedly down the
lane to gain second but could not threaten the winner. KHINJANI (GB) broke a bit slow, tucked inside far off the pace, drew closer in the middle stages,
continued to save ground to the stretch and was along for the show honors. LEISUREWEAR (IRE) tossed her head and broke a step slow then sprinted
clear down the hill, controlled the from inside to the far turn, confronted by LINDA'S GIFT around the bend, relinquished the lead past the quarter pole and
weakened down the lane. MUSICAL RHAPSODY (IRE) stalked the pacesetter from inside, moved out to the two path on the backstretch, entered the lane
three wide and lacked further response. YERWANTHERE (IRE) broke slow on the outside, raced outside a rival at the back early, trailed while saving
ground around the far turn and failed to menace. DUVET DAY (IRE) tracked out of range and moved into the two path, chased three then four wide on the
second bend and weakened in the drive. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) sat off the pace in the two path and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
JUDGE MILLER vied four then three wide around the first turn, fought between rivals on the backstretch, dueled outside HAWKER on the second bend,
disposed of that foe in upper stretch, powered away in the final furlong and was ridden out to the line. HAWKER showed early speed to take the lead and
moved inside while under pressure, vied with outer pair in the middle stages, dueled inside JUDGE MILLER on the far turn, yielded and moved out in upper
stretch and stayed on to hold second. MIDNIGHT MAMMOTH raced up close five then four wide around the clubhouse turn, went up fight three deep for the
lead on the backstretch, failed to kick on with the top pair around the far turn, spun three wide into the lane and churned on for the show honors.
CLOUSEAU bumped leaving the gate then got put in tight between rivals early, chased three deep into the first turn then had to steady around the bend
behind a rival, rounded the far turn three then four wide and weakened. NONE ABOVE THE LAW saved ground through both turns and failed to respond
when called upon. MISCHELOF (CHI) chased in the two path between rivals into the first turn, remained two wide to the stretch and weakened. LOW
EXPECTATIONS bobbled leaving the gate then got crowded shortly after, chased four then three deep on the first turn, four deep up the backstretch,
started to weaken four wide on the second bend, trailed five wide into the stretch, eased and walked off.

CATALINA EDDY stalked three wide into the turn, bid three deep around the bend, battled through the lane and dug in late for the victory. MAN AMONG
MEN chased two wide into the turn, bid between rivals approaching the quarter pole, continued to fight with rivals on both sides through the drive and was
outkicked by the winner. VIRAT took control early then cleared MAN AMONG MEN and crossed over to the inside, pressured by a pair of rivals around the
turn. SANTO DIOS (ARG) stalked from inside, chased behind the leader through the turn, finished willingly along the fence but lacked the needed late
punch. KING APOLLO chased from off the pace, moved into the two path then three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and summoned a mild rally.
GRAZED hit the gate to lose a step at the start, chased four wide into the turn then traveled three deep, tipped out across the dirt and could not find the
needed late kick. NASHOBA'S JOY lagged behind early, trailed three wide into the turn, shifted out to the four path around the bend, angled widest and
failed to menace. DR. SOULFIRE chased in the two path and failed to respond to urging.

upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. DERECHO DANDY bumped with outer rival at the start, dropped back to last then went inside rivals, saved
ground through the turn, tipped off the fence in the lane and closed well for second. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) chased between at the back, navigated
the turn two to three wide, finished well in the final furlong but got outclosed for second. MARS ON FIRE showed brief speed between rivals then chased the
top pair up the backstretch, saved ground and cut the corner into the stretch, moved out and was closest in pursuit with a furlong remaining but finished
evenly late to lose the place and show. BLAME GEORGE tossed his head after leaving the gate to lose a step, sat off the pace outside a rival, took the turn
tow wide, moved out and went between rivals but got bothered a bit midstretch and could not threaten. WORSE READ SANCHEZ bobbled crossing onto

the seven-sixteenths pole, showed the way on the inside then two wide on the turn, drifted out into the lead and gave up command at the top of the lane,
then faded in the final furlong. SHIP AND SCAM chased outside rivals at the back, went four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path around the
bend and could not make an impact. STREET HUMOR chased three deep towards the rear, rounded the bend three wide then came four wide into the drive
and had little left for the stretch run.
