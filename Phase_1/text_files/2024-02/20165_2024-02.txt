REASONED ANALYSIS five paths off the inside down the backstretch in close aim of the duel, tucked three wide into the turn advancing to apply pressure
to the front taking command near the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, drifted out six to seven paths coming under threat to the outside,
then came out two to three paths inside the final sixteenth herding out his main danger and held safe to the finish. CUANDO chased three wide until tucked
inside through the turn, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, tipped out straightened away, drifted out in tandem with the aforementioned foe while
making ground on that rival, then got herded out and carried inside the final sixteenth two to three paths and missed at the end. SARDIS six paths off the
inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and
improved position to secure the show honors. STATES UNITED coaxed from the gate, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, weakened. GET IT TO MATTHEW dueled just off the inside and then along the inside coming under
coaxing near the five-sixteenths when displaced from command, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened. ARMOR OF CATCLAW dueled four
then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths when briefly vying between foes, swung three to four wide for home and faltered.

Footnotes
RIDGEWOOD RUNNER was hustled to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths, spun four wide into upper stretch, dueled gamely inside of the runner-up, drifted out a couple paths late and narrowly prevailed.
IRIDESCENT was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, came five
wide into upper stretch while on even terms for the lead, dueled determinedly outside of the winner into the final sixteenth, was carried out some late and
denied while able to get the place. AUGUSTINE RED settled off the pace, moved closer late on the backstretch, went four then three wide while hard ridden
on the turn, lugged inward while chasing the top two in the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth but missed while just able to get the show. STOLEN
MAGIC was last to commence, raced near the back under urging, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn, pursued the top two in
the stretch, gained into the final sixteenth and also finished willingly but just missed the show. DUNE ROAD settled near the back, moved out around the
five-eighths pole, was roused while five wide on the turn, gained six wide into upper stretch, chased outside while remaining on his inside lead in the drive
and flattened out.

Footnotes
HATCH chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a
challenge through the final furlong and was up in the last jumps to the wire over a pair of foes latched on inside. ANTHRACITE chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick and was up for the place honors in the final
strides between foes. HOT ROD RUMBLE bobbled at the break and was bumped by FACE ABARRIO into CHOCOLATE SHAKE, raced three then two
wide in closest aim of the leader and was given a notch advancing to duel through the latter portion of the turn, took over command and swung four wide
into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under growing threat to the outside and was caught by a pair of rivals in the final
jumps to the finish. MR BOB coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. BAD LARRY coaxed from the gate, chased seven
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper
stretch and weakened. FACE ABARRIO bobbled at the start and recovered inwards bumping HOT ROD RUMBLE into CHOCOLATE SHAKE, cut the pace
just off the inside and then along the inside coming under threat midway on the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, yielded the front near the
quarter pole and took the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. CHOCOLATE SHAKE got bumped at the start and was forced to
steady in behind HOT ROD RUMBLE soon after conceding three lengths to the front, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths,
went eight wide into upper stretch and tired. NECROMANCER chased three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, angled five wide into upper
stretch, trailed throughout.

AIN'T BROKE moved up with six furlongs to run then prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead leaving the backstretch, shook clear in the three then
four path on the turn, responded well when roused five wide into the stretch, came under the crop inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under strong
urging. EVIDENCIAS (BRZ) was void of speed and dropped well back under urging, shifted from the two path to the four path early on the turn and
improved for the place. MOVIE MOXY was coaxed along off the pace, chased four then five wide on the turn, was driven six wide into the stretch, remained
on her inside lead in the drive and weakened then lost the place but was clear for the show. SELF ISOLATION was hustled to the front, showed the way
while well off the inside, moved in late on the backstretch, lost the lead near the seven-sixteenths, dropped back under extra left-rein pressure while in the
two path on the turn and tired. SWEET WILLEMINA was hustled from the gate, chased the early pace on the outside, dropped back with five furlongs to run
then angled in, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to respond. CAIRO SUGAR showed speed under urging then
chased the pace, dropped back near the five-eighths pole, went five wide on the turn and had nothing left. MALIBU MOONSHINE moved up while urged
along, saved ground on the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPS broke fast and went straight to the front, showed the way on the inside of a foe, vied in the two path on the turn, shook clear near
the quarter-pole and drew off under steady urging. AELFGAR pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, lost touch with the winner
into the stretch and proved no match while well clear for the place. BOB JOHN RAY broke in at the start, was hard ridden towards the rear, went around the
turn in the two path, moved out in upper stretch, shifted further out near the sixteenth-pole and improved for the show. BARRON'S BOUNCE was urged
along off the pace, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. SLOW DOWN BIG ANDY was reluctant to load, raced near the middle of the field under
urging, went four wide on the turn and failed to respond. SHORE TIME broke in at the start, angled in under urging early, saved ground early on the turn,
shifted three then four wide starting around the three-eighths pole, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. ALPHA CAT bumped with a rival at the
start then checked, went around the turn in the two path and also failed to threaten. SORORITY PRANK broke through the front of the gate prior to the start
but remained in the stall, was sent hard from the start, climbed while moving out near the five-eighths pole, chased on the outside, went four wide on the
turn and tired. MORTGAGE RATE bumped with a foe at the start, saved ground on the turn and faltered. LANDAUER dropped well behind, went three wide
on the turn and showed little.

late on that bend, rallied outside to make a bid into upper stretch, shook clear into the final furlong and drew away under steady urging. DOC SULLIVAN
bumped hard with a rival at the start, angled out under urging early, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the four
path on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. LIBERTY CENTRAL was taken in
hand early, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three path early on the turn, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and also
proved no match for the winner then just missed the place but was clear for the show. BROWN DON'T STOP bumped hard with foes on both sides at the
start then was squeezed back, settled towards the rear, moved closer with six furlongs to run, shifted from the rail to the three path while roused on the turn
and failed to respond. THE BIG TORPEDO showed the way on the inside of a foe, lost the lead while in the two path early on the turn, dropped to the rail
under urging late on that bend and tired. BALI AMOUR veered in at the start then bumped hard with an opponent, was carried out early, settled at the rear
on the outside, dropped from the four path to the rail early on the turn and had nothing left.
