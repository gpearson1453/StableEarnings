HURRYING HOME , kept in the four path down the backstretch, circled the far turn three wide, secured command at the head of the stretch, was under
urging in the lane and drew off. COMMON PROSPERITY , along the inner rail both turns, eased out in upper stretch and offered a mild, late move.
IMSTILLHERE , steadied in close quarters entering the first turn, swung four wide leaving the far turn and was no factor. HERE COMES RUSTY set the
pace off the inner rail to the stretch then faltered.

Footnotes
HEMP edged up outside rivals into the turn and gained a stalking spot, tracked three deep past the five sixteenths, eased out a bit and moved up to engage
the leaders near the three sixteenths, wrested command soon after, battled outside HELDISH leaving the furlong grounds then kicked away under a solid
drive. HELDISH bobbled slightly at the break, quickly regrouped and was sent up between runners, disputed the pace outside GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) into
and around the turn, gained a slim lead in upper stretch, stayed on to spar inside the winner past the eighth pole, could not quite go with that one near the
sixteenth marker but stayed on gamely to hold down the place. JESTER'S SONG was rated back from between rivals soon after the break, rush up inside
past the five eighths, stalked inside a pair of foes around the turn, steadied briefly behind a runner leaving the three sixteenths, altered out to work between
horses and churned on. PORCH SWING , taken to rate off of contested pace while saving ground, angled four wide into the stretch, made a bit of a move
past mid stretch then flattened out late. GUAPO AGAIN (ARG) set a pressured pace towards the inside, maintained a tenuous lead nearing the stretch,
came out a bit soon into the stretch, stayed willingly to mid stretch then weakened. BLACK ICE , three to five wide, failed to menace. GREAT DAYS AHEAD
, in close attendance three wide early on, stalked between runners around the turn, failed to kick on under pressure leaving the three sixteenths and
weakened. ALIFEROUS , sluggish from the gate, came four to five wide for the drive but lacked a punch.

MIDSUMMERS EVE stumbled leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four deep, closed outside GOLDEN CHAEM and took the lead in deep stretch.
GOLDEN CHARM , four wide on the turn, gained the lead turning for home and finished gamely. MISCHIEF MOTION , swung to the four path leaving the
turn, drifted in near the eighth pole and had a slight rally. VIROLOGIST bumped with LITTLE BABY GIRL about a furlong after the break then steadied in
traffic entering the turn. LITTLE BABY GIRL bumped by VIROLOGIST approaching the five eighths pole, raced along the inner rail into the turn and
weakened. ISLANDINTHESTREAM showed speed along the inner to the stretch then faltered. ASAWER showed speed outside ISLANDINTHESTREAM,

UP AGAINST IT , in the clear saving ground and behind a quartet of chasers leaving the three eighths, swung out five wide for the drive, leveled off to his
best stride under left handed asks leaving mid stretch, forged past the leaders in deep stretch and drew out. COMMANDING GENERAL was sent clear
early, dropped in towards the rail and set the pace, dug in when confronted by CHARGE TO VICTORY leaving the furlong grounds, sparred with that one
leaving the sixteenth marker, was no match for the winner through the final forty yards but dug in gamely to hold the place. CHARGE TO VICTORY chased
the pace two wide between foes, emerged as the closest pursuer past the three sixteenths, ranged up and engaged COMMANDING GENERAL leaving the
eighth pole, fought on past the sixteenth marker then hung late. CAPTAIN CARDO drafted well back off the early pace while saving ground, angled to about
the six path in upper stretch, straightened away and offered a non threatening belated run. CLAW was nudged up early and tracked to the inside of trio of
rivals, had aim while towards the rail in upper stretch, failed to seriously kick on leaving mid stretch then faded. STARSTREET , four deep pursuing the
leader, remained wide for the drive and faded. OUR RONNY ALAN was sent up to a chasing spot soon after the break, was caught three wide between
runners into and around the turn, failed to kick on leaving the three sixteenths and faltered through the final yards.

Footnotes
GABRIEL SEVEN sped to the lead after a rather slow start moved to the inner rail when well clear on the turn, was under urging in the stretch, switched to
his left lead near the eighth pole then took a bit of an awkward step near the sixteenth pole. NEVER GREW UP hugged the inner rail around the turn and
rallied. ERIC'S GIFT , fractious in the starting gate, circled the turn three wide and passed tired foes. MIKE THE BOMB chased the winner from the two path
around the turn and gave way through the stretch. GO TINTIN GO raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. GALACTIC GLORY , steadied in
tight quarters along the inner rail leaving the backstretch, was outrun.

Footnotes
MISTER AGENT relaxed in range while three wide early on, quickly gained and moved two wide between runners to poke a head in front mid turn, emerged
in a head to head battle to the inside of WESLEY THOMAS entering the lane, asserted himself under strong left handed asks in mid stretch then kicked
away while kept to task. WESLEY THOMAS broke outward, corrected and rated a bit early while four wide, responded when let out and rolled up three deep
to challenge mid turn, dueled out the winner past mid stretch, remained on his left lead, kept trying and remained clear of the rest. ASCENDANCE , brushed
at the break, raced off the pace while saving ground, picked up steam and angled out near the quarter pole, came three wide for the drive, advanced
between runners leaving mid stretch and kept on with good energy. FULL PROOF pressed the early pace outside the leader, dropped in entering the turn
then retreated a few lengths while hard ridden, angled out into the lane, found a bit more to edge up leaving mid stretch then flattened out late. KINGDOM
FORCE saved ground early, came off the rail mid turn, entered the stretch four wide but failed to generate a serious run. LITTLE LANCE was hard sent to
shake clear early, set the pace towards the rail, ceded command to the top pair mid turn, failed find more entering the lane and weakened. PACO THE
TACO MAN broke inward and brushed a foe, raced between runners into the turn, moved up a bit five wide nearing the quarter pole then faded. DREAM
RIVER , three wide early, chased two wide past the three eighths then tired.

Footnotes
TAKE A HINT broke sharply then was nudged on to establish command, drafted in towards the rail nearing the turn, handled outside pressure while nicely
rated past the five sixteenths, spurted away after being asked in upper stretch, kept on under strong handling through the final furlong and held firm.
FREEZE THE FIRE chased three deep leaving the far turn, angled out past the five sixteenths, looped five wide outside runners into the stretch,
straightened away and finished well through the final furlong. MR. ANTONELLI , away in good order, forced the pace outside the winner, gave hard chase
through the lane, continued on with good effort and nabbed the show to the inside of a rival. ELLE'SBIGSEACRET showed speed, was steadied back to the
inside of the winner heading to the turn, regrouped and angled three wide with run into the stretch, chased between runners past mid stretch then flattened
out very late. SWIFTY DEVIL broke a bit slow, moved up between runners into the turn, gave chase and offered a mild late response. TAKE CHARGE TOO
, away awkwardly, recovered and edged up outside runners nearing the turn, bid three deep soon after, forced the issue past the five sixteenths then gave
way through the drive.

Footnotes
SAVOY chased the early pace, dropped back a bit mid way on the turn, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, swept to command inside the
eighth pole and drew clear. HE HATE ME , steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, advanced three deep leaving the turn, swung to the five path
in upper stretch, challenged for the lead outside rivals in mid stretch, finished willingly but was not good enough. SHOOT THEMESSENGER saved ground
on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and rallied mildly. RAHMER saved ground on the turn chasing the pace, eased out for the drive, bid for the lead
between horses in mid stretch then weakened. CLASS ACTOR came out leaving the starting gate then briefly chased the pace. BIG HAMBONE , sent to
the early lead, set the pace to the stretch and tired.
