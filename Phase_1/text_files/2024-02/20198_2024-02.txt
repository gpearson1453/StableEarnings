MY BALBOA closed to the front nearing the three eighths pole and rated a slim lead, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn and dug in under
steady handling to hold on. DE'S CASTLE gave chase and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and finished well at
the outside flank of the winner. BEAR'S ESTATE engaged in close chase and raced in range three wide on the turn, ran evenly to late stretch but flattened
nearing the wire. S S MIRAGE gave chase through the backstretch, remained a close factor four wide on the turn but weakened in the lane. J. WICK gave
chase outside and ran evenly in the lane.

GOLDEN APPEAL settled off the rail the first turn, started his bid nearing the three eighths pole and came through the far turn in the three path, dug in for
the lead later yards and ran clear under the wire. ROYAL THUNDER rated the pace inside, was met into the backstretch and dueled with the edge past the
pole, contested even terms at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead past the sixteenth pole and reluctantly ceded later yards. CAYENNE CREEK saved
ground, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and was eased outward on the far turn, left the turn four wide and finished evenly to take third the final
yards. JAMMIN STILL stalked off the rail the first turn, challenged into the backstretch and dueled from that point, contested even terms two deep on the far
turn but weakened the final sixteenth. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled to
the five path rounding the far turn and showed little in the lane.

PLANET FROLIC took an immediate lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole and contested the edge at the rail
on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling and lasted well. BOUNDTOBEOK stalked the pace off the rail, challenged leaving the three eighths pole
and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn, was outfinished for the win but succeeded in the duel for second. QUANTICO CREEK
settled off the rail the opening turn then stalked from the three path leaving the turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, had range on the leaders in
the three path on the far turn but was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. SUMMERTIME ROSE settled inside on the first turn, picked up the chase
toward the three eighths pole, raced in the three path on the far turn and flattened in the lane. CASTLE REVIEW bobbled at the break then saved ground.

DREAMY SONDE gave chase and challenged leaving the five sixteenths pole, contested even terms two deep on the turn, dueled for the nod mid-stretch
and drew clear later yards. MISS BEE BOP chased inside, raced at the rail on the turn, eased out leaving the turn and dug in to take the nod for second
under the wire. SAYYESTOTHELADY was bumped leaving the gate then gave chase outside, raced in the three path on the turn and just missed in the
stretch duel for second. CRAFTY WINDSOR CAT took over while tapering in and rated the early pace, came under pressure from the five sixteenths pole,
contested even terms at the rail on the turn but gave up the lead nearing mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. JUBA BABY ducked out and made
contact with Sayyestothelady then picked up the chase toward the outside, rounded the turn in the four path and could only close the gap in the lane.
