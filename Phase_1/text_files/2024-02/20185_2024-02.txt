Footnotes
LAST SHIFT set the pace in the two path, drew clear around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened while ridden out. ASSERTIVE
ATTITUDE was reluctant to load, chased the winner in the four path, could not keep pace with that foe in the lane but won a long duel for the place.
AWESOME FIRST prompted the pace in the three path, could not keep pace with the winner around the turn, dueled inside of a foe for the place and just
missed. ALBRIGHT was outrun inside. MARVINO played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
KARTANO settled around the first turn to lay off the pace in the three path down the backstretch, came under a ride going into the far turn, angled out to the
seven path in upper stretch, and drew past an inner trio in the final furlong. BACKWOODS BOOGIE prompted the pace in the four path, was under left
handed encouragement rounding the far turn, bid from the six path turning into the lane, narrowly led passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer
foe in the closing stages to place. RED FLAG ALERT showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the three path down the backstretch, was
roused into the far turn, kept on while challenged on both sides and tipping out to the five path at the top of the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong for
show. TEPEU bumped with an outer foe and had to steady at the start, tracked in the two path, was cued into the far turn, bid inside of rivals under a drive
turning into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. SIR TERRE trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but did not
factor. PLUMA ROJA stalked in the five path but weakened in the stretch. OFFICER COUNTRY bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the five
path but was no menace.

Footnotes
BUSY MORNING stalked in the four path, loomed in the three path rounding the far turn, was cued in the four path at the top of the stretch, took the lead
passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. WELL ACTUALLY laid in midpack along the inside down the backstretch, was coaxed from the rail passing the
quarter, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. CHICKEN PARM trailed in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter, fanned
out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. SANDRA D pulled around the first turn to set the pace in the three path down the
backside, waited in the two path around the far turn, was roused turning into the stretch, but weakened in the final furlong. OUTOFNOTHINGATALL rated
inside, was roused midway around the far turn, but finished evenly in the three path down the lane. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM tracked in the four path but
flattened in the stretch. JOEYBIGNOSE raced off the pace in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
CROSS HASTE prompted the pace three wide, took over near the quarter pole and drove clear in the lane. GOLDEN SKULL raced up close at the rail, had
a clear path at the rail through the lane and ran on for the place. SCARAMANGA set the pace along the rail, was collared by the winner near the quarter
pole, tended to drifted out in the stretch and held third. MAJOR KING saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally.
DREAM KNIGHT failed to menace while racing three wide between foes. FORT ATTITUDE was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and came
up empty in the lane. WARLORD CRUZAN was bumped at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. NATURE BOY pressed the pace two wide
between foes and retreated through the lane. FEDERAL EXCHANGE was outrun while racing five wide.

GRIMES bumped between foes at the start, laid in range in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, fanned out to the six path at the top of the stretch,
and rallied outside of foes to get up on the wire. THREE ZERO bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, was roused while
making a bid between foes in the four path at the top of the lane, ran on to lead passing the sixteenth, but was nailed on the wire by an outer foe to place.
WINE EMPIRE stalked inside and kept on for show. FRISSON set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the turn, tipped out to the three path
at the top of the stretch, but evened out in the final furlong. STERLING HARMONY rated in the two path, was coaxed while tipping out to the four path
turning into the lane, but made no impact. DROPKICK MURPHY bumped with an inner foe at the start, tracked in the four path, ranged up to bid in the five
path at the top of the stretch, but hung on his left lead and faded. SERGEANT SINATRA trailed throughout along the inside.

Footnotes
GALIPAN set the pace in the two path, was nudged along around the turn, opened up along the inside into the stretch, and held safely. PARAKEET (IRE)
stalked inside, was roused into the turn, floated out to the six path in upper stretch, then drifted back inwards, and ran on for place. ZAINO trailed in the two
path and kicked on while hanging on his left lead from the three path in the stretch for show. PAISAN tracked in the three path, was cued going into the turn,
but finished evenly in the six path down the stretch. EXCHANGE DREAMS bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated inside, was cued in the three path
midway around the turn fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, but could not factor. PRAISEWORTHY prompted the pace in the three path but
weakened turning into the lane. YASUR bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced wellback in the three path and never threatened, pulled up on the
gallop out and walked off. SOMEWHERE IN TIME broke out at the start, chased in the four path but was no menace.
