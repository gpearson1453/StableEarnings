Footnotes
SUPER ANNIE set the pace in the three to two path around the turn, shook free of an outer presser in upper stretch and inched away. BONITA DIXIE
pressed outside of the eventual winner, bid turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, drifted out subtly while chasing in the final furlong and
held place between horses via a tight photo. AGUILA DEL RIO prompted inside of the leaders early on, chased them around the turn, took aim and vied for
place with outer rivals in the final furlong but missed. FIRST EMERALD leaned out when the gates sprung was quickly corrected but bumped with an inner
rival at the start, tracked in the four path, moved out while taking aim on place in the final furlong, offered a late bid for that position but missed. SPARKLE
IN THE SKY tracked in the two path and chased along the rail through the lane. LOTSA LOU veered out towards empty space at the at the start, then took
back once unable to secure position inside of rivals into the turn, pursued from the inside before shifting out to the four path entering the lane, but failed to
menace. QUEEN MYSTIC bumped with an outer rival at the start and made little impact from the five path. IDA NEEDA DRINK broke slowly, trailed in the
five path and got outrun.

Footnotes
BOLD INTENTION showed the way early on, clung to an advantage from an inner vying rival around the turn, cleared that one at the quarter pole and drew
off. AMERICAN TSUNAMI rushed after a flat-footed beginning to vie for the lead inside of the eventual winner into the turn, but proved no match nearing the
lane and held place. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped two wide entering the lane and stayed on between horses but was
denied reaching place. LOTSA LACE pursued from midpack in the four path and chased evenly. WORK N FLIRT was reluctant to load, trailed in the four
path, swung to the seven path entering the lane and improved mildly. MICKEY DOBBS pursued from midpack in the two path, then chased along the rail
through the lane and lacked a bid. TRICAR MISS chased the top pair from the three path as their closest pursuer into the turn, but faded between horses in
the final furlong. CHARMANT E shifted out to the five path while off of the pace into the turn, fanned to the eight path entering the lane and was outrun. PER
THE HORSE RACING INTEGRITY AND WELFARE UNIT, OLIVIAS CHOICE (IRE) HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

GREASE MISSLE vied for the lead with an inner rival early on, led in the five path around the turn, cleared her inner counterpart nearing the lane, kicked
away in upper stretch, then flopped back to her left lead and lugged in slightly in the final sixteenth. SHE'S MY NIECE vied inside of the eventual winner
while taking the turn in the four path, proved no match nearing the lane and was clearly second best. ZORINA was floated outwardly by an inner rival at the
start, trailed in the six path and moved up late. POP CHART broke outwardly, was urged along off of the pace in the five path and failed to menace between
horses late. BOURBON TIGER chased the top pair from the five path as their closest pursuer around the turn, shifted inwardly cutting the corner entering
the lane, but weakened late. STAY QUIET tracked in the two path and lacked a bid.

MINDSHARE set the pace inside of a prompting rival while a path off of the inner rail and drove clear entering the lane. QUARKY chased the top pair from
the inside, gained place from an outer rival in upper stretch and was second best. HARBOR SKY laid off of the pace in the four path, shifted out to the seven
path in upper stretch and ran on to reach show at the wire. SHARP WARNING pursued off of the pace along the inside, edged show from an outer rival in
the final sixteenth, but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. TIME TO ZOOM pressed the eventual winner, from the three path, but yielded entering the
lane and gave way while subtly drifting out on his left lead. FIGHT ME lacked speed two wide and between horses, and made little impact. LIMITED OFFER
lost his hind footing at the start and broke multiple lengths slow, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
QUALITY RAGS vied for the lead with an outer rival and drove clear in upper stretch. YOU'REINTHEARMYNOW broke a step slow and bumped with an
inner foe at the start, pursued along the inside advancing from midpack into the turn, tipped out to the four path entering the lane and ran on to edge place
in the final sixteenth. ROYAL JOKER dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but yielded in upper stretch and lost place in the late steges.
CALCULATED SPIN laid off of the pace two wide and moved up. BARON'S SONG saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. STREET WHISKEY made
little impact from the three path. KNOCKOUT GUY brushed an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside and failed to factor. MAESTOSO took
light contact from an inner foe, pressed the top pair early on, chased around the turn and weakened. BENNY BUCKETS chased briefly in the four path, but
weakened while drifting out around the turn.

PIPER ROSE laid off of the pace in the four path, took the far turn in the five to six path and rallied to reel in the leader in time. MERINO WOOL settled off of
the pace in the four to five path, gained into and around the far turn to bid outside of the leader at the quarter pole, wrestled an advantage entering the lane,
held into the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder approaching the wire. FAST TO FORTUNE vied two wide and between horses, built a clear
advantage with a half mile to go, met an outer challenge nearing the lane, got headed entering the lane, then fought on gamely. DIRT FLIRT laid off of the
pace in the three path, ran on to close in on the leaders in the final furlong, but was put to hand when encountering traffic late. SHERILINDA stalked in the
three to four path, got outmoved by an outer rival around the far turn and chased between horses. METAROSE vied along the inside, failed to sustain
pressure down the backstretch, yet continued a chase into the lane, but lacked a re-bid. FOLK HERO tracked in the five path but faded entering the
backstretch and was done early. MIDNIGHT FROST vied three wide and weakened with a half mile to go.

Footnotes
HANNAHAZA HETTY prompted two wide, vied around the turn, led at the quarter pole, drifted out hanging on her left lead as an outer rival issued a
challenge in the final furlong, sparred neck-n-neck with that one through the closing stages and narrowly prevailed. AMARETTO DI AMORE tracked in the
four path, sustained a grinding charge in the six path to bid outside of the leader in the final furlong, battled with that one through the late stages but missed.
CAIRO MOON bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path and stayed on to gain show late. ROPERS N WRANGLERS trailed in
the five to seven path and ran on willingly. BANGIE GO bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace inside of a prompting rival, vied with that one
around the turn, got headed nearing the lane, kept on into deep stretch but yielded late. KIRA FEVER chased in the three path and faded. PER RULING
FROM HIWU, AMARETTO DI AMORE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
YOUR RINGER was brushed by an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three path, sustained a grinding charge hanging on his left lead through midstretch,
changed leads while in aim of the leader entering the final sixteenth and drove past late. LUCKY STEPPER broke out and bumped a foe at the start,
pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, entered the lane in the five path and rallied among foes to reach place late. MAMALONA took
contact from an inner rival at the start, showed the way early on, vied with an outer bidder while taking the turn in the two path, drew clear entering the lane,
held sway hanging on her left lead in the final furlong, but was caught by an outer bidder with fifty yards to go and weakened late.
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND tracked in the four path and chased evenly between horses. SHOUT IT OUT pursued from the two path and chased while
one-paced through the lane. LAKER JET bumped with an inner rival early on, pursued from midpack in the six path and failed to menace. COALINGA
HILLS chased forwardly in the five to six path but lacked a bid. JADED TIGER saved ground off of the pace but to no avail. PALACE STAR bumped an
outer rival early on, then made little impact from the six path. SLICE OF PIE simultaneously bumped with rivals on either side early on, stalked outside of
rivals down the backstretch, bid and vied outside of the leader while taking the turn in the three path, but weakened entering the lane in the five path.
ORATORY GLORY leaned out and brushed a rival while breaking slow, trailed along the inside into the turn and never got involved. DANIELLE'S SECRET
lacked speed in the three path and between horses but faded entering the turn.
