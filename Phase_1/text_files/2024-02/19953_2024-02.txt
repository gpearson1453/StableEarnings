Footnotes
EVIE'S ENCORE broke back, unhurried early inside, bit closer along the rail turning for home, steered out to be three wide for room nearing the furlong
marker, split foes and challenged three wide, drew well clear under a firm hand ride. SHE'S TABOO forwardly placed behind the first flight inside, came in
the two path for the drive, moved out wider for the drive, challenged with the winner outside that one past the furlong marker, proved no match late, held
sway for the place. UNION DAME pressed the issue up front early, vied between horses through the turn, weakened a bit the final furlongs, saved the show.
HOORAY FOR CREDIT broke on top, set or forced the pace along the inside, weakened the final furlong. MONEY IS TIME off a step slow, trailed early,
picked off a couple of tiring rivals late while never a threat. FASHION IDOL raced off the pace and the inside, three wide into the stretch, failed to produce a
rally. DANCE MY WAY pressed the issue early outside, vied three wide and held a narrow advantage by late in the bend, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
GI GIS MAP broke on top, showed the way into the first turn just off the inside, dropped to the rail, rated in the run up the backstretch, let out a notch into the
lane, stayed clear to the wire while being kept to task. MIWOMAN last away, lacked speed while three wide into the far turn, dropped to the inside by late in
that bend, rallied up the inside to be clearly second best, not a serious threat to the winner. SPITE LITE settled off the pace while saving ground, continued
inside the middle half, angled three wide turning for home, lodged a mild and brief bid for the place, outkicked by the runner up to the wire the final furlong,
finished up best of the rest. CRY IF I WANT TO forwardly placed inside, chased the winner into the lane just off the inside, had little left for the stretch run.
BUMP IN THE NIGHT in the second flight three wide, had little for the drive. DIXIE RAG made little impact while racing off the inside. BABE IN THE
WOODS chased the winner for five furlongs, asked along far turn, managed little in the way of a response, faded down the stretch. CALIFORNIA CODE
gave way after a half, fell far back, distanced after losing contact with the field in the stretch, jogged in. DE DE'S BIRD fell far back, sluggish, pulled up
second turn, vanned off.

top two when in a bit tight, continued to weaken to be caught for the show. BE MY HUCKLEBERRY lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground turn,
made a late run up the inside to improve position. DIXIE GIRL TO lacked early speed, four to six wide exiting the turn, improved position a bit while
remaining well out in the strip. PAT'S GAL one paced off the inside, came four wide for the drive, lacked a significant closing response. COURAGEOUS

Footnotes
TIM TAL in the second flight early inside, moved out off the rail turning for home, angled back down to the inside, finished willingly up the rail to be in time.
LUNDBERG pressed early three wide, took over from the outside turn, clear past the furlong marker, nailed at the wire. FUNNY UNCLE broke back, moved
out three wide when beginning to advance midway on the turn, continued with good determination to take down the show late. RED LINE OVERDRIVE last
to leave, raced back and inside, moved out in some traffic turning for home, advanced to race closest to the top pair past the furlong maker, weakened late
to lose the show. SHUFFLE DANCE in the second flight while racing in the two path, had little for the drive. WESTERN GHENT broke alertly set the pace off
the rail, gave way when headed by the runner up when headed in the turn. FAN THE FIRE finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
THIRD WATCH off a step slow, raced back and toward the inside, moved closer in some traffic late in the turn, moved out, challenged between horses
nbearng the furlong marker and drove well clear. PREACHER'S KID in mid pack while racing inside, advanced and got through along the rail into the lane,
bid a furlong out, could not match strides with the winner late, held sway for the place. SIR PEEL within striking distance off the inside, moved out,
challenged on the outside turning for home, vied past the furlong marker, weakened a bid was well well clear of the others. DARIO in mid pack, advanced
just off the inside into the stretch, steered to the outside when straightened for home, failed to fire. OUR HEAVENLY GIFT forwardly placed well out in the
strip, steered out a bit more to be four wide into the lane, managed a minor rally improve, not a real threat. SCOTT CITY restless gate, chased the early
leader, challenged that one from the outside turn, gained the advantage, narrowly showed the way past the furlong marker then faltered to lose several
positions. BERRYVILLE BULLET lacked early foot out in the strip, four wide into the turn, angled in through the turn to be in the two path entering the
stretch, improved position slightly without posing a serious threat. PREPAREDNESS fractious in the gate, off step slow, void of speed, moved out three
wide, passed tiring rivals. STAUF restless in the gate, off slowly, also improved by passing foes. IMA FUN GUY broke sharp, set the early pace while
angling inside, dueled turn, gave way in the drive. TOMMY TRI mid pack early, began a steady fade before a half. MR SEEKER tired while racing four wide.

Footnotes
EQUILOVE (IRE) broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch in hand and along the rail, continued to rate through the turn, stayed clear through the
stretch under steady handling. DISTORTED SECRETS forwardly placed off the inside, chased the winner into the stretch in the two path, getting to that one
late with some good energy. ARTISTIC VISION settled off the pace and the inside, dropped to the rail late in the turn, chased the top two past the furlong
marker, proved no match for that pair, held the show. NEVERSAYNOLETSGO off a step slow, steered out to be four to five wide into the stretch, improved
down the middle of the strip. COST A FORTUNE broke back, lacked speed, four wide when making a mild advance into the stretch, flattened out the final
furlong to finish up evenly. SHANIAH went one paced while three wide in lacking a closing response. MISS DISTINCTIVE forwardly placed while racing
along the inside, two path into the stretch, tired. MISS WINDY SLEW chased the winner off the inside, dropped to the inside when beginning to tire late in
the turn, continued to weaken. EVERYOTHERWON finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
LUNA MOTH stalked the pace from along the inside, came in the two path for the drive, moved out wider past the furlong marker when roused, kicked down
the leader late to be in time. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE unhurried early after breaking slowly, made a nice move four wide into contention through the second
turn, outside bid into the lane, gained the advantage, shook clear, nailed in the final strides. C. C. HARBOR off a step slow, trailed well back for six furlongs,
began to rally midway on the final turn, finished up willingly to be up in time for the show. THESTRAL settled in the second flight early off the inside, closer
three wide before a half, challenged through the second turn and into the lane, weakened from between horses the final furlong. HIGHLY CREATIVE away
in good order, sprinted clear to set the pace along the inside, weakened into the stretch, continued to fade in the run to the wire. ROYAL LAUGHTER void of
early foot, moved closer in the four path in the second turn, failed to sustain that advance through the stretch. SICILIAN GRANDMA in the second flight
while racing off the inside, gave way in the far turn. DELPHIA broke on top, closest to the early leader, joined that one from the outside and dueled
backstretch, stopped far turn, jogged in.

Footnotes
CONNIE K broke alertly, dueled up the backstretch closest to the inside, headed turn, regained late in the turn, shook clear a furlong out, held the next two
safe late under firm handling. KABOOM BABY raced in the second flight just off the inside, chased the winner past the furlong marker while still in the two
path, slowly gaining late. HAMAZING DEBATE last to leave, lacked speed inside, advanced up the rail stretch, in a bit tight at the end, missed the place
while narrowly gaining the show. SULWE in mid pack while outside, ranged up into contention four wide late in the bend, lost some ground to the winner into
the lane, flattened out and lost the show late. HOT SPRINGS BLING behind the pace while toward the inside, lacked a significant closing response through
the lane. HISSY MISSY forwardly placed while three wide for a half, faltered in the drive. UNBRIDLED TWISTER back off the pace, three to four wide
through the turn, lacked closing kick. TOO PRETTY dueled up front in the two path, gave way into the stretch. GRAMERCY PARK in mid pack while three
wide into the turn, backed up steadily through the stretch.

ONE MORE KELLY dueled up front closest to the inside, shook clear midway on the final turn, extended that advantage through upper stretch then
maintained a comfortable advantage the final furlong under a hand ride to win ridden out. STOIC LUNA settled off the pace while also along the inside,
continued to save ground through the second turn when making a modest advance, chased the winner through the length of the stretch, no match for that
one, clearly second best. INTO DISCO chased the dueling leaders off the inside, bit closer three wide late final turn, allowed the runner up the inside into the
lane, offered little resistance to that one, best of the rest. DEMI hesitated at the break, trailed early, four wide through the second turn,went evenly through
the stretch. WINDY BAY broke on top, alternated up front for almost six furlongs outside the winner, first to blink, backed up stretch. LOVER GIRL finished
early, far back.

Footnotes
ADIVA within striking distance off the inside, moved on the winner in hand and challenged between horses late in the turn, drew steadily clear under
pressure. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN in the second flight outside, four wide into the turn, challenged three wide and outside the winner late in the bend, could
not keep up with that one in the drive, remained clear for the place. CREDITOR broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, offered little resistance to the top
pair in the drive, comfortably saved the show. NATURAL TOUCH behind the pace toward the inside early, swung out four wide turning for home, lacked a
closing kick. MISS DOUBLE lacked speed, came five wide out of the turn, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. CHOCTAW BLESSINGS
chased the early leader along the inside, began a steady retreat before a half. BABAS GAL off a step slow, well back inside, picked off some tiring rivals
while remaining inside while never a serious factor. COWGIRL CAMILLE hesitated at the start then broke in, remained always back. PINK CHIMES raced in
mid pack along the inside for a half, faded through the stretch. EXHI LIL DARLIN in the second flight inside the runner up into the turn four wide, three wide
exiting the bend, gave way.
