Footnotes
STRINGS broke alertly, dueled up front backstretch and into the turn, disposed of that foe just as the runner up joined the fray three wide midway on the
turn, dueled with that one in upper stretch and past the furlong marker, found more to drive clear late. JOE FRAZIER last to leave, moved up after the start
to a forward position into the turn, challenged three wide approaching the half mile mark, raced on equal terms with the winner through upper stretch, could
not match strides with that one late, held sway for the place. HOLDING PATTERN broke back, lacked speed along the inside, steered out to be four wide
when beginning to advance late in the turn, slowly getting to the runner up late while out in the strip. MARVELOUS THUNDER away in good order, dueled
up front along the inside, weakened in the drive. RISK PROFILE void of speed, made little impact while racing three wide. ALVAARO in the second flight
along the inside for four furlongs, backed up in the drive. ROSIE'S BOY finished early, well back.

Footnotes
J J'S JOKER away well, fell back behind the pace early, closer three wide late in the turn, challenged on the outside into the stretch, wore the early leader
down while fully extended. SOUND DOCTRINE dueled up front early closest to the inside, shook clear of that rival by midway on the turn to get a bit of a
breather, responded when the winner came alongside exiting the bend, proved stubborn to the end. WE MISS ARLINGTON forwardly placed along the
inside, remained within striking distance turning for home, could do little with the top two to the wire, remained clear of the others. WESTERN GHENT
dueled up front early inside the runner up, chased that one into the turn, began to weaken by late in the bend when headed by the advancing winner. PASS
LINE went one paced throughout while racing three wide. POWER SLAM broke in then was a bit erratic in the early going, not a threat. SEAS OF
NORMANDY off a step slow, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LILMS CONSTITUTION off a bit slow, raced back and along the inside, steered out three wide turning for home, finished with good energy to kicked down
the leader. WAMPUS KITTEN forwardly placed outside, vied up front three wide into the turn, chased through the bend, rebid then shook clear past the
furlong marker, could not contain the winner, well clear for the place. DELACINA moved outside after the start, four wide through most of the turn when
moving closer, drifted in stretch and flattened out to finish up evenly. SHE'S NOT A JOKE in the second flight while racing off the inside, two path through
the turn, lacked a closing kick in the drive. FOXY ZORRA fell back to trail after the start, well wide backstretch, four out to six wide through the turn,
improved position slightly while never a threat. QUEEN OF SALSA lacked speed outside, four to five wide turning for home, failed to menace. WEST
COAST HARBOR broke back, moved up steadily the opening quarter to take control into the turn, briefly clear, faltered in the drive. TEXAS HOTTIE broke
sharp, flashed brief speed in the two path, stopped.

Footnotes
MONEY RUN moved up after the start to take control, extended that advantage through the turn and upper stretch, held the runner up comfortably at bay in
the late going while under steady handling. SPEIGHT AND MALICE settled off the pace and the inside, raced three wide through the turn, steadily getting to
the winner with a rally down the lane, well clear of the others. GOOD SCOUT behind the pace inside, continued to save ground through the turn, slipped
through along the inside turning into the stretch, lacked a closing response to finish up best of the rest. W W CRAZY last to leave, trailed inside, steered out
to be three wide for the drive, improved position with some mild interest while widest in the drive. LIGHTNING STRUCK went one paced throughout in the
two path to lack a closing bid. DEFLATER chased the winner off the inside for a half and began to give way. KOWBOYKABIN remained back while racing
three wide much of the way. DRILL'S LI'L MAN finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
H. T. XENA lacked early foot, crept a bit closer in the turn while in the two path, came three wide for the drive, closed with a rush to be in time. DIVA TREVA
broke sharp, showed the way up the backstretch off the inside, got out a bit to be three wide turning for home, remained well clear past the furlong, caved in
late, saved the place. ESSENTIAL BUSINESS back off the pace while well wide up the backstretch, continued four wide through the turn, finished willingly
late while left with too much to do. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN forwardly placed inside, continued in a striking position turning for home, lacked a closing punch.
HALAGA back off the pace along the inside, continued to save ground turn, steered out a bit for the drive, finished up evenly in also lacking a closing kick.
SHE DAZZLE chased the runner up in the three path, weakened in the drive. TRIPLE L'S CUTTER void of early foot, three wide into the stretch, improved
slightly without posing a serious threat. SIMONA'S CHOICE settled off the pace and the inside, three to four wide exiting the turn, had little left for the run to
the wire. ALSANAH remained back while saving ground to no avail. LA V. tired while racing three wide.

contain the top two the final furlong, saved the show. PINELAND slipped at the start to be away slowly, was used up the inside, within striking distance, went
evenly through the lane in lacking a late punch. MILLERS RITE fell back to trail after the start, angled four wide into the lane, improved with some mild late
interest. MUSICAL MAESTRO pressed the issue in the two path, faltered in the drive. MEMPHIS PHAROAH restless gate, reloaded, broke slowly and into
the gap, rank into the turn, saved ground, no threat stretch. TRUE FAITH in mid pack well off the inside, four wide through the turn, tired in the drive.

Footnotes
BETTYS CASH with the pace in the two path, showed the way through the turn, headed into the lane and past the furlong marker, battled back in game
fashion to narrowly gain the edge at the wire. MACHO ROCCO forwardly placed three wide, advanced and challenged on the outside into the stretch,
gained the advantage, outkicked in the late going to miss. BLAME J D in mid pack while racing off the inside, came in the two path for the drive, could do
little with the top two the final furlong, narrowly gained the nod for the show. ONE TEN STADIUM fell back to trail soon after the start, continued back early
turn, swung out five wide into the lane, rallied down the middle of the strip in finding his best stride too late. CITRUS BAY fractious in the gate, reloaded to
break with the field, saved ground turn, moved out nearing the furlong marker, flattened out. HESS off a step slow, four to five wide turn, one paced in
lacking a closing response. MACHO RONNIE vied up front along the inside for a half and then weakened in the drive. ALLO ENRY off the pace toward the
inside, in traffic early turn, continued in the two path, traffic again a furlong out, no kick. REEF'S DESTINY remained back while racing two to three wide.
TABLE MONEY within striking distance outside, four wide into the lane, faded down the lane.

Footnotes
NINJA WARRIOR away in good order, dueled through a quick opening quarter off the inside, vied between horses into the lane after an equally glib half
mile, long drive to the wire, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. PAYNE last away, saved ground through the turn while still well back, eased out
a bit for room nearing the furlong marker, closed well to miss while closest to the rail of the first flight. EDGE TO EDGE broke sharp, prompted the duel from
the outside into and through the turn, four wide bid when straightened for home, long drive to the wire, not enough late. MACRON broke with leaders,
dueled through those quick fractions closest to the inside, continued to do battle through upper stretch, first to blink past the furlong marker.
KNEEDEEPINSNOW went one paced along the inside, lacked a closing punch. C Z ROCKET settled in mid pack and off the inside, three wide through the
turn, lacked the needed closing response through the stretch. ACCIDENTAL HERO fell back to trail after the start, four wide into the stretch, picked off a
couple of tiring rivals while failing to rally. DERBY DATE moved closer while three wide through the turn, backed up in the drive. SPANKSTER tired while
four wide out of the turn.

Footnotes
DIDJA broke alertly, dueled up front off the inside, shook off the other speed and a pair of rivals turning into the stretch, stayed clear to the wire. TIME
ANDBEYOND back off the early just off the inside, loomed a threat four wide turning for home, proved no match for the winner in the run to the wire, lasted
for part of the place. TASK early bump, raced back, four wide through the turn when making a mild advance, continued to rally through the lane and was up
late for the dead heat for second. PATTON'S TIZZY within striking distance outside, moved a bit closer three wide late in the turn, lacked a further advance
and flattened out in the drive. SECRET STRATEGY void of early foot, continued to lag early turn, came four wide for the drive, rallied belatedly to improve
position. BERABERABERA in mid pack early inside, shifted out to the three to four path late in the turn, went evenly through the stretch. BET ALL THE
GOLD dueled up front along the inside, gave way in the drive. HAYAHLOOKATME broke back and failed to menace. STRIKE RIDGE in the second flight in
the two path, in some traffic late in the turn, gave way in the drive. TURQUOISE BLUE remained back in failing to threaten. WELCOMETOARKANSAS
forwardly placed along the inside to lose position, continued to back up through the lane. BO NUGGET pinched then took up soon after the start, trailed
throughout.
