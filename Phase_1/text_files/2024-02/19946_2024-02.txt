Footnotes
NEXT ON STAGE broke very fast and showed clear early, tossed her head a bit while taken in hand, set the pace with some company on her flank to the
outside, inched clear while inside to the two path on the turn, responded well when asked near the quarter-pole, drew off under the crop until outside the
sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the finish while much the best. CELESTIAL EXPRESS broke out at the start, settled on the far outside,
moved closer late on the backstretch, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased the winner under the crop into upper stretch and proved no match
while clear for the place. NATURAL FACT was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, raced in hand while off the pace, moved closer near the
nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, was roused outside the three-eighths pole and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. AUTUMN'S
TURN settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the three path, came six wide into upper stretch and failed to
threaten. BROWN AS A BISCUIT broke out at the start, stalked the winner on the outside, was asked leaving the backstretch, chased in the three path on
the turn, dropped back under strong urging late on that bend and came up empty. EXTRA DIRTY was taken up when the rider fell back in the saddle at the
start, moved up to establish a good position just off the pace while in hand, was urged along in the two path for most of the turn, shifted three then four wide
over heels late on that bend and had nothing left. MAGGIE'S SONG was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, moved out early then settled towards
the rear, dropped in near the five-eighths pole, shifted back out under urging late on the backstretch, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
PRINTRACK coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of CHUCK WILLIS remaining patiently handled through to spinning just off the inside into upper stretch,
got set down straightened away, drew off under a drive to prevail. BEACHWALKER grew detached at the tail of the field early on when devoid of speed,
chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, rallied with a mild kick to secure the place
honors clear of the rest. CHUCK WILLIS (IRE) hustled from the gate, dueled two then three wide with PRINTRACK to his inside, came under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, had the rider lose the handle on the crop to left side when extracting it for the initial time just outside the
eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages while clear for the show honors. VICTORIOUS WAVE coaxed from the start, chased just off the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened. POPPY'S PRIDE coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under a
ride from three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the drive. SUNRISE JOURNEY coaxed from the start, chased four wide
under encouragement from just outside the five-sixteenths, angled six wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
AULA went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way on the inside of a foe, raced inside on the far turn, was asked near the
three-eighths pole, shook clear inside the three-sixteenths, remained clear under the crop into the final sixteenth and just held under strong urging.
MIDNIGHT TROUBLE was hustled from the gate then taken under a hold early, raced inside to the two path under stout restraint on the first turn, was rated
just off the pace, drafted inside while behind horses on the far turn, moved to the two path while roused late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch
under the crop, pursued the winner into the final furlong, gained into the final sixteenth and just missed while clear for the place. PORTOS was hustled from
the gate, saved ground on the first turn, settled under some urging, was ridden along while inside on the far turn, remained along the rail in the stretch and
willingly earned the show. WINNING CONNECTION prompted the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was asked on the far turn, dropped back in
upper stretch and tired. UNION LIGHTS went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was roused with a half-mile to run, went three wide on the far
turn and came up empty. BOSSMAKINBOSSMOVES rounded the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was urged along passing the
nine-sixteenths, went three then four wide on the far turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
RIBOT'S VALENTINE coaxed from the gate, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before briefly tucking three wide near the turn, tucked to the
two path through the turn, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths and tipped out three wide inside that station, advanced and swung four then three
wide into upper stretch seizing command straightened away, came inwards at the three-sixteenths placing BERN ROSEY BERN briefly in tight along the rail
before edging away under a drive kept to task to the finish. FANCY FELINE got bumped at the start by TRY IT AGAIN, who broke inwards, crossed directly
to chase along the inside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick to secure the place
honors. BERN ROSEY BERN coaxed from the gate, dueled three wide down the backstretch with ROJA LIGERA to her outside, tucked inside through the
turn and was coaxed along inside the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got displaced from command straightened away and then
carried in lightly and briefly to be in tight along the rail at the three-sixteenths, tipped out a furlong out and kept on to chase the winner home while safe for
the show honors. TRY IT AGAIN broke in at the start bumping FANCY FELINE, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before briefly tucking three
wide, came under coaxing now just off the inside at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch and was one paced through to the finish.
LOCKBOX coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide, came under coaxing along the inside at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five wide into upper
stretch and weakened. ROJA LIGERA dueled four then two wide with BERN ROSEY BERN to her inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung
four wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
UNCLE MARTY went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was roused while moving from the rail to the two path late on the far turn,
rallied under the crop in the final furlong and closed well to get up late and prevail. HORSE BE WITH YOU had early speed, saved ground on the first turn,
showed the way with a clear advantage, was asked under threat while in the two path on the far turn, repelled CLEVER FOREVER outside the furlong
marker, held a clear advantage under the crop into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. CLEVER FOREVER bumped with a foe at
the start, raced in the three path on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path midway through the far turn, lost touch with
the runner-up into the final furlong and tired while just able to get the show. NOBLE HUNTSMAN saved ground on the first turn, settled towards the back,
was urged along in the two path for most of the far turn, shifted three then four wide later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response then just missed the show. REFUAH bumped with foes on both sides at the start, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the first
turn, settled off the pace, saved ground while roused on the far turn and failed to respond. SUPREME BEING lost his footing at the start but broke with the
field, went two then three wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged four then five wide on the far turn and also failed to respond.

under a drive issuing a challenge through the final furlong, seized command near the sixteenth pole, then edged away to the finish kept busy to the end.
BRONX BOMBER showed the way in hand three then two wide, got set down spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was
collared near the sixteenth marker, ran on to preserve the place honors. BUSTIN SHOUT chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, improved position to procure the show honors. SIX PERCENT chased four wide under coaxing from
the three-eighths, angled six to seven wide at the top of the stretch, kept on one paced through to the finish. BREAKING STONES coaxed from the start,
chased three to four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, continued three to four wide for home, weakened in the late stages. WARRIORS
REVENGE got bumped at the start by HORN OF PLENTY, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cut the corner into upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. HORN OF PLENTY bobbled at the break and bumped WARRIORS REVENGE, chased briefly inside and was off
the heels of that rival before tipping to the two path, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered two to three wide at the head of the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY JOKER was ridden along off the pace, dropped to the rail early on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was guided out outside the
eighth-pole, rallied outside in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final stride. VODKA MARDINI was hustled to the front, set the pace under
pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, inched clear coming to the quarter-pole, responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper
stretch, switched to a left-handed crop near the furlong marker, led until the final stride but was denied. M B'S MUNNING was hustled from the gate,
pressed the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the turn, chased the winner while between horses in the stretch and kept on to willingly earn
the show. UNCLE GEORGE rushed the front of the gate and broke open the stall doors before the rest of the opponents doors started to open, had the
doors open completely at the same time as the other foes but was off slow, moved up on the outside, chased three wide on the turn, turned into the stretch
under the crop, pursued the winner outside of two foes while remaining on his inside lead until inside the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead at that
point and lacked the needed kick. RETURN THE RING was urged along towards the front, chased inside on the turn, pursued the winner while inside of two
foes in the stretch and also lacked the needed kick. PINE VALLEY was urged along off the pace, traveled three wide on the turn, moved out in upper stretch
and lacked the needed response. NATURAL HARBOR became fractious in the gate when a neighboring broke through the front, broke through the gate
himself, had the neighboring foe thrash about near his legs. was deemed fit to run by the state veterinarian, came away from the gate under urging, steadied
in tight against the rail early, was urged along at the back, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and gained
some while failing to threaten.

Footnotes
LEELOO stumbled at the start recovering inwards and bumping TAMING THE TIGRESS, vied five then four wide down the backstretch with a pair of rivals
to her inside, tucked three then two wide dueling with PROUD FOOT from the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, seized sole command
when roused at the three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. PROUD FOOT vied three wide between foes down the backstretch, shook off
the inner rival of the trio in concert with the aforementioned foe at the seven-sixteenths and dueled tucked to the inside through the rest of the turn coming
under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and ran on to chase the winner
home clear for the place honors. PORTAGE brushed the off side stall at the start, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping two then
three wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to the wire. TAMING
THE TIGRESS got bumped at the start by LEELOO who recovered inwards from a stumble, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CRYPTO MAMA hustled from the gate, vied from the two path inside a
pair down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home, got shaken off at the seven-sixteenths and chased along the inside through the turn,
cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
COLLECTED SPECIAL was away alertly and went straight to the front, angled in early then showed the way with a clear advantage, controlled the action
while inside on the turn, responded well under increased hand-urging in upper stretch while remaining on his inside lead, was given one pop of a
right-handed crop near the furlong marker, swapped to the proper lead shortly thereafter and held under a hand-ride to the finish. THE DELAWARE BOYZ
tracked the pace, moved outside the leader near the five-eighths pole, chased in the two path on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final
furlong and proved no match while well clear for the place. DIANNESRETIRING bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the inside of a foe,
went four wide on the turn and narrowly earned the show. ARCO AUGUSTA broke out at the start, was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide on the
turn, remained on his inside lead in the stretch and was no factor. RORY'S ORCHARD bumped with an opponent at the start, was urged along on the
outside, went five wide on the turn and failed to respond. GO GRAD settled off the pace, was urged along late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn,
turned into upper stretch in the two path while under the crop and failed to threaten.
