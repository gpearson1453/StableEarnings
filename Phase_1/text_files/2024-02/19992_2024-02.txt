Footnotes
GOLDEN STAR pressed two path, race well clear into the upper stretch and held clear under a steady hand ride. VIENNA'S TWIRL vied for the early lead
near the rail but was no match for the winner in the drive. AUNT JO chased the top trio, was near the rail past the three sixteenths pole, shifted out four
deep and raced even in the drive. MAKAAN hustled while saving ground throughout and had not enough. CABIN ABBY chased the pace from the inside
and weakened. STORMIN' ANNA hustled along, raced three wide around the far turn and lacked a bid. PURPLE CALLA was off slowly, raced five wide
around the far turn and never threatened. ZIDORMI raced two to three wide and had no response.

TOP OF THE MINT rated along early, made a four wide bid near the three sixteenths pole and edged clear in strong effort under steady handling. PYEONG
CHANG pressed the early pace, dug in between and finished gamely to the wire. NEPOTISM pressed the early pace between rivals and weakened in the
latter stages. CURLIN'S THRILL raced two to three wide and had no late rally. URBAN BANDIT was allowed to settle early, raced three wide around the far
turn and lacked a bid. GAMMA SQUEEZE showed good early foot along the inside and tired readily.

COWBOY AT HEART vied for the early lead from the outside of foes, raced well clear and proved best under steady pressure. JIMMY THE KID chased the
top trio and finished well to rally well for the place position. HELMS DEEP dropped back to race mid pack under strong pressure, had an inside run and
moved up late. SETTLEMENT DATE hustled along, fanned wide into the upper lane and made a late gain. JAZZ MAN DO pressed the early leader and
faded in the drive. JUBAY was coaxed along, raced four deep around the far turn and faded. MOGALU was void of speed, saved ground and never
threatened.
