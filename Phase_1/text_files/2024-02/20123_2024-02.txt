Footnotes
ADIEU ACES vied for the early lead, took command around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. SKIPPA raced within striking distance, made a late
bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. SILKY'S DANCE pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, made a bid, racing four
wide and proved no match for the top two. CUSTOM PRAYER broke sharp, went to the front, saved ground around the turn, lacked a late kick and was
outfinished for third. SUNSET WAR showed early speed, faded and finished evenly. CLASSIC RED RACER void of early speed and was never a factor.
THUNDERTAKESDALEAD lacked early speed and was never close.

NEED SOME MONEY pressed the pace, racing five wide around the first turn, moved up around the second turn, took command, drove clear and was kept
to the task. SIMPLE PLEASURE raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the second turn, proved no match for the winner, but was
best of others. CAJUN ACES raced near the back in the beginning, came around the first turn six wide, made a steady gain and proved no match for the top
two. SHE'SMYSMOKESHOW showed early speed, briefly took the advantage, while saving ground and weakened down the stretch. CHEROKEE
SUMMER lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. MSCHITCHATTOUR void of early speed, made a mild gain, but was no threat. MARDI
GRAS ALARM dueled on the front end and dropped back. NORA'S LEGACY challenged for the early lead and made a steady retreat. LACIS JEWEL
always raced near the back and showed little. LADY ENVOY flashed brief speed, dropped back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

within striking distance, came around the turn on the inside, checked down the stretch, angled out and finished willingly. MALADJUSTED MISFIT dueled on
the front end, forwardly placed throughout and weakened. THE PETITIONER raced near the back in the beginning, made a steady gain, angled in down the
stretch, lacked running room and was outfinished for third. CUSTOM STAR vied for the early advantage and faded. I NITA WARRIOR lacked early speed,
came around the turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. POUND OUT A DEAL raced near the middle of the field, faded and was no threat.
ROCKING TOBE raced evenly near the back and showed little. TIZNOW TOM always raced near the back and was outrun. BOLD AND BRASH raced

RING TWICE pressed the pace, moved up around the final turn, took the lead entering the home stretch, pulled away and proved the best. SPANISH
DELIGHT went to the front, saved ground, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. INAWIC raced within striking distance, made a mild bid
and proved no match for the top two. OOCHIE lacked early speed and was never a factor. SUMMERTIME BANDIT raced within contention, saved ground
around the final turn and faded. RUN NATALIE RUN always raced near the back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire. BATTLE OF WITS
raced in the back, was pulled up around the first turn and walked off.

START WELL unhurried in the early going, made a steady gain, rallied down the home stretch on the rail and got up in time. SARA'S SAPPHIRE raced
within contention, saved ground around the turn, angled out down the lane and was outfinished for the win. LIKE FINE WINE raced within striking distance,
made a bid four wide and proved no match for the top two. BATTY lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. PINTLALA raced in the
middle of the field, had a wide trip and put forth an even effort. DEBBIES PASSAGE sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. SWEET BAY pressed the
early pace and was finished early. AMERICAN REALITY void of early speed and was never close.

HALF CRAZY broke in, pressed the pace, moved up around the second turn, drove clear down the lane and held on well for the win. VESTMENT raced in
the middle of the field, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a late rally and was gaining on the winner. DEE'S LEGS lacked early speed,
made a steady gain and finished willingly. BENISSIMO pinched back at the break, racing in the back, moved up around the final turn and made a wide gain.
CLEARLY A JET broke out, raced within striking distance, finished evenly and was never a factor. ASTROLOGY WONOWON went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground and faded. ROCKY BOY bumped at the start, raced within contention and faded. MUSTBELIEVE bumped at the start, raced near the back
and was never a threat. MY STORY always raced near the back and showed little. ZAPAWAY raced near the middle of the field, moved up, within
contention and dropped back.

Footnotes
MISS SHIPMAN sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. FORGOTTEN FORTUNE pressed the pace, racing five wide
around the first turn, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. FROSTED DIAMOND raced within contention,
saved ground around the final turn, proved no match for the top two, but held on for third. MISS LONELYHEARTS raced near the back in the beginning,
made a late bid, racing four wide and was outfinished for third. LAST OF THE NILE void of early speed and was never a factor. NEUTRALIZE pressed the
early pace and faded. KATIES SPIRIT lacked early speed and was never close.

Footnotes
WISE VERDICT unhurried in the beginning, moved up, four wide around the second turn, dueled down the lane and proved the best. IRON IN THE FIRE
went to the front, drove clear, dueled down the home stretch and was outfinished for the win. COSMIC TRAIN lacked early speed, saved ground around the
final turn, made a late gain and was a clear third. VENN pressed the early pace, weakened and was no threat late. GUITAR DOCTOR pressed the early
pace and was finished early. LAURI'S WISH raced within striking distance, saved ground and faded. GET THEM JUSTIN raced evenly near the back, had
an outside trip and was never a threat. FAST VERDICT void of early speed and showed little. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF always raced in the back and trailed
throughout.

Footnotes
BILLY BOWLEGS raced near the back in the early going, moved up around the turn, racing three wide, dueled down the stretch with EL GABRIELO and
was just up. EL GABRIELO pressed the pace, saved ground, took the lead, dueled down the rail and missed. COUNTRY CAT JAKE raced within striking
distance, made a mild bid and was a clear third at the wire. SUIT OF WANDS raced in the middle of the field, showed late interest, but was no factor. RED
IDOL lacked early speed, improved position, but was no real factor. RED ON THE HEAD lacked early speed, put forth an even effort and was no threatl.
INGLIS had an awkward start, racing in the back and passed tired ones. HOMIE'S FOOL raced in the middle of the pack in the beginning and faded.
TRIPPIN ON BEAUTY dueled on the front end, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. SCATTY CAT vied for the early advantage and retreated
to the rear.
