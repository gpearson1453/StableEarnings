Footnotes
SPANISH WELLS broke in full stride to set all the pace, was shaken up nearing the furlong marker and drew off to win going away under confident handling.
FREE FOLK allowed to set6tle, offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch then was no match for the winner while clearly second best. SKYPASS chased
the winner two wide into the stretch and faded late. READ THE ROOM was hustled along the inside, stalked the pace into the turn then gave way.

Footnotes
CHERU prompted the early pace three then four wide, took command nearing the half mile marker, set the balance of the pace and widened at will through
the stretch to win as much the best while in hand. ZIPSY ROSE LEE never far back, rallied two wide through the far turn and finished well clear for second.
QUICKSTYLE bore out at the start bumping HEART OF THE BEAST into BAD AND BEAUTIFUL, swung wide and passed tiring rivals through the stretch.
BROADWAY CHARM away alertly, set a pressured pace two then three wide for nearly a half, remained a forward factor into the far turn then weakened.
COURTING WAR close up from the start, moved up two wide nearing the half mile marker, checked when lacking room bumping into SHE'S A SOLDIER
then gave way in the stretch. HEART OF THE BEAST was bumped at the start, offered a mild bid five then three wide into the far turn then came up empty.
SHE'S A SOLDIER vied for the lead along the rail, was bumped at the half mile pole causing her rider to check and dropped out of it. BAD AND BEAUTIFUL
was bumped at the start then through early. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION. PER RULING FROM HIWU, ZIPSY
ROSE LEE WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
OHIO PLAYER was bumped at the start, set all the pace and widened through the stretch under right handed urging to in as much the best. HONOR THE D
saved ground through the turn, drifted to the four path, had a mild late rally and finished second best. PECKS NOT BAD was restless in the gate, chased the
winner and lacked the needed response. THAT'S THE WAY unhurried, passed tiring rivals three wide. STUNT MAN was forced in bumping rivals at the
start, stalked the early pace in the four path and faded on the turn. KARAMEL CORN was no factor. NAMBITI was no threat. ATTACK ANGLE veered in at
the start and had brief speed. OHIO MUNNY was bumped between rivals at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BISCAYNE BAY allowed to settle, closed rapidly three wide through the turn, made the lead in upper stretch then drew off under mild left handed urging to
win as much the best. HERE COMES JIGS unhurried early, closed willingly five wide through the stretch and got up for second. CAT'S RHYTHM trailed into
the stretch and found her best stride late four wide. SCARLETT'S AWISH was hustled along two wide, altered course four wide near the half mile marker,
stalked the pace and went evenly. WHERETHERE'SSMOKE set the early pace four wide, was headed after a quarter, kept pressure into the stretch and
weakened late. BAY MAGIC pressed the early pace three wide, made the lead past the half mile marker, set the pace into the stretch and gave way late.
PISTOL PACKIN BOS had speed along the inside into the turn then flattened out. APPEALING SENORITA stumbled a few strides out of the gate and
unseated her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

BUEHLER'S DAY OFF allowed to settle, closed ground rapidly four wide through the turn to engage the leader at the top of the stretch, matched stride two
wide until deep stretch and edged clear lead under right handed urging. QUICK QUICK WHIT pressed the pace three wide down the backstretch, made the
lead on the turn, dropped inside entering the stretch, dug in gamely when joined by the winner but finished second best. EL BANDIDO unhurried early,
passed tiring rivals through the stretch in the five path. A VAN ON THE RUN failed to menace. DARK BARON pressed the pace two wide into the stretch
then weakened. LANEHAYA was no factor. TAP YOUR HEART was hustled to a narrow lead soon after the start, set a pressured pace along the inside into
the turn, stopped abruptly entering the stretch, pulled up in deep stretch and was walked off.

Footnotes
GRAY ROYALITY allowed to settle, began to rally three wide on the far turn, was herded out five wide entering the stretch giving up some ground, surged
under right handed urging through deep stretch and got up in the final stride. CANDY ISLAND away alertly, set the pace under pressure into the stretch,
drifted out late under right handed urging and just missed hanging on. WINDY LU WHO saved ground into the far turn, altered course six wide into the
stretch and was steadily gaining ground late. SHE'S CRAFTY trailed into the stretch, shifted in from five wide to two wide in the late stages and closed a
gap. MAGIC PALACE bumped at the start, vied for the lead four then two wide into the stretch, was shut off by the runner up at the sixteenth pole causing
her rider to check and lost momentum. R THREE ANGELS moved up two wide on the far turn then came up empty. KITTEN CALLS bumped at the start
and was no factor. OAXACA chased the early pace, offered a mild bid along the inside past the half mile marker then came up empty. THE RIDER OF
MAGIC PALACE LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF CANDY ISLAND FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW
THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED CANDY ISLAND AND PLACED HER FIFTH.
