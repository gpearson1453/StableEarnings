Footnotes
SAN MARCO CITY showed no speed, trailed to the half with a solid run into the far turn and stretch, kept on to be along in time at the wire under good
handling. WRITE OFF JERRY hustled along from inside with speed to the front, nursed along to the stretch, stayed game but outkicked to the wire.
MACKENZIE'S NOVVA stutter step from the gate, perfect spot to far turn, leveled off. CALON LAN bit tardy from the gate, inside run, angled four wide far
turn. BROKEN JUSTICE never in contention throughout. SAGE RUNNER trued to keep up early with a fade from the half. KICK ROCKS KID up to duel in
the two path, stayed to half, gave in readily turn. MYSTERY IMPACT good position to the half with nothing left and faded back.
