Footnotes
SALTY GIRL , under urging soon after the break, disputed the pace outside CELTIC BOND, opened up in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and
was under encouragement. AMIE'S SYMPHONY stalked the pace, raced in the two path on the turn, remained in the two path in the stretch, was steadied
and bumped CELTIC BOND when forced in by LAUGHING FIT near the eighth pole then rallied. LAUGHING FIT stalked the duel while three wide around
the turn, drifted to the four path in upper stretch, drifted in on rivals near the eighth pole and gave way. MADDIE TEN , rank leaving the starting gate, worked
between horses in the stretch and passed tired ones. ENEMYNUMBERNINE , along the inner rail stalking the duel for five furlongs, angled to the three path
turning for home and gave way. LORRAINE'S WAY , three wide leaving the backstretch, was four wide entering the stretch and gave way. CELTIC BOND
hugged the inner rail disputing the pace, began to weaken in mid stretch, was bumped inside the eighth pole, retreated and eased late.

Footnotes
HONOR THE TRUTH , off the pace and under a hustling ride inside a rival mid turn, worked well out in the track past the three sixteenths, leveled off under
right handed encouragement past mid stretch, kept on in determined fashion and just got up. CATCH THE KITTEN moved up to the inside of rivals leaving
the chute and contested the pace, rated back near the five eighths then tracked towards the rail, eased out mid turn and then crept closer, shifted out four
wide for the drive, closed in under pressure, took a short lead in deep stretch but was nabbed at the wire. MAIL CALL had speed then was taken back off
the leaders heading to the five furlong pole, relaxed nicely three wide stalking, bid three deep near the three eighths, vied around the turn, kicked clear
under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, maintained command past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. ALWAYS FORWARD , urged inside
mid turn, eased out in upper stretch and churned on to slowly gain. POLICE WOMAN , off the pace and outside a rival mid turn, angled three wide into the
lane, shifted a bit further out past the three sixteenths and continued on with some effort. BALI HAI , three deep with the early pace, emerged in a tussle
outside SUPER MONEY past the five eighths, gained a slim lead between runners mid turn, shifted in while battling in upper stretch, fought on past mid
stretch then faded. OUT OF LUCK , off the pace, angled five wide into the stretch but failed to kick on. SUPER MONEY , off last when lunging at the break,
steadied soon after, rushed up between rivals leaving the chute and gained a short lead nearing the five furlong pole, took pressure into turn, ceded
command past the three eighths, failed to go on entering the lane and tired.

Footnotes
BACKNTHEWOODS , urged from the gate, raced forwardly and outside a rival as a contested pace went on up top, took closer order of the embattled
leaders while three wide and under a ride past the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane, closed in under left handed asks and engaged PRIVET
MOON from his outside a sixteenth out, sustained under pressure to take over and edged away late. PRIVET MOON sped to the early lead while under
rating, prompted the pace outside TAKE CHARGE TOO after that one rushed up to the inside, rebid mid turn while in hand, responded when asked and
shook clear under a drive leaving the three sixteenths, kept on while on his left lead, was guided out towards the winner when confronted with a sixteenth to
go, kept on gamely but couldn't quite match strides in the final fifty yards. CHIEF RON , inside of rivals and off the early pace, came under a ride past the
five sixteenths, eased out and advanced outside a foe in mid stretch, loomed but flattened out late. TAKE CHARGE TOO broke a step slow, rushed up
along the rail and took over from PRIVET MOON nearing the half mile marker, took pressure then dueled from the three furlong marker to upper stretch,
continued with some effort past the furlong grounds then faded. ICING flashed speed, chased outside a rival mid turn, came out a bit for the drive then
lacked a finish. TOP BOSS , a bit rank at the break, steadied soon after, raced between rivals nearing the turn, lacked a punch under pressure past the five
sixteenths and gave way. BLESSED ARION , four deep into the turn, continued off the rail mid turn and failed to drum up a response. NOAH CHANCE ,
three wide between runners, dropped back around the turn.

SHINELIKEADIAMOND set a pressured pace along the inner rail and drew off through the stretch under vigorous rousing. SMOOTH PEBBLE , three deep
around the turn, chased the winner to upper stretch then gradually weakened. ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE lightly bumped with LUNITA soon after the break,
chased the pace in the two path between horses around the turn and weakened. THEA'S THEME saved ground around the turn, chased the pace and
weakened. MISS CASEY , four deep on the turn, drifted to the five path turning for home and was not a factor. LUNITA , rank at the break, lightly bumped
with ANOTHERWORLDINSIDE soon after start, stalked the pace in the two path on the turn, swung four wide entering the stretch and failed to rally. ALAS
AND ALACK , pulled up leaving the backstretch, was vanned off.

Footnotes
HAY CHIEF , well back off the pace while saving ground, gathered momentum past the five sixteenths and got through along the rail into the lane, shifted
out and closed in four wide behind rivals past the three sixteenths, dove back down towards the rail, closed with a flourish under left handed asks, took over
with about seventy yards remaining and kicked clear. UNDER THE RADAR broke sluggishly, regrouped and settled off the pace and outside a rival early on,
commenced a wide run into the far turn, rolled up and bid four deep past the five sixteenths, was shifted out a bit when taking over entering the lane,
maintained the advantage while battling outside CROSSLAND leaving the eighth pole, ceded to the winner late but stayed on well. CROSSLAND rated in
the clear and off the inside while stalking, moved up into the far turn, bid three wide then dueled between runners holding a slim lead into the lane, stayed on
to the inside of UNDER THE RADAR past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. VICTIM OF THE NITE hopped at the break then bobbled, regrouped and
rushed up three wide to take over soon into the first turn, dropped in after clearing, was joined by rivals leaving the far turn, sparred to upper stretch,
continued with effort past mid stretch then gave way. SAGRADA RAY , away in awkward fashion, raced well back into the backstretch, moved up a bit and
outside a rival leaving the three eighths, chased three wide into the lane but failed to seriously kick on. VON HOFF had speed then rated off the leader
around the first turn to stalk, moved up when given his cue into the far turn, bid between runners, disputed the pace into the lane, shifted in some past mid
stretch and weakened. FIND FAITH , towards the inside, had a mild gain two wide leaving the three eighths, chased briefly then faltered through the drive.

Footnotes
DOCTOR ABBIE raced in the two path between horses on the turn, worked between rivals in upper stretch, moved outside KNICKERSINATWIST in mid
stretch, took the lead near the sixteenth pole then drove clear. MAVILUS , four deep on the turn, was well placed turning for home, lacked the necessary
rally but gained the place position in deep stretch. KNICKERSINATWIST stalked the early pace, two wide around the turn, took the lead and went clear
turning for home and weakened late. HAINT BLUE bumped with I CAN RUN soon after the break, trailed to the stretch, swung to the five path in upper
stretch and passed tired foes. I CAN RUN , rank at the break, bobbled and bumped with HAINT BLUE soon after the start, hugged the inner rail around the
turn and failed to rally. FRECCIA D'ARGENTO rushed to the early lead, set the pace along the rail for five furlongs and faltered in upper stretch.
PEPPERMINT CLASS chased the pace in the three path around the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
TAPPIN JOSIE , three deep under a hustling ride pursuing the leader, shifted out a bit into the lane, closed in to take command outside rivals with a furlong
remaining, kept on under strong handling to deny ANONYMOUSLY then was pulled up after a brief gallop out and vanned off. ANONYMOUSLY chased to
the inside of a pair of rivals, edged up into the lane, challenged for the lead a furlong out, battled gamely inside the winner through the final sixteenth but
wasn't quite good enough. MY FLICKER , bumped at the break, raced well off the early pace while outside a rival, angled five wide into the lane and offered
a mild response. AKEMI sped well clear early, set the pace two to three wide into the lane, was engaged from both sides leaving the three sixteenths and
weakened through the final seventy yards. SWEET GRACIE came out at the break and bumped with MY FLICKER, lagged off the pace while saving
ground, came off the inside for the drive, steadied briefly near mid stretch then failed to generate a serious finish. FUHGEDDABOUDIT , between runners
pursuing the pace, failed to kick on in upper stretch then gave way.

GRACE AND CHARM saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, advanced along the inner rail to gain a short lead in mid stretch and prevailed in an
extended drive. THENCOMEMORNING drifted six wide on the turn and rallied outside. NEVER DONE chased the pace two wide around the turn, was
fanned to the three path entering the stretch, battled outside the winner and gave way grudgingly. PROPER STORM lacked speed, raced along the inner
rail around the turn, moved out, worked between horses and passed tired ones. SHE SO COOL , outrun, was never a factor. EARLEY ROSE raced along
the inner rail around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. PLEASE MARRY ME , right to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and gave way in
mid stretch.
