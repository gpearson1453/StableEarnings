Footnotes
GENERAL BANKER jostled with a foe near the seven-eighths pole, was well placed just off the pace, went around the early part of the turn in the two path,
was roused near the five-sixteenths then shifted four wide, rallied five wide into the stretch, took over before the three-sixteenths pole, battled outside of the
runner-up under the crop into the final sixteenth then prevailed while put under a strong hand-ride to the finish. BOURBON CHASE was rated just off the
pace, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, came four wide into the stretch, battled inside of the winner in the drive and was
outfinished while well clear for the place. PRINCE OF PHAROAHS stalked the pace on the outside, turned up the pressure in the two path early on the turn,
took the lead approaching the three-eighths pole, spun three wide into the stretch then lost the advantage to the winner, dropped back into the final furlong
and weakened. COLLOQUY bumped lightly with a foe at the start, prompted the pace on the inside of the leader, dropped back a bit inside the five-eighths
pole, drafted inside on the turn, was shuffled back behind LOBSTA outside the quarter-pole, moved to the two path shortly thereafter, remained on his inside
lead in the stretch and came up empty. LOBSTA made light contact with a foe at the start, moved out while going to the front, dropped in outside the
five-eighths pole, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the lead nearing the three-eighths pole, dropped back approaching the
quarter-pole and tired. SUNDAESWITHSANDY was hustled from the gate, jostled with an opponent near the seven-eighths pole, settled off the pace,
dropped back under urging late on the backstretch, fell well behind while in the two to three path on the turn and was eased but walked off then was
reported to have bled.

Footnotes
VOLEUSE was last to commence, moved up on the outside under urging then tracked the pace, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid inside the
three-eighths pole, took the advantage at the quarter-pole, was roused into upper stretch, came in under a right-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths,
fought outside the runner-up under the crop past the eighth-pole, continued to battle outside the runner-up while under a strong hand-ride in the final furlong
and prevailed under good handling. FRANNIE LEW pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead coming to the nine-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the
turn, was headed under urging at the quarter-pole, fought on inside the winner in the stretch but missed while clear for the place. GHOSTLY GIRL was
urged along off the pace, chased while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and weakened while
best of the rest. YANKEE AGATE went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside, lost the lead approaching the nine-sixteenths pole, dropped
back at the seven-sixteenths pole, saved ground on the turn and came up empty. HYPNOCURRENCY was coaxed along at the rear, dropped well behind
while saving ground on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend and faltered.

command nearing the eighth pole, edged clear under a drive kept to task. WHENLOVETAKESOVER showed the way in hand along the inside, came under
coaxing at the three-eighths when DR. SETTLE'S DREAM advanced outside and dueled with that rival through the latter portion of the turn, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared outside the eighth pole, ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest for the place
honors. RED D G P broke in at the start bumping and squeezing back AGILITY in tandem with YOUBETTERBEJOKING, chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. YOUBETTERBEJOKING broke out at the start bumping and
pinching back AGILITY in concert with RED D G P, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper
stretch and improved position to the wire. DR. SETTLE'S DREAM coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before
advancing to engage that rival in head to head combat through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
weakened in the final furlong. SCOTTO bobbled at the break, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and weakened. AGILITY got bumped between foes who each broke his way and was squeezed back at the start conceding four lengths to the front before
settling into stride, advanced down the backstretch to be in range of the leader and chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. HONED coaxed from the start, chased four wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went seven wide into

HALINA'S FORTE chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and advancing on the leader, swung five wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away under a drive to prevail. GHALIA PRINCESS dueled from the two path with RECONCILE to her outside,
shook off that rival three furlongs out, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared at the eighth pole, ran on willingly to
the finish. VALUE AREA broke in at the start bumping MOST OF ALL into LOW SOCIETY, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. LOW
SOCIETY got bumped at the start by MOST OF ALL due to pressure from VALUE AREA breaking inwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from
midway on the turn, angled four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. RECONCILE got bumped at the start by TIARELLA and bobbled, led briefly
before dueling three wide with GHALIA PRINCESS to her inside, got shake off three furlongs from home and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths
when joined outside by the eventual winner, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. TIARELLA broke in a step at the start bumping RECONCILE and
forcing that foe to bobble, raced five then four wide just off the duel, came under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and
tired. MOST OF ALL got bumped at the start by VALUE AREA and in turn bumped LOW SOCIETY, chased four wide until tucked inside at the half mile

Footnotes
TRUE EMPRESS broke in at the start, was urged along towards the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into upper stretch then moved
further out, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late and prevail. NEWSDLEY went to the front, set the pace under pressure to
her outside, was asked near the seven-sixteenths, vied two path to the inside on the turn, was headed near the quarter-pole, fought on gamely while
remaining on her inside lead, swapped to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole then regained the advantage, led until the final strides but was denied
while clear for the place. LUNA'S SONG was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging while three then two wide on the turn, dropped back
three wide into upper stretch, kept on in pursuit of the leaders in the final furlong and finished willingly to just get the show. GHOSTBUSTIN pressed the
pace on the outside, drew even with the leader while four then three wide on the turn, gained a narrow advantage near the quarter-pole, led under a drive
into the final furlong, lost the advantage back to the runner-up before the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished then lost the show. LITTLE LINZEE settled off
the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then moved further out, held a good striking position into the final furlong
but lacked the needed kick then just missed the superfecta. MIM broke a step slow, moved up to track the pace on the outside, chased five then four wide
on the turn and tired. QUICK POWER NAP broke a half-step slow, was coaxed along off the pace, went three wide on the turn and failed to rally. EASY
PLAY stumbled very badly at the start then was checked sharply while trying to recover, spotted the front many lengths, moved out while the rider made
sure that everything was in good order, went five wide on the turn and was no factor. BUSSIA bobbled after the start then dropped back, settled towards the
rear, dropped back late on the backstretch, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MEMPHIS established a good position towards the front, was urged while moving from the rail to the four path on the turn, gained under a drive to make a
bid between horses at the three-sixteenths, dueled inside of the runner-up to the finish and gamely prevailed under strong urging. SOUTH STREET dropped
back early then settled towards the rear, gained five to six wide on the turn, made an outside bid in upper stretch, dueled outside of the winner to the finish
and just missed while well clear for the place. DEPUTY CONNECT bumped with a rival at the start, raced at the rear, angled in near the three-quarter pole,
went around most of the turn in the two path, angled out late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and improved position. UNCLE WATER FLOW
settled off the pace, raced inside to the two path on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to threaten. ARREBATO disputed the pace on the
outside, vied in the two to three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. BARGAINING
POWER broke in at the start, contested the pace on the inside of an opponent, vied inside to the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and
weakened. GUARD OF HONOUR made light contact with a foe at the start then was hustled, chased the pace, went four to five wide on the turn and came
up empty. OPPORTUNITY SET bobbled at the start and bumped with a foe then was hustled, moved up with five furlongs to run, chased three to four wide
