Footnotes
BEACH STORM was forced out by the stumbling inside foe at the start, settled into stride off the leaders, advanced near but off the rail on the turn angling
seven wide coming to the top of the stretch, took the lead in upper stretch racing outside the loose horse and was taken in hand late when safely in front.
UNDERNUMBERED broke just a step slowly, advanced forward under coaxing between the loose horse and the early leader along the inside, took over
and led them into the turn going about three wide on that bend, was overtaken in upper stretch and no match for the winner but clearly second best.
COMFORTS JAZEL stalked from outside going three to four wide on the turn, was no match for the top pair. SHEZA GOIN COMFORT was forced inwards
by the loose horse in the early going and with the lead, was soon overtaken, encouraged along inside but had no extra. RUNNING ROGUE raced off the
pace and was never near enough to threaten. AX'S BOUNCY CAT stumbled at the start losing the rider. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
MISS LUCKY LADY was in tight at the start while forced out, stalked the early leaders in behind, moved rapidly between foes to the lead about the half
racing four wide into the turn, drifted out leaving that bend while clear, held safe under moderate urging. WHAT A MEMORY had the early lead shifting
nearer the inside, was soon overtaken and continued to chase in behind, switched outside the leader floating eight wide into upper stretch, was no match
but second best. VERMEIL was just off the leaders in the very early going but soon steadily dropped back to the rear up the backstretch. DOM PROUD
broke outwardly, settled at the rear, went two wide on the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, ran on. MOBILEAGILEHOSTILE was in tight at the start,
chased from outside into the turn, lacked the needed late kick. ILOVEHER was never a threat racing inside. QUICK SANDY was in just a bit tight at the
start, moved out and pulled forward to press the pace racing mostly five to six deep, faded on the turn, was not persevered with in the stretch and walked
off.

Footnotes
OUR VALENTINO moved four wide and between foes early on the turn, floated six deep coming out of that bend while taking the lead, drew clear, held.
SHAME ON WHISKEY bumped a rival at the start, settled off the pace, angled nine wide at the top of the stretch, was flying late. AARON WHO pursued
from outside and asked for more by the five-sixteenths racing five to six deep, kept on in the stretch. SINAI settled off the pace mid-division racing off the
rail, angled five wide in upper stretch, ran on. REYNALDO P. was quick to the lead, shifted in a bit setting the pace from off the rail, pressed by outside foes,
drifted out leaving the turn, weakened in the stretch. SHUG'S ROCKET was bumped at the start, forwardly-placed tracking inside, weakened. SNOW
BOOTS pressed from outside three to four wide, ridden along about the three-eighths, dropped back and altered inside the leader past the quarter pole,
tired. TRUST PACO P broke a bit awkwardly and a step slowly, was never a threat and raced a little rank.

Footnotes
BODIE'SLITTLEGIRL was encouraged along early racing off the pace, shifted out five wide turning for home, struck the lead about seventy yards out and
edged clear. SHE HIT A HOMER settled off the pace, moved four to five wide on the turn, had the lead in upper stretch, was outfinished. ANNA B was
well-positioned stalking in behind the leading pair going three to four wide on the turn, kept on but needed more. ATTILAS GAL dueled outside, drifted out a
bit turning for home, weakened. HEAR ME ROAR tracked in behind and off the rail through the turn, failed to rally. FLOWER POWER dueled inside, came
up empty. DOUBLE STORM was never a threat.

Footnotes
RISKY REVENGE switched out racing wide up the backstretch, made a swift move outside four to five deep on the turn, took the lead by the top of the
stretch, moved clear and held. LONZO WHO stalked from outside, edged closer heading into the turn, was encouraged along past the three-eighths within
striking range, floated seven wide into upper stretch, kept on. THRUTHESTORM was off the early pace, came into upper stretch four wide, shifted in and
rallied inside to just get up for show. DIABOLICAL RULER set the pace in the clear from off the rail, weakened, lost show. MAMIE'S LAST HOPE stalked
the clear leader early, edged closer gradually, was even with that one and put to urging at the five-sixteenths, faltered in the stretch. AMERICAN SOLO
raced off the inside, failed to threaten. EVACUEE was off the pace inside, came out at the top of the stretch, was never a threat. RIG RIDER raced near the
inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SERPICO R S S broke awkwardly veering in and bumping and bothering rivals at the start, stalked the leaders, moved five wide on the turn, was carried out
about eight deep into upper stretch, took the lead, moved clear, held. JON L was bumped and bothered at the break, settled off the pace racing near the
fence, rallied inside a rival late for second. WIND RIVER broke outwardly bothering rivals soon after the start, set the pace on a narrow advantage inside
rivals but off the fence, drifted out a bit turning for home, was outkicked. D C GUN RUNNER was bumped and forced into a rival at the start, raced up close
but well off the inside into the turn going about four to six deep, swung out wider into upper stretch, drifted in through mid- to late-stretch while gaining.
PLAYING FIELD was forced out into a rival just after the start, raced in behind the leaders and off the rail, was blocked late lacking room between and
behind. THOUGHTS OF GOLD was bumped on both sides and squeezed back at the start, settled at the back inside, came out in upper stretch, finished up
well but too late. DISTORTED GUY shifted in saving ground on the turn, was not a threat. LEAP DAY attended the pace pressing from between runners,
went three wide on the turn, came up empty. TIZ'A STELLAR DUDE attended the pace from outside racing four to five wide on the turn, came up empty and
faded in the stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, SERPICO R S S WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED
SECOND BEHIND JON L, AND WIND RIVER WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED SIXTH BEHIND PLAYING FIELD FOR

Footnotes
WHEREDOESTHECASHGO got away alertly, was urged clear, set the pace from off the rail, held. HESA PROSPECTOR settled into stride, advanced five
to seven wide on the turn, couldn't reach the winner but was clearly second best. LUCK IN MY EYES settled off the pace, shifted in, saved ground on the
turn, secured show honors. COLOR ME GONE was encouraged along two to three wide on the turn, swung ten wide into upper stretch, showed mild late
interest to improve position. GOLDEN BAND chased from outside going four to five wide through the turn, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened.
BISCUIT SNATCHER chased from between runners three to four wide into the turn, dropped back and came out six wide leaving that bend but altered
inside a drifting foe in upper stretch, ran on. GATLING GOLD broke outwardly, was well back racing off the inside, improved. SANTIAGO'S TOWER was
outside about mid-pack on the turn racing five to eight wide, was carried about eleven deep into upper stretch, was unable to menace. CHUCKIES CHANCE
was mid-pack racing inside, went two to three deep on the turn, failed to threaten. OAKES CROSSING chased from inside, came up empty. BLACK EYED
BANDIT broke a bit awkwardly, was outside at the rear, moved out eleven wide in upper stretch and was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
MADDIE POPPE was soon clear, set the pace from off the rail, was all out in late stretch and just lasted. DESERT SPIRIT settled off the pace and off the
inside, moved out eight wide in upper stretch, rallied while bumping with a foe late and just missed. BERNICE WHO advanced outside on the turn five to
seven wide, came out a bit further for the stretch run, finished strongly, bumped with a foe late and missed. CRYSTAL WHO pursued two to three wide, ran
evenly. MISS JAX raced up close inside, steadily dropped back, angled ten wide turning into upper stretch, kept on to come again for a better placing.
ARTFUL ROSE chased three wide, was in behind the eventual winner coming into upper stretch, lugged in a bit, weakened. JEDI JENNIE chased four wide,
moved out six deep on the turn, tired. EVIL TEMPTATION raced off the inside, failed to menace. SHOULDABEENACOWGAL saved ground, failed to
menace. EVANGELINA WHO made an early advance heading into the turn five then four wide, faltered and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
INTO LATE STRETCH NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
