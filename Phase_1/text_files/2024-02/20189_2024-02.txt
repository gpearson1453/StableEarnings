inside and weakened in the stretch. LADY SHEBOYGAN settled just behind the dueling leaders, moved closer into the far turn then tired. MOON AT NIGHT
trailed early, angled out on the turn and went evenly through the stretch. LA BELLA BOROBETA flashed speed three wide down the backstretch and

PARISIAN VIBE dueled outside, shook loose into the stretch, widened nearing the eighth pole and just lasted. BELLA MARIA lacked speed, advanced
inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well just missing. CICI UNIFIED chased wide down the backstretch and continued willingly. ANGELIC GAL
made a menacing rail bid on the turn then flattened out in the stretch. SWEET LILLY FACTUM was taken up appearing rank just after the start and was no
factor. LADY SICARIA dueled with the winner along the inside and gave way in the stretch. PEARLBDANCING raced within range to the far turn and
stopped.
