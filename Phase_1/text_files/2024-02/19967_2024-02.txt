DESTINED TO DANCE dropped to race mid pack early, raced four wide around the far turn, surged late and just missed in a game effort. APPEALING

was a factor. GOODBYE KYLE void of early speed and lacked a bid. HERETODAYGONMANANA dropped back and failed to respond. WHISKEY TALKING

CREME DE LA QUEEN sprinted clear early and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. THETA chased the early leader two deep and was no
match for the winner. OUR BREW coaxed along early, raced four wide around the far turn and had not enough. PALACIO chased the pace from the inside
and raced raced evenly. UNALTERED dropped back to race mid pack, was three to four wide around the far turn and never menaced. SWISS HORIZON
was coaxed along the inside and never threatened. FROSTY RIA failed to respond. RUMORGOINGAROUND was void of speed and never threatened.
