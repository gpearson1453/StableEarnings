Footnotes
BRASSTOWN assumed the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and steadily pulled away through the stretch while kept under encouragement.
BAHAMA CHANNEL , in hand along the inner rail down the backstretch while stalking the winner, futilely chased that one through the stretch and was best
of the ohers. FORMAL ORDER advanced three deep leaving the backstretch and failed to sustain the move. TRANSFER THE FUNDS , in the two path
down the backstretch and around the far turn, chased the winner, gave way in upper stretch and was eased. TINY TIN stumbled at the break and trailed.

Footnotes
UNION FLEET broke a step slow, quickly recovered and was taken to rate, edged up off the rail and raced just off the leaders into the turn, sat patiently past
the three eighths, moved through between rivals soon into the lane, bid inside MOSE PERFECT heading to the eighth pole, put a head in front soon after,
dueled and held tenaciously under a drive to prevail. MOSE PERFECT tracked a three pronged pace scrum while under rating and well off the inside, bid
four deep to engage into the far turn, battled outside WHAT DOES IT TAKE past the three eighths, took over into the lane, shook clear under left handed
asks, was hooked from his inside past the three sixteenths, fought gamely but was kept at bay. WHAT DOES IT TAKE , three deep on a short lead through
the backstretch and into the turn, was joined from his outside by MOSE PERFECT soon after, dueled to the inside of that one to upper stretch, shifted out
nearing mid stretch and faded. A C EXPRESSWAY , off the pace while saving ground, shifted out near the three sixteenths but lacked a solid run. BERKS
was sent up to the inside of runners near the three quarter pole, vied into the turn, could not keep pace nearing the lane and weakened. HUNTER JOE ,
between runners contesting the early pace, dropped inside to pursue around the turn, lacked a response past the three sixteenths and gave way.

Footnotes
TOO MANY KISSES settled well off the early pace while saving ground, worked outward when advancing into the lane, straightened away in about the five
path, responded to left handed asks, sustained a grinding run and forged past BAY STREET in the final yards. BAY STREET , taken to rate off the pace,
was floated out to about the four path when commencing a run leaving the far turn, continued wide progress into the lane, closed in under a drive to put a
head in front in mid stretch, wandered outward leaving the sixteenth pole, corrected with right handed urging, kept on gamely but just could not fend off the
winner. WHATSYOURBIGIDEA sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, was guided three wide under a ride into the lane, dug in when collared
past the three sixteenths, dueled then faded late. FAST TRACKED , forwardly placed behind a rival early on, altered out off heels near the half, drifted out
some leaving the far turn, kept getting out and entered the lane about five wide, corrected under pressure and churned on. GOLDIENESS prompted the
pace outside the leader, was hard ridden mid turn, shifted in for the drive and gave way. BOSSYNESS lagged off the pace while saving ground, angled
three to four wide into the stretch but came up empty.

IT'S SIZZLING TIME , taken in hand while off the pace and saving ground, advanced within himself past the five sixteenths to take aim, responded when set
down in upper stretch, closed towards the rail and engaged DOUBLE CROWN with a sixteenth to go, gained a slim lead soon after, dug in gamely and got
the bob. DOUBLE CROWN , away in good order, secured the inside and rated off the clear leader, moved up without much asking into the far turn, eased
out past the three eighths, went on the attack and engaged BOB MARCO nearing the lane, forged clear under a ride in mid stretch, drifted out briefly, was
guided down towards the winner a sixteenth out, battled valiantly but just missed. BE BETTER lagged far off the early pace, moved up three deep nearing
the half mile marker, was under a hearty ride trying to pick things up past the three eighths, circled five wide into the stretch and churned on to nab the
show. BOB MARCO moved up three wide to take command into the first turn, opened up then dropped in to set a rated pace, saw his lead diminish leaving
the far turn, came under a ride past the five sixteenths, ceded command while two wide past the three sixteenths, stayed on with effort past the sixteenth
marker then faded late. MARTINI MARTIN , unhurried early while saving ground, raced to the inside of a pair of rivals past the five eighths, stayed inside for
the drive and offered a mild run. VANCE SCHOLARS , off the pace and outside a rival, advanced past the five sixteenths, shifted out four wide into the lane
but came up empty. AIN'T DA BEER COLD was sent early, angled out after the leader cleared off, rated outside DOUBLE CROWN, moved up with that one
into the far turn, was under a ride chasing with aim past the three eighths, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and weakened. YODEL E. A. WHO , off
the pace and between rivals past the five eighths, failed to respond.

CHARMING WAY , angled out leaving the first turn, stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced in the two path, secured command mid way on the far
turn, opened up, drifted out in mid stretch and was kept to her business in the drive. FROSTY O TOOLE lacked speed, saved ground around the far turn,
remained along the inner rail through the stretch and rallied. NEW HIRE , briefly steadied on heels leaving the first turn, raced forwardly down the
backstretch, was in the two path the far turn, swung four wide entering the stretch and flattened out. HYBRID ECLIPSE trailed down the backstretch, raced
in the two path between horses the far turn, remained between rivals in the stretch and passed tired ones. IN MY OPINION stalked the pace, circled the far
turn three wide and gave way in upper stretch. HASHTAG LUCKY sprinted clear soon after the break and was taken to the inner rail, set the pace along the
rail for six furlongs and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
APPLE PICKER , taken to rate inside and off of contested pace, came under a ride as the leading pair widened a bit past the three eighths, stayed inside
and gathered steam past the three sixteenths, altered out off heels soon after, split rivals under stout handling, took command inside the sixteenth pole and
drew clear. LAST LEAF , urged along while saving ground, angled out edging up into the stretch, straightened away to be about four wide, closed in under
pressure, drew on near even terms a sixteenth out, wandered late, flattened out and managed to save the place. PRODIGY DOLL , off the pace and outside
a rival mid turn, swung out to be six to seven wide in upper stretch, closed steadily and just missed the show. DISCO EBO took command between rivals
early then was joined from her outside by BENEATH THE STARS, sparred with that one into and around the turn while coaxed along, shook clear under a
drive leaving the three sixteenths, fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. BLUEFIELD stalked between foes, steadied back off rivals
when in a bit tight past the three eighths, angled out to give hard chase, came five wide for the drive but lacked a serious finish. CONTINENTALCONGRES
was steadied off foes leaving the chute, recovered to stalk three wide, was under a ride into the lane and faded. BENEATH THE STARS ducked out at the
break, straightened and attended the pace four wide outside foes, dropped in a couple paths and battled head to head with DISCO EBO into the turn,
carried that scrum to upper stretch then weakened through the final furlong.

POST TIME , unhurried down the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, was caught behind horses in upper stretch, swung to the five path
approaching the eighth pole, was under brisk urging, swept to the lead near the sixteenth pole then drew away. SEVEN'S ELEVEN bumped GREELEY AND
BEN when bearing out leaving the starting gate, sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, finished willingly but was second best.
TENEBRIS broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace while three deep around the turn, had aim in mid stretch and flattened out. NIMITZ CLASS , a forward
factor in the two path while prompting the pace around the turn, gave way the final furlonh. NO CENTS , snugly rated along the inner rail behind horses
down the backstretch and on the turn, failed to rally when asked in upper stretch. GREELEY AND BEN , bumped and forced out leaving the starting gate,
circled the turn four wide, drifted to the six path in upper stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
TITIAN TYRANT took over at once, set a rated pace towards the rail, responded when set down in upper stretch, kept on under solid handling through the
final furlong and prevailed. MUCHO MACHO MRYTLE rated close up while saving ground, eased out with aim into the lane, wandered outward from left
handed asks leaving mid stretch, corrected to make one final surge at the winner but just could not get up. VOODOO PRIESTESS steadied when forced out
at the break regrouped and settled off the pace, angled out to be four deep near the five sixteenths, shifted in some for the drive and offered a mild kick.
PREAKNESS PARTY settled towards the rail and in the clear through the backstretch run, edged up to the inside of rivals leaving the three eighths, chased
into stretch then faded. KANEM , off the pace while saving ground, swung wide for the drive but lacked a rally. NEVERTOOMUCHELVIS , four wide the first
turn, stalked three wide through the backstretch run, chased between rivals nearing the five sixteenths and weakened. INSTPARTY bore out at the break,
corrected and moved up to track outside the winner, failed to kick on leaving the five sixteenths and faltered.
