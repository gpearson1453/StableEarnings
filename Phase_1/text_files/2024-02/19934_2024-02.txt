Footnotes
BUBBA CAN DANCE stalked along the inside, loomed with run from the pocket around the far turn, tipped to take aim outside of the leader in upper stretch,
blew past that one at the three sixteenths pole and drew off under driving pressure. PATH TO SUCCESS steadied while losing his path into the first turn,
raced at the rear in the three path before saving ground around the far turn, shifted to the four to five path to split horses in upper stretch and ran on to reach
place in the shadow of the wire. LIL BRO COOP showed the way along the inside, offered little resistance to an outer challenge at the three sixteenths pole,
gave way and lost place at the wire. MR MIDWAY broke outwardly, stalked three wide before pressing two wide approaching the far turn, sustained
pressure under coaxing around that bend but gave way when floated three wide in upper stretch. KAHALA broke a step slow and took light contact from an
outer rival at the start, trailed in the five path, moved out of last in the four path around the far turn, but floated to the six path entering the lane and failed to
menace. ABSOLUTE COURAGE leaned in and brushed a rival at the start, pressed two wide and between horses, failed to sustain position nearing the
nine sixteenths pole and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
MISS ROSIE tracked in the three path, slowly closed in on the tiring leader in the final furlong and reeled that one in at the wire. BAYOU BERTIE sped clear
to a wide advantage early on, added to her margin turning for home, but began to tire entering the final furlong while hanging on her left lead and was nailed
at the wire. C C SENORA chased from midpack in the four path and moved up. RADIANT REBEL stalked in the two path while closest to the clear leader,
but lacked a bid and lost show at the wire. CLEARLY CREEPS was last away, pursued from off of the pace along the inside and failed to factor. AWREE
lacked speed in the four to five path around the turn and made little impact. HOLY MOLY SHIPMAN showed little.

Footnotes
SPEEDY DUDETTE showed the way along the inside, inched clear turning for home in the two path, drifted outwardly in midstretch and held sway through
the final furlong. A G'S CHARLOTTE was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, stalked three wide, pursued from the four path around the
far turn, chased the clear leader in upper stretch, shifted inside of that drifting rival at the furlong grounds, but flopped back to her left lead while taking aim in
the final sixteenth and needed more. FOR HARPER tracked along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, yet kept on to edge show from an
outer rival in midstretch. HIGHLY WICKED came in and bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide and between horses, failed to sustain pressure
despite rider's urging turning for home and gave way. TINCANDANCE never got involved from the two path. FORT POLK was bumped by outer rivals at the
start, trailed in the three to four path before steadying behind kickback leaving the first turn, moved out of last into the far turn, but tired in midstretch and
was outrun.

SHE'S JERSEY TUFF bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, offered a rail rally through the lane and reeled in the leader in
time. LITTLE BLAZE dueled for the lead with an outer rival, drew clear of that one at the quarter pole, but drifted outwardly inside the final furlong before
wandering back inwardly entering the final sixteenth, and was caught by an inner bidder in the shadow of the wire. HURRICANE LASSIE tracked the
embattled leading pair from the three to four path, then chased willingly through the lane but needed more to offer a bid. FIRST LOVE dueled for the lead
two wide, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart entering the lane and gave way. BEDOWNTOFOOLAROUND bumped with an inner rival upon
leaving the gates, but lacked speed two wide and was outrun. SAVAGE DARLING refused at the start. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
REVIEWING THE START AND RULED NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
PACIFICISLANDTIME stalked three wide, bid and vied outside of the leader around the far turn, then drew off entering upper stretch. DUDE DROP KID
pursued from midpack three wide, chased in the four path around the far turn, then ran on in the five path to gain place at the sixteenth pole.
GUITARTUITION PLZZ tracked along the inside, bid for place two wide and between horses in midstretch but got outkicked. I DON'T VENMO tracked two
wide and between horses, moved to the inside down the backstretch, stalked before tipping to the four path entering the lane, but only managed to chase
between horses and lacked a bid. TONTERIA raced off of the pace two wide and between horses, got floated three wide in upper stretch before in a bit tight
of quarters at the furlong grounds and failed to menace. SLICK AND FAST set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge around the far turn, got
headed nearing the lane and weakened. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT was taken back at the start, pulled while off of the pace along the inside around the first turn
culminating in steadying entering the backstretch, shfited to the five path soon after and failed to factor. MALAKI EMPIRE fidgeted and shifted weight just
before the gates sprung causing him to hop at the start, bumped the gate and spotted the rest many lengths in the process, then was outrun along the
inside. SONYA KNOWS BETTER showed little. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START, MALAKI EMPIRE WAS DECALRED A
NON-STARTER.

GUNNER BAY bumped with an inner rival while off a tad slow at the start, recovered to stalk the top trio from the four path, bid outside of the leader at the
furlong grounds, wrestled an advantage entering the final sixteenth and shifted ground outwardly while edging away. MESA SPIRIT broke a bit outwardly,
vied three wide, led turning for home, inched clear entering the lane, met an outer challenge in midstretch, got bested by that one at the sixteenth pole and

slow, raced at the rear along the inside and moved up. WESTERN COMMAND chased from midpack in the three path, shifted to the six path entering the

way in the three path, hung on her left lead before greenly changing over nearing the furlong grounds, but was caught by an inner bidder at the sixteenth
pole, yielded yet saved place. LILY'S WOOFY stalked in the four path, chased through the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival in the final furlong, hung
late and failed to reach place. SAINT EROS GIRL tracked in the five path, shifted inwardly in upper stretch and lacked a bid. CARSON'S PRINCESS raced
off of the pace in the four path and between horses, then failed to factor. MADAM HENNY lacked speed in the five to six path and made little impact. NEED
