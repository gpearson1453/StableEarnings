RUNANDHIDE WIND sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and was kept to the task. DEFINE broke out, brushed rival, pressed the pace, proved
no match for winner, but was a clear second. ONE MORE BABY brushed at the start, raced within striking distance, came around the second turn on the
outside, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. CAJUN CONNECTION showed early speed, forwardly placed throughout and faded. DEAL
WITH HIM lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. HOMELAND MESSA raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. MESABI lacked early
speed and showed little. ROLL ON OUT raced within contention, saved ground and dropped back. XIETELEHUAS always raced near the back and was
outrun.

effort. THE GREY BEAUTY raced in the middle of the pack and lacked a bid. JULIO CHOICE void of early speed, raced wide around the final turn and was
