Footnotes
SIMULTANEITY vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and pulled away down the lane, proving the best. MRS. KATZ dueled on the front
end, came around the final turn on the outside, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. CHASING SUMMER lacked early speed, racing
outside, made a late bid and was outfinished for second. SAUCY SIX raced evenly near the back, saved ground and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT IRIS
raced within contention, faded and was no threat late. SAINT ISABEL raced near the back, had an outside trip and was never a threat.

Footnotes
COROT pressed the pace, moved up around the turn, took command and was going away at the end. STRAIGHTEN UP went to the front, drove clear,
saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. SLITHER void of early speed, raced outside around the turn, made a wide gain,
proved no match for the top two, but got up for show. OJITOS lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, made a mild bid and was outfinished for
third. TRIPPER JOHN showed early speed, saved ground around the turn, weakened and lacked a late kick. DIABLO CAT raced in the middle of the field,
came around the turn on the outside and put forth an even effort. ANDIAMO GIACOMO lacked early speed and was never close. CHICAGO CHROME
raced near the back and showed little. KAHAAL raced within striking distance, dropped back and was outrun.

Footnotes
RECKLESS RANSOM pressed the pace, raced close throughout, drove clear down the lane and finished well. WONDER RUN raced near the back in the
beginning, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide gain, proved no match for the winner, but got up for second. WHY JOEY WHY vied for
the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and was caught late for second. BAYOU BEAUX went to the front, led until the home stretch and weakened.
GOLD MERRITT pressed the early pace, weakened and lacked a finish. MY MAN LOUIE void of early speed and passed tired ones. WAR SONG raced in
the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn and was never a factor. HONORARIAN lacked early speed and was never close. GRAND PRADO
raced near the back and showed little.

of the pack in the early part, showed late interest, but was no factor. COURTLY DOC raced evenly near the back in the beginning, moved up, but was no
factor. GYPSYROSELEE dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. THAT IS AWESOME raced within contention, made a bid around the final turn,

Footnotes
FIRE VISION went to the front, saved ground around the turn, drove clear and was kept to the task. TWO JET raced within contention, came around the
turn on the outside, entered the stretch wide, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. NODAH bumped at the start, racing in the back, made
a steady gain on the inside and was outfinished for second. SUZY DOLL'S READY raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, made a bid and
hung. SUMMER IS HOT raced evenly near the back, saved ground around the turn and lacked a rally. SUMMERTIME BANDIT lacked early speed, moved
up, but was no factor. STORMY VALENTINE showed early speed and was finished early. TENSAS LU LU pressed the early pace and dropped back.
MARINA bumped at the start, raced near the back and showed little.

Footnotes
DOCE DE LA NOCHE unhurried in the beginning, saved ground around the turn, angled out, split rivals down the stretch and proved the best. SUIT OF
WANDS raced within contention, was carried wide into the home stretch, made a bid and was outfinished for the win. COUNTRY CAT JAKE pressed the
pace, raced close throughout and was outfinished by the top two. INGLIS went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and lacked a late kick. CORTE void of
early speed, came around the turn wide, moved up, but was no factor. CHIEF HARLAN lacked early speed and was never a threat. TOMMY SIX FINGERS
pressed the pace, drifted out entering the home stretch and faded. WILDCATS'S MEOW raced in the middle of the field, dropped back and was outrun.
