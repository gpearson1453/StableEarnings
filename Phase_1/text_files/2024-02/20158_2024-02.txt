Footnotes
SPOOKY LITTLE GIRL sped off to on a clear lead to set a well rated pace in hand, responded when called upon in upper stretch and widened her lead
having never been challenged. CRYSTAL M stalked the leader from between horses into the turn, made a steady advance while angling in to cut the corner
coming for home and finished willingly as second best. EXTRA CRAFTY tracked the pace from three wide into the turn, rallied on the bend and flattened out
down the lane. SHE'S A SOLDIER broke a step slow to trail early, gained ground down the backside to be mid-pack on the turn and failed to sustain the
rally. SUPER SCAMP trailed most of the way and passed a tiring rival in the stretch. APPALACHIAN SPIRIT prompted the pace for three-eights and came
up empty.

MISS SHADY stalked the pacesetters to midway on the turn, circled three wide to engage the leader in upper stretch and pulled clear down the lane.
CURIOSITY KILLS set a pressured pace for a half mile, shook off the presser, responded to challenge of the winner at the head of the lane and finished
willingly to be second best. OOPSIE DOOPSIE broke awkwardly causing the rider to lose his left iron leaving the gate, recovered the iron at the
nine-sixteenth pole while rushing up to duel on the lead, battled to the quarter pole and weakened. O K BABY went evenly as a non-factor. RIVERVIEW
STEVIE chased the leaders down the backside, was put to a drive at the three-eighths pole and lacked a response.

Footnotes
MALI BALI tracked the leaders through the turn, rallied when circling four wide turning for home, wore the leader down late in the lane and edged away at
the wire. WORKING HOLIDAY stalked the pace to the turn, bid three wide to take the lead at the quarter pole, dueled through the lane and was out-finished
late to be second best in a good effort. BROADWAY CHARM unhurried in the early going, rallied at the top of the stretch showing good late interest to be up
for the show. CITRINA set a pressured pace for a half mile and weakened through the stretch. BIG R. NAUFFAL raced mid-pack and went evenly failing to
mount a rally. XHILARATINGPURPOSE hustled up the rail to contest the early pace and came up empty. XPENSIVE PRINCESS well placed in striking
distance from two wide on the bend and lacked a response when called upon. TEST YOUR FAITH trailed as a non-factor.

I'LL FIGURE IT OUT crowded at start, reserved off pace, rallied turning for home, angled four wide in the stretch and wore his rivals down in the lane.
MUTUAL CONFIDENCE stalked the pace into the turn, made a four wide bid to engage the pacesetter turning for home, briefly took the lead at the
sixteenth pole and was caught in the final yard. APACHE trailed most of the way and closed belatedly showing good interest. FRONTLINER prompted the
pace to be well positioned and lacked a closing response. ESTILO FAVORITO set the pace on a clear lead to the quarter pole, and weakened in the stretch
drive.
