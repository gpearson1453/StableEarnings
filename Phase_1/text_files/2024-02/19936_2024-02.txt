Footnotes
KHOZALL prompted the pace in the three path, bid midway around the turn, took command while being roused and still in the three path turning into the
lane, and drew clear. LLAMARADA broke slowly and trailed in the three path, circled inner foes from the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on for
place. EVANORA stalked in the two path, tipped out to the four path under coaxing turning into lane, drifted out slightly after a left handed cue passing the
eighth pole, and evened out for show. FLUFFY raced wellback in the three path, was coaxed along in the two path around the turn, but made no impact on
her left lead in the stretch. LACE CURTAIN set the pace inside, was cued passing the three-eighths, but faded in the stretch. VINDICATE CHA CHA raced
off the pace in the six path, but never threatened from out in the eight path down the stretch. LA PICASITA chased in the five path but was empty in the two
path at the top of the lane. MUSTHAVEBEENLOVE tracked in the four path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
AMERICAN SPEED stalked the pace from the rail, tipped two wide in upper stretch, steadily gained under left-handed urging and was up late. ALEXIS
ZORBA (GB) broke a bit awkwardly, moved two wide to the lead into the first turn, set a rated pace inside and led until the final strides. JEOPARDY
THEORY saved ground off the pace, lacked an ideal path in upper stretch, angled three wide near the eighth pole and finished well. RIGEL stalked the pace
two wide and was one-paced through the lane. PALACE VIEW (IRE) went evenly while racing two and three wide. HAKKIMI (CHI) was outrun while racing
three wide. ALLEY OOP JOHNNY played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
BRODERIE stalked inside, was roused midway around the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and ran on to draw clear of an inner foe
in the final sixteenth. ATALANTA ALEXANDRA trailed in the four path, made a sweeping three wide bid midway around the turn, took the lead while floating
out to the five path at the top of the stretch, kept on while drifting in on her left lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by an outer foe before the
sixteenth to place. ADIOS BABE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the two path, bumped with another outer foe just after the five-eighths,
then lost ground while under a ride in the three path around the turn, but finished evenly in the stretch to get up for show. MINXY bumped with an inner foe
at the start, set the pace inside, was cued midway around the turn, but lost the lead while tipping out to the four path turning into the lane, and faded. CLAY
SOLDIER rated in the three path, bumped with an inner foe just after the five-eighths pole, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, but did not
threaten from the seven path in the stretch. FOXY LADY prompted the pace in the three path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
BAIL US OUT settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took over in upper stretch, dueled outside of TOUR THE
CITY through the lane and prevailed. TOUR THE CITY raced off the early pace two wide, edged closer two wide around the far turn, split rivals in upper
stretch, dueled inside of the winner through the lane and was outfinished. DOMINGO raced in range at the rail, angled out in upper stretch, could not keep
pace with the top two but stayed on to gain the show. JHIRSCH pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead nearing the quarter pole but weakened in
the lane. SUPREME DOMINANCE broke slowly, saved ground and failed to menace. WHO'S THE KING set the pace in the two path and faltered nearing
the head of the lane. RAGS SPECIAL was off slow and was outrun while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, and kicked on down the lane to hold sway. ROTTERDAM rated
inside, was coaxed passing the quarter, floated out to the nine path in upper stretch, and rallied for place. FREDO chased between foes from the two to
three paths down the backstretch, had to wait along the inside passing the quarter, but kept on from the rail in the stretch for show. SOGNO DI CAMPIONE
(CHI) prompted the pace in the three path, was roused into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. LISTENTOTHEMUSIC stalked in the two path, tipped
out to the four path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. RUSE raced off the pace in the three path, was roused in the four path midway around the
far turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but made no impact. OK BOOMER had an awkward start as the rider lost his right iron but regained it
before the first turn, trailed in the two path, fanned out to the ten path turning into the stretch, but could not threaten. IMMORTALIZATION had to steady into
the first turn, tracked in the three path down the backside, was cued while two wide into the far turn, but flattened from the six path in the stretch.

R HARPER ROSE pressed the pace while racing very wide down the backstretch, pressed in the three path around the turn, seized command near the
five-sixteenths marker and drove clear. FIONA'S MAGIC set the pace inside, was collared near the five-sixteenths marker and fought on inside to hold clear
of the rest. CHI CHI raced in range inside, tipped two wide near the quarter pole and finished evenly. SCALABLE brushed with NIKITIS at the start, raced off
the pace outside, made progress four wide around the turn but was one-paced through the lane. NIKITIS brushed with SCALABLE at the start, raced off the
pace four wide and lacked the needed rally. WITWATERSRAND bobbled at the break, chased the pace two wide and had no response.

Footnotes
FIRST WORLD WAR stalked in the three path, was cued early into the far turn, bid while still in the three path turning into the stretch, inched to the lead
nearing the sixteenth, and held sway. HAMMERSTEIN had to steady going into the first turn, tracked in the two path down the backside, was cued in the
three path midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path in upper stretch, and ran on for place. TOCAYO showed the way around the first turn to
set the pace along the inside into the backstretch, was cued in the two path turning into the stretch, and kept on, but was caught by an outer pair in the final
furlong to show. FREEDOM PRINCIPLE rated along the inside, was driven along the rail around the far turn, and finished evenly from the four path in the
stretch. EDGARTOWN laid up close along the inside, was ridden into the far turn, but flattened down the lane. QUOKKA trailed along the inside, bumped
with an outer foe turning into the stretch, and made no impact. NOTED raced off the pace in the two to three paths down the backstretch, swung out to the
six path under urging turning into lane, but was no menace. DEADPAN chased in the three path, bumped with an inner foe turning into the stretch, and
came up empty.

Footnotes
HADES broke on top, set the pace along the rail around the first turn, disputed the pace in the two path on a loose rein down the backstretch, was headed
by FIERCENESS leaving the half-mile pole, clung to that rival in the two path at a slight disadvantage around the far turn, regained command turning for
home, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and drew clear. DOMESTIC PRODUCT broke out and bumped FIERCENESS at the start then
rebounded inward and bumped DANCING GROOM soon after, rated in range inside, dropped back a bit early on the far turn, made progress at the rail late
on the bend, swung six wide in upper stretch and ran on to gain the place. FIERCENESS had his head turned at the start and broke a bit awkwardly, was
bumped by SEA STREAK and then immediately after by DOMESTIC PRODUCT, advanced four wide between foes around the first turn, disputed the pace
between rivals down the backstretch, took the lead leaving the half-mile pole, dueled in the three path around the far turn, lost the lead turning for home and
weakened through the final furlong. INVEIGLED bumped with OTELLO at the start, pressed the pace outside of the winner around the first turn, vied
between that foe and FIERCENESS down the backstretch, chased two wide around the far turn and faded in the stretch. DANCING GROOM was soundly
bumped soon after the start, trailed inside for a half, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened. OTELLO bumped with INVEIGLED at the
start, raced off the pace two and three wide and lacked a rally. SEA STREAK broke in and bumped FIERCENESS at the start, was strung out five wide
around the first turn, prompted four wide down the backstretch, chased four wide around the far turn and came up empty in the lane.
