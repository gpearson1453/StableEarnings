GODDESS OF WAR dueled with an outer rival while taking the turn in the four path, inched a narrow advantage in upper stretch and held firm while hanging
on her left lead. SWEET AND EZ dueled for the lead with an inner rival while kept in the five path by that one around the turn, and was fended off through
the lane. LA DELHOMME'S SHOW chased inside of the leaders but lacked the needed punch. GOINTOTHEGOGO quickly lost touch with the others and
was outrun.

Footnotes
CLUBHOUSE SAINT stalked along the inside, bid outside of the leader while in hand with five sixteenths to go, assumed command nearing the lane and
drew off. HOLY ZAGS laid off of the pace in the four path, ran on outside of rivals to bid for place at the sixteenth pole, vied for that position through deep
stretch and prevailed. IN THE RED tracked in the three path, chased in the four path around the far turn, bid for place between horses at the sixteenth pole,
vied with an outer rival for that position late but got outfinished. GUARDING ELK CAMP lacked speed in the two path, chased to offer a mild bid for place
along with outer rivals at the sixteenth pole, but got outkicked. GOLDEN GOPHER trailed and never got involved. LOOPY set a clear pace in the three to
two path early on, met an outer challenge around the far turn, proved no match for that bidder nearing the lane and weakened.

PRISONER stalked the clear leader from the four path, bid outside of him in the seven to eight path at the furlong grounds and drove clear. HIT THE SEAM
was briefly antsy in the starting gate, set a clear pace in the three path before shifting to the five path entering the lane, but was bested by an outer bidder in
the final furlong. BUGLER broke a step slow and checked between horses at the start, trailed outside of rivals, tucked in behind wide-floating rivals while
three furlongs go, cut the corner entering the lane and ran on to gain show in midstretch. ITALIANO chased along the inside, drifted to the five path around
the turn while floating out foes wider, entered the lane in the six path and lost show to an inner bidder at the furlong grounds. MEET JOE pursued from
midpack between horses, but got floated to the six to seven path around the turn and lacked a bid. LIE AND DENY laid off of the pace three wide, but got
floated to the seven to eight path by inner rivals around the turn and gave way.

NORTHERN COCKTAIL dueled for the lead with an outer rival, drew clear in upper stretch and held sway under driving urging. DELTA DELTA was brushed
by an inner rival at the start, tracked in the four path, ran on in the six path in the final furlong, reached place at the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the
clear leader late. FED GRANT broke outwardly and brushed a rival at the start, pursued from off of the pace in the three path and between horses and failed
to factor. OFF TO THE RACES dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, gave way in upper stretch and faded. HOT ROD JIMMY was bumped by
an inner rival at the start, chased along the inside but made little impact. WOLF'S LIFE leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, then trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NYQUILER tracked in the five to four path and outside of rivals, chased the leader while lacking progress through upper stretch, yet closed in inside the final
sixteenth, offered a late bid and forged an advantage at the wire. CHIEFS BLANKET showed the way in the two path, maintained a margin into deep
stretch, but was collared late and nailed at the wire. STREETLIGHT PEOPLE tracked along the inside, pursued under urging while within striking range
around the far turn but needed more. CLASS COMPOUNDS stalked in the three path, but chased and faded between horses at the quarter pole. AVIATOR
NATION lagged behind then improved position at the furlong grounds. CHARLIE'S MAN laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the six path
down the backstretch and made little impact. PARS AND BIRDIES pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses, dropped back with five
furlongs to go, but bore out causing his rider to lose his right iron and take an awkward hold nearing the lane, then was eased thereafter.

BLESSED ANGEL set the pace in the three path, built a clear margin around the turn and held sway. ON PURPOSE stalked outside of the leader and from
the four path while under urging around the turn, then chased that one home well to be second best. HOLY TUTTA BELLA tracked in the five path and
moved up. DORITA'S HAPPY broke out and bumped an outer rival multiple times at the start, chased along the inside, was hustled into the turn, but lacked
a bid before tiring in the final furlong and drifted out entering the final sixteenth. R SWIRVIN GIRVIN took bumps from an inner rival at the start, trailed in the
six path and failed to factor. CHIC SAMARAI laid off of the pace in the three path, failed to split horses in upper stretch and steadied at the sixteenth pole.

Footnotes
YANKEE DOLLAR stalked in the two to four path, tipped outside of the leaders and to the six path entering the lane, rallied to offer a late bid and was up in
time. KYNLIE'S EMPIRE vied for the lead with an inner rival while taking the turns in the five path, led turning for home, maintained an advantage as his
inner counterpart persisted into deep stretch, shook free of that one as an outer bidder menaced nearing the wire and got nailed. PEPPER MILL led in the
three path as an outer rival vied, got headed by that one with five sixteenths to go, fought on through midstretch, but yielded in the closing stages.
HALOSNHEAVEN transferred contact from an inner rival to an outer foe while put to cramped quarters approaching the first turn, pursued from off of the
pace in the four to five path, then ran on mildly. TIZ A MACHO GIRL broke out at the start, tracked in the four to five path, chased under urging around the
far turn before floating to the seven path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. BUSKER ALLIE bumped an outer rival early on, saved ground off of the pace,
but bore out nearing the lane carrying outer rivals wider in the process and failed to factor. DELUSIVELY steadied back when an inner rival took his path at
the start, trailed around both turns, then was forced outwardly and put to tight quarters by an inner rival entering the lane and made little impact. FINANCIAL
ADVICE (FR) was bumped by a inner rival approaching the first turn, pursued from midpack hung in the six to seven path, then tired while getting floated
wider entering the lane. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE RUNNING IN UPPER STRETCH RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL
ORDER OF FINISH. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
ELDORADO DREAM chased forwardly in the three path,, shifted down to the two path at the quarter pole, bid inside of the leaders entering the lane and
drove clear. RED NOON RISING pursued from off of the pace two wide and between horses, checked when put to tight quarters among foes at the quarter
pole, recovered and tipped out to take aim on place entering the final furlong, then edged that position late. MO CONNELLY laid off of the pace along the
inside, claimed place from outer rivals entering upper stretch, tipped out to chase the clear leader into the final furlong, but was bested for place by an outer
bidder late. LILLY CHROME bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged behind along the inside and moved up at the furlong grounds.
DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV lacked speed along the inside into the turn, shifted out to the seven path to be between horses entering the lane, but steadied
among foes at the furlong grounds, altered out and ran on. WORKIN NINETOFIVE pursued from midpack in the five path into the turn, swung out to the
eight path entering the lane and kept on mildly. LAWN DART stumbled at the start, pursued from midpack in the six path and chased between horses
through the lane. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE prompted outside of the leader and from the four path, vied around the bend before getting floated to the six
path nearing the lane, then weakened between horses. WEDDING CHAPEL stalked in the five path and between horses, then gave way. JUMPING JILL
FLASH was off awkwardly and bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, got forced wider by an inner rival nearing the lane
and made little impact. DOWNTHESTREETDEBBY set the pace inside of a vying rival while in the three path, but drifted to the five path nearing the lane
and faltered between horses. THE RIDER OF RED NOON RISING CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER FOR INTERFERECE AT THE QUARTER
POLE, BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.
