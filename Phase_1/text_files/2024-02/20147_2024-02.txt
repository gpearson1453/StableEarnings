LAST U TURN quick inside to the front, with a well rationed trip throughout to last at the wire under good handling. FAVORITE HAUNT no speed to far turn,
ran on through stretch in earnest too late. ELM STREET saved ground to far turn, kept on in the stretch for show spot. MASTERY N POLISHED no speed
from inside to far turn, ran on in the stretch, improved. VINO CALDO unhurried early, took up chasing to the stretch while on empty. ACCONA raced back
while saving ground, leveled off from far turn, bled. I FEELUCKY TONITE between horses backstretch run with no response when needed. TEN BITS slow
into stride outside while never a threat throughout. STEAL THE RHODE off rail run to far turn while close up, gave in readily stretch. BALLYCOTTON BAY
reluctant to load with brief speed from gate, gave in readily. BIG TAP saved ground to no avail throughout. KOLTEN'S PRIDE chased to the half with
nothing left and gave way readily.
