GRUMPY BAY accelerated to a clear, early lead, maintained the pace throughout, was well off the rail in the drive and held sway under encouragement. LT.
NORM bobbled at the break, chased the winner while outside that one and finished willingly. LIGHTED VESSEL broke slowly, circled the turn and rallied
mildly. TWO MORE SHOTS raced inside a rival around the turn, chased the pace and weakened. KIKIS LOVE OF LIFE , near the inner rail on the turn was
not a factor. CRUSHER chased the pace, three deep turn, faltered and was eased.

Footnotes
RESPOND took the early lead, set the pace well off the rail, dug in through the stretch while kept to his business and drifted out late. ELUSIVE LOVE , a
forward factor inside horses down the backstretch and on the far turn, moved outside the winner entering the stretch and finished willingly. MOON TIME ,
outside horses throughout, chased the winner and flattened out. BRANNIGAN , steadied on heels entering the first turn, moved to the inner rail turning for
home and failed to sustain his bid. HOT MEMORIES , four deep the first turn, failed to rally. LITTLE RED RIFLE , checked in tight quarters along the inner
rail mid way on the first turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
HIGH FASHION LADY stalked the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, advanced outside JESSICA BLAH BLAH to take entering the stretch, was
under a drive and lasted. UPTOWN RHAPSODY lacked speed, saved ground the far turn, bumped and forced out OUT OF STARS when altering course
outside the tiring JESSIC BLAH BLAH in upper stretch then rallied. HELLO BABY , three wide both turns, offered a mild, late gain outside foes. OUT OF
STARS , a forward factor near the inner rail to the far turn, eased out leaving the last bend, was bumped and forced out in upper stretch then flattened out
between horses. MEAN ELENITA , four deep the first turn, remained well of the rail until angled to the inner rail in upper stretch and failed to rally. JESSICA
BLAH BLAH opened up on the backstretch, set the pace near the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. NOSHEWONT , three wide both turns, retreated
in the stretch. Following an objection by the rider of OUT OF STARS, UPTOWN RHAPSODY was disqualified and placed fourth.

WILLY THE COBBLER , three wide both turns while stalking the pace, was floated out by BOYFRIEND MATERIAL in upper stretch, secured command in
mid stretch and drove clear. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL set the pace well off the rail down the backstretch and on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch and
gave way grudgingly. PUSH THROUGH , steadied in traffic mid way on the first turn, moved up four deep leaving the far turn and flattened out.
SIGNOFTHECROSS raced inside horses for most of the trip and weakened in the drive. HOLY EMPEROR , well positioned near the inner rail on the far
turn, angled out entering the stretch and gave way. UPO raced in the three path on both turns and failed to rally. KIRBY DERBY , near the inner rail the far
turn and in the stretch, lacked a rally. PONTI PRIDE was outrun.
