Footnotes
CITY OF ANGELS chased two wide early, coaxed along three wide on the far turn then got floated out past the quarter pole, challenged four deep in upper
stretch, dug in under left handed urging and got up at the wire. BERT'S PROSPECT rated two wide then along the rail, saved ground through the far turn
and roused at the quarter pole, moved out a bid to launch a bid between rivals in upper stretch, put a head in front the final sixteenth but got nailed by the
winner. HOT LEGS ROMOLO showed good early speed to take the front and moved inside, took pressure from outside in the middle stages, held a short
lead through the turn, shook free into the lane when outer rival drifted out, challenged by outer rivals past the eighth pole, lost command in the final sixteenth
but fought gamely to the line. ANTIBES settled off the pace then started to pull next to the fence on the clubhouse turn, chased between rivals into the
second bend, entered the lane two wide and could not rally. BE PUNCTUAL stumbled leaving the gate, raced up close three then two wide early, moved up
to apply pressure from outside on the backstretch, stayed alongside the leader on the far turn then drifted out past the quarter pole, fought three deep in
upper stretch, then weakened in the final furlong. MAXVILLE pulled between rivals early, chased three deep into the second bend, remained off the rail to
the stretch and lacked further response. HERECOMEGEORGIEBOY traveled three deep at the back around the first turn, raced four deep leaving the
backstretch, trailed three wide approaching the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ELEVADO stalked four deep into the turn, challenged outside the top pair in the four path around the bend, dueled into the final furlong and drove clear in
deep stretch. FEROCIOUSLY showed the way up the backstretch, tested by rivals around the far turn, held a short lead from the two path into the stretch,
raced on even terms with the winner at the eighth pole, lost command midstretch and stayed on to secure second. TANGLEDUPINGREY stumbled badly
leaving the gate, moved up quickly raced up close outside the pacesetter, challenged from outside in the three path around the turn, fought between rivals
into the stretch and got outkicked in the final furlong. PLAY CHICKEN stalked along the rail inside rivals into the turn, saved ground to the stretch, stayed on
the fence through the lane and lacked the needed late punch in deep stretch. SQUALOTORO trailed in range off the inside, traveled three wide into the turn,
angled out leaving the bend to enter the stretch five wide, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late. TOO MUCH INFO chased between rivals
from the two path into the turn, tipped out approaching the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
ARROGATES SPIRIT broke a step slow and got bumped leaving the gate, tugged the rider to a forward position early and took the first turn three wide, bid
outside on the second bend, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, inched ahead approaching the quarter pole, headed again by inner rival in upper stretch
and dug in through deep stretch to edge away. HARDMONEYMUCHACHOS set the pace in the two path early, challenged by ARROGATES SPIRIT on the
far turn and lost command midway around the bend, fought back on to even terms with a furlong remaining, got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch but
was clearly second best. I GOT A GUY stalked the pacesetter on the inside, moved into the two path on the far turn, could not summon the needed rally in
the stretch run but kept on to best the others. TAPIT DOWN bumped rival at the start, dropped back on the inside early, went outside a rival on the
backstretch, advanced three then four wide on the far turn but flattened out in the final furlong. RUNNING FOR COSI chased in the four path early, moved
inward while losing ground on the backstretch, trailed two then three wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. MONGOLIAN SPRING broke a step slow,
took up between rivals early then again into the first turn, started to climb between foes around that bend, chased two wide exiting the backstretch then
angled over to the rail and tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
TAMBO dueled for command inside DON'T BRING CRAZY up the backstretch and around the turn, battled through the stretch under hand urging and
edged the runner-up. DON'T BRING CRAZY dueled outside TAMBO to the top of the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch, headed again by TAMBO at the
eighth pole, fought gamely through deep stretch and was outgamed late. BEAU SOLEIL tracked in the two path, moved to the rail in upper stretch and was
along for the show. BLACKPINK (IRE) broke hair slow to begin, coaxed into range early, asked three wide around the bend and weakened in the lane. DUA
raced up close inside the top pair then chased those rivals leaving the backstretch, roused along the rail on the turn, came off the fence in upper stretch and
weakened. HATTIE T trailed on the inside into the turn, eased off the rail and raced two to three wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MAHINA broke a step slow, settled inside, angled out with a quarter mile remaining, steered out further at the top of the lane, rallied to the front outside the
eighth pole and won going away. ADELIE (IRE) stalked in the two path, tipped out into the lane, launched a bid in upper stretch but was no match for the
winner late. NO WAY IT'S TODAY (GB) stalked along the inside through both turns, remained on the fence in the lane and got up for third.
WEEMISSGRAMMY grabbed the early lead and moved to the rail, overtaken by SUNGLASSES (GB) and dueled up the backstretch, put a head in front on
the far turn, lost command in upper stretch, flattened in deep stretch and lost the show. SUNGLASSES (GB) broke a step slow, started to pull behind rivals,
continued to be a handful on the first turn and was guided out to the three path, tugged the rider forward and drew alongside the leader eventually taking
over on the backstretch, dueled from outside around the far turn while losing command midway around the bend, fought to upper stretch and weakened in
the furlong grounds. WARRIOR LADY stalked three deep into the first turn then got brushed and pushed out to the four path by SUNGLASSES (GB) on the
first turn, trailed two wide then on the fence on the second bend and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
E J WON THE CUP dueled from outside, inched ahead on the backstretch, cleared DE' MEDICI with three furlongs left to run, showed the way into deep
stretch and held well. DE' MEDICI dueled from inside, saw the leader inch ahead in the middle stages, pressed again nearing the far turn, lost touch at the
three-eighths pole, came off the rail and was driven two wide into the lane, finished gamely through deep stretch but lacked the needed late punch to get by
the winner. MONGOLIAN CHAMP chased in the three path early, split rivals to move into range on the backstretch, ridden along two then three wide on the
far turn and lacked a late bid. DADDY JUSTIFY stalked four wide then outside a pair of rivals on the first turn, took the second turn three then four wide and
weakened in the stretch. WINSITWELL tracked four wide early, chased three then two wide on the second bend and failed to menace. MONGOLIAN MAX
stalked inside rivals along the rail early, lost ground on the far turn, cut the corner into the drive and came up empty. SINFUL KING stalked two wide then
between rivals on the first turn, chased outside a rival exiting the backstretch, dropped back around the second bend, eased in the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
TIGERHON (FR) raced in range up the backstretch, entered the turn along the rail, eased out to the three path leaving the bend, moved out further to
challenge with a furlong remaining, headed GYPSY KING at the sixteenth pole and drew clear under urging. GYPSY KING showed early speed outside the
top pair then remained close up the backstretch, bid three deep on the turn, took over in upper stretch, clung to a narrow lead at the sixteenth pole and
yielded late. INCREDIBLE SHOT settled near the back, rounded the bend two then three wide, moved out in the lane and got up for third. THE BULLION
BOMBER (IRE) dueled for command from outside, inched ahead at the quarter pole, was overtaken in upper stretch and flattened in deep stretch. EREBUS
chased three deep off the pace, gained some ground three then two wide on the turn but lacked a rally in the stretch. KIMMER broke a step slow, chased off
the pace between rivals, rounded the bend in the two path and lacked the needed response. TRUSTY RUSTY raced in mid-pack inside pair of rivals early,
saved ground through the turn, cornered nicely into the stretch and also lacked a response when called upon. BRUTTO went up to duel from inside, fought
inside rivals on the turn, yielded in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. BARSABAS came away cleanly but lacked early speed and dropped far
back, trailed on the inside through the turn and could not make an impact.

Footnotes
IRISH WAHINE stalked up the backstretch, chased between rivals in the two path then three wide leaving the bend, started to rally under left handed urging
but had the rider lose his whip outside the eighth pole, drew alongside the leader midstretch and proved best under hand urging. ELTONSINGSANOTHER
set the pace under pressure from outer rival up the backstretch and around the turn, shook free at the top of the lane, confronted by IRISH WAHINE
midstretch and got outkicked in the final sixteenth. UNCONTROLLABLE settled along the inside, left the turn in the two path, moved back inside and
finished well along the fence for a game third. BELLA RENELLA stalked from inside, asked right handed at the top of the stretch and lacked late punch.
DIAMONDS DANZING chased wide up the backstretch, four deep on the turn, put to left handed urging the lane and failed to produce a bid. STAY IN LINE
forwardly placed three deep into the turn, roused three wide around the bend, moved out in the lane and weakened. SHANGHAI SUNRISE hustled along
early, pressed the pace from outside, stayed alongside through the turn, then failed to kick on with the leader at the top of the stretch and weakened in the
final furlong. WISHTHEYALLCOULDBE antsy in the gate, came away slow on the outside, trailed four wide around the bend, tipped out in the lane and
could not make an impact.

Footnotes
DICK BEST took control early in the two path then moved inside, got pressured from outside on the backstretch, cleared approaching the five-sixteenths
pole, tested from outside again in upper stretch, drifted in a bit to bother BARELY FUNTIONAL midstretch, clung to a narrow lead with a sixteenth left to run
and gamely prevailed. BARELY FUNTIONAL brushed in the beginning, settled three deep on the first turn, had to take hold when running up on heels
approaching the five-eighths pole, moved inside approaching the far turn, made progress while saving ground, looked to bid inside DICK BEST past the
eighth pole but got put in tight briefly, gained a clear path and was put to right handed urging, finished gamely along the fence and missed. TOM AND
JAZZY chased four deep into the first turn then dropped back and steered to the inside, went two wide into the far turn, angled out and exited the bend four
wide, moved out further in the lane, closed well outside the top trio and got up for third. RODRIGOKNOWS raced up close three then two wide, applied
pressure to the pacesetter in the middle stages, lost touch with that rival near the five-sixteenths pole, remained closest in pursuit two wide into the stretch,
re-bid from outside with a furlong remaining, fought three deep in deep stretch and got edged for the show honors. MOOGIE SON trailed from the rail into
the first turn, passed rivals on the backstretch, came off the rail on the far turn and spun three wide into the lane, steered out in the stretch and summoned a
mild rally. WINE AND WHISKY chased five then four wide on the first turn, spun three wide into the stretch and finished evenly late. DRUIDIC raced keenly
early then stalked between rivals in the two path, coaxed along into the backstretch, lost ground on the far turn and kept on through the lane while unable to
threaten. BILLY'S BET stalked the pace from inside, tipped out with a quarter mile remaining and lacked a bid. MOGOLLON RIM brushed with outer rival at
the start, raced along the inside towards the rear into the first turn, moved off the rail on the backstretch, rounded the far turn along the fence then two wide
leaving the bend and failed to menace. BRONKO NAGURSKI brushed between rivals leaving the gate, traveled outside a rival near the back then trailed
outside a foe, lagged behind in the middle stages, came out in upper stretch and had little left for the drive. DAZZLE THE COMMAND chased four then
three wide on the first turn, continued along those paths out of range on the second bend and came up empty. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED DICK BEST FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR SHIFTING IN AND PUTTING BARELY FUNTIONAL IN TIGHT ALONG THE
RAIL IN MIDSTRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
