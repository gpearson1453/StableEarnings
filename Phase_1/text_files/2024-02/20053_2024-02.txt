Footnotes
BELLE EPOQUE grabbed the early lead then dueled inside WE'LL DO IT LIVE up the backstretch, inched head into the turn, shook free at the top of the
lane and held under hand urging. SUGAR FISH sat off the pace, advanced two wide between rivals midway on the turn then spun three wide into the lane,
rallied through the stretch and kept gaining to the wire. WE'LL DO IT LIVE stumbled leaving the gate, went up to challenge from outside for command, kept
the pressure on through the turn, could not kick on with the winner in upper stretch and flattened to third. NANCI GRIFFITH broke a step slow, trailed a bit
off the rail into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and improved position. ELEVEN OUT OF TEN chased the top pair three wide into the turn, lost
ground around the bend, raced in the four path turning for home and weakened down the lane. JAZZY EMPRESS coaxed along early chasing from inside,
also lost ground to the leaders on the turn, exited the bend two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG RAINBOW broke well and was hustled along early chasing the leaders to the turn, launched a bid along the fence at the five-sixteenths pole, quickly
took over, put away outer rivals with a quarter mile remaining and drew off under urging. MISS MICHE LADA broke a step slow then was sent for the front,
set the pace under pressure from DONITA ROSE two wide into the turn, challenged by the winner at the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead
approaching the quarter pole, chased after BIG RAINBOW a bit off the rail into the lane and bested the rest. DONITA ROSE prompted the pace from
outside, fought three deep nearing the quarter pole, chased after the new leader leaving the bend and churned on to hold third. HEADED FOR OM stalked
from outside, under urging four deep at the quarter pole and weakened in the late stages. STAY UP traveled in the second flight up the backstretch,
navigated the turn five then four wide and failed to menace. CAT ON THE RUN broke a bit slow, chased under coaxing at the back, rounded the bend along
the rail then came two wide into the drive and failed to make an impact. CLUB RIBBON raced outside a rivals well off the rail at the back early on, took the
turn six then five wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) brushed with outer rival early, rated along the fence, chased two wide into the lane, bid three deep in upper stretch, gained
command outside the sixteenth pole and inched away from the runner-up. ANKYRAH showed early speed then stalked in the two path around the
clubhouse turn, tossed his head from the five-eighths pole to the nine-sixteenths marker before settling back down, dueled from outside around the far turn,
inched ahead in upper stretch, fought with NORTH EAST STAR (IRE) in the furlong grounds but was outkicked in the final sixteenth. DOLLY MAY (IRE) got
squeezed back early, saved ground off the pace then moved into range in the middle stages, coaxed along at the quarter pole, moved out a bit in upper
stretch and finished willingly for the show honors. LEOPARDESS (GB) trailed in the two path to the far turn, moved to the inside on the second bend, came
out and lacked room when crowded a bit in upper stretch, then kept on for a minor award once given a clear path. ZZYZX established the front then steered
to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch, dueled around the far turn, lost command at the top of the lane and weakened along the fence. DE JORIA
stalked outside a pair of rivals, put in a mild bid at the three-eighths pole but failed to keep touch with the top pair around the far turn, chased three wide into
the lane and flattened out. YVETT'S SURPRISE had to take up briefly behind the leader early, stalked between rivals around the clubhouse turn, chased
outside a rival on the far turn then three wide entering the stretch and weakened.

BIG POP vied four deep up the backstretch, fought three deep early on the turn, dueled outside CHASING KAT past the five-sixteenths pole, put a nose in
front at the sixteenth pole and edged away late. CHASING KAT vied for the lead between rivals, moved over to the rail early on the bend, dueled with BIG
POP down the lane, lost the advantage in deep stretch and kept on gamely to the wire. ROBERTA'S LOVE brushed and floated in early, climbed a bit
chasing off the inside up the backstretch, went three wide around the turn, finished willingly and whittle the gap on the winner late. BE A GOLDFISH
steadied when bothered by ROBERTA'S LVOE early, trailed along the fence into the turn, angled out to the three path around the bend and passed tired
rivals. REALLY THIRSTY vied for the lead inside rivals up the backstretch, could not keep pace into the turn, asked right handed leaving the bend and
weakened along the fence. EASTER COMING BACK vied three deep to the turn, between rivals to the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the drive
and faded. THE FENCE chased the early leaders from outside, dropped back two wide around the bend and tired.

RUFF RIDE traveled in the two path at the back outside a rival early, went three wide into the far turn, altered in from behind a weakening rival at the
three-eighths pole, angled out widest with a furlong remaining, rallied four deep in the final sixteenth and got up near the wire. ABHITA unhurried in the
beginning moved inside, tipped to the two path on the far turn while going between rivals, moved out in upper stretch, rallied under left then right handed
urging, led briefly late and got overtaken by the winner in the closing moments. JESSEBEAR stalked on the inside, moved into range on the backstretch,
urged two wide on the second bend, rallied between rivals in the final sixteenth but got outkicked by the top pair. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS took the early
lead and moved into the two path then along the inside while opening up a comfortable advantage, held a diminished lead into the far turn, showed the way
along the fence into the drive, led clear into deep stretch and yielded late. TURIAF settled between rivals, moved closer up the fence in the middle stages,
lost some ground on the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and flattened in the late stages. SENSIBLE MOVE tracked three deep, exiting the
backstretch, rounded the far turn two then three wide and faded out of contention. ROMAN EMPRESS stalked the leader in the three path on the first turn,
dropped back three then two wide under coaxing on the far turn and tired.

TWO BY FOUR broke a bit slow and inward, lagged behind up the backstretch, made progress along the fence through the turn, rallied up the rail in the
stretch and got up in the closing moments. KNOWN IDEA cleared briefly then crossed over, soon pressure by a pair of rivals to the outside, moved clear
once more entering the turn, asked right handed into the stretch, led clear into the final furlong, met the challenge from J DUTTON midstretch, resisted that
rival through the final sixteenth but could not fence off the late run from the winner on the inside. J DUTTON chased along the rail into the turn, tipped two
wide nearing the quarter pole, drew alongside KNOWN IDEA in midstretch and lacked the needed final kick to get by. UNCLE CHILLY chased two wide
leaving the backstretch, moved out around the bend and spun four wide turning for home, kept to task through the lane and put in a mild late bid to close the
gap. VODKA VODKA chased briefly then went up to press the pace from outside, could not keep touch with the leader into the turn, chased three then four
wide around the bend and weakened in the drive. CODY BOY raced up close three deep, chased after the leader leaving the backstretch, dropped back
three then four wide on the turn, eased in the lane and walked off.

FIRST PEACE closest in pursuit early while getting brushed from outside, angled into the two path early on the bend then took aim three wide from outside,
bid three deep past the quarter pole, got floated out across the dirt, fought outside BEEF WINSLOW through the final furlong and dug in late to edge his
stablemate. BEEF WINSLOW paused briefly early stalking the pace, moved to the rail for the turn, challenged from inside past the quarter pole, took over
crossing the dirt, held a short lead over FIRST PEACE through the lane and yielded grudgingly in the end. MAS RAPIDO (GB) chased between rivals early
then got put in tight and had to steady, rounded the bend two wide, angled out approaching the stretch and gained the show honors. LOVESICK BLUES
trailed on the inside into the turn, came off the rail a bit around the bend, found the fence again at the top of the lane, moved out once more and kept on to
round out the superfecta. NABOKOV stepped to the front quickly, angled in entering the turn, drifted out crossing over the dirt and lost command in the
process, then weakened down the lane. PANIC ALARM (IRE) brushed the gate to lose a step, traveled near the back in the early going, raced along the rail
then two wide on the turn, moved out and came four wide into the stretch and failed to menace. REIQUIST saved ground along the inside and failed to
respond when called upon. DONCIC chased from outside, brushed with rival and got put in tight along the outer rail early, continued in range three to four
wide on the turn, drifted out crossing the dirt and faded.

Footnotes
SHARP AZA TACK stalked the top pair up the backstretch, challenged three deep at the quarter pole, cleared in upper stretch and stayed strong to the wire
despite drifting out. MATANZAS CREEK broke a step slow and bumped inner rival, settled off the pace outside a rival early then drew closer leaving the
backstretch, chased two wide before angling out at the quarter pole, loomed four wide into the stretch and could not find the needed final kick in deep
stretch. TARANTINO traveled off the pace two wide into the turn, angled out past the quarter pole, rallied from the middle portion of the track and got up for
third. WILL BE dueled inside GOOD VIBES only for command, fought with a pair of outer rivals past the quarter pole, stayed on to upper stretch, lost touch
with the winner at the eighth pole and got outkicked for the place and show. GOOD VIBES ONLY dueled outside WILL BE up the backstretch, fought
between rivals at the quarter pole, then weakened down the lane. MOR TEQUILA bumped with outer rival leaving the gate, chased four wide into the turn,
moved into the three path around the bend, came back out to enter the lane five wide and faded. DOUSEAWHATISEA stumbled leaving the gate, trailed
four wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
MEGA MOON showed the way early and moved inside, pressured leaving the clubhouse turn, raced on even terms with outer rival on the backstretch, held
a slim margin over outer foes through the far turn, inched clear from SMOOTH SALUTE in upper stretch and held gamely to the wire. SMOOTH SALUTE
pulled first time through the stretch chasing outside a rival, advanced four deep in the middle stages, bid three deep exiting the backstretch, fought outside
rivals into the lane, outkicked by the winner in the final furlong and stayed on to hold second. LAHAINA FLAVOR brushed with inner rival at the start,
traveled two wide towards the rear, rounded the far turn two then three wide, closed well through the lane and missed the place. AUTOLINE (IRE) stalked
from inside, drew closer between rivals on the backstretch, continued to give chase between foes in the two path on the far turn, tipped out into the lane and
finished well. NUMERO DIX (GB) took a bump leaving the gate, unhurried in the early going and cut across to the inside, came under a ride still trailing on
the far turn, entered the lane two wide, angled out in upper stretch and showed late effort while unable to threaten. CRYPTO MAN bumped at the start,
raced near the back on the inside, inched closer on the backstretch but ran up on heels past the half-mile pole, saved ground through the far turn, tipped out
in upper stretch and lacked a rally. REMOTE bumped with outer rival in the beginning, moved forward into a stalking position three deep first time through
the stretch, drew alongside the leader leaving the clubhouse turn, moved up on even terms on the backstretch, roused while fighting between foes on the
second bend, then weakened in the stretch run. GOLD COUNCIL broke out and bumped rival, rated in the two path between foes early, chased three deep
into the far turn, angled out leaving that bend but weakened down the lane. SANGER bumped leaving the gate, pulled hard and became rank chasing
behind the leader on the fence early, stalked into the far turn, coaxed along the rail but came up empty.
