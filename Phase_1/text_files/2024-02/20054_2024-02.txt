Footnotes
IFFY ASSET CLASS got away alertly, set the early tempo racing off the rail, exchanged a light brush heading into the turn pressured by an outside foe,
drifted eight deep turning into upper stretch, fended off an outside challenger and held an inside foe at bay digging in to prevail under steady urging.
KAMMYS KASH chased from between runners two wide off the leading pair, moved nearer the rail at the quarter pole cutting the corner and gaining on the
eventual winner, could not match strides with that one but was second best. BALD IS BEAUTIFUL was just a bit reluctant to load, caught wide into the turn,
moved five deep to commence a bid coming past the quarter pole, was floated nine wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. TOMMY'S UP
chased from inside after breaking just a bit awkwardly, came out past the quarter, was one-paced. SLOWDOWNTOGOFAST chased from between foes at
the back, was mostly four to five wide, failed to rally. SUMMER PUDDING bobbled ever so slightly in the early going, prompted the pace from outside
exchanging a very light brush into the turn, was floated ten deep out of that bend, tired.

Footnotes
MAGIC MOSCO was under a hold early rating just off the pace stalking outside, moved to challenge while being floated ten wide into upper stretch, drew
clear late. LET THERE BE PEACE pulled to the lead from between runners after about the opening quarter, set the lead pressured by an outside foe, drifted
about nine wide turning for home, was outkicked. BIG LEAGUE BENNY soon led while in hand racing inside but off the fence, was overtaken near the
nine-sixteenths, continued to chase from inside, saved ground on the turn, went evenly. SILVER DADDY chased from the rear racing near but off the rail,
failed to menace. WILLTOBELUCKY was encouraged along from the five-sixteenths chasing in pursuit outside a foe and not far off the leaders, faded in the
stretch.

rally. VODKA TWIST lightly bumped a rival at the start, raced off the inside at the back, floated nine deep leaving the turn, failed to threaten. LOTTA GUSTO

STORM IN THE VALLE attended from outside mostly four to six wide, asked for more at the quarter pole, took command and drew away in the stretch.
CHIPZ quickly took the early lead, set a pressured pace, was between foes two to three deep coming to the quarter pole, lugged out a bit in the stretch, was
no match for the winner but fought on to get the place. QUEEN HADASSAH tracked in behind, bid up the inside coming to the quarter pole, had no extra for
the drive. JUST KEEP LAUGHIN lacked early speed racing inside, came out for the drive and ran on. WILDCAT REESE chased from outside four to seven
wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
LET EM RIP set the early pace from between runners, went two to three wide on the turn, turned back challengers and dug in to prevail under steady
urging. RAPPING RUMOR was a little fractious in the gate, attended stalking from outside, edged nearer the leader three to four wide on the turn making a
bid between foes at the quarter pole, lugged out near the sixteenth pole, was turned away but second best. HARDY BOY advanced outside willingly four to
five wide on the turn, bid at the quarter pole, was carried out near the sixteenth pole while starting to weaken and could not sustain the effort. COMFORT J
BYRD settled off the inside and off the leaders, moved out swinging seven wide and asked for more by the quarter pole, finished up willingly to be best of
the rest. TAZ MARKING was fractious in the gate, forwardly-positioned between runners just off the early lead, dropped back and continued to chase from
off the rail, angled six wide turning for home, drifted in a bit soon after, failed to rally. ETHAN broke a step slowly and lacked early speed despite
encouragement, was not a threat. MORE MONEY pressed briefly from inside, dropped back and faded. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
STRETCH RUN NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

WHERES BRAYDEN stalked from outside four wide, moved to challenge taking the lead at the quarter pole while drifting about seven deep into upper
stretch then lugged in a bit while clear, extended the margin under urging and held safe. STORMIN FAST settled off the pace, swung seven deep into upper
stretch, was second best. STYLE BENDER pressed from between runners, bid past the three-eighths, came out a bit in upper stretch, weakened but kept
on to preserve show honors. HOLLYWOOD TIZ was caught wide outside a foe at the rear into the turn four deep fanning six wide into upper stretch, needed
more. LIL LATIGO attended three wide between runners, bid past the three-eighths, weakened in the stretch. MAJORWAYHOME had the early lead inside
but thoroughly pressured by outside foes, weakened.

ROCKIN MARIE exchanged light contact at the start, quickly moved clear setting the pace racing well off the rail, drifted out a bit further leaving the turn,
held sway under steady but moderate urging. WILLSHERWONTSHE advanced outside on the leader five to seven wide on the turn, was no match but
second best. FOR FUN settled in behind the leading pair racing off the fence, moved out from two to four wide late on the turn beginning to advance, kept
on for show honors but was no late threat to the top pair. SIERRA SUMMER broke a step slowly, raced near but off the fence, ran on. GRAN MANNA
pressed the eventual winner into the turn racing four deep, came out eight wide into upper stretch, failed to rally. LA DIAMANT broke outwardly, lacked early
speed, shifted in on the turn, was not a threat. TIZ FOR REAL bumped lightly with a foe at the start, raced off the pace inside, swung nine wide into upper
stretch, was not a factor.

KAYE pressed from outside four wide into the turn, dueled from the top of the stretch, inched away late. ART CURATOR attended from between runners
three wide into the turn, took the lead into that bend, dueled inside a runner through upper and mid-stretch but was outfinished. SWEET BUT FIERCE was
encouraged forward advancing on the leaders outside five wide on the turn, was within range coming to the top of the stretch but flattened out. MI
PRINCESA was forced in at the start, pressed from between runners, dropped back passing the seven-sixteenths, kept on but needed more. MUSICAL
MONEY veered out at the start, raced six wide into the turn fanning eight wide into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest. PEPPERS RAMPAGE broke
inwardly, raced a bit erratic in behind runners early, swung seven wide into upper stretch, came in at that point, was never near enough to threaten. MOON
PIE MONEY was outpaced early racing inside, came out a bit for the drive, was not a threat. GOGETEMGRACIE was coaxed forward to the lead to set the
pace, vied inside foes, weakened.

Footnotes
SPEED BUMP BOB prompted the pace, dueled outside with a narrow advantage three to four wide on the turn into upper stretch, forged clear. ATTILAS
TORNADO set a pressured pace between foes then dueled inside the winner but off the fence, proved no match but held second. MAXIMUM BULL chased
in behind two to three wide, kept on late but just missed place. MIST N SEVEN chased from mid-pack and outside going five to six wide on the turn, swung
out nine deep into upper stretch, kept on for a minor award. HENNESSY LOOKER RF broke just a half-step slowly, was coaxed forward inside within range
of the leaders, dropped back but kept on evenly. DEACON BEACON stalked just off the leaders going four to five wide on the turn, had no late bid.
FORWARD OBSERVER was off the inside and off the leaders racing in the four path into the turn, swung nine wide into upper stretch, was never near
enough to threaten. NOGAL CANYON unhurriedly brought up the rear racing off the inside, was not a threat.
