Footnotes
MOONSAFE stalked the early pace three wide, then made a bid between rivals nearing the furlong marker, hit the front and was clear by the sixteenth
marker and then maintained a safe margin to the wire to prove best, driving. GOLDEN EIB MICRPHN was well placed along the inside, angled out for racing
room nearing the sixteenth marker and finished well. SEEKING THE DREAM set the pace while in the two path, then turned back a bid at the quarter pole
and was clear off the turn but then faded in the final furlong, held show award. NO EASY ANSWER was well rated early, swung out four wide leaving the
turn, then shifted back in nearing the furlong marker and had a late rally to just miss the show award. TERPEYE was off a step slow and showed no speed,
saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. MORGANS COVE was reserved early and lacked a serious rally.
BOWTOTHEQUEEN was off slowly, then made a four wide move on the turn to loom boldly by the quarter pole but came up empty in the final furlong. MRS
BELL chased the early pace, four wide on the turn and weakened.

CLOUD MUSIC was away alertly to set the early pace, was well handled and then was challenged nearing the furlong marker but turned back that bid and
drew away to prove best under left handed crop urging. LAKE NAKURU was rated along four to three deep, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and
loomed boldly by the furlong marker but flattened out, clearly second best. MOON WARRIOR was settled two wide early, made a mild advance four wide by
the quarter poler and then held the show award late. MORE THAN A DANCE was reserved early, two wide on the far turn and had no rally.
TEMPESTUOUS was four wide into the first turn, settled on the outside and tired. ESPRESSO LUNGO prompted the winner early three wide, two wide on
the far turn and tired. DEVOTED KITTEN was reserved early on the inside and failed to menace. FORECLOSURE chased the pace on the inside and tired.

SUGAR'S LAST HOPE broke outwardly at the start, then stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole to go on even terms, then
gained command four wide off the turn and then held sway late to prove best under a drive. NIGHTSCAPE dueled for the lead two wide outside a rival, then
got the better of that rival but was confronted by the winner to the outside, then fought on gamely to the wire but was outfinished. TAKE THE PLEDGE was
off slowly, advanced on the inside on the turn, then swung out three wide leaving the turn to make a bid between rivals nearing the furlong marker but hung.
MAT MATTERS was bumped at the start, then settled early, advanced three wide on the turn and swung out five wide leaving the turn, then lugged in by the
furlong marker and flattened out. MALIBU'S BOSS MAN was reserved early, four wide by the quarter pole but had no rally. TACTICAL HUMOR broke in
and bumped a rival at the start, then dueled for the lead on the inside and stopped in the drive.
