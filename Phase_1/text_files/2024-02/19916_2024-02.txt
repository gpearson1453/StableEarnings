Footnotes
ARMY OF THOUGHTS coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside shaking away midway on the turn, continued just off the inside into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive growing leg weary inside the final furlong and coming under threat to the outside and held on to prevail. PRACTICAL
MISS chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide
into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily whittling away at the leader but missed at the end. MONTAUK MYSTIQUE coaxed from the start, chased
three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on one paced through to the finish. MAXING THE BANK chased
four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened. DREAM ON CARA chased five to six wide coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch, tired. PUREST PERFORMANCE five wide in pursuit, got coaxed along three
furlongs from home, tipped six to seven wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
SWEETEST PRINCESS moved closer with five furlongs to run then was well placed, drafted in the two path on the turn, was asked while espying a seam
between foes into upper stretch, gained between horses to make a bid inside the three-sixteenths, drifted out under a left-handed crop while taking the
advantage near the furlong marker then switched to a right-handed crop and moved clear under steady urging. FRAU DIABLO bumped with a rival at the
start then bobbled ever so slightly, disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, was asked while inside on the turn, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and was outfinished while able to hold the place. RISK FREE made light contact with a foe at the start then was grabbed with the left-rein while in
tight and dropped back, angled to the outside, settled outside under some urging, was ridden along in the six path on the turn, remained on her inside lead
in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. FANCY AZTECA was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside then in
the three path on the turn, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. TO A T bumped lightly with a foe at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along in
the three path on the turn and failed to rally. DAME CINCO tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, chased into the stretch
and came up empty. GOLDEN ROCKET bumped with a rival at the start, moved out then was coaxed along on the outside, chased late on the backstretch,
pursued the leaders in the five path on the turn and capitulated.

Footnotes
KANT BEAT THE ROCK shied out at the start and came under coaxing, chased five then four wide down the backstretch before tucking three wide through
the turn getting placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out five to six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive issuing a challenge to take
command a sixteenth from home, then edged clear to the finish. LITTLE LUCA broke out at the start and came under coaxing, raced four then three wide
forwardly placed before advancing tucked to the two path to duel through the turn with TALKIN PHAROAH to the inside, took over narrow command and
swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat from flanking rivals and was collared a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors. BAD
LARRY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. STREET SWAGG coaxed from the start, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled out six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. TALKIN PHAROAH showed the way in hand three then two wide
before being engaged in a duel when tucked along the inside through the turn, got coaxed along with five-sixteenths to go, spun two to three wide for home
and weakened in the late stages. NECROMANCER chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled seven wide into upper
stretch, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
AMEDEUS MUSIC broke a step slow then dropped back, moved out while urged along well off the pace, gained in the five path on the turn, rallied six wide
into the stretch, closed well to get the lead near the furlong marker then drew away under steady urging. GHOSTLYPRINCE settled off the pace, moved
closer near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, gained along the rail to make a bid inside the five-sixteenths pole, took the lead approaching the
quarter-pole, spun three wide into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner near the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the place.
JOKING WAY stalked the pace on the outside, chased in the five path on the turn, made a bid outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive into the final
furlong and tired while able to get the show. RUNGIUS was coaxed along while attending the pace then chased the leader, pursued that foe in the three
path on the turn, dropped back near the five-sixteenths, moved out around the furlong marker and weakened. LIFE AND LIGHT broke out at the start, was
urged along at the rear, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, went two to three wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.
MAGNOLIA MIDNIGHT was hustled to the front, showed the way while well off the inside, vied in the two path on the turn, was given his cue near the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage approaching the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch and gave way. KHAFRE raced just off the pace between
foes, chased in the four path on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated.

Footnotes
LISTENTOYOURHEART showed the way in hand six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn, shook away and
went five to six wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, dug in under threat to the inside and got directed in to look his main danger in the eye gamely
fending off the rival to prevail. MIDLANER coaxed from the start, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the stretch, fought on through
to the finish but was ultimately rebuffed at the end. POWER SEEKER coaxed from the gate, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch and
then four wide through the turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide for home, weakened in the late stages. LIFE CHANGER
coaxed from the start, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking four wide through the turn, got coaxed along three furlongs
from home, tipped five wide at the head of the stretch and weakened. LORD CAPTAIN coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside and then along the
inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, made no impact. JAKE ROCKS chased five to six paths off
the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home and tired.

Footnotes
I GOT BUSTED moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the three then two path on the turn,
responded well when asked for his best in upper stretch, drew off under the crop until near the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the
finish while much the best. COMPUTE IT chased the pace, went two to three wide for most of the turn then shifted to the four path, remained on his inside
lead in the stretch and earned the place while no match for the winner. WITHIN VIEW leaned out and broke a half-step slow, was urged along at the back,
saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was along for the show. SOLO TONIGHT was urged along off the pace, raced in the two path
early on the turn, shifted four then five wide starting near the three-eighths pole, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response.
MANNY PENNY was off slow then dropped back, went five then six wide on the turn and failed to threaten. MAMA'S DREAM chased the pace, moved in to
save ground on the turn and tired. PROFITABILITY chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn and also tired. IRIE MAN was
ridden along off the pace, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to respond. FINANCIER was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn
and also failed to respond.
