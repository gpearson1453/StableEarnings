Footnotes
MISS FASHIONISTA was bumped soundly at the start then forced into another foe, dropped back some while corrected with the left-rein, moved out early
then settled on the outside, was roused in the three to four path on the turn, rallied outside to get the lead into upper stretch, drifted in while moving clear
under one pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker and drew away under a strong hand-ride from that point to the finish. MALU was coaxed to
the front, showed the way with some company to her outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and
proved no match while clear for the place. ACCELERINA bumped soundly with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside on the
turn and tired while clear for the show. THE SPLENDID ONE stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the two to three path on the turn, dropped back
coming to the quarter-pole and capitulated. PUREST PERFORMANCE veered out at the start and bumped with a foe then was checked, spotted the front a
few lengths, settled at the rear, was urged along late on the backstretch, moved from the two path to the four path on the turn and failed to respond.

SHESALITTLE EDGY was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked under threat outside the
five-sixteenths pole, dueled with the runner-up under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, disposed of that foe outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best
under steady handling. REMAIN ANONYMOUS was well spotted just off the pace, gained to make a bid leaving the backstretch, vied in the three path while
outside of the winner on the turn, drew even outside the five-sixteenths pole, dueled under the crop in upper stretch, lost touch with the winner into the final
sixteenth and was outfinished while clear for the place. MURSAL chased the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path and lacked the needed response. HAZARDOUS HUMOR settled at the rear of the field, was urged along in the three path on the turn and failed to
rally. COLLECT DATTT chased the pace on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn and tired.

DAME CATHERINE vied three wide with a pair of rivals, came under coaxing at the three-eighths when KHALI'S STORM advanced outside, emerged with
that rival from among a quarter to duel through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took over command inside the
three-sixteenths and edged clear under a drive to prevail. AWESOME GLO broke out at the start bumping WILD MAGIC, vied inside a pair of rivals and
advanced to take narrow and brief command half a mile from home, got headed once more at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and ran on to come again and secure the place honors. KHALI'S STORM chased four wide, commenced
a bid at the three-eighths and emerged to duel with DAME CATHERINE to the inside through the latter portion of the turn holding a narrow lead, swung
three wide for home, got displaced inside the three-sixteenths and weakened in the late stages while clear of the rest. DACTILOGRAFA chased just off the
inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, took to the rail straightened away
and weakened. HOLDER CLOSE chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at

between foes, got headed at the half mile pole, advanced to take back the front at the seven-sixteenths placed to coaxing, faded inside the three-eighths
and swung three wide at the head of the stretch, then faltered through to the finish.

Footnotes
JOEY THE FISH was forced out some while last away, dropped back quickly while showing no speed, fell well behind the rest of the field under urging, went
around the turn in the two path, moved out while rallying in the final furlong and closed strongly to get up in the final strides. TRY IT AGAIN moved in while
showing speed, contested the pace, vied between horses into the turn, went around that bend in the two path, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths,
led into the stretch, inched away under the crop into the final furlong, was clear into the last sixteenth, led until the final strides but was denied while able to
hold the place. MEMENTO MI was urged along on the inside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, dropped well back while shifting from the rail to the
three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, found her best stride in the final furlong and finished with late energy to garner the show.
SHOOPTHEREITIS settled off the pace, moved closer with five furlongs to run, raced between foes leaving the backstretch, was urged along in the two path
for most of the turn then dropped to the inside, angled out behind horses inside the three-sixteenths pole and finished willingly to get the last spot in the
superfecta. MAGGIE bumped with a rival at the start, raced just off the pace, was asked while in the three path for most of the turn then dropped to the two
path, chased in upper stretch, jostled with an opponent near the furlong marker and was outfinished. JACKSON AVENUE disputed the pace on the outside,
chased in the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, jostled with a foe near the furlong marker and tired. MAGGIE T disputed the
pace on the inside of rivals, vied along the rail on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened. VAX broke
out and bumped with a rival, raced just off the pace, moved up with five furlongs to run then disputed the pace, vied in the three path while asked on the turn
and came up empty. SIMPLE SUGAR was fractious in the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, went four then five
wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and capitulated.

and missed at the end. CONNIVING seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, got paused off the heels of DON VINO VICI before spinning three wide into upper stretch, then kept on to secure the show honors. SKYLER'S

Footnotes
WHAT'S UP BRO moved up to contest the pace, went clear coming to the half-mile pole, controlled the action in the two path on the turn, responded well
when asked at the quarter-pole, came under a right-handed crop near the furlong marker, remained under the crop into the final sixteenth and proved much
the best under a hand-ride from that point to the finish. BE THE BOSS was well placed just off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved
ground under urging on the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and willingly earned the place while no match for the winner. TEN CENT TOWN was sent
hard to the early lead, lost the advantage to the winner before the nine-sixteenths, dropped back with a half-mile to run, chased inside for most of the turn,
shifted two then three wide late on that bend, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. BIG
ENGINE dropped back early then was urged along towards the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn and improved position. JEMOGRAPHY tracked
the pace on the outside, chased three to four wide on the turn and tired. THE INSTITUTE dropped back then raced towards the rear, went around the turn in
the two path and was no factor. ZEEBEAR broke very awkwardly then bumped lightly with a foe, was off slow and spotted the front a few lengths, went three
wide for most of the turn, shifted four then five wide late on that bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. D'ONT LOSE CRUZ made light
contact with a rival at the start, raced just off the pace, came up empty on the turn and retreated then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.
