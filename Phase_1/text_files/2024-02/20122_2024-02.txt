Footnotes
FIRST HILL saved ground to turn, angled sharply causing trouble through the stretch, kept on and prevailed. PHAT CHANCE FANCY speed between
horses to the turn dug in gamely but nailed on the wire. ROCKABILLIE unhurried to the turn, rallied on in the stretch steady late gain. R QUEEN CANDY
pulled along inside to turn, troubled trip from that point. MIDNIGHT GRIND chased pace to turn, dueled into stretch, weakened late going. LONG BLACK
VEIL never threatened throughout. KAYA'S HALO three path run to the turn, checked hard mid stretch, lost chance. MISS SOVELIA slow into stride from
the gate, never menaced throughout. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE RUNNING OF FIRST HILL ENTERING THE STRETCH, ALSO
THERE WAS A RIDERS OBJECTION AGAINST PHAT CHANCE FANCY IN THE STRETCH RUN BY THE RIDER OF R QUEEN CANDY, AFTER
REVIEW BY THE STEWARDS FIRST HILL WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH FOR THE INFRACTION, ALSO THE OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED.

evenly with no late kick when needed in the stretch. OONDIRI awkward start, rushed to press early, cleared to far turn gave in. EVOCATION in tight
troubled into first turn, leveled off with no late kick. PASSING BAYOU dueled, chased pace to far turn with a steady fade back. FLOWERY PATH bottled up
between horses into far turn, gave way readily.
