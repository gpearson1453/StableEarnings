Footnotes
RUNANDSCORE raced in close pursuit of the pacesetter, took over on the final turn then edged away while kept to his task. DREAMWITHINADREAM
settled close up outside then continued willingly to gain the place. DUDLEY DICKERSON dropped back outside early, angled in on the final turn, altered
course in the lane and finished well. RAMBLININMYSHOES hustled to the front inside to the far turn and weakened. AMANI'S TIGER raced off the leaders
three wide and lacked a rally. VIRAL VIDEO moved off the pace, drifted very wide on the final turn and was no factor. LUCKY DANCER broke in a complete
tangle then trailed throughout.

with FLASHING DIAMOND past the furlong marker and drew clear under urging. FLASHING DIAMOND stalked close up outside, bid four wide on the turn,
gained a short lead, then dueled outside of the winner in midstretch and was outfinished. CLASSY SADIE dueled three wide in a contested early pace,
dueled on the turn, steadied slightly at the top of the lane, then held third. BOCA ROYALTY trailed the field, advanced between rivals on the turn, moved up
four wide at the quarter pole, then gained mildly outside in the lane. STARSHIP BLANCA raced off the pace, moved up five wide on the turn and faded.
GIA'S FUEGO dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and faded in the stretch. PEARLBDANCING dueled between rivals and gave way on the turn.

TIZ RACE DAY led in the two path, repelled a challenge on the turn and pulled away under moderate pressure. MERRYCHILL lacked speed, advanced
inside, angled out late and was just up for the place. SUNNY SIDE UP broke slowest, quickly rushed up inside to contest the pace and finished willingly but
was nailed for the place. WHISKEYSTREETBLUES trailed far behind then offered some late energy while no factor. BREEZY DANCE stalked the
pacesetters three wide and began fading on the turn. LUCKY OPPORTUNITY bumped early, chased three wide and gave way. KATE'S LOVE moved close
up between rivals in the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
THIRSTY PAPPY stalked close up two wide, then pressed the pacesetter, took over entering the far turn, pulled away on his own, responded to some mild
urging in the stretch run and was in hand late. CENTURION was in tight and checked entering the first turn, then settled off the pace inside, advanced two
wide on the far turn and rallied outside in the stretch for second. BIG BEEMSTER was outrun early, advanced at the quarter pole and rallied mildly outside
in the lane. ACHILLES HEEL stalked outside rivals, chased on the far turn and weakened in the stretch. KENNER set the pace on the inside, briefly dueled
with the winner, then chased and tired. HASTEN THENCE tracked on the inside, then two wide, chased on the far turn and faded. SAL N LOUIE raced off
the rail, off the pace, three wide on the far turn, chased and gave way.

TYCOON controlled the pace in hand, widened in the stretch and stayed safe driving. ARTISTIC REASON moved close inside throughout and continued
gamely to the finish. MAKABIM advanced wide on the first turn, loomed a stretch threat but flattened out. MUCHO MACHO EDDIE prompted the pace,
chased between rivals on the final turn, gave way. STRUM AND PLUCK raced inside and lacked a rally. EXCURSION settled off the pace in the two path
and was never a factor. AMOUNT dropped far back racing wide and was always outrun. JUST NOD AND SMILE faded after half a mile and weakened
steadily. TEEWINOT PASS was unhurried wide early and trailed throughout.

NASTY HABIT pursued the loose pacesetter, finished determinedly and wore down that rival in the late stages. HUNDRED GRAND quickly sprinted away
with a burst of speed, widened on the turn continued well then weakened late. CASTLE ISLAND chased three wide, was put to urging on the turn then went
evenly late. RESPIRATOR dropped far behind outside then caught fading rivals. BURN THE EVIDENCE flashed speed in the opening quarter then faded
inside on the turn. SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE lagged far behind and was never in contention. GENERAL STRIKE chased inside and was always outrun.
MCCHAYNE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

OMERTA CODE was outrun early, began to move up on the far turn, angled out four wide entering the stretch, closed steadily outside in the final furlong
and got up in the final strides for the win. WILKINSON WARRIOR vied two wide for the lead, dueled on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run,
continued willingly to the finish and was nailed at the wire. ALTA FOX stalked close up three wide, bid three wide entering the far turn, dueled past
midstretch, dug in and held for third. RUNNIN JOKE settled off the pace, chased three wide on the far turn and finished evenly. DREAM BIG DREAMS
hopped and was off slowly, raced off the pace, moved up near the inside, came three wide into the stretch and finished evenly. SMARTEN UP raced off the
rail, off the pace, went four wide on the far turn and failed to threaten. AFY KID stalked the leaders, chased four wide on the far turn and tired. DISTURBED
vied inside for the lead, then chased and gave way. W. P. CADET raced off the pace inside and did not factor.
