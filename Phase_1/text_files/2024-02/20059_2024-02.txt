Footnotes
IZZY'S BABY BOY unhurried in the beginning, moved up around the second turn, took the lead, drove clear down the lane and won under steady urging.
GOLDEN QUALITY raced near the middle of the field, moved up, between rivals around the final turn, made a wide bid and closed well. INDIMAAJ
unhurried in the early part, had an outside trip, made a bid, but lacked a late kick. RUNTODAY went to the front, drove clear and weakened. MUFFIN NUTS
raced evenly near the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no factor. MR. FOUR SEVENS raced evenly near the back, came around the final turn
on the outside and was never a threat. EXTIRPATOR raced within striking distance, made a bid and faded. AMERICAN SMOOTH void of early speed,
came around the second turn on the outside and was never close. UNCLE BRAD always raced near the back and showed little. MR. WIMBLEDON BAY
pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun.

forth a game effort. DRAG MALIBU raced evenly near the back, made a wide gain, but was no real factor. THA ILLEST DEAL dueled on the front end,

ROYAL DE BE raced within striking distance, came around the final turn on the outside, drove clear down the lane and finished well. MY UNCLE BILLY
lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a late bid and finished willingly. WILD FIST broke out, racing in the back, had an outside
trip, made a late gain, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. PRIX DE WEST challenged for the early lead, drove clear down the backside
and tired down the home stretch. FLYING IN HOT raced in the middle of the field, put forth an even effort, lacked a bid and was vanned off. TAPIT TWICE
void of early speed and showed little. ALPHIN dueled on the front end in the beginning, saved ground and dropped back.

LACIE BE GOOD stalked the leaders in the early going, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane with NOMADIC PRIDE and
proved the best. NOMADIC PRIDE vied for the early lead, drove clear, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others.
MY FRIEND AMY lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. DASHYNS DREAM pressed the early pace and weakened.
ANOTHER HOT MESS raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. ALLIACEOUS raced within striking distance, saved ground and lacked a rally.
ZING always raced near the back, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
SHE'S TAKIN OVER unhurried in the beginning, moved up between rivals around the second turn, drove clear down the stretch and won under steady
urging. ARMS APRIORITY pressed the pace, drove clear, saved ground, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. CAJUN TWO STEP
lacked early speed, entered the home stretch wide, made a bid, proved no match for the top two, but got up for third. A P HUMOR raced in the middle of the
field, saved ground around the second turn, made a mild bid and hung. BLESS D'SOUTH lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. KATIE'S
C hopped at the start, racing in the back and passed tired ones late. OUR AMEN raced near the middle of the field and faded. COME WHAT MAE raced
within striking distance and made a steady retreat. SADIE'S RANSOM sprinted to the front, drove clear and dropped back.
