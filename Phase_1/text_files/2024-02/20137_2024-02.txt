Footnotes
SUPERNAL tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the drive and was
roused into the stretch, was full of run at the furlong grounds, took command into the final sixteenth and edged away in the late stages for a solid debut win.
MISCHIEF'S KING prominent away from the start, pressed the decent early pace three deep into the turn, kept close attendance while three wide at the
quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into the drive, re-rallied at mid-stretch and vied for the lead nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the
winner in deep stretch and held well for the place. GALLOPING MAJOR showed good early speed, set a pressured pace into the turn, shook free into the
stretch, came under pressure at the furlong marker, was outfinished in the late stages and held safely for show honors. TIGERSUN unhurried away from the
start, raced outside of rivals into the turn and came four wide to the quarter marker, swung to five path into the stretch and was gaining in the final sixteenth.
A WALK ON THE MOON tracked the decent early pace from the second flight, maintained a two wide path to the quarter marker and did not offer a
response in the stretch. SEEKET SAUCE prominent away from the start, pressed the decent early pace from between runners, disputed the pace two wide
and between rivals approaching the quarter pole, battled to mid-stretch, lost position past the furlong marker and gave way.

Footnotes
INFINITE LOVE settled off of the early pace while not far back, raced two to three wide into the backstretch run, improved position at the half-mile marker
and was well placed into the far turn, ran in pursuit while saving ground approaching the quarter marker, tipped two wide for the drive, responded to firm
urging and challenged AFTER MY OWN HEART at mid-stretch, battled with that stubborn rival into the final sixteenth, took command in deep stretch and
held in a drive to prevail. AFTER MY OWN HEART showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, drew to a clear advantage along
the first turn then rated nicely while carving moderate fractions to the half-mile pole, kicked clear approaching the quarter marker, came under pressure into
the stretch, met the bid of INFINITE LOVE into the final sixteenth, was bested in deep stretch and held safely in the end for place honors. VIOLET
THUNDER was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the moderate early pace and kept close attendance to AFTER MY OWN HEART through the
backstretch run, lost ground to that rival along the second turn and re-rallied four wide into the stretch, could not match strides with the top two in the final
sixteenth and was well clear in the end for third. SILVER FLIRT allowed to settle while never far back, raced outside of runners along the first turn and came
four wide into the backstretch run, improved position at the half-mile marker and saved ground into the far turn, shifted three wide into upper stretch and
could not muster a response in the final furlong. LITTLE MISCHIEVOUS broke inwards at the start and was off a bit slowly, settled along the inside into the
first turn, lost position at the half-mile marker, could not keep pace along the second turn and came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
PETER FLIES broke sharply and sped to the front with TIGER ATTACK taking up the chase in close order, left that foe behind after passing the three
furlong marker, opened up in the stretch and cruised to an easy win. MR. FIGHTER was outrun early while racing three to four wide, stayed wide through
the turn while making some forward progress, came five wide into the stretch and closed best to get the second spot. HOT JOURNEY was content to track
the leading pair through the early going then was put into a drive from the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the stretch and lugged in for most of the
stretch run and was passed for second. MY BUCKET LIST broke awkwardly to the outside at the start and took up, trailed the field down the backstretch
then ran into traffic near the half, steadied slightly then and had to take up sharply approaching the three-furlong pole, swung six wide into the stretch and
ran on to pass a couple in the late stages. CARDINAL TRICK broke well and tracked a couple of lengths behind the early pace just behind HOT JOURNEY,
had to be ridden to keep up with the pace through the turn, got a reminder turning into the stretch but flattened out and finished evenly. TIGER ATTACK was
fractious and broke through the gate before the start, was reloaded without incident then at the start broke alertly rushed up to press PETER FILES for the
lead, began to weaken passing the three furlong pole and hand nothing left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
TOPPER'S CHIEFTESS was crowded by a neighboring rival and broke a step slowly, was unhurried in the early stages and maintained an outside path into
the turn, split rivals at the three-furlong pole and chased two wide to the quarter marker, angled four wide for the drive and rallied nearing the furlong
grounds, closed determinedly heading to the sixteenth-marker, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. GUIDE MY STEPS
broke out a step at the start, rated off of the decent early pace and tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile pole, saved ground into the turn,
angled three wide midway through the bend and improved position at the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch, battled for the lead and took a narrow
advantage at mid-stretch, held a narrow advantage while on the left lead approaching the sixteenth-marker, was outfinished by the oncoming winner in deep
stretch and held safely in the end for second. TAMARANDO COAST bobbled away from the start and was off a step slowly, recovered to be forwardly
placed in the early running, tracked three wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, swung five wide into the stretch and ran in pursuit to the
furlong pole, needed more into the final sixteenth but offered a mild late rally and was up in the final strides to secure show honors. NICE ENCOUNTER
broke sharply away from the start, showed good early speed and assumed command, set a decent pace into the turn, slowed the pace along the bend and
led to the quarter pole, met the bid of GUIDE MY STEPS into upper stretch and battled with that rival approaching the furlong marker, continued to battle
into the final sixteenth, faded in deep stretch and was outfinished for third in the final strides. SMILINGATTHEMOON rushed away from the start, raced
close up to the decent early pace and stalked the pacesetter two wide at the quarter marker, lost position into the stretch and did not offer a late rally.
BREVILLE was a bit keen in the early going while forwardly placed, came under a hold heading into the turn and ran in pursuit three wide to the quarter
marker, maintained that three wide path into the stretch, finished evenly and did not threaten in the late stages. APRICOT BRANDY was crowded a bit by a
neighboring rival away from the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages and saved ground into the turn, was outrun into the
stretch and did not factor.

Footnotes
REGAL PATRIOT showed good early speed while in hand and assumed command away from the start, set a fast pace while pressured into the turn, shook
free along the bend and carved out fast fractions heading to the quarter pole, drew off into the stretch and was kept to task at the furlong marker, was hand
urged into the final sixteenth and was geared down in deep stretch to prevail as much the best. TOWN PERFORMER prominent away from the start, took
back and tracked the fast early pace approaching the half-mile marker, was guided to the outside heading into the turn and chased three wide along the
bend, got caught a bit in tight at the quarter marker and swung four wide for the drive, ran in pursuit into the stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the
final sixteenth and outfinished LOOKIN TO EXCEL to secure place honors. LOOKIN TO EXCEL rated off of the fast and contentious early pace and tracked
from the second flight to begin, gained ground three wide along the turn and stalked the fast pace to the quarter pole, chased REGAL PATRIOT into the
stretch and was outkicked at the furlong grounds, could not muster a response into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest
for third. RUNNING ON FIRE bobbled leaving the start, was off a bit slowly and was allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground into the turn and
chased the fast pace to the quarter pole, offered a mild late rally in the stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. GOLDENSUNRISE hustled away
from the start, went up and pressed REGAL PATRIOT through solid fractions heading into the turn, kept attendance to the quick pace while two wide at the
quarter marker, lost position into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. CUT ACROSS SHORTY allowed to settle in the early stages, chased two wide
along the turn and did not factor in the stretch.

was well placed into the second turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, angled three wide into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, loomed
at mid-stretch and battled STAR RACER into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and lasted in the final strides for a determined win. STAR
RACER showed good speed away from the start and assumed command of the early running, dictated terms while setting a decent pace to the half-mile
pole, showed the way while off of the rail into the second turn and held foes at bay into upper stretch, met the bid of LAMMAS at mid-stretch and battled that
rival into the final sixteenth, was gamely bested in deep stretch and held safely in the end for place honors. I'MGONNABESOMEBODY prominent away
from the start, settled off of the early pace and maintained a three wide path along the first turn, was content to track the decent pace to the half-mile
marker, roused three wide into the second turn and gained ground at the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive and continued his run at the furlong
marker, was gaining into the final sixteenth and held well for third at the finish. FREEPORT JOE unhurried away from the start, brushed with PASSARANDO
entering the first turn and floated out that rival at the seven-furlong marker, maintained a three wide path into the backstretch run and was content to track
the decent pace approaching the half-mile pole, raced two wide and between rivals into the far turn and came in tight at the quarter marker, tipped three
wide for the stretch drive and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the finish. PASSARANDO
allowed to settle away from the start, brushed with FREEPORT JOE entering the first turn then was floated four wide by that rival at the seven-furlong
marker, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and was content to track the decent pace to the half-mile pole, was guided two to three wide
along the far turn and trailed into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and found his best stride late. AMERICAN FARMER allowed to settle
in the early going, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run, improved position into the far turn, mounted an inside rally into the stretch, could not
sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. SIR GREYSON showed good speed away from the start, ceded the early lead to STAR RACER
and stalked that rival through decent fractions into the backstretch run, stalked the pace to the half-mile marker then pressed STAR RACER while two to
three wide approaching the quarter pole, lost position into upper stretch, could not keep pace into the final furlong and was not persevered with into the final

turn, came into the stretch five wide, produced a strong rally under steady handling, checked slightly in deep stretch when ROSE OF MOONCOIN drifted
into her path but was along in time. ALONG CAME JOANN broke alertly but was outrun from the start, lagged well behind the field through the early going
then launched a sustained bid from the three furlong marker, swung five or six wide into the stretch, was gaining despite have trouble changing leads, got
straight in deep stretch and was up for second. ROSE OF MOONCOIN tracked in mid-pack through the early going then made a nice three wide mid-race
move on the turn to get into contention, had the rider drop the crop just past the quarter pole, finished well under strong handling despite wandering through
the stretch but came up short. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT broke sharply and went to the front without being asked, was joined by ANDRAMADA before a
furlong was run and dueled with that one and LILLY'S JOURNEY early, then backed off, moved off the rail, became boxed turning into the stretch then
found a hole up the rail, went to re-engage for the stretch run but could not summon another gear when needed. SPARKLE SWEETLY was a little slow into
stride but responded when prompted and made gradual forward progress towards the leaders down the backstretch, had to check near the three-eighths
pole but re-rallied, finished with a good run down the stretch, was gaining but ran out of time. LILLY'S JOURNEY broke well and joined the early pace battle
three wide, then was alone in front when ANDRAMADA suddenly dropped back, took a tenuous lead into the stretch trying to fend off a host of challengers,
gave way in the final furlong and was overtaken by most of the field in the late stages. ANDRAMADA broke well and vied with RIDIN'THESTORMOUT for
the early lead, then joined by LILLY'S JOURNEY near the half mile marker, dueled into the turn, then began to struggle to keep up passing the three furlong
pole, dropped back into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.
