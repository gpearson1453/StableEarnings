Footnotes
HALEY'S HAPPY GIRL stalked the pace in the two path, angled four wide to split rivals near the quarter pole, steadily gained while being floated out
through the stretch and was up in the final strides. REASSESS dueled in the three path, put away the pace rival in upper stretch, drifted out under
left-handed urging and gave way grudgingly. VAYESTA settled off the pace in the three path, angled five wide in upper stretch, had aim on the top two but
tended to try to get in and lacked the needed rally. MY SWEETHEART DANI broke toward the rear of the field, advanced four wide under a full drive nearing
the turn, made progress around the bend but faded in the lane. GLITTER BOMB dueled in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. KAP
HOORN chased the pace three wide and faltered in the stretch.

TRUMPETS set the pace in the two path, was cued while tipping inside turning into the lane, and kicked away under a drive. RETAIL THERAPY stalked in
the two path, was coaxed along from the rail around the turn, and ran on from the two path down the stretch for place. SAVE US MELANIA rated in the four
path, was cued midway around the turn, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. BIG DREAMER tracked in the four path,
floated out to the six path under a drive turning into the stretch, but was one paced. GHOZ ON chased in the three path but made no impact. SUGAR N
SPICE prompted the pace in the three path but weakened on her left lead from the four path down the lane. PURE MAGIC GIRL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHLOE'S TOY stalked in the three path, was cued midway around the turn, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and drew past an inner foe
around the sixteenth. PRINCESS BLAKELY set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, tipped out to the three path at the top of the lane,
and ran on but was caught around the sixteenth to place. ONE OF ONE bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path, swung out
to the seven path turning into the stretch, attempted to savage an inner foe in upper stretch, but was corrected, and kept on for show. BON DIA had a slow
start, laid wellback along the inside, and made no impact. MOTOWN MIKA bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked inside, floated out to the six path in
upper stretch, but evened out. TALKING WONDERS trailed in the three path early and never threatened. SPLURGE chased in the four path but never
menaced.

the place late without threatening the winner. THELASTBULLETSMINE stalked the winner two and three wide, had aim through the lane, could not gain on
the winner and was outfinished for the place late. DONTMESSWITHTESS saved ground off the pace, steadied while a bit rank around the first turn,
continued to save ground around the far turn, tipped three wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. STRAND OF GOLD failed to menace while racing two
and three wide. JUDGE JUDITH went evenly while racing two and three wide. CARDIO PRINCESS (JPN) raced off the pace three wide, advanced four
wide around the far turn and flattened out in the lane. AMUNET played no factor while racing two and three wide. YOOOU KNOW hopped at the start, raced
