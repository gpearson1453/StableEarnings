Footnotes
POP CHART raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path,
began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the wire to get up for the win late. SAILING AWAY raced in the three path around the first turn, dueled
on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and continued to battle gamely to the finish and narrowly missing. LUPITA saved
ground early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the rail around the second turn and gave way in the final furlong. GETAWAY
DAY raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the second turn from the two path and was
outkicked in the lane. WILD RULER hopped up leaving the gate, raced in the four path around the first bend, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside
for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the four path and was empty in the stretch. INZAWAY saved ground around the first turn,
trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was never a factor.

COOL PAPA G led the way on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and held clear to the finish. KEEN HEIR stalked the
leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground late. RIVERSIDE raced off the pace
up the backstretch, swung out to the six path coming around the turn, began a bid at the quarter pole and gained ground late. J C'S A LEGEND was
reluctant to load, delaying the start by several minutes, broke well and raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the
bend in the five path and improved position in the lane. PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and
passed tiring horses in the stretch. FLEET OF FLAGS bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader on the inside through the opening
stages, saved ground around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. COLOR ME LEGENDARY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early,
navigated the bend from the five path and faded in the lane. COASTAL FOG tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn
in the three path and faded from there.

Footnotes
COME CORRECT trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground on the
rail late to pull clear. MARY WALKER chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the lane.
JUSTIN'S LADY dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the bend in the three path and chased on to the wire. SHOUT IT
OUT raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and improved position from
there. KEBA LUCKY DAY stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and weakened in the lane.
LOVEABOVEANDBEYOND raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane while never truly
threatening. SLICE OF PIE dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch.
PALACE STAR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and was outkicked in the lane. BORN
TO REIGN raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the four path and was empty from there.
