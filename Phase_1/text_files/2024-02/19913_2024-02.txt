Footnotes
LATIGO ELLIS dueled outside a foe racing wide, drifted a bit leaving the turn, took charge in upper stretch, powered away under moderate urging while
much the best. TAZ MARKING was urged along chasing three wide into the turn, floated six deep out of that bend, was no match for the winner but kept on
to get the place. RAPPING RUMOR broke just a half-step slowly, was outpaced early racing outside at the rear five wide into the turn, floated nine deep
turning for home, ran on. HELLO WALTZ chased from outside mid-pack, moved out from four to seven wide turning into upper stretch, ran on evenly. AL
GRANO D ORO dueled inside a foe, floated out several paths leaving the turn, gave way in the stretch. BAM AGAIN dropped back inside heading into the
turn, moved out for the stretch run, was never near enough to threaten. MORE MONEY failed to menace racing mostly three to four deep. MISTER WU
switched out off the rail early, was not a factor.

Footnotes
STOREY'S FURY brushed lightly with a foe at the start, moved to the lead after the opening furlong inside a rival under mild encouragement, set the pace,
came out a bit turning for home, drew clear. SMILING RULER was reluctant to load, chased from between runners two to three wide on the turn moving out
a bit late on that bend, kept on in the stretch to get up and the nod for place. IFFY ASSET CLASS got away well and had the lead for the opening furlong
but was soon overtaken, chased from outside, weakened in the stretch. GEEBEESBIGBOY broke a bit awkwardly, chased moving up outside rivals in the
second flight, caught about four to five wide on the turn, floated out seven wide into upper stretch, evened out thereafter. ANGELA'S ANGEL raced toward
the rear off the inside, swung six wide into the stretch, showed mild willingness late. BAJA BOOGIE chased from inside the second flight on or just off the
rail, tired. HAPPY SLAPPER soon dropped back to last, failed to rally, tired.

Footnotes
LET THERE BE PEACE bumped a rival at the start, was well placed just off the leaders stalking in hand, willingly advanced heading into the turn, took the
lead at the five-sixteenths but was then challenged by an outside foe, put to urging by the quarter pole, dueled into upper stretch, dug in to edge clear and
held sway despite drifting out a bit late. IM STILL THIRSTY exchanged a light brush at the start, was guided out late up the backstretch then rapidly
advanced outside foes four to five wide on the turn, bid coming to the quarter pole, floated eight deep into upper stretch dueling outside the eventual winner,
was turned back by that one but second best. SENSE OF URGENCY was coaxed from the start, soon made the lead to set the pace up the backstretch in
the two path, was increasingly pressured into the turn, overtaken late on that bend, had no extra. AQUIMINE was reserved at the back, tipped out five wide
past the quarter pole, ran on to improve. MICKEYS GOLD exchanged minor contact at the start, was caught outside foes off the pace three to four wide
through the turn, shifted in a bit, lacked the needed late kick. M G M'S LUCKY was bumped at the start but up close early pursuing the pace three wide into
the turn, soon dropped back and faded. ABETEMARCO swung seven wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. SHAME ON ROOSTER chased briefly
from inside, tired. PER ECM2024-60 FROM HIWU, LET THERE BE PEACE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HOT CHARLIE bumped the outer foe at the start, quickly made the lead, set a pressured pace from off the rail, edged away into upper stretch, was
challenged by an inside foe in mid-stretch, turned back that one and held off a late resurgence from the outside rival. WHERES BRAYDEN was bumped at
the start, advanced two to three wide on the turn, altered in past the quarter pole, bid inside the eventual winner in upper stretch drawing even, dueled
briefly, was turned back and held off. STYLE BENDER pressed the eventual winner three to four wide early on the turn, drifted six wide leaving that bend
while losing ground, came again late but was not enough. CERVEZA was off the pace mid-pack outside about four to five wide drifting seven to eight deep
for the drive, was no match for the top trio but bested the rest. STORMIN FAST was near the inside mostly two wide and not a threat. HOLD ME ONLY
chased from inside, steadied at the seven-sixteenths in tight quarters, swung seven wide for the stretch run and had no late bid. RIGHT ON TIME failed to
threaten racing just off the inside.

PLEASE THE COURT settled at the rear, engaged in a long drive being encouraged along just past the three-eighths, advanced outside foes four to six
wide through the turn into upper stretch, struck the lead by the eighth pole and drew clear under urging. MAGIC MOSCO had the early lead then pressed
just off and outside the new leader heading to the turn, moved out from three to five wide coming out of that bend, was no match for the winner but second
best. TRUST MANDO prompted the pace from inside but off the fence taking the lead just outside the half, was hounded into upper stretch drifting out a bit,
overtaken outside the eighth pole and faded. OPEN ROAD chased from inside, failed to rally running on evenly. CAIRO KING chased about three to four
wide, asked by the five-sixteenths, failed to rally.

MARQUIS LIGHTS stalked from outside, moved to a narrow lead four wide about the three-eighths, dueled through the stretch, inched away late. MAMA
WAS A ROCKET moved forward inside to vie for the lead but just off the rail, drifted four wide into upper stretch, dueled, was outfinished but clearly second
best. CHARLIES HURRICANE settled off the leaders going between foes three to four wide on the turn, floated seven wide turning for home, was no match
for the top pair but best of the rest. MOONLIGHT WARRIOR saved ground inside on or just off the rail, ran on evenly and made no bid. QUITE LOVELY
was prominent early two to three wide, dropped back on the turn, was not persevered with late, walked off. TIZ A JOURNEY veered out at the start, chased
from outside, raced mostly four to six wide, was eased in the stretch and vanned off.

MUSICS MY VICE settled off the pace, shifted seven wide coming to the quarter pole beginning to advance, struck the lead outside the sixteenth pole and
drew clear. DEACON BEACON stalked, advance steadily five to six wide taking the lead outside the three-sixteenths, was overtaken inside the final eighth
and just saved the place. SHAME ON SAM was unhurried, swung ten wide, kicked on belatedly finishing strongly to just miss second. I AM THE JUAN
attended the pace about five wide, had no late bid. FLAG THE FOOTNOTE chased in behind up close, steadied in tight quarters nearing the three-eighths,
continued close up in behind three to four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. WHY FOR was prominent early, pressed from inside on or just off the rail, tired.
MIST N SEVEN pursued from inside and failed to menace. CASH CRUZER got away well, soon led, set the pace about three wide, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
WAY RITE raced in behind up close to the leaders about three to four deep into the turn, shifted six wide late on that bend, took aim and struck the lead in
mid-stretch, cleared and held sway. GONNABEE settled off the pace, fanned seven wide leaving the turn, kept on in the stretch but was second best. SHE
HIT A HOMER was keen to go on with it rapidly advancing up the backstretch under a hold, made the lead about three to four wide leaving the backstretch,
vied through the turn, was outkicked. FOR FUN stalked from outside making a bid four to five wide at the three-eighths taking a narrow lead, kept on late,
missed show. BODIE'SLITTLEGIRL settled at the rear, moved three to four wide on the turn passing foes. WILLSHERWONTSHE settled well back of the
pace, angled nine wide and passed tired rivals. I WIN LIKA GIRL vied inside on or just off the rail, came up empty. ROBTHEQUEEN was urged at the break,
vied two to three wide, tired, was not persevered with late and walked off.

Footnotes
RUNNING FOR GRACE settled off the leaders near the inside, sought room maneuvering out and in coming past the quarter pole, came out again in upper
stretch, bid between rivals late to prevail. FIRST TIME PLAYER steadied just after the break as rivals came out, settled at the rear, advanced outside five
wide on the turn moving out eight deep turning into upper stretch, bid late but was outfinished. SUERTUDA stalked the leaders advancing to within striking
distance four to five wide on the turn and asked for more by the quarter pole, floated out a bit turning for home, kept on solidly to bid inside foes late but was
outfinished. ISLA JANE was relatively close early, allowed to settle and dropped back, angled nine wide at the top of the stretch, kept on evenly to improve.
HAUTE LADY set the pace racing off the rail, was clear of foes turning into upper stretch, faltered late. EMMYS SILVER advanced near the rail turning for
home, was in a bit tight in upper stretch and evened out late. SPICEY SECRET bumped with a foe at the start, shifted in early racing near but off the rail into
the turn, angled out at the top of the stretch, passed tired foes. MAUI SUNRISE bumped with a rival at the start, moved forward to press then prompt the
issue up the backstretch, put to urging by the five-sixteenths, drifted about a bit at the top of the stretch and faded. SPARKLE IN THE SKY chased from
inside, dropped back and tired.
