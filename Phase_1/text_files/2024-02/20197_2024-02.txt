Footnotes
ISAYSO went clear in the opening furlong to set an open pace in the three path going into the turn, was cued passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path
at the top of the lane, and dug in to hold off an outer pair. SMART JENNY trailed along the inside early, was coaxed in the two path midway around the turn,
swung from the six path into the stretch, tipped one more path outward passing the eighth pole, and rallied to be up for place. TRAVEL HAPPY prompted
the early pace in the three path, was ridden into the turn, floated out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. SPIRIT OF VICTORY
stalked in the three path, was coaxed in the two path passing the quarter, but flattened in the three path down the lane. INABLINK chased in the four path
before merging to the rail going into the turn, but weakened from the four path in the stretch. GHOZ ON rated in the five path but never threatened.

Footnotes
TRUCKER was bumped at the start, pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under a drive. CANAVERO
set the pace along the rail, was collared near the five-sixteenths pole, could not keep pace with the winner but held well clear of the rest. GUAIO chased the
pace two wide, lacked a rally and bested the rest. CLOAK AND DAGGER steadied leaving the chute, raced four wide and never threatened. CURLINS
CRUZIN was bumped at the start, raced four wide and faltered in the lane. WHITBY broke inwardly, checked off heels soon after, lost contact with the field
around the turn, was pulled up in upper stretch and walked off.

EMARAATY (GB) tracked in the three path, was cued passing the quarter, swung from the five path into the stretch, hung on his left lead, but stayed on to
inch past an inner rival in the closing stages. SOGNO DI CAMPIONE (CHI) showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the three path down the
backside, waited confidently in the two path rounding the far turn, was roused from the three path into the stretch, dug in into the final furlong, but was edged
out late by an outer foe to place. STREET READY rated in the two path, was coaxed early around the far turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the
lane, and kept on for show. KLUGMAN stalked inside but weakened in the stretch. LUCKY CURLIN laid in range in the four path but backed up around the
far turn.

Footnotes
MAD MADAME MIM (IRE) settled off the pace while racing in the two path around the first turn, circled five wide around the far turn, seized command in
upper stretch and drew clear in the final furlong. NIGHTSABER (GB) raced off the pace four wide, advanced four wide between foes around the far turn,
briefly led turning for home, was no match for the winner but dug in to hold the place. PIMENOVA raced off the pace three and four wide, rallied outside and
just missed second. GRANDMA'S PUDDING tracked the pace three wide and was outkicked in the stretch. SWEET SENSATION failed to menace while
racing two and three wide. BULLET VALENTINA played no factor while racing three and four wide. R AWESOME SAUCE prompted the pace two wide, took
the lead near near the five-sixteenths pole but tired in the lane. ANONYMOUS SOURCE raced up close two wide, steadied late on the first turn, remained in
range two wide around the far turn and lacked a closing bid. CRASH THE CREASE saved ground in range, steadied late on the first turn, continued to
chase inside around the far turn and had little left for the drive. GRATIA was outrun inside. CAPTURE THIS set the pace along the rail and faltered nearing
the five-sixteenths marker.

Footnotes
SANPIRODU rated inside, had to wait along the rail rounding the far turn, was coaxed while angling out to the six path turning into the lane, and rallied past
an inner pair late. THE HONEYMAN laid up close in the three path, bid two wide around the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for
place. ICE THE KICKER set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside passing the three-eighths, tipped out to the three path at the top of the
stretch, and kept on, but drifted out slightly in the final sixteenth and was caught by an outer pair late to show. DESIGNATED HITTER tracked in the three
path, was cued in the four path passing the three-eighths, fanned out to the eight path at the top of the lane, but made no impact. NOBLE WAVE stalked in
the two path but faded on his left lead in the stretch. PAPA DO PAPA DO chased in the four path, ranged up to bid three wide midway around the far turn,
floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and weakened. PIRATE RADIO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KING CAB set the pace in the three path, floated out to the four path turning into the lane, was roused while lugging in on his left lead passing the eighth
pole, and dug in to hold off an outer foe. NICHIREN tracked in the two path, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, tipped inwards while running
on, but just missed getting up to settle with place. FAMOUS GENT trailed in the two path, was driven along the rail around the turn, and kept on for show.
TREASURE KING chased in the three path but did not threaten.

Footnotes
THEMANUPFRONT set a clear pace just off the rail and held firm under a drive. COINVEST saved ground in range, tipped two wide in upper stretch and
was gaining late. OSCARWORTHY prompted the winner two wide, was under a drive around the turn, lacked the needed stretch kick but lasted for the
show. HANGIN IN THERE broke awkwardly, was strung out five wide around the first turn, chased three wide around the far turn and was one-paced
through the lane. ASSERTOR raced off the pace two and three wide, shied out under left-handed urging in midstretch and had a mild rally when kept to
hand urging in the final furlong. AGAPEE MOU raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and was no threat. BIVOL lagged inside early,
went four wide around the far turn and was never involved. LIVE HIGH LIVE LOW steadied at the start, was caught four wide between foes around the first
turn, saved some ground around the far turn and had no response. PUCKSTER was outrun inside.

Footnotes
CAJUN BROTHER set the pace inside, was roused passing the quarter, and drifted outward through the stretch while drawing clear. CELESTIAL GLAZE
brushed with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, was cued midway around the turn, and ran on from the four path in the stretch for
place. PAY ZONE laid up close in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the seven path at the top
of the lane, and evened out for show. REAL TALK tracked in the two path, was ridden into the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the stretch, but
flattened. FLOAT ON rated in the two path but made no impact. MAGICAL WARRIOR brushed with an inner foe at the start, chased in the three path but
weakened from the six path down the lane.
