Footnotes
I KNOW MAP was well rated early on the inside, made a four wide move on the turn, then continued that move off the turn to go on even terms for
command by the furlong marker and then slowly edged clear to prove best, driving. NUEDORF set a pressured pace early three wide, then shook clear on
the turn and dropped to the two path, then was headed nearing the furlong marker, dug in gamely and fought on but was out-kicked by the winner.
HAMMER stalked the early pace three wide, then was between rivals leaving the turn, angled out leaving the furlong marker and ran on late to just miss the
place award. COOL IN BLUE was well placed along the rail, saved ground on the turn and remained on the inside through the lane to late and kept on but
needed more late. OUR ANDREW B was settled early, three wide on the turn and came four wide off the turn and had no rally. DEVINE FLAMEAWAY
pressed the pace from between rivals early and weakened. TAPORICAL trailed throughout while not being asked.

EMIRATES AFFAIR set the early pace while racing removed from the rail, then was challenged nearing the quarter pole, but turned back that bid and drew
out in the drive to prove much the best under a mild drive. ABIDALE was rated early, two wide on the far turn and rallied well for the place award while no
match for the winner. CARROLL GIRL stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to press the winner but failed to sustain that bid
and weakened, bested rest. ANNA ROCKS was reserved three to four wide and had no rally. REACHING STRIDE was off a step slow, reserved towards
the inside and had no rally.

SUPER DUPER FLY set the early pace three wide, then drew clear on the turn two wide, then widened the margin off the turn and then maintained a safe
margin to the wire to prove best under a drive. NO MORE DIAMONDS stalked the early pace four wide, three wide on the turn and ran on to the wire to be
clearly second best. MASKED HEROINE was rated two wide early, made a three wide bid on the far turn and came four wide off the turn but flattened out,
bested the rest. OUT OF AMMO was reserved early, made a four wide move by the quarter pole and came five wide off the turn but flattened out late. BALI
MOON stumbled at the start and trailed early, five wide by the quarter pole and came wide into the lane and had a belated rally for the minor rewards. LIL H
tracked the early pace on the inside and weakened. HIGHWAY QUEEN stalked the pace in between rivals early and weakened. MUGURUZA was settled
early on the inside and was not a threat. NADIABIZNIZ prompted the early pace two wide and stopped. AFTER THE RUNNING OF THIS RACE THE
STEWARDS DEEMED THE TRACK TOO BAD TO RACE ON AND THE REMAINING RACES WERE CANCELLED.
