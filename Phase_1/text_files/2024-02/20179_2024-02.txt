Footnotes
CHECKING BOXES took control at once, drew further clear on the turn then widened in the stretch while kept to a drive. MY BROTHER CHARLIE broke
slowest ducking in, advanced inside to gain the place. KICK STARTNESS raced in closest pursuit of the winner and tired in the final furlong. WRIGLEY
RESERVE was urged just off the pacesetter inside then was finished after half a mile. JAKNAVA chased wide throughout and lacked a rally. RORY'S
ORCHARD dropped back after the start and was always outrun. CARRY GRANT broke alertly then lacked speed and was never a factor. STAR RULER
raced outside and weakened steadily.

Footnotes
NIEUWENDYK vied two wide for the lead, dueled with MCMAGIC into the far turn, put a head in front, edged away and then drew clear under urging.
MCMAGIC vied inside for the lead, dueled with the winner on the far turn, dug in gamely inside in the stretch run and held on well for the place spot.
DOUBLE O OTTO tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn, angled out at the top of the lane, rallied mildly and got third. BLUEY stalked two wide,
chased on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly and was outkicked. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT raced off the pace inside, chased inside on
the turn and closed belatedly on the rail. LAST DREAM broke a step slow, raced four wide early, settled two wide off the pace, chased on the far turn and
gained belatedly outside. BOINTHEBACK was outrun early and did not factor. MARVELOUSMOONDANCE raced off the pace, failed to respond and gave
way in the lane.

Footnotes
DECOUPAGE chased close up on the inside, chased on the turn, made a rail bid at the quarter pole, dueled with OLD HEAD, gained a short lead near the
sixteenth marker and drew clear, driving. OLD HEAD set the pace racing two wide, shook free, dueled into the stretch, dug in gamely outside of
DECOUPAGE and came up second best. LUNA T was outrun early, advanced on the turn, angled out entering the stretch and rallied mildly for third.
CAUSE I SAID tracked on the inside, saved ground on the turn, angled out at the top of the lane and gained mildly. FAIRY DREAMS chased between rivals,
continued between foes on the turn and weakened. PEACELOVENKARMA was off a bit slow, outrun early and passed tired rivals. BOCA ROYALTY raced
off the rail, off the pace, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. COLLIN'S GREY LADY chased five wide early, three wide on the turn and gave
way. LEAN ON E chased three wide, between rivals on the turn and gave way. BACK TO D' FUTURE chased four wide early, three wide on the turn and
gave way.

stretch, then weakened and saved the show spot. HIBACHI raced off the pace inside and closed belatedly for fourth. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE raced off the
pace inside, chased inside on the turn and lacked a rally. HANEY BOYS chased four wide, continued three or four wide on the turn and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
PEACH PERFECT advanced inside before the opening half, offered a strong bid on the turn then quickly drew off through the stretch. SUMMARY
JUDGMENT took over before the opening quarter, was collared nearing the stretch, tired but lasted for the place. SALAGADOOLA dropped far behind,
rallied inside with some late energy. MISS CHAMITA trailed far behind then finished well without menacing. LULI'S DANCER saved ground off the pace and
lacked a response. HIGHTIME VALENTINE broke alertly and led briefly then pursued the pacesetter and faltered. TOMARIE dropped far behind and was
never in contention. CONNELMAURA moved very wide into the stretch and gave way. FAST MULE settled behind quick early fractions then stopped
abruptly.
