start, pulled along to the turn, angled out into the stretch and closed the gap late. BOURBON HEIST raced along evenly from the half for the show spot.
STORM DADDY good position throughout with no response when needed. NIGHT TIME never factored throughout. CONDEMN caught in tight at the start
with a steady fade thereafter. SIR ALFRED JAMES inside run to duel for a half with nothing left and dropped back.

R QUEEN CANDY outside chase to the turn, confident handling to run on to clear at the wire. I WANT RUFFLES no speed early on, rallied along from the
turn for the place spot. VALERIE BLUE good position early, chased top two for show spot, best of rest. JUST LIKE YOU pinched back start, raced along
evenly in the stretch run. SUMMER ICE never threatened. INTERCEPTION broke well, backed up with no speed throughout, passed some tired ones late to
mildly improve in the stretch run. DON'T TOUCH speed to the front, hounded to the turn with nothing left stretch. MADAM LEOTA failed to menace
throughout. CHARCOR tried to keep up for a half with nothing left into the far turn. THE ENEMY OF FUN never menaced throughout. MARVELING always
back and never a factor.
