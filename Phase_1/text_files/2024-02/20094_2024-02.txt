FONTINA laid up close outside the leader in the four path, took command in the two path early into the turn, kicked away turning into the stretch, and was
kept to task to hold sway. SPREAD THE RISK tracked in the two path, was coaxed in the four path early into the turn, tipped out to the six path turning into
the stretch, and kept on for place. SPANISH GIRL chased in the five path, floated out to the nine path turning into the lane, and was up for show. GOOD
MAGIC WOMAN raced off the pace in the two path but made no impact along the inside in the stretch. CHURCH GIRL set the pace in the two path but
yielded rounding the turn. HOLY KINGDOM trailed throughout around the four path.

Footnotes
CLASSIC MO TOWN settled off the pace while racing three wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch, closed
outside and was up and clear late. ASK IN MY NAME saved ground in range, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, angled back to the rail in
upper stretch, bid inside of the leader nearing the eighth pole, dueled to deep stretch, won that duel but could not resist the winner late. VICTORS VALIANT
pressed the pace three wide, drew clear midway around the far turn, led to deep stretch and was outfinished. HIGH STAKES raced in range two wide early,
angled four wide leaving the first turn, chased four wide around the far turn and was one-paced through the lane. WIDERIGHT had early speed inside,
checked midway around the first turn, angled three wide soon after, stalked the pace three wide from there, continued on the left lead in the lane faded. THE
MAR saved ground and failed to menace. BOLD LOOKER was outrun inside. UNCAPTURED BOY set the pace two wide around the first turn and at the rail
around the far turn and faltered nearing the quarter pole. BALTIC MULE played no factor while racing three and four wide.

quartet in the final furlong. INSANITY IT SEEMS set the pace in the two path, was cued while tipping out to the three path turning into the stretch, kicked on
to hold the lead into the final furlong, but was caught late by an outer foe to place. BIRTHDAY MUNNINGS chased in the two path, was coaxed in the four
path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. MOTOWN PUNK tracked inside, was ridden in the three path around the turn, swung from the five path
into the stretch, but made no impact. CHEYENNE BRAVE prompted the early pace along the inside but faded in the stretch. VINICIO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
FLYING BLACK stalked the pace in the three path around the first turn and in the two path around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, moved to
the front near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. DON'T GET PICKLED settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the
far turn, took the lead near the quarter pole, led to the sixteenth pole and fought on outside of the winner late. CINDYLOUWHO saved ground in midpack,
angled out in upper stretch and was along for the show. KANTBACKOFF broke awkwardly, raced off the pace three wide around the first turn, saved ground
around the far turn and never threatened. WICKLOW GAL set the pace in the two path and gave way near the quarter pole. CINDY'S SONG tracked the
pace two wide, bid three wide between foes around the far turn but came up empty in the lane. MUSICAL ROMANCE (GB) saved ground off the pace, went
five wide around the far turn and made little impact. PASSIONFORTREASURE was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
DONEGAL FOREVER stalked three deep down the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, bid from the six path into the stretch, and inched
past an inner foe. BOURBON RESOLVE tracked outside of foes down the backstretch, was driven in the four path around the far turn, and ran on in the two
path down the lane for place. SARA'S SHAMAN showed the way in the two path turning into the backstretch, was cued midway around the far turn, angled
out to the five path turning into the lane, but was caught on both sides in the final sixteenth to show. GAME WARDEN rated, was driven in the three path
around the far turn, but flattened along the inside in the final furlong. KNOX got bumped by an outer foe at the start, raced well off the pace and made no
impact from the seven path in the stretch. SMILE MON prompted the pace outside the leader down the backstretch but faded along the inside in the stretch.
EMPIRESTRIKESFAST veered in and bumped an inner foe at the start, then raced wellback and never menaced.
