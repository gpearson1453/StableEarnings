Footnotes
SOFSTER bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the six path, was coaxed turning into the stretch, and rallied past an inner duo in the final furlong.
MY SARASOTA QUEEN set the pace in the two path, was ridden into the turn, dug in to repel an outer challenger going into the final furlong, but was
caught by another late charging outer foe in the final sixteenth to place. SHE CAN SCAT bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was
driven around the turn, and finished evenly down the lane to get up for show late. CAJUN ANTHEM prompted the pace in the four path, bid under coaxing
turning into the lane, but flattened in the final furlong. SAND WEDGE stalked in the three path, was cued into the turn, but faded in the stretch. JAZZIN laid
wellback along the inside but never threatened. IN AMERICAN raced off the pace from out in the seven path going into the turn and never menaced.

Footnotes
OSCAR'S WORLD raced in range two and three wide, took over in upper stretch and drew clear under left-handed urging. KICK A BUCK was shut off soon
after the start, saved ground off the pace around the first turn, advanced four and five around the far turn and rallied outside for the place. GALICIA'S
SPIRIT veered out at the start, raced three wide in midpack, angled four wide to bid near the quarter pole, lugged in through the lane and held third.
YANKEE DRUMMER stalked the early pace inside, bid two wide between foes rounding the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, was collared by
the winner in upper stretch, fought on inside to the sixteenth pole and as in a bit tight late. FLY ERIK FLY raced in range two wide and faded in the lane. AZ
U CHASE ME was bumped between foes at the start, raced far back two wide and passed tiring rivals. RAMESSES failed to menace while racing two wide.
HEAT LIGHTNING hit the starting gate and bumped foes at the start, moved two wide to the lead around the first turn, cleared and set the pace along the
rail from late on that bend and gave way nearing the quarter pole. GRAND MAXIME was bumped at the start and trailed throughout.

midway around the far turn, dug in from the three path into the stretch, exchanged bumps with an outer challenger in the final sixteenth, but held on.
NORTHSHORE DRIVE tracked in the four path, was coaxed along around the far turn, bid while tipping inwards going into the final furlong, exchanged

DESIGNATED HITTER tracked the pace three wide, took over near the five-sixteenths marker and drew off under a drive. MODERN LANE raced in range
three and four wide, could not match strides with the winner but ran on for the place. BUILDER JAK tracked the pace from the rail, was blocked in
midstretch, angled out near the sixteenth pole and rallied for the show. FEDERAL HIGHWAY pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes midway around
the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and weakened. SLEIPNIR set the pace along the rail, was collared near the sixteenth pole and faded
through the stretch. MACUTO saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn and never threatened. KUWAIT TOWERS raced five wide
around the first turn, checked late on the bend, got out and steadied along while rank down the backstretch, angled down to the two path early on the far
turn, settled down and finished with belated interest. CROSS EXAM was outrun inside. SOLAR FLASH hit the starting gate, raced three and four wide and
made little impact. TORREFACTOR played no factor while racing three wide. NO MATCH CHARLIE chased the pace three wide and retreated after six
furlongs.

Footnotes
SAND DANCER tracked in the four path, loomed approaching the quarter, swept to the lead while being roused from the five path into the stretch, and held
sway. GOOCH GO BRAGH stalked in the two path, but was stymied passing the quarter, angled out to the six path turning into the lane, and ran on for
place. INFAMOUS COVERT bobbled at the start, trailed from the three path into the backstretch, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the
lane, and kept on for show. GLIDING AFLEET laid off the pace along the inside down the backstretch, was coaxed along the rail around the far turn, and
finished evenly from the four path in the stretch. VELOCE bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, floated out to the seven path turning
into the lane, but made no impact. OFFICER COUNTRY bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid in range in the three path, headed the leader while under
a nudge early around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. RESTORED ORDER sprinted out of the gate to set an open pace just off the rail turning into the
backstretch, was coaxed into the far turn, but gaveway in upper stretch. BURNING MAN raced wellback in the two path and never menaced.

Footnotes
RAPTURE BAY stalked the pace from the rail, came through inside of the pacesetter to seize command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead.
THEMANUPFRONT set the pace in the two path, was collared by the winner near the sixteenth pole and held well to preserve the place. MYTHIC
PERFORMANCE raced in range two wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn, lacked the needed rally but kept on to gain the show late.
IZZY D'ORO pressed the pace three wide and was outfinished in the final furlong. PET MAT saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, tried to
split horses through a dubious hole in midstretch, checked hard when unable to get through and was not urged from there. CPTBOBSBTWENTYNINE hit
the starting gate but was still away in midpack, saved ground in range, went two wide between foes around the far turn, tried to split rivals in midstretch but
was sawed off between foes and not urged from there. HIGHLAND PEAK broke a bit awkwardly, checked while forced five wide into the first turn, raced
mostly four wide around that bend, angled into the two path for the far turn and lacked a rally. REGALITO was forced six wide entering the first turn, angled
down into the three path not long after but never reached contention. OMAHA EIGHT raced up close inside early, checked off heels nearing the first turn,
veered out soon after, raced wide from there and was through after a half. THE RIDER OF CPTBOBSTWENTYNINE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST MYTHIC
PERFORMANCE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT PET MAT WAS THE ACTUAL
CULPRIT AND DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM FIFTH TO SIXTH.

Footnotes
FORTUNA BELLE set the pace in the three path, merged into the two path early around the turn, was roused from the four path into the lane, inched clear
passing the eighth pole, and held sway. LOVIN MAKES CENTS turned her head as the gate opened, rated in the two path, waited in the three path around
the turn, was roused while floating out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. TREVESS stalked in the two path and kept on from the
three path down the lane for show. BIG BAND LUZZIANN prompted the pace in the four path, was coaxed from the five path turning into the stretch, but
flattened. HEIR TO THE ROAR slowly broke out at the start, trailed in the three path and made no impact from the six path in the stretch. LOVE PARADOX
raced up close between foes in the three path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
BEELINE set the pace along the rail, was headed near the five-sixteenths pole but spurted clear in the lane. MR SKYLIGHT pressed the pace two wide,
took a short lead near the five-sixteenths pole, could not match strides with the winner in upper stretch, drifted out through the lane and just lasted for the
place. IT'S MY LIFE broke slowly, made good progress inside down the backstretch, was up close inside around the turn, angled three wide near the
quarter pole, was floated out through the lane and just missed second. SECRET CRUSH raced off the pace two wide and passed tiring rivals in the lane.
PROPRIETARY TRADE raced in range three and four wide, lugged in in upper stretch and faded. HUNT BALL was bumped at the start, raced three wide
and never threatened. GREAT LILO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. AWESOME WIND played no factor while racing four wide.
TRUCKER broke slowly then checked off heels, made solid progress five wide around the turn but had little left for the drive. TOMMY TWO SOCKS hopped
as the start then was bumped, raced well back four wide and never reached contention. J J VALENTIN was outrun inside. NAVESINK PIRATE caught a flier
at the start but lacked speed and steadily retreated.

Footnotes
COPPOLA rated in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, rallied from the three path into the final furlong, and inched past an outer foe late.
PANTHER ISLAND tracked in the two path, swung out to the six path under a ride turning into the lane, ran on to lead while tipping in passing the eighth
pole, but was caught in the closing stages by an inner foe to place. EAMONN trailed in the three path turning into the stretch, angled out to the seven path
passing the eighth pole, and rallied for show. CAROTARI chased in the four path, was coaxed along while fanning out to the seven path turning into the
stretch, and finished evenly. HOPE IN HIM pressed in the three path, bid around the turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. THAT'S RIGHT was
sent from the gate to set the pace along the inside but yielded in the final furlong. HEAVEN STREET stalked inside but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
IN A JAM rated in the two path, was coaxed passing the quarter, angled out to the six path turning into the stretch, rallied outside of a trio into the final
furlong, and got up in the final strides. TRIKARI showed the way around the first turn but was overtaken by an outer foe turning down the backside, laid up
close along the inside, was roused to take command from the rail approaching the quarter, drifted out to the five path passing the eighth pole, and was
caught in the final strides by an outer foe. TIFAREEH broke out at the start, trailed in the two path, angled out to the eight path passing eighth pole, and
rallied for show. RUNNIN' ROCKET pulled while four wide around the first turn, stalked in the three path down the backstretch, swung from the five path into
the stretch, but was in tight while evening out late. GENERAL LEDGER tracked in the three path, was cued along the inside midway around the turn, but
was one paced. KING OF THE TRACK laid up close in the two path, but lost ground passing the half, and was no factor. TURN UP THE TREES had to
check between foes leaving the first turn, raced off the pace in the three path and did not threaten. BAYTOWN PARFAIT was rank in the five path around
the first turn and overtook an inner foe to set the pace in the two path down the backstretch, but yielded and had to check between foes turning into the
stretch.

MEDIA SENSATION stalked the pace three wide early, dueled two wide between foe around the far turn, took the lead near the eighth pole and dug in
gamely between foes. LITTLE STEVEN was bumped at the start, disputed the pace in the three path around both turns, fought on between rivals while
trying to get in through the lane and just missed. TIZ THE COAST was bumped at the start, steadied along three wide, angled five wide in upper stretch,
rallied and just missed second. HARI dueled inside throughout and was narrowly outfinished inside of foes. BREAK THE ICE saved ground off the pace,
advanced five wide around the far turn and had a mild stretch gain. NO REGARD was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground in range and lacked
a rally. TRUTH AND HONESTY was washy pre-race, raced up close five wide around the first turn, bid four wide around the far turn, turned for home on
even terms and weakened. CHACHARERO played no factor while racing four and five wide.
