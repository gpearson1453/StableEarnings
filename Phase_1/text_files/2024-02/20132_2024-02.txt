Footnotes
GOLDEN REIGN inside speed, dueled to the stretch, kicked on late to clear off under stout handling to the wire in a good effort. LONGSHADOW unhurried
to the turn, rallied, closed willingly to wire no match. PERUVIAN LUCKY between horses to the turn, rallied on in the stretch to improve. EL ROSILLO no
speed to the turn, rallied on in the stretch run to move up. HOLIDAY HOUSE inside run to the turn, bid stretch, turned back late going. FAST BOAT TO
SKYE tracking top pair to turn, bid into stretch, weakened late going. HARDY CHOICE raced along evenly to the stretch, faded back to wire. ENGLISH TIDE
quick from outside with a brief duel to turn, gave in readily. BLUE NORTHER never factored throughout. LEGAL ATTACK (GB) failed to menace throughout.
CATIPARI always back with response.
