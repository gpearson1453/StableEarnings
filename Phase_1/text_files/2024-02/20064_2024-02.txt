Footnotes
SQUARE SLICE saved ground around the turn under patient handling, eased out to the two path near the eighth pole, took command near the sixteenth
pole and held sway. WITHOUT PRETENCE , a forward factor along the inner rail on the turn, eased out to the three path entering the stretch and rallied.
STELLARS IN CHARGE broke alertly, sped to a clear, early lead, set the pace along the rail and weakened late. BUCKIN' DREAMER rushed up early,
chased the pace two wide around the turn and weakened. ESTIMATOR ZIGGY broke slowly, raced along the inner rail and was outrun. THE ICE MAN
CARLOS , three wide on the turn, gave way. BUDDY'S A CHARM , wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
SENATE CHAMBER edged up early and stalked in hand while saving ground, awaited room near the quarter pole, was afforded a path along the rail soon
into the lane, closed inside of rivals while under solid handling, put a head in front in deep stretch and prevailed. UNLEVERAGED broke a bit slow then was
taken wide and settled leaving the chute, crept up four wide leaving the far turn, angled out and circled five wide into the lane, rolled up outside the dueling
leaders then cleared in mid stretch, drifted in a bit while confronted from his inside, battled gamely but wasn't quite good enough. SHOOT
THEMESSENGER angled in early and was urged along while off the pace, moved up past the three sixteenths, got through to the inside of runners soon
after and churned on to gain the show. PATRIOTIC PARTY drafted back off the early pace, raced outside a rival mid turn, swung out leaving the three
sixteenths, split horses near the sixteenth marker and continued on with effort. CLAW prompted the pace outside HELMS DEEP, shifted out a path and bid
between runners entering the lane, fought on to mid stretch then faded late. TAUBER , three wide leaving the far turn, edged up some mid turn, swung out
five wide for the drive, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. HELMS DEEP sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, was guided two wide while
pressured into the lane, stayed on with effort to mid stretch then gave way. THE CAIRO KID rated in range while off the rail, bid four wide outside runners
into the lane, vied, failed to kick on in mid stretch then tired.

BREAK THE CHAINS bumped with IN THE DANCE when bearing in at the break, made the early lead easily, was snugly rated along the inner rail, was set
down in upper stretch, drew off and was kept to his business in the drive. IN THE DANCE , bumped and pinched back at the start, in the three path between
horses around the turn, swung outside in mid stretch and rallied. MASAKADO bumped IN THE DANCE when bearing out at the break, prompted the pace
outside the winner and gradually weakened through the stretch. ONE WAY FARRIOR , four deep chasing the pace around the turn, raced on his left lead in
the stretch and weakened. KING'S RIVER bobbled slightly at the break, saved ground on the turn, swung to the five path entering the stretch and came up
empty. EYES ELEVEN , checked on rival's heels near the six furlong pole, dropped back.

CALL ANOTHER PLAY rated close to a three pronged pace battle while saving ground, eased out into the lane, bid between rivals past the quarter pole,
wrested a short lead nearing the furlong grounds, responded when seriously set down and pulled away under a drive. SKY VICTORY grabbed command
leaving the chute and set a pressured pace to the inside of a pair of rivals, was nicely rated around the turn, shook clear when asked into the lane, dug in
when confronted near the three sixteenths, battled inside the winner past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was well clear for the place. FEELIN SO
LUCKY , four wide outside rivals contesting the pace, was ridden along into the lane, stayed on willingly past mid stretch then faded late. DETERMINED
BLUE came out soon after the break and bumped with MOM'S OPAL, raced three wide between foes early, dropped back under some coaxing leaving the
far turn, shifted out in the stretch and had a mild response. MOM'S OPAL , bumped at the break, regrouped and angled in, edged up while saving ground
mid turn, chased the leaders past the three sixteenths then came up empty. MOMMA'S LINO caught two to three wide and between runners, disputed the
pace into and around the turn, was under a hearty ride nearing the lane, failed to kick on leaving the quarter pole and gave way. LISA'S PALACE , between
foes early, raced three wide leaving the far turn and faded. NEOLITHICA rated five wide outside foes early on, dropped in a bit and stalked outside a rival
mid turn, came back out five wide for the drive, lacked a punch then gave way under some hand urging.

WEST STAR , steadied on the heels of OBOY near the five eighths pole, hugged the inner rail around the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch, split
horses approaching the sixteenth pole and drove clear. SHOULDHAVEBEENGONE lacked speed, circled the turn four wide, floated to the seven path in

bid for the lead in mid stretch and finished willingly. THE GREAT GAZOO , a forward factor in the two path around the turn, moved up between foes in mid
stretch and flattened out. BOLD HONOR raced in the four path leaving the turn, moved out in upper stretch and failed to menace. DREAMS DELIVERED
hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace, was well positioned in mid stretch and flattened out. NEVER COAST bumped with FEDERAL OFFENSE at the
start, set the pace in the two path around the turn, was still clear in mid stretch and weakened late. OBOY angled in mid way down the backstretch, swung
to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a rally. FEDERAL OFFENSE bumped with NEVER COAST at the start, circled the turn four wide, pulled up lame

UP AGAINST IT , taken to rate four wide early on, commenced a run leaving the far turn, continued progress four wide and under a hustling ride past the
five sixteenths, bumped with MUSICAL HEART soon into the lane, forged to command outside rivals leaving the three sixteenths then edged away under a
drive. MUSICAL HEART , three wide, took closer order after a half mile, drifted out a bit and bumped with the winner in upper stretch, straightened then
threatened between foes, stayed on as the winner cleared leaving the eighth pole and just saved the place. FUN LOVIN CRIMINAL was steadied back off
foes leaving the five eighths, saved ground past the three eighths, worked outward in the drive and finished well. HOTPOT steadied at the start, lagged back
early on while off the inside, circled five to six wide into the lane and closed steadily. SHIVAREE edged up while saving ground into the turn, was coaxed
along stalking the leader mid turn, came out for the drive and churned on between rivals. ADDY'S LADDY T N T accelerated inside rivals leaving the chute
and opened up a solid lead, set the pace towards the rail, maintained the advantage into the stretch, failed to contain the winner leaving the three
sixteenths, kept on past mid stretch then faded late. BIG ROWDY DAN , between foes edging up past the five eighths, stumbled when in tight nearing the
turn, dropped back, shifted in and had some late effort. CLUBMAN , four to five wide off the pace, lacked a rally. RAHMER saved ground leaving the far turn
and faded. An objection by the rider of BIG ROWDY DAN against MUSICAL HEART alleging interference near the half mile pole was not allowed.

Footnotes
WESTERN LANE trailed early off the rail and under coaxing through the backstretch run, angled out when gathering momentum near the three eighths,
circled six wide into the stretch, leveled off to her best stride while under a drive leaving mid stretch, surged outside foes to take command inside the
sixteenth marker then drew clear. SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE saved ground leaving the five eighths, came out for room leaving the far turn, advanced four
wide outside foes entering the stretch, closed steadily, could not match strides with the winner to her outside but kept on willingly to nab the place. NINJA
ABARRIO settled outside rivals, responded when given her cue and quickly bid three deep near the five sixteenths, moved clear and shifted in towards the
rail entering the lane, kept on under a drive past mid stretch, failed to fend off the winner past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly.
FLOWERDEW rated inside, moved up past the five sixteenths, steadied briefly near the quarter pole, eased out and came up empty. ROWSIE EXPRESS
stalked off the rail, closed in and briefly threatened between rivals near the five sixteenths, gave hard chase into and through the lane then faded late.
BROOKLYN GIRL , in a bit tight at the break, raced off the pace while saving some ground, swung wide for the drive and failed to menace. GILDA'S GIRL ,
between rivals, shifted in nearing the lane and gave way. MAJOR HOULIHAN opened up early, set the pace just off the inside, was collared after six
furlongs, came two wide into the lane and tired. THE HAUNTED ROOM , three wide outside a rival pursuing, faltered leaving the three eighths pole.
