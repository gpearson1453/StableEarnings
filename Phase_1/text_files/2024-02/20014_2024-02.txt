IT UP raced in the four path early, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the four and five path,
raced into traffic while starting a bid nearing the quarter pole, bumping with several rivals at that point and flattened out from there. ARTIFACT (GB) raced in
the four path around the first bend, pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dropped back while racing in the five path around the far turn,
bumped with several horses entering the stretch and continued to tire in the lane. FACCIA BELLA raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second turn in the six path, raced into traffic and bumped with several rivals near the quarter pole
and was empty from there. CLASSIC VINYL raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in
the two path and was never a factor.
