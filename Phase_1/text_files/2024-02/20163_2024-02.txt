Footnotes
AWESOME PRINCE pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and held clear to the wire. LINO'S KID
bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated the bend from
the three path and improved position in the lane. WILD TIME raced off the pace on the inside through the opening stages, continued around the turn in the
three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and gained ground late. ACTION DREAM bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in
the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and finished evenly. ETRETAT
bumped with the horse to his inside at the break, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the three path
and made no bid. SHIPWRECK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came around the bend in the two path and weakened in the stretch.
UNIQUE PATH bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four
path and faded in the lane. ERUDITE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.

OBSTREPEROUS led the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and in upper stretch and shook clear late. ALMA PURA chased
the leader up the backstretch, challenged while saving ground around the bend, dueled in upper stretch and could not go with the winner late but kept on to
the wire. ROSE VIEW hit the gate leaving it, bumping with the horse to her inside and veering out at the break, raced off the pace on the outside early, came
around the turn in the four path and improved position in the lane. MISS CLAUDETTE raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the
bend from the two path and improved position from there. STATELY APRIL bumped with the horse to her outside at the start, raced in the middle of the
pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly. HARD SPICE raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the turn in the four path and never threatened. AU PAIR raced off the pace on the
inside early, navigated the bend from the two path and showed no kick. MORNING REFLECTION tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the three path and weakened in the stretch. BAHAMIAN BABY stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came
around the turn in the three path and faded in the lane. KITTEN raced at the back of the pack through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three
path and made no bid. PATARA raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and tired in
the stretch. DIAMOND ROMANCE trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was never a factor.
