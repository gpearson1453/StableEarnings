DESHAMBEAU stalked the pace, raced four wide near the quarter pole and finished strongly to draw off under steady handling. TEXTHELEGEND sent
early but raced near the back early, eased out five wide in the stretch and finished well to rally for the place position. ORTH showed good early foot to set
the pace, challenged through the far turn and weakened the final eighth of a mile racing three wide. THIRSTY JOHN rated along under a hold, ridden near
the seven sixteenths pole and faded in the drive.
