ASENA tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, began a bid passing the quarter pole and dueled to the
wire to get up for the win late. COCKTAIL SLIPPERS dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the two path and continued to
battle to the wire, getting caught in late stretch. MISS UNION stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, navigated the bend from the
four path, drifted in in upper stretch, losing his whip in the process and gained ground late from there. COASTLINE HOTTIE raced off the pace on the
outside early, continued around the turn in the two path, raced in tight quarters in midstretch and kept on from there. GO GO SADIE dueled on the outside
up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and weakened in the stretch. RANEEM raced off the pace on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the bend, raced in tight quarters and was forced to check at the eighth pole and showed no kick from there. THE RIDER
OF HORSE TWO, RANEEM, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE FOUR, MISS UNION, CITING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW,
HORSE FOUR, MISS UNION, WAS DISQUALFIED AND PLACED LAST FOR INTERFERENCE.

Footnotes
TENTH STREET DON raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming around the turn, began a bid
passing the quarter pole and gained ground late to get up for the win. FLEET OF FLAGS led the way on the outside up the backstretch, came around the
bend in the four path, dug in in the lane and was caught late. O'BANION (IRE) stalked the leader on the inside through the opening quarter, navigated the
turn from the three path and kept on to the wire. ROBO WARRIOR raced off the pace on the outside early, began a bid coming around the turn, entered the
stretch in the six path and improved position from there. ROYAL HALO tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path
coming around the bend and was outkicked in the lane. J C'S A LEGEND chased the leader on the outside through the early going, came around the turn in
the six path and weakened in the stretch. PASSION OF JOE'S pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path
and faded in the lane. COASTAL FOG raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and made no bid. INCREDIBE
MO pressed the pace on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch.
