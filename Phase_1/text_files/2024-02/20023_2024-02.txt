Footnotes
INTO IT broke in and bumped rival, sat off the pace in the two path, moved into range on the far turn, launched a bid splitting the leaders approaching the
eighth pole, took over shortly after and drew away. NATIONAL GENERAUX (IRE) stalked along the rail to the far turn, tipped out late on the bend and came
three wide into the stretch, moved out further to challenge four deep with a furlong remaining but got outkicked by the winner. MY PARTNER GLEN sat off
the pace next to the fence, ridden along through the far turn then asked left handed leaving the bend, ran into traffic briefly in upper stretch, then kept on
once in the clear and gained the show. STREET HUMOR broke well then took a stalking position in the two path, challenged from outside at the
three-eighths pole, carried a short lead into the stretch, fought between rivals with a furlong left to run, lost command midstretch and flattened to fourth.
FORE FLAG cleared and crossed over to the inside, showed the way to the far turn, challenged by outer rival around that bend, gave up the lead
approaching the stretch, fought back into the furlong grounds and weakened. HARD MISSION took a bump from the winner in the beginning, stalked in the
two path, steered out to the four path entering the lane, drifted in some in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. SUPERMAX hit the gate to lose a
step at the start, trailed two wide into the first turn then moved inside, continued on the fence through the far turn at the back, eased in the lane and walked
off.

GYPSY LYNN pressed the pace from outside, move up on even terms three to four wide on the turn, led three wide into the stretch, put away TROUBLE N
PARADISE at the eight pole and drew off. TROUBLE N PARADISE set the pace under pressure from GYPSY LYNN up the backstretch, dueled two to three
wide around the turn, lost command leaving the bend, could not kick on with the winner at the eighth pole, grew a bit weary late but managed to hold
second. KEEP YOUR COIL chased on the inside into the turn, got crowded a bit past the three-eighths pole, angled out and came three to four wide into the
stretch, kept on through the lane and gained the show. MANGO MOON broke outward, chased the top pair outside a rival into the turn, moved over to the
inside at the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened down the lane. SUGAR SUGAR also broke out, trailed three wide into the turn, moved into the two path
midway around the bend then angled four wide past the quarter pole, moved inward in upper stretch and failed to menace.

OOBUBBAKAKAYO brushed inner rival, rated along the inside to the turn, tipped to the two path at the quarter pole, drew alongside TRAVELIN' SHOW in
upper stretch, dueled through the final furlong edged the runner-up. TRAVELIN' SHOW stepped to the front then took control of the rail, inched away briefly
on the turn, challenged from outside in upper stretch, resisted through the final furlong and yielded grudgingly in the end. DRIVE FOR SHOW tracked two
then three wide around the bend and failed to produce a bid in the stretch run. TROTSKY raced off the rail near the back, went two wide into the turn,
moved out to the four path for a bit before angling to the three path leaving the bend, kept on for a minor award but failed to threaten. PUDDIN HEAD
JONES brushed leaving the gate, settled at the back early, moved closer along the rail into the turn and had to pause momentarily when in tight at the
three-eighths pole, continued to save ground to the stretch and could not make an impact. CLUBHOUSE CHARLIE closest in pursuit to the outside of the
pacesetter to the turn, chased two wide around the bend and weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
SAKURA BLOSSOM sat off the pace in the early going, made progress along the rail on the turn before angling three wide into the stretch, put a head in
front at the eighth pole, cleared shortly after and held safely. PINK WHITNEY chased just out of range up the backstretch, navigated the turn four then five
wide, finished willingly and gained the place. DEFICIT MAJA broke a step slow, trailed three wide into the turn, angled over to the rail around the bend,
challenged from inside with a furlong remaining but was outkicked by the top pair. ASIAN MATRIARCH raced in range two wide leaving the backstretch,
moved out late on the bend and came four wide into the stretch, chased within striking distance at the eighth pole but needed to find more late. SHE'S MY
NIECE closest in pursuit from the two path, confronted the leader entering the lane, took over briefly outside the eighth pole, lost command at the marker
and flattened late. TOULOUSE DETRAC grabbed the early lead and set the tone from inside, roused on the turn, tested from outside rival entering the lane,
relinquished the lead approaching the eighth pole and weakened. PANDA PEAK chased three wide into the turn, lost positions around the bend and trailed
four wide into the lane and tired in the stretch.

PLAYER B away quickly from inside then raced up close stalking the pacesetter, bid two wide midway around the bend, took over exiting the turn, kicked
clear in upper stretch and was ridden out to the wire. PETCOFF tracked two wide into the turn, angled out into the stretch, rallied outside rivals and gained
second, unsaddled on the backstretch and walked into the van. CAPTAIN CHOOCHIES brushed with inner rival at the start, stalked outside a rival, spun
three wide into the lane, chased between late and got edged for second. DEVILISH DESIRE stalked along the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch and
needed to find more in the final furlong. UNCLE REG traveled in mid-pack early, went two wide into the turn, angled out leaving the bend and failed to
threaten. ALPHA OMEGA broke a bit slow, hustled to the front, cleared inner rival after a briefly duel, cut across to the inside, challenged at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost command into the stretch and weakened down the lane. PRECISION STRIKE brushed with outer rival at the start, settled inside,
ridden along saving ground around the bend and lacked a rally. METEOR MAN was off slow then came in shortly after the start, trailed on the inside then
two wide into the stretch and could not make an impact. MR. MENDELSSOHN was off slow from outside, raced well off the pace to the turn, traveled along

Footnotes
DISOBEY set the pace inside ANTONSEN early, dueled with that rival into and around the bend, inched ahead in upper stretch, shook free midstretch and
edged away. ANTONSEN pressed the pace from outside, dueled into and around the bend, kept the pressure on to the eighth pole, then was no match for
the winner in the furlong grounds. PRATCHETT stalked the top pair two wide into the turn, took aim three wide entering the stretch but failed to produce a
bid. GETEMDUSTY raced outside a rival at the back, advanced three then two wide around the bend and kept on to pick up a minor award. DANGEROUS
GAME climbed at the back early, trailed two then three wide, improved position in the drive but never threatened. THEGINGERBREADMAN climbed early
when losing his path, chased along the inside off the pace, came out approaching the stretch and failed to menace. HUNGRY HEARTS broke a step slow,
chased three wide into the turn, four wide turning for home and weakened. SPEND IT ALL chased four wide around the bend, five wide into the stretch,
drifted to the inside and had little left for the final furlong.

outkicked in the final sixteenth. MARKS HIP showed good early foot and established the front, set the pace on the inside, padded the lead in the middle
stages, held a diminished entering the lane, tested from outside in upper stretch and relinquished the lead at the eighth pole, then stayed on gamely through
the final furlong for a minor award. MIDNIGHT JOSTAR brushed with inner rival at the start, reserved in the beginning and moved into the two path, ran up
on heels on the clubhouse turn, drifted in and made light contact with rival at the half-mile pole, moved out and went four deep around the far turn and
improved position the stretch run. FLY THE SKY tracked two wide around the clubhouse turn, moved out three deep on the backstretch, rounded the far
