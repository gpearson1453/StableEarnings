Footnotes
KEEN CAT unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the inside, angled out around the final turn, entered the stretch four wide, rallied and was going away at
the end. UNCLE FRANK challenged for the early lead, saved ground throughout, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. DAVIDIC
LINE pressed the pace, raced three wide around the final turn and lacked a late kick, proving third best. FAHAN raced within striking distance in the
beginning, had an outside trip and was no real factor. SECRET VISTA lacked early speed and was never close. GOLD CRUSHER dueled for the early lead
and made a steady retreat.

bumped at the start, raced within contention, saved ground around the turn, finished willingly and was a clear second. ZIPPING MOLLY lacked early speed,
made a steady gain and proved no match for the top two. SHARE THE DOE raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and hung. BELL PEPPER void
of early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. FLYING I vied for the early lead and faded. WHERESTHECARTGIRL dueled on the front end, raced
three wide around the turn and retreated. BOSTON BELLE lacked early speed and was never close. NATURALBORNSENDER bumped at the start, raced
within striking distance and dropped back. KIMBERLY'S JACKPOT raced near the back and was never a threat.

Footnotes
TWO WORLDS vied for the early lead, dueled with I WILL STAND throughout and prevailed for the win. I WILL STAND challenged for the early lead, dueled
throughout, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others. VANGILDER lacked early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid,
proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. BIRTHDAY PARTY lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, made a mild bid,
racing wide, but was no factor. TAPPIN FORA DANCE raced in the middle of the field, came around the final turn on the outside and put forth an even
effort. BIG BROTHER void of early speed and passed tired ones. DOUBLE TRAP raced near the middle of the field and weakened. HULLINAHURRY
pressed the early pace and dropped back. TENSAS TODDY raced within contention, retreated to the rear and was outrun.

TENNESSEE MOON went to the front, being challenged by BLUE RIDGE QUEEN, drove clear, pulled away down the home stretch and proved much the
best. BLESSED ANNA raced in the middle of the field, moved up on the outside around the second turn, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner,
but was a clear second. XCARET raced within contention, came around the final turn on the outside, was close throughout and proved third best at the wire.
MISS DARLENE broke poorly, racing in the rear, had an outside trip, gained ground, but was no factor. BAR TAP raced near the middle of the field, came
around the second turn on the outside and put forth an even effort. BLUE RIDGE QUEEN challenged on the front end in the beginning and faded. SAENZ
raced within striking distance and faded. GLANCE raced near the middle of the field, weakened and was never a threat. ROSES ARE GRAY always raced
near the back and showed little. KATIE'S KARAT lacked early speed, lost contact with the field and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
HART'S PRETTY GIRL went to the front, drove clear, saved ground, dueled late, was all out and held on for the win. PORTO DEL ACE lacked early speed,
made a steady gain, came up the rail down the home stretch and needed more ground, closing fast. BANDIT'S PRIDE pressed the pace, forwardly placed
throughout and proved no match for the top two. THE CALLING STONE was unruly in the gates, raced in the middle of the field, made a wide bid and was
outfinished for third. STHEPANIE PRINCESS pressed the early pace, weakened and lacked a late kick. MEGANS MILLIONS lacked early speed, improved
position, but was no factor. KAN SHE raced within striking distance in the beginning, came around the second turn on the outside and faded. MOLLI WAY
always raced near the back and was never a threat. NEW DESTINY raced in the middle of the pack and dropped back. RUNLIKELANIE broke a step slow,
racing from the back, had an outside trip and showed little.

TREASURE COAST pressed the pace, made a bid at the 3/4 pole, took the advantage and was caught late for second. R T'S D'ORO lacked early speed,
had an outside trip, showed late interest, but was no factor. LITTLE WARRIOR pressed the early pace, saved ground around the final turn and weakened.
PARTY GRAS lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn and was no threat. CALL ME FIREY raced in the middle of the pack and
weakened. CARLOS'S MAMA brushed at the start, void of early speed and was never close. STRAY CAT STRUT sprinted to the front, drove clear and
