Footnotes
FAST AND FRISKY wen to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival while off the rail, dropped to the rail before the three-eighths pole, responded
well when asked near the five-sixteenths, shook clear under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and held under steady urging. CALL HER BLUFF prompted the pace on the outside, was given her
cue in the three then two path on the turn, lost touch with the winner in upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. CALLING AN AUDIBLE
tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, chased in the four then three path on the turn, came under the crop outside the
quarter-pole, dropped back under a drive in upper stretch and tired while clear for the show. BROOKLYN DANTZ settled off the pace, was coaxed along
passing the five-eighths pole, raced between horses in the two path leaving the backstretch, dropped back nearing the three-eighths pole then shifted to the
four path, moved to the five path later on the bend and came up empty. DETONATE settled off the pace, was coaxed along late on the backstretch, dropped
back while saving ground on the turn and capitulated. POSEIDON'S MIST settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, turned into the
stretch in the three path while under the crop and failed to respond.

Footnotes
AMERICAN MONARCH coaxed from the gate, dueled from the four path down the backstretch with JOEY FRESHWATER to his inside, shook off that rival
near the seven-sixteenths and was engaged by SPUN AND WON midway on the turn, knocked heads with that foe and cornered just off the inside into
upper stretch, got roused with three-sixteenths to go and dug in under a drive gamely rebuffing the runner up to the finish. SPUN AND WON five paths off
the inside down the backstretch just off the duel, tucked three wide and advanced into the turn to duel with the aforementioned foe with three furlongs to run,
came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in latched on and fighting on to the finish but was ultimately
repelled to the wire. NOVA RAGS coaxed from the start, chased five then four wide down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn
coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, cornered three to four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors while never threatening
the top pair. JOEY FRESHWATER coaxed from the gate, dueled three then two wide with AMERICAN MONARCH to his outside, got shaken off with
seven-sixteenths to run, angled to the inside midway on the turn, spun two to three wide for home and weakened. HE'SMYHONEYBADGER coaxed from
the start, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened.

Footnotes
LORD GATLING broke out then bobbled, stalked the pace on the outside, pounced on the leader while in the two path on the turn, gained the advantage
just inside the five-sixteenths, shook clear in the three path at the quarter-pole then drew away while drifting out, took a straighter course beginning outside
the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best. SWIFT TAP was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, lost the
lead inside the five-sixteenths, shifted four wide into the stretch and proved no match for the winner while just able to get the place. MY FRIENDS BEER
settled just off the pace, was urged two then three wide on the turn, came four wide into the stretch then moved further out and just missed the place while
clear for the show. BLAKE B. settled between foes, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths then moved out, dropped from the three path to the rail on the
turn and failed to respond. FOREVER WICKED broke a step slow, dropped far behind while racing well outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and showed little. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY settled just off the pace, dropped back while inside to the two path on the turn and faltered.

CEES GET DEGREES established the front just after the break and showed the way in hand just off the inside patiently handled until set down continuing
just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive holding well and safe to the finish kept to task. TETSU chased four wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, ran on under a drive through to the finish latched on the aforementioned foe through the final furlong but
was ultimately rebuffed to the finish. SEVEN NATION ARMY chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch and improved position to secure the show honors. JEFF FA FA
coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace three wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, continued three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the
late stages. CLEM LABINE broke out at the start and was corrected, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into
upper stretch, tipped out to the seven or eight path a furlong out and offered up a mild bid. PRESIDENT Z got bumped at the start by DOT'S DOLLAR,
chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. DOT'S DOLLAR broke out at the
start bumping PRESIDENT Z, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
THIRTEEN RED FLAGS settled off the pace, was urged three wide on the turn, rallied under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, closed well to get the lead
into the final furlong, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole, shied out when given one pop of a left-handed crop shortly thereafter then was placed under a
strong hand-ride to the finish while best. SOHANA was hustled from the gate, moved out while chasing the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch,
went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch, gained into the final furlong and finished willingly for the place. SWEET BROWN SUGAR
was hustled from the gate, chased the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out in upper stretch and was along for
the show. ALLEY'S SONG was urged along near the back, went around the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and improved
position without threatening. MY PERFECT MISTAKE moved out early then was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and lacked the needed response. BUSTIN TIME came away well then moved in while going clear early, lost the lead outside the half-mile pole,
dropped back along the rail outside the three-eighths pole then shifted to the two path, gained to re-engage the leader in the two path coming to the
five-sixteenths pole, took the advantage again outside the quarter-pole, was headed by the winner into the final furlong and tired. SOLOSHOT stumbled
some at the start but broke towards the front, chased the early pace, took the lead outside the half-mile pole, dropped from the two path to the rail while
briefly moving clear coming to the three-eighths pole, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, battled under a drive in upper stretch, dropped back into
the final furlong and capitulated. MYSARIA settled off the pace then dropped back, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and was
no factor.

stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get up late and prevail. GOT THUNDER moved up under urging then chased the pace, gained
two then three wide on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, took a short lead under the crop in the vicinity of the three-sixteenths, dueled with

three-sixteenths, edged clear under a drive kept to task. RUN DEVIL vied from the two path between foes among a quartet, then emerged to duel with
WHISTLER'S STYLE through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, yielded the front with
three-sixteenths to go and ran on to preserve the place honors over a rival at the finish. JACKIE THE JOKER chased three then two wide, came under
coaxing tucked inside at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, ran on down along the rail through to the finish and was clear for the
show honors. HALO CITY chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals to the finish.
ICY REPLY vied four wide down the backstretch outside a trio, came under coaxing at the three-eighths in the midst of being shaken off, went eight wide
into upper stretch and weakened. FREDDYMO FACTOR led early on and then vied three wide between rivals among a foursome down the backstretch,
came under coaxing near the three-eighths when in the midst of being shaken off, swung six wide into upper stretch and weakened. WHISTLER'S STYLE
coaxed from the gate, ranged up after the start to vie inside a trio down the backstretch, then emerged dueling with RUN DEVIL to her outside with three
furlongs to go and was placed to coaxing at that station, took the inside route into upper stretch beginning to back away, then tired through to the finish. A
NEW PEACE stumbled badly at the start and conceded five to six lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, chased along the inside, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact.
