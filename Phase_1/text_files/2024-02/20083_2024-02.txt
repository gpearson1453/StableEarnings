Footnotes
RAYMOND unruly prestart, broke alertly, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, came three wide for the drive, shook clear when
straightened for home. DRIFTER broke back, lacked early foot, closer in the two path, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late, clearly second
best. RIFEY broke back, lacked early foot just off the inside, swung out five wide turning for home, finished with some late energy to be in time for the show,
not a threat to the top two. CIBOLO forwardly placed while well out in the strip, five wide into the turn, contested the issue on the outside through the bend,
four wide into the stretch weakened in the run to the wire. STAND FOR FREEDOM vied up front between horses, four wide into the turn between horses,
also faltered. CLASSIC KING broke in air, lacked speed, four wide when moving a bit closer late in the turn, lacked a further bid. RARE STRIPE in mid pack
along the inside, saved ground to no avail. OTIS OTIS OTIS vied up front while between foes, stopped through the stretch, trailed home.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW BLESSINGS behind the early pace while well off the rail, ranged up closer four wide late in the turn, challenged on the outside of the first flight
entering the stretch, drove clear under steady handling. ZONGS IRISH FROST with the pace along the inside, narrowly showed the way into and through
the turn, offered brief resistance to the winner in upper stretch then proved no match, held sway late for the place. LATIFAH vied up front along the inside,
fell back and moved out to the two path turn, modest late interest but did not have enough for the place. BOOGIE ON off a step slow, raced back, came four
wide out of the turn, displayed some late energy to be gaining for the second spot late. GETOUTOFMYKITCHEN away in good order, with the pace while
between horses for a half, weakened in the drive. LIL' BIT OF CHROME broke back, lacked speed while just off the inside, continued in the two path
through the turn then failed to rally. WILD CHEROKEE broke on top, also forced or set the pace for a half while outside, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
HISSY MISSY broke on top, set the pace inside, extended advantage into far turn, turned back a rival from the outside, turning for home, allowed the runner
up the inside soon after, headed by that one with a sixteenth to run, battled back in game fashion to prevail. START SINGING broke in to bother
UNDECIDED, was straightened to track the pace inside, continued to save ground while within striking distance into the far turn, waited behind the lead
pack late in that bend, went through a narrow opening inside the winner past the furlong marker, put a head in front a sixteenth then was outfinished in the
late going. PRIDDIS behind the pace off the rail first turn, moved closer while continuing in the three path second turn, vied into the lane, drifted out past the
furlong marker, weakened a bit but managed to save the show. MISS DISTINCTIVE narrowly headed up the second fight while between horses, moved
closer second turn, challenged then gradually weakened through the lane. BEACHGRASS fell back to trail after the start, improved position just off the
inside into the stretch, flattened out a bit and was never a serious threat. INVALUABLE settled in mid pack while off the inside, had little for the drive.
UNDECODED bothered at the start to be last away, was finished early, raced back. STOIC LUNA four wide through the turns, backed up stretch.

Footnotes
SHAKE UP broke on top, allowed the early leader to go, chased that one into the turn off the inside, dueled into the stretch, shook that same rival off to be
clear approaching the furlong marker, maintained daylight to the wire under pressure. CHOCTAW ZIP forwardly placed along the inside, steered out a bit to
be in the two path into the lane, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one the final furlong, clearly second best. YAQUI
VALLEY moved up to take command after the start, set the pace for a half along the inside, could not match the top two in the drive, narrowly saved the
show. CHUPAPI MUNYAYO last away, lacked early foot, in a bit tight while advancing from between horses late in the turn, flattened out in the drive. THIRD
WATCH in the second flight along the inside, had little for the drive. PEPPERONIKID off the pace inside,steered three wide late in the turn, lacked rally.
CYBERTOWN bothered soon after the start, moved outside, four to five wide exiting the turn, improve position by passing mostly tiring rivals. I'M AN OAK
floated in after the start, remained back in making in the way of an impact. PARTYINTHESTREETS in mid pack off the rail, three to four wide out of the turn,
tired. RUDIANO in tight at the break, moved up to mid pack, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S CAUSE tracked the first flight in the three path for a half, tipped out five wide turning for home when moving to challenge, took over nearing the
furlong grounds, quickly clear, held the runner up at bay late while inside that one. LAURA BRANIGAN void of speed along the inside, also angled out to be
five wide while behind the winner entering the stretch, challenged outside that rival, too late. LIL TOWN SIS off a step slow, raced back and inside, angled
out sharply then was fanned six wide exiting the turn, remained widest through the stretch, closed the gap on the top two inside the furlong marker then
flattened out a bit in the final strides. GREEK HEIRESS vied up front while four wide for a half, began to weaken when headed by the winner in upper
stretch, continued to gradually give way. FLOATING with the pace while three wide and between horses, faltered in the drive. WEATHER MAP had speed
for a half between horses and then backed up. OH MY GAWD flashed speed for a half along the inside and stopped.

Footnotes
KHOZY MY BOY unhurried early inside, began to advance second turn, angled out, bumped with LEADER OF MEN into the stretch when attempting to split
horses, stalled then angled to the rail, finished with good energy up the inside to be in time. LEADER OF MEN four wide into the first turn, angled in to save
ground, continued inside onto the backstretch, also advanced through the second bend, challenged four wide into the lane, bumped with the winner entering
the stretch, continued to vie, gained the advantage late but could not contain the winner. MAN ON THE MOON chased the dueling leaders just off the
inside, advanced on that pair into the far turn, challenged between horses, brushed as a result of the contact between the top pair into the stretch, held a
small advantage a furlong out, weakened slightly late while remaining well clear off the rest. SMOKIN' HOT broke on top, dueled off the inside through some
quick early fractions, put the other speed away far turn, responded when challenged by a pair of foes soon after, vied into the stretch in the two path,
faltered the final furlong. MAKE NOISE lacked speed toward the inside, two to three path in the final turn, lacked a closing punch. TURN ON THE MAGIC off
a step slow, raced back, saved ground through the second turn, improved position through the stretch while not making a serious impact. ROYAL ACT off a
step slow, void of speed, four wide turns, lacked a rally. RIVER BOY in mid pack early, fell back before a half and was never a threat. DEVOTED TO YOU
dueled up front along the inside for five furlongs, first to blink. BABA'S BOY main group while 5 into first turn, gave way after half. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN OUT OF THE FINAL TURN AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF THE RUNNER UP AGAINST
THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ENTERING THE STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
POPPERINA off a bit slow, raced back early, closer turn off the inside, waited briefly entering the stretch, three deep bid upper stretch, quickly clear late in a
promising debut. VICKI ROSE behind the leaders inside, also closed the gap on the first flight late turn, in traffic inside the winner into the lane, remained
inside, squeezed through a narrow opening inside a tiring rival a furlong out, continued with resolve to the wire to narrowly prevail for the second spot, no
threat to the winner. ALICIT INTENTION off a bit slow with the winner, lacked speed, two path through the turn, rallied through the lane, narrowly missed the
place while remaining off the inside. HURRICANE FIRE away best of all, dueled up front off the inside, briefly responded when confronted by the winner
nearing the furlong grounds, weakened, caught for the place. BOLD APPEAL in the second flight off the rail, three wide through the turn, lacked a serious
closing response. LADY MOSCATO within striking distance outside, four to five wide through the turn, weakened in the drive. BELLAJU away in good order,
alternated up front closest to the inside, was weakening when put in tight by the runner up between horses nearing the furlong marker, continued to give
way to the wire. CHURCH SERVICE fell back to trail after the start and was not involved. PER RULING ECM2024-79 FROM HIWU, VICKI ROSE WAS
DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
XTREME DIVA outrun in the early out in the strip, advanced four wide through the turn, put a head in front nearing the furlong marker, proved determined
late to narrowly prevail. BLUE SQUALL within striking distance on the outside, chased the leader through the turn, challenged into the stretch in the three
path, responded when challenged by the winner with a furlong to run, dueled to the wire inside that one and just missed in a game effort. TANYA
SHOWERS broke well, fell back off the pace to trail, angled out a bit to be four wide into the lane, shifted out a bit more to be widest, moved closer then
drifted in a bit a sixteenth out lacked a winning punch down the middle of the strip, just up for the place. XTREME SMOKE SHOW forwardly placed early
inside, steadied inside the leader into the turn, continued to save ground after recovering, bothered when the tiring leader came in past the furlong marker,
moved out, missed the show. SHARP TUNE broke with the leaders, showed the way up the backstretch in the two path, continued to set the pace turn, was
beginning to tire when headed nearing midstretch, drifted in and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
INDIAN GULCH unhurried for six furlongs, angled out when beginning to advance late in the final turn, steered out further to be widest in the drive, closed
with good resolve to be up in time. NEPAL UP also lacked speed early, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside and rallied up the rail to
annex the place. COACH ADAMS away in good order, set the pace while in hand, continued to show the way into the stretch, allowed the runner up the
inside past the furlong marker, outkicked by that one for the place. NAMESAKE pressed the issue up front in the two path,continued to apply pressure into
the lane, weakened gradually, outkicked for the show. CITY LEGEND in the second flight while inside, following the leader through the second turn in hand,
moved out for room into the stretch, brushed with T BONES TRICK upper stretch then lacked a closing punch. T BONES TRICK prompted the pace three
wide, brushed upper stretch, had little left for the run to the wire. R DOC in mid pack early while well out in the strip, moved a bit closer four wide through the
second turn, faded through the stretch. SEASIDE BOY last away, trailed, fell further back, jogged in late to be well beaten.
