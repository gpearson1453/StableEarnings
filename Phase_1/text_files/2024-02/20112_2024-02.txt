narrowly miss. PRINCE OTTO stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position
in late stretch. TALE OF TRUTH raced off the pace on the outside early, continued around the bend in the four path and never threatened. ROUGE
SUNSET bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the
turn in the two path and showed no kick. IMPASSIONED CLAIM bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, tracked the leader on the inside up
