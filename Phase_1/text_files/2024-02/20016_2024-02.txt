strides to the wire while well clear of the rest for the place honors. EXTRA DIRTY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. BROWN AS A BISCUIT bobbled at the start, chased along the inside and then
just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and offered no response. UNION BELLE tossed her head at
the start and got away last, chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered just off the inside

Footnotes
RACING COLORS settled towards the rear, angled in late on the backstretch, was roused while moving from three to five wide on the turn, rallied outside
coming to the quarter-pole, gained fast under the crop to make a bid into upper stretch, took over inside the three-sixteenths pole, shook clear inside the
furlong marker while remaining on her inside lead, swapped to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away under steady handling. REIGNING
CHICK moved up near the three-quarter pole, contested the pace between horses, was asked in the three path on the turn, turned into upper stretch on
even terms for the lead, battled with the winner under a drive into the final furlong and proved no match while able to hold the place. SAIL WITH THE WIND
settled well back in the field, moved in with five furlongs to run, was ridden along in the two path on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was along
for the show. SHIGEKO was hustled from the gate, moved out early, advanced under urging near the three-quarter pole, contested the pace on the outside
of three opponents, chased in the four path on the turn and tired. LADY FORTUNA settled off the pace, drifted out near the five-eighths pole then dropped
back under strong urging, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to respond. JACKSON'S DIXIE moved up near the three-quarter pole, contested the
pace between horses, vied in the two path while asked on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. CHASING DAYLIGHT went to the front,
dropped in near the three-quarter pole, lost the lead briefly inside that pole then was urged to regain a narrow advantage, disputed the pace inside of three
rivals, vied along the rail under urging on the turn, dropped back at the five-sixteenths pole and stopped then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
CENTAVO tossed his head and had the rider fall back in the saddle briefly in the early going, went around the first turn in the two path, settled in a good
position, drafted in the two path on the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, closed fast to get the lead inside the
three-sixteenths-pole, battled outside of two opponents into the final furlong then moved clear under strong urging. NIGHT EFFECT went straight to the
front, dropped from the two path to near the inside on the first turn, showed the way on the inside of a foe, was asked in the two path while under threat on
the far turn, lost the advantage nearing the quarter-pole, fought on into the final furlong then was outfinished but just held the place. PROVEN HOPE went
four wide on the first turn, settled comfortably on the outside, moved closer with five furlongs to run, was asked leaving the backstretch, gained to make a
bid in the four path midway through the far turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, dropped to the three path into the stretch, battled under a drive
into the final furlong and was also outfinished then just missed the place while well clear for the show. STJAMES was hustled from the gate, saved ground
on the first turn, settled off the rail at the rear, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, went two then three wide on the far turn and lacked the needed
response. JUNGFRAU was hustled from the gate, went three wide while taken under a strong hold on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was
asked between foes in the three path on the far turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. GRANDPA'S KID raced inside to the two path on the first turn,
settled near the back, saved ground under urging on the far turn and failed to respond.

KAZ SUGAR BANK got bumped at the start by P MONEY, who broke in a step at the start, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied and was up in the last jumps to score. DR. KRAFT chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying but missed at the end. FORTUNE'S NEPHEW coaxed from the start, raced
three wide in aim of the leader pulling a bit eager early on, tucked to the two path into the turn and advanced to take over command seven-sixteenths from
home, came under coaxing and swung two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive switching leads a furlong out when growing a bit weary,
then drifted out late when under challenge from a pair, got caught and was corrected before contact could be made with DR. KRAFT in the final strides to
the wire. P MONEY broke in a step at the start bumping KAZ SUGAR BANK, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide for home, kept on under a drive but was outkicked to the finish. PLEASE BE NICE stumbled at the start, established the front shortly after
and showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside into the turn and yielded the front with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered.

took the lead into upper stretch, battled outside of the runner-up while remaining on her inside lead in the drive and prevailed under steady urging. MUSIC
MELODY chased the pace, made a bid in the three path early on the turn, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, battled inside of the winner
into the final sixteenth and was outfinished while well clear for the place. LUMENIQUE was slow into stride then dropped well behind under urging, went two
to three wide on the turn and improved to just get the show. STAMP OF APPROVAL was well placed just off the pace, came under urging while two then
three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. THE TACO LADY moved out while
urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to rally. SARIR was hustled to the front, showed the
way under urging, vied inside to the two path while roused for more on the turn, lost the advantage nearing the quarter-pole and tired. YAY HOORAY

NEWPORT BRIDGE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying
to take command a sixteenth out, then inched away in the late stages kept to task. DADS GOOD RUNNER chased three to four wide coming under coaxing
near the five-sixteenths, took over command inside that station and swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat to the outside, got collared a
sixteenth from home and ran on willingly to the finish. BEARY FUNNY coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the

Footnotes
COPPA GIRL went three wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, took the lead nearing the half-mile pole, vied in the two path on the far
turn, shook clear under a strong hand-ride inside the three-sixteenths then came under a left-handed crop and drew away under strong urging. SWEET
MYSTERY bumped with a foe into the first turn, moved from the two path to the four path on that bend, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid late on
the backstretch, vied outside the winner in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch under the crop, dropped back into the final furlong
and proved no match while clear for the place. TONED UP went around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the back, was urged while moving from
three to five wide on the far turn and was along for the show. ESSAOUIRA went four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under urging late on
the backstretch, traveled four wide on the far turn and lacked the needed response. MYTOWN MYRULES was coaxed to the front, dropped to the rail early
on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead coming to the half-mile pole, dropped back along the rail under urging on the far turn
and tired. RAYYA VALENTINE moved from the inside to the two path on the first turn, was well placed just off the pace, dropped back in the two path on the
final turn and capitulated. I FEEL THE NEED dropped back between horses after the start, lagged well behind, raced in the two path on the turns and was
eased but walked off. CARAGATE moved from the rail to the three path on the first turn, settled towards the rear, went two to three wide on the far turn and
faltered then was also eased but walked off.

Footnotes
SAINT GAUDENS broke in at the start bumping BERNING BEAUTY, then got steadied when rivals outside came inwards, raced five wide in closest aim of
the leader down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home and advanced to take over the front inside that station, shook away through
the turn and took the inside route into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. MERLIN'S MOMENT broke in at the start bumping AVA'S UNCLE
BILLY into OUTTAWATERBURY, chased seven then six wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top one and offered up a mild kick. QUIET WISDOM chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued wide for home, proved
no match for the top one, ran on to secure the show honors. BIG EGO broke in at the start bumping THIS TIME YES, chased six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and weakened. LAND D'ORO
chased along the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped out when SOLO EMPIRE backed away three furlongs out putting CHARLES J
briefly in tight between rivals near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the stretch. BERNING BEAUTY got
bumped at the start by SAINT GAUDENS breaking inwards, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and weakened. OUTTAWATERBURY got bumped at the start by AVA'S UNCLE BILLY due to pressure from MERLIN'S MOMENT
breaking inwards, chased along the inside down the backstretch before tipping three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
angled four wide at the top of the stretch and tired. AVA'S UNCLE BILLY got bumped at the start by MERLIN'S MOMENT and in turn bumped the
aforementioned foe, chased three to four wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. CHARLES J chased three
then two wide, came under coaxing briefly at the three-eighths, got paused when placed in tight between foes with five-sixteenths to go as LAND D'ORO
tipped out from along the rail when SOLO EMPIRE backed away midway on the turn, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. THIS TIME YES got
bumped at the start by BIG EGO breaking inwards and in turn forced SAINT GAUDENS to steady in tight between foes, chased along the inside coming
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and made no impact. SOLO EMPIRE showed speed showing the way just off
the inside in hand for the opening half mile, tucked inside and had the eventual winner take over just inside that station, faded under light coaxing through
the turn, cornered just off the inside at the head of the stretch and folded.
