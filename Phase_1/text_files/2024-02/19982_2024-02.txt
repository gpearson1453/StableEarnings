Footnotes
FASHIONISTA stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the far turn and was clear by the quarter pole, then drew off to prove much the
best, driving. ELEVENMONTHSLATER set the pace on the inside and was headed leaving the three eighths marker, then chased the winner off the turn
and proved no match for that rival while staying on to be clearly second best. BRIEF was well placed early on the inside, then shifted out and was three wide
on the far turn and weakened, bested rest. LET'S GO MO was off slowly, settled back early, came five wide off the turn and improved position. MAKE A
SPLASH was settled early on the inside an d tired. MOON POOL was settled three wide and tired.

COULD BE A COUGAR prompted the early pace from the outside, made a four wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole, then had a
long drive and edged clear late to prove best. ASHLEE'S RING pressed the early pace from between rivals, made a two wide bid on the turn and dueled
with the winner to the inside, then fought on to the wire but was out-kicked late. CHARM ALARM was settled early, three wide on the turn, angled in leaving
the three sixteenths and finished well on the inside to gain the show award. BUSTIN DOWN DOORS set a pressured pace on the inside, then fell off the
pace on the turn, swung out three wide leaving the turn and ran on despite losing the show award late. GIRVINIZED chased the pace on the inside and
swung out four wide leaving the turn but had no kick. SIMPLE SOUVENIR was reserved early, advanced four wide on the turn, came six wide off the turn
and had a mild late rally but needed more. MUSKOKA SUMMER chased the pace four wide and came five wide off the turn and had no rally. CUT FROM
CLASS was settled on the inside and had no response.

UNCLE DAR was bumped at the start, then vied for the early lead three wide, then made a bid and drew clear on the turn, then remained clear to the wire to
prove best under right handed crop urging. MAJOR THOMAS tracked the early pace from between rivals, then remained between rivals on the turn and
three wide off the turn and finished willingly to be clearly second best. LILTONYTWOPHONES was reluctant to load, lunged at the start, then moved to the
inside and advanced, then was two wide by the quarter pole and swung out and finished well to best the rest. YO NESSROUNDONKERN stalked the early
pace on the outside, four wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. CAPITAL CONQUEST was bumped hard at the start, reserved early and was on the
inside on the turn and had a belated rally on the inside. ZAMBONI WARRIOR chased the pace three wide and had no rally. DIXIE CANNONBALL broke in

BACK FORTY was well placed on the inside, waited for racing room by the quarter pole, then made a inside bid leaving the turn and went on even terms by
the furlong marker and then kicked clear to prove best under a drive. SISTER COUSIN set the pace on the inside and then was two wide off the turn and
confronted by the furlong marker and could not match strides with the winner late while staying on for the place award. PHABULOUS PHOEBE was settled
early on the outside, steadied leaving the seven sixteenths, then shifted in on the turn and was on the inside leaving the turn and advancing, then angled out
leaving the furlong marker and finished well, bested rest. LADY AHAVA was settled early and made a four wide advance on the turn, came five wide off the
turn but flattened out late. VELVET VIXEN stalked the pace from between rivals and weakened in the drive. NEISSA stalked the early pace on the outside,
made a three wide bid by the quarter pole but came up empty in the drive. SOPHIA'S ROSE chased the early pace on the inside and weakened.

margin under a hand ride with plenty of speed to spare. SPEAK OF THE DEVIL stalked th early pace three wide, two wide on the turn and proved to be no
match for the winner while clearly second best. THE GREAT CASBY was reserved early, advanced three wide on the far turn and then bested the rest while
no threat to the top two. TEXTPECTATION was bumped at the start, settled back early, advanced five wide on the far turn and came six wide off the turn
and passed the tiring rivals. DEVOTED KITTEN was reserved early, made a mild four wide middle move and tired. CONTINENTAL DIVIDE chased the pace

Footnotes
BRIGHT PATH stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to press the pace and then dueled for the lead off the turn and then drew off in
the final furlong to prove best under a drive. WARRIOR AT BAT vied for the lead two wide, then went on to set a pressured pace on the inside on the turn,
then dueled with the winner off the turn but was no match for that rival in the final furlong while clearly second best. COXZY tracked the early pace and
made a four wide bid on the far turn but came up empty in the drive, held show award. IN THE AIR was off slowly, then advanced on the inside on the far
turn and passed the tiring rivals. LUCCA'S LEGACY broke outwardly at the start bumping a rival, then rushed up the inside to vie for command early, then
dropped back on the turn and came three wide into the lane and drifted out in the lane while tiring. BIG SMILE chased the pace and was four wide on the
turn and weakened. PUTT was outrun early, wide on the turn and was not a factor. RIGATONI ALA VODKA was bumped a the start and was not a threat.
