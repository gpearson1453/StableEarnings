DOCTORED DEAL vied for the lead two wide, forged a narrow advantage nearing the lane, continued to spar with his inner counterpart through the final
furlong and maintained a margin. LIKE THIS vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, fought on while headed through the lane but was denied
re-achieving even terms. GEORGE ALLEN tracked the top pair from the two path, tipped outside of them turning for home, but only managed to chase
thereafter and held show. COPTER bounced off of rivals on either side multiple times at the start, stalked outside of the top pair, chased them from the five
path around the turn, gave way entering the lane yet lasted for fourth. KAJUN KARMA broke a step slow, trailed along the inside, swung out to the seven
path in upper stretch and moved up. RANCH BADGE saved ground well back, then improved between horses. HARDLY ABLE bumped with an outer rival
multiple times at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside and gave way. MACHO BEANIE brushed the outer part of the gate while being floated
outwardly by an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace hung in the five to six path and failed to menace. STAR REDEMPTION broke outwardly, lacked
speed in the two to four path and tired. CHARCO bumped with an inner rival multiple times at the start, chased from midpack two wide, then faded between
horses.

Footnotes
POINT PROVEN trailed early on, advanced in the three path around the far turn, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to bid at the furlong
grounds and drove clear. FREEDOM'S WAY stalked in the four to three path, bid along with an outer rival around the far turn, led narrowly in upper stretch,
but was headed by his outer counterpart and a wider bidder leaving the furlong grounds, yet fought back to reclaim place late. THE REDS snagged the
outer part of the starting gate while off awkwardly, settled off of the pace in the three to four path and between horses, moved forward to press outside of the
top pair entering the far turn, sustained a bid while hanging on his left lead to vie in midstretch as an outer bidder menaced, got outkicked by that one while
forging place in the final furlong, but hung late and relinquished place. AGENT CREED saved ground tracking behind the leaders, shifted out to the five path
while getting outkicked by a wider bidder in upper stretch and chased the leaders home. BIG DREAMING stuttered a step upon leaving the gates, then
failed to menace from the five path. SWING SHIFT showed the way in the two path before chasing an outer rival approaching the backstretch, yielded
between horses with nine sixteenths to go and faded around the far turn. CREW DRAGON moved forward to lead in the three to two path around the first
turn, met a pair of outer challenges around the far turn, got headed in upper stretch and weakened.

TUSCAN SKY stalked outside of the pace setter, was roused to offer a bid passing the half mile pole, sparred two wide around the far turn, forged a narrow
advantage in upper stretch, clung to that margin through midstretch and inched away in the final sixteenth. NASH showed the way around the first turn, was
confronted by an outer bidder with a half mile to go, dueled with that one around the far turn, fought on after being headed in upper stretch, but failed to
regain even terms before yielding late. HAWKS CREEK was no match for the top pair and got outrun.

Footnotes
BENJI STAR tracked in the four to five path around the turn, bid in upper stretch and drove clear. ALVARADO CAT pressed in the four path, got outkicked
by an outer rival in upper stretch, kept on to edge place from the early pace-setter in the closing stages and held from an outer bidder. CAUSEWAY BENNY
raced off of the pace in the four path, fanned out to the seven path entering the lane, ran on while widest to reach show and miss place at the wire. HE'S
JUST LUCKY set the pace in the two to three path, got headed while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, yielded in the final sixteenth and lost minor
placings late. WISH CAREFULLY pursued from midpack in the three to five path, chased while sustaining stride through the lane, but encountered mild
traffic at the sixteenth pole and lacked a bid. SAINT GABRIEL chased from midpack along the inside, then two wide entering the lane and ran on willingly to
miss in the photo for minor placings. LEROUX broke slow, lacked speed in the two path, shifted to the five to six path in upper stretch and moved up.
HENNESSY WILD broke slowly and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, then failed to factor from the three to four path. ACHROMEDOUTCAT
prompted the pace in the three path and between the top pair into the turn, but weakened turning for home. NOPENOTTONIGHT bumped an inner rival at
the start, chased along the inside and weakened. VEGA STAR broke a step slow, lagged behind around the turn and showed little. KEV MAN lacked speed
while hung in the five path and tired.

Footnotes
OUR PRETTY WOMAN showed the way in the two path, felt pressure from an outer rival turning for home, shook free of that one entering the lane in the
three path and drew clear. STANDOUTSENSATION laid off of the pace along the inside, moved to the three path entering the lane and ran on to edge place
from outer foes in the final furlong. MS QUALITY CONTROL leaned in at the start, pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, chased in
the three to five path aiming outside of the leaders around the far turn, advanced to gain place in upper stretch, but leveled off and was bested by an inner
bidder in the final furlong. LIUZZA was brushed between horses at the start, stalked outside of the leader and from the three path, pressed turning for home,
but was turned away entering the lane in the four path and yielded between horses. NORISKIT NOBISCUIT trailed in the two path early on and failed to
factor. SPLASH MASTER tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. CORA'S LEGACY broke outwardly, tracked in the four path and
outside of foes but was done early.

Footnotes
HARBOR SPRINGS tracked from midpack in the three to four path, bid in the five path and outside of the leading trio entering upper stretch, drove clear
nearing the furlong grounds and widened. PLUM TRICKY prompted two wide, vied between horses around the turn, led narrowly entering the lane in the
three path, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and held place. ELECTRIFYING MOJO bumped an outer rival at the start, chased close up
along the inside into the turn, moved from the three path to the six path in upper stretch and ran on to gain show late. BEELIEVE HER showed the way early
on, vied with an outer pair of bidders around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and lost show late. GOURMET pressed three wide, vied around the turn,
but floated to the four path entering the lane and yielded between horses shortly after. STYLISH SUE lacked speed two wide and between horses, shifted
out to the five path in upper stretch and moved up. QUALITY CREDIT hopped at start and was last away, laid off of the pace three wide and made little
impact. TORREY STREET leaned in slightly before being bumped by an inner rival leaving the gates, saved ground of off the pace, but failed to factor while
hanging on her left lead. I AM BEAUTIFUL trailed along the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
DRIP set the pace in the two path, inched clear entering the lane and held firm while hanging on his left lead. DISCREET MISCHIEF bumped with an inner
rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path, sustained a rail chase while slowly progressing, vied for place with an outer rival in the final sixteenth
and narrowly prevailed. BANNED FOR LIFE stalked along the inside, tipped to take aim on the clearing leader from the three path entering upper stretch,
but was sternly kept at bay through midstretch, chased while vying for place with an inner bidder in the late stages and was bested for that position.
GRANTHOR prompted outside of the leader while under consistent urging, failed to sustain pressure and chased form the four path around the turn, then
hung on his left lead through the lane and lacked a bid. PRACTICAL THOUGHT lacked speed along the inside, then ran on but failed to menace.
DEVILSGOTACAUSE laid off of the pace in the six to five path into the turn, then surpassed tired rivals. HIGGINS BOAT tracked in the five path, tucked to
the three path coming under urging nearing the three furlong pole and tired. MISTER LINCOLN leaned in and bushed a rival at the start, raced forwardly
among foes, advanced to press the leader from the three path into the turn, sustained pressure turning for home, but weakened between horses entering
the lane. COURAGEOUS CUPID was off slow and brushed by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the four path and made little impact. DIAMOND LORD
bumped with an outer rival at the start, pursued from off of the pace two wide and gave way.

Footnotes
MINNESOTA READY tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, unleashed a good kick in upper stretch and blew past the clear
leader entering the final sixteenth. JUST MIGHT set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied mild pressure around the turn, inched clear in upper
stretch, but was overhauled by an outer bidder at the sixteenth pole. PIRATE RICK pressed the leader from the three path, but failed to keep pace with that
one in upper stretch, got outkicked for place in midstretch and remained clear of the rest. WENT WEST laid off of the pace in the four to six path, then ran
on mildly to reach fourth at the wire. SILENT POET chased from the two path around the turn, drifted inwardly in upper stretch and gave way. READY TO
POUNCE saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. MISCHIEVOUS ROGUE leaned out and broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the five to seven path
and made little impact.

Footnotes
ANTIQUARIAN prompted two wide, vied around the far turn, drew clear while shifting out nearing the furlong grounds and held sway. CORNISHMAN
bumped an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the four path, gained eye-catchingly four wide around the far turn, floated to the five path entering
the lane, sustained his rally to edge place in the late stages but needed more to reel in the clear leader. EL MAGNIFICO stalked three wide, entered the
lane in the four path, pursued the clearing leader along with an outer rival into the final furlong, then lost place in the final sixteenth. ELKO COUNTY was
squeezed by rivals on either side and steadied back at the start, trailed early on, took the far turn in the four path before swinging to the seven path into
upper stretch and moved up. JUSTIFREAK set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure, dueled with that bidder around the far turn, but gave way
entering midstretch. FUNNYFLAME tracked along the inside, chased around the far turn and lacked a bid. SWEETALKINGBOURBON bumped an outer
rival at the start, pursued from midpack four wide, came under a drive chasing in the three path around the far turn, then tired. SABI lacked speed two wide,
pursued between horses around the far turn and made little impact. DJANGO was bumped by the inner stall door when it rebounded back into him at the
start, bobbled in the aftermath, lacked speed along the inside, took closer order in the early stages of the backstretch, but tired turning for home.

SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked with run behind foes around the far turn, cut the corner and offered a rail bid in
upper stretch, drew clear approaching midstretch and held late. TRYINMYHEARTOUT settled well back in the two path, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, altered course a bit wider at the three sixteenths pole, rallied among foes into the final furlong, progressed to take aim on the leader late but needed
more to reel her in. WATCH THIS BIRDIE rated off of the pace along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, swung out to the seven path
entering the lane, rallied to gain show at the sixteenth pole and held from an outer bidder. CREATIVE CAIRO trailed in the three path, swung to the nine
path entering the lane before drifting wider in upper stretch, yet ran to miss reaching show. JOIN THE DANCE tracked along the inside, bid inside of the
leaders with three furlongs to go, led in the three path at the quarter pole, but drifted out while getting headed by a rail bidder in upper stretch and yielded.
NOT SO CLOSE showed the way remaining multiple paths off of the inner railing, vied between horses around the far turn after an inner rival offered a bid,
got headed by that one entering the lane in the four path and faded between horses. GIRL NAMED CHARLIE pressed in the four path, but floated to the five
path entering the lane and gave way between horses. LADYWEARSTHERING pursued from midpack in the three path, shifted to the six path entering the
lane, but lacked a rally while hanging on her left lead. SULTRY LASS stuttered a step at the start, raced off of the pace in the four path and made little
impact. FANCY MARTINI tracked two wide then tired through the lane. SWOONATRA prompted the pace in the six path and weakened turning for home.

MONEY SUPPLY settled off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride creeping closer to the leading trio in the two path around the far turn, swung to the
five path entering the lane to offer a bid in upper stretch, forged a narrow advantage at the furlong grounds, sparred through the late stages as his inner
counterpart persisted and clung to his advantage to the wire. BEST ACTOR set the pace along the inside, felt firm pressure from an outer pair entering the
backstretch causing a fast opening half mile, maintained an advantage from those rivals around the far turn, shook free in upper stretch, but was headed by
an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, battled on gamely to sustain a duel with that one through the late stages, but missed in a tight photo. GASOLINE
prompted the pace two wide and between horses through a fast pace, sustained pressure around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the leader in
upper stretch, got outkicked for place in upper stretch, dug in to resist a challenge for show entering the final sixteenth and held. RED ROUTE ONE lacked
speed along the inside, moved off of the fence entering the backstretch, came under urging in the two path around the far turn, shifted out to the six path in
upper stretch, ran on to bid for show at the sixteenth pole but was kept at bay. SMILE HAPPY fidgeted just before the gates sprung, hesitated slightly and
came out a step slow, pursued from midpack in the four path, chased under urging around the far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and failed to
menace. HAYES STRIKE raced towards the rear along the inside and made little impact. HAPPY AMERICAN raced at the rear in the two to three path,
failed to circle rivals in the five path around the far turn, floated to the seven path entering the lane and lacked a rally. DUBYUHNELL was hard used to
press three wide and force a hot pace, sustained pressure around the far turn but weakened between horses leaving the quarter pole and was eased
through the final furlong.

Footnotes
BEATBOX pursued from midpack along the inside, tracked while saving ground around the far turn, inched forward to bid inside of the leader in upper
stretch, sparred with a pair of outer rivals through the final furlong and prevailed. STRONG QUALITY set an unpressured lead in the two path, showed the
way into the lane as rivals on either side took aim, dug in to resist those rival's bids in upper stretch, sparred gamely between them through the final furlong
but missed. JOHNY'S FIREBALL tracked along the inside, then a bit off the inner railing approaching and around the far turn, tipped to take aim from the
three path entering the lane, offered a bid nearing midstretch, dueled with an inner pair through the final furlong but was denied. GIGANTE pursued from
midpack in the three to four path, swung five wide entering the lane, but lugged inwardly while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch and only managed to
chase in the final furlong. CHASING THE CROWN saved ground well back, moved up inside of rivals entering the lane, then chased the leaders home.
HARLAN ESTATE laid off of the pace in the three to five paths and failed to menace. RISING EMPIRE stalked the leader from the three path, but weakened
four wide and between horses entering the lane. ENGLISH TAVERN tracked in the four to three path entering the backstretch, but chased around the far
turn and faded. DUKE OF CARTHANIA lacked speed three to two wide, then between horses around the far turn and made little impact. CAMP HOPE
settled of of the pace in the two path, then faded in the four path around the far turn. PALAZZI trailed along the inside, moved between horses entering
upper stretch, but was pinched between foes and steadied hard inside the three sixteenths pole, then failed to recover.

Footnotes
TARIFA tracked along the inside, pursued just off the inner rail around the far turn, tipped to the five path to take aim outside of the leading pair entering the
lane, progressed to bid while hanging on her left lead in upper stretch, led into the final furlong, kicked clear before changing over entering the final sixteenth
and held sway. INTRICATE settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted out around the far turn before swinging to the six path entering the lane, ran on in
pursuit of the clearing leader in the final furlong, flopped back to her left lead while forging place entering the final sixteenth and was second best. PERFECT
SHOT showed the way inside of a pressing rival while remaining a path off of the inside, vied with that one around the far turn, dug in to resist a wider
challenge in upper stretch, but was bested nearing the furlong grounds and gave way. ALPINE PRINCESS pressed the leader from the three path, vied
around the far turn, sustained the battle in the four path and between horses in upper stretch but yielded entering the final furlong. V V'S DREAM bobbled
very subtly at the start, tracked in the three path, but faded between horses after being floated to the five path entering the lane. PENNICK hopped when the
gates sprung and lost her balance upon landing, raced at the rear in the two to four path leaving the first turn, then tired around the far turn and was eased
up through the late stages.

Footnotes
SIERRA LEONE brushed with an outer rival early on, settled off of the pace in the two to three paths, fanned to the nine to ten path entering the lane, rallied
widest of all in midstretch, gained place while shifting inwardly passing the sixteenth pole and sustained progress to drive past the leader in the shadow of
the wire. TRACK PHANTOM showed the way in the two path, shifted out to the five path entering the lane to deter outer bidders, drove clear in upper
stretch, maintained a margin into the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer on-charging bidder in the closing stages. CATCHING FREEDOM pursued
from midpack three wide, then four wide and between horses around the far turn before fanning to the eight path entering the lane, sustained a grinding
charge while hanging on his left lead, but was outkicked for place while put to tight quarters at the sixteenth pole. RESILIENCE stalked outside of the leader
entering the backstretch, moved to press as an outer rival forced his hand into the far turn, but was floated to the six path by the leader entering the lane,
chased along with outer rivals in the final furlong, but yielded with a sixteenth to go. HONOR MARIE lacked speed well back along the inside, shifted to the
five path entering the lane, picked up stride shifting wider in midstretch and ran on. AWESOME RUTA pursued from midpack two wide and between horses,
chased around the far turn and lacked a bid. HALL OF FAME tracked along the inside, steadied subtly while well handled getting a bit keyed up entering the
backstretch, settled into stride before pursuing between horses with five furlongs to, moved forward to press outside of the top pair and from the four path at
the three furlong pole, but failed to sustain pressure getting floated to the seven path entering the lane and gave way. REAL MEN VIOLIN laid off of the
pace along the inside, got shuffled back behind a fading rival turning for home, slipped through along the rail in upper stretch but lacked a bid. MOONLIGHT
steadied when put to a bit of crowded quarters among foes early on, settled well back in the two to four path, fanned to the ten path entering the lane and
failed to factor. TIZZY INDY trailed along the inside and never got involved. CARDINALE stalked along the inside, chased into the far turn and faded turning
for home. BEE DANCER broke a bit outwardly, tracked from the three to four path around the first turn, but chased in the five path around the far turn and
weakened getting floated wider nearing the lane.
