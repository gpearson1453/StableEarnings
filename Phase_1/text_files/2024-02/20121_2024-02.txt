MY ANCHOR IS HOT , three deep on the turn, chased the pace, rallied inside ROCKSIE HARBRAKER and led late. ROCKSIE HARTBRAKER bore in
leaving the starting gate, quickly opened up, set the pace off the rail, drifted out near the sixteenth pole and weakened. CANDIED JOULE lacked speed,
circled the turn three wide, angled out in mid stretch and rallied nicely. STORM CENT bobbled leaving the starting gate, raced three wide on the turn and
lacked the needed rally. HARBOR'S BEAUTY raced along the inner rail throughout and was no factor. SNOOZY SUZY stumbled when pinched back soon
after the break, saved ground on the turn and failed to rally.

Footnotes
EL CAPRICHO broke alertly to make the lead, set the pace along the inner rail and prevailed with something in reserve. TIGER HUNTER saved ground
around both turns, chased the winner throughout, eased out in mid stretch and finished willingly. WESTERBERG , three wide both turns, flattened out.
PHILBIN ROAD , shuffled back soon after the break, chased the pace in the two path and weakened through the stretch. SHADYFIED , three wide the first
turn, chased the pace outside horses down the backstretch and weakened after a half mile. PAINTED SMOKE was outrun.

Footnotes
LETTHERAINSETTLEIT , four wide the first turn, advanced four deep around the far turn, secured command in upper stretch and edged clear. LITTLE
CASINO set the pace near the inner rail, was hooked turning for home and gave way grudgingly. DUAL THREAT , steadied in tight quarters entering the
first turn, was four wide the far turn and lacked the necessary rally. VANTAGE POINT bore out entering the first turn, steadied in close quarters entering the
far turn, swung to the five path approaching the stretch and finished well. FAR WEST , three wide the first turn, prompted the pace down the backstretch,
moved to the inner rail leaving the far turn and weakened. IL CAPITANO , reluctant to load into the starting gate, lunged at the break, was four deep the first
turn and dropped back.

Footnotes
CAN'T WANT THAT stalked the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, was three deep on the turn, responded in the stretch, rallied outside foes and
was up late. MUSICAL DIVA dueled inside MY QUIET PLACE, saved ground around the turn, dug in tenaciously through the stretch but drifted out
approaching the wire placing MY QUIET PLACE in tight quarters inside the winner. ROCKY BAY RAE lacked speed, swung outside leaving the backstretch,
was well wide turning for home and closed strongly outside rivals. MY QUIET PLACE disputed the pace outside MUSICAL DIVA throughout and was
steadied when that one herded her out, placing her in tight quarters approaching the finish. ETHAN'S GIRL , a forward factor along the inner rail, chased the
pace and weakened. ZACANGO PRIDE raced along the inner rail around the turn and was not a factor. PRAIRIE MOON , three wide on the turn, was
outrun. Following a stewards' inquiry, MUSICAL DIVA was disqualified and placed fourth for impeding MY QUIET PLACE.

Footnotes
DAHLIA'S DANCER , well off the rail chasing the pace around the turn, floated out a bit in upper stretch, closed determinedly outside CHOCOLATE
FRECKLES, led late and drove clear. CHOCOLATE FRECKLES broke sharply and quickly went clear, set the pace near the inner rail around the turn,
remained in front in mid stretch, drifted out and finished willingly. BIG BELL saved ground on the turn, drifted out in mid stretch and rallied mildly. A
THOUSAND DREAMS angled to the four path in upper stretch, moved inside horses near the sixteenth pole and finished willingly. MISS JOANNIE , four
deep on the turn, chased the pace to upper stretch and weakened. ROSES FOR SUZZETT , outrun, raced along the inner rail.
