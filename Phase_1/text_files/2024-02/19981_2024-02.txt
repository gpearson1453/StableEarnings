Footnotes
BOBBY'S GIFT set a well rated, well measured pace while on a clear lead to the far turn, shook off the challenge of rival at the quarter pole to re-open a
clear margin in upper stretch and repelled the late closer at the wire in a well handled ride. FRANCO stalked the pace from the fence through the far turn,
tipped out for the run down the lane and closed well only to be denied in deep stretch. FUEGO CALIENTE prompted the pace down the backside, rallied to
engage the winner at the quarter pole, could not go with that one and was out-finished inside the eighth pole. LUCKY JUNIOR broke slowly to give the field
several lengths from the gate, ranged up while racing wide in the first turn, tracked the leaders down the backstretch and finished evenly.
YOUVESAIDITALL trailed most of the way failing to threaten. SECRET LIFE STYLE showed brief speed to contend early and gave way into the final bend.

Footnotes
PRANCIPANTS settled in hand along the rail through the first turn, worked to the outside down the backstretch, rallied four wide circling the pacesetters to
be prominent at the head of the lane, engaged the leaders in mid-stretch and pulled clear to the wire. ALICIA'S WAY prompted the pace to the far turn,
rallied two wide to take the lead turning for home, responded when challenged in upper stretch and was outkicked down the lane. MAMBO KITTEN
unhurried for the first half mile to be at the rear of the field, rallied on the bend making a steady advance, angled wide to make a belated bid in the lane.
CATALENA tracked the leaders to be prominent in upper stretch and failed to mount a late rally. DONNARUMMA stalked the pace from the rail to be well
placed and weakened coming home. ANIPPE set the pace to the quarter pole and tired through the stretch. POLYESTER BRIDE contended to the
three-eighths pole and failed to respond when called upon.

Footnotes
ROSY APPLE tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied three wide to engage the lleader turning for home, wore that rival down inside the eighth pole and
held the closer off determinedly. INDY PRINCESS KOKO reserved off the pace early, circled four wide at the head of the lane and closed well only to be
denied late in the drive. REMEMBEROLDTYMES stalked the pace into the turn, rallied on the bend to take the lead before the quarter pole, dug-in gamely
when challenged down the lane and was outkicked inside the sixteenth pole. BLACK BUTTE unhurried early to be near the back of the pack and made a
steady grinding advance to hit the board. DESIGNATE slow early to trail and passed weakened rivals in the lane. LA REINA DEL NORTE showed early
speed to press the pace and faded. SWEET EMPIRE was never a threat. FLYING BUSINESS rushed up along the fence to set the early pace and tired
coming home.

Footnotes
RED GUN tracked the leaders from the rail while waiting for racing room, saved the ground while turning for home ,surged through the hole at the top of the
lane and cleared off late. SCRATCHOFF pressed the pace from two wide to the quarter pole, took a momentary lead turning for home, could not go with the
winner but finished willingly to be second best. FROSTY PAWS tracked the leaders into the turn, rallied four wide to engage the pacesetters and loom boldly
turning for home and was out-finished down the lane. ESTILO CLASICO set the pressured pace to the top of the stretch and weakened down the lane.
SILVER MATT broke slowly to be at the rear of the filed, showed late interest in the stretch run while drifting out down the lane. FORTY STRIPES went
evenly failing to threaten. TOYI prominently placed through the turn and faded coming for home. THE EQUINEST failed to menace while crowded down in
the stretch run while finishing evenly. THE RIDER OF THE EQUINEST CLAIMED FOUL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN, UPON REVIEW
THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
NOSEY POWER reserved in mid-pack through the turn, rallied splitting rivals turning for home and prevailed in a long drive. HARSH TRUTH slow early to
trail the field, rallied from six wide at the head of the lane, altered course angling in for the stretch run and closed well belatedly to be gaining late. NOAH MY
BABY sped to lead after breaking sharply, opened a wide advantage on the turn and tired inside the eighth pole. TAMMY'S TOY chased the pacesetter tho
upper stretch and lacked a finishing kick. HAPPY TAKEOVER passed tiring rivals in the lane. SLICK EDDIE stalked the pace from the fence through the
turn and faded in the lane. PLAYING BALL was never a factor.

PRESSLEY RIDGE prompted the early pace through the first turn, took command down the backside, opened a well measured lead and repelled all
challenges late in the drive. LIVING THE DREAM stalked the leaders through the far turn, mounted a looming bid in upper stretch and failed to get passed
the winner through the lane. INDY CARR took the lead through the first turn, settled to be just off the leader down the backside, lost ground on the turn and
came on again late in the drive. ONE STEP ASIDE failed to menace. BIG TIME FLIRT was never a threat. SWEET JILL'S JACK was not a factor.

SWEET UNIQUE sped to the lead while well rated, responded when challenged nearing the quarter pole to open a clear advantage and drew off through
the lane. BODIL pressed the pace into the turn, rallied to challenge turning for home, was no match for the winner but dug-in willingly down the stretch to
hold the place. LARRY'S ANGEL stalked the pace to uper stretch and closed well to just miss the place. DELIGHTFUL CAT well placed chasing the leaders
to be in striking distance at the head of the lane and failed to mount a closing rally. SEEYOUINMOTOWN raced at the rear of the field to midway on the turn
and passed weaker rivals coming home. YOU NAME IT was not a factor. SPICE ICE raced in contention for a half mile and faded in the lane.

GOODNESS SAKES stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to take the lead at the quarter pole and pulled clear down the lane. KAT TRAX
unhurried early to trail, commenced a steady advance under an early drive and kept grinding in the stretch. TWISTED JUSTICE showed speed to take the
lead shortly from the gate, set the pace to the quarter pole, responded when challenged but weakened in mid-stretch. ONE RICH KITTEN went evenly while
failing to threaten. MOBIL MEMORY pressed the pace to the turn from the rail, droped out on the turn and kept on in the stretch.
