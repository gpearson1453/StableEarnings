Footnotes
DRIVE BY broke alertly, ceded the early lead to SIX HOT GRANDS and pressed that rival into the turn, took a narrow lead approaching the quarter marker,
kicked clear into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and pulled away in the late stages. GALLOPING MAJOR broke in a bit at the start and
was off a step slowly, tracked the early pace from the inside, ran in pursuit into upper stretch, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in
deep stretch and outfinished MENDONSA to secure place honors. MENDONSA tracked the early pace from between rivals, improved position two to three
wide along the turn, lost ground approaching the furlong marker, finished evenly into the final sixteenth, battled with GALLOPING MAJOR for place honors
into deep stretch and was outfinished for second while clear of the rest for third. WE CAN tracked the early pace from the outside, made a mild advance
three to four wide at the quarter marker, came widest into the stretch, chased to the furlong marker and did not offer a late rally. SIX HOT GRANDS was
sent to establish the early lead, set a pressured pace into the turn and carved out moderate fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by the winner
into upper stretch, chased DRIVE BY to the furlong marker and gave way. AKBAR tracked the decent early pace while between runners, maintained a two
wide path into the turn and lost ground heading to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DORINE'S WILD CAT was allowed to settle in the early stages, maintained a ground saving position into the far turn, angled three to four wide nearing the
top of the stretch, was roused for the drive and vied for the lead approaching the furlong marker, battled with CHURCH HARBOR to the sixteenth pole,
shook free of the runner-up into deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. CHURCH HARBOR showed good early speed and vied for the lead away from
the start, ceded the lead to MISSING PENNY and stalked that runner through moderate fractions along the backstretch run, went up to pressured MISSING
PENNY along the second turn and assumed command into the stretch, felt pressure nearing the furlong marker from DORINE'S WILD CAT, battled with the
winner to the sixteenth pole, was outkicked in deep stretch and just held for place honors. VILLA NOVA took back off of the early pace, was well placed into
the backstretch run and advanced while saving ground at the half-mile marker, was roused into the second turn then waited a bit for racing room nearing the
top of the stretch, gained ground into the stretch and came within aim at the furlong marker, raced a bit in tight through the final furlong and missed for
second, while clear of the rest for third. SWEET LAYLA RAE tracked the early pace from the second flight, was well positioned along the backstretch run
and gained ground between runners at the half-mile marker, chased two to three wide into upper stretch, rallied and came within range at the furlong pole,
could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and weakened. TIGERIZE was allowed to settle, maintained a two wide path along the first turn, tracked the
moderate pace two wide to the half-mile pole, lost ground two to three wide along the far turn and did not threaten in the stretch. MISSING PENNY vied for
the early lead with CHURCH HARBOR then assumed command along the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted through the backstretch run,
showed the way into the far turn, came under pressure at the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch and gave way.

stretch and rallied to vie for the lead at the furlong marker, took command and kicked clear at the sixteenth pole, was hand urged in deep stretch and drew
off in the final stages to be much the best. UPSTART YANKEE rated off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace
through the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile pole, made a steady advance while saving ground into the stretch, was no match for the
winner in the final sixteenth and nailed his stablemate at the finish to secure the place. TRAVEL THE MAP broke alertly and was sent to establish the early
lead, set solid fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, showed the way into the far turn and led into upper stretch, was confronted by
THREEBROTHERS nearing the furlong marker, lost the lead to that rival and chased into the final sixteenth, weakened in deep stretch, was nailed on the
wire for place honors and held clearly for show. TALISKER BAY allowed to settle in the early running, was caught a bit wide into the first turn and raced four
wide into the backstretch run, was unhurried to the half-mile marker and was guided five wide into the far turn, improved position at the quarter marker, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth. MOVIETIME lunged at the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle and saved ground
into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and maintained an inside path into the far turn, rallied into the stretch then came in tight at the
furlong marker, found room into the final sixteenth and lacked a final response. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) close up to the early pace, prompted TRAVEL

Footnotes
ALMOST SNOW was away in good order and vied for the lead away from the start, took back and tracked the pace into the turn, raced close up to the
moderate pace while three wide at the quarter marker, was given his cue into upper stretch and battled for the lead at the furlong marker, took a narrow
advantage at mid-stretch, kicked clear into the final sixteenth and drew away in the late stages. MY BUCKET LIST broke slowly and was allowed to settle
early on, was steered to the outside entering the turn and chased four to five wide to the quarter marker, raced widest into the stretch and rallied at the
furlong marker, could not impact the winner in the final sixteenth and outfinished the rest to be second best. MR. FIGHTER was away slowly and was
unhurried to begin, saved ground into the turn, tipped two wide for the drive and improved position at the furlong marker, closed into the final sixteenth and
was up in the final strides to secure third. CARDINAL TRICK chased the moderate pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three wide to the quarter marker,
raced evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster a final response and was tagged for third in the final strides. GOOD FOCUS prominent leaving the start, took
back and tracked from the inside heading into the turn, improved position into the bend then came in tight while between runners at the quarter pole, found
room into the stretch and rallied two wide at the furlong grounds, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out. TIGER ATTACK was
hustled to show speed and assumed command in the early going, set a decent pace heading into the turn while off of the rail, came under pressure at the
quarter marker and met the bid of ALMOST SNOW into upper stretch, battled with the winner to the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth
and weakened in deep stretch. HAVAKASH READY hard to load prior to the start, was forwardly placed in the early running and stalked the decent pace
from the inside, was well placed into the turn then came under a hold while in a bit tight at the quarter marker, chased into the stretch, lacked a response in
the final sixteenth and gave way.

Footnotes
KRISTIN LEE was away a step slowly leaving the start, rushed up and stalked the decent early pace from the inside, was well positioned into the turn and
vied for the lead at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch, kicked clear at the furlong marker and drew away under moderate urging in deep
stretch. TOUR QUEEN drifted out leaving the start but was away in good order, raced close up to the decent early pace and vied for the lead three wide at
the quarter marker, drifted out a path into upper stretch and was outkicked approaching the furlong pole, was able to mildly re-rally into the final sixteenth,
could not impact the winner in deep stretch and outfinished BROADWAY TIGER to secure place honors. BROADWAY TIGER broke alertly and assumed
command away from the start, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the half-mile marker, was confronted into the turn and vied for the lead
between rivals at the quarter pole, lost the lead to KRISTIN LEE into upper stretch and chased that runner to the furlong marker, weakened in the final
sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for third. SUPER ELLIE bobbled leaving the start and was off slowly, lacked
early speed and was guided outside of rivals entering the turn, went three wide along the bend and gained ground at the quarter marker, drifted to the five
path into upper stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, offered a mild rally in the final sixteenth but could not impact the leaders in deep stretch.
GREATFUL ATTITUDE lost her path at the start and was off slowly, chased the decent early pace and gained ground two wide into the turn, maintained a
two wide path into the stretch and ran evenly while in pursuit at the furlong marker, could not muster a late response and tired in the final sixteenth. LUSMA
veered in at the start, bothered a neighboring rival and was away slowly, void of early speed, was guided two to three wide into the turn and gained ground
at the quarter marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and did not factor in the late stages.

Footnotes
UNBRIDLED VISION away in good order, vied for the early lead with TIGER IN MY TANK and contested decent fractions with that rival heading into the
turn, pressed the pace two to three wide along the bend and vied for the lead at the quarter marker, drifted out into upper stretch and lost a bit of ground
approaching the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, raced on even terms with TIGER IN MY TANK into deep stretch, took a narrow lead in the
final strides and determinedly held on for the win. SPINNIN PISTOLS broke alertly and was prominent in the early running, took back and settled off of the
decent pace heading to the half-mile pole, saved ground into the turn then angled three wide nearing the top of the stretch, shifted widest for the drive and
improved position at the furlong marker, rallied into the final sixteenth, closed with a rush into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while just getting up
to secure place honors. TIGER IN MY TANK was sent leaving the break and assumed a narrow early lead, set a decent pace while pressed into the turn
and contested the lead with UNBRIDLED VISION heading to the quarter marker, battled with that rival into the stretch and held a narrow lead approaching
the furlong pole, was all out while holding a slim lead into the final sixteenth, gamely battled into deep stretch, was just edged for the win and place at the
finish and held for the show. MELANIE'S TIGER fractious prior to the start, was crowded leaving the break and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried in the
early stages and was guided two to three wide into the turn, improved position at the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and continued his gain at
the furlong marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and missed for show honors. BOURBON DANCER broke a step slowly leaving the start,
recovered and stalked the decent early pace, went two to three wide into the turn and ran evenly to mid-stretch while within range of the lead, encountered a
bit of traffic into the final sixteenth, was gaining in deep stretch but needed more in the late stages. HALO UNCLE stalked the decent early pace from the
inside, gave chase while saving ground along the turn, was outkicked into the stretch and faded in the final furlong.

Footnotes
SKY MAKER was not asked for speed from the break and was content to settle behind the field well off the pace, launched the bid with three furlongs to run,
accelerated on cue, came five wide into the stretch and finished strong under steady handling. J AND M EXPRESS showed good speed from the break but
was floated four wide into the first turn, ceded the lead to TOP ANTICIPATION (GB) while stalking under a hold through the early running, pulled even
passing the half-mile pole then dueled that rival to the stretch, gained a short lead approaching the furlong grounds then was unable to hold off the winner
but held second in a solid effort. GEA raced near the back of the field early, then made some steady progress towards the front on the run down the
backstretch and into the turn, responded when set down after passing the three furlong marker, had to wait a bit for running room as the field turned for
home, got a seam near the three-sixteenths pole, finished well to gain third while well clear of the next horse. SUPER CARO broke well and was able to
gain the rail position on the run through the first turn, saved all the ground to the far turn, then swung out four wide for the stretch run, finished willingly but
was not quite good enough. MOMMA MOCCA was allowed to settle into stride and was content to race mid-pack for the first half-mile while racing in the
three path, started a mild rally three wide on the far turn then finished one-paced down the stretch. RIVETING SPIRIT raced close up between horses early
on, was kept in a tracking position not far behind the leading pair, rode the rail thorough the far turn, began to struggle to keep up before the quarter pole
and came up empty for the stretch run. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) was sent hard for the lead, opened up a clear lead down the backstretch while setting
reasonable fractions, met a challenge from J AND M EXPRESS near the five-sixteenths pole battled to the stretch then began to before the furlong marker
and faded.
