Footnotes
CHAMAVILLE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and pressed her stablemate through moderate fractions heading into the turn, took a narrow lead while
between runners at the quarter marker, battled with PURPLE MOUNTAIN into the stretch, repelled the runner-up in the final sixteenth and edged away in
deep stretch to prove best. PURPLE MOUNTAIN was a bit rank in the early going, stalked the moderate pace from the outside and mounted a three wide
bid nearing the quarter marker, drew to even terms with CHAMAVILLE into upper stretch and battled to the furlong marker with that rival, was turned away
approaching the sixteenth-pole and held well in the final stages for second. KEEPYOURPRANCEON tracked the moderate early pace while not far back,
maintained a two wide path into the turn, came a bit in tight while behind horses nearing the quarter marker and swung four wide for the drive, chased the
leading pair to mid-stretch, closed well into the final sixteenth and just missed for place honors. SOCIAL STATUS chased the moderate early pace from the
outside, went two to three wide to the quarter marker and did not offer a late response. MISS WILL lacked early speed while a bit green, saved ground into
the turn, swung five wide for the drive and did not factor. HAPPY CHAPPY was hustled leaving the break, assumed command and set a pressured early
pace, was overtaken approaching the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LOADED MUSKET prominent leaving the start, took back into the first turn and stalked the early pace into the backstretch run, attended to the modest pace
heading to the half-mile marker, was roused two to three wide into the far turn and took command at the quarter pole, was set down in upper stretch and
battled with EFFECTIVE GIG to the furlong marker, shook free and drew to a clear lead past the furlong grounds, was kept to task while holding foes at bay
into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from LYING GHOST, dug in in the final strides and just lasted for the win at the finish. LYING GHOST settled just
off of the early pace while not far back, came in a bit tight nearing the half-mile pole and checked between rivals, recovered into the far turn then waited for
racing room two wide at the quarter marker, found room into upper stretch and advanced at the furlong pole, continued that bid and rallied into the final
sixteenth, pressured LOADED MUSKET into deep stretch and just missed for the win at the finish, while holding safely in the end for place honors.
EFFECTIVE GIG forwardly placed leaving the start, assumed command into the first turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, set a modest pace to
the half-mile marker, was overtaken nearing the quarter pole and battled LOADED MUSKET into the stretch, was repelled past the furlong marker, needed
more into deep stretch and just held for third at the wire. RICH GOLD was allowed to settle leaving the start, went outside of runners along the first turn and
raced three wide into the backstretch run, content to trail to the half-mile marker, mounted a four to five wide bid at the quarter marker and was outkicked
into the stretch, re-rallied into the final sixteenth but needed more in the late stages and just missed for third. LOOKOUT POINT unhurried in the early going,
saved ground into the backstretch run and settled while not far back heading to the half-mile pole, mounted an inside bid approaching the quarter marker,
could not sustain that run into the stretch and flattened out in the final furlong. WORKDAY tracked the modest early pace from the outside, was well
positioned along the backstretch run and tracked between runners into the second turn, came within aim three wide and between rivals at the quarter pole,
could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
MEEKING was hustled from the break and went clear early, set reasonable fractions while traveling well, held sway through the far turn, responded when
set down from the quarter pole and won clear under intermittent urging. GOODBYE KAI broke through the gate before the start, then broke outward at the
break and made light contact with LIFESBEENGOODTOME, tracked the pace from a few lengths back while staying out in the three path for clear run,
launched a bid at the leader from the three furlong pole, was unable to reel that one in but finished well clear of the next horse. TENNYSON WAY was
fractious in the gate before the start, broke inwards at the start and made some contact with LIFESBEENGOODTOME, raced well behind the pace near the
rear of the field to the far turn, ran on well down the stretch despite racing on the left lead for most of the run and was able to gain the third spot while no
threat to the top pair. MANY SILVER BELLS was fractious prior to the start, veered in after the break, raced mid-pack through the first half mile, stayed on
the rail while moving closer through the far turn, went three wide into that turn then was put under a drive after passing the three furlong pole, could not
match strides with the top two, flattened out in the stretch and was passed for third. LIFESBEENGOODTOME got pinballed at the start, taking light contact
from both sides after the break, dropped to last early and trailed well behind the field to the far turn, saved ground throughout, was kept to task and passed
one before the wire. HOT GOBLIN broke out at the start, recovered and followed MEEKING into the first turn, settled a couple of lengths behind and let that
one dictate the pace and was content with that position to the far turn, was put into a drive from the three furlong marker, did not go on and had nothing to
offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC GIG away in good order, was asked for speed leaving the start and assumed command of the early running, set a solid pace heading into the
turn and carved out decent fractions while just a bit off of the rail approaching the quarter marker, kicked clear into the stretch, was kept to task into the final
sixteenth and maintained a clear lead to the wire to hold sway. LILA AT THE BEACH tracked the solid early pace, stalked her stablemate through decent
fractions while two wide at the quarter pole, was outkicked into the stretch and chased the winner into the final sixteenth, could not make headway on
MAJESTIC GIG into deep stretch and just held for second at the finish. TIZ A TIGER was allowed to settle away from the start, improved position three to
four wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while just holding at the finish for
show honors. LITTLE LILIANA chased the solid early pace, came in tight and checked nearing the three-furlong marker, was guided to the inside and saved
ground to the quarter pole, was roused two wide into upper stretch, found her best stride late and just missed for the minor awards. DAWN AT LAST chased
the solid pace from the inside, saved ground to the quarter marker while close up, lacked the needed response at mid-stretch and gave way in the final
stages. RUNNING LUCK tracked the solid early pace from the outside, chased two to three wide to the quarter marker then shifted four wide for the drive,
was outrun to the furlong marker and lacked a response in the final sixteenth. AIR FORCE WOMAN was prominent away from the start and chased the solid
early pace, kept close attendance to the pacesetter while three wide nearing the quarter pole, dropped back into upper stretch and weakened in the final
furlong.

second turn and raced three to four wide to the quarter marker, circled the field and mounted a five wide bid into the stretch, rallied while widest inside of the
furlong marker, vied for the lead into the final sixteenth, surged in the final strides and was up in time for a determined win. ADAPTED MEMORY was sent
leaving the start and was forwardly placed in the early going, drifted out entering the first turn and carried out a rival at the seven-furlong marker, stalked the
pace three to four wide and between runners into the backstretch, took back off of the contentious pace and stalked to the half-mile pole, saved ground into

AUTISM PUZZLE was hustled from the gate, chased the two pacesetters early, advanced while getting a clean trip through the turn, had aim on
RAMATHORN turning for home, was kept to task and gradually wore down that foe despite racing on the wrong lead for the length of the stretch. ROCKET
RIBBON tracked the early pace from a few lengths back through the early stages, saved ground through the turn, launched a rally from the five-sixteenths
pole, slipped inside of RAMATHORN passing the furlong marker had the lead yards from the finish but was tagged at the wire. RAMATHORN broke well
and seized the lead early, was pressed by CLEAR THE COAST to the quarter pole, set fast fractions but was going well in hand, put that one away passing
the quarter pole, then opened up again when roused at the three-sixteenths pole then took on a pair of challengers inside and outside, held to deep stretch
then gave way grudgingly inside the final sixteenth. BOOK EM TAMO off a beat slow, raced mid-pack in the early going under some handling, saved ground
through the turn then was kept under steady handling down the stretch, made steady gains but found best stride a little too late. THIRSTY BABY outrun
early, kept to the inside through the turn, tipped out a path for the stretch run, ran on with some interest and was making mild gains in the late stages under
a brisk ride. HELEN'S SUN broke with the leaders then dropped back to a tracking position after about a furlong, tried to rally under pressure from the
quarter pole, did not quicken but finished even-paced to the finish. FACT OR FICTION was last away and bothered a bit by CLEAR THE COAST after the
break, dropped well behind early but was allowed to settle there, raced three to four wide through the turn, tried to launch a bid from the five-sixteenths,
came six wide into the stretch and could not improve. ZEN STATE was a little slow into stride, raced near the back of the pack through the early stages,
came under a ride from the seven-sixteenths pole, was unable to improve and chased the field to the wire. CLEAR THE COAST broke sharply, was pressed
to contest the early pace, chased RAMATHORN to the quarter pole then weakened and faded down the stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET LAYLA RAE was prominent in the early going, stalked the decent pace heading into the turn then advanced into the bend and pressed SAHARA
SUE to the quarter pole, drifted out in upper stretch and battled with SAHARA SUE approaching the furlong grounds, took command past mid-stretch and
drifted out nearing the sixteenth-marker, kept to task into deep stretch, felt late pressure from the runner-up and lasted in a drive to prevail. POINT AND
SHOOT was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the decent early pace and saved ground into the turn, was well placed at the quarter marker, tipped
two wide for the drive and lost ground at mid-stretch, re-rallied and closed fast into the final sixteenth, pressured the winner in deep stretch and just missed
for the win, while besting the rest. SAHARA SUE was hustled leaving the start, assumed early command and set a decent pace into the turn, was
confronted by SWEET LAYLA RAE into the bend and set the pace while pressed to the quarter pole, battled with SWEET LAYLA RAE into the stretch, could
not keep pace with the winner nearing the sixteenth-marker, yielded into deep stretch and held safely in the end for show honors. FRESNO CHILE rated off
of the decent early pace while not far back, went two wide into the turn and raced between rivals approaching the quarter marker, chased two wide into the
stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth but improved position in deep stretch. BLUE BREEZE was a allowed to
settle away from the start, raced outside of rivals into the turn and went four wide to the quarter marker, swung to the six path into upper stretch and offered
a mild late rally. TIGERIZE chased the decent pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three to four wide approaching the quarter marker, lost ground into the
stretch and did not factor in the final stages. LOCHMARA chased the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position at the quarter
marker, could not sustain that run into the stretch and did not threaten late. GENTLE JULIA broke alertly and vied for the lead away from the start, ceded the
early advantage to SAHARA SUE and stalked that rival through decent fractions heading into the turn, chased the pace two to three wide approaching the
quarter marker, was outrun into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong.
