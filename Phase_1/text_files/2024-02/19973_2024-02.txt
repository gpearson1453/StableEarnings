Footnotes
MISS JOANNIE broke a beat slow, recovered and was sent up to the inside of LOTSA LU to take over into the turn, spurted clear soon after, entered the
lane two wide, opened up past the three sixteenths then held sway under a solid hand ride. WORK N FLIRT , four wide early, shifted in around the turn to
pursue, came back out in upper stretch, straightened away and closed well. BONITA DIXIE , brushed at the break, gave three wide pursuit into the turn,
shifted out and circled five wide into the lane then offered a mild response to nab the show. FLATTER ME ZEN saved ground, was lightly steadied off of a
rival mid turn, made a mild inside run in mid stretch then flattened out late. LOTSA LOU broke outward and brushed with BONITA DIXIE, corrected and
cleared off the inside, ceded to the winner into the turn, stayed on to pursue to upper stretch then faltered.

MIDNIGHT SUSI disputed the pace three wide outside a rival, turned away an inside threat from HIGH FASHION LADY leaving the far turn, moved away
past the three eighths, responded to a strong left handed ask in the stretch and eagerly drew out. HIGH FASHION LADY tracked behind the leaders while in
the two path, moved up between runners to briefly threaten leaving the far turn, eased out with pursuit and brushed with MEAN ELENITA entering the lane,
straightened away and kept on with effort to earn the place. MEAN ELENITA chased the leaders three wide, took closer order nearing the five sixteenths,
saw the winner get away soon after, lightly brushed with HIGH FASHION LADY into the lane then was out finished outside that rival for second. OUT OF
STARS broke outward, raced off the pace while off the inside and failed to respond. ISLAND BEAUTY vied inside the winner around the first turn and
through the backstretch run, failed to kick on leaving the three eighths, faltered and was eased in the drive.

JIMMY'S WILD BOY prompted the pace three wide outside SILENT REASON, moved to apply more pressure into the far turn, wrested command past the
three eighths, edged clear under a drive in upper stretch, widened the advantage near the furlong grounds, switched to his left lead soon after, kept on while
wandering inside the sixteenth pole, switched back to his correct lead and dug in under a drive to fend off FREE AGAIN. FREE AGAIN angled out into the
first turn and rated within range about four to five wide, came under a ride pursuing the leaders past the three eighths, remained well wide into the stretch
and made a grinding run to steadily gain. SILENT REASON took over between runners into the first turn, set a pressured pace in the two path, dueled
leaving the far turn, stayed on with pursuit to upper stretch then weakened. MAGIC STORM spotted the field multiple lengths when unprepared as the gates
sprung, trailed while saving ground leaving the far turn and dropped further back through the drive.

INESPERADO went clear into the first turn and was guided to the three path, was nicely rated through the backstretch run, repelled an outside challenge
leaving the five sixteenths, responded when shaken up soon into the lane, opened up and was kept to steady hand encouragement. EAST RAND , in range
in the two path and to the inside of rivals, moved menacingly under pressure past the five sixteenths, eased out some to give hard chase from the three
sixteenths, kept on willingly and held down the place. FAR WEST prompted the early pace four wide and between runners, chased behind the leaders
nearing the quarter pole, angled out wider for the drive and came back on with good energy through the final sixteenth. PONTI PRIDE broke a beat slow,
raced off the pace while saving ground leaving the far turn, swung out in the drive but failed to menace. PUSH THROUGH , five wide stalking the pace,
moved up to loom mid way on the final turn, failed to kick on in upper stretch and gave way.

LUCY L broke outward, corrected and was nudged along three wide tracking a contested early pace, went on the attack and bid three deep leaving the far
turn, took over mid turn, turned away an outside threat soon after, responded to firm encouragement to widen in mid stretch, drifted out some and held firm.
LADY LANA , four wide outside the winner, ranged up under pressure past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase from there and stayed on well to be clearly
second best. CLAY'S OPAL INDY , off the pace while saving ground, slipped through to the inside of rivals near mid stretch, continued on with effort and
saved the show. FLIPLIT , off the pace and outside a rival, raced between rivals in upper stretch and churned on. GHOST OF GENEVIEVE disputed the
pace two wide outside a rival, ceded to the winner mid turn, failed to keep pace in upper stretch and weakened through the final furlong. FLAG SALUTE vied
inside, eased back a bit nearing the quarter pole, altered out five wide for the drive and weakened.
