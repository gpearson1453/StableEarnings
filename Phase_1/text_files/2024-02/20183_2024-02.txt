final furlong and prevailed late. SENSIBLE JIM stalked two wide, then chased the leader, bid on the far turn outside of SAILOR'S RETURN, gained a short
lead, then hook up with the winner, dueled outside of that rival in the stretch drive and dug in gamely to the end. PREDOMINATE was outrun early, moved
up on the turn, went four wide past the quarter pole, rallied outside in the stretch and was up for third. DAD'S ON A ROLL raced off the pace inside, went
three wide past the quarter pole and rallied mildly. SAILOR'S RETURN set the pace racing with a clear lead, dueled on the far turn and tired. GIVE IT A GO
tracked on the inside, chased on the far turn and faded. PORSUPUESTO raced three wide early and was outrun.

up outside, reached even terms in midstretch but was outfinished. SEA TRIDENT set the pace off the inside then was taken up tiring in midstretch. DIXIE'S
TWO STENTS chased off the pace, angled inside on the turn with a mild rally. CATCH THE SMOKE raced off the leaders outside and lacked a response.
EBBEN flashed speed in the two path opening quarter then retreated. CHAIN REACTION dropped back wide early and trailed throughout. The stewards
posted an inquiry into the stretch run and the rider of the third finisher claimed foul against the first two finishers but the result was allowed to stand.
