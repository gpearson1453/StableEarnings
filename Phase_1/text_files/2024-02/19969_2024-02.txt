Footnotes
OH GLORIOUS DAY tracked the leaders through the first turn and down the backside from four wide, rallied in the ar turn to take command and drew clear
convincingly. SWEET MOBILTEE stalked the pacesetters from between rivals to the far tun, rallied on the final bend and kept on down the lane to hold the
place. COMMISSIONER D unhurried for the first half mile to trail, made a steady advance coming for home and was gaining late in the drive.
DANZANITEAWAY reserved off the leaders to be mid-pack, searched for racing room down the backside while held up off the leaders, mounted a mild bid
on the turn and failed to sustain the rally. SPUNKY ONE went evenly never posing a threat. HISTORYINTHEMAKING pressed the pace form the rail and
was through early. MY TWO JAKES set a pressured pace, came up empty entering the final bend and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
IVORY SKY raced wide into the first turn, tracked the leaders from three wide down the backside, rallied four wide to take command turning for home,
opened a clear advantage and held well. C V SHACKLES set a pressured pace from the fence to the quarter pole, was overhauled by the winner at the
head of the lane and came on again in deep stretch in a game effort. BLUE NOMORE tracked the leaders to the far turn, dropped back losing position on
the final bend and came on again through the lane with a mild bid. STORMED OUT well placed into the far turn, rallied on the bend to loom large at the
quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. MY HOMBRE missed the break giving the field several lengths from the gate, trailed to the top of the stretch and
passed weakened rivals in the lane. MOR CRAFTY went evenly as a non-threat. MAILS HERE pressed the pace for a half mile and gave way.

AWESOME SUNDAY unhurried early to trail the field, circled the pack angling six wide at the head of the stretch and closed well to be going away
decisively. SIERRA DIAMOND stalked the pace into the turn, rallied three wide to take command and open a clear advantage in upper stretch, was no
match for the winner and held on for the place. MAUREENLOVESFRANK tracked the leaders through the turn and made a mild belated bid in the lane.
BLAZING ZENNA reserved in mid-pack, saved ground through the turn and failed to gain ground in the drive. HIGH SPEED set a pressured pace to midway
on the turn and weakened. MISS OVER THERE posed no threat. VACATION SECRET pressed the pace and gave way.

INSIDE STUNT stalked the pacesetter through the turn, rallied turning for home in a steady advance and wore the front-runner down in the drive. WILDCAT
EXPRESS set the pace on a clear lead to midway down the lane and was out-finished late. MOESTER reserved off the pace in mid-pack and mounted a
mild bid in the stretch to gain the show. POSEIDON'S SON tracked the pace through the turn in striking distance and failed to mount a closing rally.
KERANOS trailed to the quarter pole and passed weakened rivals in the stretch. SENSEI LAWRENCE contended along the rail to be prominent on the turn
and faded coming home. YOU ARE AWESOME was never a threat.

Footnotes
MOMENT IN THE DARK set a well rated pace with a comfortable lead to the head of the lane, shook free in upper stretch and drew away. REDDEN
prompted the pace throughout, made a bid nearing the quarter pole, could not match the winner and finished willingly to be second best. KENNEDY'S
CAMELOT reserved to race mid-pack into the turn and mounted a late rally in the lane to gain the show. RUNAWAY RUSSELL stalked the pace to be well
positioned in the turn and failed to mount a closing bid. WHY KENNY WHY raced near the rear of the field most of the way and passed tiring rivals in the
stretch. MY TICKET went evenly failing to threaten. A P'S RUNAWAY DIVA broke awkwardly causing the rider to lose the irons and causing him to lose all
chance. FORMYBOYS chased the early pace and faded.
