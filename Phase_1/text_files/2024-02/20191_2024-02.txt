save ground around the far turn and tired in the lane. BOCCABELLA was fractious in the gate, rearing up just before the gates opened, broke slowly and
veered in at the start, raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the two path and made no bid. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE

TICKET TO THE TOP pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path and kicked clear in the lane. MR.
LEFTY chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and kept on to the finish. THAT MAGIC MOMENT bumped with
the horses to either side leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the leader on the outside through the opening quarter, came around the bend in the four path
and kept on from there. MITOLE'S WISH tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and was
outkicked in the stretch. AWESOME FANTASY bumped repeatedly with the horses to both sides at the start, raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
early, began a bid from the five path coming around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. READY FOR ACTION raced in the middle of the pack
on the inside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and finished evenly. SOUTHERN PASS TIME bumped lightly with the
horse to his outside at the break, recovered to lead the way on the rail up the backstretch, battled from the two path around the bend and faded in the
stretch. VENEZUELAN FEELING stumbled and bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace through the opening stages, came
around the turn in the three path and never threatened. DOWNEY'S WAY trailed the field on the inside early, came around the turn in the two path and
made no bid. THE BIG BROWNBEAST bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, trailed the field from the outside up the backstretch, continued
around the turn in the four path and was empty from there. TIZART raced at the back of the pack through the opening quarter, saved ground around the
bend and was never a factor.
