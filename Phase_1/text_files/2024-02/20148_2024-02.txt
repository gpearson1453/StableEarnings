Footnotes
FOXY CARA was coaxed along on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, chased in the four path on the turn, made a bid inside the
five-sixteenths pole, took the advantage into upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up into the final furlong and drew away under strong urging. EASTERN
STAR was away alertly, ducked in early then was straightened by the rider, showed the way down the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path,
was asked coming to the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage into upper stretch, battled with the winner to near the furlong marker then proved no match
while clear for the place. HAPPY'S SMILE steadied briefly when EASTERN STAR ducked in early, was well placed just off the pace, saved ground on the
turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths, came off the rail into the stretch then moved further out and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
MOONLIT WEEKEND tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the turn, moved out under the crop in upper stretch and tired. SHE'S A
NATURAL had the rider fall back in the saddle at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a couple lengths, settled off the pace, was urged along late on
the backstretch, went three then four wide on the turn, remained on her inside lead in the drive and failed to rally. KRYSTALHEIR broke in and hit the gate
then dropped back, angled to the outside early, was urged along at the rear, went five wide on the turn, drifted in outside the furlong marker and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
AMARETTI established the front from the get go and showed the way in hand two to three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the inside
through the turn patiently handled and was given a notch to work with five-sixteenths from home, slipped away and took the inside route into upper stretch,
drew off under taps to the right shoulder from a tucked crop and held clear to the finish. KID'S LAST LAUGH chased three to four paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, proved no match
for the top one while closing well to secure the place honors. MONGOLIAN PANTHER chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, kept on to procure the show honors. KITTEN'S APPEAL chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. OBRIGADA chased three then two wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home, weakened in the stretch. RISK FREE chased two to three wide down the
backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn, came under coaxing midway, angled out five wide at the head of the stretch, made no impact.
FANCY AZTECA coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped four wide at the top of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
PATRICIA ANN went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a foe, moved clear late on the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path on the
turn, responded well when roused for her best into upper stretch and held under strong urging. JUST MUSIC brushed with a foe at the start, settled off the
pace, was shuffled back behind COLORFUL LADY at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped from the two path to the rail near the three-eighths pole, steadied
off heels around the five-sixteenths then slipped through inside of an opponent, moved out in pursuit of the winner in upper stretch, gained in the final
furlong and finished well but was too late while well clear for the place. SWEET DISTRACTION broke a half-step slow, tracked the pace on the outside,
chased in the four path on the turn and tired while able to get the show. CHANTILLY ROAD lost her footing at the start and was off slow, settled at the rear,
was urged along late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn and failed to threaten. GROWTH RATE lost her footing some at
the start but broke with the field, was well placed just off the pace, chased inside to the two path on the turn and came up empty. COLORFUL LADY
prompted the pace on the outside, dropped back in the three then four path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered.

MAGICAL WAYS got bumped between foes and was squeezed back at the break conceding four lengths to the front before settling into stride, chased five
paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper
stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth out, then inched away in the late stages. PROVEN HOPE four then three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing
at the three-eighths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild kick. NOTAH stumbled at the start breaking in front despite it, dueled early
on with BARNSTORMING before vying outside a pair of rivals through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung four wide into upper
stretch, dug in under a drive and was caught a sixteenth out, kept on clear for the show honors. SEEKING UNITY broke out at the start bumping
MAGINIFICENT MILE into pressure outside from SCREAMING UNCLE, ranged up after the start to vie inside a pair before emerging to duel with the
aforementioned foe through the latter portion of the turn, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. BARNSTORMING
dueled from the three path down the backstretch before vying between foes just off the inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths,
swung three wide for home, weakened in the stretch. SCREAMING UNCLE broke in at the start bumping a pair of rivals between against pressure from the
rail from SEEKING UNITY, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.
MAGNIFICENT MILE stumbled at the start, then got bumped between foes conceding four lengths to the front, chased three wide until tucked inside through
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WHISTLER'S STYLE settled on the outside, moved closer late on the backstretch, gained to make a bid in the four path early on the turn, led in the three
path passing the five-sixteenths pole, shook clear under a drive in upper stretch and proved best under strong urging. DIVINE CROSS angled in while going
to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, moved clear near the nine-sixteenths, was asked while inside on the turn, lost the lead near the
five-sixteenths, fought with the winner into upper stretch and was outfinished while clear for the place. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE was well placed just off the
pace, chased inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path and tired while able to get the show. GOOD PENNY moved in while settling off the
pace, was urged while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn and lacked the needed response. JOEY THE FISH settled off the pace, was
urged along passing the five-eighths pole, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to rally. TRADE SECRET settled at the rear, angled out near the
three-quarter pole, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOLIDAY JAZZ was restless in the gate
then broke awkwardly, stalked the pace on the outside, dropped back three then four wide on the turn and capitulated. VEGAS WEEKEND broke out then
stumbled, settled off the pace, saved ground under urging on the turn and failed to respond. VALLARAND was hustled from the gate, moved in near the
three-quarter pole, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. JOLLY MISS JILL prompted the pace on the
outside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, chased two then three wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
THE SHOE LADY established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route
into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive to prevail. ARIANA RYE broke in at the start bumping SAVANNAH DANCER into RAININGATTHEBEACH,
chased five then four wide before tucking three wide through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three wide into upper stretch,
proved no match for the top one, ran on to secure the place honors. FIVE TO TWO chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, kept on to secure the show honors. FIND YOUR JOY chased three then two
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, weakened. RAININGATTHEBEACH broke in striking the near
side stall at the start, then got bumped by SAVANNAH DANCER due to pressure from ARIANA RYE, chased three then two wide detached at the tail of the
field, went four to five wide into upper stretch, passed a pair of tired rivals but was unable to make an impact. SAVANNAH DANCER got bumped at the start
by ARIANA RYE and in turn bumped the aforementioned foe, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the
turn getting placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. SONIA'S FLAME hard to load prior to the start, chased
along the inside, got out a bit and went three wide into the turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch,
tired, and was eased home to the finish.

Footnotes
WHITTINGTON PARK coaxed from the gate, chased four then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch,
closed well steadily gaining on the once clear leader to latch on inside the final seventy yards and was up in the last three jumps to the finish to score.
ANEJO chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn and advanced to sweep to the front three furlongs from home,
tucked three then two wide and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drew clear under a drive, dug in under growing lone threat to the outside and was
caught in the final strides to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. DR ARDITO chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. OVERSTEP stumbled at the start, chased just off the
inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAMA'S GOLD showed the way in hand along
the inside coming under some pressure from a pair nearing the half mile pole, came under coaxing as ANEJO advanced outside and was overhauled on the
front near the three-eighths, chased under a drive and took the inside route into upper stretch, then tired through to the finish. MAKER'S CANDY raced four
then three wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing near the three-eighths when ANEJO advanced outside, got placed to a protective hold
nearing the quarter pole, then got pulled up near the eighth pole and was subsequently vanned off.
