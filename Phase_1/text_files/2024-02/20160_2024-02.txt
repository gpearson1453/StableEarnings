Footnotes
FLAT OUT PERFECT maintained a steady drive while tracking the pace from the two path, then inched up throughout the turn, took the lead at the quarter
marker then pulled away to hold onto the win in the end. HE'S CHARMING was away well, then chased the pace from the three path into the turn, dug in the
early stretch then continued to charge down the land but was only successful in chasing the cleared leader. TRICKTONITE gained command in the early
backstretch, continued to lead by a short margin throughout the turn, was overtaken in the early stretch by an outer rival and gave way in the end. TIME
BEAN chase the pace from the inside, steadied in the early backstretch then flattened out and needed rally in the end.

TAKE MY PICTURE raced behind the field into the first turn, was well reserved down the backstretch in the two path, then advanced on the second turn,
dug in gamely to edge pass an inner rival in the final furlong and was up just in time. ATHENA D'ORO was bumped at the break, then raced in the middle of
the field while two wide, was moving up throughout the far turn, gained command at the eighth marker, was under a gamely drive before being out finished
in the end. RIVER'S END led the way into the first turn, was under a laxed hand ride down the backstretch, continued to hold the pace throughout the far
turn before faltering in the home stretch. THEHUNKSCLASSYLADY chased the pace while two wide under a moderate pace down the backstretch and into
the far turn, then bid in the early stretch but did not have enough in the end. SHE'S CANDIFIED stalked the pace while two wide in the early furlongs, was in
a long drive heading into the far turn, then flattened out in the final furlongs. SOLECITA was bumped at the start, then chased the pace from the inside in the
early furlongs, then lost momentum after the half and had no final bid in the end. GHURAIR IS JIM was unhurried early and no threat. GOLDEN SLEW

Footnotes
SHARP LIKENESS was well rated between rivals while chasing the pace down the backstretch, then urged steadily on the turn to menace at the quarter
marker, then pulled away unchallenged down the lane to prove much the best. MISS GOLD chased the pace while three wide, was charging up throughout
the turn from the five path and continued to race gamely down the lane and was best for second place. COPPER KAN stalked the pace while three wide
and outside of rivals, moved up on the turn to take the lead at the quarter pole, then lacked the winning bid on the final furlongs and was best for the show
prize. ANNA UP chased the pace from the inside throughout the early furlongs then bid mildly in the late stretch and came up empty. ROUGH CREEK set
the pace along the rail down the backstretch and into the turn, then was over taken for the lead at the quarter marker and flattened in the stretch. ASTERN
MAID was away well, then prompted the pace down the backstretch from the two path, then faded on the turn and lacked late rally.

duel gamely in late stretch for second position and was just up for the place prize. RED ROSE CAFE tracked the pace along the rail, then bid from the two

Footnotes
STORMIEIS BLUE chased the pace from the inside throughout the early furlongs, continued to be well reserved on the far turn, then bid four to five wide at
the quarter marker to close fast down the lane and be up at the wire to prevail. LOOKIN AT KISSES broke outwardly at the start, then chased the pace while
two wide, urged on throughout the far turn, then found more late to close willingly just missing victory in the end. REBEL CONSORT led the way into the first
turn, then dueled down the backstretch and into the second turn, shook clear in the early stretch to gain command briefly then was out finished in the end.
GASTOWN was impeded at the start, then chased the pace while three wide, bid on the far turn to gain second position in the upper stretch then gave way
in the final furlong. CHA CHA MISSION was unhurried early, then swung five wide leaving the far turn but closed too little too late in the home stretch.
MAYAPRETTY broke inwardly at the start, pressed the pace into the first turn, then dueled down the backstretch before settling back on the far turn then
continued to faded in the late stretch. MOONLIGHT RAIN was unhurried early and no threat.

Footnotes
LIBBIES BABY pressed the pace down the backstretch while two wide, then took over the lead leaving the bend, was challenged by an outer rival in the late
stretch to duel grudgingly in the final yards and was up at the wire. MIZZ FACTOR was well rated while chasing the path from the three path down the
backstretch, was under a steady drive on the turn then met with LIBBIES BABY in late stretch to battle for the win but just missed in the end. MUCH ALOHA
broke inwardly at the start, then saved ground while racing behind the field, made a bid in the late stretch but it was not enough to catch the dueling leaders.
BALI GIRLEE set the pace from the inside, was clear heading into the turn, then was over powered by an outer rival and faltered in the stretch. MEGAN'S
MISS broke outwardly at the start, then settled along the inside, made a mild in the late stretch but came up empty. EXPECT LAVENDER was unhurried
early, bid on the turn and was no threat. FREE DROP GYPSY raced while four wide towards the back of the pack down the backstretch, then urged mildly
on the turn and was no menace in the end. J J JAZZ was bumped on both sides, then raced behind the field and was no threat. There was a STEWARD'S
INQUIRY in regards to interference in the stretch run. After review, no change was made to the order of finish.

Footnotes
DON'TASK DON'TTELL was nicely rated while chasing the pace from the three path down the backstretch, then moved up on the far turn to vie for the lead
between rivals, shook clear in late stretch and was in the final strides to prevail. SEDUCTIVE U S A saved ground in the early furlongs, then came out six
wide leaving the far turn to surged down the lane, passing inner rivals and was up for the place prize. RODEO CHAMP stalked the pace while two wide,
then inched up on the far turn to battle for the lead entering the lane, but lacked the winning bid in late stretch and was best for the show prize. GO SPEED
RACER GO was unhurried early, then moved up the backstretch to rally from the five path leaving the far turn and closed willingly down the lane. MANOR
BORN raced in the middle of the field from the inside, then came out four wide leaving the far turn and closed belatedly in the home stretch missing the
place prize in the end. BROCK ON BY set the pace from the inside, was clear heading into the far turn, then was met with outer rivals to vie for the lead in
the early stretch, was used up and weakened in the end. DRIVEHAPPY settled along the inside and was no threat. NAUTICAL MOON settled behind the
field and was no rally.
