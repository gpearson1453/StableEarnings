Footnotes
VINGATIVA settled off the pace while racing three wide, edged closer around the turn and was up and clear late. TOVIA brushed with GENERAL
ROBINSON at the start, chased the pace two wide, took over turning for home and led until deep stretch. GENERAL ROBINSON brushed at the start, raced
off the pace two and three wide and rallied for the show. SUBTLE FAITH broke a bit slowly, chased the pace inside, tipped two wide nearing the quarter
pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked a rally. WHISKEY DIAMOND sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace along the rail, steadied
when briefly racing erratically near the half-mile pole, led to upper stretch and tired. INDIA PILAGA (ARG) played no factor while racing four wide. TRIBUTE
was outrun inside.

Footnotes
JABRAN set the pace in the two path, was nudged along the inside around the turn, cued while tipping out to the three path at the top of the stretch, and
drew clear. LEGENDARY PHANTOM stalked in the three path, was ridden around the turn, swung from the four path into the lane, and chased on for place.
SPOKEN BLUNTLY raced off the pace in the five path, angled out to the seven path under a drive entering the stretch, and ran on for show. CANAVERO
bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced in range while being prompted along in the five path, was ridden four wide around the turn, but evened out in
the five path down the lane. TAPUCHE broke slowly and raced wellback in the four path, moved up under urging from the two path turning into the lane, but
flattened. UZZIAH trailed along the inside early and was no menace. INSISTING bumped with an outer foe at the start, laid up close in the four path, but lost
the crop while being cued passing the quarter, and gaveway turning into the lane.

Footnotes
BRINGER OF RAIN chased in the four path, ranged up under coaxing in the five path around the far turn, swept to the lead while floating out to the seven
path at the top of the lane, and drew clear. SURROGATE bumped with an inner foe at the start, settled in the four path around the first turn to stalked in the
five path down the backstretch, loomed from the four path around the far turn, but was outfinished by an outer foe in the stretch to be second best.
SPETTRO set the pace in the two path, was cued midway around the far turn, began to fade in the three path passing the eighth pole, but held show.
TEPEU tracked in the three path, was driven around the far turn, and finished evenly from the five path in the stretch. ENDLESS SUNSET bumped with an
outer foe at the start, rated in the three path, was roused from the rail into the far turn, but made no impact from the four path down the lane. KINGDOM ON
PAWS prompted the pace in the four path but backed up around the far turn. GLOBES got fractious in the gate and trailed throughout around the four path.

FOR SOME REASON dueled for the lead in the three path, inched away from an inner foe in the two path rounding the turn, was cued to kick away at the
top of the stretch and held clear. KHOPESH raced wellback in the two path, came under right handed encouragement along the rail rounding the turn,
angled out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for place. HAY HAY HARRY vied for the lead with the winner along the inside, was ridden into
the turn, lost ground turning into the stretch, and faded to show. BIG TOBY raced well off the pace in the five path and never menaced.

cleared. DUBSTEP raced off the pace two and three wide and ran on to gain the place. I BELIEVE IN MAGIC prompted the pace in the three path, steadied
while keen around the first turn, continued to prompt in the three path rounding the far turn, took over in upper stretch, led to the eighth pole and was no
match for the winner from there. BLETCHLEY GIRL raced in range three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. HITS DIFFERENT chased
the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. L. E. GRAY set the pace in the two path and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
MEHLEK trailed along the inside down the backstretch, was cued approaching the quarter, roused from the two path into the stretch, rallied to lead inside of
foes just before the sixteenth, and drew clear. BACKCHAT raced off the pace in the three path, was roused along the inside midway around the far turn,
tipped out to the six path at the top of the stretch, and ran on for place. GAMBLING HOLIDAY tracked in the two path, was coaxed along around the far turn,
floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. THETHRILLOFVICTORY prompted the pace in the three path, bid two wide
around the far turn, was roused from the five path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. SWASHBUCKLE set the pace inside, was ridden around the far
turn, but faded from the three path in the final furlong. STRIDE steadied between foes in the three path midway around the first turn, chased in the three
path down the backstretch, but had to steady again between foes around the five-sixteenths, and made no impact from the seven path down the lane.
BORN A GAMBLER turned his head as the gates opened, rated in the four path but never threatened. K. C. CHIEF got caught five wide around the first
turn, stalked in the four path but was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
LOYAL LOUIE set the pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. VOLKERT prompted the winner in the three path, could not reel that foe in but
lasted for the place. PICO D'ORO raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide turning for home and rallied for the show. DOC AMSTER tracked the pace
four wide and was outkicked in the lane. FROSTED FAITH chased the pace two wide and was one-paced through the lane. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) saved
ground in range and lacked a closing bid. CROSS HASTE was outrun while racing three and four wide.
