Footnotes
HE'S INIT TO WINIT was away in good order and established the early lead, was engaged soon after the break by TIMELY COMFORT and contested the
pace with that rival into the turn, was well handled while disputing moderate fractions to the quarter marker, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear
lead at the furlong marker, drew away into the final sixteenth and was hand urged to the finish as much the best. R HEART OF GOLD unhurried in the early
running while not far back, improved position two to three wide along the turn, shifted four wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, was no match for
the winner in the late stages and ran on to be second best. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was allowed to settle, raced outside of rivals along the turn and came
three to four wide to the quarter marker, shifted in for the drive, was not able to impact the top pair in deep stretch and ran on to secure show honors.
TIMELY COMFORT went up to contest the moderate early pace, disputed outside of HE'S INIT TO WINIT heading into the turn and pressed that rival to the
quarter marker, was outkicked into the stretch, faded in the final furlong and was outfinished for third. LORD FISC chased the moderate early pace from the
inside, shifted three wide for the drive, was outrun to mid-stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
EFFECTIVE GIG broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set the pace into the backstretch run then was prompted through decent fractions
approaching the half-mile pole, was well handled while showing the way into the far turn, shook free of WARRENS CANDY MAN into the stretch and kicked
clear at the furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and was wrapped up in deep stretch for a convincing win. BRANNIGAN bobbled then
was squeezed leaving the start and was away slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, saved ground into the backstretch run and tracked
the decent pace to the half-mile pole, saved all of the ground into the far turn then waited for racing room at the quarter marker, angled three wide for the
drive, closed into the final sixteenth, could not impact the winner in deep stretch and held well for second. STAY LIT allowed to settle in the early stages,
improved position two to three wide along the far turn, finished well in the final furlong, shifted four wide into deep stretch, closed willingly and missed for the
place, while getting up in time to secure show honors. WARRENS CANDY MAN was prominent away from the start, stalked the pace along the first turn
then went up to prompt the pace heading into the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the moderate pace into the far turn, was turned away by
EFFECTIVE GIG into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, weakened into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor awards.
REGULATION DAZED settled off of the early pace while not far back, saved ground into the far turn, offered a mild rally in the drive but needed more in the
late stages. DARK MYSTERY took back off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, was unhurried through the backstretch run and trailed into
the far turn, chased two wide into the stretch and did not factor. DANZ TILL TEN was forwardly placed in the early running, stalked the pace three wide
along the first turn, tracked from the outside along the backstretch run, was well placed while three wide into the second turn, dropped back leaving the
quarter marker and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CLEVER CLOVER hustled to establish forward position leaving the start, assumed command and set a pressured pace into the turn, carved out moderate
fractions while off of the rail and pressured to the quarter marker, shook free into upper stretch and drew clear at the furlong grounds, was kept to task into
the final sixteenth, felt mild pressure from the runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive for the win. LEADING THE PACE prominent in the early stages,
attended to the moderate pace heading into the turn, pressed the pace three wide at the quarter pole, was repelled by CLEVER CLOVER into the stretch
and chased to the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth, put mild pressure on the winner in deep stretch but could not reel that one in and held
well in the end for second. DRUM BUNNY allowed to settle in the early stages, gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, maintained that three wide
path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, closed well into the final sixteenth, was outfinished for second in deep stretch and held well in the
end for third. DADS DREAM took back off of the early pace and tracked from the second flight, gained ground two wide approaching the quarter marker,
chased into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong marker, re-rallied into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for the minor awards. GRAMMY WINNER
stalked the decent early pace three deep, maintained that outside position into the turn and advanced four wide at the quarter marker, raced widest into the
stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, lacked a late response and weakened in deep stretch. THIRSTY BABY tracked the moderate early pace from the
inside, was well positioned into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, saved ground to the top of the lane and was outkicked at mid-stretch, could not
muster a response in deep stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SWEET MILLIE broke sharply and had a length on the field before the first pole, held sway through the turn, opened up when roused at the top of the
stretch and won as the rider pleased. DIVINE PASSAGE was hard ridden from the start to keep contact with the field but was outrun in the early stages,
found a good rhythm racing three wide passing the three furlong pole, drew close at the top of the stretch then continued to run on well to be best of the rest.
VALERIE was floated out a little after the break but was still able to be close up through the initial stages, dropped back some going into the turn then
re-rallied from the seven-sixteenths pole, was kept to task down the stretch and won the nod for the third spot. HARBOR'S BEAUTY broke outward a the
start but was able to press the pace three wide, came under pressure passing the quarter pole, lugged in down the stretch and was outfinished for a minor
award. EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE broke well, then dropped back to last and was outrun and chased the field from far back, did manage to pass a pair of
stragglers in the end. HILLSDALE NATION broke well but chose to track the pacesetting SWEET MILLIE while under snug hold, got stuck on the rail
through the turn with no way out, then was let loose passing the quarter pole, bid briefly but was no match for the eventual winner and flattened out near the
eighth pole. AMMARA broke last the rushed up into contention on the turn, started to struggle to keep up passing the three furlong marker, came under a
ride and dropped out of contention.

IMPERIAL HORNET prominent leaving the start, tracked the fast early pace outside of an inner rival and was well positioned heading into the turn, chased
two to three wide to the quarter marker, tipped four wide for the drive and vied for the lead into upper stretch, took a narrow lead at the furlong pole then was
confronted by MAJOR TOM past mid-stretch, dueled with that rival into the final sixteenth, briefly lost the lead in deep stretch, came again in the final strides
and determinedly dug in to prevail. MAJOR TOM was bumped leaving the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the fast early pace from the
inside, improved position into the turn and chased two wide to the quarter marker, angled five wide into upper stretch and loomed nearing the furlong pole,
drew to even terms with IMPERIAL HORNET inside of the furlong marker and dueled with that rival into the final sixteenth, took a slim lead in deep stretch,
battled gamely into the final strides and just missed for the win, while holding for place honors. MY DOMINATOR bumped by a neighboring rival at the start
and was away slowly, was allowed to settle and trailed into the turn, raced two to three wide to the quarter marker then swung six wide into upper stretch.
rallied while widest at the furlong marker, found his best stride late and closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not catch the top pair in the final strides
and held safely for third. O'BANION (IRE) bobbled at the start and was away a bit slowly, took back off of the fast early pace and saved ground into the turn,
was roused two wide into upper stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. BOSS
NINE showed good speed away from the gate and assumed command in the early stages, drew to a clear lead and set fast fractions into the turn, extended
the lead into the turn and set fast fractions to the quarter marker, drifted out into upper stretch and was confronted heading to the furlong pole, was
overtaken at mid-stretch and faded in the final sixteenth. DRIVER'S ED broke in at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, was hustled to be forwardly
placed in the early running and chased the fast pace to the half-mile pole, saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, re-rallied in upper
stretch and came within aim at the furlong pole, could not sustain that run into deep stretch and flattened out. DR PESCADO broke alertly, conceded the
early lead and chased the fast pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and did not offer a late
rally. ELCONDOR broke in at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, recovered and was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked the fast early
between rivals, came in tight leaving the half-mile marker, stumbled and was shuffled back heading into the turn, chased two to three wide to the quarter
marker and gained ground into the stretch, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and tired.

Footnotes
COWBOY CHARLIE broke sharply, cleared off early, held through the turn, came into the stretch with plenty in reserve and won clear under intermittent
urging. MOB BOSS broke well but ceded the lead to COWBOY CHARLIE, went into a drive from the five-sixteenths pole then was unable to reel in that foe
but finished well to hold the place. TORPEDO AWAY was reserved early, moved to the two path through the turn, responded to strong handling and
produced a rally in the stretch, was slowly gaining on the top pair but came up short. BLAZE OF DREAMS raced between horses in the group chasing the
pacesetter, had to be ridden to keep up passing the three furlong marker, found some life turning for home in the four path and finished willingly. WINTER
FALCON chased the pace from widest of three across the track, came under pressure with three furlongs to run and finished evenly. REFI NOW was taken
in hand from the break but was pulling hard on the rider down the backstretch, angled over to the rail for the run through the turn then swung four wide into
the stretch and lacked a finishing kick. HARBOR OUTLAW broke a step slow then was hustled from the rail, rushed up into contention before the turn, kept
inside through the turn then came up empty in the stretch.

Footnotes
BLETCHLEY PARK assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn then was engaged by AMERICAN FARMER entering the
backstretch run, set modest fractions while prompted by his stablemate heading to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the second turn then drifted out
into upper stretch, battled with AMERICAN FARMER to the furlong pole, dueled while kept to firm urging into the final sixteenth, denied his stablemate the
win in deep stretch and determinedly kept to task in the final strides to prevail. AMERICAN FARMER was away in good order and was prominent heading
into the first turn, stalked the pace along the first turn then advanced to prompt the pace into the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the modest
fractions at the half-mile pole then pressed BLETCHLEY PARK into the far turn, was floated out into upper stretch when BLETCHLEY PARK drifted at that
station, battled with his stablemate to the furlong marker then dueled into the final sixteenth, was denied in deep stretch by the determined winner and was
gamely bested in the final strides, while well clear of the rest for second. ROYAL 'N RANDO tracked the early pace from the outside, went four wide along
the first turn and was well positioned heading into the backstretch run, stalked the modest pace to the half-mile marker then chased three wide into the
second turn, lost ground at mid-stretch and was outkicked into the final sixteenth, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and just held for third at the
finish. PASSARANDO was allowed to settle while never far back in the early going, raced three wide into the backstretch run and tracked the modest pace
to the half-mile marker, lost ground into the second turn and chased to the quarter pole, re-rallied into the stretch and improved position at the furlong
marker, was gaining into the final sixteenth and just missed for third at the wire. FREEPORT JOE forwardly placed leaving the start, was keen into the first
turn and tracked the pace while under a hold heading into the backstretch run, settled into the backstretch and stalked the modest pace to the half-mile pole,
saved ground into the second turn, chased into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, lacked a response in the final sixteenth and weakened in
deep stretch. PERCOLATE (IRE) bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, raced in tight quarters heading into the first turn and came under a snug
early hold, settled into the backstretch run and trailed to the half-mile pole, went three wide into the far turn and did not factor in the stretch. TESORO was
forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the pace two wide into the first turn and was well positioned in the early going, tracked the modest pace to the
half-mile marker, saved ground into the far turn and chased to the quarter pole, lacked a response into the stretch and came up empty in the late stages.

Footnotes
MAGIC CHROME broke well and sat just behind the pacesetting RIDIN'THESTORMOUT through the turn, took command at the quarter pole, met a
challenge by STORMY ROUGE in the stretch, refused to let that one get by and finished out well under a strong hand ride to prevail. STORMY ROUGE
came away well and was up with the early leaders four wide, advanced through the turn, came four wide into the stretch and ran on well but could not get
past the winner in the stretch. ROSE OF MOONCOIN settled inside just off the pace, waited for running room through the turn, got a big hole on the rail at
the three-sixteenths pole, ran on well under steady handling, was gaining ground late but was unable to catch the top pair. ALONG CAME JOANN bumped
repeatedly with SPARKLE SWEETLY after the break then moved to the inside away from the trouble, raced between horses near the rear of the field down
the backstretch, kept to the inside through the turn, came into the stretch behind a wall of horses, angled out to the four path, and was improving in the end.
SPARKLE SWEETLY was pinballed and squeezed after the break but battled through the bumping to get mid-pack position in the tight pack, then became
boxed in through the turn, tipped four wide into the clear and went into a drive from the quarter pole, had trouble changing leads in the stretch run and
weakened late. RIDIN'THESTORMOUT broke broke a little slowly but rushed up, gained the lead and set a strong pace under pressure from MAGIC
CHROME, held to the quarter pole then gave way under pressure and weakened. JULIET'S KITCHEN exchanged some light bumps with SPARKLE
SWEETLY after the break, raced three wide and was at the rear through the early going, tried to rally on the turn, went five wide into the stretch and
flattened out. LILLY'S JOURNEY hesitated at the start and was off slowly behind the field, rushed up to join the pack by the five furlong pole, raced inside of
horses at the back of the tight pack to the turn then started to lose ground passing the three furlong marker and was no factor from that point.
