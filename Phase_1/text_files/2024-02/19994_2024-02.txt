Footnotes
AWESOME BIRDIE away in good order, allowed the leader to go early, chased that one into and through the turn off the inside, collared that rival past the
furlong marker, drew clear late under steady handling. ABBY THE BULL DAWG lacked early foot while racing off the inside, came four wide out of the turn,
finished up willingly to earn the place. DOCS SEVEN raced in mid pack, three wide into the turn outside the winner, asked along and followed that rival into
the stretch, bid for the place, outkicked by the runner up late. VARTON broke on top, quickly sprinted well clear, continued to hold a comfortable advantage
far turn, caved in late when confronted by the winner a furlong out. MUMBLEBEE turned in an even effort while saving ground. TENACIOUS LADY moved
off the inside after the start, four wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, weakened in the drive. KOALA dwelt at the start then broke awkwardly to
spot the field several lengths, improved a bit while four wide through the turn, flattened out in the drive. RIGHT TRAPPE remained back in failing to threaten.
SPOILED ROTTEN in the main body while in the two path, began a steady retreat before a half.

Footnotes
ACCELERATING BABE broke out, bumped MAREBELL, was quickly straightened and dueled up front while off the inside up the backstretch and through
the turn, disposed of the other speed when straightened for home, kicked clear. SHESASMALLTOWNGIRL broke toward front, 2nd flight three path,
continued to chase the dueling leaders through the turn, could do little with the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. PENZIG closest to the
dueling leaders toward but not on the inside, went one paced through the lane to prove best of the rest, no threat to the top pair the final furlong.
DIFFERENTLY dueled up front along the inside, first to blink in giving way through the stretch. MISS ANALYZED back off the pace toward the rail, angled
out four wide entering the stretch, managed little in the way of a closing response. PADDY GAL made little in the way of an impact while racing off the
inside. MAREBELL bumped at the start, raced in mid pack inside, went one paced in saving ground to no avail. INTRUSION remained back in lacking a
rally. THAT'S ABOUT IT off slow to trail throughout,.

remaining speed when straightened for home, stayed clear in the run to the wire under steady handling. VIOLENT RIVER behind the pace off the inside,
raced three wide through the turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, well clear of the others. CHROME CANDY away in good order, vied up front
between rivals through the turn, weakened a bit in the drive, saved show. DANCIN ROCKET one paced behind the lead pack, came in the two path for the
drive, went evenly to the wire in lacking a closing response. MY BROTHER MIKE mid pack off the rail, three wide into the lane, improved slightly in upper
stretch without posing a serious threat. BIG ANDY MORT broke back, lacked speed off the rail, came four wide for the drive, also improved position through
upper stretch before flattening out. OUTLAW RUN lacked speed off the inside, made little in the way of an impact. LIGHT HORSE HARRY four wide through
much of the turn, had little left for the drive. SOUTHFORK off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack early, tired through the lane. HELLO MR

Footnotes
RAVEN'S NEST broke out, forwardly placed early, stalled in some traffic turn, angled out to be four wide for the drive, outside bid late, finished with good
resolve to be up at the wire. VALE within striking distance inside, shuffled back a bit into the turn along the rail, moved out to be three wide when advancing
out of the turn, challenged between horses and inside the winner with less than a furlong remaining, missed. BALSA prompted the early leader in the two
path, took over midway on the turn, continued to hold the advantage,caught late. CONTRABANDISTA back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the
stretch, not a threat to the top three wide improving a bit. BOOGIE BODE in mid pack while racing three wide, continued evenly through the stretch in
lacking a closing response. ASYMMETRIC in the main body while racing in the two path, also lacked a rally. SMACKZILLA back off the pace out in the strip,
four to five wide turn, not dangerous in the drive. BELL DOZER broke out but on top, showed the way up the backstretch and the first half of the turn, gave
way when headed,. BORDINOS forwardly placed while three wide, began to fade just before a half. WORK ORDER shuffled back in traffic early, remained
back. HERECOMESTROY off a step slow, trailed.

Footnotes
NOTORIOUS SIXOHTWO broke best of all, set the pace inside, got clear in the turn, remained clear through the lane under steady handling. MASTER OF
DISGUISE chased the winner in the two path throughout, had little for that one in the drive, remained clear for the place. CATALINA CRUSH lacked early
foot just off the inside, steered out to be four to five wide turning into the stretch, lodged a belated rally to be closing the gap on the top two late. PERP
WALK in mid pack while racing outside, came four wide for the drive, mild late interest to improve slightly. PHENOMENAL DREAM last away, devoid of
speed while saving ground into the turn, moved off the inside late in the turn, improved position with some modest late energy. EXPRESS CRUISER off the
pace while along the inside, shuffled a bit in some traffic entering the turn, went evenly when clear for the drive. DIFFERENT FLAME behind the leaders off
the inside, was found lacking through the stretch. MISCHIEVOUS MAX forwardly placed outside, four wide through the turn, tired through the stretch.
GOLDEN DIVERSION was never a threat while racing off the inside. ASK WILLIE tired while four wide through the turn. HANDSOME RASCAL backed up
while racing three wide. SUPERHERO was finished early, far back.

Footnotes
ALEJANDRO last away,lacked speed, swept up four to five wide to take over out of the final turn, well clear, kept to task. EXPENSIVE CUT behind the pace
while four wide through the first turn, settled in the run up the backstretch, three wide through the second bend, proved no match for the winner in thgme
drive. CAMP DAVID chased the early leader to that one's outside, moved up to engage that rival just after a half, dueled through the second turn, offer little
resistance to the top two in the drive, narrowly gained the nod for the show,. ROMAN CENTURIAN lacked speed while saving ground, continued inside
second turn, steered out past the furlong marker, narrowly missed the show. NULLARBOR broke on top, set the pace inside, dueled second turn, faltered
when headed into the lane. SEARCH ENGINE five wide into the first turn, raced back, improved slightly with some mild late interest. ETHICAL
JUDGEMENT made little impact while racing in the two path. PERFECT FLIGHT forwardly placed for a half, gave way. STORMY PATTERN staged a
steady retreat and trailed home.

Footnotes
PAYNE unhurried early along the inside, moved closer in the two path into the lane, dropped to the rail a furlong out, challenged, spirited drive to the wire,
proved best in game fashion. STRAVA forwardly placed inside, moved off the rail, pressured the pace the middle half, challenged outside and vied three
deep past the furlong marker, bumped with PATS PROPERTY late, narrowly gained the nod over that one for the place while being outgamed for the win.
PATS PROPERTY cleared toward the inside through the first turn, set the pace along the inside second turn, responded when confronted into the stretch,
vied between foes the final furlong, late bump, missed the place. OSBOURNE settled off the pace three wide, continued in even fashion in the three path
second bend, lacked a closing punch. MASQUEPARADE void of early foot just off the inside first turn, continued back, three to four wide second turn,
lacked a serious closing kick as well. SANTOS DUMONT moved closer before a half three wide, pressed through the final turn and into the stretch, faltered
the final furlong. COMMANDPERFORMANCE off a step slow, trailed much of the way, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. MAJOR BLUE forwardly placed
along the inside, gave way in the drive. B DAWK finished after five furlongs, continued to back up stretch. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY
REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
YAQUI VALLEY broke on top, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternated for the advantage into the stretch, edging away late under firm handling.
AMAZING SUCCESS dueled up front closest to the inside, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, remained clear for the place. SUNDAY SPIRIT
ducked in at the start to be off a couple of lengths, moved up to midpack toward the inside, three wide for the drive, finished with some late energy to be
clear of the others, slow gain for the place. CHEZ WHIZ lacked speed off the inside, raced three wide through the turn, improved a bit while never a serious
threat from between horses. STREAKIN DEACON back off the pace outside, four to five wide through the turn, went evenly through the stretch. GREAT
BARRIER behind first flight, three to the two path through the turn, moved to the rail, had little left late. SECRET HONOR forwardly placed, moved a bit
closer to the top two turning for home then weakened in the drive. EMPYREAL SHADOW void of speed outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a closing
kick. REVEILLE VALLEY off a step slow, remained back while racing in the two path. HARD LUCK HENRY off the pace and the inside, dropped to the rail
late in the turn, tired through the stretch. DEVIL'S SHADOW off a step slow, trailed throughout,.
