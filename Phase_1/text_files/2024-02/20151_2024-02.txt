GIRL AFRAID dueled for the lead two wide, then drew off under a drive. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF trailed in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper
stretch and rallied to edge place in the late stages. HANNAH'S HAVEN stalked the top pair from the three path, chased the clearing leader to gain place
passing the three sixteenths pole, but was bested by an outer bidder for that position in the final sixteenth. IZE SMILING laid off of the pace in the four path,
chased before getting outkicked for minor placings by an outer rival in the final furlong and lacked a bid. COPPER MOON dueled for the lead inside of the
eventual winner, but proved no match for that one in upper stretch and weakened. LAYLA'S SONG chased along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
STORM BAY stalked along the inside, searched for racing room just behind the leader entering the lane, slipped through to offer a rail bid at the furlong
grounds and drove past in the closing stages. SWEET ALYSSA pressed outside of the leader, got floated three wide by that one while chasing in upper
stretch, bid along with an inner rival at the furlong grounds, vied into the final sixteenth but got outkicked. THEROANRUNNER was bumped by an inner rival
and exchanged contact with an outer foe at the start, showed the way along the inside via a lightly pressured advantage, held firm entering the lane, but
drifted off the fence at the three sixteenths pole, dug in between bidders at the furlong grounds but yielded to them with a sixteenth to go. NOW YUS CANT
LEAVE tracked three wide and chased evenly. BAG LADY lunged outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, laid off of the pace two wide and between
horses, took the far turn in the three path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch and ran on mildly. TANGO ZULU leaned out and broke a step slow at the
start, lagged behind along the inside into the far tur, shifted out to the five path entering the lane after moving out of last, but failed to menace. FOR
HARPER steadied between rivals into the first turn, settled along the inside around the bend, saved ground and tired. TOUGH LEGACY bumped with an
inner rival at the start, steadied when put to crowded quarters among foes approaching the first turn, raced off of the pace in the four path and was done
early.

Footnotes
PASSING JUDGMENT stalked along the inside, shifted off the rail to search for racing room entering the lane, yet tipped back in for clear rail sailing in
upper stretch, bid inside of the leader at the furlong grounds and edged past. TUSSLING CHARLIE showed the way along the inside, spun for home just off
the inner rail, met an inner challenge at the furlong grounds but was bested in the late stages. CONTRABAND EARLY stalked three wide, drifted to the four
path entering the lane, then chased the top pair while hanging on his left lead. MISTERHOLYROLLER was bumped and pinched between horses at the
start, settled off of the pace along the inside, lost position to an inner rival down the backstretch, then shifted out to the five path in midstretch and ran on
while one paced on his left lead. BOSTON BLITZ broke out and bumped a rival at the start, lacked speed along the inside, improved inside of foes
approaching the far turn, saved ground around that bend, then chased evenly. CATCH ME T lacked speed three wide, advanced five wide and outside of
foes around the far turn, spun to the six path entering the lane and moved up while hanging on his left lead. PRINCE PERFECTA laid off of the pace three
to two wide, entered the lane in the four path before moving out to the eight path entering midstretch, ran on mildly but failed to menace. RIGHTEOUS
FREEDOM brushed with an outer rival at the start, steadied and bore wide into the first turn, trailed tucking to the two path, took the far turn in the three
path, moved out to the nine path nearing midstretch and passed tired rivals. TEMPLE OF PEACE brushed with an inner foe at the start, laid off of the pace
in the four path and yielded between horses. GORDITO HERMOSO pressed outside of the leader but weakened between horses in upper stretch.
YOCKEY'S DRIVETHRU was firmly bumped by an outer rival, forced in and bumped a inner foe at the start, pursued from midpack two wide, then in the
three path and between horses around the far turn and tired. PURRRFECT RHYTHM broke inwardly and squarely bumped a rival at the start, laid off of the
pace two wide and was done early.

Footnotes
SILVER HALO was stubbornly reluctant to load, set the pace along the inside, drew off in upper stretch and was ridden out under mild urging. AIR IT OUT
laid off of the pace four wide and ran on to edge place in the final sixteenth. CRIMINAL INTENT shifted out and bumped a rival soon after the start, stalked
outside of the eventual winner, failed to sustain pressure in upper stretch, chased hanging on his left lead and lost place late. BROWNSTONE was bumped
by an inner rival soon after the start, raced off of the pace in the three path and between horses, shifted outside of rivals and to the five path in upper stretch,
then moved up. ON MY HONOR was hesitant to load after a prior rival did the same, dropped back early, trailed in the two path, then moved up between
horses in midstretch. TEEN IDOL broke a step slow and was shuffled back when an inner rival shifted across his path at the start, laid off of the pace along
the inside, took closer order before encountering traffic in the two path at the five sixteenths pole, tipped out in upper stretch but required a firm left rein from
drifting wider in the process, then came up empty and yielded between foes. PARTYVICIOUS broke a beat slow, chased forwardly along the inside and
weakened. IRON MAN IRA broke a step slow, tracked three wide but weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BOSS' DIALIN IN lacked speed while saving ground around the turn, launched a rally in upper stretch, progressed well to bid outside of the leader at the
sixteenth pole and surged clear. TAPE TO TAPE dueled for the lead with an outer rival, cleared that one in upper stretch, but was collared at the sixteenth
pole, yielded yet lasted for place. POWERFUL tracked along the inside, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, chased to bid for place at the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked by an inner rival at that marker. OCEAN OF STORMS trailed in the two path then ran on to improve position. SAINT SELBY
dueled for the lead two wide, but gave way in upper stretch and caved between horses. OMAHA RED chased in the four to five path and gave way.
BRIDLEUPTOTHEBAR stuttered a step and floated outwardly to be off a step slow, raced off of the pace in the three path, drifted inwardly at the three
sixteenths pole and made little impact. OFFICER QUIGLEY chased in the three to four path and weakened on his left lead.

Footnotes
MY PAL MATTIE was tough to load, broke inwardly, set the pace along the inside, drew clear entering the lane, hung on his left lead and lasted. BRIAN'S
IRON MIKE settled off of the pace in the two path, shfited out to the five to six path in upper stretch, rallied and vied for place with an inner rival while closing
in on the tiring leader in the late stages, and prevailed for place while running out of ground to reel in the leader. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN pursued from
midpack along the inside, shifted off the rail entering the lane, split foes two wide passing the three sixteenths pole, shifted out inside of the final furlong to
spar with an outer foe for place, but missed. HOORAY AUSTIN raced towards the rear in the three path, shifted to the five path entering the lane and moved
up late. SWOT ANALYSIS tracked in the three path, tipped to the four path entering the lane and lacked a bid. GEAUX SUGAR pressed two wide, chased
around the turn, but gave way entering the lane and faded between horses. FIESTY FIST raced at the rear along the inside and made little impact. NOT ON
HERB tracked inside of a rival while a path off the inner rail around the turn, chased in upper stretch and faded.

Footnotes
ACCOMMODATE EVA was bumped between rivals at the start, tracked from midpack two wide and between horses, pursued with run just behind the
leaders three wide and among foes turning for home, smoothly tipped to bid four wide entering the lane and kicked clear. EMILY'S BULLET took contact
from outer rivals and got knocked off stride soon after the start, settled off o the pace along the inside, shifted outside of rivals and to the five path in upper
stretch, then rallied to gain place in the final sixteenth. LIGHTOFMAINE leaned out and bumped a rival at the start before being knocked into an inner foe
soon after, stalked along the inside, but was blocked and shuffled back behind a tiring rival nearing the lane, shifted out and re-rallied three wide and
between horses to narrowly reach show. CLEARLY A TEST leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, pressed two wide, bid along with an outer rival turning
for home, got outkicked by a wider bidder in upper stretch, kept on willingly but got nailed at the wire for show. MAGNOLIA AVENUE broke a step slow, was
floated inwardly and put to crowded quarters by an outer foe forcing her to bump an inner rival at the start, settled off of the pace four wide, inched closer
under urging around the far turn, got outkicked while getting floated three wide entering the lane and yielded. TOMMIE G broke inwardly and forced trouble
for inner rivals, stalked three wide, bid at the quarter pole, vied entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch and faded between
horses. PLUM WINE broke a step slow before being bumped by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the three path, swung out to the eight path in upper
stretch and failed to factor. WONDERRAND dislodged her rider pre-race, set the pace along the inside, got headed by a pair of outer bidders at the quarter
pole and stopped.

Footnotes
JUST BETTER broke inwardly, tracked three wide, took the far turn in the four path, sustained a grinding charge to reel in the leader leaving the furlong
grounds, led into the final sixteenth and found the wire before an outer on-charging bidder. REMUNZEL was bumped between horses at the start, pursued
from midpack in the two path, tipped to the four path in upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the new leader in the shadow of the wire but came up short.
PURR FACTOR pulled into the first turn to vie for the lead with an outer rival, inherited a clear advantage after that one faltered into the far turn, met an
outer challenge at the furlong grounds, was bested entering the final sixteenth and yielded. LADY OF POWER lacked speed along the inside, pursued three
wide and between horses around the far turn, shifted out to the seven pah in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. UNION MIST bumped an inner rival around
the first turn, pursued from off of the pace two wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch and leveled off.
CARNANE (IRE) tracked two wide before tucking inside down the backstretch, but yielded position to outer rivals entering the far turn, then kept on between
foes in the final furlong. SWEET SUNSHINE bumped with an outer rival at the first turn, steadied when bumped by an outer rival around the first urn, settled
well back in the three path, shifted out to the seven path advancing in upper stretch but failed to threaten. HELEN'S LITTLE SIS bumped an inner rival at the
start, stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the leader around the far turn, chased that one in upper stretch and faded. PACE'S TWO SENSE
steadied entering the first turn, lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. SARANAC LAKE was bumped between horses at the start, bore very
wide while railing into the first turn, lagged behind and surpassed tired rivals. ANNICK (FR) led from an inner vying rival then weakened in the three path
around the far turn. AUNT ALEX laid off of the pace in the four path and faded around the far turn.

Footnotes
BRITTANY'S DREAM pursued from midpack along the inside before moving outside of a faltering foe approaching the backstretch, tracked before bumping
an outer foe to tip four wide and between horses entering the lane, but lacked a kick in upper stretch, chased before tipping inside of the top pair at the
furlong grounds and edged past in the final sixteenth. EL DINERO was bumped between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, tipped and
gained four to five wide entering the lane, bid while shifting inwardly in upper stretch, vied through midstretch but was outkicked by an inner bidder late.
GOOD AND STOUT broke outwardly and bumped a foe at the start, stalked close up from the two path, awaited racing room just off the leaders around the
far turn, tipped three wide and between foes entering the lane, bid and vied with an outer rival through midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner bidder late.
TAKE CHARGE J J tracked four to three wide, yielded between horses turning for home, swung out to the eight path entering upper stretch and kept on to
reclaim a minor share. SPINNING ACES bumped an inner rival at the start, pressed three to two wide into the backstretch, vied around the far turn, but was
headed by outer rivals in upper stretch and faded. BONS TEMPS ROULE was bumped and pinched between horses causing him to steady hard among
foes at the start, trailed into the far turn and moved up. COURT JESTER was bumped between horse and squeezed back at the start, raced off of the pace
in the two path, steadied behind foes around the first turn and failed to factor. HOUSE BOURBON was bumped between horses at the start, pursued from
midpack five to four wide, but was bumped by an inner rival and steadied between horses entering the lane, then readily caved. CARPIS set the pace, vied
with an outer presser around the far turn and weakened in upper stretch. RISING KOTO STAR raced forwardly along the inside into the first turn, but
faltered approaching the backstretch and was done early.
