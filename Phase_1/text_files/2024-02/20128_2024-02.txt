Footnotes
BROADWAY SKY hustled up the fence to take the lead into the first turn, set a well rated pace in hand down the backside, maintained the advantage
through the fianl turn and drew off when called upon in upper stretch as much best. CAPTURE MI prompted the pace to the far turn, made a two wide bid
turning for home, was no match for the winner and finished willingly as second best. BARRELHOUSE tracked the leaders to the far turn, was set to an early
drive and lacked a closing response. ON HIS TOES trailed to the final bend and never posed a threat. SILVER MATT chased the pace for a half mile and
faded.

Footnotes
STEP AHEAD unhurried for the first half, rallied three wide steadily closing ground on the far turn, quickly cleared the field in mid-stretch and improved the
advantage to the wire. TWELVE MINUS ONE slow early to be at the rear of the field, made a steady advance on the final bend following the winner and
chased that one home to gain the place. ROYAL AIR FORCE tracked from five wide down the backstretch and rallied mildly down the lane. MO SNOW well
placed at the head of the tracking pack to the far turn and failed to close ground. ELEGGUA was up close tracking the leaders in the first turn, dropped back
losing position down the backside and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. RANSAM PAYNTER sped to a clear lead on the first turn, maintained that
advantage to the quarter pole and tired through the lane while drifting out considerably. WILEY T chased the pacesetter to the final bend, rallied mildly to
upper stretch and faded in the drive. MR. BLUTARSKY raced up the fence down the backside to mount a mild rally and flattened out in the final turn.

ANGEL'S DESTINY slow early to trail, split rivals on the turn rallying from the back, angled seven wide at the top of the lane and closed with a rush to be
going away at the wire. HOLLYS SUPER STAR set the pace under early pressure, opened a clear advantage on the turn, widened in upper stretch and
weakened inside the sixteenth pole. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN tracked the leaders to the turn, rallied to loom at the quarter pole and failed to sustain the
bid. TITEBLUEJEANS pressed the pace and steadily weakened coming home. HALO EFFECT raced wide throughout and failed to mount a rally. OH EYE
SEE raced up into content on the turn and flattened out. STARLITESLEW was never a threat. PENNY'S TREASURE well placed in the early going and was
through midway on the turn.

Footnotes
NATURE OFTHE BEAST unhurried early to be at the rear of the field, steadily gained ground while circling five wide and surged late to be up in time.
WHEN IN ROME set a pressured early pace, shook off the early pressure, engaged by the stalker midway on the turn, battled with that one to the wire,
outgamed the show finisher in deep stretch only to be caught by the late closer in a game effort. OUTSLEWTHEM stalked th pacesetters to the turn,
engaged the leader at the quarter pole, dueled with that one to the wire and was out-finished in the final strides. KALINBA hustled to press the pace for
three-eighths and faded in the stretch. MINDSHIP Q tracked the leaders from the fence down the backside and failed to mount a rally.

MOBIL CHIC reserved off the early pace, rallied five wide in the turn and steadily advanced to gain the place. HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE prompted the pace to
the turn, made a bid nearing the quarter pole and failed to sustain the rally. LINE DANCER contended early and flattened out in the turn. KEEN

Footnotes
MAILS HERE stalked the pace to the turn, rallied up the fence to engage the leaders, cut the corner to take command, drew clear and held the advantage to
the wire. ROMANIAN PRINCE pressed the pace from three wide through the turn, loomed in upper stretch and kept on down the lane to be second best. A
VAN ON THE RUN slow early to trail, moved to contention on the turn while steadily gaining ground and failed to further close the gap. EL SORDO raced
mid-pack throughout and failed to mount a closing rally. STORMED OUT showed brief speed to be on the lead from between horses to midway on the turn
and weakened. COUNTRY STYLE failed to menace running one-paced. LEWIS AND CLARK never threatened.
