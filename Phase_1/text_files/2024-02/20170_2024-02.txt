Footnotes
GRAND MAXIME set the pace along the rail, drew off in upper stretch and held safe under a drive. TITAN was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three
wide, swung six wide in upper stretch, lightly bumped GUAICAIPURO, closed strongly and ran out of ground. SIR BANANA BRIAN had his head turned at
the start, raced in range two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, lacked the needed rally but stayed on for the show. MOBY WARRIOR raced off the
pace two wide and had a mild belated rally. MISTER COOPER chased the winner two wide and weakened in the drive. INTRANSIGENT stalked the pace
inside and faded in the stretch. GUAICAIPURO bumped at the start, raced up close three wide, angled five wide turning for home, bumped in upper stretch
and faltered. HERCULES N LOVE was reluctant to load, raced four wide and made little impact. REBEL JACKSON hit the starting gate, lugged in badly
down the backstretch, raced in the two and three paths around the turn and never threatened. AHORSEWITHNONAME played no factor while racing two
wide. NO MATCH CHARLIE was outrun while racing three wide. AWESOME ROAR trailed throughout.

Footnotes
OLD FLAG (IRE) laid off the pace in the two path, was coaxed in the four path early around the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, and
rallied past inner foes to go clear in the final sixteenth. DANGEROUS DRIVER laid wellback in the two path, was cued early around the far turn, fanned out
to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and kicked on while tipping inwards to get up for place. WHO'S THE KING got bumped by an inner foe early,
tracked in the three path, was coaxed along around the far turn, floated out to the five path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. FIGHT TIL DAWN
veered out an bumped an outer foe early, then steadied early around the first turn, laid in midpack along the inside, had to wait from the rail around the far
turn, then got stymied in the two path around the eighth pole and could not make an impact. OCALA ROCKET showed the way around the first turn to set
the pace in the two path down the backstretch, was roused turning into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong. FLAT CAP got bumped by an inner foe
early, chased in the three path down the backside, was coaxed along from the five path turning into the lane, but made no impact. DIXIE PREACH rated
along the inside, but had to wait along the rail around the far turn, then got stuck in traffic down the lane and could not threaten. WASAMATTAFOYOU
stalked inside but faded in the stretch. ZAPTASTIC trailed in the two path and never menaced. GIURO raced up close in the three path turning into the
backstretch, was coaxed midway around the far turn, but weakened between foes down the lane.

PACK PLAYS stalked in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the four path turning into the stretch, had to alter back
inwards passing the eighth pole, and drew past an outer foe late. BINGO WAS HIS NAME bumped with an inner foe at the start, set the pace in the two
path, was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, and ran on but was caught by an inner foe late to place. GROUP
TICKET tracked inside, was roused midway around the turn, and kept on for show. MIRACLE TRIP bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace
in the two path, tipped out to the three path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. RYE'S MY GUY chased in the five path but did not
factor from the six path down the lane. NO PROBLEM JOE trailed in the two path and did not threaten. OZONE had an awkward start, tracked in the four
path but flattened from the five path in the stretch.

AWESOME ANNMARIE stalked in the four path, was coaxed along around the turn, ranged up to bid in the five path at the top of the lane, and drew clear in
the final furlong. SOPHIA'S STORM prompted the pace in the three path, was ridden into the stretch, and kept on for place. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER set
the pace inside, was cued turning into the stretch, but faded for show. SHE'S OUTTA HERE had to steady early, tracked in the two path but flattened on her
left lead down the lane. A J'S MEMORY trailed along the inside and never threatened. HEIR TO THE ROAR broke out at the start, raced off the pace in the
five path but was no menace.

Footnotes
LOVIN THE PAVELS pressed the pace two wide, took the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear late. CATE'S CHARM set the pace along the rail,
led past the eighth pole and lasted for the place. TRAMONTANE hit the starting gate, stalked the pace from the rail, angled three wide in midstretch and just
missed second. VAZHI raced off the pace two wide, checked midway around the first turn, stayed two wide around most of the far turn, swung seven wide
near the quarter pole and rallied belatedly. ALETTE D'ORO had her head turned at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled six wide in upper stretch
and had a mild gain. TURF ROCKET raced in range two wide between foes while checking incessantly through the opening three furlongs, chased three
wide around the far turn and lacked the needed stretch rally. MY HAPPY HOLIDAY saved ground and failed to menace. PRIVACY SETTING (FR) was no
threat while racing two and three wide. DEFLECTION veered out at the start, chased the pace five wide around the first turn and four wide around the far
turn and faded in the drive. FLIGHT TO PARIS played no factor while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
TIDAL FORCES stalked in the three path, was roused into the far turn, bid midway around the far turn, took the lead nearing the quarter, and dug in from
the two path down the stretch to repel an outer foe. SPIRIT ANIMAL laid in midpack in the three path, ranged up to bid four wide approaching the quarter,
dueled with an inner foe from the three path down the lane, but was repelled late to place. FLY THE W tracked in the two path, had to steady while getting
shutoff along the inside midway around the far turn, shifted out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. THE BEST DISTANCE
showed the way around the first turn to set the pace in the three path down the backstretch, but lost the lead while just off the rail approaching the quarter,
and faded in the three path down the lane. BRYCE CANYON raced wellback along the inside and made no impact. PEJA DU rated in the two path but did
not threaten from the five path in the stretch. RACE CRAFT trailed in the three path and never menaced.

Footnotes
PALACE ZIP rated in the three path, was cued while five wide midway around the far turn, took the lead while floating out to the seven path at the top of the
lane and inched ahead of an inner pair. REINA MAR chased in the four path, bid midway around the far turn, and ran on from the five path in the stretch for
place. MI AMORE tracked in the three path, took the lead while under a ride midway around the far turn, lost the lead entering the stretch but kept on for
show. MELODY'S KISS bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback along the inside, was driven in the three path around the far turn, angled out
to the seven path in upper stretch, but made no impact. MADONNINA prompted the pace in the three path but retreated around the far turn. MISS
TARISANSOL bumped with an outer foe at the start, then checked along the inside early around the first turn, raced off the pace in the four path and did not
threaten from the seven path in the stretch. UPTOWN CAT stalked in the two path but backed up around the far turn. KHOZANKA set the pace inside but
gaveway midway around the far turn.
