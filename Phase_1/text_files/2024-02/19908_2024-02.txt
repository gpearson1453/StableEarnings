Footnotes
GABAGOOL set the pace in the three path, was nudged along while just off the rail early around the turn, tipped back out to the three path at the top of the
lane, and dug in to just hold off an outer foe. MACLIN bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the five path, was driven in the four path around the
turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, and ran on but just missed to settle with place. LAST SHIFT chased in the two path, tipped to the rail around
the turn, was cued turning into the lane, and kept on for show. BERNARDO'S LEGACY stalked in the four path, was ridden between foes in the three path
around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the stretch but was one paced. IMAGE OF CURLIN broke out at the start, trailed along the rail and made
no impact. WHADDYA MEAN bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed in the five path, bid two wide going into the turn, floated out to the four path
entering the lane, but faded. WHISKEY AND WINE rated in the three path but was no menace.

GRIDLOCK was a bit reluctant to load, settled in range three wide, closed outside, brushed with SIPHON CITY GIRL leaving the sixteenth pole and was up
late. SIPHON CITY GIRL set the pace in the two path, brushed with the winner leaving the sixteenth pole and yielded in deep stretch. INABLINK raced off
the pace three wide and ran on for the show. RED HOT SPARK chased the pace from the rail and faded in the lane. LADY MONIQUE trailed inside, angled
out in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. BINGO'S DREAM pressed the pace in the three path and tired in the lane. KHOZANKA chased the pace two
wide and lacked a closing bid.

SONG ON THE RADIO rated up close in the three path, took over early on the backstretch, set the the pace in the two path around the far turn, drifted out in
the stretch and lasted. FLAT TOP BOX saved ground in range early, advanced three wide around the far turn, rallied outside and just missed. PARTY WITH
SMARTY led inside early, chased the winner inside around the far turn and kept on well to hold the show. FOR THE CHIEF raced in range three wide and
was one-paced through the lane. DARING REASON was reluctant to load, raced two wide and never threatened. ADIOS PAPA CHICO was outrun inside.

the far turn, but lost the lead nearing the quarter, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and finished evenly for show. SWEET SENSATION bumped
with an outer foe and got pinched at the start, was unhurried while tipping out to the five path turning into the backstretch, but made no impact from the

in the stretch. SHE'S SO BEARRISH laid up close in the three path turning into the backstretch, but was steadied midway around the far turn, and faded.

Footnotes
TAPIT THREE TIMES showed the way around the first turn to set an open pace in the three path down the backstretch, was roused along the inside
passing the quarter, dug in while tipping back out to the three path in upper stretch, but drifted out under left handed encouragement around the sixteenth
bumping an outer foe, and held on. HOT N LUCKY stalked in the four path, loomed two wide approaching the quarter, bid from the four path into the stretch,
ran on to head the inner pacesetter passing the eighth pole, but got bumped by that foe around the sixteenth and was repelled to place. ECHO LANE rated
in the four path, was roused from the three path into the far turn, swung out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. ROAN tracked in the
two path, was cued from the rail midway around the far turn, but flattened around the three path in the stretch. SUMMER STORM STRIC was unhurried in
the three path turning into the backstretch, tipped out to the five path under a drive turning into the lane, but failed to bid. SANPIRODU raced off the pace in
the three path but never threatened. KHOPESH trailed throughout. AFTER A STEWARDS INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE
RIDER OF HOT N LUCKY AGAINST THE RIDER OF TAPIT THREE TIMES FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, TAPIT THREE TIMES
WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT AND BUMPING HOT N LUCKY AROUND THE SIXTEENTH POLE,
COSTING HIM A FAIR CHANCE TO GET BY.
