Footnotes
MIGHTY MESSAGE raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the final turn, made a wide bid and was going away at the end.
GARFISH went to the front, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. SLEW SKIES pressed the pace, raced
close throughout and proved no match for the top two. LEGENDARY DRAGON raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid, but was no real factor.
SPECIAL STORMY lacked early speed and passed tired ones. DONEGAL DREAMER void of early speed, moved up and finished evenly. HE'S ALL EARS
challenged for the early advantage and faded. WHATDIDWEDO lacked early speed and was never a threat. PUT IT BACK DAVE hesitated at the start and
was never close. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS void of early speed and showed little.

Footnotes
FLOWER CAT pressed the pace, took the lead around the turn, pulled away and proved the best. ASTROLOGYSPROTEGE vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. BET AGAIN lacked early speed, made a late rail bid and proved no match
for the top two. RISKTAKER pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick. LION HEART LEGEND dueled on the front end, faded
and was no threat late. SEEHOSS raced near the middle of the field in the beginning, eased back, improved position late, but was no factor. SON CARLOS
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn and was never close. HEARTTHROB HALO void of early speed and showed little. CPRIORITY always
raced near the back and was outrun. ROCK SOLID WORDS broke through the gates, raced in the middle of the pack in the early part and dropped back.
