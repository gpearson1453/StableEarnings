Footnotes
BUFF'S EYE VIEW settled in the three path the first turn then started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took the lead two deep midway on the far turn,
dug in under steady stretch encouragement and just lasted; all out. BLAMEITONTHEFUN stalked off the rail into the first turn then took the nod into the
backstretch and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the five sixteenths pole, was met at the rail midway on the far turn, eased out later yards,
came again and just missed. NO FOOLING DUDE rated a short lead inside, was met into the backstretch and gave chase from that point, raced at the rail
on the far turn and showed little more. MAGNETRON rounded the opening turn about the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced two
deep on the far turn and weakened into the lane. MAKE WAY raced in the three path the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response.

DELIGHTFUL BREEZE took a quick lead and rated the pace inside, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was
kept sharp in the lane. BAYLIS STREET chased and raced close off the rail on the turn, though, had to settle for second best. SHES SO SPEIGHTSY gave
chase, rounded the turn at the rail and dug in to take the nod for third under the wire. ALWAYS SOMETHING was shuffled back on the chute then gave
chase, but flattened in the four path on the turn. AWAY TO RETURN showed little effort while racing outside.

Footnotes
OVERNIGHT POW WOW came away slowly then picked up the chase inside, lacked room leaving the five sixteenths pole and raced boxed at the rail
through the turn, took the lead passing the eighth pole and proved best with a hand ride through the lane. MARGARITA SUNSET set a pressured early
pace, was met at the five sixteenths pole but contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, drifted and was met leaving the eighth pole and had to settle
for second. MY LUCKY DEIA gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path and ran evenly in the lane. FAR MORE gave chase, raced in the four path
on the turn, left the turn outside and ran evenly in the lane. BULL'S LEGACY chased, rounded the turn near the rail and showed little in the lane. TRUE
BUCKPASSING pressured the pace and drew to even terms at the five sixteenths pole, raced close through the turn but dropped back while losing ground
toward the head of the lane and weakened. BLUSHING BIP BOP never factored racing outside.

LA MACCHINA ROSSA settled close in the four and five paths the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep toward
the head of the lane, dug in to clear PASS THE CASH passing the sixteenth pole and held on well. The latter rated a slim early lead inside, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole and was met toward the head of the lane, remained a factor to mid-stretch but relented the final sixteenth.
UNMATCHED rated close inside on the first turn, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, eased outward leaving
the turn and ran evenly in the lane. HONORS LEGACY settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the three path, drifted leaving the turn and ran evenly in the stretch. DEE DEE SIX rounded the opening turn about the three path, picked up the
chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and showed little in the lane. COLLECTED SUCCESS settled off the rail the
first turn eased out and gave chase into the backstretch, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little further. T C NEIGH raced off the rail on
the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened at the rail on the far turn. RAGAZZA MIA came away a bit rank and raced in the four
path the first turn, showed little response through the backstretch then saved ground on the far turn. NOBLE OBSESSION stalked off the rail the first turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded from the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
LION OF THE SEA dueled for the early lead and set a pressured pace from the three eighths pole, drew clear midway on the turn and was steadily handled
to just last. GRAND ESCAPE pressured the pace two deep while between horses, entered the turn at the rail, drifted outward under left hand urging through
the stretch and just missed in a strong finish. GRAND FIBER gave chase through the backstretch but lacked room off the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the
turn and finished well to take third the final strides. LOADED SNIPER gave chase through the backstretch and raced in range of the lead in the three path
on the turn, but was forced outward through the lane and flattened later yards. TOO BAD JUSTICE gave chase, entered the turn off the rail but was eased
outward through the turn, left the turn outside and passed some rivals. PROTA chased, rounded the turn off the rail, eased out entering the stretch then
flattened stride later yards. HINK'S PALADIN gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and weakened in the lane. STRETCH THE TRUTH pressured
the early pace but dropped back at the rail approaching the quarter pole and faded through the turn. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider
of Grand Escape for interference through the stretch, lodged by the rider of Loaded Sniper, and as a result, disqualified the former to fourth place.

Footnotes
YOUTHFUL ENERGY gave chase and raced in range of the lead in the three path on the turn, dug in leaving the turn and got up the final yards. WHALE OF
A RUN set a pressured pace and contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in under steady stretch encouragement but was caught in the final
yards. RAISE A RUCKUS gave chase, raced close two deep on the turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and flattened later yards. SEATTLE PRINCE
gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and showed little in the lane. RIDE THE BRAND gave close early chase inside but checked at the rail past the
five sixteenths pole and faded through the turn. DEFIANT GIANT gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail and passed some rivals in the lane. RESTLESS
BUSTER and MANHATTAN IMAGE mostly saved ground.
