Footnotes
OUR HEATSEEKER broke outwardly, led from an inner prompter early on, drew clear with a half mile to go, widened in the two path around the far turn and
was driven home to seal the deal. BIG TAP BABY brushed with an outer rival at the start, prompted inside of the eventual winner around the first turn, failed
to sustain pressure after a half mile, chased while vying for place with an outer foe around the far turn, drew away from that one entering the lane and was
second best. QUEENIE'S LEROY brushed with an inner foe at the start, stalked in the three path, chased while vying for place around the far turn, but tired
whlie in upper stretch hanging on his left lead. RENATI pursued from midpack in the four to five path and lacked a bid. MINE YOUR BIZ raced at the rear in
the five path and made little impact. LORD HELP ME broke a bit awkwardly and a step slow, lacked speed in the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
LIL TOWN SIS stalked the top pair from the two to three path around the turn, bid outside of the new leader in upper stretch, sparred with that one through
the final furlong and edged ahead late. MISSILE prompted two wide, gained an advantage entering the lane before meeting an outer challenge in upper
stretch, shifted in while sparring at the furlong grounds, then came back out sustaining the duel but no making contact with his outer counterpart entering the
final sixteenth and got bested. CASBY chased along the inside, vacated the rail passing the three sixteenths pole, bid for show along with an outer rival
entering the final sixteenth and held. CHROME RACER tracked two wide, was urged in pursuit around the turn, floated to the four path in upper stretch, bid
for show along with an inner foe in the final furlong but missed. TRIBEST (ARG) set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure, got headed by that one
entering the lane and weakened. MYSTIC CREED was pulled up in distress down the backstretch and got vanned off.

Footnotes
BRENNAN'S HONOR was bumped and bothered by an outer rival at the start, tracked from midpack two wide, then between foes around the far turn,
smoothly split the leaders to offer a bid entering the lane, wrestled an advantage in upper stretch and held sway. ROUSSETTE stalked two to three wide
and between horses early on, fanned to the five path and outside of the main flight turning for home, ran on within striking range of the new leader into
midstretch, gained place and took aim entering the final sixteenth but needed more. BRIE'S MISSION was slow into stride and lacked speed along the
inside, picked up stride before waiting behind rivals in the two to three path turning for home, moved between horses entering upper stretch, chased before
altering course outside of rivals at the sixteenth pole and stayed on willingly to reach show late. EXEMPTION vied for the lead along the inside, led around
the far turn, but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and gradually yielded. THIS TIME BLUE brushed with an outer rival at the start, laid off of
the pace along the inside, took closer order before tracking from the pocket around the far turn, but lacked a bid and faded. THEPLAINS MARSHALL leaned
in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked in the four path, moved forward to press the pace at the half mile pole, sustained pressure outside of the leader
around the far turn, but weakened entering the lane. STORM FORCE brushed with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide and was outrun.
HOWARD'S GRIT bobbled slightly upon leaving the gates, showed the way three to two wide around the first turn, but weakened between horses at the half
mile pole and readily stopped.

Footnotes
PLATINUM MINIT stalked along the inside, tipped to take aim outside of the top pair nearing the lane, attempted a bid in upper stretch, but failed to gain
even terms while drifting outwardly in the final furlong, straightened late and edged past the leader in the shadow of the wire. CLEARLY A TEST pressed the
leader from the three path, vied with that one from the two path around the far turn, wrestled an advantage passing the quarter pole, dug in as an outer
bidder menaced in upper stretch, held sway from that drifting pursuer into the final sixteenth, but got nailed at the wire. FRONT AND SILVER laid off of the
pace in the three path, was roused to inch closer around the far turn before being fanned to the four path turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the
top pair while chasing entering the lane, kept on to reach show in the final sixteenth and lasted for that position. SAVED BY GRACE was bumped by an
inner rival upon leaving the gate and was slow into stride soon after, trailed in the two to three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane, moved up and
missed reaching show. SHE SMILED AT ME showed the way as an outer rival applied mild pressure, vied with that bidder around the far turn, but was
headed leaving the quarter pole and weakened. SACRED SAINT bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide while a bit keen into and around the
first turn, pursued between horses around the far turn, but faded turning for home.

ROCKETS SISTER dueled for the lead in the three path while between a pair of foes into the turn, led in the four path entering the lane and drove clear. DE'
ANS EIGHTY leaned out slightly at the start, tracked three wide, swung to the six path entering the lane and offered a grinding charge to edge place in the
late stags. FAST LANI sparred for the lead with a pair of outer rivals while a path off of the inside around the turn, but proved no match for her most
immediate counterpart entering the lane, gave way and lost place late. DULCIA chased two wide and between horses while under urging into the turn,
yielded turning for home, yet came again to improve position inside of rivals. FIRING BULLETS trailed in the three to four path, fanned to the seven path in
upper stretch and moved up. CATSKILL HUMOR took back from tight quarters between rivals at the start, stalked close up along the inside, shifted out to
the four path entering upper stretch, but lacked a bid before leaning out in midstretch, and faded. WILD ACCLAIM vied for the lead with an inner pair of
rivals while in the four path, gave way in the five path entering the lane and weakened between horses.

JACK HAMMER dictated terms with a loose advantage, widened under a drive in upper stretch and was geared down entering the final sixteenth. BUDRO
TALKING trailed two wide, launched an advance between horses nearing the lane, sustained a rally along with an outer rival to gain place at the sixteenth
pole. BLUE CHEESE laid off of the pace in the four path and stayed on willingly along with an inner foe. HIGHLAND CREEK stalked in the two path, but
gave way in upper stretch and faded on his left lead. BENOIT tracked in the two to three path, but began to fade into the far turn and weakened between
horses turning for home. WICKED ROSE laid off of the pace along the inside and made little impact.

BROOKLYNN DREW showed the way in the two path, drew off entering the lane and widened under little urging. HELEN'S LITTLE SIS chased along the
inside into the turn, pursued shifting from the two to four path turning for home, gained place after the leader kicked away in upper stretch and was second
best. CANDY LOVER chased from midpack in the three path, shifted to the five path in upper stretch and ran on mildly to reach show at the wire. LUCY
GOT GAME tracked along the inside, offered a rail chase to gain show leaving the three sixteenths pole but was caught by an outer foe at the wire. HATTIE
BLOOM was brushed by an inner rival at the start, trailed in the two path, shifted out entering midstretch and moved up. SYBARITE pressed the leader from
the three path, yielded entering the lane and weakened between horses. PROBLEMATICA stuttered a step and brushed an outer rival at the start, lacked
speed in the four path, drifted inwardly in midstretch while hanging on her left lead and tired.

Footnotes
ELLIE'S BOYFRIEND showed the way along the inside, drew clear in upper stretch and held sway while hanging on his left lead. COOKN WIT CATMAN
stalked three wide, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, chased that clearing rival in upper stretch and kept on to prove second best.
GARNET JUBILEE hopped and was off slow, laid off of the pace along the inside, split foes two wide entering the lane, shifted to the five path in upper
stretch and ran on willingly. NONCHALANT lacked speed in the four to two path and moved up coming to midstretch. DROMAS laid off of the pace in the
five to six path and lacked a rally. ENGLISH BOBBY stalked along the inside, chased turning for home and gave way. GREY'S RUMOR broke a step slow,
trailed along the inside before swinging out nearing the lane, but made little impact. HANGMAN CREEK pressed two wide and between horses but
weakened around the turn. THREE POINT STRUT tracked in the three to four path and tired between horses in upper stretch.
