Footnotes
ASSUME NOTHING got away alertly and was quickly clear, shifted in setting the pace, was shadowed by an outside foe, shook clear in upper stretch,
drifted out through mid- to late-stretch while being kept busy and held sway. ENERGY EFFICIENT pursued from mid-pack initially between foes then going
three then four wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch to secure place while no match for the winner. ORDER OFTHE KETTLE settled at the rear racing off
the inside, advanced outside foes three to four wide on the turn, came into upper stretch, got show honors. MARGIE'S FUN SON switched outside the
leader and eventual winner, pressed that one into and on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. WICKED SECRET chased from outside off the pace, went
two to three wide on the turn ridden along about the seven-sixteenths, failed to rally. I KNOW raced a bit keen in the very early going moving up inside,
continued to chase from inside dropping back to last, switched out leaving the turn entering the stretch six wide, was not a late threat. MOSLER TIME
stumbled badly at the start losing the rider, walked off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
TUBTIMSIAM settled just off the pace racing up close outside about four wide, moved to challenge coming to the quarter pole, took charge, drew away in
the stretch. MY ENDEAVOR was caught three to four wide outside foes early, shifted nearer the inside advancing to within range of the leaders on the far
turn, angled out passing the quarter pole within range, could not kick on with the winner but was second best. SEEKER brushed lightly with inside and
outside foes at the start, set the pace racing well off the rail moving clear in the three path on the first turn, dictated terms up the backstretch, was overtaken
past the quarter pole, moved out in late stretch and failed to rally. OLUDENIZ was caught four to five wide outside foes through the first turn, was a bit
nearer the inside still far off the leaders into the far turn, improved position into upper stretch. HOW U DOIN brushed lightly at the start, chased from inside,
steadily weakened. MINIMO bumped with a rival after the start, saved ground on the first turn, continued just off the rail, failed to menace. GO TINTIN GO
broke awkwardly then bumped with rivals a few strides after, was in tight and shuffled back at that point, settled to bring up the rear inside, moved out on the
far turn, was never near enough to threaten. TIK TOK DADDY bumped the inside rival just after the start, tucked in two wide entering the first turn in behind
the leaders just off those, moved out for the far turn dropping back outside foes on that bend, pulled up near the sixteenth pole and walked off.

KINGDOM FORCE was brushed just lightly at the start, raced close up tracking in behind and off the fence into the turn, sought room between foes three
wide coming to the quarter pole, had clear-sailing by mid-stretch and kept on under steady handling to edge past late. DANCE FOR GREEN shadowed the
pacesetter into the turn racing two to three wide, bid past the three-eighths, appeared in command by the top of the stretch but was outkicked.
ASCENDANCE was unhurried early, came into upper stretch six wide and improved. BIGDADDYSBOY was never far back stalking from outside, advanced
three to four wide on the turn while urged along by the five-sixteenths, evened out in the stretch. RUBYS FLASH brushed a rival just lightly at the start, was
urged forward and set the pace inside hounded by a foe, overtaken by the top of the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN CARDO settled outside at the rear, went four to five wide on the turn coming six wide to the top of the stretch with aim, gained steadily through
the stretch taking the lead about the sixteenth pole and kicked clear. ROYAL SPY got away alertly, set the pace from off the rail with some inside pressure,
was in command and clear in upper stretch but outkicked and second best. REMEMBERING WILBUR broke a bit awkwardly and was brushed lightly,
settled off the pace racing two to three wide into the turn, moved out five wide in upper stretch, brushed a rival a couple times and fought on to improve.
AIN'T WASTING TIME was strongly urged from the start, pressed from between then inside, kept on under stout and steady urging in the stretch but
needed more. EDDIE THE GREAT was up close chasing three to four wide, weakened. ANTIPOISON brushed a rival lightly at the start, settled off the pace,
moved out four wide coming to the quarter pole, was forced out wider in the stretch while bumped and in tight late. BONDED raced well back and off the
inside and was never a threat.

Footnotes
SMOOTH RICO bumped the inside foe at the start, stalked the leading pair from outside, moved three to four wide and bid at the top of the stretch quickly
moving clear while lugging in, extended the advantage late under steady handling. IRISH WARLOCK stalked just off and in behind the leader, advanced
four to five wide on the turn, was no match for the winner but second best. SUSTENANCE was urged forward and vied inside a foe on or just off the rail,
continued to chase in behind through the turn into upper stretch, drifted a bit in the lane and had no extra. ABUELO PAPS bumped a rival while bobbling at
the start, was caught outside five to six wide on the turn into upper stretch but kept on to improve position. GREAT DAYS AHEAD chased from inside
mid-division, went evenly. RASCALLY REBEL was ridden along early racing inside, came out near the sixteenth pole finishing with mild late interest.
SPONSORED bumped a rival and was in tight at the start, ridden along racing off the rail, came out a bit for the drive then altered inside a rival near the
sixteenth pole and passed foes. LUV YA BYE BYE was bumped at the break, had brief early speed, dropped back but not too far off the leaders, went three
to four wide on the turn, flattened out for the drive. ICE COLD FROSTY was ridden along outside a foe toward the back two to three deep, swung seven
wide into upper stretch and was never near enough to threaten. LANDON JACK was bumped on both sides at the start, attended the pace from outside two
to three wide then took charge after the opening quarter with a narrow advantage through the turn, faltered and faded. ROCKLAND EXPRESS broke
outwardly several paths, was not a factor.

Footnotes
MISS HARRIETT was quick to lead and shifted in, set the pace near the inside shadowed by foes, kicked away again turning into upper stretch and held
sway. DETERMINED DRIVER advanced inside heading into the turn, shifted out three wide nearing the quarter pole, had aim on the leader and eventual
winner, ground on steadily but was second best. ROANAN GODDESS was wrangled back off the pace to stalk three to four wide, edged nearer coming to
the top of the stretch but evened out for the drive while shifting in a bit late. PERFECTLY WICKED broke a step slowly, brought up the rear lacking early
speed, swung out four wide for the drive, needed more. SHAMANS GIRL chased in behind and off the inside of the track, needed more late.
KISSEDBYANANGEL was given mild encouragement at the start then keenly moved forward between runners, pressed the early pace of the eventual
winner, faltered.

Footnotes
SPEEDYNESS attended the pace inside a foe on or just off the rail, took a narrow advantage heading into the turn, kicked just clear in the stretch and held
sway. POINT DUME was well-placed stalking into the turn racing three to four wide, bid coming to the quarter pole coming nearly even with the eventual
winner but could not sustain the effort but maintained the place. CIRCLE P lacked early speed, fanned six wide into upper stretch and brushed lightly at that
juncture, ran on. STARTSWITHADREAM chased in behind near the rail, ran on in the stretch but needed more. SWEET SODDY J prompted the pace from
outside the eventual winner two to three wide, weakened. REGALO chased mid-pack two to three wide outside a foe into the turn, shifted five wide at the
top of the stretch brushing with a rival lightly, needed more late. COOL IN BLUE trailed and was not a threat.

Footnotes
PORCH SWING stumbled fairly badly at the start bumping a rival in the process, settled off the pace, bid up the rail in upper- to mid-stretch exchanging a
bump with a rival near the furlong grounds, kicked clear. TRASH TALKIN LARRY had the early lead briefly then attended then stalked from outside, raced
three to four wide on the turn, lugged in a bit in upper- to mid-stretch, was outkicked. VERBIER settled at the rear, advanced while shifting out from three to
five wide coming to the quarter pole with aim on the leaders, evened out in the drive. HIPPODROME attended the early pace inside under a tight hold, took
a narrow lead into the turn, saved ground on that bend, floated out a path turning for home, was forced in a bit nearing the eighth pole bumping with an
inside rival, weakened. PRACTICAL SENSE was bumped at the start, coaxed forward between runners to a narrow lead, was overtaken by the inside rival,
re-bid drawing even with that one three furlongs out, weakened in the stretch. MY MAMBA tossed the head slightly at the start while breaking outwardly,
was outsprinted early, raced close up in behind and off the inside coming to the top of the stretch, failed to rally.
