Footnotes
SHE HIT A HOMER broke a bit awkwardly, settled off the pace outside, advanced four then five then six wide on the turn, engaged the leader in mid-stretch,
took the lead by the sixteenth pole, edged past under steady urging. ROCKIN MARIE moved quickly to the lead, set the pace from off the rail in about the
three path, drifted five wide turning for home, was collared a sixteenth out and second best. ANNA B chased from inside on or just off the rail, floated four
wide leaving the turn, kept on to secure show honors. WAY RITE appeared to be getting out a bit in the early going, went three to five wide on the turn in
range, moved out seven to eight deep for the stretch run, kept on late. IT'S SAUL RIGHT was in tight early, saved ground inside, asked for more at the
quarter pole but failed to rally. BLUEBERRY EYES was outsprinted early, went two to three wide on the turn, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
JUVAL settled mid-division racing wide, came out six deep turning for home, took aim, surged late to prevail. DOM WAYNE set the pace from off the rail,
drifted out a bit leaving the far turn, shook clear in upper stretch, was caught inside the final sixteenth. BURNZ DA BOSS was strongly urged at the start,
had forward position stalking the leader from outside, was kept about four to five deep, took closer order three furlongs out pressing the runner-up, kept on
in the stretch but needed more. REVOLT AND RIOT was off the inside in about the two to four path throughout, went evenly. RAISEBEFORETHEFLOP
chased from off the rail, came out in the stretch, failed to rally. SIERRA SUMMER moved out wide on the first turn, advanced outside eight to nine deep up
the backstretch moving nearer the inside in pursuit of the leaders into the turn, floated seven wide into upper stretch, weakened. WILLTOBELUCKY was
fractious in the gate and never a threat racing off the inside.

Footnotes
DINI DICE moved forward to the lead after the opening three-sixteenths, set the pace off the rail, kicked clear in upper stretch, lasted. YO SOY ROY
bumped a rival lightly at the start, was guided out in the early going, kept wide into the turn and trailing, swung ten deep into upper stretch, was gaining fast
late but missed. GOING TO SANANTONE had the early lead but ceded it to the eventual winner, stalked that rival, was encouraged a bit three furlongs out,
floated about five wide into upper stretch, lacked the needed late kick. ANGEL'S SHADOWS raced off the inside part of the track, kept on in the stretch.
YOUNG POPE was hard to load then away slowly, advanced early to pursue the leaders five to six wide on the turn, needed more. RED FROST was
bumped lightly at the start, chased from near the inside, came out, failed to menace. SUENO REAL broke outwardly, moved out from four to seven wide
leaving the turn, needed more.

a bit in upper stretch, forged clear. FOXY RED fanned ten wide into upper stretch, was second best. ANDREABANANAS broke a step slowly, fanned seven
wide into upper stretch, kept on to get up for show. PRETTY PEPPY moved forward inside, soon led, set the pace, was pressured on the turn, weakened.
NO BULL DARWIN stalked then moved nearer the leader to press the issue by the midpoint of the turn, bid coming past the quarter pole, drifted five wide
into upper stretch with the lead, flattened out. STORMY DAME chased the pacesetter, dropped back and faded.

vied from between runners four to five wide on the turn, kept on in the stretch, was second best. DECK HUMOR was prominent between runners three to
four wide, bumped the inside rival in upper stretch twice, kept on but needed more. WISKEY CROWN chased from between then inside but off the rail
racing mostly two to three wide, was bumped twice in upper stretch, weakened. MICKEYS GOLD lacked early speed racing outside at the back, came out
six wide in upper stretch, was not a threat. HOLLYWOOD TIZ broke a step slowly, was never a threat. BLACK EYED BANDIT showed brief speed inside,
dropped back and faded.

outkicked. HIT BTWEEN THE ICE chased racing mostly three to five wide and just off the pace, kept on late. SEEULATERGATOR stalked the winner, bid
outside while getting floated seven wide leaving the turn, was outkicked. REINING PESOS chased from inside, came out in the stretch, failed to menace.
BRAZEN NOW was forced in bumping a rival at the start, swung eight deep, was not a threat. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START

Footnotes
SNOW BOOTS settled off the pace, came out seven wide for the drive and flew past late. JUANA RUMBLE moved in tandem with and outside a rival six
then five wide on the turn to press the leader, drifted in a bit in mid- to late-stretch while making a bid, was outkicked. G G HENNESSY made a swift move
five then four wide early on the turn to take the lead pressed by an outside foe throughout, drifted in a bit in the stretch, was outkicked. I'M A DREAMER
TOO was bumped at the start but still forwardly-placed two to three wide, was carried in a bit in mid-stretch, altered outside runners in late stretch and kept
on. EMPERIAL EAGLES bumped a rival at the start, was mostly three to four wide, improved. SHUG'S ROCKET was forwardly-positioned inside, in a bit
tight on the rail in mid-stretch and had to alter out. TAZ MARKING was urged at the start, had brief early speed, dropped back three wide shifting out six
deep on the turn, came out further to be ten wide in upper stretch, ran on. AL GRANO D ORO was prominent early racing four to five deep, floated eight to
nine wide turning for home, tired. BULLDACIOUS KROME was not a threat racing near the inside. JAZZY RED swung eleven deep turning for home, was
never a threat.
