Footnotes
HEY JOE JOE raced off the early pace outside, advanced and challenged three wide in the turn, put a head in front entering the stretch, drifted in slightly
under a right handed crop inside the furlong marker, kicked clear late. NOTORIOUS SIXOHTWO broke alertly, set the pace up the backstretch, dropped to
the inside to show the way through the turn, responded when challenged turn, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late. GO OTTO GO pressed the runner
up from the outside the opening quarter, moved up to vied between the top pair through the turn and into the stretch, appeared to be weakening from
between that pair when in a bit tight with just over a sixteenth remaining, continued falter in the waning strides, comfortably saved the show. WALDRIP last
to leave, second flight while four wide into the turn, came three wide into the stretch, improved a bit while not a threat to the top three. SUPER RENZO
forwardly placed early in the two path, fell back before a half then went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing response. LEMON MERINGUE in the
second group off the inside, three wide early turn, two path exiting, lacked a closing kick. BYE BYE LIAM raced briefly forward along the rail, shuffled back
into the turn, trailed home. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF GO OTTO GO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP
STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

DIRTY FLIRT outrun early while off the inside, three wide into the far turn, began to advance soon after, knifed out five wide and between horses turning for
home, challenged a furlong out, dueled to the wire, gained nod. BLUE EMBER tracked the pace while toward the inside, followed the first flight into the far
turn, steered out four to five wide into the stretch, took over upper stretch, responded when the winner came alongside nearing the furlong grounds, dug in
and proved stubborn to the end. BUMP IN THE NIGHT lacked speed, carried out six wide turning for home, staged a mild rally to annex the show. MONEY
IS TIME off a step slow, raced back, three wide into the lane when beginning to advance, mildly to miss the show. CRY IF I WANT TO in mid pack while
racing off the inside, two path, traffic turning for home, went evenly to the wire. FASHION IDOL four wide into the first turn, continued outside, challenged
three wide in the second turn then weakened in the drive. CATTY CRUISE vied up front while between horses, faltered final furlong. BODI ODI pressed the
issue up front three wide, put a head in front between horse mid way on the second turn then gave way when headed into the stretch. MISS ANALYZED in
mid pack and inside, had little for the drive. INTRUSION off a step slow, raced back and four wide through the first turn, never involved. BABE IN THE
WOODS away well, set or forced the pace four five furlongs along the inside, stopped.

Footnotes
LOVE OF MY HEART outrun in the early going, steered out four wide late in the turn, floated out a bit further into the lane, rallied down the middle of the
strip to win going away under steady handling. SHE'S BULLETPROOF behind the first flight while saving ground through the turn, angled four wide into the
lane inside the winner floating that rival out a bit, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, determined to be up for the place late. FOREVER
HOME forwardly placed for a half along the inside, challenged for the second spot after the winner had gained command past the furlong marker, outkicked
late for that position. BUG A BOO broke outward and slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, continued to lag, came three wide for the drive, staged a
mild, belated rally to improve position. MIA BABY pressed the leader off the inside, had little left for the stretch run. MUSICMANSANDY broke on top, set the
pace along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner nearing midstretch. LAMASCO broke back, made little impact in the two path. Z ZS RED

Footnotes
SALSALITA VERDE within striking distance, closer three wide into the far turn, dueled, kicked well clear through the stretch under steady handling.
CASHMERE BABY off a step slow, asked along off the inside second turn, angled out four wide for the drive, finished willingly to be clearly second best, not
a threat to the winner. DR. WOODS MIRACLE devoid of speed while racing toward the inside, moved out, four wide second turn, rallied on the outside into
the lane, in time for the show. DOMINA within striking distance while inside early, two path second turn, came up empty for the stretch run. GLOBAL RISK
chased the early leader off the inside, inherited the advantage when that foe stopped into the far turn, briefly dueled with the winner through the final bend
then gave way. PADDY GAL settled off the pace and the inside, continued three wide through the second turn, continued one paced to the wire in lacking a
closing response. SCANDALOUS in mid pack and four wide into and through the first turn, four then three wide through the seconds bend, had nothing for
the drive. RED SUNSHINE remained back in failing to menace. BABAS GAL in mid pack early, began a steady fade after a half. COWGIRL CAMILLE broke
on top, set the pace inside, stopped, distanced after losing contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
FIGHTERTOWN broke on top, quickly cleared, set all the pace toward the inside, shook off mild bid upper, drew off, ridden out. CHELSEA DAGGER
allowed the pace to go early, moved closer while saving ground through the second turn, proved no match for the winner in the drive, clear of the rest.
VINCENZINO closest to the winner off the inside, continued to chase the middle half mile, had little for that one in the drive nor could contain the runner up,
safely saved the show. I'M CRENSHAW void of speed off the inside, three wide through the second turn, displayed a mild amount of late interest to better
position a bit. ASPEN CLUB lacked speed while four wide in the first turn, made a mild advance four to three wide second turn, flattened out in the drive.
HALLOW POINT devoid of any early foot, moved out three wide second turn, also improved position with some modest late energy, no real threat. RED
DEVIL went one paced toward the inside in lacking a rally. MAJOR CONTENDER four wide through the first turn when within striking distance, three wide
and still within contact of the winner in the far turn, began to tire soon after. FETCHS BRAHM broke through the gate prior to the start, began a steady fade
before a half. JIM AND JIM last away, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
BRILLIANT MAN in mid pack early, moved up to stalk the pace three wide the middle half mile, challenged three wide and on the outside turning for home,
extended duel to the wire, proved best under firm handling. TOP OF THE STREET prompted the leader from the outside for six furlongs, challenged inside
the winner and between horses into the stretch, dueled to the wire, proved stubborn to the end. J J'S RANGER broke out, settled off the pace toward the
inside, came in the two path for the drive, along for the show while not a threat to the top pair. PATRIOT HILLS broke on top, set the pace while along the
inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, gave way when headed. TIS CHARMING bobbled at the start, recovered to track the pace inside, continued to
save ground second turn, had little for the drive. SILVER TONE pushed out at the break, moved outside into the first turn, four wide around that turn,
continued four wide and failed to rally. MIRAGE dropped inside first turn, saved ground to no avail. REVELATION pinched back at the start, raced in mid
pack between horses early, continued off the inside, lost action second turn when appearing to go bad, pulled up, vanned off.

Footnotes
NEVER SWAY forwardly placed early inside, moved outside the leader when prompting that one into the turn, challenged late in that bend, took over, kicked
clear. DIXIE PENNY in the second flight on the outside, continued to race three wide through the turn, no match for the winner in the drive, held sway for the
second spot late. ROYAL MEGHAN in the second group while between horses into the turn, moved inside, slowly gaining on the runner up late. CHASING
SHADOWS hesitated at the start to be away slowly, continued back through the turn, staged a mild rally to improve position. EQUILOVE (IRE) broke alertly,
soon sprinted clear, set the pace for a half along the inside, gave way when headed by the winner in upper stretch. NORTHERN DIAMOND behind the pace
inside early, moved out, three wide turning for home, failed to rally. IZEONPOINT hesitated at the break, trailed throughout to be always outrun.

Footnotes
BOW DRAW back off the pace and the inside, advanced three wide far turn, challenged midway on that bend, dueled into the stretch, put that rival away
inside the furlong grounds, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. XYLOPHONE void of speed for five furlongs, circled five wide into the stretch,
challenged outside the winner but was too late. MALIBU SMART lacked speed, raced off the inside, picked way through traffic in the three path second turn,
set down for the drive, finished willingly to be up for the show. RED RIVER MAGIC forwardly placed three wide first turn, continued to lay close up the
backstretch, advanced and challenged the leader on the outside far turn, dueled inside the winner into and through upper stretch, held stubbornly until late,
nailed for the show at the wire. WILDWOOD BYE off the pace while inside the winner early, steadied in traffic in the two path second turn, fell back then
improved position in the drive after recovering. LITTLE SISTER SUE in the main group early inside, steered out three wide around some traffic late in the
final turn, also improved a bit through the stretch. TWIN MISCHIEF void of early foot outside, advanced four wide through the second turn, failed to sustain
that advance through the stretch. WHAT'S TO DO off slowly, raced back and outside, five wide into the far turn, four wide entering the stretch, went flat
through the lane. FAITH ALONE settled in mid pack toward the inside, continued to save some ground into the far turn, checked up midway on that turn,
moved out three wide then passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. LADY JAE broke sharp, pressed the pace for five furlongs, in some traffic
late backstretch and began to give way. DELPHIA forwardly placed toward the inside, steadied repeatedly behind and among horses second turn, fell back
and lost all chance. WHISKEY LULLABY narrowly showed the way early, shook clear the second quarter, stopped second turn when headed.

Footnotes
SIR PEEL in some traffic early, dropped inside late backstretch, tracked through the turn, steered back outside, three wide into the stretch, kicked down the
leader while out in the strip to be up in time. DALTON'S RUTROW back off the pace while outside, four wide into the turn, challenged three wide around the
bend, shook clear into the lane, drifted out slightly, stubbornly. EIGHT STRAIGHT with the early pace, vied inside the runner up and between rivals through
the turn, fell back off the runner up into the stretch, dropped inside, rebid then gave ground grudgingly to the top two late. YOUNG JONESBORO in mid
pack while off the inside, three wide through the turn, displayed some mild late interest while not a threat to the top three. BOURBON ON FIRE back off the
early pace while saving some ground into the turn, two path into the stretch, improved slightly while also not posing a serious threat. FLYHERBFLYHIGH off
a step slow, raced back, moved inside midway on the turn, steadied in some traffic turning for home, improved after recovering. PREPAREDNESS off a step
slow, three wide into the stretch, passed a few tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. BRAHMS JR. remained back in failing to menace. CADILLAC
COWBOY flashed early speed along the inside, gave way just before a half. SECRET HONOR away in good order, prompted the issue up the backstretch,
in tight, shuffled back into the turn, four wide into the stretch, backed up through the stretch. MANSOURA checked up early in some traffic, remained back.
ALWAYS A KING in mid pack early, began a steady retreat before a half.
