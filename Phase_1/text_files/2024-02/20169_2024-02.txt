Footnotes
STEIN'S GIRL prominent away from the start, ceded the early lead and stalked BLOSSOMING into the first turn, kept close attendance to the modest pace
into the backstretch run, went up and pressed BLOSSOMING into the far turn, battled that rival into upper stretch and took command approaching the
furlong marker, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and drew clear to prevail. LIGHT UP broke out at the start and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried
in the early going and maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, was content to trail to the half-mile marker, roused two wide into the second turn,
swung four wide for the drive and loomed at mid-stretch, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and outfinished BLOSSOMING to
secure the place. BLOSSOMING sent away from the start, assumed early command and set modest fractions into the backstretch run, controlled the pace
to the half-mile marker, was pressed into the far turn by STEIN'S GIRL and battled with that rival into upper stretch, lost the lead at the furlong marker and
chased into the final sixteenth, could not keep pace with the winner into deep stretch and was outfinished for place honors in the final strides, while holding
safely for the show. RHONDA'S COOKIN tracked the early pace while between runners into the first turn, was well placed nearing the half-mile marker and
raced two to three wide into the far turn, raced a bit in traffic into upper stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, re-rallied in the final sixteenth but was
unable to catch the top three. ROSES R BLUE was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn and maintained
an outside path into the backstretch run, was well placed at the half-mile marker and chased three wide into the far turn, lost a bit of ground at mid-stretch
and did not offer a late response. HAPPY IS was forwardly placed away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and tracked the early pace into the
backstretch run, was well placed at the half-mile marker and saved all of the ground into the second turn, could not keep pace into the stretch and gave way
in the final furlong.

Footnotes
FEISTY ELLA never far back in the early stages, rated off of the decent pace and tracked outside of runners into the turn, improved position three wide at
the quarter marker, swung to the four path into the stretch and rallied approaching the furlong pole, was full of run past mid-stretch, overtook her stablemate
into the final sixteenth and drove clear to prevail. EXTREME BLAZE broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set decent fractions while prompted into
the turn, shook free along the bend and was well handled while showing the way to the quarter pole, kicked clear into the stretch and was kept to task past
the furlong grounds, was overtaken by her stablemate into the final sixteenth and held safely at the finish for second. STANDFORGRIT prominent away
from the start, came under a snug early hold and was hard to place while stalking from the inside, checked in tight quarters entering the turn and shifted to
the two path while in pursuit along the bend, lost ground while chasing into the stretch, weakened in the final sixteenth and held safely for show honors.
SHEZA QUEEN BEE lunged at the start and was off slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages and trailed into the turn, saved ground to the quarter
marker and maintained an inside path into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker, could not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and
flattened out. CALIGRAPHY tracked the decent early pace, improved position into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, was outrun into the
stretch and gave way in the final furlong.

Footnotes
DRAW SOME was hustled away from the start, vied for the early lead inside of a pair of rivals and assumed a narrow advantage approaching the half-mile
pole, set a pressured pace into the turn and carved out moderate fractions heading to the quarter marker, shook free from RANCHO RED into the stretch
and was kept to task past the furlong grounds, dug in while under pressure from RANCHO RED into the final sixteenth and determinedly held the runner-up
at bay in deep stretch to prevail. RANCHO RED broke in at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, was prominent away from the start and disputed the
early pace from between rivals, pressed the moderate pace two wide into the turn and kept close attendance to DRAW SOME at the quarter pole, lost
ground into the stretch and chased DRAW SOME to the furlong marker, responded to urging and re-bid into the final sixteenth, was held at bay by the
determined winner in deep stretch and bested the rest. COUNT ASHER broke out at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, tracked the moderate early
pace from the inside, was well placed into the turn and stalked the leading pair approaching the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch
and was outkicked at the furlong pole, battled with DANZ TILL TEN for show honors into the final sixteenth and won the nod for third on the wire. DANZ TILL
TEN was squeezed by neighboring rivals at the start and was away a bit slowly, tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, raced between
rivals and came in tight approaching the turn, found room along the bend and stalked two wide to the quarter pole, swung three wide for the drive and was
outkicked at mid-stretch, battled with COUNT ASHER for show honors into the final sixteenth and came up just short at the finish. FANTASTIC DREAM
away in good order, contested the early pace outside of a pair of rivals, took an awkward step approaching the half-mile marker and lost position on the run
into the turn, went three wide into the bend and was outrun to the quarter marker, lacked a response in the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SIGNORINA MERISI (GB) forwardly placed away from the start, took back and tracked from the second flight heading into the first turn, raced two wide into
the backstretch run and was well placed while behind horses approaching the half-mile marker, raced two wide into the far turn and came in a bit tight at the
quarter pole, tipped three wide into upper stretch and was roused for the drive, loomed at mid-stretch and took command past the furlong marker, was kept
to task into the final sixteenth and drew away under hand urging in the late stages. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL was prominent away from the start, ceded the
early lead to CALLHERCONTESSA and stalked that rival while two wide into the first turn, attended to the decent pace through the backstretch run, went up
and pressed CALLHERCONTESSA into the second turn, took a narrow lead into upper stretch and was set down for the drive, was confronted at
mid-stretch by SIGNORINA MERISI and was outkicked into the final sixteenth, could not match strides with the winner into deep stretch and held well for the
place honors at the finish. CALLHERCONTESSA was sent leaving an alert beginning and assumed command of the early running, set the pace into the first
turn and dictated terms into the backstretch run, set a decent pace to the half-mile marker, came under pressure into the far turn and was overtaken into
upper stretch, battled to the furlong marker, was outfinished for second in the final sixteenth and held safely in the end for third. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB)
settled just off of the early pace to begin and saved ground into the first turn, tracked the decent pace into the backstretch run and saved all of the ground to
the half-mile marker, was well placed into the far turn, waited for racing room at the quarter marker then continued to race in traffic into the stretch, found an
opening at the furlong grounds and was unable to muster a response in the late stages. MY YAMMY LADY was allowed to settle while never far back in the
early going, saved ground through the backstretch run and maintained an inside path into the far turn, swung five wide for the stretch run and lacked a rally
in the late stages. WORK TO LIVE was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace from a three wide position into the first turn, raced
widest through the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile pole, loomed three wide along the far turn, shifted four wide for the drive
and was outkicked at mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired.

Footnotes
PRINCESA DEL TIGRE relaxed nicely while rating behind the leading quartet for the initial half-mile, stayed to the inside through the turn, tipped out to the
two path for the stretch run, opened up under a brisk hand ride and was never in danger from that point. SKY MAKER was reserved from the break and
content to track well behind the pace two off the rail through the early going, crept closer to the leaders after passing the half mile pole, then responded
when given the cue to pick up the pace a bit but had to idle behind traffic approaching the quarter pole, tipped four wide for the stretch run and ran on well
but could not catch the winner while finishing well clear of the next horse. SHEZARUNAWAY showed no early speed and was found lagging far behind the
field through the first half-mile, launched a bid heading into the turn and reached the back of the field by the top of the stretch, swung out to the four or five
path, continued to rally and was along for third. BOLD DAUGHTER was not asked for speed early, saved ground throughout, made a nice rally up the rail,
gained the third position yards from the wire but was passed late for the third spot. PROOF OF JAZZ broke well and was first to the turn, opened a clear
lead then attempted to slow down the pace with COUNCILWOMAN JILLY stalking just behind, was set down passing the three furlong pole and hung in to
mid-stretch but did not have a finishing kick. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY hustled from the break but lost the race to the turn to PROOF OF JAZZ, took up a
stalking position just behind and the outside, went into a drive from the five-sixteenths marker but had only a brief response before being engulfed by the
rest of the field and faded down the stretch. SAREEHA (IRE) raced close up while three wide to the far turn, did not respond when set down near the quarter
pole and was outrun down the lane.

Footnotes
GRAZEN SUN broke alertly then took back off of the fast early pace, was allowed to settle while never far back heading into the turn, improved position two
wide at the quarter marker, circled six wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong pole, closed with a rush nearing the sixteenth-marker, surged in
deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail. MAJOR TOM was forwardly placed away from the start, took back and tracked the fast early
pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole, tipped two wide into upper stretch and was asked for run heading
to the furlong marker, improved position at mid-stretch and chased MOB BOSS into the final sixteenth, was outkicked by GRAZEN SUN in deep stretch and
got up in the final strides to secure the place honors. MOB BOSS was sent away from the start and assumed the early lead, set a pressured pace heading
to the half-mile marker, set fast fractions into the turn and shook free nearing the quarter pole, led into the stretch and was set down for the drive, was all out
into the final sixteenth, was overhauled by the winner in deep stretch and just missed for second, while holding safely for third. HAY JUAN was hustled away
from the start, showed good speed and pressed the fast early pace from between runners, kept close attendance to the fast pace into the turn and pressed
while two wide and between rivals at the quarter pole, went three wide into the stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker and chased into the final
sixteenth, battled into deep stretch and was outfinished for the minor awards. AMANOFMYSTATURE was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the fast
early pace outside of a trio of rivals heading to the half-mile marker, chased four wide into the turn and ran in pursuit to the quarter pole, shifted five wide for
the drive, lost position at mid-stretch and could not muster a late response. ELCONDOR prominent away from the start, stalked the fast early pace from
between rivals, raced three wide into the turn and pressed between runners heading to the quarter marker, shifted four wide for the drive and lost position at
mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. COWBOY KISSES stumbled away from the start and was away a bit slowly, chased
the solid early pace from the outside, ran in pursuit three wide into the turn, lost contact into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
PAYNT YA LATER rushed up from the inside to take the lead before a furlong was run, held the rest a length at bay through the turn, easily fended of a bid
from BEAT OF MY HEART from the three-eighths pole, kicked clear in the stretch and won well under a hand ride in a very professional debut. MARS
MAGIC broke well and was initially involved in the early pace battle then opted to back off to a tracking position, stayed to the inside through the turn,
chased the eventual winner down the stretch and was clearly second best. ELWOOD ROAD broke awkwardly and hit the inside gate at the start, tracked the
speed from close up, stayed about three wide in the clear through the turn, tipped out another path for the stretch and made good late rally to get up for the
third spot. CATALINA COCKTAIL was off a beat slowly and lagged near the rear of the field early, responded when put into a stiff drive from the
three-eighths pole, came four wide into the stretch then stalled, finishing evenly in late stages. WHY LOOKY HERE was slow into stride and dropped far
behind early, went into a drive before the turn then was kept to task down the stretch and was making up ground in the late stages. BEAT OF MY HEART
was quickest to break from the gate but was out-sprinted for the lead by PAYNT YA LATER, stalked that one through the turn, made a three-wide bid to
challenge that rival for the lead but was turned back, then was not able to continue the rally down the stretch, weakened and was passed in the late stages.
FIREWORK got squeezed a bit at the start then was was found racing well behind the early pace going into the turn, did not quicken with the rider asking to
pick up the pace and was outrun down the lane. HOT BETTY got off to an awkward start and lost some ground early, angled over to the rail then advanced
on the run down the backstretch, began to struggle to keep up with the pace after passing the three furlong marker and was outrun from there.

Footnotes
NORTH COUNTRY broke out at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered and tracked the decent early pace from the outside, went four wide into
the turn and improved position at the quarter marker, loomed into upper stretch and took command at the furlong grounds, kicked clear while a bit green into
the final sixteenth and pulled away in deep stretch to be much the best. GIANOLA hard sent away from the start, assumed early command and set a decent
pace heading to the half-mile marker, dictated terms into the turn and set the pace while off of the rail approaching the quarter pole, was collared by NORTH
COUNTRY at mid-stretch, was no match for the winner into the final sixteenth and stayed on well in deep stretch to be second best. R HEART OF GOLD
was asked to rate off of the decent early pace, roused into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive and rallied at
mid-stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final sixteenth and was clear in the end for third. COPPERTUNITY tracked the decent early pace from the
inside, saved ground into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, needed
more into the final sixteenth and passed tired rivals in the late stages. CALLUM was bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was off slowly, allowed
to settle in the early running, raced two to three wide into the turn, gained ground into the stretch and offered a mild late rally. ONE BIG SMILE broke in a bit
at the start but was away in good order and vied for the early lead, ceded to GIANOLA and stalked that runner through decent fractions heading into the
turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and faded in the final stages. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was prominent away from
the start and chased the decent early pace, raced two wide into the turn and lost position at the quarter pole, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened in the
final furlong. HOLY SMOKES settled off of the decent early pace, went two wide into the turn and did not factor in the stretch. ALPHABETICAL ORDER got
caught a bit in tight away from the start, showed good speed and rushed up to stalk the decent early pace, improved position three wide into the turn and
ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, chased into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and tired.
DIAMONDS PREFERRED bumped an inner rival away from the start, lacked early speed and showed little.
