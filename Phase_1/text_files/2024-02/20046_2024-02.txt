STAR'S DREAM laid close up inside of the leader leaving the first turn, stalked under snug restraint down the backside, checked entering the far turn,
pursued under restraint tipping to the three path around the far turn, moved to the five path to take aim on the new leaders entering the lane, sustained a bid
and drove past in the final sixteenth. HOT PATOOTIE broke outwardly, tracked three wide, bid into the far turn, vied three deep before gaining an advantage
entering the lane in the four path, inched clear as an outer rival pursued in the final furlong, but was bested by that one late. FLASHYBOY'S LILSIS broke
outwardly, stalked two wide and between horses entering the backstretch, bid along with an outer foe entering the far turn, vied among foes turning for
home, but was headed by her outer counterpart entering the lane, yielded in the final furlong yet held show. DEBS PRAYER broke a step slow before being
jostled between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the four to three path, stayed on between horses entering the final furlong, but was denied
reaching show. I DONT KNOW EITHER jostled with an inner rival thrice at the start, raced off of the pace in the two path, retreated to trail before taking the
far turn in the four path, and made little impact. MRS. NECAISE set the pace outside of a prompter early on, the inside of a pair of bidders into the far turn,
but gave way to them entering the lane. TRINITY HOPE broke a step slow before being bumped and pinched between horses at the start, trailed in the two
path, improved inside of rivals down the backstretch, shifted out and chased from the four path around the far turn, but got floated to the six path entering
the lane and tired.

Footnotes
DOESN'THURTTOFLIRT laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the five path entering upper stretch, rallied to bid outside of the new leader in
midstretch, gained an advantage entering the final sixteenth, inched ahead and held from an outer pursuer. GUEST OF HONOR raced at the rear in the
three to four path around the first turn, trailed in the two to three path around the far turn, altered out to the six path in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at
take aim on the leader late, but needed more to offer a bid. BERLAINE tracked the top pair from the two path, ranged up outside of them around the far turn,
bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage while hanging on his left lead nearing midstretch, met an outer challenge at the furlong grounds, got bested by
that one at the sixteenth pole and yielded. DANCING NANCY vied two wide around both turns, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in upper stretch, gave
way, yet surpassed a tiring rival to reclaim fourth lane. LOVE TO EAT was tough to load, showed the way inside of an outer prompter, vied with that one
turning for home, but was headed by a wider bidder in upper stretch and weakened. SCOOP broke slowly, raced off of the pace in the two path, got a bit
keen between horses nearing the backstretch, then made little impact. JOCASTA broke inwardly, pursued from midpack along the inside, stalked from the
pocket just off the fence around the far turn, paused when blocked behind the leaders entering the lane, aimed to split those foes when an seam opened in
upper stretch, but lacked the kick needed to split those rivals and faded behind mild traffic.

Footnotes
COUNTRY GUY stalked along the inside, tipped to take aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, drove past that one entering the final sixteenth and
drew clear. SHAWN'S SOLVING was bumped by an outer rival and brushed an inner foe at the start, set a clear pace around the turn, maintained a clear
margin through midstretch, but was caught by an outer bidder entering the final sixteenth and narrowly lasted for place. HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT broke a bit
outwardly, trailed along the inside, picked up stride in upper stretch, tipped to the seven path in the final furlong and offered a late surge to miss reaching
place. CHAOTIC JACK bobbled very slightly and bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from off of the pace in the four path, ran on mildly to vie for
minor placings in the final furlong, but was outkicked for show late. FAMILY CREED bumped with an inner rival at the start, pressed two wide before chasing
the clear leader around the turn, then lacked a bid and lost show late. WESTERN STAR took light contact from rivals on both sides at the start, pursued
from midpack along the inside, chased and failed to threaten. MUCHO BUENO tracked in the three path, but lacked a rally between horses. PALANTE
bumped with an outer rival leaving the gates, then made little impact from the two path. PERFECT STRIKE lacked speed in the five path and never got
involved. Z'S GUITAR raced towards the rear lugging to the seven path and was outrun.

Footnotes
IT WASN'T ME tracked along the inside, awaited racing room around the far turn, tipped to the four path for clear sailing entering upper stretch, rallied to bid
along with an inner rival at the furlong grounds and edged ahead. IM SINGLED UP stalked two wide before saving ground in pursuit around the far turn,
tipped to the three path in upper stretch, rallied to bid along with an outer foe at the furlong grounds, but failed to go on with that one in the final sixteenth
and held place. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) settled well back in the two path, saved ground around the far turn, launched a rally to split foes three wide
in midstretch, then belatedly closed in through the late stages and ran out of ground to gain place. CAHUILLA set a clear pace around both turns, but was
caught by an outer bidding pair at the furlong grounds and weakened. HUNTLEIGH pursued from midpack along the inside, then further back two wide
around the far turn, swung six wide entering the lane but only offered a mild kick. BLAME NELLIE pursued from midpack two wide, chased between horses
turning for home but failed to threaten. MISS TAPPY TONE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CLEVER JOKE was bumped by an inner rival into
an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer four wide around the far turn before being floated five wide entering the lane, then only
managed to chase before yielding between horses entering the final sixteenth. CATHERINE BLAZE bumped an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in
the two to three path and made little impact. PRIZE DEBATE tracked three wide and between horses, pursued along foes around the far turn but faded
entering the lane. CALY BALI broke outwardly while off slow, tracked four wide, tugged forward to achieve a stalking position closest to the leader
approaching the half mile pole, chased the clear pace-setter from the two path around the far turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane.
LASSAROCK was squeezed between horses and steadied back at the start, trailed early on, lagged behind down the backstretch and showed little.

REASON TO DREAM set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge entering the final sixteenth and held firm. AUTO DIAL was forced to bump an
outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, took aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, sustained slow progress to bid entering the final sixteenth but
was kept at bay. MACKMAN bumped an inner rival at the start, saved ground off of the pace, advanced inside of rivals to gain show at the furlong grounds
and chased the to pair home. GREAT RUNNER pursued long the inside before moving to the two path to stalk the leader into the turn, was roused to inch
closer turning for home, but lacked a bid before being floated three wide in upper stretch, and gave way. BEAUTIFUL LIFE tracked in the three path, got
floated to the four path entering upper stretch and yielded. MO RUM pursued from midpack in the four to five path and outside of rivals, then faded. CRUEL
ENDEAVOR was jostled between horses and pinched back at the start, failed to recover and lagged behind throughout.

PURE POETRY set the pace along the inside, gamely resisted an outer challenge in upper stretch and held firm thereafter. ROCK N ROLL BOLT stalked
along the inside, smoothly took aim outside of the leader entering the lane, bid but was fended off through the final furlong. NIGHT OUT pursued from
midpack along the inside, chased under urging around the far turn, picked up stride to gain show from outer rivals with three sixteenths to go, tipped outside
of the top pair at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead in the process, then chased the leaders home while needing more to offer a bid.
CABERNAYDO tracked two wide, chased turning for home, lost show to an inner rival in upper stretch before brushing an outer foe entering the furlong
grounds, then held fourth. BRILLIANT BERTI brushed the gate upon leaving it, pursued from midpack three wide, then further back four wide around the far
turn, shfited out to the seven path in midstretch and moved up. KISSTHEMOON trailed along the inside, picked up stride shifting three wide turning for

Footnotes
KOUFAX set the pace as an outer rival applied pressure, dueled with that bidder around the far turn, sparred through the lane and held gamely. UNIFIED
DREAMS pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, battled through the lane but was fended off. FRENCH COMPOSER stalked along the inside, chased
while failing to keep pace with the top pair around the far turn and held show. EL ORIENTE (CHI) laid off of the pace in the two path and improved between
horses late. HE'S GOT THIS lacked speed in the two to three path around the first urn, fanned four wide entering the lane and failed to menace. RUNWAY
MAGIC broke a step slow, pursued from midpack in the three path, chased in the two to three path around the far turn, then yielded between horses in the
final furlong. BEEALEA broke outwardly, trailed in the four path, then in the five to six path around the far turn and was outrun. RIGHTANDJUST bobbled a
bit at the start, tracked in the four path but faded entering the far turn.

PAINT ME PERFECT settled well back two to three wide around the first turn, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, floated eight wide in upper
stretch, then rallied widest to sweep past the leaders in the final sixteenth. SPARTAN QUEEN stalked outside of the leader, pressed around the far turn
before bidding in upper stretch, forged an advantage passing the three sixteenths pole, led into the final sixteenth, but was overpowered by an outer bidder
late and saved place. NOW YUS CANT LEAVE stalked along the inside, encountered traffic behind the top pair in upper stretch, chase tipping outside of
them in the final furlong, got outkicked in the final sixteenth, kept on to bid for place but came up short. SHE'S ON THE ROCKS pursued from midpack two
wide and between horse, took the far turn in the three path, altered course to the seven path in upper stretch, then stayed on between horses. DULCIA set
the pace along the inside, got headed by an outer presser at the three sixteenths pole and yielded late. HECKLED broke a step slow, pursued from midpack
three wide while traveling well in the bit, tipped four wide around the far turn before being floated to the six path entering the lane, sustained a chase before
taking contact from an inner rival at the furlong grounds, and kept on mildly among foes. SAKE (FR) pursued along the inside, awaited racing room around
the far turn, shifted to the four path into upper stretch and chased evenly between horses. HAY STACK broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the start,
tracked three wide, ranged closer turning for home before drifting to the five path entering the lane, failed to sustain a bid and chased in upper stretch, then
drifted out slightly before yielding between horses in the final furlong. LADY MERCEDES trailed along the inside, then cut the gap on the main group in the
final furlong. COCOA ICING was bumped and bothered by an outer rival and forced to bump an inner foe at the start, saved ground off of the pace, shfited
out in upper stretch, but encountered traffic in the five path nearing the furlong grounds, bumped an outer rival while blocked at that station and failed to
recover. MISS RIVER RAT was bumped by an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace two to four wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
CUSTOM CADILLAC set the pace in the two path, drew away from outer pressers in upper stretch and held sway hanging on his left lead. GRAY DANE laid
off of the pace along the inside, took the turn in the two to three path, fanned to the five path entering the lane and rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole.
CATALINA DAY pressed three deep while in the four path around the turn, gained place nearing the lane, maintained that position while hanging on his left
lead through midstretch, but changed over while being bested entering the final sixteenth. BACK BAYOU pressed two wide and between horses, took the
turn in the three path and fade. CAJUN MISCHIEF laid off of the pace in the four to six path and failed to factor. LOVELY SASSICAIA broke out and
bumped a foe at the start, chased along the inside and gave way. PUPPETEER was bumped by an inner rival at the start, chased from midpack two wide
and tired. COUNTRY CHOICE was brushed by an inner rival at the start and showed little. SON OF REALITY was pulled up around the turn and got vanned
off.
