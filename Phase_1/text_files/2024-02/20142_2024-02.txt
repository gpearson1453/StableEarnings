but was caught late, good effort. DIAMOND HEIST tracked the early pace three wide, came four wide into the lane and had a mild late kick. BLAZING RED
chased the early pace on the outside, four wide on the turn and had no significant rally. CARBONITE pressed the early pace two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
DANCING ON MY OWN stalked the early pace three wide, then dueled for the lead two wide on the far turn, made a bid by the quarter pole, then drew clear
leaving the turn and was given a couple pops left handed with the crop and drew off while being ridden out the final sixteenth. FASHIONISTA was four wide
into the first turn, settled three wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out, held place award. FILTERED LIGHT chased the early
pace on the inside, then was shuffled back, advanced two wide on the far turn and then had a mild late rally on the inside. KAZ MUSIC was settled on the
outside, made a mild bid four wide on the far turn but weakened in the drive. REACHING STRIDE was void of early speed and passed the tiring rivals.
UGHROUDA was reserved early and lacked a rally. NAIL POLISH prompted the early pace two wide, then vied for the lead in between rivals at the half mile
marker, then dueled for the lead on the inside on the far turn and tired. THAT'STONY'SSISTER set the pace on the inside and stopped on the far turn.
