Footnotes
BATTLE OF BASTOGNE , well back early, circled three wide on the turn, was fanned five wide at the head of the stretch, closed nicely outside horses, led
late and drove clear. RENNIE lacked speed, raced inside horses on the turn, angled to the four path entering the stretch and rallied between rivals. BOX N
BEN , three wide chasing the pace around the turn, gained the led in upper stretch, went clear in mid stretch and weakened late. KATIE'S NOTION , a
forward leaving the backstretch, raced in the two path on the turn, dropped back a bit leaving the turn, moved to the four path in upper stretch and passed
tired foes. HAMPDEN LANE hugged the inner rail in upper stretch and was steadied when lacking room near the eighth pole. MONCRIEF disputed the pace
outside HAP'S VICTORY and gave way approaching the eighth pole. HAP'S VICTORY showed speed along the inner rail, disputed the pace and gave way
approaching the eighth pole.

Footnotes
GET LIKE MIKE , in last early on and off a hotly contested pace, came off the inside while urged along mid turn, swung out to about the seven path with
momentum past the three sixteenths, straightened away, rolled past foes to his inside with a sixteenth to go and drew away under steady hand
encouragement. I HAD ENOUGH stalked to the inside of a rival early on, dropped back a few lengths leaving the far turn, found more and advance towards
the inside in upper stretch, altered out with a furlong remaining, was hemmed in as the winner went by to his outside, recovered and finished gamely to nab
the place. SIN PERMISO broke inward and was off a beat slow, corrected and saved ground, made steady progress past the five sixteenths, eased out
soon after to be behind foes, dropped back in and threatened between rivals then kept on with good effort while being nipped for second. KICK
STARTNESS , urged along four wide pursuing the dueling leaders, bid five wide outside runners nearing the lane, sparred past mid stretch then faded late.
TIK TOK DADDY , used four wide to move to contention, dropped in a bit and engaged the leader into the turn, dueled on a slim lead while between runners
into the stretch, maintained a slim lead leaving mid stretch then weakened very late. CHOCHOCHO , away alertly, tracked the duelers three wide, bid
between foes to threaten nearing the quarter pole, fought on between horses to the sixteenth marker then weakened late. LANDSLIDE IS HOME sped clear
in the opening furlong, was joined from his outside soon past the half, stayed on to contest the issue to about mid stretch then gave way. HUNDRED
PROOF , well back off the duel and removed from the rail, lacked a rally. AVES MAKIN' WAVES , towards the inside, faded.

ACE NINE NINE hugged the inner rail, prompted the pace down the backstretch, secured command mid way on the far turn, opened up in upper stretch and
lasted under brisk urging. GALATIANS chased the pace near the inner rail down the backstretch and into the far turn, was taken to the three path
approaching the stretch and rallied outside the winner. BRASSTOWN bumped with TINY TIN soon after the start, stalked the pace outside horses down the
backstretch, was fanned four wide turning for home and flattened out. PARADISE PRIDE , three wide the first turn, went clear on the backstretch, raced in
the two path down the backstretch and around the far turn, weakened through the stretch, returned sore and was vanned off. TINY TIN bumped with
BRASSTOWN soon after the start and was no factor. MIRACLE SILVER trailed and jumped a shadow near the finish.

Footnotes
OVERMUCH broke a bit awkwardly, was taken wide into the first turn, tugged her way outside rivals and took over soon into the backstretch, moved clear
under rating after a half mile, remained under confident handling while edging away past the five sixteenths, responded to firmer encouragement in upper
stretch and pulled away while kept to a solid hand ride. TIZ VINNO cleared into the first turn and secured the rail, ceded the lead in early backstretch but
stayed on to stalk the winner, was hard ridden in the clear past the five sixteenths, came three wide for the drive and continued with effort to hold down the
place. CLASSY CHICK hopped at the break, regrouped and rated inside foes leaving the seven eighths, stalked to the inside of a runner heading to the half,
moved out to be three then four wide and went evenly in the final furlong. ZIFFY BUG , three wide stalking outside a rival, was under pressure leaving the
far turn, failed to kick on and retreated through the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
AMORICA attended the pace three deep, moved to near even terms leaving the far turn, dueled outside a pair around the turn, took control soon into the
lane and steadily moved away while kept to a solid drive. BACALL broke a bit inward and brushed with BUCKIN' LUCKY, settled well off the early pace
while saving ground, eased out and split rivals advancing into the lane, edged up behind foes then swung out in mid stretch, straightened away and churned
on to be second best. BUCKIN' LUCKY , off last when brushed at the break, moved up towards the inside, steadied leaving the chute then again before
angling out to chase between rivals, shifted out for the drive, gave willing pursuit past mid stretch then flattened out a bit late. MISSY BOSS prompted the
pace two wide, moved up to threaten into the far turn, battled between rivals around the turn, stayed on to give willing pursuit past mid stretch then faded. R
B'S BIG MOMENT cleared early then dropped in towards the rail, met outside bids after a half mile, fought on inside foes around the turn, was under
coaxing trying to hold position past the quarter pole, raced on her left lead past mid stretch and weakened. NOTAFRAIDTOCHARGE , bumped and in tight
at the break, lost ground four deep past the five eighths, was under pressure around the turn but came up empty. TOHONORSTELLE rushed up early while
saving ground, failed to keep pace into the turn, dropped back and failed to respond. CUNDI , bumped at the start, raced three wide between runners
heading to the turn, chased and gave way.

MYSTIC SEAPORT disputed the pace outside TOUISSET, went clear in upper stretch then increased her advanrage under brisk urging. SWEET SHUGS
stalked the duel while four deep around the turn, advanced to reach a striking position in upper stretch then weakened. TOUISSET , sent to the early lead,
hugged the rail, dueled with the winner to upper stretch and finished gamely in a sharp effort. SISTER SUPREAM lacked speed, raced along the inner rail
on the turn, failed to be a factor and passed tired horses. HIDEWRIGHT AWAY , steadied in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, swung four wide mid
way on the turn and gave way. LADY SERENITY chased the pace, swung wide in upper stretch, lugged in and weakened.

Footnotes
POINT DUME was off a touch slow when tossing his a head a bit as the gates sprung, quickly recovered and was urged up to a forward position while off
the inside, relaxed nicely into the turn then responded when given his cue exiting the three eighths, rolled up to engage three deep past the five sixteenths,
secured command soon into the lane, kicked clear under a drive past the three sixteenths then held firm while kept to task. CATAHOULA MOON , bumped
at the break, steadied soon after, regrouped and rated off the pace while saving ground, was coaxed along in the clear mid turn, slipped through towards the
rail to advance in mid stretch, kept on willingly but failed to seriously threaten in the final sixteenth. BLAME THE TUX broke outward and bumped
CATAHOULA MOON, straightened and moved up to chase two wide behind foes, was under a ride to hold position near the five sixteenths, swung four
wide for a clear run entering the lane, finished with effort and got the bob for the show. NANCY MADE MY DAY , off the pace and under a ride leaving the
far turn, angled five wide for the drive, churned on and just missed the show. DALINAR prompted the pace outside FORCE OF JUSTICE, was under
pressure between runners approaching the stretch, failed to keep up leaving the three sixteenths, drifted in a few times and gave way. FORCE OF JUSTICE
displayed sharp speed towards the rail and handled some outside pressure, could not contain the winner while guided two wide into the lane then
succumbed leaving mid stretch.

Footnotes
BRUDER , angled in after making the early lead, saved ground around the turn, drifted out a bit in mid stretch and held sway under urging. COME RAIN OR
SHINE , a forward factor along the inner rail, throughout, chased the pace and gained the place. MEDAGOOCH , bumped by PEALING LAD leaving the
starting gate, was bumped that one leaving the backstretch, prompted the pace in the two path between horses, drifted out inside the eighth pole and
finished willingly. VILALUZ , in the two path between horses mid way on the turn, swung wide approaching the stretch, lugged in near the eighth pole and
flattened out. PEALING LAD bumped MEDAGOOCH when bearing in at the break, bumped that one again when drifting in leaving the backstretch,
prompted the pace three deep around the turn and weakened in the drive. INDECENT BEHAVIOR broke slowly, was four deep on the tur and gave way in
upper stretch. JOE THE JET broke slowly, briefly steadied in close quarters entering the turn and was outrun.
