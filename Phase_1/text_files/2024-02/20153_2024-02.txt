Footnotes
A PERFECT PATH broke alertly, took back and tracked the early pace from the inside, shifted to the two path along the bend and improved position
heading to the quarter pole, asked for run two wide into the stretch, confronted STYLISH DRESS inside of the furlong marker, closed determinedly into the
final sixteenth, wore down the runner-up in deep stretch and edged away in the final strides to prevail. STYLISH DRESS showed good speed away from the
start, assumed command and set a pressured pace into the turn, shook free along the turn and carved out decent fractions approaching the quarter marker,
showed the way into the lane and was kept to task to the furlong marker, felt pressure from A PERFECT PATH past mid-stretch, met that rival's bid into the
final sixteenth, was bested in deep stretch and held safely at the finish for place honors. DIVINE PASSAGE allowed to settle in the early going, saved
ground into the turn, shifted two wide for the drive, rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was clear in the end for
third. VALERIE forwardly placed away from the start, pressed the decent early pace inside of STYLISH DRESS, ceded the lead to that rival and stalked
from the inside approaching the quarter marker, chased from the rail into the stretch, could not muster a late response and weakened in the final sixteenth.
LADY OF THE RIVER tracked the decent early pace from the outside, was well placed into the turn and tracked three wide to the quarter marker, lost
ground at mid-stretch and did not offer a late rally. EXCLUSIVELY NOBLE was asked to rate away from the start, tracked the decent pace from the outside
heading into the turn, mounted a four wide bid at the quarter marker and raced widest into the stretch, was outrun to the furlong marker and lacked a
response in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
PRETTY THIRSTY stalked the decent early pace from the inside, advanced into the turn and vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, took command
into upper stretch and shook free at the furlong pole, was kept to task under firm urging into the final sixteenth, felt late pressure from TRULY FABULOUS,
dug in into deep stretch and determinedly held the runner-up at bay to prevail. TRULY FABULOUS rated off of the decent early pace and tracked from the
inside, was well positioned into the turn then got caught a bit in tight midway through the bend, was roused leaving the quarter pole and angled three wide
into the stretch, advanced at the furlong marker and rallied into the final sixteenth, was held at bay by the determined winner in deep stretch and was
second best in the end. SUPERSONIC FLYER broke sharply and assumed command away from the start, set a decent early pace and raced off of the rail
heading into the turn, was confronted by PRETTY THIRSTY nearing the quarter pole, lost the lead to that rival into the stretch and chased to the furlong
grounds, could not keep pace with the top pair into the final sixteenth and just held for third at the finish. CRY ME A RUNNER tracked the decent early pace,
raced between rivals into the turn and got caught a bit in tight at the quarter marker, shifted to the inside into upper stretch and chased to the furlong
grounds, lacked the needed late response and just missed for third at the finish. TONI TWO POCKET chased the decent pace from the outside, was well
placed into the turn and stalked three wide to the quarter marker, swung to the four path into upper stretch and gave way in the final furlong. DRESS
REHEARSAL lacked early speed and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CHIEF JACKSON asked for speed leaving the start, raced close up to the early pace and stalked two wide into the first turn, advanced into the backstretch
run and prompted the decent pace approaching the half-mile marker, took command into the far turn and kicked clear into the stretch, was kept to task while
clear into the final sixteenth, felt mild pressure from the runner-up into deep stretch and held safely in a drive to prevail. CHAMPAGNE PEGASUS away in
good order, took back off of the early pace and saved ground into the first turn, saved all of the ground through the backstretch run while not far back,
gained ground into the second turn, tipped two wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed in the final sixteenth but could not catch the winner in
deep stretch and was second best at the finish. SEA OF LIBERTY hopped at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered to race outside of rivals and
stalked the early pace four wide along the first turn, maintained an outside path into the backstretch run and tracked while widest approaching the half-mile
pole, gained ground four wide along the far turn and chased while widest into upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong pole, could not muster a final
response and held for third at the finish. ECOLOGIST unhurried away from the start, saved ground into the backstretch run, went two wide into the far turn,
offered a mild rally in the stretch drive and missed for third at the finish. BABY FRANKIE broke alertly away from the start, ceded the early lead and stalked
the pace three wide into the first turn, raced close up to the decent pace through the backstretch run, mounted a three wide bid at the quarter marker, could
not sustain that run into the stretch and faded in the final furlong. WORKDAY hustled away from the start, assumed command and dictated terms into the
first turn, set a prompted pace through the backstretch run while carving out decent fractions, was overtaken by CHIEF JACKSON entering the far turn,
chased to the quarter pole and tired in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SANGER STYLE did not have the sharpest of beginnings but once hustled quickly got involved in the early pace pressing the issue to the outside of ADDY
PEARL to the turn, opened up turning into the stretch and was never threatened. DIPLOMATIC raced between horses in the tracking group just behind the
pace duel, broke away from those rivals to go after SANGER STYLE at the quarter pole, was unable to reel in that foe down the stretch but finished well and
held the place. SHADOWED THOUGHTS broke sharply but was out-sprinted for the lead, raced on the inside of the trio tracking the leaders, had to wait for
room from the quarter pole to the head of the stretch, split horses near the furlong marker, finished well but was out-kicked for second. NO BEACHES
lagged well behind the field without any apparent mishap early on, kept to the inside through the turn and made a nice late run to gain a few positions but
was much too late. PEGGY THE COLONEL hard to load prior to the start, broke in some at the start but did not cause any trouble, was up with the tracking
group through the early stages, lost some ground going into the turn then tried to mount a railly four wide into the stretch, finished willingly but needed more.
ADDY PEARL broke sharply and vied for the early lead with SANGER STYLE, hung in there to the top of the stretch then did not have another gear to give
and finished evenly. AH BIRDY was a bit slow into stride but steadily advanced into contention three wide down the backstretch, loomed a threat on the
turn, went five wide into the stretch and could not keep up late.

Footnotes
FIVE O COCKTAIL broke alertly and rated nicely off of the solid early pace, tracked the pace while never far back heading into the turn, advanced without
being asked and loomed three wide at the quarter marker, swung three to four wide into the lane and rallied to come within aim of the lead at mid-stretch,
took command nearing the sixteenth-marker and drew away under hand urging in deep stretch. LADY GREGORY showed speed and was forwardly placed
away from the start, stalked the solid early pace from the outside and raced three wide into the turn, advanced to press the pace two wide approaching the
quarter marker, confronted MORNING ADDICTION into the stretch and battled that rival to the furlong marker, was overtaken by FIVE O COCKTAIL past
mid-stretch and could not match strides with the winner into the final sixteenth, battled MORNING ADDICTION for place honors into deep stretch and held
well in the end for second. MORNING ADDICTION a step slow leaving the start, showed good speed and assumed command of the early running,
controlled the pace while carving solid fractions into the turn, showed the way to the quarter marker and led into the stretch while in hand, came under
pressure at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and was outfinished for second, while clear of the rest for third.
MASTERY KAT allowed to settle in the early going while not far back, chased two to three wide into the turn, improved position at the furlong marker, could
not sustain that run into the final sixteenth and flattened out late. MS FLASHY HARBOR prominent away from the start, attended to the solid early pace
while between runners, raced close up heading into the turn, lost ground at the quarter marker and chased from the rail into the stretch, lacked a response
in the final furlong and gave way. YODERANDO hustled away from the start, got caught in a bit of early traffic and chased from the second flight heading to
the half-mile marker, ran in pursuit while saving ground approaching the quarter pole, could not muster a rally in the stretch drive and tired in the final
furlong.

Footnotes
CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN was allowed to settle, raced two to three wide while unhurried along the first turn, was content to track the solid pace approaching
the half-mile marker and raced widest into the far turn, mounted a five wide rally into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, responded to urging and
vied for the lead at the sixteenth-pole, found more in deep stretch and outfinished the game runner-up in the final strides for a determined win. EGOMANIA
was sent leaving the start and vied for the lead into the first turn, contested solid early fractions with HANKS into the backstretch run, disputed the quick
pace to the half-mile marker and dueled with HANKS into the second turn, battled into the stretch and held a narrow advantage approaching the furlong
grounds, fought gamely while holding a slim lead into the final sixteenth, met the bid of CONTRARY CHIEFTAIN in deep stretch and was bested by the
determined winner in the final strides, while holding safely for second. EL JOY was away from the gate in good order, took back in the early going and saved
ground into the first turn, was content to track the solid pace to the half-mile marker, raced three then four wide into the far turn and improved position at the
quarter pole, maintained a four wide path into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker, needed more into the late stages and was outkicked in deep
stretch, while holding safely in the end for show honors. HANKS hustled away from the start, engaged with EGOMANIA into the first turn and disputed solid
fractions with that rival heading into the backstretch run, contested a quick pace to the half-mile pole and dueled with EGOMANIA into the second turn,
battled into the stretch, could not match strides into the final sixteenth and yielded in deep stretch. ATTENZIONE unhurried in the early going, saved all of
the ground into the second turn and advanced into upper stretch, shifted out at the furlong marker and closed well into the final sixteenth but was unable to
threaten at the finish. ARTEMUS GORDON off a step slowly away from the start, was asked for early speed and was forwardly placed into the first turn,
stalked the solid pace through the backstretch run and advanced two to three wide along the far turn, got caught in a bit of traffic into upper stretch and lost
position nearing the furlong pole, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way.

HONORABLE GAL was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from the second flight, raced two wide into
the turn and made a mild gain at the quarter marker, slipped to the rail nearing the top of the lane and was full of run into the stretch, chased SING A
HAPPY SONG past mid-stretch and overtook that rival into the final sixteenth, held a narrow lead while battling the game runner-up into deep stretch and
was fully extended to prevail at the wire. KIKI KRAZY forwardly placed away from the start, took back and tracked the solid pace heading to the half-mile
pole, went four wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, responded to urging and rallied four wide into the stretch, matched strides with
HONORABLE GAL and came within aim of the lead past the furlong pole, battled into the final sixteenth and was denied for the win in the final strides, while
well clear of the rest for second. SING A HAPPY SONG broke out at the start and bothered a neighboring rival, showed good speed and assumed
command of the early running, sped clear into the turn and set fast fractions while clear heading to the quarter pole, maintained a clear lead into the stretch
and was set down nearing the furlong pole, was all out approaching the sixteenth-marker and was overtaken heading into deep stretch, could not match
strides with the top pair in the late stages and held clearly in the end for third. TOM'S PIC was allowed to settle in the early running, raced two to three wide
to the quarter marker, offered a mild rally in the stretch drive and improved position in the late stages. BLURSDAY showed speed and was prominent away
from the start, chased the fast early pace and came two wide into the turn, ran in pursuit to the quarter marker, shifted three wide for the drive and lost
ground at the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and gave way. SOO BROOKLYN chased the fast early pace from the inside and
did not threaten. MERRY BLUE was squeezed at the start and was away slowly, spotted the field to begin and trailed in the early stages, chased three to
four wide into the stretch and did not factor. LADY WOLF away in good order, raced close up to the fast early pace, chased three wide to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired in the final furlong.

Footnotes
CAPO SORELLA broke well, dueled with LEEDS THE SKY to the turn, was traveling well at that point, took command when given the cue passing the
five-sixteenths pole, opened up in the stretch, went well clear and easily held off a late charge from the runner up. OOPS (GB) lacked any speed from the
break and raced well behind going into the turn, built up some momentum around the turn, came three wide into the stretch and produced a bold rally but
came up short. RICKELLE came out of the gate a little awkwardly then raced mid-pack through the early stages three to four wide, switched to the inside in
the middle of the turn, then waited behind some traffic just before the turn for home, responded when set down in the clear and ran on well to gain the third
placing. JAZZY EMPRESS was slow into stride despite the urgings of the rider, found a good rhythm approaching the three furlong marker and put in a
good run from there but was never a threat. HARBOR LASS tracked the pace from the middle of the tracking group, bid three to four wide from the five
sixteenths pole, then ended up five to six wide into the stretch, ran on some, shied from some erratic runners in the late stages but did not affect the
outcome. MISS PERU broke well then was beset by a series of traffic issues, was put in tight quarters after passing the nine-sixteenths marker by
MISITICAL CANDY, then took up sharply at the half-mile marker when that same foe took the path, lost momentum, was starting to re-bid when RICKELLE
came over and forced another check near the three-eights pole, saved ground and attempted a rail rally but could not overcome those early issues.
MISTICAL CANDY was briefly part of the early duel while a little keen and desperate to get in the clear, wanted the rail but lost the path then backed off to
change to the outside, came under a drive from the quarter pole but did not have a response and was out-finished down the stretch. LEEDSTHESKY broke
a beat slow but rushed up and dueled through the early stages with CAPO SORELLA, could not match strides with that rival passing the quarter pole, held
position to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong and faded to last.
