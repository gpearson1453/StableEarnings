GRAN ANDREWS stalked off the rail then challenged leaving the three eighths pole, drew alongside POLAR WIND passing the five sixteenths, contested
the edge two deep on the far turn and dug in determinedly to edge clear. The latter took the lead midway on the opening turn and moved to the inside to set
the pace, came under pressure nearing the three eighths pole, was met passing the five sixteenths, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the rail on
the far turn and remained a factor to late stretch before relenting. ROSE'S PEPINO raced well off the early pace, started a bid leaving the three eighths pole,
improved off the rail on the far turn and closed the gap in an even finish. SOLITAIRE GAME saved ground close to the early pace but showed little response
leaving the seven sixteenths pole.

BACKATYA stalked off the rail, took aim approaching the seven sixteenths pole and closed to the lead toward the quarter, raced clear off the rail midway on
the far turn, drifted entering the stretch but dug in under steady handling and held on well. JAYJAYDEE raced in the three path the opening turn, picked up
the chase past the half mile pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then dueled through the final sixteenth for second. RIDICULOUS settled off
the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in leaving the turn but was outfinished in the
later duel for second. ADVANCE CASH took a quick lead and moved to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
gave up the lead toward the quarter, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn and flattened in the lane. JUBAY saved ground.

Footnotes
DESTIN'S RAINBOW took over approaching the three quarter pole and angled to the inside to set the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths,
widened at the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled to mid-stretch then hand urged the final sixteenth. LOVE IS WICKED raced in the three path the first
turn, left the turn outside and picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path and came along to take second later
yards. BRADLEY DO RIGHT stalked from the three path then gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and flattened
inside the eighth pole. CANDY MAN CAN saved ground racing well off the early pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path
on the far turn and passed some rivals. JONAS HILL ROAD raced in the four path the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little more. LITTLE RICHIE settled off the pace and off the rail the first turn, gave chase from the nine sixteenths
pole and eased out passing the half mile pole, raced in the four path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. YAREAKH became a bit anxious in the gate
then hopped at the break, rounded the first turn in the four path and showed little response through the backstretch. CRUSH 'N RUN showed little response
leaving the first turn. CANDY OUTLINE stalked off the rail the first turn, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole but faded at the rail on the far turn.
