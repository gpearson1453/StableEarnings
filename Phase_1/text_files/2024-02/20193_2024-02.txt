Footnotes
PROTOMAGIC just a bit tardy with no speed, rallied four wide run to lead, battled to the wire to hold sway under good handling. JUSTA SIMPLE GIRL good
position three wide to turn, dueled in the stretch and bested the rest. LOONA LUV good position throughout, gamely in stretch for show spot. BODE'S
ROSE inside run to the turn, improved position a bot in the stretch. MABEE LUCKYNWILD rail speed, dueled to the stretch and faded in the drive. MY
TOMMY LEE never factored throughout. YOGA QUEEN off rail speed, dueled to the turn, gave in willingly late going. EIDA'S STORM never a threat
throughout.

stretch, outkicked. EXEMPLIFIED loped along evenly throughout and just missed show spot at wire. OUR DREAM RYE'D no speed to far turn, rallied along
to close the gap late. CUPID'S CLAWS inside run backstretch, between horses far turn, no late kick. BLUEGRASS PARKWAY bore in start, never
recovered and stayed well back throughout. EL AHIJADO good position to far turn with no response in the stretch run. JR'S GIFT never menaced
throughout. GLOBAL SENSATION tracked from three path to quarter pole, gave in readily stretch. MARQUET MALICE failed to menace throughout. MR
