Footnotes
TAP GOLD set the pace in the three path and held clear under a drive. BACKWOODS BOOGIE tracked the pace three wide around the first turn and two
wide around the far turn, could not gain on the winner in the lane but held off a foe for the place. FLATTER ME had his head turned at the start, raced off the
pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and ran on for the show. DUBBY DUBBIE raced in range four wide, gained four wide around the far turn
and flattened out in the stretch. THENORTHREMEMBERS threw his head just prior to the start and was away slowly, saved ground off the pace, angled
three wide near the quarter pole, shifted widest in upper stretch and was no threat. EUPHORIA STAR was outrun inside. GENTLEMAN GERRY chased the
winner from the inside and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
STARSHIP PIONEER rated in the two path, waited along the inside early into the far turn, swung out to the six path turning into the lane, drifted in while
rallying going into the final furlong, and drew past an inner duo in the closing stages. MADAKET'S ARROW set the pace in the two path, was confidently
handled while just off the rail rounding the far turn, tipped out to the three path while being cued at the top of the stretch, dug in into the final furlong, but was
caught by an outer foe late. SUDOKU TERRY laid up close in the three path turning into the backstretch, bid two wide around the far turn, floated out to the
four path turning into the lane, and kept on for show. IN AWE stalked in the two path, was coaxed along the inside into the far turn, and mildly stayed on
down the lane. CERCHI tracked in the three path, was ridden around the far turn, swung from the five path into the stretch, but was in tight through the final
furlong and made no impact. ETNA'S NAPPER hopped at the start, trailed in the three path, fanned out to the eight path turning into the lane, but did not
threaten. SPREZZATURA raced off the pace in the four path but was no menace. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF CERCHI AGAINST THE
RIDER OF STARSHIP PIONEER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS INQUIRY TO LOOK AT THE INCEDENT
RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

GRAN ROQUE set the pace along the rail, drew off under minimal urging and held well clear while geared down late. BEE A SKY BEAM was shut off at the
stat, raced off the pace two wide and ran on to be clearly second best. VITO'S BROTHER veered out at the start, pressed the winner two wide and was no
match for that foe in stretch. INTRANSIGENT tracked the pace three wide and lacked a closing bid. KINGY was outrun while racing two wide. BAD
HOMBRE played no factor while racing three wide.

MY LADY JAMES stalked inside, waited confidently behind a dueling duo in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the five path while being coaxed
turning into the stretch, and drew past an inner foe around the sixteenth. CALL ME SPICY chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the
turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. BODACIOUS BREN prompted the pace in the three path, bid under a ride
around the turn, led from the three path into the stretch, and kept on, but was caught by an outer pair in the final furlong to show. SONICUS rated in the two
path, floated out to the four path turning into the stretch, and kicked on. CHASING AFTER YOU trailed in the two path and made no impact from the five
path down the lane. GUNESH tracked in the three path, came under coaxing from the four path early into the turn, but failed to menace out in the eight path
down the lane. FACE THE MUSIC set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, but gaveway in the stretch.

rallied through he lane but could not quite get past the winner. HALSTYN ROSE pressed the pace three wide, battled on through the lane and was narrowly
outfinished. MAC TO MOORE raced off the pace two wide, angled five wide in upper stretch, bumped with CREED'S GOLD near the sixteenth pole and
rallied. DEFLECTION broke inwardly, prompted the pace two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and finished evenly while lacking a clear path late.
CREED'S GOLD was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch, was bumped inward near the sixteenth pole and made a
slight late gain. HIDDEN VASE had her head turned at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. BABY BLOCKS was bumped at the start, raced off
the pace two wide, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. ROGERS PARK was reluctant to load, chased the pace three and four wide and

NAUGHTY FAVORS dueled for the lead in the three path, was coaxed along while inching ahead in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the three
path at the top of the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. ZEENA SWIFT laid up close in the four path, was ridden in the three path around the turn, ran
on while on her left lead into the final furlong, switched around the sixteenth, and held place. IT'S ONLY WORDS trailed in the four path and had to steady
into the turn, was cued midway around the turn, fanned out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. MAS VINO bumped with an outer
foe at the start, vied for the lead along the inside but evened out in the stretch. FIELD OF BLOSSOMS tracked in the five path, was roused in the three path
midway around the turn, but made no impact from the five path in the stretch. ISABELLE ANNE stalked in the six path, was coaxed along in the four path
around the turn, but weakened on her left lead from the six path down the lane. BARABAND bumped with an inner foe at the start, pressed between foes in
the two path early, but had to check passing the half, and came up empty.

GUN SONG pressed the pace two wide, took over early on the turn, drew clear in the two path around the bend and widened through the lane while being
ridden out. CATHERINE WHEEL stalked the pace three wide, had aim in upper stretch, lugged in and was clearly second best. MISS SAYELY set the pace
along the rail, could not match strides with the winner around the turn but kept on well enough for third. CLASSIC BALLAD chased the pace two wide and
lacked a closing bid. WEE BIT O MISCHIEF broke a bit awkwardly, raced three wide and never threatened. PURLOIN was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
FUTURE IS NOW set the pace inside, was cued while kicking away in the two path at the top of the stretch, and held safely. RUN FOR THE HILLS bumped
with an inner foe at the start, then again with the same inner foe just after, rated in the five path, was cued in the three path passing the quarter, fanned out
to the eight path turning into the lane, and rallied for place. OH DARLIN tracked in the three path, floated out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept
on for show. STARSHIP NALA bumped with an outer foe and had to steady early, chased in the two path, tipped out to the four path turning into the lane,
angled in passing the eighth pole, but made no impact. SUGAR FIX laid in midpack in the three path, was roused while being herded out to the seven path
turning into the lane, and finished evenly. TALKIN TIPSY prompted the pace in the three path but faded in the stretch. IVORY MOON bumped between foes
early, raced off the pace in the four path and did not threaten. COUSIN KRISTI stalked in the two path but weakened in the stretch. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE
bumped with an outer foe at the start, then got pinched and had to check shortly after, raced wellback along the inside and was no menace.

Footnotes
STARSHIP NEBULA pressed the pace in the three path, took over in midstretch and powered clear through the final furlong. IMPERIOUSLY set the pace in
the two path, yielded in midstretch but held well for the place. ONE SMOKIN' RITA raced in range in the two path, continued on the left lead in the lane,
could not gain on the top two but held for the show. BEER BALI came out and bumped foes at the start, stalked the pace three and four wide, continued on
the left lead in the lane and faded. DOVE IN CHARGE was bumped between foes after the start, raced off the pace three wide and never threatened.
ROUGH ENOUGH was bumped between foes at the start, raced well back four wide and passed tiring rivals. ROBYN AND ELI was pinballed after the start,
raced two wide and lacked the needed rally. GLASS STAR was pinched back at the start, raced four wide and never reached contention. ZOSTEROP was
bumped twice early, saved ground and made little further impact. BREAKING BULLET chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane.
CRASH THE CREASE bumped foes and checked not long after the start, saved ground and was outrun. LADY PETAL was bumped at the start, raced off
the pace outside, was pulled up in upper stretch and vanned off.
