CAPTURE THE TIME dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn and kicked clear in the stretch.
MISTERCHILLIWILLI dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, battled from the two path around the bend and chased the winner home in the lane.
MAJESTIC PHAROAH chased the leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the four path and kept on to the wire. THE GOLDEN ONE raced off
the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and showed no kick. PRINCE MARCO reared up leaving the gate, raced off the pace between
horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and never threatened. SHAMMAH raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
continued around the turn in the four path and made no bid. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS
DETERMINED THAT HORSE FIVE, PRINCE MARCO, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.

the turn, drifted in some in midstretch and drew off from there. TWIRLING GRACE hit the gate leaving it, recovered to lead the way on the inside up the
backstretch, saved ground around the bend and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased that rival home. PRINCESS TERESKA was bumped
by the horse to her outside leaving the gate, tracked the leader on the rail through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and weakened
in the final furlong. MELANCHOLY BLUES veered in and bumped with an inside horse at the start, recovered to chase the leader between horses up the
