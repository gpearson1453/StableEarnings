Footnotes
HEATHCLIFF stalked in the four path, came under a ride in the three path going into the far turn, bid approaching the quarter, swept to the lead while tipping
into the two path at the top of the lane, opened slightly passing the eighth pole, and held safe. T B TWELVE ALWAYS chased in the three path, was driven
in the two path around the far turn, swung out to the five path turning into the stretch, switched leads passing the eighth pole, and ran on for place. GO GO
GE set the pace in the three path, was cued along the inside midway around the far turn, but lost the lead turning into the lane, hung on his left lead in the
three path until late, and evened out for show. MACASSAR trailed along the inside and made no impact from the four path in the stretch. PASSAGE raced
off the pace in the two path but did not threaten. DECISIVE WARRIOR tracked in the two path but was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
JOHANNY settled off the pace while racing two and three wide, angled out in upper stretch, was steadily floated out through the stretch, closed
determinedly and was up late. LOOKINFORBARGAINS had early speed inside, settled back when a rival became intent on the lead around the first turn,
angled out down the backstretch, bid three wide around the far turn, reached near even terms near the quarter pole, steadily drifted out under left-handed
urging throughout the stretch run, led leaving the eighth pole and was narrowly outfinished. RISK THRESHOLD (IRE) was unprepared for the start and was
off about three lengths behind the field, saved ground well back, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn and ran on for the show. SELF
CONFIDENT was bumped after the start, saved ground and never threatened. LADY ASTORIA stalked the pace two wide, bid between foes around the far
turn, led from the quarter pole to midstretch and tired. FACTOR THAT set the pace inside and gave way near the quarter pole. STARTERS ORDERS
bumped after the start, saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and retreated. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY
INTO THE START AND FOUND NO REASON TO TAKE ACTION.

Footnotes
BELTS 'N BROOKS stalked inside, was cued from the three path early into the turn, bid between foes in the four path turning into the lane, took the lead
while drifting out against right handed encouragement passing the eighth pole, and drew clear. LOOKINASSAH tracked in the five path, ranged up in the
four path while under a ride rounding the turn, got floated outward through the stretch, but kept on to get up for place. JAMES GANG set the pace in the two
path, was roused turning into the stretch, but lost the lead passing the eighth pole, and evened out for show. UPSTREET chased in the three path, was
coaxed along from the rail around the turn, but made no impact. DANLEY raced off the pace in the six path, was driven in the four path around the turn, but
never threatened. ANTILLEAN threw his head as the gates opened, trailed around the three path and never menaced. RUNNIN' BLOCK prompted the early
pace in the four path, but backed up around the turn, and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
JOKES UP settled off the early pace outside, advanced three wide around the turn, moved to the front in midstretch and drew clear while ridden out.
DAVID'S ROSE set the pace inside, was collared leaving the eighth pole but kept on for the place. NIKEE KAN prompted the pace two wide between foes,
lacked the needed rally and held well enough for the show. MY SUNNY VALENTINE saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and was no
threat. FLAG WOMAN hit the starting gate, raced three and four wide and was no menace. CANADIANSWEETHEART chased the pace inside and faltered
in the lane.

Footnotes
ETNICO set the pace inside, tipped out to the two path turning into the lane, and kicked away. UNSOCIABLE raced off the pace in the four path, was driven
in the three path around the turn, swung from the six path into the lane, and chased on for place. AMOR LEJANO (ARG) chased in the three path, was
coaxed along in the two path around the turn, tipped out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and kept on for show. RIBBONS AND MEDALS pressed
the winner in the three path, was ridden in the two path around the turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. ALL ABOUT LUCKY broke in at the start,
stalked along the inside but weakened from the rail down the lane. MENELIK rated in the two path but never threatened. EXECUTIVE SEARCH hopped at
the start and trailed throughout.

TAPRIXIE tracked the pace three wide, closed steadily through the lane and was up in the final strides. FAR AND FEW set the pace in the two path and led
until the final strides. HALEY'S HONOR stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside of the pacesetter in midstretch and fought on inside to hold the show.
WORSHIP was off a step slow, saved ground off the pace, swung seven wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed third. PERILOUS was
bumped at the start, made progress three wide around the turn but was outkicked between foes in the lane. BABY BLOCKS saved ground off the pace,
swung five wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally. LIONZA was off a bit slowly, raced well back two wide, swung eight wide in upper stretch and rallied
belatedly. HER DIAMONDS went evenly while racing two wide. URGENCE was bumped between foes at the start, raced three wide and made little impact.
SPINNING was bumped at the start, raced four wide and played no factor.

IMPROPTUDE raced off the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path midway around the turn, angled out to the six path at the top of the stretch,
was herded out slightly while making a bid approaching the sixteenth, but inched ahead of an inner foe late to win. JIGSAW stalked in the five path, bid in
the three path under confident handling passing the three-eighths, took the lead while being cued from the five path into the lane, but drifted out
approaching the sixteenth, and was outlasted by an outer foe to place. ALWAYS A WAY trailed out in the six path, was driven in the four path around the
turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the stretch, and was up for show around the sixteenth. ROAR READY bumped with an inner foe at the start,
chased in the five path, was driven three wide around the turn, but flattened in the five path down the lane. LOUIE THE SUN KING set the pace inside, but
yielded from the two path in the stretch. DR BAYTER bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, but backed up between
foes from the two path around the turn.

Footnotes
BEACH PARTY BINGO set the pace in the two path and held firm under a drive. CRYSTAL COAST saved ground off the early pace, advanced four wide
around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and won a three-way photo for the place. BURNAWAY raced off the early
pace three wide, angled in late on the far turn, saved ground around the far turn, swung five wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just missed second.
PRETTYKEEN tracked the pace inside, lacked a clear path in the lane, angled out late and just missed second and third. PALACE FLIRT broke outwardly,
prompted winner in the three path, lacked the needed rally and checked in very deep stretch. PEACE SEEKER failed to menace while racing two and three
wide.

Footnotes
SHEKKY SHEBAZ stalked inside, was roused while tipping out to the three path early around the turn, took aim from the five path at the top of the lane, and
drew past the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth. DESTIN'S MISSION set the pace in the two path, was cued turning into the lane, and ran on, but was
caught by an outer foe around the sixteenth to place. COMEDY TOWN laid up close in the four path, bid in the three path around the turn, but finished
evenly in the four path down the stretch for show. NIGHT JUMPER prompted the pace in the three path, was roused in the two path midway around the
turn, but flattened on his left lead down the lane. RICHY had awkward start, trailed in the two path and made no impact. IMMORTALIZATION raced off the
pace in the two path, fanned out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and did not factor. SIR SEAMUS rated in the three path, was ridden from the rail
around the turn, but failed to bid from the five path in the stretch. COSMIC SPECULATION chased in the four path, was driven in the five path around the
turn, but weakened in the stretch.
