Footnotes
MO SATURDAYS sped clear early on, widened his advantage turning for home and drew off under no urging. MY TENNIS SHOES broke slowly, trailed
along the inside, advanced inside of foes around the turn, sustained his rail charge to gain place nearing the three sixteenths pole and was second best.
LARRY'S LUNCHBOX broke a step slow, laid off of the pace four wide and ran on to be best of the rest. MO HAWK MAN raced forwardly two wide and
between horses, but faltered into the turn then steadied while retreating to last at the five sixteenths pole, yet surpassed tiring rivals and prevailed in a photo
for fourth. PRINCE COSMO tracked three wide, chased between horses around the turn and failed to factor. CAJUN WARRIOR brushed the inner half of
the gate upon leaving it, prompted while a bit keen inside of rivals early on, chased from the two path into the turn as the leader's closest pursuer, but gave
turning for home and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
RULEROFTHEUNIVERSE stalked along the inside, loomed a danger from the pocket around the far turn, smoothly split the leaders two wide entering the
lane, assumed command with three sixteenths to go and drove clear. SNOW KING pressed two wide, but was outmoved by an inner rival while getting
floated three wide entering the lane, then edged place at the furlong grounds. RUNNIN MUNNIN tracked three wide, shifted four wide entering the lane and
ran on willingly. BAYOU MAGIC showed the way along the inside, but proved no match for an outer bidder in upper stretch and gave way. DEN'S GOOD
GRACE laid off of the pace in the two path around both turns and made little impact. BARON OF THE NILE trailed along the inside around the first turn and
was outrun.

Footnotes
BELLA CRUELLA set the pace in the two path, got headed by an early bidder with a half mile to go, stalked that head-strong new leader from the two path
into the far turn, rebid outside of that one in upper stretch, led into midstretch, inched clear with a sixteenth to go and held sway. SHARP FLAME bumped
with an inner rival twice before steadying back between horses at the start, trailed early on, moved out of last outside of foes down the backstretch before
chasing from the four to three path around the far turn, shifted back four wide entering the lane, then ran on to gain place in the final sixteenth but needed
more to reel in the leader. TAYLORS MAGIC bumped with an outer rival twice at the start, then got rank and steadied hard behind foes passing the wire for
the first time, fanned to the five path into the first turn, settled tucking to the three path around that bend, but altered course back to the five path entering the
backstretch, pulled forward to bid outside of the leaders with nine sixteenths to go, drew clear tucking to the inside approaching the far turn, showed the way
before meeting an outer challenge in upper stretch, got headed at the three sixteenths pole, yielded and saved show. BLUE VORTEX stalked while close up
along the inside early on, tracked the clear leader around the far turn, shfited ground outwardly passing the three sixteenths pole, then chased evenly but
missed show. LOVE LIGHT laid off of the pace in the two to five path and failed to factor. CATCHYALATER stalked in the four to three path, but yielded
between horses approaching midstretch. GALADINI got very rank among foes moving through the lane for the first time, tracked forwardly two wide and
between horses, steadied among foes at the three quarter pole before doing so again entering the backstretch, then was shuffled back behind a fading rival
at the half mile pole, saved ground towards the rear around the far turn and made little impact thereafter. ALWAYS AUDACIOUS prompted in the four to
three path around the first turn, yielded two wide and between horses with nine sixteenths to go before further weakening into the far turn.

Footnotes
WARDY set the pace a bit off of the inner railing, resisted an outer challenge nearing the lane, held firm through midstretch before drifting out through the
final sixteenth, and maintained an advantage. J T'S IMAGINATION pressed two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, but was kept at bay through
midstretch before being herded outwardly by the drifting leader through the final sixteenth and held place. YO DADDY settled well back in the three path,
gained swinging to the four to five path entering the lane and sustained his rally to miss reaching place. BECAUSE THE NIGHT bumped an inner rival at the
start, laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, split foes two wide passing the quarter pole, but leveled off through the lane.
BARNABY bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked two wide, chased three wide around the far turn but yielded between horses in upper stretch.
SMOOTHDINI took simultaneous contact from rivals on both sides at the start, stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. NOT
LISTENING pursued from midpack in the four path, but faded getting floated to the five path at the quarter pole. DUMBSTRUCK broke outwardly and
spotted the leaders multiple lengths at the start, lagged behind and was outrun.

TOMMIE G leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, tracked in the four path, moved to press the leader into the far turn, vied two wide before gaining an
advantage entering the lane and drove clear. MO DIVA broke a step slow, laid off of the pace three wide, took closer order outside of rivals before tracking
in the three path around the far turn, ran on to gain place in midstretch while chasing the clear leader and proved second best. SWEET ALEXIS brushed the
inner part of the starting gate while off awkwardly laid off of the pace two wide, gained ground in the five path around the far turn, but flattened out fanning to
the six path entering the lane, yet ran on to improve between horses late. EVERYLITTLESINGH set the pace while tugging in the bit in the three to two path
around the first turn, met an outer challenge entering the far turn, got headed by that bidder entering the lane and gave way. JUS PRESS STAR hesitated
momentarily at the start, tracked along the inside, chased shifting to the four path around the far turn, then drifted further out in upper stretch and lacked a
bid. LAWLESS TIMES stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn, shfited out to the four path entering the lane but lacked a bid. CRAFTROOM

Footnotes
TARNEEMA broke a step slow, pursued from midpack along the inside, moved out to the four path at the five sixteenths pole to launch a rally, progressed to
bid outside of the leader in midstretch, then kicked clear approaching the final sixteenth and was put to hand late. TEMPTING LADY tracked two to three
path, moved forward into the far turn bid for the lead outside of the leader turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane, led through upper
stretch, but proved no match for an outer bidder passing the furlong grounds and was second best. WITHOUT CAUSE stalked along the inside, was
outmoved by an outer bidder while forced to tap on the brakes just behind the pace-setters into the far turn, stalked turning for home before tipping to the
three path to take aim entering the lane, but was outkicked for place by an outer rival in upper stretch and ran on to hold show. RAGTIME LADY saved
ground while rating off of the pace, moved out picking up stride in upper stretch and stayed on willingly. MISS HARMONIC trailed along the inside early on,
raced towards the rear two wide and between horses around the far turn, cut the corner entering the lane, shifted out in upper stretch and moved up mildly.
MARTYNAS' JOY showed the way along the inside, met an outer challenge while taking the far turn in the two path, got headed by that one entering the
lane and weakened. WILLOWY laid off of the pace in the four path and failed to factor. ALLEGRODIMOLTO pressed the leader from the three path, chased
between horses approaching the far turn and steadlly fdaed. JOYFUL IMAGE lacked speed two wide and made little impact. BEYOND BEAUTY laid off of
the pace two wide, got floated to the five path by the eventual winner turning for home and gave way.

Footnotes
J Z'S FIRST laid well back along the inside, circled rivals gaining in the five to six path turning for home, sustained progress to bid at the three sixteenths
pole, led into the final furlong and held sway. DRE ME LESS chased along the inside, bid in the four path along with an outer rival in upper stretch, but was
outkicked entering midstretch, fought on and held place. AVERI EVER AFTER saved ground far back, then rallied inside of rivals but was kept at bay for
place. FOUR PRINCESSES lacked speed in the three path, picked up stride around the far turn before swinging to the seven path in upper stretch, rallied to
take aim on minor placings and leveled off late. PI YO PRINCESS laid off of the pace in the three path, advanced in the four to five path and between rivals
entering the lane, then chased thereafter. SWEET PERFECTION prompted along the inside, gained an advantage entering the far turn, but was headed by
outer bidders at the three sixteenths pole and yielded. PAT HAND GIRL steadied between horses soon after the start, trailed, fanned to the eight path in
upper stretch and moved up. NO NANNETTE NO pursued from midpack in the two path, chased and gave way. VARSITY FLYGIRL pursued from midpack
in the three path, chased around the far turn, drifted to the four path and weakened between horses. KITTENOFTHE COURT tracked in the three path and
faded between horses around the far turn. WATRUGONNADOKAREN set the pace in the three path, got headed by an inner bidder into the far turn and
faltered between horses entering the lane. FAT AND FURIOUS lacked speed in the five to six path, bore wide entering the lane and was eased thereafter.
