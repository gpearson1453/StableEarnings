TINCAN CAT pressed the pace, took command around the second turn, pulled away and finished well. BLUME vied for the early lead, saved ground,
proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. STYLING HOOK lacked early speed, made a mild bid, but proved no match for the top two.
JOSIE'S PRIORITY pressed the early pace, had an outside trip, faded and was no threat late. CATCH ME T had a tight start, racing in the rear, checked
around the first turn to avoid down rivals, was distanced to wire and trailed the field. PRINCE PERFECTA lacked early speed, fell over down rival, lost rider
and walked off. WHISKEY RED dueled on the front end, bled, fell around the first turn, lost rider and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GOLDUSTER pressed the pace, raced outside around the turn, dueled down the lane with HALO MOON and proved the best. HALO MOON dueled on the
front end in the beginning, drove clear around the turn, dueled late and was outfinished for the win. RUNANDHIDE WIND showed early speed, came around
the turn wide and followed the top two to the wire. SEA FORCE raced near the back in the early going, saved ground around the turn, got up for fourth, but
was no real factor. TEXAS TURBINE raced near the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. A'DEBRIS vied for the early advantage, saved ground
and faded. EL JEFE COBB void of early speed and was never a threat. RAUL'S ENCANTO pressed the early pace, came around the turn on the outside
and faded. PITALE broke the gate open before the start, showed brief speed and dropped back. ONE TOUGH CHARLIE reared at the start, racing in the
back and was never close.

Footnotes
BERTIE'S GALAXY pressed the pace, took command around the turn, pulled away and won handily. SAMMY DANSEUR JR. unhurried in the beginning,
moved up, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. UPTOWN SOCIAL pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and went to the wire
evenly. GRAMI'S BOY broke in, raced near the back in the beginning, moved up, but was no factor. SPARKIN void of early speed and was never a threat.
CUSTOM DEELITE raced within contention, saved ground around the turn and dropped back. OIL MONEY was bumped at the start, quickly went to the
front, was pulled up around the turn and vanned off.

Footnotes
JOHNNNY'S GAME stalked the leaders in the early going, took the lead around the second turn, pulled away, racing in the middle of the track and proved
the best. JUST BECAUSE pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. RED OCTOBER lacked
early speed, gained position and was a clear third. STONECOAT lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no factor. ADMIRAL RISTY pressed the
early pace and was finished early. MOONSHINE SURFER hesitated at the start, left at the post and passed tired ones. QUICK ZONG went to the front,
saved ground and tired. KAT'S SOLDIER lacked early speed, finished wide and was never close.
