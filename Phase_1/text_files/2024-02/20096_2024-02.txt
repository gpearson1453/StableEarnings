Footnotes
AFTER SUNDOWN stalked pacesetters off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, advanced four wide mid turn and into the lane,
asked right handed and responded to drive past rival mid stretch. NENE ROMANO pressed leader three wide on the backstretch, continued three wide on
the turn, took the lead late on the turn, continued to lead in upper stretch, overtaken mid stretch and gamely kept on to hold second. AUNTIE BEV stalked
the pace being a bit headstrong on the backstretch, did not take the turn that well fighting the rider most of the turn, swung six wide into the lane and made
mild gain to get up for third. VEGAS DREAM brushed with rival at the start, sent to dictate terms inside of a pair of rivals, continued to lead the way into the
turn, overtaken late on the turn, stayed on until tiring in the final sixteenth. DANCE KID away cleanly, trailed the field and saved ground throughout,
continued to save ground in the lane and made mild progress along the rail under urging. RUN AUNTIE T RUN lightly brushed with rival at the start, sent to
contest early, lead, pressed inside leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, prompted in upper stretch and lacked
response.

Footnotes
LONDON TOBY bumped both sides start, rallied, got up. MARCELO away well, weary late, nailed. SCOOPS DYNASTY broke in/bumped start, leaned in
early, game. HES CHICKLESS away best, drifted in early, outfinished. FUTURE VERSION came out/bumped start, altered in early, lug in 1/8. JERIKO hit
gate/off slow, willingly. MAHOMES MAGIC broke in/bumped start, lost path early. MR RACY PERRY lost footing start. TAKE A SWIG OF THIS antsy,
brushed start, shied early, weakened.
