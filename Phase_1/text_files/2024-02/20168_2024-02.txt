PRESUMPTIVE CLOSER showed good early foot and drew off to be well clear under strong handling. FREEDOM FLASH stalked the pace, had an inside
run and was no match forr the winner. RING TAILED TOOTER raced five wide around the first turn, pressed the leader from the outside through the far turn
and weakened a bit through the drive. BREAKING THE BANK dropped back early, raced two to three wide and needed more. TREASURE COAST stalked
the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. SCRATCH ME showed good early foot from the inside and gave way. RISKY SITUATION
failed to menace.
