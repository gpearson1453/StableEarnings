Footnotes
DIAMOND RIM , with the pace four wide and between rivals, dueled under coaxing past the five sixteenths, stayed on as MR. WHO got away a bit in upper
stretch, shifted well out in the track near mid stretch, came back determinedly under strong handling and got up in the final jumps. MR. WHO took command
soon after the break and was guided to about the three path, handled outside pressure while nudged along leaving the far turn, shook clear under a drive
past the three sixteenths, wandered outward through the final furlong, dug in when re engaged in deep stretch, kept on gamely but just failed to hold.
HOLDEN THE LUTE , three deep and five wide prompting the pace, was under a ride chasing the top pair into the stretch, altered in near the furlong
grounds and gave way. The half mile fraction of 47.68 was hand timed.

Footnotes
PARS AND BIRDIES angled out near the five eighths and edged up outside of a rival, chased the dueling leaders while in the clear and well off the rail mid
turn, shifted out to be about seven wide in upper stretch, closed stoutly under pressure and outside foes, forged to command in deep stretch and edged
clear. SEA BREEZE BOY set a pressured pace towards the inside, was guided three wide clearing into the lane, straightened away maintaining the
advantage past mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and was clear for the place. CHIEFS BLANKET disputed the pace outside SEA BREEZE BOY, shifted five
as the leader got away in upper stretch, pursued past mid stretch but came up empty. HUSTO had speed between foes then was rated back off the leaders
near the five eighths, was under asking past the five sixteenths, angled in through the drive and gave way. WOLF'S LIFE broke a step slow and was outrun.
JOE DID IT , off the pace, saved ground into the turn but failed to respond. I'M MR. SHENANIGAN veered out at the break, corrected then drafted back off
the pace, saved some ground near the three eighths then gave way.

Footnotes
ELDORADO DREAM prompted the pace four wide between rivals nearing the half mile marker, remained close up under coaxing and outside a foe past the
five sixteenths, closed in and engaged BIG MAMA THORNTON from her outside leaving the furlong grounds, wrested command inside the sixteenth marker
and held firm under a drive. BIG MAMA THORNTON took command early and set a pressured pace inside a host of runners, spurted clear three wide under
asking in upper stretch, wandered outward when collared near the sixteenth pole and continued valiantly to the wire. DANSMETOTHENDOFLOV drafted
back off the early pace, edged up to the inside of runners leaving the three eighths, angled six to seven wide for the drive and closed steadily. THE REIGN
SONG forced the pace three wide and between foes, failed to keep pace into the lane, shifted in and faded. DAWN AT LAST , six wide outside rivals
prompting the pace into the turn, dropped back around the turn then showed a bit of late interest. KEBA LUCKY DAY , five wide between runners heading to
the turn, gave way. TIZ SIMPLY AWESOME , off a bit slow, saved ground with a mild move leaving the far turn, chased then gave way.

LAUNCHED quickly went clear, set a rated pace two to three wide, responded when set down in upper stretch, kicked away and was kept to task.
REPLETE eased out advancing leaving the far turn, gave closest pursuit around the turn and into the lane, wandered outward through the final furlong but
stayed on willingly to be second best. SEAU , three to four wide stalking the pace, chased between runners nearing the lane then finished evenly.
NUMEROLOGIST hopped at the break, regrouped while wide, circled five wide into the lane but lacked a serious finish. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY , inside
rivals leaving the far turn, eased out and chased between runners past the quarter pole, failed to kick on past the three sixteenths and faded.
AWHITESPORTSCOAT saved ground mid turn and gave way.

Footnotes
DADS ESTRELLA , between rivals leaving the far turn, took closer order four wide into the lane, closed in and engaged the leader from her outside soon
past mid stretch, responded to a left handed ask and edged away. SWEET SONNY sped clear early, set the pace off the inside, dug in when collared
leaving mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. WE ALL AGREE broke awkwardly, recovered and moved up outside rivals, circled six to seven wide into the
stretch and churned on. EMILY SMILES , between rivals into the turn, chased around the turn but lacked a serious response. SAILING ALONG broke a bit
slow, steadied off heels while saving some ground into the turn, angled six wide for the drive and had some belated aciton. LOCK IT DOWN chased two
wide and faded. MANHATTAN CHERRY brushed at the break, raced three deep leaving the far turn, came five wide for the drive and gave way. CREME
DE MENTHE dropped back.

Footnotes
JAIME'S COMMITMENT disputed the pace three wide outside STAND TO, edged away slightly past the sixteenth marker then held firm while kept to task.
UPPER ROOM , taken to rate early, moved closer between foes leaving the far turn, eased out for the final furlong and closed gamely. STAND TO vied
between foes early, battled two wide inside the winner from the five sixteenths past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. BOOMER JUSTICE stalked the
dueling leaders while four to five wide, was under pressure into the lane but lacked a serious finish. TAINO HOUSE , between runners early, came seven
wide for the drive but failed to threaten. CHAMPS SUCCESS , five wide, came up empty. TRACK BOUND , sluggish from the gate, raced three wide mid
turn and lacked a rally. RED HOT CAT failed to menace and raced towards the inner rail in mid stretch. CAJUN FIRE vied briefly inside foes and weakened.
