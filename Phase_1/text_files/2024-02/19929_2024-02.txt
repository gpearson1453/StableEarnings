quarters in midstretch and dug in to the wire, narrowly missing. AWESOME CITY raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, came
around the second turn in the two path and made up some ground in the stretch while never threatening. GUN RIGHT saved ground around the first turn,
settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and was outkicked in the lane.

outside for the run up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and improved position in the stretch. FIRST SLEW saved ground around
the first bend, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn and chased on to the finish. TWO MINUTES

Footnotes
MAGIC HEART raced in the three path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the far bend, dueled
in upper stretch and kicked clear. FIDELIGHTCAYUT bumped mildly with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the four path around the first bend,
tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the second turn still in the four path and chased on to the wire. LORD KNOWS raced in
the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and improved position in the
stretch. BATI KING saved ground early, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position
in the lane. DEEP STRIKE dueled on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the far turn and
weakened in the final furlong. LATE NIGHT LIVING bumped with the horse to his outside at the break, raced in the four path around the first turn, settled off
the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the five path and made up some ground in the lane while never
threatening. MITHRIX raced in the two path early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in
the two path and was outkicked from there. OUTOFTHEDARK raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch,
continued to battle from the three path around the far turn and faded in the stretch. UNCLE KENNY raced at the back of the pack in the two path through the
opening half mile, swung out to the five path coming around the far turn and made no bid. CODE ENFORCER saved ground around the first turn, trailed the
field up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and was never a factor.
