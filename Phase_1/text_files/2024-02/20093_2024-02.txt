Footnotes
LADY GOOD TROUBLE was sent to establish the early lead, drew to a clear lead along the first turn and controlled the pace while setting moderate
fractions through the backstretch run, showed the way while well handled into the far turn, felt pressure from SHANA MADEL into the stretch, held that rival
at bay into the final sixteenth and drew clear in the late stages to prevail. SHANA MADEL broke alerly and was prominent away from the start, ceded the
early lead and stalked the pace two wide along the first turn, was well positioned into the backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace to the half-mile
marker, advanced into the far turn and prompted LADY GOOD TROUBLE approaching the quarter marker, raced within aim into the stretch and chased to
the furlong grounds, was turned away by the winner into the final sixteenth and stayed on in deep stretch to be second best. UNION HEIRESS allowed to
settle while never far back in the early stages, pulled on the rider along the backstretch run and stalked the moderate pace three wide at the half-mile pole,
chased three wide into the far turn, was outkicked at mid-stretch, lacked the needed response in the late stages and held safely in the end for show honors.
SOLO SOLATAIRE (IRE) was squeezed a bit away from the start and broke a half-step slowly, recovered to be forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked
the moderate pace while saving ground into the backstretch run, saved all of the ground into the far turn, was outrun into the stretch and weakened in the
final sixteenth. MY MOTORHOME was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide into the backstretch run and trailed while not far back heading to the
half-mile marker, was outrun into the second turn and gave way in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
BLOSSOMING went quickly to the front, set a comfortable pace and went unchallenged to the far turn, took on a bid from PANDEMIC GIRL at the quarter
pole, turned that one away turning into the stretch, then was taken on to the outside by TOP ANTICIPATION (GB) , kept that foe at bay under strong
handling and intermittent urging despite drifting out near the wire. TOPANTICIPATION (GB) settled in the middle of the field but only a couple of lengths
behind the pacesetter, launched a bid three wide three wide on the far turn from the three quarter marker, was up to bid for the lead approaching the quarter
pole, rallied strongly on the left lead while trying to catch BLOSSOMING, straightened and was still getting closer approaching the wire but came up a neck
short. MATCHLESS got caught four wide through the first turn, then chased two off the rail near the back of the tight pack, came five wide into the stretch
and was slowly gaining on the leaders but ran out of time. JAZZY LOVE was not asked for speed from the break, steadied slighly going into the first turn,
bided time near the rear of the compact field to the far turn, kept to the inside, ran on well but came up short. PANDEMIC GIRL allowed BLOSSOMING to
dictate the early pace and was content to track from a length or two behind, occasionally pressing the issue down the backstretch, then went to challenge in
earnest at the quarter pole could not threaten the eventual winner and was outfinished.

Footnotes
BIG DON'S SMILING broke alertly and was sent to establish the early lead, set moderate fractions while well handled heading into the turn, controlled the
pace while clear approaching the quarter marker, maintained a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and was clear at the finish
to hold sway. DUPLICATION rated off of the early pace and tracked between rivals heading to the half-mile marker, maintained a two wide position while
between runners into the turn and was boxed in nearing the quarter marker, found room into the stretch and split rivals approaching the furlong marker, was
not able to impact the winner in deep stretch and closed in the final strides to secure place honors. JERSEY BABE was prominent in the early stages and
tracked the moderate pace from the inside, was well placed heading into the turn and chased BIG DON'S SMILING to the quarter marker, maintained an
inside path into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, stayed on into the final sixteenth and was just edged for second in the final strides,
while holding safely for third. SURPRISE FASHION tracked the moderate early pace from the outside, raced three to four wide into the turn and tracked to
the quarter marker, shifted five wide for the drive and offered a mild late rally. WARRENS CANDY MAN was crowded by a neighboring rival at the start and
was off slowly, was unhurried in the early stages and trailed to the half-mile marker, went two wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch,
closed in the final furlong and improved position in the final stages. MAGICISTHEMOONLITE close up in the early stages, was well positioned heading into
the turn and tracked the pacesetter three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. REGULATION DAZED
broke in a bit at the start and crowded a neighboring rival, tracked the moderate early pace from the inside, lost position approaching the quarter marker and
gave way in the stretch. JOHNNY PAYCHECK was forwardly placed away from the start, ceded the early lead and stalked the moderate pace from between
rivals, kept close attendance to BIG DON'S SMILING while two wide at the quarter pole, lost ground approaching mid-stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
BRONZE GIRL seized the lead from the start, set solid fractions to the turn, opened up a bit turning for home and held clear to the wire. LITTLE NAUGHTY
hustled from the gate but was outsprinted to the lead, was kept in a drive throughout, bid three wide on the turn, was cutting into the margin in the last
sixteenth but came up short. CROWN OF HOPE broke well and raced on the inside of the group chasing BRONZE GIRL, tipped out a path on the turn to
set up a three wide bid as the field turned into the stretch, was set down from the three-sixteenths pole, was unable to threaten the top pair but ran on well
enough to gain the third spot. PONDERGATING came away well but chose not to engage in a pace duel and settled comfortably behind the pace set by
BRONZE GIRL, responded when asked to go on heading to the five-sixteenths pole, kept to the inside then flattened out in the stretch and just failed to hold
third. AUTISM COUNTS was a little slow to get going but joined the tracking group before the turn, did not go on when the pace quickened on the turn and
ran on evenly to the finish. DESERT RUMBLE had no speed from the break despite the best efforts of the rider, dropped behind early, kept to the inside
through the turn and was put into a drive turning into the stretch but could not make up any ground and chased the field to the wire.

Footnotes
BABY KRISTEN was hustled away from the start, assumed command of the early running and was asked to rate while setting a decent pace into the turn,
set pressured fractions to the quarter marker and shook free into the stretch, drifted while clear past mid-stretch, was kept to task under firm hand urging
into the final sixteenth and held safely in a drive at the finish. BLUE WILDCAT was bumped by a neighboring rival at the start and was away a step slowly,
recovered to be prominent in the early stages and stalked the quick pace into the turn, advanced two to three wide into the turn and pressed the pace to the
quarter marker, was repelled into the stretch and re-rallied into the final sixteenth, could not reel in the winner in deep stretch and held for second at the
finish. REBALATION was unhurried leaving the start and was content to trail in the early stages, raced two wide to the quarter marker, maintained that two
wide path into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, finished well into the final sixteenth, was up for third in the final strides and just missed for
second at the finish. TAMARA MINE broke alertly and vied for the lead away from the start, ceded the early lead to BABY KRISTEN and stalked that rival
through decent fractions heading into the turn, saved ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the
stretch and chased to the furlong pole, raced within aim into the final sixteenth, could not muster a final response in deep stretch and just missed for show
honors. NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) was forwardly placed away from the start, tracked the early pace from between runners then pulled on the rider passing
the half-mile marker, raced between rivals into the turn and came in a bit tight approaching the quarter pole, swung three to four wide for the drive, offered a
mild late rally but needed more in deep stretch. TESSA (GB) was away from the gate a bit slowly, tracked the solid early pace from the inside then shifted
outside of runners heading into the turn, improved position into the bend and went three to four wide at the quarter marker, raced widest into the stretch and
came five wide to the furlong pole, could not muster the needed response in the final sixteenth and was outkicked.

wide at the quarter marker, battled for the lead into the stretch, continued that fight while on the left lead into the final sixteenth, switched leads and wore

marker, battled between rivals into the stretch and vied for the lead at the sixteenth-marker, fought gamely into deep stretch and was outfinished by the

holding a narrow lead at the furlong marker, continued to fight while holding a narrow advantage at the sixteenth-pole, was overtaken by the top pair in deep

while between runners, lost position into the turn and chased two to three wide to the quarter pole, maintained a three wide path into the stretch and
re-rallied at the furlong marker, was unable to impact the top three in the final sixteenth but was gaining late. WINNING LOVER ducked in at the start,

Footnotes
SENOR DEL CAMPO broke out and made contact with RESERVE PROOF then was forced into WEE BEASTIE as part of a chain reaction initiated from the
outside, settled and was content to race at the back of the field to the far turn, started to rally once past the three furlong marker, swung five wide into the
stretch and produced a bold rally, inhaled the field and won going away under a brisk hand ride. RESERVE PROOF took a bump from SENOR DEL
CAMPO after the break then got crowded and forced into that same rival as a result of the incident to the outside, moved over to the rail when clear then
pulled the rider hard to vie for the lead, took command passing the six furlong pole, rated kindly while keeping clear of the chasers, quickened and opened
up when VENOM made an early challenge after passing the seven-sixteenths marker, came into the stretch two lengths clear, opened up again and tried to
hang on under steady handling but could not hold off the winner while finishing well clear of the next horse. MOVIETIME took up in traffic well before the first
turn, then went three to four wide through the turn, settled near the back along with THANKS MAGGIO (ARG), moved forward with that rival through the far
turn but ran into a wall of horses from the five-sixteenths pole then had to alter course when several of those stopped in mid-stretch, found a hole, surged
through and was able to gain the third spot. THANKS MAGGIO (ARG) stumbled coming out of the gate then got floated four wide on the first bend but pulled
forward through the clubhouse turn, continued to race wide down the backstretch in mid-pack, improved some through the far turn then came under
pressure from the quarter pole, was kept to task and managed to pass a few in the late stages. HAVAKASH READY got pinballed after the break, showed
good speed from the outside, raced close up three wide while under some restraint to the half mile mark, was let loose on the turn and moved into
contention, was the outside horse in the trio chasing RESERVE PROOF but tired mid-stretch. VENOM veered out after the start and bumped with
HAVAKASH READY then overcorrected and veered in causing a chain reaction of bumps with MOVIETIME getting the worst of it, got inside position early
and raced close up in a tracking position, made steady gains on the leader down the backstretch and was poised to challenge passing the half, came up the
rail and was on the inside of the trio trying to catch RESERVE PROOF then weakened under pressure in the final furlong. CENTRE CIRCLE broke outward
and made light contact with WEE BEASTIE then was hustled forward and secured the lead into the first turn, offered no resistance when RESERVE PROOF
took over the lead at the six furlong marker, continued to race close up between horses chasing that one to the far turn, tried to rally with three furlongs to
run, proved no match for the top two but held position with the tracking group to mid-stretch then tired. WEE BEASTIE took a light bump at the start then
was not asked for speed early on, saved ground through the first turn, made a little forward progress down the backstretch then struggled to keep up on the
turn and faded.

Footnotes
EVERYDAYISSATURDAY allowed to settle in the early going, was roused entering the turn and improved position four wide at the quarter marker, loomed
into upper stretch and battled for the lead approaching the furlong marker, took command past mid-stretch and drew to a clear lead into the final sixteenth,
pulled away under hand urging in the late stages and was much the best. UNBRIDLED RHYTHM was forwardly placed away from the start, stalked the solid
early pace and was well positioned heading into the turn, came in tight while between runners at the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch and
remained boxed in nearing the furlong marker, found room past mid-stretch, was not able to impact the winner in the final sixteenth but stayed on well into
deep stretch and was up in the final strides for second. RUNNIN UTE broke alertly and was a bit keen away from the start, settled and ceded the early lead,
tracked the quick pace heading into the turn and gained ground three wide approaching the quarter marker, assumed command into upper stretch and led
to the furlong marker, was overtaken past mid-stretch, could not match strides with EVERYDAYISSATURDAY into the final sixteenth and was nailed on the
wire for place honors, while holding safely in the end for the show. GRAND SLAM KID was crowded leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered
and tracked the quick early pace from the second flight, raced between rivals into the turn and gained ground while in tight approaching the quarter marker,
angled four wide into the stretch and continued his bid at the furlong marker, could not muster the needed late response and was outkicked in deep stretch.
VALIANT SON hopped at the start and was away a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the solid early pace from the inside, saved ground into the turn and
improved position at the quarter marker, was blocked into upper stretch and gained ground while navigating traffic approaching the furlong pole, could not
sustain his run into the final sixteenth and flattened out in deep stretch. EFFORT hard sent away from the start, was prominent in the early running and
stalked the quick pace heading into the turn, kept close attendance to the pacesetter along the bend and pressed two wide to the quarter marker, vied for
the lead into upper stretch, was outkicked at the furlong grounds and gave way in the final sixteenth. EL GOLOSO was carried out a bit by a neighboring
rival at the start, settled off of the solid early pace, maintained an outside position into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter marker, trailed into the
stretch and did not factor in the late stages. MR. DUFF was hustled away from the start, assumed command of the early running and showed good speed
heading into the turn, carved out solid fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch and faded in the final furlong.
