FIRESPITTEN KITTEN showed good early foot to be clear while crossing over, dug in late and prevailed under strong handling. LEGEND OF GOLD chased
the pace from the inside, angled out four wide and finished gamely to the wire. GOIN OWEN was off slowly, swung five to six wide and closed with good
energy. ONE LUCKY BOY was hustled along two deep and weakened a bit in the drive. SHOTCRETE dropped back to race mid pack, was two to three
wide and needed more. PROOF OF PURCHASE raced three wide and lacked a response. YUTAN TAPIT was off slowly and trailed.

BIG MONEY MACHINE stalked the pace, made a four to three wide bid and prevailed under strong handling. CELERITY settled off the early going, made a
bold four wide bid through the far turn and kept on gamely to the wire. SCOTTY WHO stalked the pace, raced three deep and kept on to the wire.
SEGOVIANA showed good early speed and faded in the drive. OUTLAW X. was shuffled at the break, saved ground and never threatened. SABER
STORM was hard sent and gave way. LETSTAKEITOUTSIDE stalked the pace and was done early.

Footnotes
MENDHAM MILL quick to begin to set the pace and held well to prove best under strong handling. FINISHWHATUSTARTED pressed the pace three wide
from the outside of foes and finished gamely to the wire. SWEETNESS TO swung four to five wide into the lane and finished gamely to the wire.
BLOOMING HILLS chased the pace from the inside and weakened. CAL'S GIRL hustled from the outside, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and
had not enough. QUALITY BOW dropped back early and failed to respond. POPS GIRL ALEXA showed little. HOT CAVIAR was injured and had to be
vanned off.
