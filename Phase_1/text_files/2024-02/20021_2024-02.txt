Footnotes
MERASOL SUGAR away in good order, showed the way off the inside through the first turn, continued to set the pace, dropped to the inside into the far
turn, extended advantage into the stretch, remained well clear to the wire under steady handling. HAPPY HAPPY unruly in the gate prior to the start, broke a
step slow, lacked speed, advanced into contention three wide through the final turn, chased the winner through the stretch, managed little in the way of a
late gain. CHELSEA PIER behind the pace while saving ground, continued inside, moved out a bit around a ring rival to be in the two path for the drive,
finished up best of the rest. BUSINESS AS USUAL four wide into the first turn, chased the winner up the backstretch off the inside, dropped inside late in
the final bend, had little left for the stretch run. RUBY QUEEN closest to the winner early while saving some ground in the first turn, fell back a bit after the
half then tired further in the drive while three wide into the lane. HAUNTED DREAM fell back to trail after the start, four wide first turn, again through much of
the second turn, made little impact through the stretch, ridden past the wire. K'ANTHEIA in mid pack while racing off the inside, gave way late in the final
turn.

Footnotes
PUNCHY GIRL away well, set the pace in the two path, rated through the turn, drew out through the stretch while being kept to task late. WAR MUSIC
pressed the winner early from along the inside, continued to head up the second flight while saving ground, no match for the winner stretch, proved game
for the place. SHE'S STORMING brush start, in the second flight outside, three wide through the turn, also had little for the winner stretch, outfinished late
for the runner up spot. SHUTUP PLEASE bothered when put in tight at the start, bump, lacked speed outside, four wide into the stretch, went evenly to the
wire in lacking a closing response. JERI DAWN off a step slow, saved ground through the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat.
NAVAGATIONALBEACON bumped at the start, recovered to race in the second flight while between horses, weakened in the drive. THURSDAY
MORNING got out at the start, lost iron, raced in the second flight early, faded.

Footnotes
BOOTH in the second flight along the inside and within striking distance, crept a bit closer late in the turn, waited in traffic into the lane, tipped out a bit, split
foes when straightened for home, drew clear under confident handling to win ridden out. LET'S GO MARK pressed the pace three wide, two path when still
forcing the issue, bid into the stretch, could not match the winner the final furlong, drew clear for the place. FROST FREE in the second group early off the
inside, pulled hard while in traffic with over a half remaining, came three wide for the drive, up for show, no threat to the top two. ANDY'S CANDY last away,
lacked speed, four wide into the stretch, improved position a bit, not a real threat. CEEPEEGEE moved outside early, moved closer three wide late in the
turn, flattened out in the drive. TEXAS TOWN broke on top, set the pace toward the inside, gave way when headed in upper stretch. MAKE IT SPEND IT fell
back to trail, was never a threat.

Footnotes
RIVETAGE outrun in the early early while saving ground, continued to lag inside onto the backstretch, began to advance in the second turn, got through
every jump into the lane, challenged inside the leader and proved determined to be best. YOU'RE ON MUTE void of speed, advanced into contention four to
five wide turning into the stretch, lost considerable ground to the winner into the the stretch as a result, could not get to the winner late while up late for the
second spot. GOLDEN PLATE keen early under stout restraint, continued in hand up the backstretch, bid, took over entering the stretch, weakened a bit
late after being headed by the winner with less than a furlong remaining, caught for the place final strides. GREERS FERRY off a step slow, moved up off
the inside to race in mid pack, improved three wide into the stretch, flattened out a bit in the late going. AMBIGUOUS moved out, four wide late first turn,
continued outside, four wide through the second bend, lacked a serious response in the drive. MIDNIGHT TIL DAWN broke on top, showed the way first
turn in the two path, continued to show the way toward the inside, weakened when headed. QUEBRANCHO in mid pack while along the inside, continued to
save ground second bend, lacked a closing response. PRINCE IS MY BOY void of early foot off the inside, three wide into the lane when still well back,
passed tiring rivals without making an impact. COUNTY JUDGE in the main group early, was finished after a half. EQUATE prompted the issue up front in
the three path for six furlongs and backed up. WITHOUT OBJECTION dueled early off the inside, stopped second turn.

Footnotes
MANTA REY asked along while outrun early, four wide through the turn when making a mild advance, set down when straightened for home, in time wide
widest in the drive, finished with good resolve to be up in time. ROCKING ROCKET broke sharp, set the pace inside, continued to narrowly show the way
past the furlong marker, dug in and proved stubborn to the end. ABSOLUTE CHAOS behind the pace along the inside, moved out a bit from behind the
runner up into the stretch, bid past the furlong marker, outkicked late while between horses. BACKSIDE BUZZ forwardly placed off the inside, moved closer
in the three path turning into the stretch, challenged a furlong out, not enough late while also between horses at the wire. CACTUS pressed the runner up
early outside that one, chased through the turn and began to weaken entering the stretch. BOAT SONG off a step slow, made little impact in remaining
back. BOBWHITE BOBBY failed to menace while racing in the two path. TRIPLE ELVIS raced in mid pack in the two path, had nothing for the drive.
FOREVER COOL trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
BLACK APPLE last to leave, saved ground first turn, moved out and advanced four wide late in the second bend, challenged the leader from the outside
nearing the furlong marker, edged away from that one under firm handling. LIPS SAY BLISS stalked the pace while three wide, advanced and took over on
the outside turning into the stretch, responded while drifting out when the winner challenged nearing midstretch, lugged in soon after then could not keep up.
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE tracked the pace from along the inside, in some traffic late in the final turn, clear for the drive, no match for the top two. ZAP
MOTION pressed the early leader, dueled the middle part in the two path, weakened in the drive. WHAT'S UP DOC went one paced throughout while racing
off the inside. HARLEEZY dueled early along the inside, showed the way up the backstretch and into the second turn, gave way when headed by the runner
up entering the stretch, continued to back up.

Footnotes
STORY HOUR broke on top, set the pace along the inside while rating, clear into the lane, expanded that advantage past the furlong marker, kept to task in
keeping the runner up safe latee. INSENSITIVE lacked speed while three wide, moved closer closer four wide late in the final turn, lost some ground to the
winner into the lane, slowly getting back to the winner late, well clear for the place. LET'S DUET void off speed just off the inside, continued in the two path
into the far turn, steered out to be four wide into the stretch, proved no match for the top two in the drive while well clear of the others. MY GOOD FORTUNE
fell back to trail after the start, continued to lack speed, two to three wide final turn, improved position in the drive without posing a real threat. FLASHY
LASS broke in air, back early, rank, moved closer then was forced to check up in tight quarters with a half mild to run, continued in traffic second turn, gave
way in the drive. MARSHSIDE MAMA forwardly placed while off the inside, three wide when a bit closer far turn, had nothing left for the drive. HONEY RUN
in the second flight along the inside, continued to save ground second turn, backed up through the stretch. JUST LIKE MAGIC pressed early, dueled the
middle half, gave way late in the final turn, trailed home.
