Footnotes
THIRTY CARATS pressed the pace from outside to the stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and dug in late to inched ahead for the victory. HENNYS
CRAZY TRAIN took control quickly and moved inside, set the pace under pressure from THIRTY CARATS, maintained a short lead to the sixteenth pole
and yielded grudgingly late. IRISH PATSY sat off the pace outside a rival, moved closer in the middle stages, spun three wide into the lane, rallied between
foes in the stretch and missed second. MYFAVORITEDAUGHTER lifted her head slightly and came away slow to spot the field a few lengths, trailed on the
inside around the clubhouse turn, gained three then four wide on the far turn, finished well while widest in the lane but got outkicked. CORNELIA FORT
stalked in the two path outside a rival to the stretch, moved out in upper stretch, chased within striking range entering the final sixteenth but lacked room
late. KLEEN KARMA settled along the rail, moved closer up the backstretch, waited for room on the far turn, came off the rail and kept trying to the wire.
MADIHA pulled chasing behind the leader early while on the inside, stalked in hand up the backstretch, saved ground through the far turn and lacked a bid
in the furlong grounds.

Footnotes
BIG CITY LIGHTS brushed with MYSTIFICATION leaving the gate, stalked outside a rival up the backstretch, came under a ride two to three wide on the
turn, chased after HOPKINS into deep stretch, drew alongside and got up at the wire. HOPKINS stepped to the front from outside then crossed over once
clear of inner rivals, showed the way two wide into the stretch, led clear to the sixteenth pole, challenged by BIG CITY LIGHTS shortly after and got nailed
on the line. SEE THROUGH IT tracked in range off the inside, rounded the bend three to four wide, chased within range with a furlong remaining but lacked
the needed late kick in deep stretch. MYSTIFICATION brushed with BIG CITY LIGHTS at the start, forwardly placed in the early going from inside, lost
ground while still racing along the fence around the bend and could not rally in the final furlong. THE BIG WAM trailed along the inside then two wide into
the lane, moved out in the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
EL REY DORADO antsy in the gate, cleared and steered to the two path, set the pace up the backstretch, tested from outside on the far turn, responded
nicely to the left hand by shaking free from SPEED GRAZY in upper stretch and drew off under steady handling. SPEED GRAZY stalked five wide into the
first turn outside rivals then steered over to the three path around the bend, closest in pursuit of the pacesetter into the far turn, challenged from outside,
failed to kick on with the winner in upper stretch and churned on to secure second. CALIFORNIA BAY stalked between rivals three then two wide early,
angled four wide on the far turn and gained the show honors. DIVINE FEMININE stalked the leader from the rail, roused into the second bend, asked right
handed and tipped three wide around the turn but lacked the needed response in the stretch. SHIP AND SCAM unhurried in the beginning and moved
inside, trailed to the far turn, shifted to the two path on the second bend and passed tired rivals. CRYPTO RIDE stalked three deep around the clubhouse
turn, chased outside a rival leaving the backstretch, entered the lane three wide and weakened. KERRY GOLD fractious in the gate, keen early when
reserved along the inside then moved a bit off the rail on the clubhouse turn, roused at the quarter pole, cornered nicely into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CAN'T SLEEP broke in and bumped rival, sat off the pace early then moved closer leaving the backstretch, rounded the bend three then four wide, reached
the front outside the eighth pole and drove clear. RUNAMILEINMYSHOES forwardly placed from inside, shifted out at the three-eighths pole, tipped two
wide at the quarter pole, got crowded a bit with a furlong left to run, gained a clear path and rallied for second. JANE KENDEIGH brushed leaving the gate,
forwardly placed outside a rival then applied pressure past the half-mile pole, took over with a quarter mile remaining, lost command in upper stretch and got
outkicked for second. BEAUTIFUL JANET chased well off the rail early, bid three deep on the turn, drifted in a bit in upper stretch and flattened to fourth.
GIRLCANTHELPIT came away slow, ran awkwardly over the dirt, trailed three wide into the turn, spun four wide into the lane and improved position.
SPARTA F. C. stalked from inside, tried to go between rivals but lacked room in a tight spot at the quarter pole, altered back to the rail, steered out in upper
stretch and lacked a rally. ANOTHER SUMMER chased from off the pace in the early going, took the turn two then three wide, ran into traffic in upper
stretch, altered out past the eighth pole and failed to menace. NATURALLY BLONDE chased off the rail then had the rider took hold past the
nine-sixteenths pole when running up on heels, bothered by inner rival and steadied at the three-eighths pole, came three wide into the stretch and
weakened. ENVISIONED bumped between rivals at the start, went up to take control then angled in once clear, pressured past the half-mile pole, lost
command at the quarter pole and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
KINZA established the front quickly and led two to three wide into the clubhouse turn before moving inside, felt some pressure from KOPION to the outside
early on the far turn before inching clear again, showed the way in the two path entering the lane, asked right handed at the top of the stretch and remained
clear to the wire. KOPION stalked four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, drew alongside KINZA at the seven-sixteenths pole, lost with that rival with a
quarter mile remaining, remained close entering the furlong grounds but could not summon the needed late kick. SHE'S A TEMPEST stalked in the two path
then moved inside, continued to save ground through the far turn while coming under a ride, chased within range at the eighth pole, failed to summon the
needed response but finished a clear third. NOTHING LIKE YOU chased along the rail, moved off the rail on the backstretch, rounded the second bend two
to three wide and weakened down the lane. GREAT FORTY EIGHT chased three then two wide early outside a rival, traveled three deep into the far turn,
dropped back to last and angled to the inside around the bend and also weakened.

EXULTATION settled three deep early, moved into the two path around the bend then tipped out into the lane, rallied to the front past the sixteenth pole,
drifted out and bumped BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) near the wire and won the bob on the line. BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB) got bumped back at the
start, trailed two wide into the turn, angled out and came five wide into the stretch, closed in from outside, took a bump from EXULTATION near the wire and
lost the bob. HOT BOX up close early and had to steady when running up on heels behind the leaders, stalked from inside around the bend, tipped two wide
into the stretch, angled out further in the lane, rallied between rivals but got outkicked by the top pair. GIVE ME THE LUTE stalked the top pair up the
backstretch, bid three deep into the lane, gained command in upper stretch, lost the advantage past the sixteenth pole and yielded late. SILARDI dueled for
the lead from outside then chased ATOMIC DROP into the turn, challenged again at the five-sixteenths pole, fought between rivals into the lane, then
weakened in the late stages. ATOMIC DROP dueled for the lead from inside then cleared SILARDI on the backstretch, met the challenge from that rival
again on the turn, fought inside a pair of rivals into the lane and weakened. KANDEREL broke in and bumped, chased between rivals then two wide into the
turn, moved over to the rail once clear of inner rival, steered back out in the lane and flattened. RAGING WATERS traveled four deep out of range early,
chased three deep on the turn, four wide into the lane and weakened. SLEW'S JOY off slow from inside, chased inside rivals into the turn, got put in a bit
tight at the three-eighths pole, tipped out into the stretch and failed to menace after. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
EXULTATION FROM FIRST TO SECOND FOR DRIFTING OUT NEAR THE WIRE AND MAKING CONTACT WITH BARRISTAN THE BOLD (GB),

ENJOY IT STRAIT tracked off the rail or outside a rival into the turn, angled out and spun five wide into the lane, rallied from outside and got up at the wire.
SPIRITUAL ADVISOR bumped inner rival early, stalked from inside into the turn, tipped out into the lane, challenged from between rivals in upper stretch,
took over midstretch and got caught on the wire. MINISTER SHANE sat off the pace, traveled two wide on the turn then came three wide into the stretch,
angled down to the inside and gained the show. HONDO CROUCH broke a bit slow in the beginning, traveled on the inside at the back into the turn, three
wide turning for home, angled out in the lane and summoned a mild rally to complete the superfecta. BAG'S GOLD raced in range three to four wide and
needed to find more in the final furlong. SAULS CALL sent to the front and steered to the inside once clear of inner rival, met the bid from outside challenger
at the five-sixteenths pole, resisted to midstretch, then relinquished the lead and faltered in the final sixteenth. SOUL OF MIDNIGHT showed speed inside
the pacesetter then took hold early, remained closest in pursuit into the turn, challenged from outside again at the five-sixteenths pole, spun three wide into
the lane and weakened in the furlong grounds. WEGONAHAVAGOODTIME took a bump and steadied when losing path early, traveled two wide at the back
into the turn, moved over to the rail around the bend and proved no menace. HEY MEL chased four wide near the back into the turn, moved into the two
path around the bend, came three wide into the lane and made no impact.

MISSED THE CUT rated along the inside through the early going, drew closer on the far turn still patiently handled, cut the corner into the lane, launched a
rail bid and gained command in upper stretch, then drew clear from the runner-up in the final sixteenth. PLANETARIO (BRZ) settled at the back and steered
inward, drew closer in the middle stages, continued to save ground around the far turn, angled out and bid four deep while getting bumped in upper stretch
and got outkicked by the winner in deep stretch. BALLADEER stepped to the front and crossed over to the inside, showed the way with a comfortable lead
up the backstretch, unchallenged to the quarter pole then was confronted by IRISH PROPHET past the marker, drifted out and bumped that rival in upper
stretch and relinquished the lead to MISSED THE CUT, no match for the top pair in the late stages but kept on to save third. IRISH PROPHET closest in
pursuit in the early stages, traveled along the rail to the far turn, moved out and launched a bid in the two path past the quarter pole, got knocked into outer
rival by BALLADEER in upper stretch and got edged for the show honors. EASTERN OCEAN traveled near the back off the rail then moved inside, gained
in the two path on the far turn but flattened out in the final furlong. SHORTMAN reserved early outside a rival, rounded the far turn three then two wide and
failed to respond when asked. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY, THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED BALLADEER FROM THIRD TO FOURTH FOR DRIFTING
OUT AND MAKING CONTACT WITH IRISH PROPHET IN UPPER STRETCH, COSTING THAT RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
GRAND TIGER pressed the pace from outside, headed the leader at the five-sixteenths pole, took over at the quarter pole, cleared inner rival in upper
stretch and held well in the end. GOLF DRAMA chased the top pair up the backstretch, navigated the turn three wide, finished willingly through the lane but
could only whittle the gap on the winner while picking up the place honors. MISTER BEAMS chased outside rivals four wide into the turn, remained in the
four path turning for home and summoned a mild rally for a clear third. QUAGMIRE MAGIC chased in the three path entering the turn, exited the bend two
wide and needed to find more in the furlong grounds. TIGER'S ARROW traveled two wide off the pace into the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
improved position. EAGLES LANDING raced in mid-pack up the backstretch, saved ground through the turn, went between rivals late but could not
threaten. VINNY THE COIN set the pace under pressure early, headed midway around the bend, lost command at the quarter pole and weakened in the
furlong grounds. ROAD OF LOVE stumbled at the start, raced near the back two wide leaving the backstretch, angled out and came four wide into the lane
and failed to menace. ROGUE SON trailed five wide into the turn, six wide into the stretch and was never a factor. TOLEDO ROCKET hit the gate and came
away a bit slow, chased five deep into the turn, remained wide into the lane and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
STAY AND SCAM vied between early then was overtaken by PRINCESS BETTINA entering the turn, closest in pursuit from the two path through the turn,
drew alongside the leader at the top of the lane, inched ahead in upper stretch and drew clear in the final sixteenth. PRINCESS BETTINA chased briefly
then rushed up outside the top trio and cleared approaching the turn, crossed over to the inside, showed the way to the top of the stretch and was
confronted by STAY AND SCAM, relinquished the lead shortly after and stayed on to secure second. KITTY KITANA (GB) stalked from inside out of range
on the turn, moved out and came three wide into the lane, chased within striking distance at the furlong marker but lacked the needed late kick in deep
stretch. CUSTOMER LIST (FR) trailed early, moved to the rail for the turn, entered the lane two wide, showed a mild response when roused and earned a
minor award. THRUMPS DREAM (IRE) bobbled leaving the gate, tracked out of range two wide into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked a
rally. ALTERNATE ROCK vied three deep early, chased outside rivals three to four wide around the turn and flattened in the late stages. FREE AND
HUMBLE vied inside a pair of rivals for a bit then chased after the new leader entering the turn, saved ground around the bend and also flattened down the
lane. BELLA D unhurried in the beginning, went two wide around the bend, angled out leaving the bend and came five wide into the stretch and was never a
factor.
