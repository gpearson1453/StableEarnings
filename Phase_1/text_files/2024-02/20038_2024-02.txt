Footnotes
UNCAPTURED FAITH stalked the pace to the far turn, rallied three wide to take command midway on the bend and drew clear, unthreatened in the lane.
PEARLINTHEROUGH tracked the leader down the backside, responded when called upon to rally down the stretch with a mild bid to gain the place. MIMI'S
HOLIDAY unhurried for the first half mile to be at the back of the field, made a steady advance through the turn and in the stretch to grind her way to the
show. MYRA FLEENER hustled away from the gate to take the lead into the first turn, widened her advantage down the backside to be on a clear lead and
weakened in the stretch drive. IMA SURE BET reserved to mid-pack along the fence into the final bend and failed to mount a closing rally. FABIOLA
PRINCESS contended into the far bend in striking distance and failed to respond when called upon. BEING CREATIVE was never a factor.

ONE MORE CHAPTER tracked the dueling pacesetters down the backside while well rated, rallied three wide on the far turn to take command turning for
home, drew clear in upper stretch and held well to the wire. HIDDEN ACCESS pressed the pace throughout, dueled on the final turn for the lead, had no
answer when engaged by the closing winner in upper stretch and kept-on down the lane willingly to be second best. OUR BUCKWHEAT set a pressured
pace from the insice while under steady restraint from his rider, dueled through the turn on the lead and had no response when called upon turning for
home. MONSTER HUNTER posed no threat while showing some late interest. CLEVELAND POWER was not a factor having been outrun.

MUTUAL CONFIDENCE stalked the pace to the turn, rallied three wide to engage the leaders in upper stretch, dueled down the lane and prevailed in the
final strides. HE'S THE SOUPERWON dueled on the lead from two wide the entire trip, edged away from the inside rival turning for home, responded when
immediately challenged by the circling winner and battled gamely to the wire only to be denied late. KOSCIUSZKO pressed the pace from the rail to duel on
the lead to upper stretch and kept on willingly through the lane while out-finished late in the drive. PERFECT WAGER tracked the pacesetters from the
fence to the turn, was set to a long drive and steadily advanced through the stretch. GILLIGAN reserved off the pace to midway on the bend and circled six
wide to be gaining late in the lane. BEACH FRONT failed to menace. TWO GUNS never threatened.

I STRONG settled off the early pace, gained ground in the turn to be close up, waited behind rivals turning for home, angled out four wide to the clear in
upper stretch andf wore down his rivals coming home. CAVALETTO stalked the pace into the turn, circled four wide to engage the leaders at the head of the
lane, took control opening a clear lead and was caught nearing the wire. REIGNING DREAM pressed the early pace to the turn, took the lead under
pressure to the quarter pole and kept on down the lane finihsing the best of the rest. RAY'S EMPIRE tracked the leaders to the three-eighths pole, rallied
three wide to loom large at the top of the lane and weakened in the stretch drive. YIPPEE KI YAY showed brief speed to take the lead and was through
early. MR. BALI was never a factor. THE RIDER OF RAY'S EMPIRE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST CAVALETTO FOR INTERFERENCE TURNING FOR
HOME, UPON REVIEW THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
T MONEY bobbled at the start, was taken in hand to settle off the early pace, circled the field to be nine wide rallying at the head of the stretch and closed
well to be up in time. SIR AGGRAVATOR dueled on the lead from the inside under constant pressure, surrendered the lead briefly nearing the quarter pole,
responded to reclaim the lead in upper stretch and was caught in the shadow of the wire in a game effort. SUDDENLY SEDUCTIVE reserved off the pace,
rallied eight wide on the turn and continued to rally willingly through the stretch. COMPASS POINT unhurried early to trail, mounted a rally midway on the
bend and finished well down the lane while working his way through traffic. CRIMSON ROCKET stalked the pace to the turn, rallied four wide to engage the
leader at the quarter pole, battled in the lane to be prominent and weakened inside the sixteenth pole in a good effort. PATIO PARTY well placed tracking
the leaders, rallied from between rivals turning for home to loom in upper stretch and flattened out late in the drive. MR. TRIPLEDOUBLE squeezed at the
start to be at the rear of the field early, moved up to contention into the turn and finished evenly. BEYOND MY DREAMS prompted the epace from two wide
and failed to respond when called upon in the turn. HONOR LIFE chased the leaders from four wide and tired in the lane. TWICE AS SMART prominently
palced down the backside and was through early.

Footnotes
PRIVATE DRIVE tracked the leader through the turn, rallied four wide in upper stretch and closed well to be up in time. THEDAYOFTHEGREY set the pace
on a well rated, well measured lead, opened the advantage in upper stretch repelling the early challengers and was caught on the wire. VISUAL MISSION
reserved off the pace to the top of the stretch and was gaining late with a belated rally. HENRY THE CAT stalked the pace to midway on the turn, made a
bid to challenge nearing the quarter pole and was out-finished in the drive. DOUGS MORNING PICK rated in mid-pack and lacked a closing rally. GIV'EM
THE BIZ failed to menace. CALBOYZEKE well placed to prompt the pace in the turn and faded coming home. VICTORY DIVISION was not a threat.
SIMON SAYS bumped and crowded leaving the gate to trail, angled way wide for the run down the backside and was never a factor having lost interest and
chance at the start. PER RULING ECM2024-12 FROM HIWU, PRIVATE DRIVE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 1st TO UNPLACED FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
CIRO THE BOSS broke outward awkwardly leaving the gate, was taken in hand to settle off the pace down the backside, steadily gained ground on the
bend, ralied four wide to close well and be up in time and going away at the line, and returned injured. PROSECUTOR stalked the early pace, moved three
wide to engage the pacesetter on the turn, battled with that one through the lane, edging to the lead inside the sixteenth pole and was out-finished by the
fast closing winner in deep stretch. EAGLE NEST dueled from the inside from midway on the turn, exchanged the lead several times and finished willingly in
a good effort having done all the dirty work. PALACE TEMPTATION tracked the early pace, lost position on the turn, was set to a long drive and found best
stride late to be gaining in deep stretch. COLOR BEARER trailed to the top of the lane and passed weaker rivals in the stretch. HOTROD BOBBY went
evenly lacking a closing response. FLAG RAISER prompted the pace for a half and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
NUBLADA prompted the early pace down the backside, rallied two wide on the bend to take command, quickly drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out down
the lane while much the best. WILD MARIAH set the pace to the turn, responded when challenged, was no match fro the winner and kept on willingly to hold
the place. STICK AROUND tracked the leaders to the top of the lane, angled well wide turning for home and showed good late interest to be gaining late in
the lane. OLYMPIC WINGS stumbled badly at the start and lost all chance. COLLECT GOLD stalked the pace to the top of the lane and faded in the drive.
WHATDID I BUY trailed and was never a factor.
