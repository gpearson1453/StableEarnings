Footnotes
NORTHERNREFLECTION took multiple bumps from an inner rival at the start ,laid off of the pace along the inside, took closer order up the rail down the
backstretch to stalk behind the top pair around the far turn, took aim outside of them turning for home, bid in upper stretch then drove past in the final
sixteenth. TSURIS was reluctant to load, then turned his head just before the gates sprung and broke multiple lengths slow, trailed along the inside,
launched a rally turning for home before tipping to the four path entering the lane, and sustained progress to reach place in the shadow of the wire.
SARAH'S VISION was restless in the starting gate, set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals, disposed of both of them before meeting the eventual
winner's challenge in upper stretch, gamely held an advantage into the final sixteenth but was bested late and got nailed for place. JUJU NINETEEN tracked
from just a bit off the inside, pursued between horses down the backstretch, chased among foes around the far turn, got floated to the five path entering the
lane and lacked a bid. FORT BONZ pressed five to three wide around the first turn, vied two wide around the far turn, but yielded between horses entering
the lane and gave way on his left lead. J B GRAY vied three to two wide and between horses around the first turn, failed to sustain pressure and chased
between horses approaching the far turn, got floated three to six wide entering the lane and faded. QUARTER RAT was brushed by an inner rival soon after
the start, tracked from midpack in the four path, retreated to trail down the backstretch and made little impact. SIR OVERANALYZE leaned out and bumped
an outer foe multiple times at the start, tracked in the three path and between horses, but faded in the four to five path around the far turn.

Footnotes
CYPRESS GOLD showed the way outside of a prompting rival while getting floated to the five path by that one into the first turn, recovered to tuck to the two
path around that bend, shook free and built a clear margin with a half mile to go, widened that advantage in upper stretch, but began to tire entering the final
sixteenth and just lasted from an outer on-charging bidder at the wire. EMILY'S BOY settled off of the pace along the inside, swung out to the seven path
entering the lane, rallied to take aim on the clear leader in the final sixteenth, sustained progress to threaten late but narrowly came up short. BRADFIELD
BABY tracked along the inside, pursued before shifting to the five path while between horses entering the lane, drifted outwardly in midstretch and ran on.
TEMPLE OF PEACE laid off of the pace three wide, got floated to the six path entering the lane and stayed on mildly. REGATTA BAY tracked tucking two
wide around the first turn, pursued between horses approaching the far turn, but steadied and faltered entering that bend, got floated inwardly entering the
lane, then improved past outer rivals in the closing stages. MISTERHOLYROLLER broke a step slow, trailed in the two path before moving out to the five
path with five furlongs to go, offered an early advance at the half mile pole to gain place and chase the clear leader from the four path around the far turn,
but weakened in midstretch and faded on his left lead. RED ROCK SOLUTION pursued from off of the pace two ide and between horses, lacked progress in
the four path around the far turn and failed to factor. KICKIN CHIP prompted along the inside of the leader but bore to the four path entering the first turn,
recovered and tucked to the inner railing around that bend, stalked down the backstretch but chased the clear leader into the far turn and faded turning for
home. FREDDIE BY A NOSE stuttered a step at the start, lacked speed in the three path, trailed along the inside around the far turn and was ourun.

Footnotes
MISCHIEF'S MACHINE saved ground off of the pace, rallied on his left lead shifting to the five path and between horses leaving the three sixteenths pole,
bid outside of the leader while changing leads at the sixteenth pole and edged past. SAILOR CHOW was lightly brushed between horses early on, stalked
the leaders from the three to four path, bid and gained an advantage in upper stretch, inched clear at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer bidder
in the late stages. DESOTO'S WAR lacked speed in the two path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, chased whlie hanging on his left lead
through midstretch, yet changed over entering the final sixteenth and offered a late kick for show. TWO DOT chased along the inside, entered the lane in
the two path, vied for show with outer rivals through the final furlong but got outfinished. JRUE BREEZE laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted to the
five path entering the lane, floated to the six path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over entering the final furlong yet only offered a
mild kick between horses. SMOKIN RICHIE was bumped by an outer rival at the start, recovered to duel for the lead inside of that one around the turn, led
into the lane but was headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and weakened late. COURAGEOUS TIMMY trailed in the two path and failed to factor.
GLENN'S JUMPER was restless awaiting the start, then bumped an inner rival upon leaving the gates, dueled for the lead two ide around the turn, but
weakened in the three path and between horses entering the lane. GALLANT BUCK lacked speed in the three to five path and caved.

NILES CHANNEL broke awkwardly while being bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, saved ground pursuing from midpack, moved out to
the six path whlie picking up stride between horses at the three sixteenths pole, rallied to bid outside of the leader while shifting inwardly entering the final
sixteenth, sparred through the late stages and prevailed. OPTIMUS KAT stalked along the inside, ranged up tipping outside of the leading pair turning for
home, but drifted to the five path entering the lane, hung on his left lead in upper stretch, changed over whlie attempting a bid at the furlong grounds, forged
an advantage as an outer rival menaced entering the final sixteenth, battled through the late stages but got outfinished. OPTIMAL COURAGE set the pace
along the inside, dueled with an outer prompter around the far turn, forged ahead hanging on his left lead in midstretch, changed over leaving the furlong
grounds, but was caught by an outer pair entering the final sixteenth and fought on but was bested. NOBRAG JUSTFACT tracked from midpack two wide
and between horses, entered the lane in the five to four path and ran on among foes. SMOKEY HARBOR pursued from midpack four wide, fanned to the
seven path entering the lane, and ran on one-paced. OF THE MOMENT prompted two wide, dueled around the far turn, but yielded between horses in
midstretch. AFLEET ASCENT stalked three wide, chased around the far turn, but floated to the six path entering the lane and faded between horses.
CHAOSMOS was off a step slow and bumped an inner rival at the start, raced off of the pace under firm restraint in the five path around the first turn, then
laid well back in the three path around the far turn and made little impact. ONE TIME GEM lacked speed along the inside, trailed in the two path around the
far turn and never got involved. CHARLIE G broke slowly and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide early on and was outrun.

SURVEILLANCE tracked the embattled leading pair from the two to three path, took aim outside of them entering the lane, bid in upper stretch before
forging an advantage passing the furlong marker, and edged ahead in the late stages. KAVOD dueled for the lead two wide through an arduous pace,
sparred between horses as an outer rival offered a bid in upper stretch, led very briefly before being headed by that outer challenger passing the furlong
pole, fought on doggedly to sustain the battle through the late stages, but was denied regaining even terms. WILLTORUN trailed along the inside, moved
forward while brushing to the four path and between horses nearing midstretch, gained show and chased willingly through the late stages. MARSALIS
dueled for the lead with an outer rival through taxing fractions, but gave way nearing the final furlong. MORELLO broke a step slow, pursued from off of the
pace in the three to four path, but gave way once brushed to the five path approaching midstretch.

DEBT PAID stalked along the inside, slipped through a wide rail seam to gain an advantage nearing the five sixteenths pole, shook clear shifting out
entering the lane and drew off under a drive. MAP TO THE STARS pursued the main group two wide into the turn, swung out to the six path at the five
sixteenths pole before checking to alter course back inwardly nearing the lane, then rallied between horses to gain place at the wire. KING OF THE
PALACE bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked four wide, got outmoved by an inner rival while getting floated to the five path around the turn, kept
on in pursuit through the final furlong, attempted a late bid for place, but was outfinished by an inner bidder at the wire. NOBLE EAGLE was slow into stride
and trailed early on, picked up stride in the two path turning for home, swung out to the eight path into upper stretch, then offered a belated rally to miss
reaching show. BALTIMORE HEART was reluctant to load, then broke a step slow, tracked along the inside, followed the eventual winner's rail move
turning for home, gained place taking aim outside of that one entering the lane, but only managed to chase in upper stretch, faded entering the final furlong
and lost place late. PATRIARCHAL laid off of the pace three wide, moved down to the two path nearing the lane and chased thereafter. LOST IN THE
SAUCE broke slowly, lacked speed in the three to four path around the turn, trailed entering the lane and made little impact. SHERIFF JOE bumped with an
outer rival at the start, stalked in the the three path and between horses, but was floated to the four path by the bearing leader around the turn, then gave
way approaching the lane. BRONTE DIEM showed the way in the two path, but bore to the three path as an outer rivals pressed entering the turn, came
under a right handed crop to prevent further lugging around the bend, then weakened between horses nearing the stretch.

Footnotes
DONCHO bumped with an inner rival at the start, prompted outside of the leader and from the three path into the turn, gained an advantage while traveling
well in hand entering the lane, responded readily and drew off once set down in upper stretch, then widened under a drive leaving the furlong grounds.
CATS BY FIVE bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the four path, inched closer to striking range entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with
the clearing leader before edging place at the furlong grounds, and kept an inner bidder at bay thereafter. BEAR RIVER stalked along the inside, slipped
through to offer a rail place bid in midstretch, but was outkicked passing the furlong grounds, persisted on but was fended off for that position. HONKY
TONK HIGHWAY tracked two wide and between horses but lacked a bid. SHOGUN BE FAST showed the way inside of a prompting foe while a path off of
the inner railing around the turn, proved no match for his outer counterpart entering the lane and weakened between horses. QUARRYMEN laid off of the
pace in the two path, moved out to four, then six, path in upper stretch but lacked a rally. AGOO trailed while lugging to the six path entering the turn, bore
wider entering the lane and was outrun.

OVA CHARGED vied for the lead with an outer rival while a path off of the inside, shook clear of that one turning for home and drew off under vigorous hand
urging. OEUVRE was put to crowded quarters by an outer foe and forced to bump an inner rival early on, tracked three wide, moved out to the six path in
upper stretch, rallied to gain place nearing midstretch and was second best. REDIFINED rated well back in the three path, swung out to the seven path
entering the lane, rallied in hopes of bidding for place passing the furlong grounds, but was turned away for that position entering the final sixteenth.
BREEZE EASY (GB) laid off of the pace in the two path, entered the lane in the four path, tipped to the six path in midstretch and ran on. POPPY FLOWER
was bumped between horses and squeezed among foes early on, raced at the rear in the three path, shifted to the six path entering upper stretch and
moved up. DANA'S BEAUTY lacked speed along the inside, moved to the five path in upper stretch before altering to the eight path in the final furlong, but
made little impact. JUMPIN JUDY chased closest to the top pair and from the three to two path into the turn, then gave way. BRANDON'SMYLAWYER
bumped an outer rival early on, tracked along the inside and faded. SWEET TEMPERAMENT vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but yielded
turning for home then weakened in the five path and between horses leaving upper stretch.

PRETTY ANA leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe while in the three path, got headed by that one turning for
home in the two path, yet fought back to regain an advantage passing the furlong grounds and inched ahead late. MISCHIEVOUSNESS prompted the
leader from the four path, vied and dueled with that one while taking the far turn in the three path, forged a narrow margin turning for home, but relinquished
the advantage back to his inner counterpart at the furlong grounds and was turned away. MONTCLAIR ROAD pursued from midpack in the three path,
inched closer while chasing in the four path around the far turn and and achieved show in upper stretch. CHURNING BERNI laid off of the pace just a bit off
the inner rail, then ran on while one paced. OH MY MIA lacked speed two to three wide and failed to menace. OSTERVILLE PUBLIC was brushed by an
outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased in upper stretch and faded. STERLING LUCK bumped the outer part of the starting gate upon
leaving it, trailed early on, then between horses around the far turn and made little impact. LOOKING FOR GINNY hopped at the start and broke slow, then
saved ground well back but to no avail. FASTA LAVISTA BABY stalked outside of the top pair and from the five path, but faded around the far turn.
