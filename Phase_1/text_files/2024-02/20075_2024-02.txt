CAJUN BLAST pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and faded down the home stretch. DAY JO lacked early speed, had a wide trip, moved up,
but was no factor. BOBULINSKI lacked early speed and was never a threat. DEFIANT MALICE pressed the early pace and dropped back. CAPITAN

entered the stretch four wide, dueled to the wire and was outfinished for the win. BROKEN HEARTS BAY lacked early speed, moved up, outside around the
turn, made a wide rally and finished willingly. NANA'S CORN MUFFIN raced near the middle of the field, saved ground around the turn, showed late
interest, but was no factor. RUNNING ARGUMENT lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. CALABRIAN QUEEN dueled for the early
advantage and faded. AFRAID IM NOTCENTS showed early speed and dropped back. EXPECT A DANCER challenged on the front end and made a
steady retreat. LITTLE E always raced in the back and showed little.

Footnotes
ANN'S STORM unhurried in the beginning, moved up between rivals around the final turn, angled to the inside down the stretch, rallied down the rail and
proved the best late. LIL ADEAU vied for the early lead, drove clear around the final turn, lacked a late kick and couldn't hold off ANN'S STORM for the win.
SIMPLE SUNDAY lacked early speed, made a steady gain, but proved no match for the top two. SOPHIE'S PRAYER pressed the pace, racing five wide
around the first turn, moved up down the backside to challenged LIL ADEAU for the lead, weakened and was no threat late. BRI void of early speed, raced
wide around the second turn, showed late interest, but was no factor. KNIGHTS SWORD pressed the early pace, saved ground and faded. HOLY WAR
lacked early speed and was never a threat. SCRAPBOOK raced within striking distance and faded. BETISON raced in the middle of the pack and retreated,
while finishing wide. MADISON'S SCREEN raced within contention and dropped back.
