Footnotes
SEIZE THE GREY settled in the second flight off the inside, ranged up three wide to challenge late in the final turn, vied between horses past the furlong
marker, edging away end under firm pressure. MAXIMUS MAGIC dueled up front in the first turn off the inside, clear before a half, responded when
challenged in the second turn, raced on equal terms wityh the winner past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner late, narrowly gained
the nod for the place. FOOTPRINT back off the pace and the inside, advanced and challenged four wide turning for home, battled past the furlong marker
while widest of the first flight, could not match strides with the winner late, missed the nod for the place. IMPERIAL GUN last away, trailed early, moved a bit
closer four wide entering the stretch, went flat late to finish up evenly. MIKEALICIOUS settled in mid pack while inside, saved ground, steered out in the two
path turning for home, made little impact through the stretch. GEWURZTRAMINER dueled early along the inside, chased the runner up the second quarter
then began to weaken. BLOWN COVER prompted the issue three wide, lodged a brief bid on the outside midway on the second turn, faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
EXCITABLE BOY forwardly placed while three wide and being asked, continued to be encouraged through the turn, challenged on the outside turning for
home, edged away past the furlong marker and drew well clear in the run to the wire. RUN JALEN RUN broke forwardly, pressed into the turn, challenged
between horses into the lane while inside the winner, unable to keep up with that one the final furlong, remained clear for the place. MO EL GRANDE broke
awkwardly, raced back early as a result, dropped to the inside for the drive, rallied up the rail to annex the show. DAILY GRIND lacked early foot, came four
to five wide out of the turn when improving a bit, failed to sustain that advance the final furlong. STRONSINO well back off the pace while along the inside,
steered out three wide turning for home, improved position without posing a serious threat. GOLDEN BUZZER within striking distance while racing four
wide, continued in the four path through the turn, came up empty for the stretch run. SIR OTTO broke on top, set or forced the pace along the inside for a
half, gave way when straightened for home. ROCKY TOP MISCHIEF broke back, five to six wide out of the turn, remained back through the stretch in
lacking a response. ANOTHERBOTTLE in mid pack for a half while toward the rail, backed up through the stretch. RYNO WRECKER tired while racing
three wide most of the way.

Footnotes
MOTOWN DYNAMIC broke on top, showed the way while lightly restrained in the two path, continued to set the pace turn, extended advantage in upper
stretch, remained comfortably clear to the wire while being kept to task. BELLOFTHEBLUEGRASS forwardly placed along the inside, crept a bit closer
inside the winner late in the turn, proved no match for that one through the stretch, well clear of the rest. BANG BANG FURY in mid pack and in the two
path, had little for the top two in the drive, best of the rest. VINOBELLO void of speed, came three wide for the drive, displayed a modest amount of late
interest while not a serious threat. HAVAHA restless in the gate then was off a step slow, devoid of speed in trailing toward the inside, steered out four wide
into the stretch, improved position. PEWTER'S PROMISE off a step slow, raced inside, failed to muster a rally. CRUISE MISSILE forwardly placed off the
inside in the second flight, tired through the stretch. BROWNIE BAY in the main group while outside early, four wide turn, also tired in the drive.

Footnotes
FAVORITE OUTLAW never far back while outside, four to three wide early in the turn, challenged on the outside into the stretch, drove steadily clear.
BRESLAU away well, set a pressured pace inside, moved out a bit into the lane when vying with the winner, proved no match for that one the final furlong,
proved game for the place. W W SCOUT'S HONOR forwardly placed while outside, three to four wide turning for home, lacked a winning kick, outkicked late
for the place. LATE NITE RADIO forwardly placed inside, continued to race within striking distance while saving ground, also was found lacking in the late
going while continuing inside. MR. THUNDERSTRUCK void of early foot, dropped toward the inside turn, improved while inside of horses, no real threat.
LAKE RADIO back off the pace while inside, shifted out for the drive, went evenly to the wire. EFFICIENCY broke back, well back while off the inside, three
wide into the stretch, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. SINNER'S SIN in mid pack and four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally when called on
for the drive. COLD AS HELL pressed the pace from between horses, weakened after a half. SPEIGHTSVILLE crowded just after the start, raced back and
four wide through the turn, remained back. GUNFLASH off a step slow, remained always back. UNRAPTURED staged a steady retreat while racing three
wide.

Footnotes
MIDSUMMER MARCH in the second flight while three wide early, continued in the three path up the backstretch and into the far turn, challenged outside the
two leaders late in that bend, stuck a head in front entering the stretch and kicked clear. HAPPY TALK lacked early foot, continued unhurried the middle half
mile, steered out to be four wide entering the stretch, brushed with TAP THE CHAMPAGNE past the furlong marker and kicked clear of that one for the
place. TAP THE CHAMPAGNE asked for some run early to maintain position, saved ground first turn, moved closer into the far bend, shuffled back along
the inside in traffic soon after, got through upper stretch, brushed with the runner up a furlong out, finished up best of the rest. WHO'S TICKET broke alertly,
allowed the leader to go early, pressed that one onto the backstretch, advanced and challenged far turn, put a head in front between calls entering the
stretch then began to weaken from between horses and inside the winner. MY FAVORITE GIRL veered out at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths,
continued to trail early, three wide second turn angled in late in that bend when beginning to move, staged a belated rally to improve position. ENIGMATIC
moved up to set the pace into the first turn, clear onto the backstretch, continued to show the way far turn then gave way when headed with a quarter
remaining. CATHOLIC SUE broke back, void of any early foot, picked off a few tiring horses after the issue had been decided. HER BEST FRIEND in the
second flight early toward the front, began a steady fade after a half. OFF THE LAM off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack early before falling back.
PEPPERS GIRLFRIEND in mid pack much of the way, had nothing for the drive. SAFECRACKER SUE finished early, trailed well back.

Footnotes
POLTERER broke forwardly, pace oft the inside, responded when confronted by the runner up in the far turn, long duel to the wire, dug in late to prove best
in game fashion. UNDERHILL'S TAB forwardly placed, pressed three path, bid far turn, dueled through the stretch, outkicked. SUN THUNDER four wide in
the first turn, mid pack, continued outside, closer four wide second turn, continued a steady advance through the lane, slowly getting to the top two late.
COSMO in mid pack off the inside, in some traffic in the second turn while remaining in the two path, improved slightly into the lane, went evenly to the wire.

ALOHA BABY pinched back after the start, fell well back, made a smart advance along the inside through much of the turn, swung out five wide around
traffic into the stretch, finished a willingly second while not a threat to the winner. AURORA GEE away in good order, pressed the winner for a half from the
outside, could not keep up in the drive not contain the runner up, saved the show. KAVA brushed early, mid pack in the two path, improved position down
the stretch without posing a serious threat. QUEEN MALLARD in the second flight while racing three wide, lacked a closing kick. ERUMPENT void of speed
early, moved inside turn, passed some tiring foes while not a serious threat. SNOW FLURRY four wide and with the main group turn, lacked a response in
the drive. LADY RAZORBACK had little left while racing toward the inside. CLASSY EDGE forwardly placed for a half toward the inside, backed up. LINNIE
MAE in mid pack along the inside, tired through the stretch. PRESLEYS TURN was never a threat. PETIT JEAN dwelt at the start, was used to move up
rapidly into the turn while keen, stopped in the stretch, jogged in.

not match strides with that one late, stayed on to remain clear for the place. MUCHO MACHO GIRL forwardly placed in the second flight inside, continued to
stay in contact of the leaders while saving ground turn, lacked a closing kick when called on for the drive. I'M THE BOSS OF ME moved up to duel into the
turn, alternated through the bend, first to blink into the lane. ADALINE JULIA lacked speed inside, remained back while continuing to save ground turn, two
path into the lane, continued one paced through the lane in lacking a rally. LET'S BE CLEAR off a bit slow, trailed for a half, improved inside of horses into

Footnotes
LEMON MUFFIN settled off the pace and the inside, three wide onto the backstretch, continued in the three path when advancing under a light hold late in
the final turn, set down for the drive in the four path, challenged then exchanged bumps with the runner up past the furlong marker, kicked strongly clear of
that one under steady handling. TAPIT JENALLIE forwardly placed while outside, stalked in the run up the backstretch in hand, advanced, challenged
midway on the second turn, showed the way into the lane, bumped with the winner midstretch, proved no match for that one, held the place. WEST OMAHA
in tight just after the start, in mid pack while racing off the inside, called on for run in the three path late in the final turn, responded with a mild rally to
capture the show. NEOM BEACH in the second flight early, continued to rate behind the first flight, eased out for some room in some traffic in the second
turn, roused between foes nearing midstretch, lacked the needed closing kick. MIDSHIPMAN'S DANCE one paced while four to three wide first turn,
continued in mid pack and outside, came four wide for the drive, mild late interest to be gaining for the show spot late. BAND OF GOLD void of speed along
the inside, moved out a bit into the far turn, swung five wide turning for home, improved position a bit without making a major impact. IN JUST MY HEELS
dueled up front off the inside, put that foe away just as the runner up was coming alongside midway on the final turn, second duel, gave way in the drive.
EDISTRUDIS broke alertly, dueled up front along the inside, first to blink into the far turn. HONOR CAT lacked speed along the inside, remained always
back. ALYS BEACH off a step slow, trailed throughout to be always outrun. FOLLOWING A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RUNNER UP AGAINST THE
WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN MIDSTRETCH, THE RESULT WAS ALLOWED TO STAND.

Footnotes
OCTANE broke on top, relinquished the advantage into the first turn inside, moved out, stalked that leader up the backstretch, advanced and challenged
second turn, dueled into the lane, put that rival away then had enough left to hold the runner up safe late. MAGIC TAP forwardly paced in the two path,
continued in a crowded second flight through the final turn, roused for the drive, slowly getting to the winner late while drawing clear for the second spot.
NOTARY within striking distance outside, lodged a three wide move to challenge late in the final turn, dueled with the winner outside that one into the
stretch, weakened the final furlong, saved the show. BOLZY four wide in the first turn when well off the pace, continued outside, three to four wide second
bend, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position. O P FIRECRACKER settled off the pace and the inside, three wide through the second
turn, continued one paced through the stretch to lack a closing response. ESCAPOLOGIST last to leave, fell further back, continued to lag into the far turn
while saving ground, made a modest, belated run up the rail to improve position. SPEED BIAS moved outside in the first turn to be four wide, continued well
wide, five wide late in the second bend, failed to muster a response. U. S. ARMY void of speed, continued back second turn, behind traffic late in the final
turn, swung out six wide for home, lacked response. PROMISE KEEPER cleared early, showed the way for six furlongs toward the inside, faltered when
headed by the winner in the second turn. FROSTED DEPARTURE forwardly placed for five furlongs, gave way in the final turn.

Footnotes
TIMBERLAKE in the second flight early while between horses, three wide into the far turn, asked along midway on that bend, four wide bid into the lane, put
a head in front soon after, drifted out a bit, kept to pressure to edge away from the runner up in the late going. COMMON DEFENSE mid pack first turn
along the inside, continued to save ground while moving closer before a half, idled along rail second turn while covered up, got through along the rail to
lodge a challenge nearing midstretch, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner as that one was drifting then could not match strides, clearly second best.
NORTHERN FLAME away best of all, pressed the leader in the two path while between horses, continued to vie up the backstretch and into the far turn,
offered brief resistance to the winner upper stretch then could not keep up or contain the runner up, saved the show. WOODCOURT broke well from the
outside, continued to race in the first flight the middle half, came up empty when asked for more when straightened for home to finish up evenly. DIMATIC
back off the pace toward the inside, moved out a bit to be three wide in a group of horses into the stretch, went one paced to the wire. CARBONE took
command after a solid break inside, showed the way through some reasonable fractions along the inside, weakened when relinquishing the advantage
entering the stretch. JUST STEEL parked five wide through the first turn when off the pace, continued well wide in the run up the backstretch, once again
raced five wide through the second turn when moving a bit slower, went flat through the lane. NEXT LEVEL last to leave, lacked speed in trailing, continued
back second turn, came three wide into the stretch,improved position with some mild, belated interest. LAGYNOS in mid pack and three wide first turn, three
to four wide second bend, failed to rally. MAGIC GRANT remained always back in failing to menace. MENA in the second flight four wide in the first turn,
four wide again in the second when beginning to weaken, continued to fade stretch. TEJON PASS a bit restless in the gate, broke back, finished after a half,
trailed well back.

GIVE ME A REASON away in good order, set a pressured pace toward the inside, shrugged off a foe in upper stretch, responded when challenged from the
outside past the furlong marker, long drive to the wire, dug in late to narrowly prevail in game fashion. WILL TAKE IT settled off the pace, dropped to the
inside second turn, moved out, outside bid, dueled final furlong, outkicked in the late going. CHARLESTON settled off the pace just off the inside early,
made a mild advance four wide second turn, proved no match for the top two, clear of the others. YELL COUNTY prompted the pace from the four path
early, four to three wide second turn, came up empty for the drive. CRUSHED IT settled three wide and off the pace, four wide when advancing midway on
the final turn, challenged on the outside turning for home, hung in the run to the wire to lose several positions. P J'S SONG broke back, trailed early, three
wide through the second turn, improved position with some belated interest without posing a serious threat. GOTTA HAVE DREAMS lacked speed, in some
brief traffic far turn, angled out four wide turning for home, went evenly in the drive. GOD'S COUNTRY altered course when back into the first turn, dropped
inside second bend, lacked bid. THOUSAND SPRINGS off a step slow, well back, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a factor. SITKA in mid pack,
gave way in the stretch. CODE WORD pressed the issue for five furlongs, stopped far turn. SICILIAN DEFENSE flashed brief speed along the inside,
stopped before a half, trailed well back.
