DRIED PEPPER raced in the middle of the pack, made a bid, took the advantage down the home stretch, but couldn't match strides with the winner late.
WAR RON void of early speed, showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. MISTS OF TIME raced near the middle of the field, put forth an even
effort and lacked a kick. PARLAY PETE vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and faded. CODETOWIN raced near the back in the
beginning, had an outside trip, moved up around the final turn, entered the stretch wide, bled , dropped back and was vanned off. STREET ART challenged
on the front end in the beginning, dropped back and was eased to the wire.

Footnotes
SUNSET WAR dueled for the early advantage, took the lead around the turn, drove clear down the stretch and held on well for the win. DIAL UNCLE JOEY
lacked early speed, made a steady gain and finished willingly. FRIEND'S DO CARE vied on the front end, saved ground around the turn and lacked a late
kick. PALANTE void of early speed, made a late wide gain, but was no factor. ALL OF US raced within contention, came around the turn on the outside and
weakened. THA ILLEST DEAL always raced near the back and showed little. CUSTOM CRESCENT pressed the early pace, saved ground around the turn
and dropped back. PAL'S ALARM raced within striking distance, moved up around the turn, was pulled up down the stretch and vanned off.

on the front end, dueled throughout, proved no match late for the winner, but was a clear second. MAYFIELD STRONG lacked early speed, made a late bid,
finished wide and proved no match for the top two. BOY CHARLIE lacked early speed, came around the final turn on the outside, finished wide and showed
late interest. THREE GOLD PIECES void of early speed, saved ground around the final turn, made a mild bid, but was no factor. RUMPUSINTHESKY raced
within contention and weakened. MINOR DISCREPANCY showed early speed, saved ground around the second turn and faded. LOUDERMILK pressed
the early pace, came around the second turn on the outside and dropped back. TRIPPLE D RULLER raced in the middle of the field and faded.
