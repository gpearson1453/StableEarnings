Footnotes
A KISS FOR KHOZAN led the way up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and dueled gamely in the stretch to hold the win. TAKE
CHARGE CHLOE stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the bend and
dueled to the finish to narrowly miss. BEATIFUL KARLA tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and kept on to
the finish. ONE TOUGH DAME raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the early going, came around the bend in the two path and finished
evenly. PRETTY'N AWESOME chased the leaders between horses early, continued around the turn in the three and four path and was outkicked in the
stretch. WILD ARMY BRAT chased the pace setters between horses up the backstretch, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and
flattened out in the lane. MOOR STRENGTH raced off the pace through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the four path and never threatened.
BURN THE BREEZE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the stretch.
