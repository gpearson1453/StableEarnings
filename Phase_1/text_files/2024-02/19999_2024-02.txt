the lane. STREET GLIDE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the turn from the two path and chased on to
the finish. HIGH BROW saved ground early, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and kept on
in the stretch. LEAD OFF raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming
around the second turn and showed no kick. VINTNER raced in the two path around the first bend, tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch,
dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and faded further in the lane. SEICHE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside around the first

Footnotes
SOL HOPE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, began a bid in upper stretch, bumped
soundly with CADENCIA near the eighth pole and kicked clear from there. BAHAMIAN MOON chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved
ground around the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. COVENANT LADY raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the bend and improved position in the stretch. CADENCIA veered out and bumped with the horse to her
outside at the start, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the four path, came in at the
eighth pole and bumped with SOL HOPE and chased on from there. TRACY ANN'S LEGACY bumped with the horses to her inside at the break, recovered
to press the pace on outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on to the finish. JUMEIRAH raced off the pace on
the inside early, came around the bend in the four path and showed no kick. MERCY WARREN tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced
in the three path around the turn and weakened in the lane. NOEL'S ANGEL led the way on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the
two path and tired in the final furlong. ITSAKEYPER bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside early, came
around the bend in the four path and made no bid. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE STRETCH. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE
MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
