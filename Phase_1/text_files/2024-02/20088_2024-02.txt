SHARON'S PRINCE broke out sharply start, ran on wide to turn game to wire. PRINCE COLTON good position never far back to stretch, stayed on gamely
at wire. PRETTY FAST two path duel to deep stretch, outgunned in the late going. BRICKLAYER raced back with no speed throughout, never a real threat.
MY MAN FREDDY brief speed inside to duel, backed out into the turn and stretch. ONE FAST MIDDIE bothered from the gate and never threatened
thereafter. JUST GUS no speed to turn, four wide run past quarter pole, never close.

Footnotes
ATLANTIC STRIKE was patiently handled to the turn, ran on in the stretch to clear off the wire. BOTOX KATIE no speed to the turn with a steady stretch run
in a game effort for place spot. TWIRLING RUTH slow into stride with no speed to turn, revved up to close the gap and just miss place spot on the wire.
BEACH KITTEN speed to the front, held into the stretch, weakened in late goin. BANNED FROM MIDWAY awkward from the gate, trailed to the stretch,
improved position. PRINCESSTAPITURE never far back to turn with no response in the stretch run. ROLLESTON tried to keep up to the stretch, came up
empty and faded back. SHIP IT close up between horses to the turn with nothing left in stretch. QUEEN OF CHILL sharp break outside, good position to the
turn, gave way readily.

Footnotes
THE THUNDERER had a rail run around first turn while close up, ran on up the backstretch, blocked into far turn, got through and rallied along to be up on
the wire in a game effort. COAL BOSS wide run first turn while never far back, three wide into the far turn but outkicked in the stretch run. CASHMEUP was
pinched back from the gate, no speed to stretch, rallied at the eighth pole with a short lead but outgamed to the wire. LOLAS BEAU unhurried to far turn,
angled out to improve position in stretch while evenly late. CURLINS INCHARGE steadied along inside to quarter pole, bounced around with an
adventurous trip throughout and no chance. WELL SPOTTED speed to the front, challenged to quarter pole but used up and gave in readily. BOY
WONDER pressed leader to far turn with nothing left into the stretch run. AMERICAN RAIDER close up to the half, could not go on and faded from far turn.
