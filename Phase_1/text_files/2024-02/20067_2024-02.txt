CROSS CLAIM set a pressured pace while inside, was well handled then drew off in late stretch and was much the best. FAST TRACK chased the early
pace while two wide into the turn then raced evenly in the stretch and was second best. SHINING EXAMPLE was settled then rallied three wide in the
stretch but was no menace in late stretch. CRANKY SHEILA chased while inside then saved ground on the turn then made a bid but came up empty in late
stretch. SPACE PIRATE was unhurried early while inside then moved out to be four wide in upper stretch and was no threat. STARTECA was three wide on
the turn and was no factor.
