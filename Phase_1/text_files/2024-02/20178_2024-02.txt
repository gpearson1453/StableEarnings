READ THE ROOM prompted the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead near the quarter pole, was put to mild right handed urging past the three
sixteenths marker then finished full of run under a strong hand ride through the final furlong to win as much the best. PACIFIDERO stalked the early pace,
offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch and finished well clear for second. LEAVENWORTH close up along the inside, shifted outside at the top of the
stretch and passed a tiring rival. PEACEFULPERSUASION bobbled at the start, rushed to the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace for nearly a half,
kept on into the stretch and gave way late.

SHAOLIN unhurried early, rallied steadily four then three wide between horses, dug in late under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. MAMBO
KITTEN stalked the early pace, rallied two wide to make the lead at the three furlong marker, dueled the balance of the trip and just failed in a determined
effort. PRANCIPANTS trailed early, loomed boldly five wide into the stretch then was outfinished. CATALENA pressed the early pace along the inside,
dropped back on the second turn, came on again two wide under right handed urging through upper stretch but was outfinished. IRON BERTIE away alertly,
set the pace for six furlongs, battled along the inside until deep stretch then faded. LUCKY ROAD hopped at the start and was through after a half.
