Footnotes
WICKED TRICK pressed inside of the leader, prompted before vying around the far turn, forged an advantage in upper stretch and drew clear. ZAICI
showed the way staying in the three path around the first turn, felt pressure from an inner rival entering the backstretch, vied with that bidder around the far
turn, relinquished the advantage to him in upper stretch and gave way yet lasted for place. KEYS INCLUDED laid off of the pace in the three to four path
and ran on willingly but needed more to bid for place. HAMMERIN AAMER stalked in the two to four path while forwardly placed around the first turn, but
chased the top pair into the far turn, failed to keep pace while tucking to the inside around that bend, then tired. NATE'S REVENGE pursued from the two
path and faded. MILLARD'S SMILE bumped an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the two to four path and made little impact. MAX PANDOWDY was
bumped by an inner rival at the start, lacked speed in the four path early on and was outrun.

Footnotes
HARD FOUR brushed with an inner rival at the start, stalked in the three path, ranged up to bid in the four path entering the lane, drove clear in upper
stretch, was confronted by an inner challenger entering the final sixteenth and held. EL DEAL ME ACES prompted along the inside before stalking
approaching the turn, pursued from the two path into the bend along with an outer stalking counterpart, got outmoved by that one nearing the lane, kept on
to gain place at the furlong grounds, closed in to offer a bid inside of the clear leader at the sixteenth pole but was kept at bay. F T W SLAM broke a step
slow, laid off of the pace in the four path before fanning to the seven path into upper stretch, then stayed on outside of rivals to gain show in the final furlong.
FORTY THREE brushed with an inner rival before contacting an outer foe at the start, chased from midpack along the inside, pursued in the two path
through the lane and failed to menace. OURPERFECTPRINCE pursued from midpack in the four to five path and chased through the lane. HOOSIER
brushed an outer rival at the start, raced off of the pace in the two to three path and failed to factor. JOEY'S GAME trailed along the inside and never got
involved. HALF MAGIC set the pace two wide before clearing and tucking to the inside into the turn, got headed by an outer bidder in upper stretch and
weakened. HOLIDAY DIAMOND broke a step slow, lacked speed while kept in the five to seven path around the turn and tired.

Footnotes
BATTALION STRIKE brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked in the three path, took aim in the five path leaving the quarter pole, bid in midstretch,
forged an advantage at the sixteenth pole and edged clear. SPRINGTOWN dueled for the lead two wide, led in the four path entering the lane, met an outer
challenge in midstretch, dug in before getting bested by that one at the sixteenth pole, then lasted for place. CHASTE ONE trailed along the inside,
gradually shifted out while picking up stride in upper stretch, tipped to the six path entering midstretch, then rallied belatedly to miss reaching place.
CAPTIVATING STAR pursued from midpack in the two path, waited behind mild traffic entering the lane in the three path, then chased while hanging on his
left lead. LEISURELY stalked the embattled leading pair from the inside, took aim along the rail in upper stretch, but lacked a bid before giving way in the
final furlong. SUNNY SASSICAIA brushed with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed in the two path, but faltered position and trailed with five sixteenths to
go, then recovered entering the lane and moved up. GUS'S DREAM WORLD dueled for the lead with an outer rival, got headed by that one entering the
lane, then weakened between horses in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead. DR SPECK lacked speed in the four path, swung to the seven path
entering the lane and made little impact. SOCIAL SOLUTION raced off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path entering the lane and tired.

Footnotes
MISTER MULDOON brushed with an outer rival at the start, set the pace three wide, drew clear passing the three furlong pole, then drifted out while
widening under a drive in upper stretch. VORTEX lacked speed along the inside, retreated to trail turning for home, then recovered to offer a rail rally
through the lane and reached place at the wire. LIL BRO COOP pursued from midpack hung in the five to six path, sustained a chase to bid for place in the
closing stages but was outfinished by an inner bidder. WHISKEY AND EASY brushed with rivals on both sides at the start, prompted inside of the leader,
stalked before shifting to the three path into the turn, moved closer in the four path and between horses turning for home, wrestled place at the furlong
grounds but was bested by late bidders on either side. POINT AT YOU brushed an inner rival at the start, vied between the top pair early on, chased his
outer clearing counterpart passing the three furlong pole, clung to place from outer rivals through upper stretch, but lost at position at the furlong grounds
and faded. MAGIC MONDAY was brushed between horses at the start, tracked two wide, pursued in the five path and between horses turning for home, but
only managed to chase before yielding in the final furlong. CHARLIE'S CREED brushed with an inner rival at the start, trailed early on, moved out of last
between horses turning for home before shifting to the six path entering the lane and improved. BRONZE BEAST pursued from off of the pace in the three
to four path, moved in to the two path in upper stretch and made little impact. SERGEANT RECKLESS leaned out and brushed a foe at the start, laid off of
the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the lane and failed to factor. COME ON COME ON never got involved from the five to seven
path. RAMMER JAMMER pursued from midpack in the four path and between horses, but faded with three furlongs to go.

Footnotes
URBAN FORCE set the pace a bit off of the inner rail, repelled an outer challenge entering the lane, shook clear and held sway. NOBLE BERNADETTE
was pinched between horses at the start, settled well back along the inside, advanced three wide and between horses approaching and into the far turn,
moved down to the two path turning for home, sustained progress to gain place from an outer foe while in range of the clear leader in upper stretch, then ran
on to chase that one one. UPSWELL required an in-paddock shoe repair, bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack in the two path before
tucking to the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring rival turning for home, recovered and rallied between horses in the final furlong to reach show
late. PLAYMATE was bounced between rivals at the start, lacked speed in the three to four path early on, advanced along with an inner rival into the far
turn, tipped out to the five path in upper stretch, chased to gain show but lost that position lat. CAPELLA RED settled off of the pace two wide and between
horses, ranged up in in the five path around the far turn, but drifted wider in upper stretch and yielded. KAZILLION bumped an inner rival at the start, raced
towards the rear in the three path and between horses, took the far turn four wide before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up.
DEFAULT leaned in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked forwardly in the three to two path and between horse, attempted a bid nearing the lane, but
drifted to the four path entering the stretch and faded. SILENT SECRETARY (BRZ) bumped an outer foe at the start, raced off of the pace three to two wide,
then between horses around the far turn and failed to factor. SONG BRIDGE laid off of the pace along the inside, then three wide and between horses
around the far turn, fanned to the six path into the lane and made little impact. GATHER THE FACTS lost position looking to tuck in approaching the first
turn, retreated to trail leaving that bend and made no impact. RUTH OF JUDAH chased along the inside and weakened around the far turn. BIKINI
BOTTOM pressed in the four path but faded between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
OAK HILL LG set the pace along the inside, inched clear in upper stretch and held sway. HALF AGAIN tracked three wide, gained place and took aim on
the clear leader at the furlong grounds, but only managed to chase that one late and saved place from an outer bidder. DREWMAZING lacked speed in the
two path, swung out to the six path entering the lane, rallied to offer a bid for place in the late stages but missed. BIG BOO broke slowly, trailed in the four to
five path before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, and improved position late. HELAIRE was off slow, laid off of the pace four wide, then chased
evenly and lacked a bid. SONO pursued two wide and between horses, yielded position approaching the five sixteenths pole, swung out five wide entering
the lane and failed to factor. PINCH ME A PENNY chased along the inside and gave way. BIND FAITH broke outwardly, moved down to press outside of
the leader into the turn, but faded in upper stretch.

BIG TROUBLE stalked along the inside, smoothly took aim two wide and between horses entering the lane, bid in upper stretch and drew off. ZOE'S PRIME
dropped back soon after the start, lacked speed in the four path, fanned out to the seven path entering the lane and rallied to gain place late. MT. MASADA
was bumped by an inner rival before brushing an outer foe at the start, stalked close up two wide, got outmoved while floated three wide entering the lane,
kept on to edge place at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth. HUB CITY pursued from midpack along the inside,
shifted out to the five path and between horses at the three sixteenths pole, chased until changing to her right lead at the sixteenth pole and ran on willingly.
RENFREW showed the way along the inside, but offered little resistance to an outer challenge at the three sixteenths pole and faded. ALEXIS ROSE was
brushed by an inner rival at the start, tracked three wide, chased around the turn, fanned out to the six path in upper stretch and lacked a bid.
PROMDATEBONNIE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MY SOUTHERN GIRL leaned out and bumped a rival at the start, pursued from off of
the pace in the three to six path and failed to factor. LAUGHING OUT LOUD raced off of the pace two wide and failed to menace. BEAUTIFUL MISCHIEF
made little impact from the three path. GOLDEN DEGREE tracked four wide and weakened between horses. BAGEL AND DELI broke inwardly and
bumped the gate at the start, then lagged behind and showed little.
