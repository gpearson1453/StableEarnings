Footnotes
CEE'S THE IMAGE broke alertly, ceded the early lead and tracked the contentious pace from the second flight, gained ground two wide along the turn,
tipped four wide for the drive and vied for the lead into upper stretch, battled with MAX'S MAXINE into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch
and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. MAX'S MAXINE hit the gate at the start and was away a bit slowly, settled along the outside in the early stages
and maintained an outside path into the turn, chased three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and took a narrow advantage at the
furlong grounds, battled with CEE'S THE IMAGE into the final sixteenth, was outfinished in deep stretch and held clearly in the end for second. ROSE OF
JERICHO tracked the decent early pace from the inside, came in tight along the turn, tipped three wide approaching the top of the stretch and continued to
have traffic issues heading to the furlong marker, found room past mid-stretch, could not impact the top pair in the final sixteenth but ran on to be a clear
third at the finish. STEPHANIE'S CANDY was sent leaving the start, engaged with a pair of rivals and contested the decent early pace three wide heading to
the turn, took a narrow lead three wide at the quarter marker and led into the stretch, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker and was overtaken at
mid-stretch, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened. MIRAGE CODE showed speed away from the start, contested the decent early pace
inside of a pair of rivals, disputed the pace from the inside along the turn, lost position into upper stretch and tired in the final furlong. MAMARANDO was
forwardly placed away from the start, pressed the decent early pace while between a pair of rivals, battled between the leading pair at the quarter marker,
dropped back heading to the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages.

Footnotes
AFFECTIONTO AUTISM took back off of the decent early pace, saved ground into the turn and improved position heading to the quarter marker, shifted
four wide into upper stretch and responded to firm urging approaching the furlong marker, rallied past mid-stretch and confronted GONNA GETCHA GOOD
inside of the sixteenth-pole, pushed past the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. GONNA GETCHA GOOD stalked the decent
early pace, came two wide into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, was asked for run into the stretch and vied for the lead approaching the furlong
marker, assumed a narrow advantage at mid-stretch and led into the final sixteenth while kept to firm urging, was all out in deep stretch, was caught by the
quickly oncoming winner in the final strides and held for second. MR. T'S THIRSTY broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set a decent
early pace and drew to a clear lead heading into the turn, carved out moderate fractions while controlling the pace nearing the quarter marker, came under
pressure into the stretch, lost the lead at mid-stretch but continued to battle into the final sixteenth, was outfinished by the leading pair in deep stretch and
was clear of the rest for show honors. THUNDER OF ZION was hustled leaving the break and was forwardly placed in the early running, was asked to rate
approaching the turn and saved ground into the bend, angled three wide into the stretch and advanced at the furlong marker, needed more into the final
sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. SATANTA was unhurried leaving the start, saved ground into the turn, showed good late interest but was
unable to threaten in deep stretch. COOL MOUNTAIN LAD settled off of the decent early pace, chased two wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for
the drive and lacked a late response.

PROOF HE RIDES settled just off of the decent early pace, steadied while a bit keen nearing the seven-sixteenths marker and raced close up heading into
the turn, waited for racing room at the quarter pole and angled three wide into upper stretch, loomed at mid-stretch and was set down past the furlong pole,
was full of run nearing the sixteenth-marker, overtook HIGHLAND GHOST in deep stretch and held in a drive to prevail. TESORO rated off of the early pace
and tracked from the outside to begin, was well placed into the turn and stalked two to three wide nearing the quarter marker, mounted a four wide bid at the
furlong grounds and closed willingly into the final sixteenth, could not catch PROOF HE RIDES in deep stretch and got up for second at the finish.
HIGHLAND GHOST broke alertly, ceded the early lead to EVENEREVENWORSE and stalked that rival through solid fractions heading into the turn, kept
close attendance while two wide nearing the quarter marker, battled with EVENEREVENWORSE into the stretch and took command at the furlong grounds,
was all out approaching the sixteenth-marker, was overtaken by PROOF HE RIDES into deep stretch and was just edged by his stablemate for place
honors, while clear of the rest for show. EVENEREVENWORSE showed good speed away from the start, set a solid pace into the turn and carved out the
fractions heading to the quarter marker, battled with HIGHLAND GHOST into upper stretch, lost position at the furlong marker and gave way in the final
stages. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was allowed to settle away from the start while not far back, saved ground into the turn, swung to four path into upper
stretch and did not offer a late response.

Footnotes
RAFANELLI broke out at the start and was off a step slowly, was sent to assume command in the early stages and set the pace into the turn, controlled the
pace while well handled approaching the quarter marker, maintained a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth and held safely for
the win at the finish. THE GREAT HAYNES stumbled away from the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the moderate pace from the
inside, saved ground into the turn and was well placed at the quarter marker, maintained an inside path into the stretch and rallied at the furlong marker,
could not make headway on the winner into the final sixteenth and was second best. A DIME FOR ME took back off of the early pace, tracked between
rivals heading into the turn and chased three wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide into the stretch and ran evenly to the furlong marker, rallied into the
final sixteenth, could not impact the top pair in deep stretch and was up in time to secure show honors. CANAM GAL was a bit fractious prior to the start,
was away in good order and vied for the lead away from the start, ceded to RAFANELL and stalked that rival through moderate fractions into the turn, saved
ground into the bend and chased to the quarter marker, shifted two wide for the drive and ran evenly to mid-stretch, could not muster a late response and
outfinished for show honors. A ROUSING BABE tracked the early pace from the outside, raced three to four wide to the quarter marker, was outkicked into
the stretch and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. MISCHIEVOUS CURLIN was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the decent early pace and was
well placed heading into the turn, chased two to three wide at the quarter marker, lost ground into the stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
GALOPIN GOURMET broke alertly, ceded the early lead and was allowed to settle, chased two to three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the
drive and improved position at the furlong marker, closed fast into the final sixteenth, vied between rivals in deep stretch and won the nod on the wire to
prevail in a blanket finish. EDDIE CROSSWIRE came in a bit tight soon after the start, checked out of tight quarters and tracked the early pace from the
inside, saved ground into the turn then waited for racing room nearing the top of the stretch, found room into the drive and improved position nearing the
furlong marker, angled out past mid-stretch and carried out a rival in the process, closed with a rush in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while
securing the nod for place honors. JOHNNY PAYCHECK chased the early pace, was guided to the rail entering the turn and improved position at the
quarter marker, saved ground into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, made contact with MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE past mid-stretch and battled
into the final sixteenth, vied for the lead with a host of rivals and just missed for the win and place, while just holding for show honors. MISCHIEVOUS
PIRATE forwardly placed away from the start, took back in the early stages and tracked the pace from the outside heading into the turn, chased two wide to
the quarter marker, split rivals into the stretch and rallied nearing the furlong marker, came in tight past mid-stretch, bumped with JOHNNY PAYCHECK and
altered course into the final sixteenth, closed willingly in deep stretch, vied between rivals in the final strides and just missed for the win, place and show.
FORDY G was hustled away from the start, showed speed and assumed command of the early running, drew to a clear lead into the turn and set the pace
while off of the rail approaching the quarter marker, held a clear lead into the stretch and was kept to task to the furlong marker, drifted in a bit past
mid-stretch, dug in while holding foes at bay into the final sixteenth, met oncoming bids in deep stretch and was gamely bested at the finish. RESPOND
stalked the decent early pace from the outside, lost a bit of ground into the turn and chased three to four wide at the quarter marker, ran in pursuit four wide
into the stretch and lost ground at the furlong pole, re-bid into the final sixteenth, was forced out in deep stretch and was outfinished in the final stages.
DRUMADOON was prominent in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace between rivals into the turn, chased two to three wide at the quarter pole, lost
ground into the stretch and was outkicked at the furlong marker, came in tight past mid-stretch, took up off of heels nearing the sixteenth-marker and could
not muster a response in the final stages. THE RIDER OF MISCHIEVOUS PIRATE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST THE RIDER OF EDDIE
CROSSWIRE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. THE STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT EDDIE CROSSWIRE INTERFERED WITH
DRUMADOON PAST THE FURLONG MARKER AND IN DOING SO COST DRUMADOON THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. EDDIE
CROSSWIRE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED SEVENTH.

Footnotes
KINGMEISTER was prominent leaving the start, ceded the early lead to LAW ABIDING and stalked that runner into the first turn, attended to the moderate
pace through the backstretch run, went up to challenge LAW ABIDING along the far turn and pressed the pacesetter at the quarter marker, lost ground into
the stretch and chased to the furlong pole, re-rallied into the final sixteenth and closed determinedly in deep stretch, wore down LAW ABIDING in the final
strides and held in a drive to prevail. LAW ABIDING was away in good order and assumed command away from the start, showed the way into the first turn
and carved out moderate fractions into the backstretch run, set a prompted pace to the half-mile marker and was pressured into the far turn by
KINGMEISTER, shook free into the stretch and drew to a clear lead at the furlong marker, was kept to task while leading into the final sixteenth, was
outfinished by the determined winner in deep stretch and just held for place honors. FALSELY ACCUSED stalked the early pace, raced two to three wide
into the backstretch run and was well placed approaching the half-mile pole, maintained a two to three wide path into the far turn and chased to the quarter
marker, closed willingly into the final sixteenth and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. HONOS MAN unhurried in the early stages, raced
two wide into the backstretch run, improved position at the half-mile pole and was guided three wide into the second turn, gained ground approaching the
quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and lacked the needed late response. CHICKNFINGERFRIDAY was allowed to settle, saved ground into the
first turn and was content to trail into the backstretch run, saved ground into the second turn and did not factor in the stretch drive. GROSS PROFIT settled
off of the early pace while not far back, raced two wide into the backstretch run and improved position at the half-mile pole, saved ground into the second
turn and raced within aim at the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
AZURE STAR (IRE) broke very sharply and was hustled to the front, opened up a clear lead well in hand the backstretch while setting comfortable fractions,
began to get a little pressure after passing the half mile point, then quickened away when given the cue to go on, held sway through the stretch and won
well. BUENISIMO was a little slow to get into stride and was prompted early to keep position, raced mid-pack through the early stages, was put into an early
drive before passing the half, made some steady forward progress in the two path through the turn, had clear run into the stretch and continued to soldier on
to the wire and got up in time for the place. SUGAR BEETS had only one horse behind by the time the field turned onto the backstretch, took a four to five
wide path through the far turn, launched a bid from the five-sixteenths pole and finished willingly under strong handling down the stretch. BRONZE
WARRIOR showed good speed from the break, but ceded the pacesetting duties to AZURE STAR (IRE), settled well behind that one under a snug hold,
then pulled closer near the half-mile marker, was let loose then came under a ride before the five-sixteenths pole, was never able to make any headway on
the winner but finished well only to be passed for a minor award in the final yards. GALLANT WARREN broke outward at the start, then was unhurried,
taking up the last position through the first turn, waited to the five-sixteenths pole to launch a bid came six to seven wide into the stretch and finished well
under steady handling but had too much ground to make up. NUESTRO ENGREIDO was restless in the gate then was slow to begin once the gates
opened, got a good trip on the inside, gained ground on the rail through the far turn, loomed a big threat turning into the stretch, was still with a chance near
the eighth pole but could not find another gear when needed and finished evenly. KO SAMUI (IRE) lagged well behind in the early going, tried to launch a
bid with about three furlongs to run but was stuck behind horses to the stretch, found some running room two off the rail down the stretch and finished
willingly but needed more. TWIRLING DERBY got away well and was right behind the pacesetter through the first turn racing two wide, continued to track
the pace from close up three wide down the backstretch, did not go on when the pace quickened on the far turn and finished one-paced. YOU KIDDING ME
got inside forward position early, raced in the middle of the pack while holding the inside position along the rail, began to struggle to keep up on the far turn,
dropped back to last and chased the field to the wire.

Footnotes
CHELSIESDANZIGLITE broke awkwardly and made contact FINCAIRN at the break, then with was a little slow to get into stride and spotted the field a
head start, made steady forward progress through the turn, pulled even with the leaders three wide near the quarter pole then drew off under a brisk hand
ride to win going away. I AM AMADEO ducked inward at the start, dropped out of the early mix before the turn, swung four to five wide into the stretch and
re-rallied down the middle of the track and was along in time to gain second. REEF CITY was outrun early the started to run on when set down with three
furlongs to run, made a nice run on the rail into the stretch, tipped out to the four path for clear run then split horses willingly passing the sixteenths pole and
was still gaining round at the finish. SARK broke well then chased from mid-pack, held position through the turn had to check slightly to avoid getting
squeezed near the furlong poke then finished evenly. FINCAIRN took a light bump from CHELSIESDANZIGLITE at the break then checked a few strides
out, raced in the middle of the pack through the early stages, went three wide through the turn, was set down from the seven-eighths pole, was making
minimal progress in the stretch then was forced out and checked slightly just past the eighth pole to lose any chance. ATTA BOY LLOYD veered in at the
start to avoid contact with I AM AMADEO then rushed up to take the lead before a furlong was run, had WESTERN SIERRA shadowing to the outside but
held that foe at bay through the turn and into the stretch, had a short lead turning for home and ran on well before weakening in the last sixteenth.
WESTERN SIERRA broke best and had the lead in the early stages, was quickly joined by ATTA BOY LLOYD and opted to press that one from the outside,
tried to pull even after passing the five-sixteenths pole, found the rival stubborn and resilient, never got a head in front and faltered with a sixteenth to go and
dropped to last before the wire.
