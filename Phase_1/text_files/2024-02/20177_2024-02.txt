Footnotes
BARBSDREAMCOMETRUE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the bend from the four path and kicked clear in the lane. A
TOUCH OF HAIL pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, was caught late and
chased on to the wire. SHE'S SO SEXY was reluctant to load, bumped with the horse to her outside at the break, raced in the middle of the pack on the
inside up the backstretch, swung out to the five path coming around the bend and improved position from there. CALI CRUISER bumped with the horses to
both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace early, came around the turn in the six path and improved position in the stretch. ONE SPECIAL ACT bumped
with the horse to her inside at the start, recovered to track the leader between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the bend from the
three path and weakened in the lane. COUNTRY ECONOMICS led the way on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path
and tired in the stretch. INVIDIA DEL COCO trailed the field throughout, came around the turn in the two path and was not a factor.
