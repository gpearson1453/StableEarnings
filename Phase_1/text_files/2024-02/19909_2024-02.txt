and raced clear under the wire. DELIGHTFUL BREEZE pressured the pace through the backstretch and took the nod nearing the quarter pole, contested
the edge nearest the rail on the turn, dug in leaving the turn but was outfinished in the final yards, though, able to hold on to share second. MIDNIGHT

pressured pace through the backstretch, was met nearing the quarter pole, remained a close factor in the three path on the turn but flattened the final

PLAY IT LOUD gave chase through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the three path, angled to the outside leaving the turn, closed briskly through the
lane, got up in the final yards and was drawing further away toward the wire. BAYTOWN ADMIRAL set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail and
was steadily handled leaving the turn, but gave up the lead in the final yards. TAPPEDWITHSUCCESS exchanged contact with Hot Rod Love leaving the
gate and was bumped inward and into Cajun Joe then gave chase, raced at the rail on the turn and finished well to take the nod for third under the wire.
COOLKID engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn, flattened inside the sixteenth pole and was nipped from third the
final strides. CAJUN JOE came out and made contact with Tappedwithsuccess leaving the gate then pressured the pace, raced in the three path on the turn
then flattened in the lane. BESOTTED gave chase outside, rounded the turn about the four path and showed little in the lane. HOT ROD LOVE exchanged
contact with Tappedwithsuccess leaving the gate and never factored. LUCKY ROYAL FLASH gave chase toward the outside, showed no response leaving
the turn, sustained a fatal injury in the vicinity of the sixteenth pole and had to be euthanized on the track. There was a brief inquiry before this race was

Footnotes
XANTHE saved ground on the first turn, started her bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, left the turn at even
terms, took the nod toward mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. POLISH THE DIAMOND stalked two deep into the first turn, took the lead approaching
the half mile pole and rated the pace from that point, raced clear approaching the three eighths pole, came under pressure at the quarter, rounded the far
turn near the rail and dug in leaving the turn, but was caught mid-stretch and relented later yards. LONA LEE saved early ground then picked up the chase
leaving the three eighths pole, raced in range of the lead in the four path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. IHEARTRAINACOMN took a brief early lead
inside approaching the first turn, was met toward the half mile pole and gave chase from that point, dropped back nearing the three eighths and flattened
stride mid-stretch. LUCKY BOP settled in the two and three paths the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn
about the four path and could only close the gap in the lane. LONG LEGS LOUISE raced well back saving early ground and showed little response through
the backstretch. SCARLET REBEL rated close off the rail on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail
on the far turn.

JUDGEMENT DAY rated the pace inside, was hand ridden approaching the seven sixteenths pole, urged away at the rail on the far turn and finished of his
own initiative. DESTIN'S RAINBOW stalked two deep, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and proved no match.
BRADLEY DO RIGHT broke a bit awkwardly and rated off the pace about the four path the first turn, picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn and flattened in the lane. SEABROOK ISLAND steadied at the rail shortly after the start then saved ground well off the
pace, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole and improved at the rail on the far turn, but showed little more in the lane. LOVE IS WICKED raced
off the early pace inside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded in the four path on the far turn. GRANDPA JOE raced well back about the
three path the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. FAPPIANO HALO was not a factor. CANDY OUTLINE raced in the two and
three paths the opening turn then faded through the backstretch. UNDERBOSS raced about the six path on the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole but showed little response.
