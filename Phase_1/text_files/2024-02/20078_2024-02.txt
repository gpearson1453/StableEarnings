Footnotes
EDDIE CROSSWIRE rated nicely off of the decent early pace, was well placed approaching the turn and tracked the leading pair to the quarter marker,
angled three to four wide into upper stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker and took a narrow advantage at mid-stretch, responded to urging
and shook free into the final sixteenth, was kept to task under a firm hand ride into deep stretch and held safely in the late stages. DESCARTES took back
off of the contentious early pace and tracked from the second flight, checked out of tight quarters past the half-mile marker and lost position approaching the
turn, chased two wide to the quarter marker, slipped to the rail and loomed into upper stretch, raced within aim at the furlong pole, was outkicked by the
winner into the final sixteenth and held well for second in the final strides. SCHOCHOH was prominent away from the start, engaged with JEDI KNIGHT and
pressed that rival through decent early fractions, pressed the pace two wide to the quarter marker then battled into the stretch, vied for the lead into the final
sixteenth, was outfinished by the top pair in deep stretch and held safely in the end for show honors. DR PESCADO rated off of the decent early pace while
not far back, maintained an outside position into the turn and chased to the quarter marker, rallied four wide into the stretch and could not sustain that run
into the final sixteenth. JEDI KNIGHT was hard to load prior to the start, broke alertly and showed good early speed to assume command, set a pressured
pace into the turn, carved out decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, battled into the stretch, was overtaken nearing the furlong marker and
faded in the late stages. EL BERRINCHES raced close up to the decent early pace while between rivals, lost position along the turn, lacked a response in
the stretch and gave way. CARSON'S LEGACY bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, tracked the decent early pace from the outside, chased
three wide to the quarter marker, could not keep pace into the stretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
HORSE DOCTOR tracked behind the dueling leaders while staying out in the four path down the backstretch, launched a bid from the three furlong marker,
took command at the top of the stretch, drew away under steady handing and held clear despite drifting out to the center of the track in the late stages.
AWESOME DUDE tracked inside behind the speed, had to wait for running room on the turn, found none then tipped out to about the three path for the
stretch run, had trouble getting past HORSE DOCTOR in the stretch, who kept drifting into the path, finally ducked to the inside of that rival inside the
sixteenth pole but was too late. CONTINENTAL UNION broke alertly and was up with the leaders early, backed away from the duel near the five furlong
pole then re-bid for the lead at the quarter pole, battled briefly with HORSE DOCTOR but was unable to match strides with that one then got outkicked late
for the place. COUNTING CARDS broke well and was one of the first to the front, joined by MY SUNSHINE before going a furlong and dueled outside of
that rival through the turn, gained the advantage before the quarter pole then was taken on by CONTINENTAL UNION and HORSE DOCTOR, was unable
to go on with those and was outfinished down the stretch. LOLO PANIOLO broke well that was allowed to settle into stride behind the field, angled over to
the two path down the backstretch, was being asked for more on the turn but never found another gear and went even-paced to the finish. MY SUNSHINE
was reluctant to load, broke a beat slow, rushed up to engage COUNTING CARDS on the lead, dueled to the quarter pole, weakened and had nothing to
offer in the stretch.

Footnotes
KERRYGOLD LADY broke awkwardly leaving the start and was off a step slowly, settled off of the solid early pace, raced two wide into the turn, swung
widest for the drive and mounted a six wide rally into upper stretch, gained ground at the furlong marker and closed with a rush into the final sixteenth, took
command into deep stretch and edged away in the final stages. DADDYS NINA was prominent leaving the start, rated nicely off of the solid early pace and
tracked from the second flight heading to the half-mile marker, came three wide to the quarter pole, swung five wide for the drive and was asked for run into
the stretch, loomed at the furlong grounds, responded to urging and vied for the lead inside of the sixteenth-marker, could not match strides with the winner
in deep stretch and was outfinished, while besting the rest. HARBOR'S ROSE was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the solid early pace and kept
close attendance to DRAW NEAR approaching the turn, pressed the quick pace three to four wide at the quarter marker, took command into upper stretch
and was set down for the drive, held foes at bay to the furlong marker, was all out inside of the final sixteenth and was overtaken in deep stretch, was
outkicked in the final stages and held safely for show honors. AMANDA ROSE tracked the solid early pace from between rivals, lost a bit of ground into the
turn and chased two wide to the quarter pole, split rivals into the stretch and battled for the lead at the furlong marker, could not sustain her run into the final
sixteenth and weakened in deep stretch. DRAW NEAR broke alertly and assumed command away from the start, set solid early fractions while controlling
the pace into the turn, set the pace while two to three wide approaching the quarter marker, was overtaken into upper stretch, chased the leaders to the
furlong marker and tired in the late stages. WEGOTTODRINKING rated off of the early pace, saved ground into the turn and did not factor in the stretch.
SMOOVE AS SILK broke a bit slowly, rushed up leaving the start and stalked the solid early pace from the inside, was well placed into the turn, raced close
up to the solid pace while saving ground at the quarter marker, battled into upper stretch, lost position at the furlong pole and faded in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
EYELIGHT hard to load prior to the start, showed good speed leaving the start and assumed command in the early going, set a decent pace into the turn,
was well handled along the bend and showed the way to the quarter marker, was asked for more into the stretch and showed the way to the furlong marker,
dug in into the final sixteenth and determinedly lasted in deep stretch to prevail. ACCLAIMED PREACHER was forwardly placed away from the start, went
up and stalked the decent early pace into the turn, kept attendance to EYELIGHT while two wide at the quarter marker then chased EYELIGHT into the
stretch, could not get by the determined winner in the final sixteenth, was held at bay in deep stretch and was clear of the rest for place honors. BETTOR
BET'R away in good order, took back off of the decent early pace while not far back, tracked from the second flight and improved position three wide along
the turn, closed into the stretch, could not make headway on the top pair into the final sixteenth and held well in the end for show honors. BROOKYS GAL
settled off of the decent early pace and saved ground into the turn, maintained an inside path into the stretch, improved position at the furlong marker and
found her best stride late. SUPER ELLIE was unhurried away from the start, raced two wide into the turn, swung to the four path into upper stretch and
gained ground at the furlong marker, needed more into the final sixteenth but was gaining in the late stages. OUTER SUNSET broke alertly and vied for the
lead away from the start, ceded to EYELIGHT and stalked the decent early pace while between runners, lost position while two wide along the turn, was
outrun into the stretch and could not muster the needed late response. PRINCESS BELLE rated off of the decent early pace while not far back, lost ground
into the turn and chased three to four wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not threaten in the final sixteenth. GREATFUL
ATTITUDE raced close up to the decent early pace, tracked from an inside position into the turn and lost ground approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly
to mid-stretch and weakened in the final stages.

Footnotes
IMPERIAL HORNET sent leaving the start, assumed a narrow early lead and set solid fractions while prompted into the turn, set a pressured pace along the
bend and came two to three wide approaching the quarter marker, was confronted by GRIT AND CURIOSITY into upper stretch and battled with that rival to
the furlong marker, lost the lead at mid-stretch then came again and dueled into the final sixteenth, re-gained a narrow lead into deep stretch and
determinedly held in the final strides to prevail. GRIT AND CURIOSITY hustled to be prominent leaving the start, prompted the solid early pace outside of
IMPERIAL HORNET, kept close attendance to the pacesetter while three to four wide at the quarter marker, drew to even terms with IMPERIAL HORNET
into upper stretch and battled with that rival to the furlong marker, took a narrow lead at mid-stretch and dueled into the final sixteenth, fought gamely into
deep stretch and was bested by the determined winner in the final strides, while clear of the rest for second. TORPEDO AWAY tracked the solid early pace
from the second flight, was well placed into the turn and tracked two wide to the quarter marker, ran evenly while within aim approaching the furlong
grounds, needed more into the final sixteenth and was outkicked by the top pair, while just holding for show honors at the finish. REFI NOW settled off of the
quick early pace while not far back, was guided two wide into the turn and was unhurried to the quarter marker, improved position into the stretch, rallied in
the final sixteenth and just missed for third. J T'S WATCH chased the solid pace from the inside, gained ground into the turn and raced within aim at the
quarter marker, maintained an inside position into the stretch, was outkicked at mid-stretch and could not muster a final response. THE CALABRESE KID
broke slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, maintained a two wide path along the turn and improved position in the final furlong. MY DOMINATOR
tracked the solid early pace from the outside, raced close up to the leading pair heading into the turn and stalked four to five wide at the quarter marker,
came widest into the stretch and chased to the furlong marker, could not keep pace into the final sixteenth and weakened.

SUNRISE MISCHIEF hustled from the gate and briefly contested the early pace but proved unable to keep up, was kept in a drive and to the outside four to
five wide, kept to task and swung six wide into the stretch and ran on under constant handling to be along in time. FAR TO LONG was slow to get into stride
then rushed up to be just behind the dueling leaders going into the turn, was put into a stiff drive when they quickened away on the turn, kept to task and
soldiered on with good courage down the stretch to gain the second spot. REGAL REDWOOD was on the outside of the speed duel four deep, was
traveling well down the backstretch then moved up to challenge three wide for the lead at the quarter pole still in hand, responded when set down in the
stretch, battled with WHAT A RELIEF to mid-stretch, put that one away at the furlong pole but was out finished near the wire. DELIAN LEAGUE was last
away and outrun for the first quarter mile, angled over toward the rail to save ground through the turn, came into the stretch on the wrong lead and made a
nice late run despite lugging in all the way to the finish. PAKAS SECRET broke a beat slow but rushed up to join the early fray down the backstretch, raced
close up to the dueling leaders through the turn, backed off the pace some when there was nowhere to go, came into the stretch on the left lead and raced
greenly down the stretch but was making some gains in the late stages. BEAU BRUME outrun early, was pushed to keep up passing the half-mile marker,
saved ground through the turn, came under heavy pressure from the quarter pole and passed a few in the late stages. WHAT A RELIEF was three off the
rail as part of the early duel, came into the stretch battling with REGAL REDWOOD then tired from early efforts and was outfinished in the final furlong.
CONEJO MALO broke sharply and was inside of four horses competing for the early lead, backed out passing the seven-sixteenths pole, came under a ride
and struggled to keep pace down the stretch. HOT CAKE broke well, raced between horses in the early duel, got a head in front heading into the turn, gave
way before the stretch and was protected late.

Footnotes
LORD SHELDON was forwardly placed away from the start and stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, stalked the decent pace three wide
through the backstretch run and was well placed heading into the second turn, mounted a four wide bid into the stretch and loomed approaching the furlong
pole, determinedly battled into the final sixteenth, dueled with PASS THE BATON into deep stretch and won the nod on the wire to gamely prevail. PASS
THE BATON lunged at the start and was off a bit slowly, recovered and tracked the early pace three wide along the first turn, was well placed through the
backstretch run and went three wide into the far turn, swung five wide for the drive and was set down into upper stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong
marker and took a narrow advantage at mid-stretch, dug in while holding a narrow lead into the final sixteenth, dueled with LORD SHELDON into deep
stretch and was gamely bested at the finish for the win, while just holding for second at the finish. BID ON THE PRIZE was allowed to settle in the early
going, raced two wide into the backstretch run and was unhurried to the half-mile marker, was roused three wide heading to the quarter pole, swung six
wide for the drive and rallied at mid-stretch, closed fast while widest into the final sixteenth and just missed for the win and place, while getting up in time to
secure show honors. NO SECRET showed good speed leaving the start and assumed command of the early running, showed the way into the first turn and
set prompted fractions through the backstretch run, was pressed into the second turn and battled for the lead into upper stretch, lost the lead approaching
the furlong marker, continued to battle into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch. HYDRO FROST was forwardly placed leaving the start,
tracked the early pace two wide along the first turn, gained ground along the backstretch run and was well placed at the half-mile pole, maintained a two
wide path into the far turn then became blocked at the quarter pole, dove to the inside into upper stretch and gained ground at the furlong marker, battled for
the lead into the final sixteenth and was outkicked in deep stretch. GRACEFUL MISCHIEF was bumped by an inner rival at the start and was away a bit
slowly, was unhurried into the first turn and maintained a two wide path into the backstretch run, made a steady gain while two wide into the far turn,
continued that bid into the stretch, could not sustain his bid into the final sixteenth and finished evenly. ACCLIDER was prominent leaving the start, stalked
the pace into the first turn and prompted the decent pace through the backstretch run, pressed NO SECRET into the second turn, lost position approaching
the furlong pole and faded in the final stages. BIG SPIN was allowed to settle away from the start, saved ground into the first turn and was unhurried through
the backstretch run, lost contact with the others heading to the quarter marker and did not factor in the stretch drive.
