BELLAMYSAWESOMEDAY went to the front, drove clear, led throughout and won under steady urging. RUSTY'S SUNRISE pressed the pace, had an
outside trip, made a late bid, finished willingly and got up for second. SHE BADGER pressed the early pace, forwardly placed throughout, raced outside
around the final turn and lacked a late kick. C C LLAM raced within contention, put forth an even effort and couldn't gain on the leaders. COSTA LADY
lacked early speed, came around the second turn wide, showed late interest, but was no factor. ALESSANDE raced near the middle of the field, made a
mild bid and weakened. LIGHT FACE was an early factor, faded and proved no threat late. BACK STREET BABY broke out, raced evenly near the back
and showed little. COZY COURTNEY void of early speed and was outrun. SUGAR CANE GAL broke in, trailed the field and was never close.

and was outfinished for second. BE A BANDIT sprinted to the front, drove clear and faded. BITSY C C LIL GIRL raced within striking distance, saved ground
around the second turn and finished evenly. KELLYS THE BOSS lacked early speed, moved up, but was no factor. SEE SASSY RUN raced within striking

raced outside around the final turn, made a wide gain, finished willingly and was outfinished for second. LITTLE WARRIOR raced near the back in the
beginning, moved up on the rail after turning for home, angled out around DIAL UNCLE JOEY down the lane and went to the wire evenly. COCAL lacked
early speed, made a mild bid, but was no factor. CARLOS'S MAMA void of early speed and passed tired ones. DIAL UNCLE JOEY dueled on the front end,
took the advantage down the backside and faded around the final turn. INFINITESIMAL raced in the middle of the field and faded. NATIVE STAR raced
