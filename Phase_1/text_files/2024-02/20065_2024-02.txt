Footnotes
OUR KEEPSAKE behind the first flight into and through the turn in the two path and between horses, split foes nearing the furlong marker, took command,
larger lead late, dug in the final strides to hold the runner up at bay. KEY TO SUCCESS lacked early foot, came five wide when beginning to advance into
the stretch, challenged outside the winner in the waning strides, turned back to be outfinished at the wire. CHANISA behind the pace along the inside
backstretch, steered out to be three wide for the drive, finished willingly to be clear of the others and to be closing the gap on the top two late. THE GIRL IN
RED in the second flight outside, three wide and between horses into the stretch, went evenly to the wire in lacking a late kick. PIONEER PARADE in tight
at the start, recovered to press early outside, dueled through the turn off the inside, vied into the lane, weakened the final furlong. D'ORO STREET away in
good order, dueled up front along the inside for a half then began to give way. HOUSE OF MAGIC in the second flight inside, continued behind traffic late in
the turn, moved out a bit for room into the stretch, came up empty. CROWN THIRTY last away, trailed in the three path throughout.

SUMMER OF MISCHIEF forwardly placed from the start off the inside, cleared to the inside early in the turn, maintained daylight through the stretch under
steady handling. MAMBA OUT within striking distance while racing outside, chased the winner through the turn and into the stretch in the two path, proved
no match in the run to the wire, clearly second best. RISKY SPIRIT broke back, raced in the two path through the turn, rallied for the show, no threat to the
top pair. BYZANTINE void of speed outside, angled four wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. ALWAYS SMILING within
striking distanced inside early, moved out to be three wide by midway on the turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing respond. SAMMIES
SAMURAI pressed the issue early inside, had little left for the stretch run. TIZ SWEET CANDY forward early inside, shuffled back along the rail before a
quarter, moved out, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing response. CUPID'S MUSIC off a step slow, remained back while racing along the inside.
COROMANDEL broke back, lacked speed, failed to muster a rally. PAT'S GAL settled in mid pack off rail, three wide turn, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
MIRI A COINCIDENCE pressed the issue early in the two path, advanced to duel through much of the turn, shook clear in upper stretch, steadily drew out
the final furlong while being kept to task. SPEITFUL SAM behind the pace early inside, in some traffic early in the turn, two path into the stretch, chased the
winner to the wire, no match for that one, held sway for the place. ROMAN GIANT off a step slow, lacked speed off the inside, raced three wide through the
turn, rallied to be in time for the show. COMMUNICATION MEMO in mid pack early outside, four wide through the turn, reached second flight in upper
stretch then flattened out late to lose the show. MISTER SHARPIE broke alertly, set the early pace inside up the backstretch, dueled through the turn while
continuing along the rail, faltered in the drive. FORSAKEN in the second flight while outside, three wide through the turn, had little for the stretch run.
INVARIABLY went one paced throughout while racing three wide. EASY BIG BOY fell back to trail after the start, four wide through the bend, remained
back. REUP back off the pace, dropped inside turn, began to fade and was finished before a half. TWISTED DIXIE failed to menace while racing off the
inside.

Footnotes
GOOD HEART with the pace from the start, narrowly showed the way through the turn along the inside, drew out steadily through the lane while being kept
to pressure. SLAM DUNK SERMON in mid pack early off the inside, rallied and proved determined for the place, no threat winner. UNDER THE GUN
behind the pace along the inside, continued to save ground into the stretch, late bid for the runner up position while still on the rail, missed. BLACK STORM
off a bit slow, raced well back early,improved into the stretch off the inside, not enough late for the seconds spot while widest of the second group at the
wire. POPULIST prompted the early pace outside, remained forward while three wide through the bend, weakened through the stretch. VIOLENT GIGI
settled in mid pack just off the inside, failed to muster a rally when called on for the drive. DOUBLE TUFF in the second flight early, moved a bit closer while
four wide into the stretch, weakened in the drive. COST BASIS with the lead pack for a half while between horses, faltered in the drive. PRESS SNOOZE
fell back to trail after the start, was never a factor. WELLMAN was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
ADIVA never far back after an alert break, second flight turn, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, dueled to the finish outside the runner
up, proved best in a determined effort. JUBILANT JOANIE broke with the winner, prompted the issue up the backstretch outside, advanced, took over turn,
two path into the lane, dueled to the wire inside the winner, outkicked late. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD in the second flight off the inside, came three wide for
the drive, could do little with the top two late, edged clear for the show. CHIP SHORTAGE narrowly showed the way from between horses late backstretch,
vied through the turn inside, weakened in the drive. KITIARA in mid pack while racing off the inside, three wide into the turn, traffic soon after, two path late
in the bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick. COURAGEOUS CAPPEN turned in an even effort while four wide through the turn.
BETTY JO made little impact while racing in the two path. MY CAJUN LADY lacked speed off the inside, four to five wide out of the turn, lacked a closing
kick. CHARLOTTES WAY was never a threat. WILDWOOD ENOUGH flashed brief early speed along the inside and stopped. MISSY PIGGY broke back,
trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
PHANTOM RIDE allowed the pace to go early while out in the strip, advanced into contention three to four wide second turn, took over into the stretch, clear
late, enough left to hold the runner up safe late. TRIGGER HAPPY back off the early speed, closer three wide late in the final turn, waited behind traffic into
the stretch, moved out for room once straightened for home, finished well to be closing the gap on the winner late. LONG CROW broke back, void of speed
while saving ground, worked way four wide by late in the final turn, rallied to be in time for the show. GUIDED ARROW took over after the start, set the pace
along the inside, came out a bit while seeing that lead diminish into the stretch, began to weaken when headed in upper stretch. SUPER CONSTITUTION
forwardly placed while off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a response when asked. CITY OF CLOUDS in the second flight early outside, crept
closer to challenge between rivals turning for home, failed to sustain that advance in the run to the wire. EL FRANCO off a step slow, trailed early off the
inside, improved slightly while never posing a serious threat. DEEP STATE finished early, was never involved. ARMAGNAC chased the leader for a half off
the inside, stopped far turn.

Footnotes
HENRO behind the first flight off the inside, moved closer three to four wide late in the turn, bid nearing the furlong marker, late duel, proved best in game
fashion. MAJOR MACK broke alertly from the outside, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch, continued to set the pace through the turn while in the
two path, hooked up with the winner with just over a furlong to run, dueled to the wire inside that one, outkicked late. RONALDINHO with the pace up the
backstretch closest to the inside, fell back some through the turn while continuing inside, went evenly through the stretch to finish up best of the rest. RIDE
FOR SUL came out after the start to bother an outer rival, lacked speed, steered out three wide turning for home, improved position with some late interest.
WORLD FAIR prompted the issue early off the inside, dueled through the turn outside the runner up, weakened through the stretchg. ORANGE DIABLO in
the main group outside, four wide through the turn, lacked a rally. TOP GUN ROCKET in mid pack and off the inside, continued in the two path through the
turn, also was found lacking in the drive. BRAVEN in traffic backstretch, moved off the inside, four wide into the lane, remained back. STRASSE bothered at
the start, in mid pack early, stopped after a half, far back, jogged in. GONNA BE ALL RIGHT in tight up the backstretch, lost action with just over a half mile
to run, unseated rider and fell soon after.

Footnotes
SHACKLEFORD STRONG forwardly placed early on the outside, tracked the leader three wide through the turn, challenged on the outside upper stretch,
drifted in slightly, clear by the furlong marker, enough left to last. ETERNALLY GRATEFUL back off the pace well out in the strip, four to five wide through
the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to be getting to the winner late. JUNIOR BUG back off the pace and the inside after being last away, two path
and in some traffic through the turn, also was going well late to be closing the gap on the winner. SHACKS WAY in tight at the break, void of early foot,
came five wide into the lane, improved position with some mild late interest. I'M WIDE AWAKE broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, faltered in the
drive. BORN FLAWLESS chased the leader for a half from the outside, had little left for the drive. BLOW TORCH well back off the pace, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. CHAPEL BARN tired while saving ground. BURNINHUNKOFLOVE in the main group early outside, fanned
six wide into the stretch, tired in the run to the wire. BIG SWEDE in some traffic backstretch, raced in the second flight into the turn, backed up down the
lane.

Footnotes
HARLOCAP stalked the pace off the inside, remained three wide up the backstretch when stalking the leader, crept closer while still in the three path and
under patient handling in the second turn, drove steadily clear down the stretch. KING RUSSELL void of early foot off the inside, advanced into contention
three to four wide second bend, proved no match for the winner through the strtch, edged clear for the second spot. B MINOR broke alertly, clear into the
first turn while getting to the inside, set a pressured pace, briefly responded when confronted by the winner turning into the stretch then proved no match,
failed to match strides with the runner up inside that inside the furlong grounds, comfortably saved the show. GAME KEEPER went one paced throughout
while saving all the ground. LORD VICENTE (ARG) back off the pace and the inside, came four wide for the drive, lacked a closing kick. FLYING HOUDINI
chased the leader from off the inside in the two path for six furlongs, had little left for the drive. SOUTHERN SUNSET broke outward and lastly, void of
speed, closer up the inside when rank backstretch, also had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
ALL THINGS GO moved up to within striking position into the turn, continued to advance three wide in the bend, took over turning for home, shook clear and
maintained daylight under firm handling. LEAD WITH SPEED broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn, offered brief resistance to
the winner late in the bend, proved no match in the drive, clearly second best. JUST AN OPINION forwardly placed early inside, moved out to be three wide
out of the turn, could do little with the top pair through the lane, finished best of the rest. WHAT'S HER NUMBER off slow then hopped to spot the field a
couple of lengths, trailed early, four wide into the turn, angled in a bit then steered out to be widest for the drive, rallied down the middle of the strip to
improve position. PAM PAM off the pace and the inside, five wide into the stretch, finished up evenly. LITE IT UP LOUIE went one paced while racing off the
inside. WISE MISS moved inside, saved ground through the turn to no avail, also lacking a rally,. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU remained back in failing to
menace. ST. OLAF ROSE pressed the pace from the two path for a half and gave way. ALAMO lacked speed, remained back to be always outrun.
