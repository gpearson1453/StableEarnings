Footnotes
FAST STUDY never far back, closed willingly four then three wide to make the lead in upper stretch and proved best under mild right handed urging. STEP
AHEAD vied for the lead along the inside through the far turn, loomed boldly two wide at the top of the stretch then couldn't handle the winner while well
clear for second. WILEY T surged four wide to make the lead after a quarter, dropped inside, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened.
ELEGGUA set the pace two wide around the clubhouse turn, kept pressure three wide into the far turn then weakened readily. DANGEROUS MIND was
outrun. ELEVATED CAUSEWAY was through after a half.

POWERFUL MOON away alertly, set a pressured pace in the three path down the backstretch, shook clear entering the turn then widened the balance of
the trip to win as much the best while taken in hand late. RIKIO trailed early, rallied three wide through the turn and into the stretch to finish well clear for
second. ESTILO FAVORITO bobbled at the start, rushed to contention two wide nearing the half mile marker, was in tight at the seven sixteenths pole
causing his rider to steady a bit, chased the winner into the stretch then weakened. MARLEY LUCK rushed to contention along the rail before a quarter,
checked entering the turn and lost momentum. FRANK N DUCKY had brief speed, stopped abruptly on the turn, was eased to the wire, fell past the finish
line and was vanned off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND THE RIDER OF ESTILO FAVORITO LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL
AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH, AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS UPHELD THE
ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.
