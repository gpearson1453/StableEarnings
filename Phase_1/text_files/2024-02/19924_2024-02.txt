Footnotes
IN JUST MY HEELS close up from the start, took over in the three path far turn, clear into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling.
AVA'S LOOK settled off the pace while saving some ground, continued inside into the second turn, angled out and began to rally three wide late in that
bend, could do little with the winner through the lane, determined for the place. MY FAVORITE GIRL broke out to bother and forced out to outer rivals, was
straightened, lacked speed, came four wide out of the final turn, bid for the place, outkicked for that position. CATALYST within striking distance along the
inside, continued to save ground second turn, came up empty for the drive. LITTLE JAMIE bumped, forced out break, moved up to prompt the issue four
wide through the first turn, continued four wide into the far turn, weakened. MIDSUMMER MARCH lacked speed along the inside, saved ground to no avail
in lacking a closing response. HAPPY TALK in the second flight along the inside, three wide into the far turn, lacked rally. OFF THE LAM bumped, pushed
out start, lacked speed three wide, remaineds back. AMY Z broke on top, set the pace inside, gave way far turn, continued to back up through the stretch.

Footnotes
BLAME J D with the pace while between rivals for a half, disposed of the other speed to be clear into the stretch, steadily increased advantage while kept to
pressure. HOLDING PATTERN bumped slightly in some traffic just after the start, lacked speed, angled out, widest for the drive, rallied down the middle of
the strip to be in time for the place. TRAFFIC CONTROL in the second flight outside, four wide into the stretch, displayed some mild interest to be along for
the show. STOMPING HOTROD in mid pack while racing inside, angled two path into lane, improved a bit, flattened out in the late going to lose the show.
HERITAGE PARK broke sharper, with the pace along the inside, gradually weakened while continuing inside. REEF'S DESTINY lacked speed along the
inside, continued to save ground turn, improved position through the stretch slightly while not not a serious threat. HIGHTAIL COWBOY in the second group
early off the inside, fell back in some traffic late in the turn, lacked a response in the drive. CITRUS BAY away in good order, contested the issue up front in
the three path and widest, first to blink midway on the turn, continued to weaken. JACKS SPRING BREAK broke back, was not a threat while in the two
path. CAMPISI in mid pack while outside, four to five wide turn, failed to muster a rally when called on. PROMISING SHOES last away, trailed inside and
was never a factor. ROSIE'S BOY was never involved while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SHOW ME THE CANDY never far back, dropped inside turn, rail bid into the stretch, gained the advantage while just off the rail past the furlong marker,
drifted in with a sixteenth remaining when clear, held the runner up safe late. GOGO BOBBYJO back off the pace, began to advance along the inside
midway on the turn, reached a position along the rail closest to the winner a furlong out, altered course to the outside as that rival was drifting in soon after,
finished willingly to be slowly closing the gap on the winner late. ART QUEEN settled in mid pack off the inside, three wide through the turn, steered out in
some traffic inside the furlong grounds, along for the show late, not a threat to the top two. MIESHA broke back, lacked speed toward the inside, rallied four
wide exiting the turn, improved position with some belated interest. CATTY CRUISE in mid pack while just off the inside, continued in the two path turn,
lacked a serious closing response. OCEAN BIRD vied up front off the inside, faltered after a half. CHOCTAW GRACE stalked the pace off the rail, four wide
into the stretch, angled four wide into the stretch, weakened. PLEASINGLY away well inside, dueled along the rail early, two path into the lane allowing the
winner the inside, gave soon after when headed by that one. BIG BOLT within striking distance while three wide for a half, backed up through the stretch.
BOOGIE ON broke back, four wide through the turn, failed to muster a rally. FIRST DIAMOND restless in the gate, raced back along the along the inside,
steadied along the rail into the turn, remained back. ANGELIC VISION dwelt at the start, throughout while racing off the inside. FOLLOWING A CLAM OF
FOUL BY THE RIDER OF GOGO BOBBYJO AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, THE RESULT WAS
ALLOWED TO STAND.

MIRACLE SHOES with the pace while racing outside, came four wide into the lane, clear inside the furlong marker, held the runner up in the final strides.
TEXAS SEQUOIA lacked speed well out in the strip, came four to five wide out of the turn, closed with good energy down the middle of the strip to be
getting to the winner late. REAUX BINA in the main group while racing outside, three wide through the turn, rallied for the show, not a serious threat for the
show. DR. WOODS MIRACLE off a step slow, raced back and inside, came in the two path for the drive, staged a mild rally to improve position. KANTIRUN
pressed the pace while between horses for a half, began to weaken turning for home. TIZ A STRATEGY void of speed, three to four wide turning into the
stretch, lacked a closing kick. FIRST CLASS GIRL off a step slow, moved up to race in mid pack before a quarter, had little for the drive. LATIFAH broke on
top, narrowly showed the way up the backstretch and into the turn in the two path, continued to duel upper stretch, faltered the final furlong. HONEY PAT in
the second flight while racing toward the inside, backed up through the stretch. FABULOUS TALE fell back, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
WINGS FROM ABOVE broke alertly, set the pace in hand, clear into the stretch, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling.
THERESASILVERLININ behind the pace toward the inside, rallied up the rail to gain the place. CARICIA behind the leader toward the rail, traffic late in the
turn, angled out a bit to be in the two path for the drive, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could do little with that one to the wire nor contain the
runner up, all out to save the show. TYRONA in the second flight while between horses, went evenly in the drive in lacking a closing response. LADY
COMMANDER off a step slow, lacked speed out in the strip, five path through the turn, improved a bit in the drive without posing a serious threat. VOW
settled in mid pack early,three wide into the stretch, lacked a rally to also finish up one paced. OUR BET fell back to trail for a half, picked off some tiring
rivals after the issue had been decided. SINGING EMMA chased the winner early out in the strip, four wide turning for home, gave way. SHELL SHOCK
remained always back in lacking a rally. LANTERN'S CANDY was never a factor while racing four wide. THE PRINCESS SAYS steadily faded while racing
outside.

Footnotes
HUGE BIGLY broke in good order, stalked the pace in the three path, called on for some run turning for home, challenged outside the leader inside the
furlong marker, closed with good energy to win going away. HOME RUN TRICK broke on top, alternated up front closest to the inside while rating early,
disposed of the other speed once straightened for home, proved no match for the winner late, held the place. BEER CHASER four wide when forwardly
placed into the first turn, dueled onto the backstretch off the inside, continued to alternate up front into the stretch, also proved no match for the winner late,
outkicked for the second spot. MYSTERY MO dropped inside first turn, went one paced, two path through the second bend, went evenly through the stretch.
ICARUS lacked early foot, angled out to be three wide into the stretch, improved position without posing a serious threat. NAUTILUS (BRZ) settled off the
pace and the inside, three wide second turn, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. WINDCRACKER in the second flight while racing
just off the inside, had little left for the rail. DEVIL VISION broke back, lacked speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while not a factor. CANADIAN
PHAROAH in the main body early, began a steady retreat before a half. THAT'S SOMETHING fractious in the gate, off a step slow, remained always back.
COMPLY stumbled badly at the break, also was never a factor. GREATHEART steadily faded in the three path.

Footnotes
XTREME DIVA within striking distance out in the strip, three wide through the turn while maintaining forward position, engaged the leader from the outside
past the furlong marker, wore that one down under firm handling. ASTERNIA away well from the outside, clear before a quarter, set the pace, gave ground
grudgingly to the winner late. LEGADEMA broke in good order, fell back, asked along three wide into the lane, finished up willingly to annex the show.
READY FOR TROUBLE last away, moved inside, angled four wide turning for home, showed some belated interest to improve position. DEBOISBLANC
pressed the runner up along the inside, faltered in the drive. OUR KEEPSAKE settled behind the pace in the two path, had nothing for the drive. HITTIN MY
STRIDE lacked speed, in some traffic early in the turn, remained back in failing to menace. COPPER EM in the main group outside, four wide through the
turn, tired in the drive. CURLIN'S MAGIC remained back to be always outrun. CHEEKY GAL in the second flight early, stopped, fell far back and jogged in.

Footnotes
COMPARATIVE broke on top despite a slight bobble, showed the way into and through the first turn inside, dueled, headed far turn, regained the advantage
turning for home, while closest to the inside, turned back a pair of bids soon after and dug in late to prevail in game fashion. ICE ORCHID tracked the
leaders from along the inside for six furlongs switched out when straightened for home, lodged a late bid on the outside inside the furlong grounds, hung late
to be outfinished. MISTY VEIL moved up steadily soon after the start to secure a forward position, stalked in hand, moved out, challenged three wide turning
for home, raced on equal terms with the winner past the furlong marker as the runner up was mounting a bid, weakened late between those two to finish
best of the rest. BUTTERBEAN lacked early foot just off the inside, moved a bit closer toward the rail late in the final turn, flattened out in the drive. HOT
AND SULTRY stumbled at the start to trail early, continued back, two path into the lane, improved position with some mild late interest. SHOTGUN HOTTIE
moved up to press the winner early in the three path, dueled late backstretch, put a head in front into the far turn, weakened from between horses nearing
the furlong grounds. JUST KATHERINE steadied in some traffic past the wire the first time, moved out, four wide into the first turn, remained back in failing
to rally. THE ALYS LOOK broke back, moved up to race in mid pack before a quarter, was finished after a half. SKRATCH KAT in the second flight three
wide, middle move to briefly move into contention four wide far turn, stopped.

Footnotes
THERIDEOFALIFETIME broke alertly, angled in to set the pace in hand, clear into the lane, increased advantage under steady handling. BANDERA
AZTECA also away in good order, chased the winner from the outside, proved no match for that one in the drive, clearly second best. IAN GLASS one
paced behind the top two along the inside, finished up best of the rest. CATHEDRAL BEACH in mid pack while racing well out in the strip, four wide through
the turn, moved a bit closer into the lane then evened out the final furlong. DRIFTER broke back, moved out while lacking speed, improved a bit while five
wide through the bend, also finished up one paced late. MAN ON THE MOON failed to menace while racing just off the inside. RED N WILD saved ground
to no avail. RISK PROFILE off a step slow, trailed inside, picked off a couple of tiring rivals. SEE SPOT RUN remained back while racing off the inside.
VIOLENT GIGI moved out in the second flight, raced three wide through the turn, backed up down the lane.
