Footnotes
FIRSTTIMEINFOREVER chased outside a rival off the pace, gained some ground in the middle stages, drew closer around the far turn still two wide, tipped
out in upper stretch and proved best in the final furlong. SPRING MAGIC sped clear early and steered to the inside, controlled the pace to the far turn,
pressured by KATERINI with a quarter mile left to run, held a short lead over outer rivals with a furlong remaining, yielded to the winner midstretch and
stayed on for a clear second. KATERINI closest in pursuit to the far turn, challenged from outside at the quarter pole, fought between rivals entering the final
furlong, weakened in the late stages but managed to save the third. CONTROL FUNCTION broke a step slow, tracked along the rail to the far turn, moved
to the two path around that bend, put in a mild late bid and missed the show three deep at the wire. VINCERO GRANDE also broke a step slow, tracked
from the rail position through both turns, moved out in the lane, offered a mild response when called upon and missed third in a blanket finish. IN YOUR
FACE settled off the pace in the two path then along the rail, stayed along the fence into the far turn, eased out and came three wide into the drive and
lacked further response. SHE'S A JOKER sat off the pace next to the fence, inched closer in the middle stages, chased within range while cutting the corner

UNKEPT SECRET stalked inside, coaxed along leaving the backstretch, slipped through the inside to challenge for command entering the lane, inched
ahead in upper stretch, dueled with WARREN'S SHOWGIRL in the final furlong and gamely prevailed. WARREN'S SHOWGIRL broke a step slow, chased
off the rail then three deep between rivals into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, bid three deep into the stretch, dueled outside UNKEPT
SECRET through the lane and just missed. STORMING GRAY broke cleanly then dropped back while drifting out, trailed five wide into the turn, angled
down to the inside around the bend, steered back out in the lane and was along for the show. CLASSY showed early speed from outside then chased the
lone leader up the backstretch, went four deep into the turn, raced three deep at the quarter pole, spun four wide into the drive, could not rally in the drive
and lost the show. LOVE MY CANDY went up to duel for the lead from outside then cleared approaching the half-mile pole, led along the rail then came off
the rail to the two path late on the bend, challenged from both sides entering the stretch, lost command in upper stretch and weakened. PLUM CREEK
showed early speed and fought LOVE MY CANDY briefly for the lead then chased past the half-mile pole, lost positions two wide on the turn and weakened
down the lane. LUCKY VEGAS got crowded along the inside early, angled out past the five-eighths pole, ridden along three to four wide on the turn and
tired in the stretch run.

Footnotes
NAUVOO sprinted clear and crossed over into the turn, controlled the pace to the far turn, spurted away at the five-sixteenths pole, put to left handed urging
in upper stretch, widened under strong handling to the sixteenth to pole and was flagged with the whip late. SOL DEL SUR brushed with outer rival in the
beginning, stalked on the inside into the clubhouse turn then shifted to the two path around the bend, closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased two into
the far turn, roused three wide at the five-sixteenths pole, angled in late on the bend, could not make any headway on the winner but churned on to secure
second. BRAZENLY stalked two then three wide early, rounded the far turn three to four wide and lacked a rally. ZIMBA WARRIOR sat off the pace outside
a rival, stayed two wide through the far turn and failed to menace. GRANADA FLAVOR brushed with inner rival at the start, trailed on the inside, three to
four wide on the far turn and was never a factor. GOOD JUJU settled inside, hugged the rail through the far turn inside a rival and never threatened.

Footnotes
JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT reserved in the early going racing outside rivals, rounded the bend two wide, rallied and drew alongside the leader past the eighth
pole, put a head in front at the sixteenth pole and edged away. STRIKINGLY hit the gate to break a bit slow, settled off the pace on the inside then gained
ground past the half-mile pole, needed an opening chasing behind the leader around the turn, gained a clear path leaving the bend, quickly cleared in upper
stretch but got outkicked by the winner in the final sixteenth. PRINCESS MIDNIGHT turned her head and stumbled at the start, trailed on the rail into the
turn, angled out midway around the bend, spun three wide into the stretch, drifted to the inside then back out in deep stretch and gained the show.
COLLECTIVELY sprinted well clear early then held a diminished lead into the turn, showed the way on the inside then in the two path around the bend,
lugged out into the lane, lost the lead in the process and weakened in the furlong grounds. APPLE FEST stalked out of range then closed in up the
backstretch, took the turn two then three wide, got floated out by the leader entering the lane and weakened in the drive. ORDERLY TRANSITION (GB) hit
the gate and came away slow, traveled near the back in the early going, saved ground to the stretch and faded. HOT LAVA CAKE tracked three wide into
the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, got carried six wide approaching the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
BIG POND hustled to a forward position the pressed from outside, fought outside DADDYSRUBY two then three wide around the bend, took over nearing
the eighth pole, put away inner rival midstretch and was kept busy to the wire. SCARY FAST RIDE stalked the top pair from inside into the turn, angled out
past the five-sixteenths pole, chased four wide turning for home, finished determinedly through the stretch but had to settle for second best. DADDYSRUBY
cleared quickly then set the pace inside BIG POND up the backstretch, maintained a short lead on the inside then two wide leaving the bend, relinquished
the lead outside the eighth pole and flattened to third. ROSE MADDOX brushed with inner rival at the start to lose a step, trailed in the early going,
advanced along the inside through the turn, moved out in upper stretch and flattened in the late stages. ALL DIALED IN gave chase outside rivals into the
turn, took the turn four wide and lacked a response in the lane. ROSE DAWSON brushed with ROSE MADDOX in the beginning, stalked three wide into the
turn, dropped back around the bend, entered the lane two wide and weakened.

Footnotes
EL REY REY traveled in mid-pack along the inside in the early going, inched closer around the far turn, came off the rail while gaining into the final furlong,
drew alongside the runner-up with a sixteenth left to run and drove clear. LET SEAMUS GO showed the way inside rivals early then cleared around the
clubhouse turn, controlled the pace up the backstretch, cornered nicely while ridden along into the stretch, remained clear into the final furlong, challenged
by EL REY REY in deep stretch and could not fend off the winner. AMERICAN GLORY (GB) reserved in the opening stages and steered to the two path,
saved ground through the far turn, came off the rail int he lane and showed late run to earn the show honors. MESSAGE OF HOPE (IRE) rated on the
inside, drew closer on the far turn, tipped two wide into the lane but flattened in the late stages. SKETCHY tracked two wide, pulled between rivals early on
the backstretch, continued in the two path on the far turn, steered out into the lane and failed to threaten. CHASING RAIN traveled near the back early on,
went two wide into the far turn, moved to the rail around the bend, kept trying through the lane but needed to find more. UNCHARTED showed early speed
between rivals then took a stalking position in the two path around the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, chased two wide then three
wide into the stretch and weakened. BRITISH ISLES was a bit rank early on then settled inside, became rank again early on the backstretch then settled
back down, coaxed along approaching the far turn, trailed with a quarter mile remaining and passed tired rivals down the lane. NITTI (IRE) tossed her head
and spotted the field a few lengths to begin, trailed on the inside then went outside a rival on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and was not a
factor. FAST CHAZ had early speed three deep then chased four wide into the first turn, moved over to the three path around the bend, chased three deep
then outside a rival in the middle stages, inched closer three deep on the far turn, drifted into the lane and weakened. BOUND TO SUCCEED tracked three
wide off the pace or outside a rival, remained three wide into the lane and failed to menace.
