Footnotes
JACK SLYE was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, was well handled on the front end, confronted off the turn but dug in gamely in the stretch to hold
on under a drive. TWIXTER stalked the pace three wide and made a bid off the turn to get close to even terms for command nearing the furlong marker, but
was out-kicked by the winner. DON'T QUESTION ME chased the pace on the inside and came two wide off the turn but had no kick while staying on for the
show award. LONG TOM was four wide into the first turn, then settled towards the inside, two wide on the far turn, then was on the inside off the turn but
had no kick while needing more. SWEEPIN HARD was rated early three wide and in between rivals but had no rally. SOUL STORY was allowed to settle
early towards the inside and lacked a solid rally. MUSKOKA GIANT was five wide into the first turn, then rated on the outside and came five wide off the turn
and faded.

Footnotes
WILD VINE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then widened the margin nearing the quarter pole and came two wide off the turn and drew
out to prove best while being kept to left handed crop urging. TIMELY PROSPECT prompted the winner three wide and chased on the wire but proved to be
no match for that rival while clearly second best. BROTHER BRAD tracked the early pace two wide, then was between rivals by the half mile marker, three
wide by the quarter pole and came four wide off the turn and faded, bested rest. KEEN LOOKIN stumbled at the start and was off slowly, then made a inside
middle move nearing the half mild marker, but weakened. SKIMBLE SHANKS was settled early between rivals and then passed the tiring rivals. CHAIN
REACTION stalked the pace four wide and came six wide off the turn and tired in the drive. ORASHI was off slowly, reserved early, five wide off the turn
and was never a threat. CAJUN OCCASION was four wide into the first turn, settled on the outside and then tired on the far turn.

Footnotes
MY DEVILS CHILD was off a step slow, reserved early three wide on the turn, came five wide off the turn and making a bid kicked clear leaving the furlong
marker to prove best under mild urging. HASHTAG WINNING was taken back early and to the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn, made a bid and
then angled out leaving the furlon g marker and finished willingly to be clearly second best. DESANTIS dueled for the lead two wide, then fell off the pace on
the turn and was three wide by the quarter pole, then came again to get the show award. BEE BY THE SEA pressed the early pace from the outside, made
a four wide bid nearing the quarter pole, then was carried out eight or nine wide leaving the turn by MARTINKELLY leaving the turn and flattened out.
MARTINKELLY dueled for the early lead on the inside, made a bid on the turn to shake clear, then began to lug out badly nearing the quarter pole, came
seven wide into the lane and weakened. CARGO SHIP chased the early pace three wide, then was two wide on the turn and weakened in the drive.
SPOOKY ONE stumbled at the start, then chased the pace on the inside and was empty in the drive.

BRIEF was well rated three wide, made a four wide bid by the quarter pole and came five wide off the turn, then hit the front nearing the furlong marker and
then slowly edged clear to prove best under a drive. KENTUCKY REIGN set a fast pace early while clear and in the two path, then was headed by the three
sixteenths and shifted out and fought on to the wire but was outfinished by the winner while being second best. NANASQUAN was reserved early on the
inside, advanced on the far turn and eased out nearing the quarter pole, came three wide into the lane and then angled out to the outside and made a bid by
the furlong marker but hung late, bested rest. WAHINE MEANIE was four wide into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide, then fell back by the five
sixteenths and dropped to the inside by the quarter pole and tired. INCONTROVERTIBLE chased the pace on the outside and was five wide on the far turn
and came six wide into the lane and tired. MAKE A SPLASH was settled early on the inside and tired. ALICE KRAMDEN was bumped at the start, reserved

DUST DEVIL was well rated on the inside, advanced on the inside on the far turn, tipped out three wide leaving the turn for aim, made a bid and edged clear
late to prove best under a drive. RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY set a pressured pace on the inside and then dug in gamely in the drive but was out-kicked by the
winner while staying on for the place award gamely. MIDNIGHT ACT pressed the pace in between rivals, made a two wide bid by the quarter pole, went on
even terms for command off the turn but was outfinished in the final furlong, hung. STRAWBERRY TREAT was allowed to settle early, came five wide into
the lane and improved position late. GIROLAMO'S ATTACK pressed the pace from the outside, three wide on the far turn and came four wide off the turn
and was empty. COPPERHEAD CREEK was settled on the inside and lacked a rally. UNCLE YUDI was reluctant to load, then was off slowly and then
trailed throughout in a dull effort.

Footnotes
BEJUCO was reserved early towards the inside, advanced on the turn, then came two wide off the turn, angled out and then went back in nearing the
furlong marker and then closed up the inside to get up in time under a drive. SPORTING THE GOLD was well rated early on the inside, then made a three
wide bid on the turn and took over off the turn and was clear by the furlong marker but was caught late to just miss. SYLVIA I AM was settled back early on
the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied well. SILK PRINCE broke outwardly at the start, then moved to the inside and made a inside
move on the turn but flattened out late. BULLET BREEZE was away alertly, then tracked the early speed three to four wide and weakened. SUPE tracked
the pace two to three wide and weakened. KNOWWHATIMEAN set the early pace while clear and gave way in the drive. SALVO TRIGGER chased the
pace three to four wide and tired.
