on the far turn and was kept sharp to late stretch before being taken in hand. LET'S EAT saved ground off the pace, picked up the chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail then flattened late while settling for second. SHARP STYLE raced well back about the three path, started bid
leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. RUN ROCKY RUN settled off the rail early on, gave chase
leaving the three eighths pole, raced in the five path on the far turn and weakened in the lane. WILLIAM'S CAUSE raced off the early pace about the three
path and showed little response through the backstretch. MEXICAN KRYPTONITE saved ground and was through early.

VICTORY ROYALE settled close off the rail, started a bid nearing the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep approaching the quarter, dueled clear
midway on the far turn and held on under steady stretch handling. IN TO THE NIGHT raced two deep on the first turn, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole
and came through the far turn near the rail, eased outward and made light contact with PUSH entering the stretch, dueled to clear second nearing
mid-stretch and was gaining on the winner. The latter saved ground, gave chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the three path on the far
turn, was bumped lightly leaving the turn, raced evenly through the stretch and just lasted for third. BEST VIRGINIA rounded the first turn in the three path,
eased out entering the backstretch and gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced five wide on the far turn and passed rivals in an even finish.
APPEALING ROAD was shuffled back shortly after the start and saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole,
rounded the far turn off the rail, angled out entering the stretch but showed little further. DIVA ROSE settled in the three path the first turn, gave chase
nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the four path on the far turn. KNOBIESMAGICSONDE was hustled to the lead while angling in and rated the
pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gave up the lead at the rail approaching the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn
and weakened.
