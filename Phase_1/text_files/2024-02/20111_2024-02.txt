Footnotes
GRAHMALAMADINGDONG saved ground throughout, bid on the turn and was up late following a long drive. LEX set the pace off inside, widened briefly on
the turn, drifted out in the stretch but held on gamely while outfinished. EDDIE W raced just off the leaders, swung very wide in the stretch with a mild rally.
KING MUFASA raced wide down the backstretch, two path turn then flattened out in stretch. BIAGIO crowded just after the start, trailed to the stretch and
was no factor. ZONA DE AMIGOS prompted the pace for half a mile and gave way. HEY WHAT'S UP dropped back after the break and was never a factor.
CRAIGH NA DUN raced along the rail and faded through the stretch. UNCLE ARLYS ran off in the post parade and was ordered a late scratch.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT CAT tracked close up on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied inside in the stretch run, took over passing the sixteenth marker and drew clear
under urging. TIEMPO PERFECTO set the pace racing a bit off the inside, moved away a bit midway on the turn, responded when roused, dug in gamely,
had the rider lose the crop at the furlong marker, then came up second best. ACHILLES HEEL raced off the pace inside, angled out at the eighth pole,
rallied mildly and got third. SAL N LOUIE chased two wide, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied mildly outside and was outkicked for
third. THTWASTHENTHISISNW stalked outside, chased on the turn and had no rally. IMAGINE THIS was outrun early, advanced inside on the turn and did
not factor. ALTA FOX stumbled badly at the start, raced off the pace, chased on the turn, came three wide into the lane and faded. LONG LEGGED BOY
raced off the pace, chased on the turn and gave way.

SPEIGHTSTER RED stalked the pacesetter, chased three wide on the far turn, rallied outside rivals turning for home, dug in gamely outside past the furlong
marker, then dueled with MEGA CHARLIE in deep stretch and narrowly prevailed at the wire. MEGA CHARLIE set the pace racing with a clear lead,
showed the way into the far turn, dueled between rivals past the quarter pole, dug in gamely between horses in midstretch, then hooked up with the winner,
dueled to the wire and just missed. JARLIAN raced two wide off the pace, chased inside on the far turn, made a rail bid and gained a short lead entering the
stretch, then dug in gamely on the rail, dueled and was outfinished. SAINT MARCO was outrun early on the inside, advanced inside on the far turn, waited
for room in upper stretch, angled in and rallied on the rail. SENIOR INVESTMENT was outrun early, raced three wide on the backside and far turn, then
lacked a stretch rally. SILVER EDGE raced four wide early, stalked three wide, chased on the far turn and tired. CORKMAN raced five wide early, settled off
the pace between rivals and faded. ALLEVARE raced off the pace inside and failed to respond when asked. JONNY QUIST raced six wide early, dropped
back on the backside and gave way. MONSTRODAMOUS stalked between rivals, chased and gave way.
