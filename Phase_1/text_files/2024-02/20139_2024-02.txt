Footnotes
SUBJECT TO CHANGE took an immediate lead and rated the pace, was urged leaving the half mile pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and held on with
steady stretch handling. PAYMENGOLD stalked off the rail, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path, raced
evenly to mid-stretch then flattened late. RAGTIME RICHES saved ground, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn then flattened
later yards. MARK DID IT settled off the pace about the three path, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path on the far
turn and showed little in the lane. GUN COLLECTOR saved ground, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and
showed little more. NEVER CHANGE raced in the six path the opening turn and showed little response leaving the second turn. STACKS OF SILVER was
not a factor. JUMPSTER came through the first turn about the five path, dropped well back and loped the course.

Footnotes
GEORGE took a quick lead while angling to the inside and rated the early pace, was pressured leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the turn
then kept alert in the stretch. RUNALDO gave early chase inside but was roughed from tight quarters at the rail approaching the quarter pole, checked
sharply behind a wall of horses and angled out leaving the eighth pole, dug in from that point and took second the final strides. TIME TO ROCK gave chase,
rounded the turn about the four path, dug in leaving the turn but flattened stride later yards. CUPID'S SONG exchanged contact with Jaxjaxxorjacks leaving
the gate then picked up the chase, raced in the three path on the turn and flattened stride late yards. KARMA BUS had his heels clipped by Born To Sin in
the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, gave chase from there, raced in the four path on the turn and showed little in the lane. REMYS GUNSMOKE
chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and weakened. TURTLE DOVE gave chase then weakened off the rail on the turn. JAXJAXXORJACKS
exchanged contact with Cupid's Song leaving the gate, was pulled up lame afterward and vanned off. BORN TO SIN clipped the heels of Karma Bus and
fell in the vicinity of the seven sixteenths pole, but got up and walked off post race. The Stewards reviewed the incident at the seven sixteenths pole and
another approaching the quarter pole before declaring this race official.

Footnotes
EVERYDAYISAGIFT moved to the inside and rated the early pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and
held on under steady encouragement. NOBLE OBSESSION gave chase, stayed in range in the three path on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. TAP THE
KEG gave chase, rounded the turn about the four path, drifted leaving the turn but finished evenly to take third the final yards. SONGTELLER gave chase,
rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. PRINCESS MIA ROSE bobbled after the break then settled inside, picked up the chase toward the
five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the turn and ran evenly in the lane. FLORINE gave chase, raced in the five path on the turn and passed rivals.
SK'S HEART gave chase, raced in the six path on the turn and left the turn wide. ZIDORMI gave chase, rounded the turn off the rail and showed little in the
lane. AZTECA GIRL became rank and started bucking on the chute and was eased shortly afterward and walked off post race.
