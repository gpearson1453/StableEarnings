Footnotes
KALINBA settled on the first turn into a tracking position, made a steady advance from three wide entering the final turn and cleared off in a drvie.
INSACIABLE PRINCE reserved off the pace down the backside, rallied four wide on the far turn to loom turning for home and kept on grinding through the
lane to be second best. WHEN IN ROME prompted the pace on the backstretch, took the lead on the final bend and weakened in upper stretch. PLAYING
BALL set a pressured pace to the three-eighths pole and faded. RAMBLIN CHROME was outrun.

JOKEMEISTER tracked the pace under restraint down the backside, rallied four wide entering the turn, took command nearing the quarter pole, quickly
cleared the field turning for home and pulled away down the lane. SCRATCHOFF dueled on the lead to the turn, responded to winner's challenge at the
quarter pole, was no match for that one and ran-on to hold the place. ONEMORANDTHECHECK stalked the pace to midway on the bend, lost position
nearing the quarter pole and showed late interest to be gain ground for the show. CHARGER failed to menace. TOYI pressed the pace to upper stretch and
weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
TRAGICALLY QUEWICK showed early speed to be on the lead, settled off the pace in hand on the turn, rallied turning for home, angled in and prevailed in
the drive. BIG FALCON ROCKET slow early to be at the rear of the pack, circled five wide at the head of the lane, closed well and was just out-finihsed late
in a good effort. UNCLE KEVIN tracked the leaders early, made a middle move to take the lead on the turn, opened a clear lead in upper stretch and
flattened out late in the lane while drifting out. STRIKE A BEAT was well placed stalking the pace and lacked a closing kick. WIZARD WILLIE pressed the
pace to the top of the lane and weakened through the stretch.

EXACTITUDE set a well rated, well measured pace on a comfortable lead, responded when called upon leaving the quarter pole and drew away without
being challenged. CROSSED UP stalked the pacesetter from the fence, tipped out while rallying turning for home, failed to gain on the leader and kept-on
through the lane for the place. TWERK unhurried in the early going to be at the back of the pack, circled five wide and showed good late interest with a
steady gain in the stretch. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT made a three wide rally on the bend and failed to sustain the bid. POWER BANKER well placed
chasing the pacesetter through the turn and lacked a response when called upon finishing evenly.

WATCHOUTFORWEAVER stalked the pace from between horses down the backside, taken in hand off pace, failed to quicken with the leaders at the
three-eights pole, angled out turn making a steady advance and wore the leader down inside the eighth pole. PROSECUTOR raced wide in the first turn,
moved up three wide to take the lead down the backside on a slow pace, battled through the turn with the pacesetter, shook that one off in upper stretch
and battled with the winner to late in the lane in a game effort. EAGLE NEST dueled on the lead from the inside to the top of the lane and weakened nearing
the eighth pole. PRESSLEY RIDGE slow early to trail and never posed a threat. I STRONG tracked the leaders down the backside, mounted a four wide
rally into the turn and flattened out.

MUTINY set the pace throughout, responded when called upon at the quarter pole, dug-in for the drive and prevailed determinedly. BISCUITS AND GRITS
prompted the pace from three wide the entire trip, rallied turning for home and failed to get passed in a good try. CRYPTO COPY tracked the leaders from
the inside saving ground on the turn, rallied up the fence in the stretch and could not close ground while finishing willingly. DOUGS MORNING PICK
reserved off the early pace, made a five wide rally on the turn and flattened out coming home. THAT'S THE WAY trailed most of the way as a non-threat.
GIFT OF OAK chased the leaders from three wide down the backside, mounted a bid between horses into the turn and faded comng home.

SHE'S CRAFTY slow early to trail for the first half mile, circled six wide on the turn making steady progress and closed well to be clear late. R THREE
ANGELS set the pace on a well rated, clear lead, responded when called upon at the head of the lane and could not hold offf the closer in deep stretch.
NEAR PERFECT stalked the leaders into the final turn, rallied to upper stretch to loom and kept grinding through the lane. HIGH FIRE rated in mid-pack
throughout and lacked a closing kick in the lane. IN TROUBLED WATERS was never a threat. SHAKA'S LYRIC prompted the pace for a half and came up
empty when called upon into the turn.

RUN RED RUN raced mid-pack to the turn, circled five wide with a bold move on the turn to quickly take command and held the closer safe at the wire. C V
DYNAMIC stalked the leaders through the turn, continued to close ground steadily through the stretch and was slowly getting to the winner. CINSAULT
unhurried for the first half mile and found best stride in the lane showing good late interest. SWAYBACK MOBIL reserved off the pace and made a mild
belated bid in the stretch. WEEKEND RETREAT raced five wide chasing the leaders and lacked a closing response. DRILIN' FOR GEMS bumped at the
start, rushed up the fence to take the lead, kept on to the quarter pole and tired. GHOST OF LONDYN was well placed in striking distance and finished
evenly lacking a closing kick. GO TOTHE PRINCIPAL was not a threat. CATCHING MY WIND flashed brief speed and was through early.
