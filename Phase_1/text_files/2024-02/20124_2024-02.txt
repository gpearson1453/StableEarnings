Footnotes
FLASH N CLASS broke sharp and showed the way along the inside, inched clear of an outer presser leaving the quarter pole and held sway. WHITE ICE
laid off of the pace three to four wide, rallied to gain place at the sixteenth pole but needed more to reel in the leader. GUMBALL pressed three to two wide
into the turn, but failed to sustain pressure passing the quarter pole, chased thereafter but lost place in the final furlong. BITSY'S STAR bumped with an
inner rival leaving the gates, chased two wide and between horses approaching the turn, pursued from the three path around the bend, but was outkicked
for minor placings in upper stretch and kept on mildly. COMPUTERIZED brushed the outer part of the gate upon leaving it, pursued from midpack two wide
and between horses and failed to menace. HIT THE BULLSEYE was bumped by rivals on either side at the start, saved ground off of the pace, but was
blocked through upper stretch, tipped out inside the final three sixteenths but lacked a bid. MINE YOUR BIZ bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged
behind into upper stretch and surpassed tired rivals. JACK THE WHISTLE bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, chased through
upper stretch and yielded. LT. TENT bumped an inner rival at the start and made little impact from the three path.

Footnotes
HIGH CRUISE leaned out slightly at the start, set a clear pace while travelling well in the bit, remained in hand around the far turn, then widened under
moderate urging. TWOKO BAY settled off of the pace two wide, cut the corner picking up stride entering the lane, ran on to edge place from an outer rival at
the sixteenth pole and held that position. PALACE KITTEN tracked two to three wide, tipped four wide in upper stretch, then stayed on but was denied
place. FREEDOM FACTOR tracked along the inside, gained place nearing the lane, tipped off the inner rail entering it, but only managed to chase before
yieldind between horses passing the sixteenth pole. AWE SHACKLE stalked outside of the clear leader, then faded between horses after being floated three
wide entering the lane. HARD ATTACK trailed early on, moved out of last around the far turn and made little impact. COLOR FAST lacked speed along the
inside, retreated to trail turning for home and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
SUMMER IN AIKEN set the pace inside of a pressing pair while a path off the inner rail, drew off entering the lane and widened under a drive.
PERFORMANCE PLUS trailed in the two path, moved out of last around the far turn, advanced shifting to the four path in upper stretch and sustained
progress to reach place late. THIS TIME BLUE broke a bit outwardly, tracked in the three path, crept closer along the inside around the far turn, tipped
outside of the top pair to take aim entering the lane, gained place while proving no match for the leader passing the quarter pole but lost that position late.
VICTOR ALY prompted the pace from the three path and between a pair of rivals, sustained pressure under urging around the far turn but gave way
entering the lane. BEER WITH ICE pressed the top pair from the four path, but gave way around the far turn and faded. HANGMAN CREEK broke slowly,
chased along the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
SWEET SASSICAIA showed the way along the inside, drew clear entering upper stretch and held sway. CAVE CREEK tracked from midpack along the
inside, gained place from an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, tipped to chase the clear leader home through the final furlong and held place. JUST
PASSING THRU settled off of the pace along the inside, pursued in the three to four path and among foes around the far turn, altered course in slightly
before splitting foes at the furlong grounds, ran on to bid for place but was kept at bay. MY LITTLE JEN laid off of the pace in the three to four path, floated
seven wide entering the lane and stayed on mildly. QUINN MURPHY broke a step slow, lacked speed in the two path and offered a rail rally. ZOOM ERIN
was tough to load then broke a bit awkwardly, lacked speed tucking from the three to two path around the first turn, awaited racing room behind foes around
the far turn, then chased between horses. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME tracked two wide, tipped to the six path entering the lane, but was outkicked between
horses in midstretch. COINMAKER pressed two wide, but faded after drifting three to five wide in upper stretch. ANGEL OF VERDUN pursued from off of
the pace in the three path and between horses, swung out to the eight path entering the lane and lacked a rally. RICHIES GREAT GIRL tracked along the
inside, gained place entering the lane, but faltered between horses in upper stretch. BROADWAY PEARL laid off of the pace four to three wide and made
little impact. SKYKAT broke a beat slow, lacked speed along the inside and was outrun.

Footnotes
FREEBURN vied for the lead two wide and drew off in upper stretch. ARMY DAY prompted inside of the top pair for a quarter mile, but backed off and lost
position into the turn, tracked from midpack around the bend, shifted to the two path entering the lane, but was denied being allowed racing room to shift out
in upper stretch, committed to an inside charge nearing midstretch and edged place at the sixteenth pole. CUSTOM SUNSHINE stalked three wide, chased
the clearing leader in upper stretch then lost place at the sixteenth pole. LIL CHILLY fidgeted just before the gates sprung, then broke inwardly while off
awkwardly, trailed in the five path and moved up late. TAP GALORE laid off of the pace in the four path, then lacked a bid while hanging on his left lead.
BOHEMIAN JIGGLES vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, then weakened nearing the lane. SHE SMILED AT ME tracked in the three path and
among rivals around the turn but faded entering the lane.

Footnotes
ATHENS MOON showed the way along the inside and held sway under a drive. GOD OF WINE stalked two wide, chased the leader through the lane and
was second best. BETTERA was off awkwardly causing his rider to momentarily dislodge his left iron, recovered and settled off of the pace in the three to
four paths, swung out to the seven path entering upper stretch and ran on willingly for show. RINGSIDE stalked three wide, gained show around the far turn,
but was caught by an outer rival late. PAPA JOJO pursued from midpack two wide, then in the four path around the far turn and lacked a bid. LITTLE NICK
popped open the gate pre-race, laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the lane but lacked a kick between horses in upper stretch and
yielded. HOGSLAYERS R I P stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn and faded. REGIMENTAL bumped with an outer rival at the start, then
steadied whlie towards the rear entering the first turn, then made little impact from the two to three paths. CESNOLA bumped with an inner rival at the start,
then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. SWEET PRESENT trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BEAUMONT RED broke outwardly, pressed outside of the leader, vied with that one around the far turn, dueled through upper stretch, brushed with his
inner counterpart at the sixteenth pole and edged ahead late. EMPIRE'S BEST showed the way, vied with an outer presser around the far turn, scraped the
inner railing after delaying changing leads inside the quarter pole, sparred with his outer counterpart into deep stretch, brushed with that one at the sixteenth
pole and gave in late. ACTIVE DUTY settled off of the pace in the three path, took closer order down the backstretch, tracked the top pair around the far
turn, but chased them in upper stretch, drifted out in midstretch and was best of the rest. RELAMPAGO VERDE was floated out by an inner rival at the start,
lacked speed in the four to three paths, then moved up. CATHY'S BOY trailed along the inside and failed to menace. BLOOD BROTHER tracked along the
inside, chased around the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
FLATTER ME SILLY steadied back soon after the start, lacked speed in the two to three path, trailed turning for home before swinging to the six path
entering the lane, then rallied to bid in the final sixteenth and drove past the leader late. WOOHOO JACKIE BLUE showed the way via a clear margin, held
sway through midstretch, but was collared by an outer bidder in the closing stages. BLISSFUL bumped an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack four
to three wide, tipped to the five path entering the lane, but only offered a mild kick along with an outer rival, failed to match strides with that bidder in the final
furlong and settled for show. BEST PERFORMER tracked along the inside, chased through midstretch but was outkicked by an outer pair passing the
sixteenth pole. ELLE EST FORTE bumped an outer rival at the start, pursued two wide and between horses, then three wide entering the lane, chased
evenly among foes but steadied slightly when put to a bit of crowded quarters at the sixteenth pole. SHIRLEY'S TEMPLE was bumped between horses and
steadied back at the start, trailed in the two path, gained ground around the far turn, then leveled off inside of rivals without reaching contention. COLORS
OF THE WIND laid off of the pace along the inside, then two wide around the far turn and failed to factor. LADY HIDEAWAY stalked two wide, but faded
between horses nearing midstretch. PRINCESS FAWZIA was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, tracked three wide, but faltered between horses
entering the lane.

Footnotes
BIBLEMAN vied between horses, then along the inside around the turn, drew clear entering the lane and lasted safely. HEZA PRIORITY broke a step slow,
raced off of the pace in the two path, shfited to the five path and between horses entering the lane, rallied to gain place in midstretch and was closing in on
the leader late. BOULDERING broke a step slow, chased from off of the pace in the three path, tipped inwardly in midstretch and stayed on. WAITIN' ON A
WOMAN lacked speed along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch, entered the final furlong in the seven path and ran on. FORT BONZ broke slowly,
trailed before swinging to the five path entering the lane, drifted wider in midstretch and moved up. SMOOTH COLLIERY broke a beat slow, laid off of the
pace in the four to six path and lacked a rally. MUCHO MARVIN stalked five to four wide and yielded between horses. WHACUDPOSBLYGOWRNG
prompted four to three wide, then between horses around the turn before weakening in upper stretch. GRAND PRADO vied three to two wide and between
horses but gave way nearing the lane. FIERY PLAYBOY vied along the inside but weakened around the turn.
