run under energetic handling to win going away. MR LAOBAN never far back, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and finished second best. NATURE
OFTHE BEAST pressed the early pace two wide, matched strides through the far turn and into the stretch then was outfinished in the late stages. GRAND
GIZMO sprinted up the inside to make the lead soon after the start, matched strides from the half mile pole until mid stretch then weakened late. YARDMAN
stalked the pace along the inside into the stretch then weakened. PRIVATE CONNIE well placed, stalked the pace three wide and lacked the needed
response. MOON OVER DUBAI was no threat. THE RIDER OF NATURE OFTHE BEAST LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MR
LAOBAN FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. AFTER REVIEW THE STEWARDS TOOK NO ACTION.

TUFF ATTACK broke in front, set all the pace while getting slow fractions, was put to left handed urging at the top of the stretch and drew off under strong
handling. DEJOHN stalked the pace three then two wide and was no match for the winner. MAKING ME CRAZY pressured the winner two wide for nearly a
half, dropped back a bit and shifted outside before the far turn, came on again three wide at the quarter pole then was outfinished. SAY HEY KID trailed
early, moved up along the inside into the far turn then leveled off. PRIVATE LAKE failed to menace. GEH SCHNELL was no factor. ROCK ON KITTEN had
brief speed.

FREE SQUARE prompted the pace two wide, made the lead at the three furlong marker, set the balance of the pace and drew off under right handed urging
to win as much the best. TRIGZ TOO pressed the pace three wide and was no match for the winner while clear for second. UNCLEJACKOMO well placed,
went evenly. SOLITAIRE GAME unhurried early, finished with good courage inside rivals. LAUDA SPEED broke inward bumping HARD N'SWEET at the
start, offered a mild bid five wide into the stretch then failed to sustain that bid. TIDE RISING was no factor. CHACO SPIRIT was no threat. GEMO RAIN
away alertly, set the pace along the inside to the three furlong marker then was used up. HARD N'SWEET was bumped at the start and always outrun.

J P'S GLADYS stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied under right handed urging to make the lead inside the furlong marker and proved best under a
strong hand ride. SHAOLIN never far back, rallied through deep stretch four wide and got up for second. SHELLY THE ROCKET away alertly, battled for the
lead two wide down the backstretch, shook clear on the turn, maintained the advantage until deep stretch then was outfinished. CAGUA well placed, went
evenly. SECRET SEDUCTION failed to menace. AMERICAN BOUND away alertly, gained a slim lead early, matched strides along the into the turn turn,
kept pressure until deep stretch and faded late. ROSE RING was no threat. KAY BEE GEE hopped at the start, dropped out of it on the turn and jogged to

Footnotes
BONNIE'S BEST dueled for the lead two wide then along the inside into the stretch and drew clear late under left handed urging. HOLLYS SUPER STAR
battled with the winner three then two wide until deep stretch and finished second best. PENNY'S TREASURE pressed the pace along the inside through
the turn, shifted out to the three path in upper stretch and faded late. TITEBLUEJEANS stalked the pace four wide into the stretch then weakened. ANGEL'S
DESTINY failed to menace. DEE'S KY WILDCAT was outrun. UNEXPECTEDVALENTYN was fractious in the gate and never threatened.

Footnotes
AMY'S STAR stalked the early pace, closed with a burst of speed three wide into the stretch, made the lead near the three sixteenths pole then widened the
balance of the trip to win as much the best. MERRIEMELOUIE bore in bumping LIGHTENING LOTTIE at the start, was unhurried, closed willingly four wide
through the stretch and finished well clear for second. KISSING MEDALS bumped at the start, prompted the pace two wide down the backstretch, made the
lead at the three furlong marker, set the pace to the top of the stretch then weakened in the final stages. LIGHTENING LOTTIE was bumped at the start and
went evenly. WINGS OF HEAVEN bumped at the start, was well placed then turned in an even effort. RIVER HUSTLER passed tiring rivals. THIRTY
SOMETHING bumped at the start and was no factor. IT'S E Z bumped at the start, sped to the lead soon thereafter, set a pressured pace along the inside
for three furlongs then gave way in the stretch. COWGIRLS HUMOR showed little.
