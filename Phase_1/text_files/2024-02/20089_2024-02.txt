Footnotes
UNIQUE INSIGHT coaxed from the gate, raced three then two wide forwardly placed through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside two then
three wide coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths when taking over command, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a
drive to prevail. EUSEBIUS three wide through the first turn, chased three then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four then three
wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish to secure the place honors. FIRST TRUMPET showed the way in hand along the inside, came under coaxing
just off the inside at the three-eighths under pressure to the outside, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to go, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive and weakened in the late stages. CAROLO RAPIDO four then three wide through the opening bend, chased three to four paths off the
inside down the backstretch and then four to five wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch
and offered no kick. TIMING DIFFERENCE broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs
from home, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. ALLEGRINI chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing midway on
the far turn, spun two to three wide at the head of the stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
ANNA'S WISH showed speed between foes then set the pace, moved to a solo lead late on the backstretch, controlled the action in the two to three path on
the turn, passed the five-sixteenths pole under urging, came under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a left-handed crop at the furlong marker
and drew off under strong urging. ANTENNA pressed the pace on the inside, dropped off the pace late on the backstretch, chased inside on the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, moved out inside the three-sixteenths and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. PROGENY was coaxed
along on the outside, tipped from the three path to the four path early on the turn, shifted to the five path under strong urging late on that bend, moved out in
upper stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. CLASSIC DIVA settled off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, was roused in
the two path on the turn, drifted out six wide under a left-handed crop into upper stretch, switched to a right-handed crop shortly thereafter and came up
empty. SUN AND WIND was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace, dropped back in the three path on the turn and faltered. BUSTIN TIME showed speed
then stalked the pace on the outside, was asked while four wide on the turn and also faltered.

gained the lead into the final sixteenth then moved clear under strong handling. MAMA'S DREAM moved in while going to the front, showed the way with a
clear advantage, went around the turn in the two path, remained on his inside lead in upper stretch, came under a right-handed crop at the furlong marker,
switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole, swapped to the proper lead while being collared into the final sixteenth and was overtaken while
clear for the place. JUDGE RULES settled on the inside of a rival, jostled with that foe near the five-eighths pole, chased in the four path on the turn,
pursued the top two under a drive in the stretch and lacked the needed kick while well clear for the show. MANNY PENNY settled on the outside under
some urging, jostled with an opponent near the five-eighths pole, was urged five wide on the turn and came up empty. NEPTUNE BEACH settled off the
pace, angled in early on the backstretch, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and failed to threaten. IRIE MAN settled well off the pace, saved
ground on the turn, came off the rail outside the quarter-pole, dropped back to the inside into the stretch and was no factor. ARCO AUGUSTA moved out
early then raced on the inside of a rival, was urged along in the two path on the turn and came up empty. AIR FORCE CROSS dropped back between

Footnotes
MY MANE SQUEEZE chased the pace on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, gained to get the lead in upper stretch, shook clear outside the
furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. LANDED prompted the pace on the inside of the leader, took the advantage near the nine-sixteenths,
vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in upper stretch, lost touch with the winner near the furlong marker and proved no match while clear for the
place. BERNIETAKESCHARGE moved out while urged along off the pace, went five then four wide on the turn, dropped to the three path at the
quarter-pole and earned the show while no match for the top two. WALK WITH ME bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the pace, steadied
behind a stopping foe inside the seven-sixteenths pole, moved from the four path to the two path on the turn and lacked the needed response then missed
the show. MIDNIGHT CONCERTO bumped with an opponent at the start, dropped well behind, saved ground for most of the turn then shifted to the three
path, came five wide into the stretch and was no factor. MUNNY GRAB bumped with foes on both sides and was last to commence, raced well off the pace
under urging, moved closer late on the backstretch, angled from the rail to the three path under urging on the turn, chased into the stretch and came up
empty. CARA'S TIME was urged along off the pace, moved from the two path to the four path midway through the turn and failed to respond. BARONESS
BOURBON lost her footing at the start but broke with the field, was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on the turn and failed to threaten.
RUMINT was urged along on the outside, dropped back four to five wide on the turn and capitulated. BLUE EYED WARRIOR went to the front, set the pace
under some pressure to her inside, lost the lead near the nine-sixteenths, came up empty on the turn and stopped fast then was eased in the stretch but
walked off.

trading leans late and gamely prevailed in the final jumps. FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from
DOLLY'S BANK early on and then briefly WAFLR, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, dug in under growing threat to
the outside, dueled inside the final furlong trading leans with the aforementioned foe through to the finish fighting game but was ultimately caught in the final
strides to the wire. WAFLR forwardly placed four wide down the backstretch, briefly advanced to prompt the leader before giving chase tucked to the two
path through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. GOOD REUNION

along the inside early on before being shaken off, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.
