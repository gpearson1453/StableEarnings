kept on while outkicked to the wire in a game effort. MAMITA LINDA swept to lead into first turn, stayed game to wire for show spot. DIVINE EXCHANGE no
speed to the half with a mild gain to improve late going. A REAL HERO settled to far turn never far back, raced along evenly throughout. PRICELESS
PICTURE sharp break from the gate, good position to half, gave in readily. DR. BELLA never menaced throughout. FREE TIME saved ground to far turn
never far back, gave way in the stretch. MY ANGELICA raced back early on with a middle move to far turn, empty late.

Footnotes
GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) unhurried to far turn, rallied on steadily to prevail on the wire in game fashion. EPIMYTHIUM pressed pace early on, blocked
into far turn, steadied off heels, bobbled, recovered quickly while coming on late in a gutsy effort in defeat. ENGLISH CHALLENGE tardy from the gate,
raced far back to quarter pole, ran on to close the gap while coming on quickly too late. P H FACTOR dueled from two path, cleared into far turn, wore down
late. SHORTLIST no speed from outside, raced on from far turn to improve late. HURRY ON OUT raced along evenly to deep stretch, faltered in late going.
MILITARY FORCE ran on evenly throughout with no response when needed. BOITANO never factored throughout. MKAR THE FAST failed to menace
throughout. PUNCH HARD always back with no response when needed. UNANIMOUS CONSENT (GB) tried to keep up for three quarters, gave way
readily stretch. COLBALOAF speed to duel for a half but stopped readily from far turn.

Footnotes
KID MARVELOUS chased pace to deep stretch pushed on and responded well to be along in time under stout handling to wire. BERN N ASH was antsy in
gate with a sluggish start, had an inside run to turn, rallied along with a rush in the stretch too late. NOBLE GENTLEMAN no speed to the turn with a late run
in the stretch run for the third spot. CHITWOOD inside speed to the lead, stayed on past the eighth pole but, gave in late. TARHE good position throughout
with no response in the stretch run. MEADOW VALUE never factored throughout. RATE CONFIRMATION broke tardy while always back thereafter. SAINT
ROCCO could not keep while evenly throughout with no response. LIBERTANGO bit slow start, never menaced throughout.
