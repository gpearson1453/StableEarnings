Footnotes
CAJUN EDDIE vied for the early advantage, saved ground, pulled away and won in hand. FAST VERDICT broke out, challenged on the front end, proved
no match for the winner, but was a clear second. VETERANS DAY brushed at the start, raced in the rear in the beginning, gained ground and was a clear
third. MIND ON MY MONEY raced near the back in the beginning, moved up within contention, hung and lacked a finish. GOTTATAKEHIMTO raced evenly
near the back and was never a factor. INSPECTOR ED showed early speed, raced outside around the first turn and dropped back. NOW NOW MAN void of
early speed and was eased to the wire.

TOTAL SURPRISE unhurried in the beginning, moved up on the outside around the final turn, dueled down the lane with ONE MORE BABY and prevailed
for the win. ONE MORE BABY raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, dueled down the home stretch, was outfinished for the win, but proved
best of others. SMART ANALYSIS raced within contention, made a bid at the head of the final stretch and weakened. MESABI pressed the early pace and
faded. BELLA'S GATSBY lacked early speed, raced outside around the second turn, moved up, but was no factor. XIETELEHUAS void of early speed,
finished wide and passed tired ones. GUEST CHECK raced in the middle of the field in the early part and faded. TIME TO MEDDLE challenged for the early
lead and dropped back after turning for home. FULL OF GLORY went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and retreated to the back of the pack.

on the inside around the turn, proved no match for the winner, but held on for second. ARKANSAS ZONG lacked early speed, made a late inside gain and
was outfinished for second. AUX ARCS challenged for the early advantage, finished wide, weakened and lacked a late kick. DA SOLITARIO dueled on the
front end in the beginning, steadied, while drifting out around the turn and faded. TRIPLE RED ACES pressed the pace, faded and was no threat late.
TOUCHDOWN OKLAHOMA always raced near the back and showed little. ZOEY'S HIPPIE raced near the middle of the field, came around the turn on the
outside and dropped back.

DOCTOR NASH raced within contention, came around the first turn on the outside, moved up, three wide around the final turn, drove clear and was kept to
the task. JOLLY TOMMY raced within striking distance, moved up on the outside around the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of
others. ELUSIVE D'ORO pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout and proved no match for the top two. COOLCROSS vied for the early lead, saved
ground around the second turn, weakened and was outfinished for third. BRIARTOWN lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn and was
never a threat. MOSQUITO FLEET dueled on the front end, saved ground and faded. NAPOLEONIC CODE always raced near the back and was outrun.

Footnotes

middle of the field, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a wide gain and finished willingly. ALL AMERICAN PAT pressed the pace, saved ground
around the turn and was caught for second. MO DIXIE DIVA lacked early speed, showed late interest, but was no real factor. APRIORITY GIRL challenged
on the front end, weakened and was no threat late. GRACE'S SOLDIER raced evenly near the middle of the field and lacked a bid. SWEET STORMY ELLE
pressed the early pace and faded. DON'T LOOK ETHEL void of early speed and was never close. THIRSTYPROSPECT raced within striking distance,
came around the turn wide and dropped back. CHACHA TO CATALINA always raced in the back and was distanced to the wire.
