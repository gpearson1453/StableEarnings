ELIMINATE coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to
take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and gamely fended off that rival to prevail safely at the end. LASER SHARP chased four then three wide
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths and bidding three wide for command five-sixteenths from home, took over command swinging five wide into
upper stretch, dug in under lone threat and was collared near the eighth pole, fought on inside gamely to the finish well clear of the rest and along second
best. APURO coaxed from the start, raced three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch and weakened. HEARD ON THESTREET chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper
stretch, tired. MISTER B showed the way in hand just off the inside and then along the inside, came under coaxing near the five-sixteenths when under
pressure from a pair of rivals, yielded the front nearing the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
WHENLOVETAKESOVER lunged inward at the start and brushed the gate then bumped the hindquarters of a foe, was off slow and spotted the front a few
lengths,had the rider reach down to adjust his left iron, tossed his head while moving up rankly under restraint, was put in crowded quarters by the leader
near the eleven-sixteenths and steadied some then dropped back, steadied again when a foe dropped back in front late on the backstretch, was roused
while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, rallied outside to get the lead outside the furlong marker, moved clear approaching the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady urging. NO SURRENDER showed speed on the inside of a foe, moved in near the eleven-sixteenths
and put to the winner in crowded quarters, disputed the pace on the inside of an opponent, dropped back with a half-mile to run, chased inside to the two
path on the turn, pursued the leader while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and was second best. LITTLE SKIPPY stalked the pace on the outside,
tucked in behind a foe near the nine-sixteenths, ranged up three wide on the turn, made a bid with three furlongs to run, took the lead while asked outside
the quarter-pole, lost the lead under a drive outside the furlong marker and tired but held the show. A LISTER was bumped in the hindquarters at the start,
settled off the pace, was urged along passing the five-eighths pole, shifted from the rail to the three path on the turn, drifted in outside the furlong marker,
moved out outside the sixteenth-pole and failed to threaten. GROWTH MINDSET dropped back near the three-quarter pole then was urged along, went four
wide for most of the turn then moved to the five path and lacked the needed response. FLUORESCENT BAY dropped back after the start, brushed with a
rival outside the three-quarter pole, raced at the rear, was hard ridden in the four path on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, remained on his inside
lead in the drive and was no factor. MODEL S brushed with a rival outside the three-quarter pole, contested the pace between foes then outside a rival
beginning near the five-eighths pole, moved to a solo lead with a half-mile to run, vied in the two path while challenged again on the turn, was roused near
the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
TO A T broke at the rear of the field, moved out then was ridden along off the pace, advanced on the outside late on the backstretch, chased in the three
path on the turn, took the lead under a drive into upper stretch, responded well in the final furlong and held under steady urging. TIMED OUT was hustled
from the gate, moved up on the outside to get the lead outside the five-eighths pole, went clear before the nine-sixteenths, traveled around the turn in the
two path, was asked under threat coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, chased that foe into the final furlong,
moved out while keeping on around the sixteenth-pole and willingly earned the place. TRADE SECRET settled towards the rear, was urged along late on
the backstretch, went three wide for most of the turn then dropped to the two path, angled out outside the furlong marker and improved for the show. DIVA
BANKER was taken in hand when the leader crossed in front early then was well placed, dropped back late on the backstretch, went two then three wide on
the turn, came four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. RED PEPPER GRILL broke near the back of the field, was urged along on the
outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. SLACK TIDE angled in while going to the front, put a foe
in crowded quarters near the three-quarter-pole, lost the advantage outside the five-eighths pole, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, chased inside for
most of the turn then moved to the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch and weakened. VALLARAND broke out and hit the gate, chased the
pace, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to respond. SWEET AS SUGAR was
hustled from the gate, showed speed on the inside of a foe, steadied while put in crowded quarters against the rail near the three-quarter pole then dropped
back, fell further back late on the backstretch, moved from the rail to the three path on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
CITY BLOCKS chased six paths off the inside down the backstretch before advancing four wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter
pole, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive surging late outside a pair of rivals and was just up to prevail. GEOPOLITICS bobbled and was
bumped at the start by PEONY, who broke inwards, showed the way in hand just off the inside down the backstretch before tucking inside through the turn,
came under pressure from a trio and clung to command spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat through the length of
the stretch and was nailed in the final jumps to the finish. PEONY broke in at the start bumping GEOPOLITICS, chased four then three wide advancing to
pressure the leader under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, dug in under a drive on near even terms a furlong out, then was
ultimately repelled in the late stages between foes while well clear of the rest. AUNT YOLA got steadied out at the start when pinched between foes
conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper stretch
and kept on under a drive to the finish. STRESS RELIEVER chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the
turn coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung three wide for home and made no impact. WELCOME BACK BABE coaxed from the gate,
chased three then two wide in closest aim of the leader, came under coaxing three furlongs from home between foes now among a quartet through the latter
portion of the turn vying for the front, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, tipped to the four path near the eighth pole and weakened in the final furlong.
MANGIA coaxed from the start, chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, came under
coaxing near the three-eighths, angled three to four wide for home and weakened. ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE showed brief speed two then three wide, came
under coaxing tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths and retreated through the turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
HIGH HEAT was hustled to the front, showed the way with some company to his outside, moved to a solo lead near the nine-sixteenths, controlled the
action in the three path on the turn, was asked outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, responded well when put to the crop inside the
three-sixteenths pole and drew off under strong urging. TOMMY GUN bobbled at the start, pressed then chased the pace on the outside, went around the
turn in the four path, was driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. CHARLIE
FIVE O tracked the pace on the outside then in the five path on the turn, was given his cue near the five-sixteenths, chased in the six path under the crop
into the stretch, pursued the winner into the final furlong and weakened while clear for the show. ANYTHING PAZIBLE was urged along at the rear, traveled
around the turn in the two path, came three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. JOKER BOY was ridden along towards the back, went three then
four wide on the turn and was no factor. QUICKFLASH moved in early then was coaxed along off the pace, dropped back while saving ground on the turn
and had nothing left.

Footnotes
SUNDAY GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, moved up to press the pace, vied outside of a foe while in the four then three path on the turn, took the lead
at the quarter-pole, shook clear under the crop nearing the furlong marker then drifted in and drew away under steady urging. DOLCE VELOCE showed
speed then moved up to contest the pace, took the lead near the nine-sixteenths, vied in the three then two path on the turn, was asked near the
five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner at the quarter-pole, dropped back near the furlong marker then moved out and proved no match while able
to hold the place. BOOK OF WISDOM was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, rounded the turn in the two path, was driven three wide into
the stretch and got up for the show. SONIA'S FLAME tracked the pace on the outside, chased five then four wide on the turn, floated six wide into the
stretch and tired. ELITE STATUS was urged along off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed
response. APOLLONIA C chased the pace, moved up between foes near the nine-sixteenths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn and came up
empty. MARY UNION AVE broke in and bumped with a rival, was urged along at the rear, went four then five wide on the turn, came six wide into the
stretch and was no factor. LA DECENTE was ridden along towards the rear, moved from the rail to the three path midway through the turn and failed to
threaten. INFLAMMABELLE showed speed then was taken in hand near the five-eighths pole, came under urging then chased the pace, dropped back two
then three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. TROUBLED LUCK tossed his head just before the start but broke very fast, was
guided in quickly early, showed the way, lost the lead near the nine-sixteenths, came up empty along the rail on the turn and retreated.
