LUNCH LADY went to the front, drove clear, was all out and held on well. BLACK ACE hopped at the start, racing in the back, saved ground around the
turn, made a late bid and was outfinished for the win. DODGEBALL hopped at the start, racing in the rear, moved up on the outside around the turn, made a
wide bid, proved no match for the top two, but was a clear third. TENPINS TEMPEST raced in the middle of the field, came around the turn on the outside
and finished evenly. SAVANNAH'S HERE void of early speed, came around the turn wide and was no threat. CHEER UP raced within contention and faded.
MOODY RAFAELA pressed the early pace, dropped back and was outrun.

saved ground around the final turn and weakened. SARA'S SAPPHIRE pressed the early pace, dropped back and was no threat late. SEE SASSY RUN
raced evenly near the back and was never a serious threat. MEAN AMERICAN challenged for the early advantage, saved ground and dropped back.

Footnotes
MY LUCKY BREAK vied for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the lane and drove clear late under strong handling. SHEZA
HOT STORM challenged on the front end, saved ground around the turn, dueled down the stretch and proved no match for the winner. STAND BY TIME
lacked early speed, saved ground around the turn, made a late rail bid and was a clear third. FAYE L. raced within contention, came around the turn off the
rail and weakened down the stretch. TUSCAN RULES raced within striking distance, weakened and finished evenly. LESLIE'S MISCHIEF void of early
speed and was never close. WIND OF WAR broke open the gates before the start, always raced near the back and showed little. DISCREET DEAL raced in
the middle of the field, dropped back and was outrun.

win. KASENS TRIBE challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn and couldn't keep up with the top two. LA LOLA vied for the early
lead, dueling with SURREY, weakened and was no threat late. ABBEY CAKES showed early speed, faded and finished evenly. RONA VISION void of early
speed, finished wide and was no factor. ALTAR GIRL raced evenly near the back, came around the first turn four wide and showed little. VOTE BY MAIL

Footnotes
BODE'S LIGHT dueled on the front end, raced four wide around the first turn, took command around the final turn, drove clear and won under steady urging.
PAYNT BATTLE raced within contention, made a late bid, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. BIG ROJO raced evenly near the back in
the beginning, made a late gain, but proved no match for the top two. SPHEROID lacked early speed, came around the second turn wide, showed late
interest, but was no factor. DEALIN' STELEN lacked early speed, improved position, but was no factor. GETCHA raced near the middle of the field and put
forth an even effort. J C'S IN TOWN vied for the early lead, saved ground around the final turn, faded and was no threat late. FLASHY PREMO challenged
for the early advantage and dropped back. TAKEN BACK void of early speed, was never close and eased to the wire. GUITARZAN dueled on the front end,
dropped back and was eased to the wire.

the final turn and weakened. HE'S CHARMING lacked early speed, raced outside around the first turn, improved position, but was no factor. SMACKOVER
