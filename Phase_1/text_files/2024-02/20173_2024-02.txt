Footnotes
MEAN JAKEY away in good order, dueled up front off the inside, continued to alternate through the turn and into the stretch, held a slight advantage past
the furlong marker, continued with good perseverance to the wire to narrowly last and gain the nod. PICO D'ORO back off the pace just off the inside,
steered out three wide turning for home, rallied on the outside, closed the gap late on the dueling leaders, just missed. INDULGE broke a step slow, lacked
speed in the two path, advanced from between horses into the stretch, inside rally stretch, finished willingly while too late for the top pair. MIDNIGHT
MAJESTY broke on top, dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to battle late, weakened in the late stages to lose a couple of positions. CITY OF
CLOUDS raced back off the pace outside, three path through the turn, lacked a closing response. HUSKER BUTCH in the main body while four wide
through the turn, also came up empty for the drive. FOREVER COOL hesitated at the break to spot the field a couple of lengths, remained back. CAPTAIN
JACK chased the dueling leaders up the backstretch from along the inside, began to back up through the turn, continued that retreat in the drive.

Footnotes
COLONEL BARTON forwardly placed from the start while between horses, advanced on the winner in the turn from the outside, took over late in the bend,
kicked steadily clear through the stretch under steady handling. BRAHMS IMAGE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch inside, responded when
confronted by the winner in the turn, lost contact with that one nearing the furlong marker, enough left to last for the place. MR. COUGAR off a step slow,
lagged well back ,for a half, two path out of the turn, rallied through and outside of traffic to finished up willingly and be in time for the show, getting to the
runner up. KINFOLK settled off the pace inside, moved closer along the rail late in the turn, failed to sustain that advance through the lane. PEPPERONIKID
raced in the second flight while in the two path, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly.. MADMARTIGAN within striking distance three wide, shuffled
slightly early in the turn, asked, moved a bit closer while angling four wide turning for home, went flat to the wire. POINT BLANK in the second flight while
widest and four wide, carried out five wide into the stretch, tired. WICKED PRINCE back off the pace and the inside, three wide early turn, two path exiting,
no rally. WATER TO WINE made little impact while racing toward the inside. PARTYINTHESTREETS in mid pack and off the inside, tired through the
stretch. WHONEW was always outrun while racing three wide. SINGING GROOM was finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
GLADRIEL broke on top, soon sprinted clear, set all the pace, held off the runner up late under steady handling. VOW behind the first flight while saving
some ground, crept closer along the rail late in the turn, shifted out a bit nearing the furlong marker, roused soon after, closing the gap on the winner late
while outside that one. TAKING CHARGE DESI broke with field, prompted the issue from the second flight while widest up the backstretch, five down to
three wide when chasing the winner through the turn, raced on equal terms with the runner up past the furlong marker then flattened late, remained clear of
the others. SHELL SHOCK broke back, lacked any speed for a half, two path into the lane, improved position through traffic while not a serious threat to the
top three. NAVAGATIONALBEACON forwardly placed out in the strip, four wide far turn, two path and behind the winner turning for home, came up empty
the final furlong. ALMOST DIALED OUT in mid pack while racing off the inside, lacked a response in the drive. SWEET NELLIE saved ground to no avail in
an even effort. SODDY DAISY in the main group and between horses for a half, also failed to muster a rally. CHAPARRITA forwardly placed up the
backstretch between horses, in tight, steadied with a half mile remaining, came five wide for the drive, no response. FUNTIMEGIRL was finished early while
four wide through the turn. SWEET DYNASTY off a step slow, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
CHAPEL BARN dueled early off the inside, cleared to the inside late in the first turn, set the pace, continued to show the way through the final turn and into
the stretch, drifted out to bother a tiring pursuer past the furlong marker, was straightened and had enough left to last. MYSTERY MO void of speed off the
inside, asked along midway on the final turn in the two path, split foes when advancing past the furlong marker, dropped inside and continued willingly to the
wire along the rail to be closing the gap on the winner. WARTIME HERO settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground far turn, angled out three wide
when moving closer between calls then flattened out in the drive. KHOZY MY BOY settled off the pace and the inside, three to four wide late in the final turn,
went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing bid. WINDCRACKER dueled early inside the winner, moved out and chased that one the middle half mile,
bid second turn, dueled upper stretch, tiring when bothered by the drifting winner a furlong out, continued to weaken. DEVIL VISION broke in the air, void of
speed inside, passed tiring rivals while not a threat. CYCLONE restless just prior to the start, hesitated at the break, trailed well back, also picked off some
faltering rivals after the issue had been decided. GET BACK GOLDIE remained back while racing three. COLOSI saved ground was never a threat.
BEAVER HAT settled off the pace, gave way through the stretch.

Footnotes
IDALOU back off the pace and the inside, began a steady gain after a quarter, three wide through the turn, took over inside the furlong marker then had
enough left to withstand a furious late charge from the runner up. WOWSERS bothered at the break, fell far back, began to move midway on the turn,
moved out for the drive, turned in spirited late rally to be rapidly getting to the winner while blowing by the next two rivals in the waning strides. MIESHA
broke in to bother the runner up, raced back, three to four wide out of the turn, finished up willingly to finish up best of the rest. ART QUEEN in mid pack off
rail, came three wide into the lane, improved into the lane, flattened out in the final furlong. MISS ESCAPADE away well, raced forwardly in the second flight
up the backstretch three wide, angled in a bit and engaged the leader to duel through the turn, disposed of that foe upper stretch, offered little resistance to
the winner past the furlong marker then weakened. OPPOSITE THE CROWD lacked speed while off rail after breaking slowly, three to four wide into the
lane in improving a bit, evenly out the final furlong. NO PAY NO HAY settled off the early pace inside, lacked room from between horses late in the turn,
came three wide for the drive, lacked a response when clear. RED VOLTA behind the first flight up the backstretch inside, began a steady retreat before a
half. DIXIE RAG broke back and was never a threat. J J'S JOY broke sharp, quickly clear, dueled closest to the inside, gave way when straightened for
home. CATALINA SUNRISE fell back and was never involved. RITA'S REVENGE prompted the issue with some early foot and stopped.

Footnotes
NACHO CHROME tracked the pace from along the inside, continued to save ground into the far turn, steered out three wide turning for home, engaged the
leader from the outside nearing midstretch, wore that foe down under steady handling. GOLDEN DIVERSION pressed the issue off the inside, asked along
and lodged a bid three wide turning for home, took over, briefly clear upper stretch, offered brief resistance to the winner soon after then could not keep up.
OUR HEAVENLY GIFT broke on top, showed the way into the first turn, set the pace inside, began to weaken when headed midway on the final turn, lasted
for the show. PREACHER'S KID four wide in the first turn when off the pace, closer before a half, challenged in the two path final turn, led, relinquished to
the runner up upper stretch and faltered. OUTLAW RUN lacked early foot toward the inside, continued to save a little ground into the far turn, improved
position with some mild interest, no real threat. SATURDAY STARTER lacked speed well out in the strip early, four to six wide through the first turn, four
wide through much of the second bend, lacked a closing kick. HARD LUCK HENRY in mid pack while off the inside, saved ground through the second bend,
failed to muster a rally. BUBBY BOY six wide into the first turn, remained back in failing to threaten. DEVIL'S SHADOW unprepared for the start, well back,
trailed, picked off some tiring rivals to improve position while never a threat. BOOTS N BOURBON off slow, raced back and was always outrun. NATIVE
MOONSHINE seven wide into the first turn, angled in, four wide onto the backstretch, angled in a bit for the second turn and retreated. CAPITAL CAUSE
five wide into the first turn, stopped after a half, jogged in.

Footnotes
AFLEET SKY never far back while three wide through the first turn, continued to stalk the leader up the backstretch, two path through the second turn,
moved on the leader turning for home, bid on the outside, wore that rival under steady handling. MIDNIGHT TAXES took control soon after the start, set the
pace just off the inside, continued to show the way into and through the final turn, could not match the winner the final furlong, remained well clear for the
place. STUCK N SNOW broke back, five wide into the first turn, angled in, advanced three wide through the second bend, saw that progress stall the final
furlong, narrowly lasted for the show. TWENTY TO PARK four wide in the first turn when with the second flight, four wide again in the second bend when
between foes, lost some ground to the two leaders into the lane, slowly gaining for the show late while never a threat to that top pair. HIGHTAIL COWBOY
five wide through the first turn when off the pace, continued well wide, five path again through the final turn, lacked a closing kick. WHERE'S RANDY settled
off the pace inside, saved ground through the second turn, had little left for the stretch run. READY SHOES broke back, lacked speed, went one paced the
final three furlongs while racing just off the inside. IMPLICATOR last to leave, trailed, passed tiring rivals while never a threat. BACKGATE RED was never
involved. JACKS SPRING BREAK forwardly placed early, steady retreat. JIM NED was finished after a half.

BEN FRANKLIN outrun early while four wide into the first turn, began to move three wide far turn, swung out five wide turning for home, bid, edged clear
under steady handling. MOUNT CRAIG moved up to be a pace factor off the inside, dueled the middle half closest to the inside, could not match the winner
late, remained clear for the place. CROSSING in tight along the rail and in traffic first turn while firmly in hand, two path and additional traffic second bend
when in the two path, went evenly when clear for the drive. PURSUIT OF POWER pressed the issue up front from along the inside, continued to save
ground through the second turn, gradually weakened through the stretch. QUALITY WEST four wide into the first turn, four wide again in the second bend,
had little left for the stretch run. OLIVIER five wide into the first turn when forwardly placed, angled in a bit to vie three wide the middle half mile then faltered
in the drive. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE last to leave, moved up to race in mid pack, raced three wide through the final turn, had nothing for the drive. P R
CALL ME MAYBE fell back to trail before a half, made little impact. EDDIE LEA remained always back. EMPYREAL SHADOW broke back and was never a
factor while five to four wide second turn.

Footnotes
SILVER PROSPECTOR outrun in the early going, advanced into contention with a three wide middle move, challenged on the outside far turn, took over
under confident handling with a quarter to run, clear upper stretch, held the runner up safe late under steady handling. GREAT ESCAPE in the second flight
inside, angled out three wide late in the final turn, chased the winner past the furlong marker, could manage little in the way of any late gain. LOGICAL
MYTH pressed the issue up front off the inside, challenged between foes and inside the winner second turn, could not keep up with that one into the lane
nor contain the runner up, lasted for the show. AIN'T LIFE GRAND void of speed, continued to race back, four wide into the stretch, displayed some mild
interest to improve position, not a serious threat. PRESIDENTIAL settled off the pace and the inside, displayed some mild late interest to improve a bit, not a
serious threat. PATS PROPERTY sprinted clear early, set the pace along the inside, faltered when headed in the far turn. INJUNCTION last to leave, trailed
throughout to be never a threat. BRIGADIER GENERAL forwardly placed three wide, retreated.

Footnotes
HEROIC MOVE settled off the pace toward but not on the inside, moved closer while remaining in the two path through the second turn, engaged the leader
in upper stretch and powered by under firm handling. CAPTIVATING BOY quickly sprinted clear after the start, extended that advantage in the run up the
backstretch, continued to maintain daylight into the far turn, offered little resistance to the winner when than one challenged in upper stretch, remained well
clear of the others. TEN DAYS LATER lacked early foot inside, continued to save ground far turn, moved closer along the rail with a quarter to run, proved
no match for the top two in the drive, held sway for the show. INEXORABLE void of early foot, behind considerable traffic late in the second turn, in tight,
waited, split foes upper, improved position. CITY LEGEND broke back, lacked speed, three wide and also in traffic late in the second turn, improved position
as well when clear. INTERLOCK EMPIRE back off the early pace, saved ground second turn, in tight along the rail, improved inside of some rivals into the
lane, went flat to the wire. MAZING MARK main body while three wide, fanned five wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. NIP N TUCK chased the runner
up while three wide in the second flight, gave way turning for home. MAGOO also in the second flight in pursuit of the leader, between horses into the far
turn, had little left for the drive as well. CATDADDY off a step slow, raced back, moved out, four to five wide second turn, failed to rally. NEXT REVOLT tired
after racing four to five wide through the turns.
