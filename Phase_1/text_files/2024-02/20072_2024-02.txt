Footnotes
SPYCRAFT showed speed from between horses, controlled all the pace to the stretch and held sway to the wire under good handling. STONEVICIOUS
broke poorly outside, ran on for place, declared a non starter. GRANDE TORTUGON (CHI) ran back to stretch, rallied along to improve to wire. STOP
HAMMERTIME no speed to the turn, closed the gap in the stretch run. AKAMAI just off top pair, chased into the stretch, gave in late stages. SARGEANT
BARGER good position off rail run to the stretch, weakened in late going. BONNIE BILL slow start from the gate, tried to keep up at the half, ran on stretch,
in tight clipped heels late stretch run lost best chance. LOUISIANIMAL brief inside speed, dueled to the half, gave in readily. AFTER A STEWARDS
INQUIRY INTO THE START, STONEVICIOUS WAS DECLARED A NON STARTER DUE TO A GATE MALFUNCTION.
