Footnotes
AZAMANA EMPIRE no hurry to the turn, angled out with four wide run to clear late. LADY LIVERMORE had a awkward start chased leader to turn, kept on
for place. BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE quick speed to the front, controlled pace to stretch, weakened. LUCKY ANA bobbled from the gate, regrouped quickly,
closed the gap late. RECOGNIZE ME saved ground to stretch with no late kick when needed. ROCK THE NILE bit tardy from gate, never menaced
throughout. SURE ENOUGH tried to keep up for a half, ran out of steam in the stretch run.

CHOP CHOP no hurry early on with an off rail run to far turn, kept on confidently in the stretch to clear off at the wire. FLASHY GEM off rail position to far
turn ran on steadily in stretch no match. ICICLES speed to the front, well rationed on lead to far turn, weakened. NAPA CANDY antsy in the gate, broke well
while going evenly throughout. BALI BELLE went along evenly throughout with no response in the stretch. THISNAMEISOKAY chased leader to the half but
retreated from quarter pole to wire. YES DAY always trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SUNDAY SHOES trapped inside early while shuffled back, angled out for run into the turn, blocked mid stretch, bulled way through, kept on and proved tons
the best under stout handling to the wire. PEACOCK LASS ran up behind leaders with no room, shuffled, angled in no match. ERNA had a forward trip
outside to turn, ran on in the stretch for the show position with a good effort. PAMMY'S READY no speed to the turn, rallied along to improve in the stretch
run. UP AND DOWN dueled from inside to stretch with nothing left to tire late. SECRET OPERATION no speed to the turn, rallied along and moved up in
the stretch. MRS. GREEN raced along evenly with no response when needed from the turn. TAP DANCING LADY had an awkward start from the gate, ran
on from the turn in even fashion while never a real threat. HONEY HAULER never menaced throughout. MUSIC FESTIVAL was slow into stride from inside,
never reached contention with no response. BLACK FOREST chased from three path, dueled into the turn, gave in stretch. NIGHT LIVIN dueled in two path
early, could not keep up stopped readily in the stretch while far back to the wire. PER RULING ECM2024-110 FROM HIWU, ERNA WAS DISQUALIFIED
FROM 3rd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.
