Footnotes
SUMMER LAKE away quickly to take control, pressured from outside around the bend, carried a short lead into the lane, shook free in upper stretch and
was kept to task to the wire. UNCONTROLLABLE settled off the pace, moved into the two path and raced outside a rival through the turn, spun three wide
into the lane, angled out in the drive and rallied to best the others. QUEEN OF POMPEII got bumped around between rivals at the start, saved ground
racing out of range through the turn, moved off the fence crossing the dirt, steered out further in the lane, summoned a mild rally but was outkicked for
second. SATOSHI bumped QUEEN OF POMPEII twice at the start, raced in range three deep through the turn, moved in the lane and lacked a bid while
getting outfinished for second and third. ILLHAVEANOTHERKISS chased outside a rival early, drew alongside the leader early on the turn, kept the
pressure on to the top of the stretch, then failed to kick on with the winner and weakened in the furlong grounds. ISSA COURT brushed leaving the gate,
chased from inside, moved off the rail into the lane, altered from behind rival back to the inside in upper stretch and had little left for the late stages. SONG
OF SHADOWS forwardly placed in the early going, took the turn two wide then came three wide into the stretch and weakened. WARRIOR LADY lagged
behind early, trailed two to three wide into the stretch and was never a factor.

Footnotes
ISLAND CRUISER sprinted to the front then crossed over once clear of inner rival, set all the pace to the stretch, asked left handed then switched to the
right with a sixteenth remaining and stayed clear to the wire. FAST CHAZ raced up close from outside, closest in pursuit through the turn, took aim two wide
into the stretch but lacked the needed late punch in the furlong grounds. MR FABRICATOR showed early speed inside ISLAND CRUISER early then got
crowded by that rival and ceded command, chased along the fence to the stretch and finished evenly late. BARTHOLDY chased out of range off the rail,
took the turn three then two wide, came out and bumped rival at the top of the lane and kept on for a minor award. GAZON (GB) tracked off the rail then
three deep past the half-mile pole, continued three wide through the turn, got bumped by BARTHOLDY at the top of the stretch and could not rally.
LAUGIER NIGHT (IRE) was off slow to begin, climbed briefly when crossing the dirt, pulled the rider into range up the backstretch, chased two wide
between rivals around the turn and weakened. CLASSIC ALPHIE brushed the gate to lose a step at the start then lacked speed and dropped far back,
trailed two wide into the stretch and never got involved.

Footnotes
MONTANA stalked three to four wide early, bid four deep at the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the top pair past the five-sixteenths marker, came again to
confront the top pair from outside in upper stretch, cleared midstretch and stayed strong to the wire. HOTROD RIDE chased two to three wide around the
clubhouse turn, launched a bid leaving the backstretch, put a head in front briefly entering the stretch but was overtaken by MONTANA shortly after and
stayed on to secure the place. FIFTY CINCO dueled from outside into the first turn then pressed from outside, took over entering the far turn, vied inside
rivals around the bend, dueled into the stretch, relinquished the lead at the top of the lane and flattened to third. CONFUCIUS broke a step slow, trailed four
to five wide on the first turn, chased in range while remaining widest up the backstretch, entered the far turn six wide, exited that bend four wide and tired.
INCREDIBE MO dueled from inside then inched ahead around the clubhouse turn, set the pressure pace up the backstretch, lost command at the
seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back on the far turn and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
BELLABEL (IRE) away quickly and crossed over to the inside, controlled the pace up the backstretch and far turn, came off the rail a bit late on the far turn,
drifted out through the lane and managed to stay clear to the wire. MOUFFY coaxed from the gate, checked off heels and became rank shortly after,
continued to fight the rider around the clubhouse turn, tugged along up the backstretch and behind the pacesetter on the far turn, drifted out approaching the
stretch, steered out in the lane and finished willingly for second. JUSTIQUE forwardly placed three deep into the first turn then took a stalking position,
continued in the three path on the far turn, got floated out entering the lane, moved out further in the drive and missed second. NADETTE (FR) chased three
then two wide at the back in the beginning, trailed two then shifted to the three path at the quarter pole, swung out into the stretch and showed late effort to
earn a minor award. YERWANTHERE (IRE) rank prior to the clubhouse turn, chased two wide then moved inside, saved ground to the stretch, chased
within striking range with a furlong remaining but needed to find more late. CLOSING REMARKS tracked in the three path early, rounded the far turn two
wide, angled out into the stretch, steered back in some in the lane and kept trying to the wire. OAKHURST raced up close outside the leader into the first
turn, closest in pursuit up the backstretch and second bend, got floated out by MOUFFY approaching the stretch and weakened down the lane.

Footnotes
NYSOS stalked two then three wide around the clubhouse turn, tracked outside a rival up the backstretch, coaxed along in the two path then roused three
wide approaching the quarter pole, swept by the top pair entering the stretch, kicked clear while drifting over to the inside in upper stretch, powered away
under hand urging and coasted in late. WINE ME UP coaxed from the gate, raced up close on the inside then steered off the rail and went up to press the
leader midway around the clubhouse turn, lost touch with the leader early on the backstretch, challenged again between rivals nearing the far turn, failed to
kick on with SCATIFY midway around the bend, chased the new leader into the stretch and finished willingly to edge SCATIFY for second. SCATIFY
sprinted to the front from outside and angled over to the rail around the first turn before taking pressure from WINE ME UP, cleared that rival early on the
backstretch, confronted by a pair of rivals at the seven-sixteenths pole, moved clear midway around the far turn, overtaken by NYSOS entering the stretch
and got outkicked by WINE ME UP for the place honors. MC VAY tracked four then five wide early, chased three wide into the far turn, drifted while starting
to lose ground around the bend and churned on for a minor award. MOONLIT SONATA settled in the two path in the early going, rounded the far turn two to
three wide and lacked a rally down the lane. BETTER THAN GOLD trailed two then three wide early, remained well off the rail up the backstretch, moved
back to the three path for the far turn and could not make an impact. ACE OF CLUBS tucked inside for the clubhouse turn, chased off the pace then moved
into range in the middle stages, stayed on the fence to the stretch and came up empty.

TAKE CHARGE CURLY climbed in the three path early, gained ground up the backstretch, went four wide into the far turn, angled down to the two path
while ridden along, steered back out into the stretch, challenged four deep at the sixteenth pole and edged ARREST in the closing moments. ARREST
chased four deep around the clubhouse turn, three deep on the second bend, took over with a furlong remaining but was outkicked in deep stretch.
SYNTACTIC broke a step slow then was hustled along the rail chasing into the first turn, sent for the front and cleared approaching the backstretch,
pressured by THRUST on the far turn, relinquished the lead at the top of the stretch, stayed on from inside and held third. THRUST led two wide into the
first turn then lost command and stalked up the backstretch, challenged from outside on the far turn, carried a short lead two wide into the lane, lost
command in upper stretch and faltered late. RUSTY B CAUSE antsy in the gate, forwardly placed three deep early, moved inward and saved ground along
the rail on the far turn, then weakened in the drive. TAHOE SECRETS antsy in the gate, chased two wide early on, trailed from the rail then two wide on the
far turn, moved out in the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
GOLIAD cleared early and moved inside, opened up around the first turn, padded the lead up the backstretch, increased the margin further around the far
turn, put to right handed urging in upper stretch and held comfortably under a strong drive to the wire. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) stalked along the inside
into the first turn, remained on the fence chasing well off the pace up the backstretch and far turn, finished determinedly under right handed through the lane
but could only whittle the gap on the winner. AH JEEZ settled inside, saved ground through the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and gained the show.
TIO MAGICO unhurried in the beginning and moved into the two path, traveled three deep on the second bend and lacked a rally. BALNIKHOV (IRE) trailed
on the inside to the quarter pole, angled three wide into the lane and failed to threaten. GREAT KING (FR) pulled early then settled in the two path, came
four wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact. TIME TO PARTY tracked outside a rival around the clubhouse turn, continued two wide into the
second bend then chased between rivals and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
HULA CANDY tracked two wide early, spun three wide into the stretch, moved out in the lane and reeled in CALM SEA late. TRULY QUALITY traveled in
the two path near the back, angled out leaving the far turn and spun five wide into the stretch, drifted in and bothered a rival midstretch, continued to drift in
and bumped another past the sixteenth pole and rallied for second. CALM SEA set the pace from inside under pressure, dueled into and around the far turn,
cleared in upper stretch, showed the way into the final sixteenth and was run down late. CATALINA EDDY stalked from inside, roused leaving the far turn,
put to right handed urging in upper stretch still on the fence, then tipped out and finished willingly between rivals late. CITY EXILE (GB) came away slow,
tucked inside in mid-pack, shifted two wide near the quarter pole, moved out in the lane and started to rally, took a bump from TRULY QUALITY past the
sixteenth pole and kept on for a minor award. STAMP MY PASSPORT pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn, lost contact with the
pacesetter in upper stretch, stayed on through the final furlong but lost positions late. LIVING LIFE was off slow in the beginning, trailed inside then two wide
into the lane, altered out wide in midstretch and finished with a mild rally. VANTASTIC tucked inside towards the rear, saved ground through the far turn,
found traffic in upper stretch, moved out and chased between rivals late. AUSPICIOUS STYLE rated on the inside, coaxed along on the far turn while
continuing to save ground and lacked a rally in the drive. SYDNEY STREET (GB) chased between rivals early then got put in tight and steadied into the
clubhouse turn, traveled in mid-pack outside a rival in the middle stages, rounded the far turn three then four deep, got put in tight between rivals midstretch
and coasted in late. SANTO DIOS (ARG) stalked outside rivals then moved into the two path on the first turn, rounded the far turn four then three wide and
