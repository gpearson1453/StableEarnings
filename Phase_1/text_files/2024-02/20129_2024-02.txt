Footnotes
MR. HOUGHTON stalked the early pace three wide, then was four wide on the turn, made a bid by the quarter pole, then had a long drive and was up late
to prove best. UNCLE GEORGY set a pressured pace while three to two wide and trying to get out on the turn, then drifted out leaving the turn and then dug
in gamely in the drive and just missed late while on the left lead. BAZINGA D pressed the pace along the inside and faded late, bested rest. FILTHY RICH
tracked the pace along the inside but lacked the needed bid. BOOK RUNNER was reserved early, came five wide into the lane and had a late rally. BRADY
chased the early pace and weakened. NOT TODAY GOVERNOR was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and was never a threat.

LORD WINSALOT vied for the early lead three wide, then dueled for command and made a two wide bid on the far turn to be clear off the turn, then
remained clear to the wire to prove best under a drive. NICK PAPAGIORGIO was reluctant to load, settled on the inside, saved ground on the far turn,
advanced off the turn and shifted out nearing the sixteenth marker and closed well. CAERUS was well rated early on the inside, eased out on the far turn
and was three wide by the quarter pole, made a bid in the lane but needed more. HIDDEN PROMISE tracked the pace four wide and came five wide off the
turn and had no kick. TWO THIRTY FIVE bobbled at the start, vied for the lead on the inside and was roused by the quarter pole and weakened. THAT'S
MY BUSINESS was reserved early on the inside and had no response. A T M AWESOME was settled three wide and tired.

off in the final furlong to prove much the best, driving. GRAB THE GOLD prompted the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the far turn to vie for
command with the winner to his inside and then could not go with that rival while staying on to be second best. P JS SILVER DUKE was settled early,
advanced three wide on the far turn and finished willingly to best the rest. STRAWBERRY TREAT was settled back early on the inside and passed the tiring
rivals. PRATT was in tight and bumped into the first turn, then raced four wide on the far turn and had no rally. REDEEM EDDIE steadied slightly while four
wide into the first turn and then never threatened. JUST GOT STARTED was five wide into the first turn and came in sharply causing multiple rivals to be in
tight, then tracked the pace two to three wide and tired. PRINCE KHOZAN was settled on the inside and weakened. EVENT PARTY was bumped hard and
knocked sideways and rider lost iron into the first turn, then was not a faCtor. HERE'S WALDO set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. THE

Footnotes
WIN FOR LAILA tracked the early pace from the inside, advanced in hand while two wide on the turn, came three wide off the turn and split rivals by the
furlong marker and was up late to prove best under a drive. CAUSE I'M ELEGANT vied for the early lead in between rivals, then dueled for the lead on the
inside on the turn, dug in gamely in the drive but was denied late to just miss. SECRET SPELL stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid by the
quarter pole to go on even terms for command but hung late. HARD TO CATCH vied for the early lead three wide, then fell off the front nearing the quarter
pole two wide, then shifted in nearing the sixteenth marker and ran on but needed more. SASSY TALLAHASSEE was rated three wide, made a five wide
move by the quarter pole but flattened out the final furlong. JOYFUL DEPARTURE vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. CHIMING IN failed to
menace.

Footnotes
ZAMBONI WARRIOR had to check and was carried out by the loose horse on the first turn into the six path, then shifted in to be two to three wide entering
the backstretch and having the loose horse to the outside now, then advanced two wide on the far turn, came three wide off the turn and closed well to be
clear leaving the sixteenth marker and then kept MAKE ME LUCKY safe late to prove best. MAKE ME LUCKY was off a step slow, reserved early, saved
ground on the far turn, swung out six wide and closed well late. SOVEREIGN CAUSE was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the far turn and then had
a late rally but needed more while getting the show award late. PLENTY OF TIME vied for the lead three wide, made a two wide bid on the far turn to draw
clear, came three wide off the turn and then began to drift out badly and weakened late, lost show award late. NORTHWOODS was carried out very wide on
the first turn, settled three to four wide and came wide into the lane and had no rally. FAST FREEZE KAZ vied for the lead on the inside and weakened.
RUSH CENTER was fractious in the gate, stumbled at the start and lost the rider, then was caught after the race and walked off.

Footnotes
BABY FADE was away alertly to set the early pace while clear, then repelled the bid from SHATTER ME nearing the furlong marker and kicked away to
prove best under crop urging. SHATTER ME stalked the early pace on the inside, made a three wide bid off the turn but flattened out, held place award.
BLAME CATALAYA was rated along the inside early, swung out four wide leaving the turn and then had a mild late kick. RISQUE'S JEWEL was settled
back early, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally. KNOCK OUT KID was off slowly, advanced on the turn and split rivals by the five sixteenths and
came three wide off the turn but flattened. DAILY BRIEFING chased the pace on the inside and weakened. LOVE IS STRONG chased the pace four wide
and was empty. MUGURUZA chased the pace three wide and stopped.

MYGIRLSACROWNJEWEL chased the early pace and made a three wide move on the turn, then had a long drive and prevailed late to prove best. INDINI
pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid to shake clear on the turn, then had a long drive on the inside but was out-kicked late. SOL
EMPERATRIZ was settled early, made a four wide move on the turn but came up empty in the drive. BUCKFAST ABBEY showed good early speed
between rivals, chased the pace two to three wide on the turn and weakened. CASHPOINT was settled early and lacked a rally. WARRIOR BERNICE was
outrun early and failed to menace. LIFE AT BOTH ENDS set a pressured pace on the inside and stopped. HASHTAGJILLPOWER checked after the start
and then was not a factor.
