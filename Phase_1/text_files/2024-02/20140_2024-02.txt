MARLEY'S GHOST , rated back from between horses about a quarter mile after the break, stalked a three ply pace battle, advanced four deep on the turn,
secured command in upper stretch, was kept under urging through the stretch and readily pulled away. FINALJUMP , three deep disputing the pace for six
furlongs, gave way through the stretch. PRINCESS LENA , a forward factor inside horses for five furlongs, swung to the five path turning for home then
steadily retreated. REES , caught in tight quarters approaching the six furlongs pole, prompted the pace between horses to the stretch then faltered. JOB'S
NOT FINISHED disputed the pace racing along the inner rail and stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
CASINO TRICKS broke a step slow, was sent up between rivals soon after and took command, set a rated pace off the inside, met an outside challenge
from GUAPONESS leaving the far turn, dueled on near even terms to the quarter pole, shook clear near the three sixteenths, widened under a stout drive
past mid stretch then was only steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. GUAPONESS broke a bit slow, regrouped and edged up four wide outside
runners into the turn, drew alongside the winner and battled around the turn, failed to match strides in upper stretch, faded but remained clear of the rest.
HAMPDEN LANE bobbled slightly at the break, chased the dueling leaders while saving ground but lacked a serious stretch response. EVENLY DIVIDED ,
between foes pursuing the pace, gave way nearing the lane. KATIE'S NOTION had speed to briefly lead, was displaced from her inside by the winner,
prompted three wide into the turn, failed to kick on past the five sixteenths, circled four wide into the lane and weakened.

GRACEFUL ROSE tapered in early when edging up to prompt the pace, bid between foes leaving the far turn, vied under rating past the three eighths,
responded when put to firm asking in upper stretch, spurted clear a furlong out, was joined from her outside soon after, dug in tenaciously and held firm.
MAJOR HOULIHAN tracked inside, eased out for the drive, moved up to threaten past mid stretch, battled outside but was kept at bay. I CAN DO IT , a bit
rank when rated back after the break, settled off the pace and off the inside, angled mid turn, circled five wide into the lane, moved up past the eighth pole
then flattened out. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA saved ground, moved up some leaving the far turn, eased out mid turn but lacked a rally. GUN RUNNIN' GAL ,
four wide early, bid three deep leaving the far turn, vied to the five sixteenths then gave way. OH MRS. MAISEL took over early and set the pace towards
the inside, was joined by a pair of foes to her outside after a half mile, battled to the three sixteenths then gave way.

Footnotes
OUT DANCING , off a bit slow, recovered and was hustled up to the inside of rivals, continued progress to be in range leaving the far turn, eased out into
the lane, edged up behind the dueling leaders then dove inside with a furlong to go, sustained under right handed asks, took over nearing the sixteenth pole
then edged away. IRISH LACE stalked three wide, moved up to engage THUNDER BUGGY mid turn, brushed with that one when dueling past the three
sixteenths, gained a slim lead a furlong out, could not contain the winner's inside charge but kept on gamely to save the place. FANCY PRINCESS , two
wide and in range mid turn, shifted out four wide for the drive and churned on. THUNDER BUGGY vied outside a rival while holding a short lead into and
around the turn, battled to the inside of IRISH LACE from the five sixteenths, had her rider lose the whip when exchanging a brush three sixteenths out,
fought on past mid stretch then weakened late. INSTINCTIVE dropped inside while off the pace into the turn, eased out in upper stretch, split rivals with a
furlong remaining and continued willingly while towards the inner rail late. ICE CUBE BABY , urged inside a rival leaving the far turn, came out for the drive
but lacked a solid run. TWEET AWAY ROBIN , away awkwardly when tossing her head at the break, regrouped and rated off the pace, angled six wide for
the drive but failed to generate the needed response. MYSISTERNANCY lost ground four to five wide pursuing the leaders, remained in range to upper
stretch then faded. MATOULA vied inside, weakened nearing mid stretch and was eased late. BREEZY CONNECTION , three wide nearing the turn, lacked
a rally then was vanned off.

Footnotes
CAPTAIN QUINT bumped with FULL IRISH when drifting out leaving the starting gate, was patiently rated along the inner rail, swung to the four path
entering the stretch, took the lead outside horses near the sixteenth pole and drove clear. GREAT HEAVENS , jostled on both sides leaving the starting
gate, saved ground on the turn while stalking the pace, eased out to the two path at the head of the stretch, bid for the lead inside the eighth pole and
weakened late. FULL IRISH , bumped on both sides leaving the starting gate, accelerated to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the lead
inside the eighth pole and faded in the drive. BY ITS ABSENCE lacked speed, hugged the inner rail through the stretch and passed tired rivals.

Footnotes
PRINCE OF JERICHO , with the pace four wide and between rivals heading to the half, dropped in a couple paths and emerged in a duel to the inside of
KARAN'S NOTION leaving the three eighths, was nursed along holding a narrow advantage approaching the stretch, responded to firm asking past the
three sixteenths and briefly edged clear, dug in when confronted by THREES OVER DEUCES with a sixteenth to go, battled tenaciously while head to head
through the final yards and got the bob. THREES OVER DEUCES bobbled after being bumped at the break, regrouped and rated outside a rival as a duel
was going on up front, edged up between foes mid turn, waited into the lane, brushed with KARAN'S NATION when angling and squeezing through
between foes in mid stretch, ranged up to engage the winner from his outside soon after, fought valiantly but was out nodded at the wire. EXCULPATORY
disputed the early pace to the inside of four others, rated back off of the winner and KARAN'S NOTION near the three eighths, stayed inside and stalked,
steadied briefly near the quarter pole, remained towards the rail past mid stretch and churned on to earn the show. HUSHION vied two wide between
runners early, steadied back off foes leaving the far turn, recovered and angled out to make a four wide run into the lane, loomed a presence in mid stretch,
failed to sustain and faded late. HOLY SYNCHRONICITY , off the duelers while saving ground, angled three wide into the stretch but lacked a rally.
RETAINED , bumped with THREE OVER DEUCES leaving the gate, contested the early pace three wide between runners, failed to quicken with the
leading pair exiting the far turn, angled out five wide and came up empty. KARAN'S NOTION , five deep attending the pace nearing the half mile marker,
was guided inward leaving the far turn and sparred outside the winner, saw that one get away a bit leaving the three sixteenths, brushed with THREES
OVER DEUCES as that one worked for room in mid stretch then gave way.

HIS NAME IS SUE stalked the duel, circled the turn four wide, closed steadily outside horses the final furlong and was up at the wire.
CROWNEDCOUNTCRISTO disputed the pace n the two path between horses and dug in stubbornly in a sharp effort. NICK'S LITTLE BOY , three wide
prompting the pace around the turn, challenged for the lead in upper stretch and flattened out. BIG HAMBONE showed speed along the inner rail, disputed
the pace around the turn and weakened through the stretch. PRESSING CONCERN , steadied behind horses leaving the backstretch, swung to the five
path in upper stretch and failed to rally. BERNIE'S ON FIRE saved ground around the turn, chased the pace and gave way.
