Footnotes
GROUND STOP raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the three path, began a bid passing the quarter pole,
gained ground late and kicked clear. STORM CREED tracked the leaders on the outside through the early going, began a bid while saving ground around
the bend, pulled clear in upper stretch and was caught late. SHE'S THAT GIRL chased the pace setters on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn
from the two path and kept on in the lane while proving to be no match for the top two. MIA'S CAT stumbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to duel on
the outside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and weakened in the stretch. TEA'S DREAM raced off the pace on the inside early,
navigated the turn from the three path and made no bid. PRINCESS DAMIAH dueled on the inside through the opening quarter, began to drop back while
saving ground around the turn and tired further from there. MISS UNCONCERNED stumbled leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, pulled up
approaching the quarter pole and was vanned off.

around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the two path and

Footnotes
LADY AZTECA raced in the two path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the
three path, launched a bid in upper stretch and gained ground late to get the head bob for the win. GLORIOUS WAVE bumped with the horse to her inside
at the start, saved ground early, chased the leader up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the two path and dueled to the wire to just miss. TAP
AND CHU raced in the two path around the first turn, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, began a bid in upper stretch and
gained ground late to narrowly miss. LOVE RHAPSODY raced in the three path around the first bend, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack
on the inside, began a bid from the two path coming around the far bend and improved position in the stretch. WAR MUSEUM bumped with the horses to
either side at the break, saved ground early, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, swung out to the four path coming
around the far bend and improved position mildly in the lane. ENCHANTMENT (FR) raced in the two path early, led the way up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and weakened late. MILLE DREAMS (FR) bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, raced at the back of the pack in the
three path through the opening half mile, swung out to the five path coming around the turn and never threatened. SUSIE'S SAVER hit the gate leaving it,
raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the outside, swung out to the five path coming around second turn
and made no bid. PRINCESS TENKO raced at the back of the pack on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued around the far turn
in the two path and was not a factor. EMPIRE GIRL stumbled leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in
the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the two path and was empty from there.
