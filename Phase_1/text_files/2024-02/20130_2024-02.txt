Footnotes
ATTILA'S ACE was just a bit fractious in the gate, attended the pace from outside, went four wide into the turn, struck the lead outside the quarter pole,
moved clear in the stretch, held sway. JR'S CONFIDENCE was outpaced early racing outside, ridden for more coming to the quarter pole six wide, kept on
but was second best. BULL MOON settled off the pace, moved five wide on the turn to within striking distance, needed more late. SEA OF INDY raced
mid-pack chasing in behind, moved off the rail heading into the turn, swung out five wide at the top of the stretch, ran on evenly. DESERT PUNK was
bumped lightly at the start, pressed from inside, lacked the needed late kick. WF FRANKLY MY DEAR bumped the inside rival at the start, moved forward to
the lead soon after from between runners pulling against the rider's restraint, went three wide on the turn drifting five deep into upper stretch, came up
empty.

Footnotes
PARCO was mildly coaxed forward from the start, soon led to set the pace with inside pressure racing wide, went four deep on the turn, moved clear in the
stretch, held safe. I GET STORMED advanced five wide on the turn, was within range at the top of the stretch but proved no match for the winner while
second best. DOM PROUD was outpaced early bringing up the rear and kept very wide up the backstretch, angled wider still to be nine deep at the top of
the stretch, showed good late effort. TAMMY MACHO was coaxed forward from the start, pressed from inside the eventual winner but off the rail, drifted out
turning for home, weakened. FIRST TIME PLAYER switched out off the inside early chasing in behind mostly in the three to four path, failed to rally.
CHARITY WATER shifted in racing near the rail through the turn, had no late bid. ILOVEHER chased from outside just off the leaders six wide on the turn,
faded in the stretch. WHAT A MEMORY chased from near the inside, tired.

Footnotes
ROSE GIRL pressed the early pace into the turn from outside the leader, moved clear by the five-sixteenths, held sway. HEAR ME ROAR chased from
outside, moved four to five wide on the turn, lugged out in the stretch, was second best. BROADWAY DISH exchanged minor light contact at the start and
entering the turn, shifted in early on that bend saving ground, ran on evenly in the stretch. GABRIELLA WHO was outpaced early, fanned six wide into the
stretch, ran on. RAPPERS THIEF set the very early tempo pressured by the eventual winner and racing off the rail, weakened. SHELL GAME brushed
lightly with a foe at the start, steadied and was shuffled back nearing the seven-sixteenths, came out for the drive and ran on. LAS TRES MARIPOSAS
brushed with the aforementioned at the start, was in tight two wide leaving the backstretch, continued two to three deep on the turn, was not a late threat.
ATHENA'S STORM exchanged a light brush at the start, chased in behind under stout urging three to four wide on the turn angling five to six deep past the
quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. REAL ME chased mostly four to five wide, tired.

Footnotes
MONGOLIAN KINGDOM was off the early pace racing four wide on the first turn, took closer order up the backstretch then steadied when in tight past the
five-eighths, bided time in behind the leaders shifting eight wide turning for home, surged to the lead just past the sixteenth pole to prevail. BENDER settled
off the pace, switched out off the inside, moved six to seven wide on the far turn taking the lead in upper stretch, was outfinished. WHAT AN IDEA set the
pace racing off the rail, had no extra. HOLLAND settled mid-division two to three wide, switched out fanning eight deep into upper stretch and improved.
MASTERING broke a step slowly and was guided out on the first turn, made a rapid early advance six wide up the backstretch, bid three furlongs out,
lacked the needed late kick. ZIA ZAPPER was caught five wide on the first turn racing off the pace, made a swift middle move outside about seven wide up
the backstretch, flattened out. CAPITAL JOKE saved ground on the first turn then switched out and made an early move to reach just off the flanks of the
leaders, exchanged light contact dropping back nearing the seven-sixteenths, continued to weaken. OHHH DADDY pressed the pace about four wide,
began to weaken while exchanging a light brush at the seven-sixteneths and faded.

Footnotes
MR. BIG RIG moved outside drawing even with the leader at the five-sixteenths, dueled with that one, was floated seven wide leaving the turn, took
command in upper stretch and moved clear by mid-stretch, held under steady handling. TATAS JOE MARK was guided out wide in the early going, moved
back nearer the inside on the turn saving some ground, ran on in the stretch to be second best. QUANTUM BULL quickly moved clear, set the pace from off
the rail, was challenged midway on the turn, drifted six wide into upper stretch, weakened. DISCOVERY N SIGHT settled off the pace, went about four wide
on the turn and improved position. SENSE OF URGENCY switched out up the backstretch racing close into the turn, dropped back and continued to chase
from off the inside, shifted out eight wide leaving the bend, failed to rally. DAN WHO was off the pace two wide into the turn moving nearer the rail late on
that bend, ran on one-paced. COMING ABSTRACTION saved ground on the turn but was not a threat. TWO STEP JACK broke a bit awkwardly, raced wide
going five deep into the turn and fanning ten wide into upper stretch, was never near enough to threaten.

Footnotes
WHEREDOESTHECASHGO broke on top and was quickly clear to dictate terms from well off the rail, was kept to the task. DIABOLICAL RULER chased
from about two wide, between foes early, then in behind the eventual winner, was second best. COLOR ME GONE switched out early racing very wide up
the backstretch, settled in behind foes off the pace in the five to seven path for the turn, moved out nine to ten deep for the drive, ran on to get up for show
honors. HOT CHARLIE bumped a rival at the start, stalked from outside and just off the eventual winner going about five wide through the turn and in range,
lacked the needed late kick and lost show late. GOLDEN BAND chased racing about five to six wide throughout and was one-paced. BLACK EYED BANDIT
chased from outside foes six to seven wide on the turn moving out eight to nine deep for the drive, failed to rally. BOOMER WHO broke a bit awkwardly and
lacking speed, came out nine wide for the stretch run and was not a threat. TSUNAMI GOLD was bumped at the start and never a threat. AWESOME
STORM chased three wide early, faded. BISCUIT SNATCHER chased from the rail, tired.

Footnotes
TEE ROY forced the pace from outside, took over past the seven-sixteenths, drew off in the stretch. SERPICO R S S got away well and had the early lead
briefly before being overtaken by the winner, chased that one under encouragement past the three-eighths, was no match but second best. AQUIMINE
settled at the back racing about three wide through the turn, shifted in once in upper stretch, kept on to get up for show. THOUGHTS OF GOLD chased in
behind, moved out from three to six wide turning for home, kept on but missed show honors. WIND RIVER chased from outside foes five wide moving out
nine deep leaving the turn, kept on in the stretch. AUTISM WARRIOR was up close pursuing from outside four wide into the turn, moved out eight deep
turning for home, needed more late. STAFFORD TO KUPP was forwardly-positioned chasing inside, came out a bit on the turn, failed to rally. GAMBLING
COWBOY broke a step slowly, lacked early speed, moved out from five to ten wide leaving the turn, was not a threat. DINOS DA DADDY broke a half-step
slowly, went mostly four to five wide on the turn at the back and was not a threat. M G M'S LUCKY saved ground inside on the turn, was not a threat.

Footnotes
MAMA WAS A ROCKET got away well, was soon overtaken for the lead but prominent just off that rival, took over outside the five-sixteenths, moved clear
and held safe. NO REGRETS N LOVE advanced five wide on the turn, was no match for the winner, got the nod for place. CAYCEE'S MARK settled at the
back racing off the inside, fanned nine wide, gained late. CHARLIES HURRICANE chased in behind up close and off the rail, shifted seven wide at the top
of the stretch, needed more late. DELIA shifted eight wide turning for home, kicked on mildly. CASUAL ENCOUNTER saved ground inside on the turn,
came out in upper stretch and ran on. DESERTROSE OFTEXAS was two to three deep through the turn racing toward the back, failed to menace. BLUE
BLAZES WHO was forwardly-placed inside, faded. SHELLY D'ORO soon took over the lead setting the pace, faltered and faded.

OUR VALENTINO moved five wide on the turn taking the lead coming to the top of the stretch, was headed and overtaken by an outside foe while dueling
with that one, dug in late and was resurgent to just prevail. DAVE'S ENCHANTMENT came in at the start, moved six wide outside the eventual winner, bid
and took a narrow lead from that one in the stretch beginning to edge away by mid-stretch but was outfinished. OL' MCCLINTOCK was in tight racing
behind the leading group about the seven-sixteenths, gradually moved out through the turn coming seven wide to the top of the stretch, was no match for
the top pair but secured show honors. SHAME ON SAM raced off the inside and off the pace, swung nine wide into the stretch and improved. STACKERS
came out a bit at the start, vied three wide between foes, weakened. PANCHO LEFT ME was urged from the break, vied between runners, weakened.
READS PET ZENON was bothered at the start, saved ground on the turn racing at the back, came out in upper stretch, was not a threat. WRECKING
STORM attended the pace four wide, came up empty. EVERYROSEHASATHORN was strongly urged forward inside, pressed briefly, tired.
