Footnotes
NORDIC QUEEN reserved ground down the backstretch while two to three wide, then edged past inner rivals on the far turn to gain command entering the
home stretch then drew off under a strong drive to prevail in the end. ITS MY MONEY TOO pressed the pace from the two path down the backstretch, then
moved up entering the far turn to duel briefly with the pace setter, took command momentarily then was surpassed by an outer rival at the quarter pole then
kept on for the place prize in the end. CAT TALE SKY settled two to three wide behind the field in the early furlongs, then urged eagerly on the far turn to
rally in the stretch and was gaining ground but it was not enough in the end. HIGHWAY SIXTY ONE settled along the inside and was no threat. CRIMSON
LADY set the pace into the first turn from the inside, was in the clear down the backstretch, then was over taken for the lead entering the far turn and
flattened out the remainder of the course. PONDERED settled in the two path towards the back of the pack and failed to rally. SHEZA HUNK chased the
pace briefly down the backstretch from the inside then flattened out after the half and needed rally.

Footnotes
QUARTERBACK DAK was under a steady hand ride while vying for the lead with inner rivals, remained well reserved on the turn, then dug in to gain the
lead in the upper stretch and held on well to the wire. CHAMPAGNE STOOPER was nicely rated while two wide down the backstretch, then bid steadily on
the turn, came out four wide and closed willingly down the lane. WITT'S TAQUITO raced while three wide, then bid while five wide leaving the turn, and was
up for the show prize in the end. DARYLSLITTLEDIABLO was well placed between rivals while stalking the pace, then moved up to duel with an inner rival
leaving the turn and was over taken by outer rivals before giving way in the end. PICKINGUPSTRANGERS was unhurried early, then made a mild bid from
the inside on the turn and came up empty in the end. PLAY RULE was under a steady drive while vying for the lead from the inside, then dueled with an
outer foe leaving the bend and into the turn, was used up and weakened in late stretch. MR. NIGHTBLINGER trailed throughout.

rival and was met with OCELOT on the far turn, sparred gamely down the lane and just missed in the end. TAP THE DOT stalked the pace from the inside
under a steady drive, then bid on the far turn to menace in the home stretch and was gaining ground but it was not enough in the end. SWORD ZORRO
(IRE) raced in the middle of the field from the inside and into the far turn, then rallied in the early stretch and came up evenly in the stretch. RELEASE
