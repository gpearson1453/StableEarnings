moved up two deep between rivals in the stretch and finished gamely to the wire. JUBA BOUND void of early speed, swung five wide and flattened with final

Footnotes
TEMPESTIVO was a step slow at the start then quickly advanced to be in contention, navigated three wide around the first turn and stalked the top pair to
the far turn, made a move near the quarter pole, matched strides briefly, then took over the lead entering the top of the stretch and finished going away.
XCELLENT START was allowed to settle out of the gate and rated off the top trio through early stages, picked up the pace two to three wide leaving the far
turn, sustained a steady bid through the stretch run and captured place. JAZZ WITH DENIS was forwardly placed from the onset and pressed the pace up
the backstretch, made a move in tandem with TEMPESTIVO near the quarter pole, briefly matched strides then failed to move forward and evened out in
the lane. COLT ROCK sped to the lead at the start and set the pace up the backstretch, got collared by a duo midway through the far turn and gave way.
TIMMY tracked the pace while saving ground along the inside, cut the corner turning for home and lacked the needed punch for impact. FEARNOUGHT
was reserved near the inside and failed to move into a threatening position. HIALEAH NATIVE raced in range through middle stages then began to falter
late on the far turn.
