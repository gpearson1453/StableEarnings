Footnotes
RUN DREAMING dueled for the lead along with an outer rival and drew clear in upper stretch. MIA ANTONIA laid off of the pace in the four to five path,
then rallied to gain place at the wire. TALKABOUT stalked three wide, chased hanging on her left lead through upper stretch, improved to reach place
entering the final sixteenth but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. HEY YOU pursued from the three path and ran on mildly. SPARKLE CITY took
contact from an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch and gave way. WAKE UP
DOLORES chased along the inside and gave way. DREAMED I AM FAST was outrun. PRINCESS MOCCASINS broke inwardly and bumped a rival at the
start, then lacked speed along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
SCOOTERANDDABIGMAN broke inwardly, showed the way via a clear margin, widened his margin under driving pressure in upper stretch and was put to
hand with a sixteenth to go. UNCLE NICK chased from the three path, ran on to gain place form an outer rival at the furlong grounds and was second best.
LORD DYLAN leaned outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped out passing the quarter pole, ran on willingly to gain show at the
sixteenth pole and held from an outer bidder. REVERENT bounced off an inner rival into an outer foe while getting pinched between horses at the start,
trailed in the two path, swung out to the six path entering the lane and stayed on to miss reaching show. CARLOS PUNCH stalked outside of the leader as
that one's closest pursuer, was urged in to sustain position in the three path around the turn, but drifted to the four path entering upper stretch and gave way
on his left lead. LET'S GO RANDOM popped open the gate pre-race but was restrained from leaving it, then chased from midpack along the inside and
faded. ROLL ON OUT laid off of the pace in the three path and between horses, and failed to factor. CREME DE BALI broke outwardly and bumped a rival
at the start, raced off of the pace four wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
BOURBON DAY laid off of the pace in the three to four path, ranged up in the five path entering the lane bid while travelling well in upper stretch, led coming
under a drive at the furlong grounds, inched clear soon after and held sway. HIGH TIDE laid off of the pace in the two path, took closer order between
horses coming to the half mile pole, awaited racing room behind the leaders around the far turn, remained blocked in upper stretch, shifted out four wide
passing the furlong grounds, ran on to vie for place along with an inner rival and prevailed. FIREWATER JAKE tracked along the inside, moved closer
nearing the half mile pole, but was shuffled back behind the fading early pace-setter nearing the lane, blocked and steadied hard behind rivals in upper
stretch, altered outer, re-rallied between horses passing the furlong pole, vied for place with an outer rival late but missed. SOUL COAXING steadied back
to a tracking position into the first turn, pursued from the three path before pressing outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid in the four path along with
an outer rival in upper stretch, vied before getting outkicked at the furlong grounds, then yielded between horses. SEVEN CHANNELS trailed along the
inside, shifted out around the far turn, entered the lane in the four path and chased willingly. GROUP EIGHTEEN prompted two wide, led narrowly around
the far turn, drifted to the three path entering the lane but weakened to outer rivals in midstretch. AWE SHACKLE set the pace along the inside, prompted
while headed into the far turn, but faded nearing the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CRYSTAL D'ORO tracked along the inside under a snug hold around the first turn, pursued comfortably around the far turn before tipping outside of the
leading trio entering the lane, rallied to bid at the furlong grounds and kicked clear entering the final sixteenth. SHES A LUCKY REBEL set the pace along
the inside, led from an outer pair of prompters around the far turn, shook free of them in upper stretch before being confronted by an outer bidder at the
furlong grounds, then proved no match for that one with a sixteenth to go. DREWSILLA moved forward to a three wide stalking position around the first turn,
pressed three deep around the far turn, but gave way while getting outkicked by an outer rival in upper stetch. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE pressed two wide,
prompted between horses around the far turn but faded in upper stretch. ANITA'S VISION laid off of the pace in the five path, inched closer in the four path
around the far turn before being floated back to the five path entering the lane, and emptied out. GUITAR WOMAN pursued from the four path and made
little impact. SHELLI'S ANGEL fidgeted just before the gates sprung, then broke in the air while spotting the rest multiple lengths, and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DIXIE FARMER stalked along the inside, ranged up outside of the leading pair turning for home to bid entering the lane, kicked clear in upper stretch, held
sway before meeting a late challenge and just lasted. CZAR'S BALLERINA settled off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the five path entering the lane,
progressed before shifting inwardly in midstretch, straightened and sustained her rally to quickly close in on the clear leader approaching the wire, but
narrowly came up short. OLIVIA G broke a bit awkwardly, pursued from midpack in the three path, chased in the four path and between horses in upper
stretch, got herded inwardly and into a rival's path in midstretch, ran on to gain show soon after and held. STARSNMOTION steadied out of crowded
quarters among foes early on, trailed in the four path, moved out of last before taking the far turn in the six path , then stayed on willingly. LEAD ME settled
off of the pace along the inside, moved two wide and between horses entering the lane, but steadied when blocked behind rivals entering the final furlong,
altered out and kept on. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with that one around the far turn, got swiftly outkicked by an
outer bidder in upper stretch and faded. SIKARA SIKARA bobbled at the start, lacked speed along the inside, then in the five path around the far turn and
failed to menace. DAISY DE ORO prompted two wide, vied into and around the far turn, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. CALAJA lacked
speed along the inside, but was done early then surpassed tired rivals. SMART IZZY pursued along the inside and weakened. EXACTA lunged inwardly at
the start, tracked three wide, but weakened in the four path into the far turn.

Footnotes
GLEN AIRY was bumped between horses at the start, settled off of the pace in the three path, saved ground around the far turn before gaining behind the
leaders entering the lane, steadied lacking rail seam in upper stretch before being able to slip through passing the furlong grounds, and edged ahead in the
final sixteenth. MIDNIGHT RAID tracked two to three wide, ranged up in the four path around the far turn to bid in upper stretch, vied through midstretch but
was outkicked by an inner rival in the late stages. LAUGHINALLTHEWAY stalked two wide, pursued in the three path as an outer rival ranged alongside
around the far turn, bid along with that one in upper stretch, vied among foes through midstretch but was outkicked on either side late. SINGLE RULER
bumped with an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, picked up stride two wide around the far turn, fanned out to the five path in upper stretch and
ran on willingly. HAROLD'S CLOUD set a clear pace, met challenges on either side in upper stretch, then yielded in tight quarters among foes in the final
furlong. KOLOMIO bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside, attempted to press in the two path along with outer rivals around the far
turn, but lacked a bid before steadying out of tight quarters between horses entering midstretch. FLAWLESS RULER laid off of the pace along the inside
and was done early.

Footnotes
ROCK'N A HALO bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride swinging to the five path and outside of rivals
in midstretch, rallied to reel in the leader in the closing stages and forged a narrow advantage at the wire. HERO WORSHIP bobbled and bumped with an
outer rival at the start, tracked in the three path, rallied entering the lane in the four path, bid entering midstretch while flopping to and from his left lead, led
leaving the furlong grounds but was nailed by an outer bidder at the wire. BONZER nudged the inner part of the gate upon leaving it, dueled for the lead with
an outer rival, got outkicked by a wider bidder at the furlong grounds, yielded and lasted for show. RADICAL MISCHIEF broke awkwardly, raced at the rear
in the four path, then rallied well to miss reaching show whlie dead-heating for fourth at the wire. AIR FORCE CRUISING dueled for the lead two wide, was
outkicked by an outer bidder in midstretch, gave way and dead heated for fourth. REDEPOSIT prompted along the inside before stalking after a furlong,
pursued from the two to three path around the bend, then gave way hanging on his left lead. CARTHAGE CAJUN lacked speed in the three path and failed
to factor. TAKETHEFIFTH leaned in and bumped a rival at the start before reacted greenly in the aftermath, then saved ground well back but to no avail.
GORDITO HERMOSO was bumped by an outer rival at the start, chased from midpack along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
SONOFASHIP bumped with an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, smoothly split the top pair two wide at the quarter pole, sparked a duel with
his inner counterpart in upper stretch, edged past in midstretch and held sway. CARPIS set the pace along the inside, met an outer challenge leaving the
quarter pole, sparred gamely while getting headed in midstretch and fought on grudgingly. TAKE CHARGE J J chased forwardly in the three path and
between horses, remained under consistent urging around the turn, yet kept on well to inch closer to the top pair in the final furlong. LIVE AFFAIR broke
slowly, trailed along the inside, tipped to to the two path turning for home, then moved up between foes in the final furlong. GUTZY pursued from midpack in
the four to five path, then gave way. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE broke a bit outwardly, stalked three wide before moving to press the leader into the turn,
sustained pressure turning for home but gave way while drifting to the four path in upper stretch and weakened between horses. GOT ME A CHRYSLER
bumped an inner rival and steadied back at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
MOMENT OF STARDOM tracked along the inside, bid inside of the leader in midstretch, inched clear entering the final sixteenth, shifted outwardly and was
put to hand late. HUDSON'S TURN settled well back along the inside, then just off of the fence around the far turn, closed in behind rivals in upper stretch,
was blocked while searching for racing room behind traffic entering the final furlong, tipped in and ran on to gain place late. DEER CROSSING laid off of the
pace in the two path, split foes after shifting to the five path in midstretch and gained show while missing place at the wire. COFFEE COUNTY vied two wide
before leading and crossing over entering the backstretch, built a clear margin turning for home, vacated the inside nearing the final three sixteenths, but
was bested by bidders on either side leaving the furlong grounds. UNIFIED REPORT vied along the inside before switching out to stalk two wide entering
the backstretch, offered pressure before chasing the clearing leader from between horses turning for home, sustained pursuit in the three path and among
foes while vying for minor placings into deep stretch, but was outfinished late. MONARCH'S MISCHIEF stalked in the three path, then between horses
turning for home, chased in the four path in upper stretch, vied for minor placings among foes through the final furlong but was outfinished late. PERRINS
pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, steadied slightly entering the backstretch, shfited out four wide soon after, but faded between horses
entering the far turn. SMARTY ALEX trailed in the four to five path, advanced outside of rivals into and around the far turn, but drifted to the six path entering
upper stretch, delayed changing leads until midstretch and weakened.

Footnotes
NERVY prompted two wide before gaining an advantage into the turn, led before drawing off turning for home, widened under a drive in upper stretch and
was geared down late. ONE MORE SLEEP laid off of the pace in the three to four path, then ran on while hanging on his left lead to gain place nearing the
wire. MEASURE OF FAITH tracked in the two to three path, gained place as an outer rival bid for that position entering the final sixteenth and was bested
late. LT. TENT lacked speed along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch and moved up. FLASH N CLASS set the pace inside of the eventual winner, got
headed by that one into the turn and gave way turning for home. COMPUTERIZED lacked speed in the two path into the turn and failed to factor. POETIC
ROAD made little impact from the four path. ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL chased along the inside and faded. IRON FORTUNE was away awkwardly and
slow, trailed in the five to seven path and was outrun.
