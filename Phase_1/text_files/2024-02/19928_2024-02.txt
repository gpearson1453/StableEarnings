tracked the early pace, raced five wide through the turn, angled in mid stretch, was no match late and finished second best. MARQUEE'S STORM was
rushed early to be in a settled position along the inside, angled out though the turn, was empty late and held for third. POW WOW broke out at the start, was
void of any early speed, raced between rivals and offered no late rally. LAKE ETHEL was unhurried early, raced seven wide and never fired. REBEL
RYETTE was outrun early, raced between rivals, was no factor and was vanned off. ROCKETT'S RED CITY chased the early pace from off the rail and
faded.
