LUCKY COMBINATION saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the two path
and kicked clear in the lane. RISK METRIC raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the
second turn from the three path and improved position in the lane. WARWOMAN raced in the two path early, dueled on the inside up the backstretch,
continued to battle while saving ground around the far bend and could not go with the winner in the stretch but chased that rival home from there. RAPID
MISS TAPIT raced off the pace on the inside through the opening half mile, continued to save ground around the second bend and made up some ground
in the stretch but never threatened. BLUE TOPAZ bumped with the horse to his outside and checked leaving the gate, raced in the two path early, dueled on
the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and faded in the lane. TEDDY BALABAN raced in the four path around the four path
around the first bend, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, continued around the second bend in the two path and made no bid.
ROULA'S REVENGE bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader between horses up the
backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the second turn and continued to tire from there.
