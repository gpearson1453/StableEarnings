Footnotes
RHYTHEM ON STAGE settled off the pace then moved into range leaving the backstretch, raced along the rail then two wide on the turn, angled out into
the lane, rallied widest and overhauled inner rivals. GHOSTLY ACT stalked outside a rival, coaxed along on the turn, bid four deep in upper stretch, drifted
in to brush inner rival, put a head in front at the sixteenth pole, drifted in again late and was overtaken by the winner. FORTY NINER GOLD cleared early
and steered inward then dueled with outer rival up the backstretch, battled along the rail through the turn, resisted to the sixteenth pole and faltered late.
BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK pulled early chasing behind the top pair, saved ground through the turn, tipped out into the stretch, bid between rivals, got brushed
by GHOSTLY ACT midstretch, continued to fight on between foes then got put in tight by that rival late and lost the show. SNEAK A SMILE chased briefly
then went up to duel from outside, fought two wide through the turn, battled between foes into the final sixteenth and got bothered by outer rivals late. DARK
MARCUS trailed off the fence then moved inside, passed a rival early on the bend, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a rally. EVERTORIANO chased
from off the pace early, trailed around the turn, moved out and came four wide into the lane and had little left for the drive. THE STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED
GHOSTLY ACT FROM SECOND TO FOURTH FOR SHIFTING IN AND CAUSING INTERFERENCE TO BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK LATE, COSTING THAT
RIVAL A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.

Footnotes
COURT SNORT stalked in the three path under a hold early, bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run, fought outside SAND TO SEA into deep stretch
and edged the runner-up. SAND TO SEA sped clear in the two path, felt a bit of pressure midway up the backstretch then cleared again nearing the far turn,
coaxed along at the quarter pole on the fence, asked left handed at the eighth pole still clear but with COURT SNORT looming to the outside, held a short
lead over that rival into the final sixteenth and yielded late. SWEET HELLO raced up close three wide around the clubhouse turn, applied pressure from
outside approaching the half-mile pole, chased the leader two wide into and around the far turn and flattened in the stretch run. SATOSHI stalked along the
fence through both turns and faded down the lane. TIZZY TWISTER trailed a bit off the rail on both turns and was never a factor. PER HIWU RULING
#ECM2024-82, SAND TO SEA WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
TEEN DRAMA dueled for the lead from outside to the top of the lane, shook free in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire. PALEO'S PRINCESS
chased inside a rival along the rail, tipped out into the lane, bumped outer rival in upper stretch and finished willingly for second. NEW COLLECTION (GB)
stalked outside a rival, got bumped by inner foe in upper stretch, failed to produce a bid but kept on for the show honors. AWESOME TAYLOR broke a step
slow, trailed on the inside early, made progress while easing off the rail around the bend, drifted to the inside in the lane and could not summon the needed
rally. STRESSED dueled for the lead from inside, failed to kick on with the winner in upper stretch and gave way. DULCE EMMA hit the gate to break a bit
slow, traveled outside a rival at the back early, dropped back two wide on the turn, eased in the lane, bled following the race and walked into the van.

PACIFIC ROSE vied inside a pair of rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, took a short lead when asked right handed midstretch and dug in to hold
over outer rivals. PETITE ANGE became rank for a bit and brushed with inner rival early, chased along the rail into the turn, ridden along while steering off
the fence on the turn, spun three wide into the lane, moved out further and bid four deep with a furlong remaining and edged rival for second. PACE LANE
stalked two wide into the turn, chased between on the turn then came four wide into the lane, moved out further and bid five deep and got edged for second.
CRITICISM chased between rivals for a bit before behind put in tight and pinched back at the five-eighths pole, trailed five wide into the turn, moved down to
the three path around the bend, angled out in upper stretch and summoned a mild rally. AVOIR fought outside a pair of rivals for command up the
backstretch and around the turn, carried a narrow lead three wide into the lane, resisted into the final furlong, then relinquished the lead midstretch and
flattened late. ANG N ASH made light contact with outer rival early then went up to vie between rivals to the stretch, fought back into the final furlong but
weakened in deep stretch. QUEEN GIRVIN stalked four wide into the turn, came five wide into the drive and weakened.

Footnotes
TOPOLINA hopped then stumbled at the start, moved into range between rivals up the backstretch, continued between foes in the two path on the turn,
tipped out into the stretch, finished well but was outkicked for second. YOLO CALLS broke in and flashed early speed before ceding command to ICE
QUEEN, was closest in pursuit along the rail then shifted two wide late on the bend, overtook the leader at the eighth pole, drove clear midstretch and held
well. DENDERA settled inside, saved ground through the turn, moved off the fence in the lane and closed well to get up for second. ICE QUEEN sped clear
and angled over to the inside, remained unchallenged through the turn, failed to offer any resistance to YOLO CALLS in upper stretch and weakened late to
lose the place and show. GOLDEN PRAYER stalked three deep to the stretch, got floated out a bit at the top of the lane, lacked the needed response when
asked and was not persevered with in the final sixteenth. INNER BEAUTY (IRE) stumbled leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch, rounded the bend
three then two wide, altered out a bit in deep stretch and needed to find more late.

ASPIRATIONAL dropped back early, advanced along the inside through the turn, closed in steadily from the fence, collared YO YO MAMA at the sixteenth
pole and drove clear approaching the wire. YO YO MAMA brushed the gate but still came away well, stepped to the front outside rivals then cleared up the
backstretch, angled in entering the turn, showed the way along the inside into the stretch, roused at the top of the lane and put to right handed urging,
remained clear to midstretch, then got tested at the sixteenth pole and yielded late. GUNGAGUNGAGALUNGA forwardly placed three deep into the turn,
closest in aim two wide entering the drive but flattened out in the furlong grounds. RAUCOUS TIZZY bumped with outer rival and bobbled at the start,
dropped back early, trailed two wide around the bend, moved out further in the drive and missed the show honors. ONE SMOKIN MOON forwardly placed
early then chased out of range three wide into the turn, moved out to the four path around the bend, got carried out entering the stretch and lacked a rally.
HALF NELSON bumped with inner rival at the start, chased inside rivals, got crowded by outer rival early on the turn, angled off the fence then got carried
wide leaving the bend and weakened. NO CAN QUIT closest in pursuit up the backstretch, lost ground two wide on the turn, drifted into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT FURY vied three deep into the first turn then chased in the three path around the bend, raced outside a rival still far off the pace into the far turn,
closest in pursuit three wide into the lane, reeled in the leader at the sixteenth pole and drove past. MONTANA settled two wide then along the rail, saved
ground through the far turn, looked to start a rally but had to wait behind a rival exiting the far turn, gained a clear path and was turned loose, closed fast
from the fence through the final furlong but ran out of time. ELECTOR hustled to the front from inside, cleared on the clubhouse turn and began to open up
around the bend, continued to widen to a sizeable advantage in the middle stages, continued well clear through the far turn, started to grow a bit weary
entering the furlong grounds, clung to a short advantage with a sixteenth remaining and yielded late. TIZ TOK traveled three wide near the back, moved out
on the far turn and came six wide into the lane, summoned a mild rally but could not get by ELECTOR for third. SEATTLE BREAKOUT chased in the four
path before dropping far behind the leader, rounded the far turn two then three wide and whittled the gap late. NEVER SEEN BEFORE (IRE) trailed three
then two wide on the first turn, moved to the rail on the backstretch, angled out and came five wide into the stretch and could not rally. ARREST chased five
wide early, remained wide up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane and weakened. PLAY CHICKEN vied between into the first turn then chased the
leader around the bend, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch then raced inside a rival into the far turn, saved ground to the stretch and came up empty.

Footnotes
PRANCINGTHRUPARIS showed early speed between rivals then chased the top trio up the backstretch, rounded the bend in the two path, came out and
brushed rival in upper stretch, took over past the eighth pole and held gamely. SAFA bobbled slightly at the start, sat off the pace, got boxed in between
rivals on the turn, losing positions in the process, angled out in upper stretch, closed well and gained second. QUICK KATE traveled near the back three
deep, gained through the turn, brushed with inner rival in upper stretch, finished well but got outkicked by the top pair. SHAMROCKIN chased outside a rival
at the back, angled out on the turn, raced four wide turning for home and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. RECALCITRANT vied inside a
pair of rivals, carried a narrow lead over outer pair through the turn, resisted to the eighth pole, then lost command shortly after and weakened in deep
stretch. BACK ON TRACK antsy in the gate, tracked on the inside to the stretch, moved out a bit then altered back inside in upper stretch and flattened out.
SATELLITE HEART lifted her head to break slow and came in at the start, race at the back along the inside, checked inside a rival into the turn, swung out
into the lane and failed to menace. THE SHUSHALA vied between rivals up the backstretch and around the turn, fought to the eighth pole and gave way.
SOMEONE LIKE YOU raced in range off the rail, came three wide into the stretch and faded. CLUBHOUSE BRIDE vied four then three deep on the
backstretch, battled inner pair around the bend, lugged out in upper stretch and was eased, then walked off following the race.
