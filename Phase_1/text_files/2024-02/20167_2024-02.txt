Footnotes
PAT HAND GIRL saved ground towards the rear, launched a rally in upper stretch, shifted off the inside passing the furlong grounds, sustained progress to
bid outside of the leader in the closings stages and was up in time. MO BLING stalked outside of the leader and from the three to two path, bid around the
far turn before gaining an advantage at the five sixteenths pole, inched clear in upper stretch, held sway into the final sixteenth but was collared late and got
nailed at the wire. MACEE set a clear pace early on, met an outer challenge around the far turn, got headed by that bidder at the five sixteenths pole, kept
on in pursuit through the final furlong and held show. REALITOS tracked the to pair from the two to three path, lacked a bid before getting outkicked for
show by an inner rival passing the furlong grounds and held fourth. AVERI EVER AFTER laid off of the pace three wide, took the far turn in the four to five
path, ran on willingly while flopping back to his left lead at the sixteenth pole and needed more for a minor share. ANN'S STORM saved ground off of the
pace, but tipped to the two path entering the lane and yielded between horses. A WISH FOR MADELYN pursued from midpack along the inside, moved out
to the three path entering the backstretch, chased around the far turn then lacked a rally between horses. ASHLEY'S GIRL chased from midpack two wide,
got floated to the four path entering the backstretch and steadily faded.

Footnotes
C C SENORA settled off of the pace in the two path, shifted out to the seven path in midstretch and offered a good late kick to sweep past the leading pair
approaching the wire. MOION stalked four wide, took the turn in the five path, bid in upper stretch sparking a duel with the pace setter, exchanged contact
with that one at the furlong grounds, sparred thereafter but was outkicked by an outer bidder late. HALF OFF HALF set a pressured pace while a bit off of
the inside around the turn, drifted out in upper stretch to duel with an outer bidder, exchanged contact with that one at the furlong grounds, continued the
battle through the late stages but was outkicked by a wider bidder in the final sixteenth. STEPHANIE'S MARIA was bumped by an inner rival at the start,
settled off of the pace in the two path then ran on between horses entering the final furlong. JET ROCKET pressed three wide and between horses while in
the four path around the turn, but yielded between the top pair in upper stretch. D'BUSKER chased the main group briefly, but greenly faltered before
lugging out at the half mile, recovered to saved ground well back around the turn, then moved up. GET GUSSIED UP was bumped by an outer rival at the
start, prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but yielded when in subtly tight quarters among foes at the five sixteenths pole and weakened
through the lane. CHAPELLETE broke out and bumped a rival at the start before steadying back in the aftermath, then lacked speed in the four path and
made little impact. UNKNOWN CALLER leaned into an inner rival at the start, tracked along the inside and weakened hanging on her left lead. AUNT
ADDIE broke slowly, trailed in the three path and was outrun.

Footnotes
CHARLIE T dueled for the lead along the inside, disposed of his outer counterpart entering the lane, met an outer challenge in upper stretch yet repelled
that bidder at the furlong grounds and held sway. RUE LALA stalked the embattled leading pair from the two to three path, drifted to the four path entering
the lane, ranged up to offer a bid in upper stretch but was turned away at the furlong grounds, then kept on well to be second best. FREE DROP MADDY
saved ground pursuing in midpack, then edged show from outer rivals in midstretch. BASALT STREET pursued from midpack in the four path, tucked to the
two path entering the lane, chased shifting out from the three path to the four path in upper stretch, but was outkicked for show by an inner rival at the
furlong grounds. KYLE BEAUTY trailed along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane, moved wider in upper stretch and moved up in the final
furlong. LAKE MARIE chased from the three path, but drifted to the four to five path around the turn and gave way entering the lane. EVE'S DELIGHT saved
ground off of the pace but to no avail. SUMITUP dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner, yielded to that one entering the lane and faded between
horses. MICHELLES LIL STAR lacked speed two wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
BIG FIG bumped with an inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside, decisively bid up a vacated rail to vie inside of the pace setter entering the turn,
sparred with that one into upper stretch, edged clear at the furlong grounds and was put to hand with a sixteenth to go. GARNET JUBILEE showed the way
in the two to three path approaching the turn, vied with an inner bidder around the bend, dueled with that one in upper stretch, yielded, entering midstretch
and held place. MIDNIGHT AVENGER stalked three wide and between horses, chased the top pair around the turn, but failed to keep pace with them
turning for home, then held show through the lane. TAYSOM was off slowly, raced at the rear four wide, launched a gain into the turn, progressed fanning
from the three to five path nearing the lane, but leveled off. GREY'S RUMOR saved ground off of the pace, shifted out in upper stretch and failed to menace.
WHATDIDWEDO bumped the inner stall door upon breaking slow, laid off of the pace three wide and failed to factor. PAPA FLEW BOMBERS broke
outwardly, raced at the rear along the inside, moved out to the four path entering the turn and made little impact. CHASING CHAYSE tracked along the
inside, chased turning for home and faded on his left lead. PURPLE OCTOPUS chased four wide and weakened entering the lane. ENGLISH BOBBY
bumped with an outer rival at the start, lacked speed two wide and between horses and tired.

Footnotes
MISTER MMMMM prompted outside of the leader, vied two wide around the turn and drove clear in midstretch. AMBIVALENT laid off of the pace three wide
and between horses, tipped to the six path entering upper stretch, rallied to bid for place passing the sixteenth pole and narrowly gained that position at the
wire. PLANE TALK vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, got headed by that foe in upper stretch, met an outer challenge for place at the sixteenth
pole and lost that position at the wire. CHISELER pursued from midpack along the inside, steadied very subtly before pursing behind traffic around the turn,
then ran on mildly inside of rivals through the final furlong. DETROIT CITY stalked along the inside, chased in the two path in upper stretch and yielded
between horses. GILDED RULER pursued from midpack two wide, turned for home between horses, shifted three wide in upper stretch and ran on evenly.
DOWAGIAC CHIEF laid off of the pace four wide, floated to the seven path in midstretch and moved up. B D VALESKI laid off of the pace along the inside,
slipped inside of a troubled foe into the turn, shifted out six wide in midstretch but failed to menace between horses. DECCAN PRINCE (IRE) tracked four
wide, advanced to press the top pair passing the three furlong pole, but drifted to the five path entering upper stretch and faded. GUNNER BAY raced off of
the pace two wide and between horses, but tugged while hard to handle leaving the nine sixteenths pole, steadied repeatedly thereafter culminating in
checking hard and faltering to last entering the turn, and was outrun from there. ON YOUR MARK stalked three to two wide and between horses into the
turn, shifted three to four path in upper stretch but lacked a bid and weakened through the final furlong.

SWEET CHARLIZE broke a step slow, moved three wide and between horses while off of the pace around the turn, rallied tipping five wide into the lane, bid
in upper stretch and drove clear at the furlong grounds. MIZ MASTERY rushed forward after a flat-footed beginning to duel for the lead along with an outer
rival, shook free of that one entering the lane, but met a wider challenge soon after, proved no match for that one entering the final furlong and clung to
place from an outer bidder through the closing stages. NEW WOMAN bumped with an outer rival at the start, advanced between foes to track three wide
into the turn, took aim in the four path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, kept on to bid for place at the sixteenth pole but
was denied. HATTIE BLOOM saved ground tracking the pace, idled nearing the lane before slipping through inside of a rival entering the lane, then only
managed to offer a rail chase. MORNING MIRACLE broke outwardly after being off slow, lacked speed in the three path and moved up. MOR MOR MUSIC
chased four wide and between horses, weakened at the three furlong pole, yet surpassed tired rivals in the lane. CHURCH PEW broke a step slow and
bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged behind early on, shfited out after cutting the gap entering the lane, improved but failed to factor.
CATCHYALATER bumped with an inner rival at the start, pursued from midpack five to four wide, but weakened floated back to the five path entering the
lane. PROBLEMATICA bumped with an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead two wide, but yielded entering the lane in the three path and weakened
between horses. A LIL PSYCHOTIC chased in the two path, weakened between horses entering the lane and steadied among foes inside the three
sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
EVAN HARLAN stalked two wide, bid outside of the leader in midstretch, drove clear and lasted from an outer belated bidder. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD
tracked along the inside encountered traffic in the two path in upper stretch, altered course to the five path in midstretch, rallied to close in on the clear
leader approaching the wire but came up short. BATTLE SCARS settled off of the pace two wide, pursued between horses around the far turn, shifted out to
the six path in upper stretch and rallied belatedly to reach show late. PIKE PLACE stalked along the inside under snug restraint around the first turn,
checked to alter outside of a faltering foe at the three furlong pole, pursued between horses turning for home, ran on among foes to bid for place at the
sixteenth pole but was outkicked by an outer pair in the final sixteenth. QUATERNION saved ground off of the pace, shifted three wide in midstretch,
encountered traffic in the final sixteenth tipped out and ran on among foes late. CAROOM pursued from midpack three wide, entered the lane in the five
path, chased shifting down to the four path in upper stretch and lacked a bid. COACHES MEETING set the pace inside of a vying rival, faltered into the far
turn, yet recovered turning for home and kept on mildly thereafter. BROWN LIQUOR MAN brushed an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide, vied down
the backstretch, cleared his faltering counterpart at the three furlong pole, but was caught by the eventual winner at the furlong grounds and weakened.
HARD RYE GUY broke slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, shfited out in upper stretch and failed to menace. DAPPER DUDE broke a step slow and
bumped with an inner rival at the start, then lacked speed three wide and made little impact. MAASAI WARRIOR broke a step slow and bumped with an
outer rival while getting grazed by an inner foe, raced well back four wide, entered the lane in the six path and was outrun.

Footnotes
NERVY stalked three wide, bid entering the lane and kicked clear. VERO CAMPIONE was pinched between horses at the start, lacked speed in the three
path, fanned out to the seven path in upper stretch and rallied to reach place at the wire. CHECK ME OUT tracked four wide, chased the clearing leader to
gain place at the furlong grounds, but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. COLT'S BRIM laid off of the pace in the two to three path and ran on
willingly. LIL WOADIE reared when the gates spring, broke erratically and spotted the leader many lengths at the start, trailed in the four path around the
turn, then moved up in the six path. HAWAIIAN ARGUMENT laid off of the pace remaining in the five path and failed to menace. PITCH AND RUN broke
through the gate pre-race, reloaded after passing a veterinarian's exam, then broke out and bumped and hindered a pair of foes at the start, lacked speed in
the two path and made little impact. MECKES PRIORITY chased from midpack along the inside, checked behind a foe entering the lane then failed to
threaten between horses. HANDSOME HAROLD dueled for the lead two wide but weakened between horses in upper stretch. CALIBRACHOAMATTERS
stumbled and was bumped by an inner rival at the start, dueled for the lead with an outer foe around the turn, yielded to wider rivals in upper stretch and
caved in the final furlong. JOSEPH H pursued from midpack two wide and faded.
