Footnotes
CURRENT SITUATION prompted the pace in the three path, was roused into the far turn, tipped out to the four path at the top of the lane, and drew past
the inner pacesetter around the sixteenth. A RING THING showed the way along the inside around the first turn to set the pace in the two path down the
backstretch, got put under ride entering the far turn, dug in from the two path in upper stretch, but was caught by an outer foe around the sixteenth to place.
NANA FANNY tracked in the two path, was ridden along inside of rivals into the far turn, bumped an outer foe while angling out to the five path at the top of
the stretch, and kept on for show. KHOSEA was held up around the first turn to lay off the pace in the three path down the backside, received a right handed
cue approaching the quarter, but finished evenly along the inside down the lane. RUNAWAY BREEZE stalked in the four path, was driven around the far
turn, got bumped out to the six path by an inner foe at the top of the stretch, and faded. TEMPEREYA rated in the five path but never threatened. RADIANT
GEM trailed throughout from the two to three paths.

Footnotes
DEFINITE DIVA set the pace in the two path and kicked clear while ridden out. UNCAPTURED DOVE saved ground off the pace, rallied along the rail and
was just up for the place. STREET CHARITY was bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide, angled four wide in upper stretch, rallied outside and just
missed second. OLYMPIC ARTIST raced off the pace two wide, kept on between rivals in the lane and just missed second. CALL ME PENNY pressed the
winner in the three path, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. APPLAUSE raced in range four wide and lacked the needed rally. QUEEN
VALENTINA was bumped at the start, steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened.

PAYNTED BLUE set the pace in the two path, was cued passing the quarter, floated out to the four path at the top of the lane, and kicked away. MACLIN
stalked in the three path, but lost ground and came under right handed encouragement in the two path midway around the turn, angled out to the six path
entering the stretch, and kept on to get up for place. BERNARDO'S LEGACY prompted the pace in the four path but finished evenly in the five path down
the lane for show. LAST SHIFT broke slowly and trailed in the three path early, was cued from the rail midway around the turn, but failed to bid on his left
lead in the stretch. BLUE SOLDIER tracked in the five path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the lane, but failed to menace.

Footnotes
PLATINUM ROCKER bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace inside, was coaxed into the far turn, lost the lead turning into the lane, but dug in
gamely along the inside, and fought back to get up in the closing stages. HOUSE OF MELODY laid up close outside the pacesetter in the two path turning
into the backstretch, bid in the three path around the far turn, ran on to lead in the two path at the top of the stretch, but hung and was caught by the game
inner pacesetter to place. SIZZLE raced in midpack along the inside, was cued passing the quarter, shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane, and
kept on between foes to get up for show. TAKE YOUR POINT chased in the two path, was driven in the three path around the far turn, swung out to the six
path at the top of the stretch, and stayed on. VILLI OLENTO tracked in the two path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, but finished evenly in the three
path down the lane. MY LITTLE SECRET stalked inside but was one paced from the two path in the stretch. BUTTERFLY QUEEN laid off the pace in the
two path, fanned out to the eight path under a drive turning into the stretch, but made no impact. LADY MONIQUE rated along the inside but failed to bid.
ALLOVERNOW BABYBLU raced wellback in the two path early and never menaced. MISS MUTZ bumped with an inner foe at the start, trailed around the
first turn, pulled up entering the backstretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
STARSHIP MOCHA pressed in the pace in the three path, took over near the three-eighths marker and drew off while being ridden out. TIZ MARKS SPIRIT
raced four wide in midpack, was no match for the winner, kept on and was clearly second best in the lane. EXCLUSIVE DANCER saved ground off the
pace, angled four wide turning for home and was along for the show. AIR FORCE ROYALTY failed to menace while racing five wide. BREEZE THE BAYOU
chased the pace two wide, bumped with BLAZING TYREEK near the quarter pole and faltered. BLAZING TYREEK raced off the pace three wide, bumped
near the quarter pole and retreated. EL TEKILERO set the pace in the two path and was through after a half.

in the three path while under a ride around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, sustained her bid passing the eighth pole, but evened out in
the final furlong to show. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL floated out to the five path around the first turn and advanced to show the way in the three path down the
backstretch, was cued in the two path midway around the far turn, but faded between foes in the stretch. RECONNECTING bumped with an outer foe at the
start, laid off the pace in the four path, fanned out to the nine path turning into the lane, but made no impact. NIGHTSABER (GB) tracked in the five path,

Footnotes
LADY MADONNA was reluctant to load, had her head turned at the start but was still away in good order, tracked the pace three wide, rallied through the
lane and was up late. HIDDEN PRESENCE raced off the pace four wide, made good progress four wide around the far turn, rallied outside, reached even
terms late but was outkicked. SPALIDAY raced well back two and three wide, swung eight wide in upper stretch and rallied for the show. REDO saved
ground off the pace, cut the corner into the lane, made progress in upper stretch then flattened out in the final furlong. CELEBRITY RO set the pace in the
two path and led until deep stretch. JUST MARYANN failed to menace while racing three and four wide. Z TRAIN (IRE) raced two and three wide in
midpack and lacked a clear path through the stretch run. STAR PERFORMANCE stalked the pace two wide and weakened in the final sixteenth. FINAL
DRAFT prompted the pace three wide and faded in the drive. PRISCILLA'S COVE raced in range two wide, waited for room near the quarter pole, was
briefly urged in upper stretch then was blocked through the final sixteenth. BORED NO MORE trailed three and four wide, got out about twelve wide turning
for home and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
CONCRETE GLORY set the pace in the two path, was roused along the inside midway around the turn, and kicked away on his left lead under a drive.
LIGHTNING TONES trailed in the two path, fanned out to the nine path under a drive turning into the stretch, and rallied for place. THOUGHT raced off the
pace along the inside, was cued early into the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane, and kept on for show. THE DISTRACTOR had to
steady near the five-eighths, prompted the pace in the four path, bid in the two path around the turn, but faded from the four path in the stretch. MORGAN
POINT bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated in the four path but made no impact in the three path down the lane. CELESTIAL GLAZE bumped with
an outer foe at the start, then had to steady nearing the five-eighths, tracked in the three path, was ridden along the inside into the stretch, but flattened.
ZYDECEAUX stalked in the five path but weakened in the stretch. BIRD WILDCAT chased in the six path but was no menace.
