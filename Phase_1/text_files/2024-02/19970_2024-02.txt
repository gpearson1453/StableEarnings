Footnotes
IT'S A PITY settled inside, slipped through at the top of the stretch and quickly drew away while kept to his task. T'WAS THE NIGHT set a pressured pace,
lost the advantage in the stretch and lasted for the place. VESELSKY raced off the leaders, angled wide in the stretch and closed well. BRASS MONKEY
forced the pace outside to the stretch and weakened. WHISKEY PRIZE dropped back between foes then inside and lacked a rally. KNOCKOUT WIN
stalked the pacesetters three wide, was asked for run on the turn then proved empty in the stretch. HUMBLE JOE moved very wide on the turn and gave
way. LORD SEABEE lagged far behind and trailed throughout.

furlong marker and dug in gamely inside to the finish. BE WATER chased on the inside, angled out at the quarter pole, rallied mildly and earned the show
spot. BULLET ON TAP was off a bit slow, raced off the pace and rallied mildly on the rail in the stretch. CEDAR VALLEY raced two wide off the pace, came
two wide into the lane and finished evenly. DUNE JUMPER stalked the leaders, chased three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a
rally. APPEALINGTOTHE EYE was off a bit slow, raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. AZTEC BAY raced off the pace inside and did not

Footnotes
SWANS ISLAND set the pace, shook clear entering the turn, responded when roused, pulled away and was kept to the task. NEIGHBELLINE chased close
up three wide, moved up on the turn, rallied in the stretch but clearly second best. STELLA MIA was outrun early, closed belatedly and was along for the
show spot. EVERHEART chased between rivals, chased on the turn, weakened and lost third late. BAYNHAM raced off the raill, off the pace, went three or
four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. OUR LADY IN RED broke a step slow, raced close up early on the rail, was in a bit tight at the half mile marker,
then chased inside and faded. PICARDY was fractious in the gate, raced off the pace and did not factor. GOLDEN BOSS LADY chased and gave way.

LA LUISA close up inside, bid to the front midway on the turn in the two path, quickly drew off and was ridden out. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO lacked
speed, advanced inside then made a gradual late gain. ROAD TO DREAMS rallied three wide on the turn and continued willingly. SIRENETTA dropped well
behind then picked off rivals with late energy. BELLA MARIA dropped far back then passed rivals without menacing. MYTHREEBUTTERFLIES broke alertly
and moved clear inside, was collared on the turn and faded. ASTONISHING ANABEL chased off the leaders three wide and began weakening on the turn.
CINNAMON DREAM trailed for half mile racing wide then passed fading rivals. SWEET LILLY FACTUM lacked speed and faded steadily. SONET'S NAME
prompted the pace along the inside early then stopped abruptly.

BEYOND A MILLION settled off pace wide, advanced on the final turn then edged clear late under a drive. MERCY MERCY hustled to the front before
quarter mile, led to the final sixteenth and weakened. CARLY HUSTLE saved ground off the pace then flattened out in the stretch. IPSUM GRATUS
bumped at the start, pursued outside then proved empty in the stretch. BRODY SLAM showed speed from the gate then faded before half a mile and was
no factor. TILSA moved off the leaders outside and lacked a rally. LONDONDERRY bumped at the start, moved extremely wide on the final turn.
CANOOCHEE dropped back after the start and was always outrun.

COUNTERSPY controlled the pace, repelled a challenge nearing the quarter pole then widened eagerly through the stretch while ridden out. SPLENDOR
BEAUTY close up from the outset, went after the winner on the final turn and was easily second best. WHISKEYINTHEJARO trailed for half a mile then
offered some late energy. YULETIDE GALLOP raced in closest pursuit of the winner for half a mile and faltered. CATALEYA STRIKE saved ground, was
put to urging on the final turn and weakened. GUCCI MAN moved slightly closer after half a mile then faded. WICKED SECRET lacked speed outside and
was never a factor. FIRST MONEY briefly close outside, was asked for run after half a mile then gave way. MANAYUNK was urged just off the leaders in
the opening quarter then stopped abruptly.
