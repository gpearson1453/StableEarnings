Footnotes
RIVIERA SUNRISE tracked the solid early pace from the outside, was guided to the two path entering the turn and was well placed at the quarter pole,
slipped to the inside into upper stretch and gained ground nearing the furlong marker, rallied and shifted two wide approaching the sixteenth-pole,
responded to urging into deep stretch and got up in the final strides to prevail. SUPERSONIC FLYER broke alertly, showed good early speed and set the
pace into the turn, carved out solid fractions while clear to the quarter marker, maintained a clear lead into the stretch, was kept to task while holding foes at
bay into the final sixteenth, was all out in deep stretch and was tagged on the wire for the win, while just holding for second at the finish. TRULY FABULOUS
raced close up to the solid early pace, chased three wide and between rivals at the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, rallied three wide inside of the
furlong marker, came within aim in deep stretch and just missed for the win and place, while clear of the rest for the show. JASMINE CHIEFTAIN stalked the
solid early pace from the outside, chased four wide to the quarter marker and came widest into the stretch, lost ground approaching the furlong pole,
re-rallied in the final sixteenth but could not impact the top three at the finish. CRY ME A RUNNER stalked the solid early pace from the inside, tipped two
wide for the drive, chased to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. MISS SKI chased the solid early pace while between runners, was guided to the rail
entering the turn and was outrun to the quarter marker, ran in pursuit two wide into the stretch, was gaining in the final sixteenth but needed more in the late
stages.

marker and loomed into upper stretch, vied for the lead at the furlong marker and took command past mid-stretch, was kept to task into the final sixteenth
and kicked clear in deep stretch. UPRIGHT tracked the early pace two wide and between runners into the first turn, stalked the decent pace through the
backstretch run and was well positioned heading into the far turn, chased DEO to the quarter marker while three wide, rallied into the stretch and vied for the
lead at the furlong marker, could not keep pace with the winner into the final sixteenth and held well in the end for second. VINNIEBOB allowed to settle
while not far back to begin, tracked the early pace three wide along the first turn, pulled on the rider into the backstretch run, came in a bit tight at the
half-mile pole and checked at that station, was guided to the inside heading into the second turn and saved ground to the quarter marker, rallied in upper
stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, was outkicked into the final sixteenth and won the nod for show honors at the finish. DEO broke alertly, cleared
the field leaving the start and showed the way into the first turn, drew to a clear lead into the backstretch run and set decent fractions to the half-mile marker,
controlled the pace into the far turn and remained clear at the quarter pole, came under pressure nearing the furlong marker and was overtaken at
mid-stretch, gave way into the final sixteenth and just missed for third. MISCHIEF'S THIRSTY was allowed to settle, saved ground into the first turn and was
unhurried through the backstretch run, chased two wide into the second turn, improved position into the stretch and offered a mild late rally. UPDRAFT
stalked the early pace three wide into the first turn, was well positioned through the backstretch run and chased two wide into the second turn, lost ground
approaching the quarter marker, ran evenly into the stretch and weakened in the final sixteenth. L L L COOL was forwardly placed leaving the start, tracked
the early pace from the inside, was well positioned while saving ground through the backstretch run, lost position into the far turn and tired in the stretch

CLASS CODE stalked the early pace from the outside and raced three wide along the first turn, tracked the moderate pace from the outside through the
backstretch run, advanced into the far turn and came within aim three to four wide at the quarter marker, was roused into the stretch and vied for the lead at
the furlong marker, battled with SHANGHAI MIST while on even terms with that rival into the final sixteenth, took a narrow lead in deep stretch and held in
the final strides to determinedly prevail. SHANGHAI MIST broke alertly, showed good early speed and assumed command away from the start, showed the
way into the first turn and set moderate fractions into the backstretch run, was well handled into the far turn and set the pace while off of the rail at the
quarter marker, dug in into upper stretch and held foes at bay approaching the furlong pole, met the bid of CLASS CODE nearing the sixteenth-marker,
battled gamely into deep stretch and just missed for the win, while holding for place honors at the finish. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS was allowed to settle
while never far back, saved ground into the first turn and was well positioned into the backstretch run, chased two wide into the far turn and rallied into the
stretch, came in tight past mid-stretch, was boxed in into the final sixteenth and won the nod for third at the finish. DRAMATIZER settled off of the early pace
and maintained a two wide path into the first turn, was well placed through the backstretch run and saved ground into the second turn, gained ground
nearing the quarter marker then waited for racing room nearing the top of the lane, found room into the stretch and loomed at the furlong marker, was
outfinished into deep stretch and just missed for show honors at the wire. TURA LURA was forwardly placed leaving the start, stalked the early pace two
wide along the first turn and attended to the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance into the far turn and chased two to three
wide at the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground into upper stretch, shifted out and re-rallied into the final sixteenth and was outfinished in deep stretch.

Footnotes
CANELITO angled over after the break but was still caught two to three wide into the clubhouse turn, was content to settle near the rear of the compact field,
began to advance on the leaders from the half-mile marker through the far turn, deftly navigated from the two path to swing four wide in the clear for the
stretch run, responded to strong handling and wore down the dueling leaders in the final furlong despite running on the left lead. GORDY'S BOY was
hustled from the gate and easily took over the lead before the turn, was allowed to dictate a slow pace with WARRENS WORLD attending close to the
outside, quickened and hooked up with that rival passing the quarter pole, dueled gamely down the stretch, was able to get a nose in front late but was
passed by the winner near the wire. WARRENS WORLD broke well and showed some natural early speed then was content to stalk just off the flank of
GORDY'S BOY two deep through the far turn, cruised up to put the pressure on in earnest after passing the three-furlong marker, took a short lead and held
on stubbornly to deep stretch, giving way grudgingly to GORDY'S BOY for the place. MADE THE TEAM raced near the back of the tight field for the first half
mile, then responded when asked to to on from the seven-sixteenths pole, made a sweeping move to join the leaders three wide at the quarter pole, dueled
to mid-stretch but was unable find another gear when needed and came up short of a minor award. MY DAD IS THIRSTY tracked three wide but close up
through the first turn and down the backstretch, went into a drive from the five sixteenths pole and finished with some interest but was unable to improve.
PLAYBOY STYLE trailed the field though not far back through the early going, began to lose ground on the turn near the seven-sixteenths pole and came
under a drive, was kept to task and managed to pass one near the finish. TITOS WITH A TWIST was not asked for speed from the break but was forwardly
place while taking a spot on the rail, was content to track the slow pace to the far turn from a couple of lengths behind kept that position through the far turn
then struggled to go on with the rest in the final quarter mile and was outkicked in the stretch run.

Footnotes
LADY GREGORY rated off of the solid early pace while not far back to begin, saved ground into the turn then waited for racing room at the quarter marker,
found a seam into upper stretch and split rivals past the three-sixteenths marker, came within aim of the lead at mid-stretch and battled with
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER into the final sixteenth, shook free from the stubborn runner-up in deep stretch and held in a drive to prove best.
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER broke alertly, ceded the early lead and stalked the leading pair while a bit rank heading into the turn, was taken to the outside
along the bend and gained ground three wide at the quarter marker, shifted four wide into the stretch and vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, took a
narrow lead at mid-stretch and battled with LADY GREGORY into the final sixteenth, was bested by the winner in deep stretch and just held for second at
the finish. MO TOWN GAL was allowed to settle in the early stages, gained ground two wide into the turn, shifted four wide for the drive and ran evenly to
mid-stretch, finished well into the final sixteenth and just missed for place honors at the finish. CODE RIBBON took back off of the solid early pace, was
guided to the outside and raced three wide into the turn, improved position at the quarter marker and swung five wide into the stretch, closed willingly while
widest in the final furlong and just missed for the minor awards. ROSES R BLUE settled off of the quick early pace, saved ground into the turn and trailed to
the quarter marker, improved position at mid-stretch and found her best stride late. HEART ON THE RUN was prominent leaving the break and closely
attended to the solid early pace, advanced into the turn and pressed TONI TWO POCKET heading to the quarter marker, vied for the lead into upper
stretch, was outkicked at the furlong marker and gave way in the final stages. TONI TWO POCKET was hustled away from the start, assumed command
and set a solid pace into the turn, was pressed along the bend and carved out solid fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken into the stretch and tired
in the final furlong.

TIGER TOO tracked behind the speed duel to the turn, went into a drive from the seven-sixteenths pole, swing four wide into the stretch, finished well under
steady handling while drifting out some in the final yards. J D'S RUDE BOY lagged near the back of the field through the first quarter mile, went into an
extended drive from the seven-sixteenths marker, swung five wide into the stretch and was finishing well under steady handling then took up just before the
wire. TRINIDAD made some contact with TALBOT BAY after the break, then was outrun in the early going, made some forward progress through the turn,
was poised to make a run in the stretch but got stuck behind a wall of horses in the stretch, finally got room in the shadow of the wire and surged to gain
third. SHARONA'S WILD BOY broke well the was hooked on the outside of a three horse speed duel, battled gamely to deep stretch and finished well under
strong handling but was passed in the final yards. ZEUS' WAR was hustled from the break and was inside of three horses contesting the early pace, put a
head in front in the stretch, battled gamely to deep stretch but came up short in a good effort. TALBOT BAY took a light bump from OUR BOLD PRICE after
the break, then was bumped again a few strides out by TRINIDAD and in turn forced to bump with OUR BOLD PRICE again, had to take up slightly to
regroup, then made some forward progress in the middle of the race while saving ground, followed ZEUS' WAR into the stretch but had nowhere to run, got
a hole a furlong out but was unable to find the needed response. OUR BOLD PRINCE broke out and made light contact with TALBOT BAY at the break
then was bumped again a few strides out, was keen and a bit hard to place but rushed up to become the middle horse in the speed duel, was the first of the
three to come under pressure but battled to mid-stretch then weakened in the final furlong. GABBY HAYES stumbled badly at the start, lost the rider, was
caught after the race and walked off. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE START, CONCLUDING THAT #4
GABBY HAYES CAUSED HIS OWN ISSUES AND NO CHANGE WAS WARRANTED. THE JOCKEY ON #8 J.D.'S RUDE BOY LODGED AN OBJECTION
AGAINST THE JOCKEY OF #3 TIGER TOO FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH. THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED THE OBJECTION AND
ALLOWED THE RESULTS TO STAND.

Footnotes
ATTENZIONE was unhurried early and content to trail the field while saving all the ground, was still last as the field approached the quarter pole, swung out
to the five path for the stretch run and ran on strongly down the middle of the track to be along in time. HAPPY DOES raced between horses in the tracking
group while pulling the rider through the first turn, settled down for the backstretch run, came under a drive passing the seven-sixteenths pole, made only
mild improvement to the stretch, then was kept to task under strong handling and outfinished the rest for second. SEA OF LIBERTY was off a beat slow and
broke outward, then floated four wide through the first turn, remained forwardly placed but in the four path down the backstretch and through the far turn,
launched a bid from near the five-sixteenths, finished willingly under strong handling and intermittent urging and won a tight photo to earn the third prize.
AMERICA GREAT stalked the WODETON (FR) to the far turn, went to challenge for the lead with three furlongs to run, dueled with that stubborn rival to
deep stretch, gained the advantage passing the furlong marker but was passed in the final yards. SHOT OF A LIFETIME allowed to settle mid-pack from the
break, went three wide through the first bend then dropped back in the field down the backstretch, responded when the pace of the race quickened, saved
some ground through the far turn then was finishing willingly but got stuck behind horses and boxed in for the length of the stretch run. WODETON (FR)
broke awkwardly to the inside and brushed lightly with ATTENZIONE then was still able to win the race into the turn without too much prompting, then
allowed to set a moderate, uncontested pace for the first half-mile, took on the challenge from AMERICA GREAT near the three-sixteenths pole, dueled with
that one gamely to deep stretch then weakened in the final sixteenth. ECOLOGIST saved all the ground, raced close up early to the half-mile marker, had to
be ridden to keep up from that point, dropped back to last and chased the field home.
