Footnotes
DUEL FUEL unhurried early to trail into the far turn, rallied on the bend saving ground, cut the corner turning for home to engage the leaders and pulled
clear down the stretch. KLAATU prompted the pace throughout from six wide, loomed at the head of the lane, could not match the winner and kept on
willingly to be second best. JACK'S ADVANTAGE tracked the leader from the seven path to the far turn, rallied to threaten at the quarter pole, lost position
while well wide coming for home and gained ground late to get the show. ONLYATTHESHOE sped to a clear lead coming out of the first turn while kept well
off the rail, responded when engaged leaving the quarter pole and weakened in deep stretch. EMPEROR'S GOLD was pulled up on the first turn and was
vanned off.

Footnotes
EPICUREAN stalked the pace from three wide, rallied to engage the leader into the turn, took command on the bend, drew away in upper stretch
convincingly. LADY LOTTIE set a pressured pace throughout, responded well when challenged, was no match for the winner and finished willingly to be
second best. SHEWEARSMYRING slow early to trail in upper stretch and found her best stride late to be gaining ground in deep stretch. OAXACA pressed
the pace from between rivals to five-sixteenths pole and finihsed evenly. LUCKY TUESDAY tracked the leaders to the turn and lacked a closing response.

SHOW SLIDING HOME set a pressured pace from the inside dueling to the quarter pole, shook free of the presser in upper stretch and repelled the late bid
of the runner-up in a game effort. CALBOYZEKE stalked the dueling pacesetters through the turn, cut the corner coming home, rallied up the rail and
couldn't get to the winner. WEEKEND BUZZ pressed the pace from two wide taking brief leads through the turn, kept on down the lane but weakened in
deep stretch to be out-finished by the top pair. MISTER MOBIL well placed tracking the pace and lacked a closing rally. KARAMEL CORN was not a threat.

Footnotes
BLAME IT ON EDDIE bumped at the start, was taken in hand early, rushed up between horses leaving the first turn to take command at the five-eighths
pole, opened a clear advantage and widened having never been challenged. PARKER set the pace through the first turn, settled to stalk the leader down
the backside and kept on to the wire as second best while no match for the winner. EXALTED JOY trailed for the first half mile while racing wide, continued
to be wide in the far turn while making a steady advance and ground his way to the show spot. BOSS BEAR tracked the leaders from the rail saving ground
the entire trip and failed to menace at any time. AT THE BEACH tracked the leaders through the final bend and faded in the lane. GILLIGAN squeezed at
the start while being jostled between rivals and went one-paced as a no threat.

be second best. JETTIN PEGASUS unhurried in the early going to trail and rallied mildly through the lane to be best o the rest. SUZY Q THE QUEEN
reserved off the leaders through the turn and passed tired rivals when called upon. LET'S BE HONEST prompted the pace for a half mile and flattened out.

STICK AROUND unhurried in the early going to trail, steadily advanced up the inside in the final turn, angled out at the head of the lane and wore the
pacesetter down in deep stretch. PARLAY CHARLIE set a pressured pace throughout, responded when called upon turning for home and could not hold off
the winner late. OLYMPIC WINGS pressed the pace from the inside to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. JUSTWORTHASHOT chased the

Footnotes
G T THREE FIFTY stalked the pacesetter through the turn, rallied two wide to engage the leader turning for home and drew away down the lane. MEDIA
DARLING set the pace on a clear lead, had no answer when challenged by the winner and finished willingly as second best. STUNT MAN chased the
leaders throughout and failed to gain ground. KNOCK WOOD reserved to race mid-pack and showed some mild late interest. ELLIOT THE DRAGON went
evenly lacking a closing rally. PALACE TEMPTATION failed to menace. PAINT THE TOWN was never a threat. OUR BUCKWHEAT was not a factor.
DASH OF FIRE was outrun.
