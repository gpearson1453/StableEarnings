LIGHT MAN showed the way in hand just off the inside before tucking inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide
into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair whittling away at getting on near even terms, came out under a left handed crop bumping SAFALOW'S
MISSION into CLEVER FOREVER in the final forty yards and lasted on the wire. CLEVER FOREVER broke in at the start bumping DOC ADVANTAGE,
chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the top pair inside
the final furlong, got bumped by SAFALOW'S MISSION due to the pressure of the aforementioned foe coming out under a left handed crop forty yards from
home and missed at the end while up for the place honors. SAFALOW'S MISSION coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide in aim of the leader
coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in between foes through the final furlong whittling away at the leader in
tandem with CLEVER FOREVER to his outside when bumped forty yards from home by the eventual winner and in turn bumped that outside rival before
missing at the end when along for the show honors. PROVISION chased just off the inside and then along the inside coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. NOBLE HUNTSMAN chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. DOC ADVANTAGE got bumped at the start by CLEVER FOREVER, who
broke inwards, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and weakened.
