Footnotes
OOPSIE DOOPSIE pressed the pace from two wide to the head of the lane, engaged the pacesetter in upper stretch, dueled through the lane and prevailed
late in the drive. BANK BUSTER set the pace from the fence under steady pressure, responded when challenged turning for home, battled through the lane
in a game effort and was out-finished in the final yards. WICKED WONDER squeezed at the start to be forced to the rear of the field, tracked the leaders
from the fence, saved ground cutting the corner turning for home and gained ground in the lane. IMA SURE BET slow early to be the distant trailer and
showed late interest in the stretch. MY D'VALENTINE stalked the pace into the turn, mounted a three wide early bid on the turn and flattened out in the
stretch. ONACOUNTA chased the early pace and faded.

IMA MOM prompted the pace to the top of the stretch, engaged the pacesetter in mid-stretch and wore that one down late in the drive to prevail. RUNAWAY
HAPPY set a well rated pace in hand to upper stretch, dueled through the lane while failing to change leads and was out-finished in deep stretch. MY GIRL
KEW tracked the leaders into the turn, loomed up from three wide at the quarter pole and flattened out in the lane. KISS ME QUICK well placed from the rail
to the turn, lost position dropping back on the bend and kept on evenly through the stretch. FANCIFUL failed to menace. SPUNKY ONE was not a factor.

Footnotes
POLITICAL unhurried for the first half mile, circled turning for home and closed with a rush to be up in time. AMERICAN NIGHTMARE prompted the pace
from three wide to the far turn, took command at the quarter pole, dug-in through the lane repelling all challenges and was caught in the final strides by the
late closing winner. CITY PLAN pressed the pace from between rivals to the head of the lane to loom boldy and was out-finished in the drive. KADESH leapt
at the start, raced mid-pack down the backside, rallied four wide in upper stretch to be prominent, was held up while attempting to lug-in down the lane and
was outkicked late when having straightened away. ORO DE MORO MORO tracked the leaders from the fence while held up off heels leaving the first turn,
continued to be well palced along the fence in striking position and failed to mount a closing bid. SOUTHERN WILL went one-paced. HADDASSAH'S DEVIL
failed to menace. PATIO PARTY set a pressured pace to the far turn and gave way. GILES was outrun.

FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP set a well rated pace on a comfortable lead, widened the advantage when called upon and drew off unchallenged. CATEGORY TEN
reserved off the pace for the first half, made a teady advance on the turn and continued to grind down the lane to be second best. STOP THE SPREAD
prompted the pace to the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch while racing erratically continuously lugging in. CAMBIASO unhurried early to be near
the rear of the field and made a mild rally in the stretch. BROADWAY SKY failed to menace and was not persevered with. POT COMMITTED was a
non-factor and gallopped out to the wire. GOLD HERITAGE stalked the pace for five-eighths, came up empty and was eased to the wire.

TIME THE AVENGER well rated on the lead, responded when called upon to open a clear advantage in mid-stretch and held sway. PLAIN OR PEANUT
prompted the pace throughout and kept coming through the lane finishing willingly. TIMESATAPPIN trailed most of the way and rallied mildly in the stretch.
SMALL SAILOR stalked the pace through the turn in striking distance and lacked a closing response. SERGEANT COUNTZLER chased the leaders down
the backside and faded. EL BAMBINO was not a factor.

Footnotes
ONE STEP ASIDE tracked the pacesetters through the turn, made a steady advance from three wide down the lane and prevailed late in the drive. C V
DYNAMIC pressed the pace from two wide to the top of the lane, took command in mid-stretch, dug-in when challenged late in the lane and just missed in a
good effort. OLLIE'S FOLLY dueled on the lead from the fence through the turn, battled to midway down the stretch and weakened late in the drive.
WEEKEND RETREAT reserved off the pace through the turn and rallied mildly in the stretch. SWAYBACK MOBIL failed to menace. GO TOTHE
PRINCIPAL was never a threat.
