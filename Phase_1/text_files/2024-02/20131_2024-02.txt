ECONOMICAL vied outside a rival before moving clear approaching the half mile pole, edged away while nudged along mid turn, kept on under right
handed asks past mid stretch and held firm. YOU ENJOY MYSELF , three deep pursuing into the turn, shifted out entering the lane, closed steadily on his
left lead and earned the place. CURLY ESA broke in the air, recovered and was sent up to chase between runners, angled four wide into the lane, dropped
back in a bit nearing the furlong grounds and kept on with good energy. GO LAKER GO broke slowly, angled out early while well off the pace, raced four to
five wide into the stretch and had belated interest. BRAYBRAY angled out nearing the turn then chased in the clear, circled four wide into the stretch but
came up empty. MIGHTY TIGER vied inside the winner through the early stages, chased inside a pair of rivals leaving the far turn, failed to kick on past the
three eighths and tired.

Footnotes
SHARP LORENZO , taken snugly in hand and well off the pace into the backstretch, was angled out near the five eighths then commenced a run leaving
the half, rolled up five wide to engage rivals from the outside approaching the quarter pole, emerged in a battle with PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL leaving the
three sixteenths, gained the advantage dueling past the furlong grounds, responded to left handed asks and edged away nearing the wire.
PLEASEUSETHEPORTAL , five wide leaving the seven eighths, rated off the embattled leaders, moved up menacingly into the far turn, bid four deep and
took a slim lead nearing the quarter pole, was joined from his outside soon after, sparred with the winner to deep stretch then gave way grudgingly. WELL
IMAGINE THAT angled off heels into the first turn then moved up to stalk off the rail, edged up and bid three deep leaving the far turn, held a short lead
between runners past the five sixteenths, failed to quicken with the top pair in upper stretch, shifted out and churned on to gain the show. LITE RANCHIN
KID sped to the front then dropped in when clearing into the first turn, was joined past the seven eighths then headed, dueled along towards the rail from the
five eighths to the five sixteenths, came out a path nearing the lane and weakened. GENERAL CROOK , brushed and steadied soon after the break, was
forced out six wide by FERRARI RED entering the first turn, regrouped and gained off the inside into the far turn, shifted in towards the rail to pursue past
the five sixteenths then weakened. SHINING TIGER brushed with a foe soon after the start , raced four wide into the first, dropped in a couple of paths and
moved to a short lead outside LITE RANCHIN KID was re engaged by that one mid way through the backstretch, dueled between runners leaving the three
eighths, steadied when not quite quickening with the leaders near the quarter pole and gave way. R BARRACUDA , towards the inside, was not a factor.
FERRARI RED steadied off heels soon after the break then got out multiple paths entering the first turn, checked repeatedly when difficult to settle through
the opening half mile then dropped back.

Footnotes
LAST MARTINI was rated back after and alert start, raced four wide and to the inside of a rival leaving the eighths, exchanged brushes with MACEDONIAN
RULER entering the backstretch, dropped in a bit and took closer order leaving the far turn, brushed with GOPHER GOLD when working outward for room
nearing the lane, straightened away then leveled off under strong left handed encouragement leaving the furlongs grounds, engaged the embattled leaders
from their outside a sixteenth from home, sustained his surge to take command late and was edging away a bit at the wire. EAST RAND stalked three wide
outside GOPHER GOLD, moved to take on that rival after a half mile, sparred on near even terms from the three eighths, stayed on between rivals leaving
the sixteenth pole and continued valiantly to the wire. AVALON KING cleared early then dropped in to set the pace in about the two path, dug in when
confronted nearing the half mile pole, dueled on a slim lead from the three eighths to about mid stretch, could not quite go on to the inside of horses leaving
the sixteenth marker and weakened very late. BEAT THE HEAT , in close soon after the break, dropped far off the pace, came three wide for the drive and
had late interest to the inside of a rival. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) lost ground five wide, brushed with the winner a couple of times entering the
backstretch, remained well off the rail when edging up to be in range entering the far turn, shifted very wide in upper stretch but came up empty. GOPHER
GOLD angled out early then moved up to stalk, gave chase four wide leaving the five sixteenths, was brushed and fanned wider nearing the lane and
weakened.

Footnotes
STARDUST DREAMS , with the pace outside a pair of dueling rivals, cruised clear leaving the far turn, was nursed along well off the rail into the lane,
responded when put to right handed asking in mid stretch then widened while kept alert. DUKE GIRLS chased outside a rival, circled five wide into the
stretch, kept on willingly and gained the place in the final yards. BITCOIN BURGLAR vied between runners early, pursued the winner while two wide into the
lane, kept on with effort past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. NORTHERN LINCHPIN , in a bit close at the break, pursued three wide and to
the inside of DUKE GIRLS leaving the far turn, was under pressure off the rail into the stretch but came up empty. BETSY IS THE CODE , four wide mid
turn, failed to respond. SASSY TINKERBELL vied inside under a ride, failed to go on entering the stretch and weakened. SAL GAL broke poorly, dropped
far back early, raced off the rail into the lane, shifted out and had some belated interest.
