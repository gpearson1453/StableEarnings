Footnotes
DESVIO stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep leaving the turn, secured command in upper stretch, eagerly drew off
and was under brisk urging in the stretch. WORK HARD , in hand lacking room along the inner rail inside the three eighths pole, was behind horses in upper
stretch, swung to the five path near the eighth pole and rallied late. ROCKET NIGHT , a forward factor in the two path between horses around the turn,
finished willingly. VILALUZ , unhurried behind horses down the backstretch, swung five wide leaving the turn, bumped with GLASS OF COURAGE near the
three sixteenths pole then lugged in. GLASS OF COURAGE swerved out leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, bumped with VILALUZ in mid
stretch and gave way. FLUFF THE PILLOW showed speed along the inner rail and gave way entering the stretch. BAD ADVICE showed speed in the two
path between horses, moved to the inner rail turning for home, raced on his left lead and faltered.

Footnotes
STOP THE CAP settled back off of a contested pace while three deep, took closer order mid turn, shifted out, responded and bid four wide outside rivals
soon into the lane, wrested near the three sixteenths and steadily widened under a drive. MO TOUGH rated along the inside, edged up past the three
eighths, eased out and bid between runners entering the stretch, gave hard chase of the winner through the final three sixteenths and kept on willingly to be
well clear of the rest. LOOKING FOR WATER checked when impeded by NAMI leaving the gate, recovered and found herself well back and well wide,
dropped in to avoid the rider less NAMI near the five eighths, gathered some momentum around the turn then churned on through the drive.
LETITGOTOVOICEMAIL , three deep with the early pace, emerged in a duel outside DRY HUMOR around the turn, held the advantage entering the lane,
could not resist challenges leaving the quarter pole and gave way. DRY HUMOR moved up to command leaving the chute and set a pressured pace
between rivals, sparred to the inside of LETITGOTOVOICEMAIL around the turn, kept on with effort to the three sixteenths then weakened. FORGOTTEN
GIFT vied inside a pair of runners through the backstretch run, eased back a bit and stayed on to stalk around the turn, remained a presence to the quarter
pole then gave way. OJITOS BELLOS gave early chase between rivals and tired. NAMI stumbled badly leaving the gate and unseated her rider. There was
a stewards' inquiry into the start. No action was taken.

WORKISLIFE stalked the pace in the three path on the turn, swung wide at the head of the stretch, drifted wider in upper stretch, secured command inside
the eighth pole and drove clear. PETINGAS TWIN prompted the pace outside LIVEHAPPY, overtook that one turning for home, angled out near the eighth
pole and weakened. LIVEHAPPY showed speed inside horses, saved ground on the turn and gave way through the stretch. UNION BULLDOG , never a
factor, was three wide leaving the turn. KEIGS hugged the inner rail, chased the pace and gave way.

between runners into the turn, was coaxed along to maintain position mid turn, eased out three wide nearing the lane, closed under left handed asks, took
over from the embattled leaders leaving mid stretch then steadily drew away under a drive. BROTHER BELEN , bumped at the break, showed speed and
disputed the pace two wide and to the inside of ENTRUST through the backstretch run, was joined from his inside by GREAT CALL to briefly make in three
across mid turn, emerged in duel outside GREAT CALL soon into the stretch, fought on between runners in mid stretch then stayed on well to second best.
VERBIER rated behind foes while not too far back into the turn, was urged along mid turn then angled out, circled five wide into the lane, advanced outside
foes near mid stretch, switched over to his left lead when drifting in and churned on. GREAT CALL rated in range while saving ground, was sent through to
the inside of runners to join the pace fray mid turn, fought on along the rail to mid stretch then faded in the final seventy yards. SUCCEED , urged off the
pace, passed tiring rivals. LAST SECOND LOUIE , four wide outside runners while stalking the pace, failed to kick on while under a ride into the stretch and
weakened. ENTRUST , in the three path vying outside BROTHER BELEN, was under pressure between runners past the three eighths and faltered.

Footnotes
FRIGHTLAND bumped AGARRAMESIPUEDES when coming out at the break, stalked the pace outside horses down the backstretch, advanced three deep
on the turn, wrested command in upper stretch, responded to the whip in mid stretch and readily pulled away. STORMING CHROME set the pace along the
rail, weakened through the stretch and held the place. BROOKLYN GUY , three wide the first turn, moved to the inner rail on the backstretch, remained
along the rail and retreated the final half mile. AGARRAMESIPUEDES , bumped by FRIGHTLAND leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path between
horses entering the far turn, swung four wide turning for home and was no threat. CARVELLIAN QUEST , four wide the first turn, prompted the pace in the
two path for six furlongs then faltered. RAPPER ZAPPER , a forward factor along the inner rail for three furlongs, gave way on the backstretch. TRASH
TALKIN LARRY , four wide the far turn, was never a factor.

TENEBRIS , off a step slow, quickly advanced four deep on the turn, gained the lead approaching the stretch, was challenged on his inside by GOLDEN
CANDY in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth pole and dug in tenaciously to preail. GOLDEN CANDY , a forward factor in the three path between
horses mid way on the turn, challenged the winner in mid stretch and dug in gamely in a sharp effot. THE JUDGE AND JURY prompted the pace in the two
path between horses to mid turn, was shuffled back approaching the stretch, swung very wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. GOING TO THE LEAD ,
steadied in tight quarters between horses leaving the backstretch, swung five wide entering the stretch, drifted in near the sixteenth pole and failed to
menace. OUR PRIDE N JOY , steadied in traffic between horses leaving the backstretch, hugged the inner rail mid way on the turn, eased out for the drive
and was not a factor. ICING showed speed along the inner rail and gave way in upper stretch. BACKNTHEWOODS dropped back early.

Footnotes
SPICY MARGARITA prompted the pace in hand and to the outside of SPEAK YOUR MIND, moved alongside mid turn, dueled on near even terms into the
stretch, shook clear leaving the three sixteenths, kept on under left handed asks then was fully extended to prevail. CANOODLE dropped back off the early
pace while saving ground, gathered steam nearing the five sixteenths, swung out five wide for the drive, straightened away, leveled off to her best stride
inside the furlong grounds and closed nicely to gain. PROPER ATTIRE was steadied when put in close soon after the break, regrouped and edged up
behind rivals heading to the half, steadied off heels soon after, angled out, advanced four wide into the stretch, sustained to loom past mid stretch then hung
very late. WATCH YOUR TONE broke a step slow, recovered and moved up to be in range nearing the half, saved ground under coaxing mid turn, came
out soon into the stretch, moved up behind a rival near the sixteenth pole, altered back inward and kept on with interest. BOURBON WILDCAT stalked the
leaders three wide, was pushed along mid turn, continued off the rail into the stretch but came up empty. SPEAK YOUR MIND sped to the front and set the
pace towards the rail, was hounded leaving the far turn, dueled from the five sixteenths to upper stretch then weakened with about a furlong remaining.
OLIVE KAT gave brief chase between runners and tired.

ROMINSKI , bumped by TOP BOSS leaving the starting gate, drifted in on that one soon after the break, sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner
rail and was under the whip in mid stretch. EGO MAN saved ground around the turn, swung to the three path at the head of the lane and chased the winner
in a willing effort. JOHN THE BEAR raced in the two path on the turn, remained in the two path through the stretch and finished gamely inside horses.
SUPREME LAW circled the turn three wide, was fanned five wide turning for home and came up empty. JEOPARDY JAMES lacked speed, circled the turn
four wide, floated to the six path entering the stretch and failed to rally. SUMO hugged the inner rail through the stretch and lacked a rally. MYSTIC
O'SHAUNESIE , pinched back soon after the break, was outrun. TOP BOSS came out and bumped the winner at the break, steadied behind that one
shortly after the start, chased the pace for a half mile and gave way.

Footnotes
I HAVE COURAGE , four wide stalking the early pace, dropped in a path and edged closer into the turn, bid under a ride while three deep past the three
eighths, dueled into the lane, wrested command a furlong out then steadily drew away while kept to task. LUCKY LORRAINE , away awkwardly as she
tossed her head a bit as the gates sprung, regrouped and advanced to the inside of a rival nearing the turn, edged up behind the leaders mid turn, shifted
out for the drive and churned on to be along for the place. CALYPSO GHOST , away alertly, prompted the pace outside NO MORE MASK, drew alongside
that one leaving the far turn, dueled between runners past the five sixteenths to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and just got the bob for the show. NO
MORE MASK sped clear early, dropped in and set the pace, took pressure into the turn, dueled inside runners from the three eighths to mid stretch, failed to
match strides soon after, continued trying but was edged for third. GOLD TIME VIXEN rated close up about three wide early on, angled out into the turn,
moved four deep to threaten leaving the three eighths, forced the issue into the stretch then weakened. REDWHITEANDTACOS rushed up towards the
inside and gained a forward spot after a quarter mile, was under asking to hold position near the three eighths, failed to kick on approaching the stretch and
retreated. ILLUSION OF HOPE , sluggish from the gate, lagged off the pace, race two to three wide into the lane but failed to respond.
