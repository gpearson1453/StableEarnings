BROWN LIAISON was away alertly, set all the pace to cross over and held well in the drive to prove best under strong handling. REBA was hustled while
racing mid pack, made a three to four wide bid and finished gamely to the wire. FEELSSOGOODINLOVE chased two deep and kept on willingly to the wire.
FESSY was off a step slow, raced near the back early, swung out five wide into the upper lane and moved up late to improve position. MINNIE'S READY
was near the rail and weakened in the drive. RICHIE'S GAL dropped back early, raced near the inside and never threatened.

CREDITOR was hard sent to set the early pace, challenged through the far turn and held well to prove best under strong handling. MISS YOU NO MORE
pressed the early leader from the outside, aim past the quarter pole, dug in and finished gamely to the wire. ATHENIAN PRINCESS chased two deep
between near the five sixteenths pole and had not enough for the top pair. MOR FOXY chased from the outside, raced three to four wide around the far turn
and raced evenly. TEDDYISTRUCKING was off slowly, angled six wide into the upper stretch and never threatened. UNLIMITED GLORY saved ground and
never threatened.

JULIARD HONOR was hustled throughout, challenged the leader from the outside near the quarter pole, raced three wide into the upper stretch and just got
up under strong handling. RED RED WINE quick to begin to set the early pace and gave way grudgingly to the winner in the final stages. DONNAS FINAL
WORD chased the top pair, raced five wide into the upper lane, shifted in and finished gamely to the wire. QUEEN CORDELIA dropped back early, made a
three to four wide bid and closed in mildly. LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT void of early speed, saved ground and never menaced. HOT TUB HOTTIE chased the
pace from the inside and faded.
