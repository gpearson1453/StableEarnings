Footnotes
MAGICNTHEMOONLIGHT dueled for the early lead and made a three wide bid on the turn to gain a short lead, then turned back the bid from JEAN
VALJEAN by the quarter pole and then drew out in the lane to prove best under a drive. MEET ME AT MUNDIS was reserved early, inside on the turn and
tipped out two wide off the turn and finished well. EAGLES CRY was settled early on the inside, eased out on the turn and swung out five wide leaving the
turn and had a mild late kick. JEAN VALJEAN tracked the early pace three wide and made a four wide bid by the quarter pole but faded in the drive.
YOUNG SQUIRE lugged out shortly after the start leaving the chute and ended up far back, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. PICTOR
chased the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane and weakened. MOBEER dueled for the lead on the inside and then was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
CURLINGTON was well rated early along the inside, then was coaxed along the inside on the far turn, moved out to make a three wide bid by the quarter
pole, then came four wide off the turn to duel for command and then drove clear by the sixteenth marker to prove best. GRAB THE GOLD did not corner
well into the first turn and floated out four wide, then dropped to the inside to set the pace on the inside, then was confronted off the turn and shifted out to
duel for command by the furlong marker, but could not go with the winner late while being clearly second best. KAZ SWEET HEIST was void of early speed,
then advanced five wide on the far turn and came seven wide into the lane and was up for the show award. TRIBAL NOTION was allowed to settle early,
advanced three wide on the far turn and made a mild bid off the turn but flattened out, missed show award. PRATT was allowed to settle early, advanced
two wide on the turn and made a inside bid off the turn but flattened out late. HONORABLE AVENUE tracked the pace from the outside and made a four
wide bid by the quarter pole and came six wide off the turn but faded in the final furlong. REDEEM EDDIE was settled back early, advanced wide on the far
turn and came widest into the lane and had no rally. HERE'S WALDO was carried out into the five or six path into the first turn, then stalked the pace four to
three wide and tired in the drive. JUST GOT STARTED broke in the air at the start, moved up on the inside down the backstretch and then tired.

Footnotes
LEO'S PISCES moved up from between rivals to duel for the lead three wide by the half mile marker, then made a bid to shake clear and drop to the inside
on the turn, then was given a pop left handed with the crop and responded well to draw off smartly to prove much the best under mild encouragement.
STORMEY MONDAY broke in and bumped a rival at the start, then was close up early, then fell back on the turn, came four wide into the lane and came
again to gain the place award. STYLISH GIRLFRIEND was bumped hard at the start, then recovered and rushed up the inside to duel for command early,
then fell off the pace on the turn, came three wide off the turn and weakened. CARSONS COOL WOMEN was off slowly, then reserved early, three wide on
the turn and had a mild late rally. BANKERS ROSE GOLD stalked the pace four wide and then came up empty in the drive. LOOKING FANCY was far back
early and was not a threat. BETCHA BOOTS BABE broke in at the start, chased the pace on the inside and then weakened on the turn and then was eased
in the lane, walked off.

PUTTHEGLASSDOWN was well rated early on the inside, shifted out and made a four wide move on the turn, came five wide off the turn and made a bid
and drew out in the furlong grounds to prove much the best under a drive. DR RAGS vied for the lead three wide, made a bid to shake clear on the turn,
then turned back a bid from BEYOND THE BEND leaving the turn but then was confronted by the winner and proved to be no match for that rival, second
best. U U STAR broke out and bumped a rival at the start, then rushed up to be close up on the inside early, shuffled back on the turn, then made a inside
bid leaving the turn but flattened out, got show. BEYOND THE BEND tracked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid by the quarter pole and off the
turn but then was in tight leaving the furlong marker and faded, missed show award. JW'S THIRD MISCHIE was settled early three to four wide on the turn
and swung out six wide leaving the turn but had no rally. BOYS OF QUEENS was bumped at the start, reserved early and lacked a rally. THAT'S MY
BUSINESS vied for the lead on the inside and weakened.

Footnotes
DIVINE PROMISE prompted the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, then drew clear leaving the turn and then remained clear to
prove best under a drive. CELTIC REVIVAL pressed the pace from the inside, then was shuffled back on the turn, made a two to three wide bid off the turn
and finished willingly to be clearly second best. LUCKY BREEZE was settled early, three wide by the quarter pole and swung out six wide leaving the turn
and was up for the show award. MY SWEET SUMMER stalked the early pace four wide, made a three to four wide bid by the quarter pole but flattened out,
lost show award. LADYNESS was reserved early, advanced five wide by the quarter pole, swung out eight wide leaving the turn and had a belated rally.
TRECHMO GIRL was settled back early, four wide by the quarter pole and had a mild late kick. DUSTED was reserved early on the inside, three wide by
the quarter pole but lacked the needed rally. EMPRESS PALPATINE chased the pace from the outside and made a five wide bid by the quarter pole but
came up empty in the drive. CURLIN'S DOVE set a pressured pace towards the inside and then was on the inside on the turn and stopped.
