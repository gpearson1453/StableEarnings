RUFFNER angled to the inside and drew off to a long early lead, raced at the rail on the turn, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the turn and just
lasted; all out. MONEY MAC gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail, eased outward leaving the turn and just missed in a strong finish.
ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS exchanged contact with Floor It leaving the gate, gave chase through the backstretch and finished evenly to close the gap.
SMOKIN SMITTY chased through the backstretch, raced near the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. FLOOR IT exchanged contact with
Robbedinthebahamas leaving the gate then gave chase to no avail. CHASIN CHAPIN gave chase then weakened in the four path on the turn.

Footnotes
DIALHERUP stalked from the three path, started a bid past the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead two deep midway on the far turn, ran clear passing
the eighth pole, widened to late stretch then taken in hand nearing the wire. TIZ MICHELLE'S WAY settled in the three and four paths on the first turn, gave
chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for second later yards. DORITA'S HEART rated close about the
five path into the first turn then took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and showed the way from that point, came under pressure approaching the five
sixteenths, was met at the rail midway on the far turn and weakened leaving the eighth pole. GORMLEYESQUE stumbled leaving the gate then dropped
back and saved early ground, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, improved her position but flattened in the five
path on the far turn. SEEMS TO WHISPER rated close to the early pace about the four path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but flattened in the
four path on the far turn. SALTY SAUL was never a factor. SOME IS NINE had the early lead inside but was met at the nine sixteenths pole, faded through
the backstretch then eased the final quarter mile.

Footnotes
O'RIGSBY raced in the four path the first turn, gave chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and took the lead leaving the
turn, dueled clear mid-stretch and held well under steady handling. RED HOT TODDY saved ground close to the pace on the opening turn, gave chase
toward the three eighths pole, improved in the three and four paths on the far turn, was carried out leaving the turn but finished well to take second the final
yards. ONE CANDY CASTLE raced in the six path the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, took a brief lead toward the quarter
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, was met into the lane and relented the final sixteenth. TIME TO CHOOSE raced in the five path the first turn, picked
up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, angled out leaving the turn then flattened in the lane. IRISH FLIGHT
rounded the first turn about the four path, left the turn outside and showed little response. CALLISTO'S BRIGADE raced with the pace inside but dropped
back approaching the three eighths pole and weakened at the rail on the far turn. MACHEN IT RAIN took the lead while tapering to the inside and rated the
pace, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, was caught past the five sixteenths, checked toward the quarter pole and gave way.

Footnotes
BLUE TWIRLIN raced with the pace then drew to even terms nearing the three eighths pole, dueled for the nod approaching the five sixteenths, contested
nearest the rail at even terms on the far turn, raced clear past the eighth pole and held well under steady handling. BACKSTREET GAL settled in the three
path the first turn then eased out with a bid into the backstretch, steadily improved from that point, raced close in the four path on the far turn then dueled
through the stretch and took second later yards. MISS ANTIETAM settled in the four path the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole and
improved off the rail on the far turn, dug in leaving the turn but relented in the stretch duel for second. DALLAS exchanged contact with Hovel leaving the
gate then rated close inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, eased out toward the head of the
lane and passed some rivals. HONEYCAMP stumbled leaving the gate and raced in the three and four paths the opening turn, gave chase leaving the three
eighths pole and drew to even terms into the far turn, but dropped back into the lane and flattened stride inside the sixteenth pole. HOVEL was jostled at the
break then saved ground well back on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and passed some
rivals. LONDON GOLD raced in the six path the first turn then stalked into the backstretch, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened in
the six path on the far turn. TOUGH ENOUGH angled to the inside and rated the early pace, dueled at even terms from the three eighths pole, dropped
back at the rail leaving the quarter pole and weakened in the stretch. MARQUET CLASSIC exchanged contact with Hovel at the break, raced boxed at the
rail the first turn and showed little response. SISTER SPIRIT was not a factor.
