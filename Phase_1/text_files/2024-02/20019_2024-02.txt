Footnotes
DARTH rated in the two path, came under a ride going into the far turn, tipped out to the four path to bid passing the eighth pole, and inched past an inner
foe in the final sixteenth. FOXTROT HARRY set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the inside early around the far turn, dug in from the two path
into the final furlong, but was edged out by an outer foe late to place. REGGAE MAN was held up to trail in the three path turning into the backstretch, came
under a drive in the four path early around the far turn, floated out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on for show. GRAND TOWER pulled around
the first turn to prompt the pace in the four path down the backstretch, was cued in the three path midway around the far turn, floated out to the five path
passing the eighth pole, but evened out late. TIBERIAN SUN chased in the five path, angled out to the eight path under a drive in upper stretch, but made
no impact. SWEET TRAVELS tracked in the three path, was coaxed midway around the far turn, swung from the five path into the lane, but got shutoff and
had to steady just after the eighth pole, and could not make a bid. MISSION MIKE stalked in the five path turning into the backstretch but backed up around
the far turn. HERCULES N LOVE was out in the six path going into the first turn, raced off the pace in the five path down the backstretch, but failed to
menace.

Footnotes
AMERICAN ROCKETTE chased inside, tipped out under coaxing midway around the turn, swung from the seven path into the lane, and rallied past an
inner duo around the sixteenth. OLGA tracked in the six path, was roused in the four path passing the quarter, bid from the five path into the stretch, ran on
to briefly lead before the sixteenth, but was quickly overtaken by an outer foe to place. STEEL RACER bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked in the
two path, was ridden around the turn, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. AMERICAN OF COURSE set the pace in the three
path, was coaxed along the inside approaching the quarter, kicked on from the two path into the lane, but faded in the final furlong. SIMPLIFY (ARG) rated
in the four path, but made no impact from the six path in the stretch. ROSE E HOLIDAY trailed along the inside early and never threatened. SANDRA D
bumped with an inner foe at the start, prompted the pace in the five path but weakened in the stretch.

Footnotes
SIPHON CITY GIRL set the pace in the two path, drifted out under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out soon after and drew off under
right-handed pressure. MOBAY PRINCESS raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and
was up for the place in the final strides. COLLECTED DREAMS steadied near the half-mile pole, advanced at the rail around the turn, was a clear second
through much of the stretch but was caught late. ISAYSO was rank at the start and bumped GENTING, chased the pace three wide and lacked a closing
bid. GENTING was bumped at the start, pressed the winner in the three path, could not match strides in upper stretch, lugged in in midstretch and faltered.
AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF COLLECTED DREAMS AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE DOWN THE
BACKSTRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SOCIALLONGDISTANCE tracked inside, was coaxed passing the quarter, swung from the four path into the stretch, tipped out to bid in the six path passing
the eighth pole, and drew past an inner foe around the sixteenth. SOUPER ENERGIZER laid up close on the outer flank of the leader in the three path
turning into the backstretch, bid around the far turn, was roused while taking the lead and floating out to the five path passing the eighth pole, got caught by
the outer winner around the sixteenth, but held place. CAPTAIN ANTHONY was held up in the two path down the backstretch, coaxed while fanning out to
the six path at the top of the stretch, had to angle further out passing the eighth pole, and kept on for show. DIAMOND COOL chased in the three path, had
to steady between foes approaching the far turn, was driven along the inside around the far turn, but made no impact around the four path in the stretch.
TREASURE KING set the pace inside but yielded in the final furlong. CABLE BOSS trailed from the two to three paths down the backside and did not factor
from the center in the stretch. TAPIT BRIO rated in the four path but did not threaten from the six path down the lane, pulled up after the gallop out, and
walked off. SHANKAR raced wellback in the three path early and never menaced.

Footnotes
POUNCE showed the way while merging inwards around the first turn to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, was cued passing the quarter,
kicked away into the final furlong, and held sway. KIN'S CONCERTO laid off the pace in the two path, was roused from the rail into the far turn, swung out to
the six path at the top of the stretch, drifted into the two path, and ran on for place. TOP BLUE tracked inside, was ridden from the rail into the far turn, and
kept on for show. KALISPERA (IRE) raced wellback in the four path, was cued while merging into the two path entering the far turn, tipped out to the five
path passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly. CARESS stalked in the four path, got bumped by an inner foe passing the half, was coaxed along in the
two path early into the far turn, but flattened from the four path in the stretch. DE REGRESO laid in range in the five path, steadied passing the half, fanned
out to the eight path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. SCORPIA rated in the two path, swung out to the six path turning into the stretch, but made
no impact. ESCAPE ROOM trailed in the three path turning into the backstretch but had to steady passing the half. and could not make a bid. ROSIE
JEEKS raced off the pace in the four path and did not factor. FROSTED VICTORY chased in the four path, had to alter outward momentarily just after the
half, was ridden between foes in the four path around the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. JAYANA bumped with an inner foe at the start, was held up
along the inside early and never menaced. BEFORE YOU GO GO bumped with an inner foe at the start, laid up close in the two path turning into the
backstretch, pulled up just after the half, and was vanned off.

DANGEROUS RIDE chased the pacesetter two wide, angled four wide turning for home, steadily gained outside and was up on the wire.
THREETHIRTYTHREE slammed into the starting gate and nearly unseated the rider, raced well back inside, closed up the wire, took the lead in the final
strides but was nailed. KING CAB bumped at the start, set the pace well off the rail down the backstretch, remained clear in the two path rounding the far
turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, raced under hand urging throughout the stretch run and was caught late. BIG MARTINI saved ground in midpack,
angled three wide in upper stretch, rallied between foes and was outkicked. SOUTHERN DREAM lagged well back in the two path, angled out in upper
stretch and rallied belatedly. BERLONE was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. UNIKEE was bumped between foes at
the start, chased the pace three wide between foes, steadied leaving the three-eighths maker and faltered.

Footnotes
STONE SILENT was prompted along while up close in the two path, bid while floating out to the five path at the top of the stretch, and drew clear. CHOOSE
JOY bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, was ridden into the turn, angled out to the seven path at the top of the lane,
and ran on while on her left lead for place. FULMINATE set the pace in the two path, was cued while tipping out to the four path in upper stretch, but evened
out for show. SHASTA STAR trailed in the four path, was coaxed in the three path midway around the turn, fanned out to the nine path at the top of the
lane, and stayed on. BABY STEPS stalked in the three path, was cued midway around the turn, swung from the six path into the stretch, but flattened.
GLITTER UP chased in the two path, cut the corner turning into the lane, but faded on her left lead. CANADIANSWEETHEART tracked in the four path, was
cued between foes in the two path midway around the turn, but weakened in the stretch. THE ARCADIAN WAY bumped with an outer foe at the start, rated
inside but steadied going into the turn, and was no menace.

Footnotes
SHINKA disputed the pace inside of a foe in the two path around the first turn, settled back when MISS ATHLETIC cleared off down the backstretch, re-bid
two wide around the far turn, took over near the quarter pole and dug in late to repel challengers. WONDERFULVENEZUELA tracked the pace two wide,
advanced three wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner in midstretch but could never get past. LUNETTA JAK steadied entering the first turn,
raced two wide in traffic through the opening five furlongs, angled three wide nearing the five-sixteenths marker, tipped four wide in upper stretch and rallied
through the lane. BROKEN BANKER saved ground in range, tipped two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. MISS ATHLETIC vied in the
three path around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, set the pace along the rail around the far turn and gave way near the quarter pole. LADY
BONHEUR steadied into the first turn, bumped while racing three wide around that bend, angled in for the far turn and never threatened. SANDY BULLET
was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide, was bumped midway around the first turn and retreated three wide around the far turn. FROSTED
QUEEN was bumped at the start, steadied repeatedly while racing erratically early and was through after a half.
