Footnotes
EUROSTORM vied inside of an outer prompter, drew clear of that one entering the lane and was driven home. EMILYHASHERTURN chased the embattled
leading pair from the three to path, altered course outside of a lugging rival leaving the three sixteenths pole and ran on to edge place from that one inside
the final sixteenth. BETONYA vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner, failed to keep pace with that one entering the lane in the three path, drifted
inwardly and across a rival's path at the three sixteenths pole, tired and lost place to that one in the late stages. STEAL ME OVER laid off of the pace in the
three to four path, shifted inwardly rather than tipping out for clear sailing entering the late, then moved out to split foes nearing midstretch and improved
position. TRUTHRDAAR broke a step slow and was bumped by an outer rival at the start, pursued from midpack along the inside and gave way. OUR
INDIAN GIRL tracked from the three path, tipped to the four path entering the lane, but lacked a rally before getting herded outwardly and outmoved by an
inner rival nearing midstretch, then made little impact. FLASH IT WIDE OPEN leaned inwardly and bumped a foe at the start, then was outrun along the
inside.

Footnotes
DEBS PRAYER showed the way inside of a pair of prompters around the far turn, sparred with a single outer dueler around the far turn, shook clear of that
one and held from a late challenger. FITTS N STARTS tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, sustained a grinding charge
in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong but needed more. WAR TOURIST prompted three to two wide, dueled around the far turn, but yielded
between horses nearing midstretch then lasted for show. OAK HILL SENIORITA saved ground off of the pace, offered a rail grind through the lane but was
kept at bay for show. SCARLET STORM laid off of the pace in the three to four path and between horses, took closer order approaching the far turn before
chased the top pair from within striking range in the three path around that bend, but was floated back four wide entering the lane and gave way. SUM
CHARM laid off of the pace in the four to five path, trailed before tucking to the two path approaching the fa turn and made litlle impact. NICE LIKE
MICHELLE prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain position with five furlongs to go and steadily faded.

HOORAY AUSTIN broke a step slow, settled off of the pace in the two to three path, moved between horses turning for home, tipped out to the five path in
upper stretch, rallied to bid offer a bid inside the final sixteenth and edged past late. CHANNEL WON stalked three wide, offered a bid in midstretch, but
flopped back to his left lead while doing so, vied multiple paths outside of his inner counterpart into the final sixteenth, but was outkicked by an outer bidder
approaching the wire. TOUGH CHARLIE set the pace inside of a prompting rival, disposed of that one before meeting a wider challenge at the furlong
grounds, dug in gamely to deep stretch but was bested late. PESO IN MY POCKET trailed along the inside, advanced between horses in upper stretch and
willingly chased the leaders through the late stages. SEVEN SCENTS broke a step slow while last away, lacked speed hung in the five to six path and
moved up. ROBO laid off of the pace in the four to five path, but delayed a lead change through upper stretch and lacked a bid. ALICIA'S KID prompted two
wide, vied around the turn, but yielded before fading between horses in midstretch. FIREINTHESTORM chased along the inside and faded.

Footnotes
DESSERT FIRST brushed with an outer rival upon leaving the gates, chased along the inside, claimed place from outer chasing counterparts while taking
aim outside of the leader in upper stretch, ranged up to offer a late bid along with an outer foe in the closing stages and prevailed between horses.
DREAMING ALWAYS laid off of the pace in the two to three path, swung five wide entering the lane, rallied to offer a bid approaching the wire but missed.
MAHOMEBRED bumped an outer rival at the start, sped clear soon after, showed the way in the two path, held sway to the sixteenth pole but was caught
by an outer pair in the closing stages. PURRFECT MOON raced forward in the four path and outside of a pair of rivals, but hung on her left lead while
chasing through upper stretch and yielded between horses entering the final furlong. SECRET MELODY brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked in
the three path and between a pair of foes around the turn, then gave way. HEY MADALYN CLAIRE chased from off of the pace in the four path and
weakened. LASSAROCK lacked speed along the inside and made little impact. BRIGHTNMORNINGSTAR was bumped by an inner rival at the start, trailed
in the three path, fanned to the six path entering upper stretch but hung on her left lead and was outrun.

Footnotes
CAROOM saved ground well back, picked up stride moving two to three wide and between horses entering the lane, split foes at the three sixteenths pole to
surge to the fore and kicked away with good energy. ROCKSTAR RED was allowed to settle, bumped an outer rival moving to the three to four path into the
first turn, gained in the five path around the far turn before drifting to the six path entering the lane, then sustained progress to gain place passing the furlong
grounds and chased the leader home. BOLT FROM ABOVE pursued from midpack in the three path, advanced between horses around the far turn, tipped
to the four path entering the lane before offering a bid for the lead at the three sixteenths pole, but was outkicked by an inner rival leaving that station, lost
place to an outer foe passing the furlong pole and held show. RIGHTHERE RIGHTNOW was bumped by an inner rival into the far turn before settling well
back in the four path, trailed in the three path into the far turn, shifted out to the six path before moving up between horses in midstretch and ran on for a
minor share. SAGITTARIUS showed the way along the inside, got headed by outer bidders at the three sixteenths pole and faded. PAPA JOJO tracked in
the two to three path early on, but faded in the four path and between horses around the far turn. NOW IMA BELIEVER pursued from midpack along the
inside, chased entering the lane and gave way. ANGER RISING stalked two wide, pressed turning for home, but faltered between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
JEFFROW trailed along the inside, advanced past outer rivals around the far turn, took aim two wide and between horses leaving the quarter pole, bid
inside of the leader in midstretch and edged past entering the final sixteenth. CITY OF LOVE vied two wide, led into the lane but was bested by an inner
bidder in the final furlong. COMMANDER SCOTT laid close up along the inside before steadying under strong restraint while up on the leader's heels exiting
the first turn, settled into stalking stride shortly after, pursued before fanning to the four path to take aim entering the lane, but only managed to chase the
top pair into the final furlong and was best of the rest. CAJUN CRAZY laid off of the pace in the three path, chased from midpack in the four path around the
far turn, floated to the six path entering the lane and surpassed inner tiring rivals. COURTMAN tracked to three wide and between horses, pressed the top
pair into the far turn, but floated to the five path entering the lane and gave way. ANDERS SMILE stuttered a step at the start, vied along the inside and
weakened in upper stretch. GO BROTHER GO bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked in the four path and between horses, then faded into the far
turn. ANGELIC KNIGHT bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked five wide and was through early.

Footnotes
BERLAINE pressed in the four path, bid entering the lane and drew off entering midstretch. MONEY WORKS bumped with an outer rival at the start,
pursued from midpack along the inside, shifted to the three to four path in upper stretch and ran on to gain place at the sixteenth pole. CLEARLY COPPER
trailed two wide, moved out of last in the three path around the far turn before shifting to the six path into upper stretch and stayed on belatedly. A LIL

furlong and lost show late. ELODINE laid off of the pace along the inside, advanced between horses in midstretch and ran on mildly. CONTROLLED
TEMPER bumped with an inner rival at the start and failed to factor from the three path. NOT TONIGHT JOE brushed with an outer rival at the start,
pursued from midpack in the three path and between horses, floated to the five path in upper stretch and lacked a bid among foes. OH MACARENA stalked
two wide and between horses, but chased around the far turn and faded through the final furlong. SIGNING laid close up along the inside, steadied briefly at

Footnotes
STARPORT rushed forward to duel for the lead with an outer rival through a hard pace around the turn, drew clear of that one in upper stretch, weakened
late yet lasted to the wire. VERO CAMPIONE lacked speed in the four path, picked up stride before altering to the six path in midstretch, then continued his
rally to offer a late bid but came up short. JOSAN trailed in the two path, swung out to the eight path in midstretch and rallied belatedly. TWOFEXUSNEXUS
tracked in the two path, claimed place from outer rivals at the furlong grounds, but yielded thereafter. COLT'S BRIM saved ground off of the pace, offered a
rail grind but flattened out a sixteenth from home. CALIBRACHOAMATTERS dueled for the lead with an inner rival while setting a hot pace around the turn,
then weakened in upper stretch. COUNTRY GUY chased from midpack in the three to four path, entered the lane in the six path and failed to menace.
SHAWN'S SOLVING stalked closest to the top pair and from the four path around the turn, but faded in upper stretch.
