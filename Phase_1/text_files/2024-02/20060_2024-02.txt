Footnotes
FREEFORM set the pace inside of a pair of pressers, drew clear of them around the far turn, held sway until tiring in the final sixteenth, encountered a late
challenge from an outer bidder but lasted to the wire. REQUESTFORPROPOSAL tracked the leading trio from the three to four path, gained place in pursuit
of the clear leader turning for home, ran on ad closed in as that one tired in the late stages, attempted to reel him in at the wire but came up short.
LUMINOUS RULER saved ground towards the rear, then slipped through a rail seam to bid for show entering the lane before edging that position at the
furlong grounds. MRS. SPEAKER prompted the pace two wide and between horses, chased the clearing leader around the far turn and faded. SEARCH
stalked four to three wide and outside of foes around the first turn, pressed entering the backstretch, but chased the clearing leader around the far turn and
weakened. GRAY PEARL lacked speed two wide, trailed in the five path around the far turn and made little impact.

NICELY UNIFIED vied for the lead with an outer rival while remaining a path off of the inside, drew clear of that one approaching the quarter pole and held
sway under a drive. CAROLINA JACY raced off of the pace in the three to four path, advanced outside of rivals around the far turn and gained place
entering the final furlong. FIST CITY stalked the top pair from the three to four path, chased them while giving way in the three path around the far turn,
tucked to the inside approaching the lane and kept on to reclaim show passing the furlong grounds. GIANT TUDE laid off of the pace in the two to three path
and failed to menace. HOT GOLDEN GIRL vied for the lead outside of the eventual winner and in the three path, but failed to keep pace turning for home
and faded between horses. AURORA AUSTRALIS tracked in the two path, but gave way behind a fading foe around the far turn. MY SUGAR FIX saved
ground off of the pace but made little impact. JAZZ JAZZ JAZZ trailed in the four path around the first turn, then was eased around the far turn, pulled up
entering the lane and got vanned off.

Footnotes
SONYA KNOWS BETTER showed the way inside of an outer pressure, shook free of that one in hand turning for home, drew off entering the lane and
widened under a drive. SLICK AND FAST vied three to two wide and outside of the eventual winner around the first turn, sustained pressure coming under
urging in the three path around the far turn, but proved no match for the leader entering the lane and held place. MARVINS' POSSE stalked four to three
wide early on, chased the top pair floating from the four to five path around the far turn, lost show to an inner bidder at the furlong grounds yet ran on to
reclaim that position in the late stages. CATCHIN DRAMA broke a step slow at the start, trailed in the two path, advanced in the four path around the far
turn, tucked two wide entering the lane, gained show from an outer rival while shifting out at the furlong grounds, but flattened out in the final sixteenth
before his rider stood early. GO BROTHER GO broke a step slow, laid off of the pace in the four path, then the six path around the far turn and moved up
willingly. CAJUN CRAZY tracked three to four wide early on, but chased in the five to six path around the far turn and failed to menace. RICKY RIGHT
pursued from midpack along the inside, paused behind rivals nearing the lane, shifted three wide entering it and failed to threaten. SNAKEBIT laid off of the
pace in the three path and failed to factor. SINGLE SHOT stalked along the inside, chased around the far turn then was eased through the late stages.
VIKING LEGACY pursued from midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened around the far turn then was eased awkwardly in the final sixteenth.
OLE STUD MUFFIN was outrun along the inside, then pulled up reaching the furlong grounds and was vanned off.

Footnotes
SHE HAS IT ALL dueled for the lead two wide, cleared her inner counterpart before shifting inwardly in upper stretch, braced for that one's re-challenge in
the final furlong and held. POT'S PAYCHECK dueled for the lead with an outer rival, failed to keep pace with that one leaving the quarter pole shifted out
while sustaining stride to re-take aim from the outside nearing midstretch, offered a re-bid in the final furlong but needed more to re-gain even terms. RED
WHISTLE was bumped and knocked off stride by an outer rival at the start, trailed in the four to five path around the turn, fanned out to the seven path in
upper stretch, stayed on to spark a duel for show entering the final sixteenth and prevailed. BROADWAY STAR lacked speed along the inside, shifted
outside of rivals turning for home, improved to reach show entering the lane in the five path, ran on to close in on the top pair as an outer rival bid for show
in the final furlong, sparred with that one through the late stages but was nailed for show at the wire. DELIGHTFUL HALO laid off of the pace three wide and
faded. ADIAMONDINTHESTORM chased along the inside and weakened. IMMA MADI TUE chased two wide and between horses around the turn, then
weakened.

Footnotes
DEVIL'S HARVEST showed the way in the two path, built a clear margin around the far turn, maintained that advantage through midstretch then held from a
late challenger. CLARESTOWN trailed in the three two path, picked up stride swinging five wide at the five sixteenths pole, rallied while shifting inwardly in
upper stretch, gained place from an inner pair entering the final furlong, sustained progress to offer a late bid but ran out of ground. TREATY brushed an
inner rival and took back from between horses at the start, settled off of the pace along the inside, shifted to the three path entering the backstretch, tucked
back inside to progress saving ground around the far turn, dedicated to a rail charge after pausing briefly in upper stretch, but lacked the needed rail punch
to offer a bid, got outkicked for place entering the final furlong and held show. JUST BATTLE stalked forwardly along the inside, got rank behind rivals in the
two path around the first turn, steadied nearing the backstretch, settled into stride before gaining place with three furlongs to go, chased the clear leader two
wide entering the lane, got outkicked by an outer foe in midstretch and lacked a bid. BUTLER CABIN broke outwardly, tracked from the three to four path,
chased around the far turn and yielded. TEMPLE CITY RUN was a bit restless in the starting gate awaiting the start, laid off of the pace along the inside and
made little impact. ACTION SEEKER was briefly antsy in the starting gate, then took light contact from an outer rival at the start, pressed the leader from the
three path, but weakened between horses with three furlongs to go.

NAUGHTY LOTTIE tracked from the two to three path around the turn, bid outside of the new leader entering the lane assumed command in upper stretch
and kicked away with good energy. BALI DREAMIN stalked the early leader from the two path while inside of a rival, moved to press outside of the leader
entering the turn, bid and forged an advantage passing the five sixteenths pole, led into the lane as an outer rival offered a menacing bid, got overpowered
by that one in upper stretch, proved no match and held place. MISS TULSA broke a step slow, lacked speed two wide, moved forward between horses
turning for home, advanced among foes in upper stretch and sustained progress to claim show from an outer rival at the wire. ONEROLLOFTHEDICE was
bumped between horses and put to crowded quarters among foes at the start, pursued the main group from the two path, gained show from between horses
shifting to the four path in upper stretch, chased the top pair into the final furlong and was nailed by an inner bidder for show. YOLANDA WHO stalked
forwardly three wide into the turn, but chased the leaders from the four path around the bend before drifting to the five path entering the lane and gave way.
SALLY'S SUPRISE bumped with an outer rival before taking contact from an inner foe and being squeezed between horses at the start, raced off of the
pace along the inside, got outmoved by an outer rival entering the lane and failed to factor. TAKE CHARGE WOMAN chased from midpack in the four path
into the turn and failed to menace. BREWHOUSE was forced outwardly by an inner rival, bumped an outer foe, got pinched and steadied back at the start,
trailed three wide and made little impact. SHELLBY broke outwardly causing trouble for outer rivals, set the pace along the inside before an outer rival
applied pressure into the turn, got headed by that one at the five sixteenths pole and caved.

Footnotes
DREWMANIA tracked along the inside, pursued under snug hold behind foes before steadying off rivals' heels into the turn, recovered and advanced inside
of rivals turning for home, sustained progress to slip inside of the leader and offer a bid at the furlong grounds, cleared entering the final sixteenth and held
firm from a late challenger. COMMITTEE OF ONE brushed with an outer rival at the start, settled off of the pace in the two path, moved out to the four to five
path in midstretch, surged late to offer a bid outside of the new leader in the closing stages, but was denied. SCAT FREE broke outwardly and was last
away, rushed forward to speed clear in the opening quarter mile, took the turn in the two path, held an advantage through upper stretch, but was headed by
an inner bidder leaving the furlong grounds, yielded to an outer challenger in the final sixteenth and saved show. WORKS FOR ME brushed an inner foe at
the start, tracked four to three wide around the turn, pursued from within striking range in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival nearing the
furlong grounds, then was surpassed by an outer foe in the final furlong, then ran on to miss reaching show. GABARRA stalked in the two path, chased
between horses nearing the lane, kept on in slightly crowded quarters among foes to also miss show at the wire. SPONGE BATH leaned out at the start,
trailed tucking to the three path into the turn, floated out to the six to seven path entering the lane and made little impact. CLASSIC POWER (IRE) chased
forwardly in the three path and between horses into the turn, but faded with five sixteenths to go.

Footnotes
CONTROLLED TEMPER tracked in the three path, ranged up in the six path to bid outside of the top pair entering the lane, took charge in upper stretch and
drew off while geared down through the final furlong. MAYLEN laid off of the pace in the three path, then ran on between horses to claim place at the
sixteenth pole. WEC KEAH dueled for the lead two wide, got floated to the five path entering the lane before being outkicked by an outer rival in upper
stretch, chased but lost place entering the final sixteenth. HARD EXIT broke out and was corrected by steadying at the start, lacked speed in the two to
three path and moved up. JILLY'S WEST broke outwardly and bumped two rivals while knocking his own hind end out from underneath him at the start,
dueled for the lead inside of a foe, drifted to the four path entering the lane and weakened in upper stretch. KEEPEM SAFE was bumped by an inner rival at
the start, chased along the inside and faded. JOCELYN saved ground well back, but to no avail. SWEET MARIN broke a step slow before being bumped by
an inner rival at the start causing his rider to temporarily lose his irons , trailed along the inside around the turn and was outrun. TOOTOO TOURIST laid off
of the pace in the four path and tired.
