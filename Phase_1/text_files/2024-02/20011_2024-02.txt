MY FAVORITE SONG chased the early pace while three wide into the turn, rallied in upper stretch and was in a strong drive then held sway in the end.
VALDINA DREAMS was allowed to settled then rallied on the turn, was four wide in the stretch, gaining ground willingly but was too late. SPARRA was
inside on the turn saving ground, was blocked behind a wall of horses in upper stretch then split rivals in late stretch to make a late gain. RICHARD'S TX
BLING was unhurried early then rallied on the turn, was five wide and closed ground willingly in late stretch. HOLIDAY RUN set a pressured pace while
inside, was in a long drive in the stretch but weakened in late stretch. DOC'S BOLERO pressed the pace while two wide into the turn, was hard used on the
turn then gave way in the stretch drive. JUST HANGIN RIDGE was unhurried early and no threat. GOLD CAPO was through early then gave way.
