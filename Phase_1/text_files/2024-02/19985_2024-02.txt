Footnotes
MY FRIEND LOUIE off rail run to front, stayed on to stretch, bore in eighth pole bothered rival, dug in gamely and held on. COTE D'IVOIRE wide run first
turn, good position to far turn with a late bid. HASKELLED pressed pace inside to stretch, in tight at the eighth pole with no room and bumped late. TIGER
PAW (IRE) pressed pace between horses to far turn, nothing left stretch. BREAKOUT STAR off rail run three wide to far turn with nothing left in stretch.
SAILOR'S CHANCE three wide run first turn while never a real factor throughout. SOCIAL HISTORY bit tardy start angled in, saved ground to no avail.
DEVELOPING THE WAY never factored throughout while always back. AFTER A RIDERS OBJECTION INTO THE STRETCH RUN, MY FRIEND LOUIE
WAS DISQAULIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD FOR INTERFERIENCE AT THE EIGHTH POLE WHICH CAUSED HASKELLED TO CHECK
UP AND PLACED THIRD.

nod. ELECTROSTATIC inside run to chase, stayed to far turn but evened out for show spot. GUNLEATHER AL raced widest into first turn, unhurried to far
turn with no late kick in the stretch run. LIAM THE BRAVE was antsy in gate, reared at the start and lost best chance no factor throughout. PERFECT
PAINTING never factored throughout. P K WOOD pressed pace between horses to the half, gave in readily. MR. PETERKIN never a menace throughout.
GHOST BIKE tried to keep up for a half with nothing left and gave in readily.
