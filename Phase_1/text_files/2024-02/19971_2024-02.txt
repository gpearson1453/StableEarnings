WICKED STREET dueled for the lead to the outside of a rival, then made a three wide bid in the lane and was up late in between rivals to prevail under a
drive. BAHAMA PEARL chased the early pace, inside on the turn and swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid in the lane but hung late to just
miss. CINQUE AMORE dueled for the lead on the inside and made a bid to gain a short lead by the furlong marker but was caught late. PARISIAN VIBE
was settled on the turn two wide, then closed well up the inside but was too late. DAILY BRIEFING was settled back early, three to four wide on the turn and
then had a late rally. FRANKLY MY DEAR was allowed to settle early and lacked a serious rally. BRYCE'S PHILLY failed to menace.

Footnotes
EDDIE FELSON stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid in hand on the turn to take over and was clear by the quarter pole, then drew off under
mild left handed crop urging to prove much the best. MAGIC PATH tracked the pace from the inside, eased out on the turn and came three wide into the
lane, angled out by the furlong marker and rallied well for the place award while no match for the winner. FINAL OPPORTUNITY vied for the lead two wide
and then faded in the drive, lost the place award late while besting the rest. EAST AURORA chased the early pace, then was between rivals on the far turn
and came four wide off the turn and weakened. AURORA KUMA vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. PRETORIAN GOLD was bumped and off a
step slow, then chased the pace from the outside and tired after six furlongs. SUGAR'S LAST HOPE was six wide into the first turn and then was not a
threat. CHANNEL KING was off slowly and failed to respond.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT WONDER set the early pace and drew out on the turn and came three wide off the turn and drew off in the lane to prove much the best while
being kept to task. BAHITI chased the pace four wide, then was three wide off the turn and proved to be no match for the winner while clearly second best.
RILEY G was off a step slow, split rivals by the five sixteenth and then came four wide off the turn and had a belated rally to gain the show award.
CONCEPTUALIZE stalked the winner three wide early, then chased that rival two wide by the quarter pole and weakened, bested rest. SENSIBLE
MARRIAGE passed the tiring rivals. CAST YOUR NET chased the pace three wide and weakened. KEEP IT SEXY tracked the early pace on the inside and
then was empty. NO COMMON CENT was settled early and saved ground on the turn to no avail. CHERISHED WISH was settled early and was on the
outside on the turn and tired.

TEXAS TANGIE was bumped at the start, went up to set the pace on the inside, was well handled and remained clear by the furlong marker and then was
kept to crop urging to prove best. NAIL POLISH prompted the winner three wide and then fought on to the wire but could not gain while being second best.
LEVISA stalked the early pace, dropped to the inside on the turn but lacked the needed winning bid, bested rest. LOVELY LIZA chased the pace on the
inside and then shifted out leaving the quarter pole and came four wide off the turn but had no kick. KAZ MUSIC was settled back early, four wide on the
turn, came six wide off the turn and had a belated rally. FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD was bumped at the start, settled early and lacked a rally. HIDDEN CACHE
showed brief speed and then fell back and settled between rivals on the turn and had no rally. PEACE OUT broke in at the start, then made a inside run and
cut the corner leaving the turn but flattened out. ROSES ARE FREE tracked the pace four wide and then was empty.

HOUGHTON SHUFFLE stalked the pace on the outside, four wide on the turn and made a five wide bid off the turn and drove clear and then final sixteenth
to prove best under a drive. MAGIC SPIN pressed the pace three wide and made a four wide bid off the turn to vie for the lead in between rivals by the
furlong marker and then could not go with the winner late while gamely getting the place nod. DARK TIMBER was away alertly to get towards the inside to
set a pressured pace, then dueled for the lead by the quarter pole, then dug in gamely in the lane but was out-kicked for the place award. TOWN'S
WARRIOR stalked the early pace from between rivals, three to two wide on the tur n, angled in leaving the turn to loom boldly on the inside by the furlong
marker but had no late kick. FIELDSTONE rushed up the inside to track the pace, steadied by the seven sixteenths and then weakened in the drive. MEAN
MACHINE was taken back early, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
LOST IN NEWYORK dueled for the early lead three wide, made a bid to shake clear on the turn while in the two path, then was given a few pops right
handed with the crop and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best. KEEPING IT COUNTRY chased the early pace, four wide on the turn and then
came five wide off the turn and was up to be second best while no match for the winner. JUMPMASTER stalked the early pace on the outside, made a three
wide bid on the turn bur weakened in the drive. PYLON showed brief speed two wide early and then dropped back, weakened. SUTTON BREEZE dueled
for the early lead on the inside and weakened.
