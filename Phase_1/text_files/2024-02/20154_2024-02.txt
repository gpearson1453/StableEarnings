Footnotes
GROVE ST. got bumped at the start by an outer foe into an inner foe, rated in the four path, was cued early into the turn, made a sweeping bid in the five
path turning into the lane, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and inched clear. TAKING IT ALL stalked in the two path, brushed with an outer foe while
just off the rail midway around the turn, was roused passing the quarter, bid in the two path at the top of the lane, and ran on for place. RED HOT SPARK
prompted the pace in the three path, came under a ride early into the turn, brushed with an inner foe while in the two path midway around the turn, and
evened out from the three path in the final furlong to show. BINGO'S DREAM got sent from the gate to set the pace in the two path, was coaxed along the
inside midway around the turn, but faded in the stretch. JAZZIN chased in the four path, was coaxed along from the two path rounding the turn, but flattened
in the four path down the stretch. SANDY BULLET bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced off the pace in the two path and did not factor. MISS G
MONEY broke in and bumped an inner foe, raced wellback in the four path and never threatened from out in the seven path in the stretch. WHATS UP
BUTTERCUP trailed in the two path early and was no menace.

CARRINGTON set the pace in the two path and widened under a drive in the lane. PARALLEL raced off the pace two wide between foes, checked around
the first turn, steadied several more times in the opening half-mile, went three wide between foes around the far turn, angled further out in upper stretch and
ran on for the place. VIBRANT LADY raced up close four wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner in the lane and just missed
second. FLORIBUNDA stalked the pace inside and weakened in the lane. VINO FOR THE QUEEN failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
CITRUS BELLE saved ground off the pace, briefly angled three wide late on the far turn, angled back in in upper stretch and never threatened. COOL
TRICKS broke outwardly and bumped at the start, pressed the pace in the three path and faded in the lane. SOME OF IT was bumped between foes at the
start, raced four wide and made little impact. DARLING DARLEY was outrun inside. VINE GROVE was bumped at the start and never reached contention

Footnotes
AMERICAN RETRO chased in the two path, was stymied passing the quarter, tipped out to the four path at the top of the stretch and rallied to be up in the
closing stages. HOLA GATA trailed from the three path into the backstretch, was roused while angling out to the nine path turning into the lane, and was
surging late to place. DEMOGORGON showed the way around the first turn to set the pace along the inside down the backstretch, opened up under a
nudge around the far turn, kept on from the two path into the stretch, but was caught by an outer pair late to show. GRACE DARLING (IRE) laid in midpack
in the four path, swung out to the eight path under a drive turning into stretch, and stayed on. FIVE TOWNS (GB) laid wellback in the three path, tipped out
to the five path turning into the lane, and improved. TYPEY raced off the pace in the two path, had to fan widest turning into the stretch, and made no
impact. WRIGHT UP FRONT stalked inside but faded in the stretch. ROYAL DAME rated in the four path, had to angled out to the ten path to get clear at
the top of the lane, but did not factor. BOSTON ROSE (IRE) tracked in the three path but weakened from the six path in the stretch. LADY EMILY
KATHRYN was held up along the inside early but never menaced. AROUND THE SUN prompted the pace in the three path, but gaveway in the stretch.

Footnotes
SWEET DANI GIRL tracked the pace two wide around the first turn, edged closer three deep rounding the far turn, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and
held safe late. PAPILIO (IRE) raced two and three wide in midpack, angled four wide near the quarter pole and rallied between foes in the lane. CHARMED
WAY raced off the pace two wide, steadied near the three-eighths pole, swung five wide near the quarter pole and rallied widest. OCEAN CLUB was hard
held inside, tipped out in upper stretch and kept on while lacking a clear path in the lane. MARKSMAN QUEEN (GB) pressed the pace two wide, dueled two
wide around the far turn, led past the eighth pole and was outfinished. GLORIA'S PRINCESS set the pace along the rail, dueled inside to the sixteenth pole
and weakened a bit late. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) saved ground in range, angled out in upper stretch and rallied belatedly between foes. RIDING PRETTY
saved ground and failed to menace. LADY ARSINOE played no factor while racing three and four wide. BATUCADA was rank early, raced two and three
wide and made little impact.

Footnotes
RUN CLASSIC rated in the two path, was roused into the turn, angled out to the six path turning into the stretch, and rallied past an inner duo to win going
away. CANDY MAN ROCKET tracked in the five path, ranged up to bid in the four path turning into the lane, led passing the eighth pole, but was quickly
overtaken by an outer foe to place. LOCO ABARRIO stalked inside, bumped an outer foe while shifting out to the four path at the top of the stretch, and kept
on for show. LONG RANGE TODDY vied for the lead inside, stuck his head in front rounding the turn, but faded in the final furlong. DEAN DELIVERS
prompted the pace in the four path, bumped with an inner foe and was in the five path at the top of the lane, but weakened. HURRICANE J dueled for the
lead in the three path but yielded in the stretch. IRONSTONE bobbled and bumped at the start with an outer foe, raced off the pace in the four path and
never threatened. SWIRVIN bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased between foes in the three path but backed up around the turn. SCARAMOUCHE
raced wellback in the six path and never menanaced.

Footnotes
SET set the pace along the rail, drew off readily in upper stretch, drifted out slightly in the final sixteenth and widened under mild urging. TYPHOON FURY
stalked the winner three wide, could not match strides with that foe in upper stretch but stayed on for the place. BOURBON OUTLAW saved ground off the
pace, swung four wide in upper stretch and was along for the show in the final strides. LIAM'S JOURNEY raced up close inside early, edged closer two wide
around the far turn and weakened in the lane. MO' SPRESSO bumped with MO CALIENTE not long after the start, steadied entering the first turn, saved
ground in range and lacked a closing bid. RIVERWALK raced off the early pace four wide, saved ground around the far turn and never threatened. AIR
INVASION chased the pace two wide around the first turn then steadily faded. ZEKE'S HEART raced three wide in midpack and faded after a half. MO
CALIENTE was bumped at the start, checked late on the first turn, raced two and three wide and never menaced. BANDOOLA played no factor while racing
three and four wide. OCONEE LIFE was outrun while racing four and five wide. DANCINGINTHESTORM failed to menace while racing three and four wide.
