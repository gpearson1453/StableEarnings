ONLY GIRL raced off the rail, off the pace, moved up inside on the turn, rallied on the rail in the stretch run, dueled with MISS HOPPERTUNITY, dug in
gamely inside of that rival and edged away late. MISS HOPPERTUNITY tracked on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied between rivals at the furlong
marker, dug in gamely outside of the winner and came up second best. YELOMA set the pace racing with a clear lead, drifted out at the top of the lane,
dueled outside rivals and then weakened. WOKE UP A DIVA raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. THREE CUPS FULL raced
two wide off the pace, chased on the turn, lacked a rally and tired. OVERTHEBLUESKY was outrun.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT set the pace racing two wide on the first turn, dropped over to the rail and took charge leaving the clubhouse turn, opened up the
lead, widened on the far turn, responded to some mild urging at the eighth pole, then was ridden out. FLASHNDYNAMITE stalked close up two wide early
on, settled off the leader, chased that rival on the far turn, dug in through the stretch and held for the place spot. KENTUCKY PRIDE raced three wide off the
pace, chased outside on the far turn and gained mildly on the rail in the stretch. JUST STAY HOME trailed the field, came three wide into the lane and
gained mildly outside. CAGED PIXIE raced two wide off the pace, chased inside on the far turn and tired. WONDER CITY raced close up early on the rail,
tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and faded.

JAA MODE stalked the pace outside, bid midway on the final turn then held rival safe late in a determined score. THE KING CHEEK sprinted to a clear lead
inside, steadied near the top of the lane, angled out and came again. DEPLANE saved ground close up, bid on the final turn then weakened late. JARDANI
lacked speed along the inside then narrowed the gap while no threat. ROAN MOUNTAIN dropped well behind in the two path and lacked a solid rally.
CATCH THE SMOKE raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter, vied through the final turn then faded. KINGSVILLE raced wide off the leaders and
weakened steadily.
