Footnotes
JACKSON'S WEBB stalked in the four path, bid in the three path passing the quarter, took the lead while floating out to the six path turning into the lane,
opened up slightly passing the eighth pole, and held sway. AWESOME FIRST chased in the three path, swung out to the five path under right handed
urging turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. BACK TO REALITY tracked in the five path, was cued in the four path midway around the turn, drifted
out to the eight path in upper stretch, and kept on for show. KOHAKU was hustled along while in range from the two path, ridden along the inside around the
turn, but flattened. TAPIT'S DIRECTION steadied at the start, raced wellback in the six path, was coaxed along in the four path around the turn, fanned out
to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but made no impact. PERSONAL DRAMA set the pace in the three path, was nudged along in the two path around
the turn, but gaveway turning into the stretch. HANDSOME RUNNER trailed throughout.

Footnotes
WHATTA WORLD pressed the pace two wide, reached even terms leaving the the eighth pole, dueled outside of BONMATI from there, bumped lighlty with
that foe late and prevailed. BONMATI set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of the winner through the final furlong, lightly bumped with that foe in deep
stretch and just missed. MEXICAN SUGAR saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn and rallied for the show. CHANNEL LOOP
raced off the pace two wide, angled four wide in midstretch and lacked the needed rally. FIORENZA raced up close inside and weakened in the lane. FREE
CHARGING chased the pace two and three wide and faded in the drive. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BONMATI AGAINST THE WINNER
FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
SWISS SLANG had to steady early into the first turn, tracked in the two path, waited patiently for room around the far turn, tipped out to the four path
passing the eighth pole, and rallied past an inner foe to draw clear. DONTBESOOGROUCHY trailed in the two path, coaxed along the inside early into the
far turn, fanned out to the seven path turning into the lane, and ran on for place. IKE'S GAMBLE set the pace in the two path, was cued along the inside
midway around the far turn, floated out to the three path turning into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong to show. DIAMOND MESSA stalked in the four
path, tipped out to the six path under a ride turning into the stretch, but flattened. K CROWN prompted the pace in the three path, bid around the far turn,
but weakened on his left lead from the five path down the lane. NOBLE WAVE rated in the three path but was no menace.

Footnotes
REEF RUNNER raced in range two wide, tipped three wide nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over near the sixteenth pole
and held safe. VALIANT FORCE saved ground off the pace, steadied entering the turn, tipped two wide not longer after, swung five wide turning for home
and rallied widest. ESPERON set the pace along the rail, drifted out under left-handed urging in the lane, straightened out under hand urging and yielded
near the sixteenth pole. MACKVILLE bumped with BANNEKER not long after the start, raced off the pace three wide, swung six wide turning for home and
had only a mild rally. BANNEKER was bumped after the start, saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and never threatened. KING JULIEN
tracked the pace two wide and faded in the drive. HIBERNACLE prompted the pace two wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ A TALE stalked inside, was cued passing the three-eighths, tipped out to the four path turning into the stretch, and kicked on to draw past the inner
pacesetter in the final sixteenth. GEPARD got fractious in the gate, set the pace in the two path, was confidently handled while just off the rail around the
turn, received right handed cues while opening up in the two path in upper stretch, but was caught in the final sixteenth by an inner foe to place.
SWAGGISH bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked in the three path, was ridden into the turn, floated out to the seven path at the top of the stretch,
and kept on for show. WARLORD CRUZAN raced off the pace in the three path, swung from the five path into the stretch, angled inwards to the two path,
but made no impact. VILLEGAS SWING got fractious in the gate, then bumped with foes on both sides at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, but
faded on his left lead from the five path down the lane. ONE MORE SCORE bumped with an inner foe at the start, raced wellback along the inside, cut the
corner turning into the lane, but flattened. GONE NUTS bumped with an inner foe at the start, chased in the four path but was no menace from the eight
path in the stretch. ALLEN DIGGS bumped with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout from the five to seven paths.
