BROWN SUGA BABE settled off the early pace setters, made a good rail bid through the upper stretch as Late Nite Mistress was getting out and prevailed
late under strong handling. LATE NITE MISTRESS sprinted clear, kept a clear margin through the far turn, got out entering the upper stretch, lost
momentum, came back again and missed in a game effort. ESME chased the early leader, shifted out four wide into the lane and weakened a bit late.
OREO ANGEL was off slowly, saved ground and raced even with no final bid. SKY BUY dropped to the back of the pack early, raced near the inside near
the three sixteenths pole, angled five wide and never menaced. UNCONSCIOUS MIND was coaxed along three deep and faded.

GRAN ANDREWS rated in the early stages, made a strong three wide bid near the three sixteenths pole and finished well to draw off under strong pressure.
WALK AWAY JOE stalked the pace, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and finished second best. GOODLUCKCHUCK set a pressured pace along
the inside and weakened. POLAR WIND raced off the early pace, swung five wide into the upper stretch and closed in mildly. MASTER THIS void of early
speed, saved ground and never was a factor. HANALEI'S HOUDINI pressed the early leader from the outside and faded.

MISSIONARY was quick to begin from the inside, clear at the eighth pole and prevailed late under strong pressure. DE'S CASTLE pressed three deep early
and finished gamely to the wire to miss. BEAR'S ESTATE was hustled along, aim nearing the eighth pole four deep, couldn't get by the top pair in a willing
effort. PINNACLE REEF dropped back to race mid pack under strong pressure, had a three wide run and not enough. ROCKING TO HOME raced near the
rail and was even with no late gain. JEFFERSON SECURITY raced five wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. DEVIL'S CANYON dropped
back early and failed to respond.
