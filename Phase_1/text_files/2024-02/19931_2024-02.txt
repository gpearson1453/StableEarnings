burst clear into upper stretch, was given one pop of a left-handed crop inside the three-sixteenths, drew off under a hand-ride into the final furlong, remained
clear under a confident hand-ride into the final sixteenth, was roused again while shortening stride and having his lead diminish late and held. LAFITTE'S
FLEET dropped back under urging early, moved closer outside the five-eighths pole, went around the turn in the two path, angled out in upper stretch,
remained on his inside lead until near the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, gained on the winner into the final sixteenth and finished willingly
for the place. JUST CALL RAY was hustled from the gate then brushed with a foe, raced off the pace under urging, went three then four wide on the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive and also finished willingly while up for the show. COMMERCE COMET pressed the pace on the outside of the
leader, vied in the three path on the turn and tired. CANDY TYCOON brushed with an opponent after the start, showed speed on the outside, pressed then
chased the pace, dropped back in the four path on the turn and had nothing left.

five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the two path, responded well when given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the furlong marker then switched
to a left-handed crop, came out some around the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. TEMPERMENTAL was hustled from the gate,
established a good position just off the pace, was asked along the rail on the turn, moved to the two path late on that bend, spun three wide into the stretch,
pursued the winner in the drive and failed to reach that foe while second best. EROS'S GIRL bumped with a rival at the start, was coaxed along off the

ROCK THE WEEKEND six then five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide into the turn, briefly tucked to the two path before tipping
back out three wide placed to coaxing at the three-eighths, swung six wide into upper stretch, rallied outside to take command nearing the eighth pole, then
edged clear to the finish kept to task. MONTEBELLO chased three then two wide, came under coaxing along the inside at the three-eighths, spun just off
the inside into upper stretch, rallied along the rail and was briefly placed in tight when FACE ABARRIO came inwards a furlong out, then ran on willingly to
secure the place honors clear of the rest. ANTHRACITE chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper
stretch, improved position to procure the show honors. HATCH broke out at the start bumping DEVILS CAY, chased four then two wide coming under
coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, got overhauled inside that station and weakened in
the late stages. FACE ABARRIO broke outwards under hustling and bumped MIDNIGHT WORKER, advanced to take command just inside the six furlong
marker and showed the way in hand three paths off the rail, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat and relented a furlong out, then weakened through to the finish. MIDNIGHT WORKER got bumped at the start
by the aforementioned rival, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. DEVIL'S
CAY got bumped at the start by HATCH, chased five then three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went five wide at the head of the stretch, tired.

Footnotes
GOOD SKATE jostled with a foe early on the first turn, was rated on the inside, slipped through along the rail to make a bid with three furlongs to run, spun
five wide into upper stretch under pressure, responded well in the final furlong, led into the final sixteenth then moved clear under strong urging. LEADING
CONTENDER went three wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked near the nine-sixteenths, was urged in the three to four path on
the final turn, raced between horses from the three-eighths pole to the quarter-pole, came seven wide into upper stretch, led into the final furlong, lost the
advantage to the winner before the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while able to get the place. KUCHAR broke in and bumped with a rival, jostled with a
foe while in the two path early on the first turn, shifted four wide late on that bend, was rated just off the pace, made a bid in the four to five path on the far
turn, came eight wide into upper stretch and was out-kicked while able to get the show. IRON WORKS was shut-off at the start then checked sharply while
pinched back, spotted the front many lengths, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths
pole, went five wide on the far turn, came nine wide into the stretch then drifted to about the eleven path near the three-sixteenths and lacked the needed
kick. OPTIC WAY broke through the front of the gate prior to the start but remained in the stall, went to the front, showed the way in the two path, was
headed outside the three-eighths pole, spun six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
NINETEEN OYSTERS was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the outside, was urged along in the three path on the turn, gained the advantage
under a drive in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up outside the sixteenth-pole and drew away under steady urging. BARGAINING POWER went to the
front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner in upper stretch,
fought with that foe into the final furlong and proved no match while able to hold the place. BLUE PLATE SPECIAL was well placed just off the pace, chased
while moving from the two path to the four path on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while able to get the
show. ICE ROAD chased the pace, dropped back some near the five-eighths pole, went four then five wide on the turn and also lacked the needed
response. SCOTTO dropped back towards the rear, went three to four wide on the turn and failed to rally. OPPORTUNITY SET was well placed just off the
pace, chased inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path while under the crop and came up empty. DEPUTY CONNECT broke awkwardly then
bumped with a foe while off a step slow, was urged at the rear, raced inside to the two path on the turn, came three wide into the stretch and was no factor.
SORPRESO was bumped at the start then forced out while off a bit slow, raced off the pace under urging, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into
the stretch and failed to threaten. FULL COMPLEMENT bumped with a rival at the start while off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, moved up into the
middle of the field, saved ground on the turn and capitulated then was vanned off after the race. FLASHY ALEX acted-up at the start then came in and hit
the inside of the gate, was off slow and spotted the front several lengths, went four wide on the turn and never reached contention. VERY DEBONAIRE was
urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
LOVE LIKE CRAZY broke out at the start brushing JAY'S LOVE, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path
through the turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying through the final
furlong and was up in the last jumps to prevail. MAMBAGIGI showed the way in hand just off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in and was caught in the last
strides to the finish. AWESOME GLO chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild
kick. JAY'S LOVE got brushed at the start by the breaking outwards LOVE LIKE CRAZY, chased seven paths off the inside down the backstretch before
tucking to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled seven to eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to
the finish. ZHEN LOU coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, kept on to
the finish. WILD MAGIC broke inwards brushing the near side stall before being bumped by ALOTTA JAYS, who broke outwards and was away near the
rear of the field, chased three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and made some headway through to the wire. REZOOM coaxed from the gate, prompted the pace three to four paths off the inside down
the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, went five to six wide into upper stretch in retreat and tired in the drive. ALOTTA JAYS broke
out at the start bumping WILD MAGIC, chased three to four wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, angled seven to eight
wide into upper stretch and made no impact. MISS NYQUIST fractious in the gate prior to the start, got backed out and reloaded, chased two to three wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide at the head of the stretch and was unable to make an impact. LADY LAWRENCE coaxed from
the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, tipped out five to six wide into upper stretch and faltered.
