Footnotes
DUKE SKYWALKER bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, was sent to an early lead, expanded his margin while saving ground around the
turn and continued to draw off down the stretch. KING OF CHAOS trailed the field through the opening quarter, began a bid while racing in the two and
three path around the turn and chased the winner home, no match for that rival. SIDNEY'S BID raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the
backstretch, ran into traffic and steadied slightly approaching the three eighths pole, switched to the outside from there, entered the stretch in the four path
and kept on to the wire. POSEIDONS MYTH raced off the pace on the outside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path and was outkicked
from there. NOT A DANCE raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and finished evenly
while drifting in through the final furlong. CAJUN CRACKER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the leader through
the opening quarter of a mile, began to drop back while saving ground around the turn and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
WANDERING WEST raced in the three path around the first turn, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the turn from
the two path, swung out to the five path to began a bid approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear late. PRIVATE LAKE saved ground around the first
turn, pressed the pace on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the rail around the final turn and in upper stretch and was caught near the wire. ONE
EYED JACK led the way from the outside through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around the second bend and was caught in the lane but
kept on to the finish. IT'S FATE raced in the three path around the first turn, tracked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn
from the four path, dueled in upper stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth of a mile. LAUDERDALE raced in the two path around the first turn,
chased the leaders between horses up the backstretch, moved up to challenge while racing in the three path around the far turn and faded in the final
furlong. ZONIC trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path throughout and never factored.

WHAT A KNOCKOUT raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, kicked clear with a furlong to go and drew off to the wire. WICKED SAUCY
bumped with the horse to her inside at the start, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to
save ground around the far turn and could not go with the winner late, chasing that rival to the finish. PRETTY FLATTERING saved ground around the first
turn, stalked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch and around the second bend and finished evenly. PATH TO VICTORY raced in the three path
around the first turn, tracked the pace setters on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and was outkicked in the
stretch. JAMAICAN INVADER brushed with the horse to her outside at the break, settled off the pace in the two path through the opening half mile, began a
bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and flattened out in the lane. MS MAGGIE chased the leaders on the outside around the first turn and
up the backstretch, began to drop back from the two path coming around the far turn and faded from there. CASARENA HOTTIE veered out and bumped
with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, trailed the field from the two path through the opening half mile, offered a bid nearing the end of the
backstretch, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and tired further in the lane.

Footnotes
AZURE SKY saved ground while trailing the field through the opening quarter of a mile, continued up the backstretch on the inside, navigated the turn from
the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground quickly on the outside to pull clear late. ANGEL'S MAGIC showed the way while
saving ground around the first turn, opened up on the field racing up the backstretch and around the far turn, dueled in upper stretch and was caught near
the wire. SHIMMERING LEROID saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming
around the far turn, dueled in the lane and gave way late. SHIPWRECK saved ground early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the
inside, continued to save ground around the second bend and finished evenly. SIMMS trailed the field on the outside around the first turn and up the
backstretch, came around the far turn in the four path and gained ground in late stretch. TAPINTOYOURBEER raced in the two path around the first turn,
settled at the back of the pack on the outside from there, saved ground around the second bend and passed tiring horses in the lane. HAD RIGHT saved
ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and made no bid. REINER raced
off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the second bend in the two path and was empty in the stretch. PRETTY DUDE
raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and
tired further from there.

Footnotes
PRAIRIE HAWK raced in the two path around the first turn, tracked the leader well behind that rival up the backstretch, began a bid from the two and three
path coming around the far turn and kicked clear in the stretch. SUERTE raced in the three path through the opening quarter of a mile, settled in the middle
of the pack for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position while saving ground around the second bend, swung wider into the stretch and kept on
the to wire. SILVER STYLE led the way while saving ground through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around the far turn and weakened in
the final furlong. BROOKLYN GUY saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside from there, came around the far turn in the
two path and made no bid. THE BEARRISH ONE trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, saved ground around the
second bend and was never a factor.

Footnotes
MAJOR FRONTIER raced in the two path around the first turn, stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge while racing in
the three path around the second bend and dueled down the lane to just hold the win. MAGICAL ADVENTURE tracked the pace setter on the inside through
the opening half mile, began a bid from the two path nearing the three eighths pole and dueled down the stretch, narrowly missing. VLADISLAV trailed the
field from the two path around the first turn, moved up to race in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, began
a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground steadily to the wire. JUST PRAISE saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the
pack for the run up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend and improved position in the final furlong. CHINA BEACH was
carried out to the five path coming around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, angled in to race in the two
path around the far turn and finished evenly. GUNMAN led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled while saving
ground around the second bend and tired in the stretch. CANYOUHEARMENOW was bumped and squeezed back leaving the gate, raced at the back of
the pack on the inside through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three path, swung wide into the stretch and made no bid.
LIVEFORTHESONG drifted out to the four path coming around the first turn, settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, saved
ground around the far turn and was empty from there.
