Footnotes
PSYCHE was well placed early, then drafted behind the leader on the inside and made a inside bid leaving the turn, then kicked clear in the furlong grounds
to prove best under a drive. TILTED TIARA set the pace on the inside, was well rated and came into the lane two wide, then came out under left handed
crop urging by the furlong marker, then was corrected and shifted back in, then ran on but could not go with the winner late, second best. DOWSER stalked
the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn, then shifted in when straightened, then had to check by the furlong marker when the pace setter
came out into path, flattened out, bested rest. MOVING IN STEREO was rated along early, two wide by the quarter pole and had no kick. DALLAS was
taken back on the inside, advanced on the turn and swung out four wide for the drive and had no rally. CIRCLE OF COURAGE was reserved three wide
early and failed to respond. The jockey on number five DOWSER claimed foul against number two TILTED TIARA for interference at the eighth pole, after
the STEWARDS reviewed the replays they DISQUALIFIED TILTED TIARA FROM SECOND AND PLACED HER THIRD. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING

Footnotes
LTL BEAR SALOON was away alertly to set the pace along the inside, drew clear leaving the turn and then remained clear to prove best, driving.
MISCHIEVOUS JONES was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn and came five wide into the lane, finished willingly to gain the place
award. PRATT stalked the pace two to three wide and lacked the needed winning bid in the lane, bested rest. MR BOLDACIOUS was settled early,
advanced two wide on the turn and was between rivals by the sixteenth marker and had no rally. INNUENDO was well placed along the inside and
weakened. LONG TOM lacked a rally. PRINCE OF CAPS tracked the pace four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
LITTLE DEMON stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid on the turn to take over by the quarter pole, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best,
driving. P JS SILVER DUKE was taken back early on the inside, advanced on the turn while saving ground, then was blocked leaving the three sixteenths to
nearing the sixteenth marker, then split rivals and finished well late to gain the place award. COOL COMEDIAN was reserved early on the inside, tipped out
two wide on the turn and finished willingly to just miss the place award. TRIBAL NOTION was allowed to settle early on the inside, shifted out and made a
four wide move on the turn but flattened out, lost show award. BAR FOURTEEN was three wide into the first turn gunning for the lead, then set the pace on
the inside by the six furlong marker and then was headed by the five sixteenths and tired. TRIPLE A. PLUS was well placed on the inside and tired.
CRITICAL THINKING was settled three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
KEYSTONE WARRIOR was settled early while being ridden along to keep up, saved ground on the turn and was roused by the five sixteenths, then was
shifted out four wide leaving the turn and given one pop right handed with the crop, then switched to the left hand by the furlong marker and responded well
to draw out to prove best. HOWMUCHAREYOUWORTH was off slowly, settled back early, came five wide into the lane and finished well late to be clearly
second best. ROSE OF SHANAKILL vied for the early lead on the inside, then let the speed go and rated on the inside on the turn, shifted off the inside
nearing the quarter pole to make a two wide bid leaving the turn to go on even terms for command nearing the furlong marker but flattened out, bested rest.
QUEEN WIGGY vied for the lead three wide and then made a bid to draw clear on the turn and drop to the inside, then weakened the final furlong.
NOWYOUSCAN'TLEAVE was fractious in the gate, then was off a step slow, saved ground and failed to menace. PEACH BE WITH Q was fractious in the
gate, bumped at the start, then was not a threat. IOANNA stalked the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
ZILLION was well rated early, saved ground on the turn and made a inside bid leaving the turn, then drew away in the furlong grounds to porove best under
mild urging. RACING IN THE RAIN tracked the pace along the inside, eased off the inside nearing the quarter pole and came three wide into the lane, then
finished willingly to get the place award. SPOOKY ONE tracked the pace three wide, came five wide into the lane and finished willingly but was outkicked for
the place award. ECLIPTICALS BEAR set a pressured pace on the inside while two wide, then shook clear on the turn and then weakened the final furlong.
MIZZEN MONEY pressed the pace three wide and came four wide into the lane and was empty. SASSY LAD failed to menace. HEARTNESS was not a
threat.

MS STRONG HEART was rated along early, advanced on the turn and came four wide into the lane, then was slowly gaining i9n the furlong grounds and
got up late to prevail under a drive. AMI'S LINK was settled back early on the inside, advanced on the turn three wide, came five wide into the lane and
closed well on the outside. JEANETTEO stalked the early pace, made a two wide bid on the turn to take over, drew clear leaving the turn and still led by the
sixteenth marker but faded late. WILL TAKE ROSES was allowed to settle early, made a inside middle move on the backstretch but lacked a late response.
MY DIXIE LASS was allowed to settle early between rivals, lacked a rally. RAIN LILLY set the pace on the inside and gave way. AMEN SYLVIA was

Footnotes
MI GUSTO ES broke inward at the start, then was well placed on the inside after rushing up, then shifted out and made a three wide bid on the turn, then
had a long drive and hit the front leaving the furlong marker and then held on late to prevail under a drive. JEKYLL ISLAND tracked the pace three wide and
came four wide into the lane and was gaining late to just miss. ASK THE UMPIRE was bumped at the start, then went up to set the pace while in the two
path, then dug in in the lane and was outkicked late, bested rest. JACK SLYE was allowed to settle early, made a mild bid on the inside but needed more.
FORECLOSURE was bumped at the start, reserved early and lacked a rally. MISTER ARANGUIZ failed to menace. DOMINANT DESTROYER broke
outwardly at the start, chased the pace four wide and stopped.
