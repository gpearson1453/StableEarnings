win as much the best under a hand ride. STAR ENTERTAINER trailed for a half, rallied through the stretch two wide and got up for second.
ONEMORANDTHECHECK away alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside for a half then was outfinished. DUKE OF FENWAY advanced outside on
the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. GOLD HERITAGE failed to menace. DAWN WEST close up along the inside, was through early. OLD FORTY
FIVE with the second flight between horses, weakened on the far turn. FOLLOW YOUR DREAM vied for the early lead three wide and was through after a

urging. GRAYWING never far back, rallied through the stretch three wide and finished second best. BIG BAD BEAST trailed into the stretch, swung wide,
angled in from five wide to two wide and was steadily gaining ground late. DOCTOR WU offered a mild bid widest into the stretch then leveled off. BIG
BROWN SHOES pressed the pace five then two wide into the stretch, dropped inside and faded late. RIKIO sped to the lead soon after the start, set a
pressured pace two wide into the turn, had speed into the stretch then weakened. TEMPLEMAN ALLEY failed to respond. MY GRASS IS BLUE pressed the

marker and finished full of run to win going away. JUSTINSPEIGHTOFIT sped to the front soon after the start, set a pressured pace, drifted to the five path
entering the stretch then was no match for the winner. SUNNY BEAST broke slowly and had a mild late rally. KAPHAVATA pressed the pace two wide into
the stretch, drifted out to the middle of the racetrack and weakened late. THE EQUINEST hit the gate at the start and passed tiring rivals. DIAMOND
MONEY was no factor. TWICE AS SMART was through early. WHO CAN WIN had good early speed four wide and gave way on the turn. THE STEWARDS

Footnotes
DANES LAST SONG stalked the pace into the stretch, rallied three wide in the five path under right handed urging and was along in time.
WILLIAMSBEACHBABE with the second flight, saved ground, had a mild late rally and finished second best. KISS VALENTINA away alertly, pressed the
pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, shook clear in upper stretch, maintained the advantage until deep stretch then was outfinished. SWEET
MOBILTEE with the second flight two wide, went evenly in the five path through the stretch. WEEKENDING with the second flight three wide, moved closer
on the turn then came up empty. THELMA LUCILLE was no threat. HALO EFFECT was no factor. CANELA FINA set the early pace along the inside and
was used up. MORNINGBEACHWALK was never close, lost contact with her field, was pulled up leaving the turn and walked off.
