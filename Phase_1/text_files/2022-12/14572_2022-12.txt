Footnotes
LADY ENVOY took control from the outside soon after the start, angled in to save some ground when showing the way through the first turn, rated in the run
up the backstretch, shook off a couple of foes turning for home and drew off through the lane under steady handling. PEACEFUL MOMENT settled early
along the inside, began a steady advance second turn, between foes midstretch then floated in a bit by SAENGER STAR then outfinished that rival for the
place, no threat to the winner. SAENGER STAR in the second flight early off rail, angled in second turn, asked soon after, came in the two path for the drive,
drifted in a bit just inside the furlong marker to float PEACEFUL MOMENT inward, outkicked by that one for the second spot. TEQUILA EMPIRE bobbled at
the break, recovered to race three wide and with the second flight first turn, closer then challenged outside the winner midway on the second bend, gave
way. ROCKABILLIE last to leave, steadied when a bit tight first turn, moved closer while three wide in the second turn, faltered in the drive. NELLY TOO
chased the winner early, began to retreat before a half. HER NAME WAS LOLA pulled early toward the inside, had nothing for the drive.

Footnotes
SLAM DUNK SERMON outrun in the early going, scrubbed on to be asked for some run midway on the turn, came three wide for the drive, made little
progress upper stretch then launched a late surge to be up in time. BIG NICK away in good order, pressured the leader from the outside for a half,
continued to apply pressure to that one upper stretch, wore down that same rival late to gain the advantage, nipped in the final strides while between horses
at the wire. FULL IMPACT broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch, continued to show the way through much of the stretch, gave ground
grudgingly to the top two while inside that pair at the wire. MO'S MOJO settled off the pace in the two path, lacked a response when called on for the drive.
TURFY lacked speed while saving ground, improved slightly while not a serious threat. MAGIC CASTLE raced in mid pack and along the inside, had little for
the drive. J. E.'S HANDMEDOWN remained always back in failing to threaten. OCELOT off a bit slow, tired while racing three wide throughout.

Footnotes
ADALINE JULIA closest to the leader toward the inside, took over in the two path midway on the turn, shook well clear upper stretch, continued to expand
that advantage to the wire while under wraps late to win ridden out. LADY COMMANDER lacked early foot, raced four wide when moving closer through
much of the turn, rallied while widest to be up for the place, no threat to the winner. DIAL TONI in the second flight early off the inside, three wide when
moving closer late in the bend, chased the winner upper stretch, also proved no match for that one, flattened and was caught late for the place. TYRONA
broke in and back, moved up to race forwardly toward the inside, in some traffic into and through much of the turn, had little when clear for the drive.
CHARTREUSE in mid pack toward the inside, came three wide and between foes turning for home, failed to respond in the drive. SHEZA CAT broke slowly,
trailed inside, continued to be outrun into the stretch, no threat. WISE MEMORIES was never involved while racing off the inside. MO WANNA GO washy,
broke on top, clear early, gave way when headed in the turn.

Footnotes
YUUGIRI broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch along the inside, continued to set the pace turn and into the lane, roused past the furlong
marker, drew clear and was kept to task to the wire. HOT AND SULTRY pressed the winner from the outside for a half, lost some ground to that one into the
lane, could do little with that same rival the final furlong, clearly second best. QUEENS UP in the second flight while along the inside, continued to save
some ground into the stretch, proved no match for the top two, best of the rest. OFF RAMP in the second group while between horses, continued one paced
through the lane in lacking a closing response.. SECRET FIX went evenly while racing three wide. VERYLITTLECENTS trailed throughout while also racing
three wide.

THOUGHT broke on top, clear into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch, responded when confronted from the outside far turn,
rebroke to be clear again into the stretch, comfortably held the runner up safe late under continued steady handling. HUGE BIGLY lacked speed well off he
inside, dropped to the rail midway on the second turn, continued to save ground into the lane, rallied up the rail to finish up willingly to be slowly getting to
the winner late, clear for the place. ROCKET ONE off step slow, three wide when off the pace first turn, moved closer while four wide midway on the turn,
three wide into the lane, drifted out a bit past the furlong marker, rallied to be up for the show. DERBY CODE void of early foot, angled out to be three wide
and between horses into the stretch, encountered some traffic then altered course to the inside with a furlong to run, finished up evenly. AMERICAN
TATTOO (ARG) made little impact while racing toward the inside most of the way. MR. TIP stumbled at the start, trailed most of the way, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. POLTERER prompted the winner from the outside for five furlongs, moved abreast of that one far turn,
dueled then gave way when the real running began at the head of the lane. MUGSY MALONE four wide into the first turn, settled in mid pack thereafter,
gave way in the drive.

FLAP JACK moved up inside to take control before a furlong, shook clear far turn, was given a breather through the bend, not serious threatened through
the lane under steady handling. WINDCRACKER broke back, raced unhurried while saving ground, continued along the rail, displayed some interest up the
inside in late stretch to gain the nod for the place. COSMO void of speed while racing just off the inside, came three wide for the drive, displayed some
modest late interest, missed the nod for the place. GINSBURNED within striking distance along the inside, angled out turning for home, had little left to finish
up evenly. MACRON behind the pace outside, raced three wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. TIN BADGE chased the winner early, stopped.

Footnotes
AALIYAH EZRI dueled up front while under firm restraint, shook clear of the other speed far turn, maintained daylight upper stretch, enough left to hold the
runner up safe late. DIVINE HOPE in some traffic into the first turn when forwardly placed, settled in the run up the backstretch, additional traffic through
much of the second bend, clear for the drive, finished up with good late energy to be rapidly getting to the winner in the final strides. MCMANSION forwardly
placed through the first turn, remained within striking distance in the two path, final bend, lacked a winning response through the lane, narrowly saved the
show. CANDY KICK off a bit slow, trailed well back for five furlongs, angled out to be four wide turning for home, displayed some interest to the wire while
too late. RUSSIARUSSIARUSSIA squeezed and bothered to be off slowly, raced back, three wide exiting the turn and also improved position in finding best
stride too late. LANTERN'S CANDY went one paced while racing off the inside. BACHELORETTE broke on top, set or forced the pace along the inside for
five furlongs and gave way. ABBY THE BULL DAWG lacked speed, five wide into the far turn, failed to muster a rally when called on. ELI'S GIRL in mid
pack toward the rail, shuffled back a bit far turn, remained back when clear through the lane. LANDSLID made little impact while racing three wide. HAL'S
DREAM was finished early.

Footnotes
SUMMER SHOES moved up to contest the pace the opening furlong, held a narrow advantage out of the turn in the two path, continued to duel past the
furlong marker, came out late while holding the runner up safe late. CONNIE K dueled up front outside the winner, pressed that one through most of the
stretch, carried out in the final strides while unable to get back to that same rival. UNBRIDLED TWISTER prompted the top two from the outside, floated out
a bit to be four wide turning into the stretch, had little for that same pair the final furlong, saved the show. PUNCHY GIRL back off the pace and the inside,
improved through most of the stretch, slow gain for the show late, no threat to the top two. KABOOM BABY mid pack and inside, continued to save ground
turn, lacked a closing punch the final furlong. TOO PRETTY failed to seriously menace while racing off the inside. MY DAMS ATITUDE last to leave,
remained back for a half, steered out five wide turning for home, also was found lacking in the late going. HISSY MISSY broke back and failed to menace.
HEATED ARGUMENT within striking distance well out in the strip, staged a steady retreat three wide. HOT SPRINGS BLING in the second flight while five
wide into the turn, gave way. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN THROUGH DEEP STRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
K J'S PISTOL ANNIE close from the start, took over three wide into the lane, shook clear, when straightened for home, maintained daylight to the wire under
steady handling. SWEET HOLINESS with the pace while in the three path, could do little with the winner the final furlong, clearly second best.
BOOTLEGGING GIRL settled in mid pack off the inside, also came three wide for the drive, finished up best of the rest. LITTLE ROCKER broke toward the
front, vied for the lead closest to the inside, gave way in the drive. ALLELUIA ANGEL prompted the issue up front four wide for a half, also faltered for the
stretch run. LORI'S EYES lacked speed, improved position slightly while racing three wide. VALENTINE ANGEL with the first flight between foes, shuffled
back a bit late backstretch, fell back then continued to weaken through the lane. SWEET BABY KATE brushed, steadied to be off slowly, picked off a couple
of tiring rivals after the issue had been decided. MIZ GISELA off a step slow, raced back while four to five wide turn. LIL' BIT OF CHROME was never a
factor.
