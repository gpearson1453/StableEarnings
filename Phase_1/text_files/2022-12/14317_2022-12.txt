Footnotes
LASSAROCK was unhurried, trailed to the turn, advanced two wide in upper stretch, slipped to the rail nearing mid-stretch, closed well in the final furlong,
came within aim of TRUE COMFORT in deep stretch and made a late push in the final stages to prevail. TRUE COMFORT broke alertly and was sent to the
early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, drew clear nearing the top of the lane, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, was tiring inside of the furlong marker
and was all out in deep stretch, was overtaken by LASSAROCK in the final stages and held for second. PETE'S INFERNO rated off of the early pace, came
in tight and was boxed in midway through the turn, found room in upper stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, ran evenly in the final stages and
held for third. JACKIE SERMON tracked the pace between runners on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and weakened. ANGRY EMMY showed early
speed and tracked the early pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and tired in the stretch. JEANIE'S SWAN brushed leaving the start, chased the solid
early fractions to the turn, lost ground while along the inside nearing the top of the lane and gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
SMILING LADY broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, drew clear along the first turn, was well handled through the backstretch run while on a long
lead, became a bit unfocused entering the second turn and lost a bit of the margin nearing the quarter marker, quickened in upper stretch, drew off in the
final furlong and was not challenged in the late stages. SMOKEMS TAPHOUSE was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground through the backstretch
run and into the second turn, swung three wide for the drive, was no match for SMILING LADY in the final furlong but closed into the winner's margin in
deep stretch and was up for second. MOOSIE ONNA was allowed to settle, improved position two wide on the second turn, was roused four wide at the top
of the lane, rallied in mid-stretch and missed for second, while well clear at the end for third. BYE BYE BUGGSY broke in leaving the start and was away a
step slowly, settled off of the early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, gained ground nearing the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch
and weakened. DANIELLE'S SECRET was forwardly placed in the early going, raced closest to the loose leaders while tracking the decent fractions, made
a bit of a gain on the pacesetter on the far turn, was outrun in upper stretch and tired in the final stages.

Footnotes
BIG SWEDE was forwardly placed into the first turn, prompted the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, advanced nearing the quarter marker
and confronted the pacesetter approaching the top of the lane, battled with RIVER'S BEHEST to mid-stretch, shook free inside of the furlong marker and
kicked clear in the final stages. TEX HANLEY stalked the early pace, raced two wide along the first turn, gained ground three wide on the second turn,
swung four wide for the drive, was outkicked by BIG SWEDE in the final furlong and was up for second in the late stages. UPSTART YANKEE settled off of
the early fractions, was roused four then five wide nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch and rallied in the final stages to secure third.
CARSON'S LEGACY saved ground into the first turn while stalking the pace, maintained position through the backstretch run and into the second turn, ran
evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. LOOKOUT POINT allowed to settle, saved all of the ground to the second turn and did not threaten in the
stretch run. RIVER'S BEHEST showed early speed and cleared the field into the first turn, set moderate fractions while prompted by BIG SWEDE through
the backstretch run, was confronted by that rival nearing the quarter marker, battled with the winner to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. BIG
VANILLA bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, was unhurried through the early going, lost contact on the second turn, was eased through the
stretch and walked off under his own power.

THEYREMINISCEOVERU broke alertly and showed speed to set the early pace, set modest fractions through the backstretch run while pressured, was
pressed to the quarter marker by AUTISMS WORLD, shook free from that rival in upper stretch, kept to task in the drive and held sway in deep stretch.
AUTISMS WORLD was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to
THEYREMINISCEOVERU to the quarter marker, was turned away by that rival in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and held well for second in the
final stages. WALKING BOSS was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide along the first turn, advanced three wide on the far turn, mounted a four
wide rally in upper stretch, ran evenly to the furlong grounds and made a mild late bid to secure third. IMPLICITLY saved ground while settling off of the
early fractions, raced two wide along the second turn, came in tight in upper stretch, finished evenly in the drive and just missed for third in the final strides.
POUR ON THE COLE was unhurried in the early stages, came in tight while along the rail nearing the quarter marker, lacked room in upper stretch and
flattened out in the final furlong. BIG CITY BANE tracked the early pace, raced three wide along the first turn, came three wide to the quarter marker and
gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
APPLAUD THE BENCH broke alertly and established the early lead, set reasonable fractions while rating nicely through the backstretch run, set a
pressured pace to the quarter marker, turned away DANCE LADY in upper stretch and drew away under hand urging in the final stages. DANCE LADY
showed speed leaving the start and prompted the early fractions, advanced along the backstretch and pressed the reasonable pace to the second turn, was
repelled by APPLAUD THE BENCH in upper stretch, could not keep pace with the winner in the drive and held for second in the final stages.
COASTARANDO was away in good order, was shuffled back on the first turn while encountering traffic, settled off of the pace through the backstretch run,
advanced three wide on the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and made a late rally to get up for third. DR WYSONG stalked the early pace, came three
wide into the first turn, advanced two wide on the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and did not produce a late rally. CAN'THELPFALLIN (IRE) was allowed
to settle, saved all of the ground to the second turn and did not factor in the drive. RUNNING LUCK was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the
decent fractions from the inside to the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. TEAM CONCEPT rated off of the early pace,
raced in the second flight through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn and did not threaten late.

DESERT DUDE assumed command of the early lead, set pedestrian fractions while prompted through the backstretch run, held foes at bay to the quarter
marker, was set down for the drive and extended the lead nearing mid-stretch, dug in in the final stages and held sway at the end. DEALERS HAND raced
close to the early pace, stalked the modest fractions through the backstretch run, ran evenly to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, was kept at
bay by DESERT DUDE in the final stages and held well for second. AGENT ZERO was a bit rank in the early stages, was unhurried while saving ground
through the backstretch run, was roused along the second turn, rallied in upper stretch, finished well in the late stages, challenged for second and held
safely for third in the end. COOLCROSS showed early speed and prompted the early pace, kept close attendance to DESERT DUDE to the second turn,
lost position in upper stretch and weakened. CANYON CREST was allowed to settle in the early going, made a three wide bid on the second turn, could not
sustain that run in the drive and flattened out in the late stages. PILLAR MOUNTAIN (IRE) was allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, raced
two wide to the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late response. ENGRAM tracked the early pace, raced three wide outside of rivals
along the first turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, dropped back nearing the quarter marker and was empty in the stretch run.

SMILEFORME rated off of the quick early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, loomed nearing the
furlong marker, assumed command in mid-stretch and kicked clear in the final sixteenth. HANDSOME GARY tracked the rapid early pace, advanced three
wide on the turn, continued that bid to mid-stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong marker, could not match strides with SMILEFORME in the final
stages and held for second in the final strides. OUR EXPECTATION lacked early speed, saved ground along the turn, tipped out two wide for the drive,
finished well in the final furlong and was up in the final strides for third, while just missing for second. LIGHTINTHEDARKNESS showed good early speed
and dictated terms to the turn, set fast fractions while off of the rail to the quarter marker, came under pressure nearing mid-stretch, was overtaken leaving
the furlong pole, weakened in the final sixteenth and was just edged for third. BEAR CHUM (AUS) was a bit slow into stride early on, chased the fast pace
outside of rivals, made a four wide bid nearing the quarter marker, did not go on with that run in the drive and flattened out. QUIET CHARM showed early
speed and was forwardly placed to the turn, raced two wide between foes on the turn and came in tight nearing the top of the lane, dropped back in upper
stretch and faded in the drive. PHANTOM DROP showed early speed then took back to track the fast early fractions, saved ground along the turn, advanced
nearing the quarter marker, lost ground nearing mid-stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LOVE CANDY was allowed to settle off of the fast early fractions, saved ground through the turn, rallied along the inside in upper stretch, closed fast and
came within aim inside of the furlong marker, assumed command nearing the sixteenth-marker and held in a drive in the final stages. STORMY SAMURAI
tracked the fast early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, advanced nearing mid-stretch, was outfinished by LOVE CANDY in the final sixteenth and
was up in the final strides to secure second. ALMANERA (IRE) showed early speed and pressed the fast pace to the turn, kept close attendance to FAST
PER SE to the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead inside of the furlong marker, could not keep pace with LOVE CANDY
in deep stretch and was just edged for second, while holding for third. LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was allowed to settle in the early stages, came two wide
into the turn, was roused five wide in upper stretch, closed willingly in the final furlong and challenged for third in the final strides. I'M DR. O tracked the
quick early pace, raced two wide along the turn, swung four wide for the drive and found his best stride late. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM raced close up to the
fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, ran evenly to the furlong marker and was outkicked in deep stretch. FAST PER SE showed good early
speed after an alert beginning, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch and gave way in the final stages. C'MON MAN
broke slowly, lacked early speed, trailed to the top of the stretch and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DISKO TRIBUTE was away alertly but backed away from a potential speed duel, tracked the pacesetting pair through the turn while under a snug hold,
swung into the three path entering the stretch, responded to strong handling and was up in time. MIKE DAD bumped MR. MASON at the break, engaged
with LOOKIN TO EXCEL from the outset, laid down a challenge approaching the quarter pole, could not keep pace in deep stretch with DISKO TRIBUTE
and just won the nod for second in the final strides. LOOKIN TO EXCEL broke out and bumped with ASANO'S BACK at the break, was then quick into
stride, grabbed the lead with MIKE DAD right to his outside, dueled that one gamely through the turn, held a narrow edge to mid-stretch, could not hold off
DISKO TRIBUTE in the final stages and was just edged for second on the line. ASANO'S BACK was off a step slow then bumped by LOOKING TO EXCEL,
dropped to last, angled over to the rail to save ground, was asked for more passing the five sixteenths pole, responded but was stuck behind horses in the
stretch, swung out for room in mid-stretch but was unable to make up the needed ground. MR. MASON bobbled at the break, then was bumped by MIKE
DAD, recovered well to gain a good stalking position, raced down the backstretch run, was brushed by DRAW THE FOUL near the half mile pole, made a
nice run at the leading pair through the turn, raced on the wrong lead for part of the stretch then shied from a swerving MR. MASON in deep stretch.
SHARONA'S WILD BOY broke with the pack, became rank and hard to place from the outset, brushed or bumped with several rivals in the run to the turn,
steadied hard near the three furlong marker then settled down and remained in contention in mid-stretch, but then bumped with MR. MASON and steadied
to avoid ASANO'S BACK within a few strides before being ridden out to the wire. DRAW THE FOUL broke with the pack then dropped back a bit, was
moving forwardly when forced to steady near the nine-sixteenths pole, stayed in the clear into the turn, attempted a rally but stalled at the quarter pole and
was outrun from there.
