Footnotes
FRONTLINER unhurried early, closed willingly in the middle of the racetrack through upper stretch, made the lead under left handed urging at the furlong
marker and drew off under a hand ride. JOSHY JAK vied for the lead into the stretch, loomed boldly three wide in the eight path before the furlong marker
then was no match for the winner. AMIGO'S AFFAIR pressed the pace two wide into the stretch, was carried out to the seven path by the leader then was
outfinished. D'MONEY HONEY failed to menace. CON ON THE RUN away alertly, set the pace off the rail in the four path, drifted to the six path entering
the stretch then weakened late. UNCLE KEVIN was no factor. PROFESSIONAL was through after a half.

going away. GOLDEN LASSIE sped to a daylight lead soon after the start, set the pace until deep stretch then couldn't handle the winner. CHARGAREE
was in tight at the start, allowed to settle, swung wide and finished determinedly in the six path. LILAC LACE with the second flight two wide, went evenly.
GO STELLAIRE failed to menace. PROUD MAID MARIAN was a sharp threat along the inside into the stretch then weakened. GIFT FROM MOM chased
the pace three wide into the stretch then weakened. LOVE'S TAVITO trailed.

Footnotes
BIG TRUCK close up from the start, rallied four then three wide through the far turn to make the lead nearing the quarter pole, set the balance of the pace
and drew off under left handed urging. RAISON KARTER trailed for a half, loomed boldly three wide into the stretch and finished clear for second. DYRDEK
vied for the early lead three wide, gained a narrow advantage at the half mile marker, set the pace through the far turn then was outfinished. THRU THE
VINE had his head turned as the gate opened, recovered to be within striking distance on the first turn, swung wide entering the stretch and lost ground.
MAGICAL EXPRESS pressed the early pace along the inside and gave way in the stretch. KITCHI away alertly, set the pace two wide for a half then was
used up.
