Footnotes
CUSTOM DESIGN set the pace inside of a pressing rival, shook free of that foe entering the lane, inched clear in upper stretch, and held sway while
hanging on her left lead. THE CALLING STONE was fractious loading, tracked along the inside, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to
reach place at the wire. SERIOUSLY SAM pressed the pace setter from the outside, but failed to keep pace in the four path entering the lane, yielded, and
was caught at the wire for place. HONEYSUCKLEDELIGHT bumped an inner rival at the start, chased outside of the top pair while requiring strong urging to
keep pace, but gave way while floating out to the seven path turning for home, then surpassed a stopping rival. AVIE J broke a step slowly while hopping a
bit before taking a bump from an outer rival at the start, trailed in the four to three paths into the turn, improved between horses turning for home while
shifting to the six path entering the lane, but quickly flattened out, and stopped in the final furlong.

Footnotes
LILRASCALMAN stalked three wide, took aim on the leader in upper stretch, ranged up while hanging on his left lead to bid at the furlong grounds, and
sparred through the late stages while edging an advantage. BIG SCULLY set the pace two wide, inched clear at the quarter pole as an outer
LILRASALMAN pursued, dug in when confronted at the furlong grounds, but gave in grudgingly in the late stages. TOTALLY ADDICTED broke a step slow
at the start, tracked in the four to five paths around the turn, gained show in upper stretch, and ran on to secure that position. MY HEAVY SON also broke a
beat slow, laid further back in the three path, tipped inwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on to improve inside of rivals. FOOLISH DREAMS stalked in the
four to four path while being the leading group around the turn, but yielded between rivals at the three sixteenths pole. OAK HILL SOLUTION trailed along
the inside, and was outrun. INTHEALY vied along the inside, pressed the outer leader under a snug hold around the turn, then lugged to the three path
entering the lane, and caved in upper stretch.

Footnotes
UNANIMOUSLY got a bit crowded between horses after breaking a beat slow, lacked speed along the inside, inched forward to a two wide tracking position
entering the far turn, pursued the top pair turning for home, tipped in to aim inside of those rivals in upper stretch, grinded away to bid leaving the furlong
grounds, and edged an advantage nearing the wire. WAR COUNT ran clear in the three to four path around the first turn, was confronted by an outer rival
while in the three path around the far turn, got headed by that foe entering the lane before an inner rival joined the fray leaving the furlong grounds, fought
gamely between horses through the late stages, but was bested by his inner counterpart. LIKE MIKE stalked two wide, ranged up outside of the leader and
in the four path to bid with five sixteenths to go, led entering the lane, but flattened out in the final furlong while sparring with a pair of inner rivals, and gave
way late. RUN ROCKET lacked speed three wide, took the far turn in the four to five paths, and lacked a bid. GREELEY WENT WEST trailed two wide and
never got involved. STANDING MAN stalked along the inside, but chased the leading pair around the far turn before giving way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
LIGHTNING STRUCK prompted the embattled leading pair from the outside, bid entering the lane, drove clear while shifting ground outwardly in upper
stretch, met an inner challenge leaving the furlong grounds, but safely held sway thereafter. CLASSIC KING broke a step slowly at the start, stalked along
the inside while a bit off of the rail, tipped to the four path entering the lane, rallied while aiming inside of the clear leader entering the final furlong, attempted
a bid soon after, but was kept at bay through the late stages. BOYFRIEND MATERIAL tracked four wide, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and
kept on for show. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE dueled for the lead inside of a pair of rivals, but was headed entering the lane, gave way approaching midstretch,
and lost show a sixteenth from home. SPECIAL PRYCE bobbled mildly while breaking a beat slowly, trailed along the inside, shifted out in upper stretch,
and never got involved. CANDY PRINCE sparred for the lead two wide and between rivals, but failed to keep pace with his outer competitor at the quarter
pole, and weakened at the three sixteenths marker.

Footnotes
BIG COUNTRY set the pace inside of a pressing foe while a bit off of the rail, shook clear of him while well in hand at the five sixteenths pole, and drew off
under light urging. GOLDEN PEGASUS tracked the top pair from the four path, ranged closer to them in the five path around the far turn, gained place while
failing to keep pace with the clearing leader entering the lane, and was second best. LEROY JENKINS laid off of the pace two to three wide, and ran on.
DUDE DROP KID tracked in midpack in the two path, pursued from between horses down the backstretch, but gave way in midstretch. STOCKPILER broke
slowly while hopping at the start, trailed three wide, then four wide around the far turn, and moved up. IRONMAN RICHIE broke out at the start, pressed the
leader while remaining a path away from him and in the four path around the first turn, sustained pressure from the three path into the far turn, but
weakened while getting outkicked for place at the five sixteenths pole. MASQUERADE BALL turned his head to the left before the gates opened and saw
them sprung without correcting, came out slowly in the process, laid off of the pace along the inside, improved to a tracking position down the backstretch,
but faded around the far turn.

MOMENT set the pace in the three path, shook clear of an outer rival while well in hand in the two path around the far turn, then widened his margin under
driving pressure. TRIVISTA laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, then stayed on among rivals to gain place from an outer rival late. MAU MAU
raced at the rear in the five path and outside of foes around the first turn, improved while tucking to th four path entering the far turn, shifted out to the six
path before completing a bid for show in upper stretch, and leveled off. SUPER WISE pressed the leader from the four path early on, chased that rival from
the three path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, managed place through midstretch, but faltered between horses in the closing
stages. SIERRA HOTEL stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase before yielding late. KIDYOUNOT hopped and broke slowly at the start, saved
ground off of the pace, but faded turning for home.

TIZPLENTY sparred for the lead outside of the pace setter, dueled entering the lane, forged an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, and drove clear
entering the final sixteenth. REPEALING set the pace inside of a prompting rival, battled with that foe around the turn and entering the lane, but was headed
at the three sixteenths pole, then failed to keep pace a sixteenth from home. READY FOR CHANGE chased along the inside while a bit off of the rail, then
stayed on well through the final furlong in pursuit of the top pair. CHAMPAGNE AFFAIR trailed in the four path, then moved up in the six path.
MISCHIEVOUS DIANE bobbled at the start while breaking with the field, stalked outside of the embattled leading pair, pressed them around the turn, but
weakened entering the lane. ROOKERY laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, and failed to factor.

Footnotes
ZOZOS tracked in the two path, moved out to the five path entering the backstretch, pursued four wide and ou5side of foes around the far turn, inched
closer entering the lane, took aim on the clear leader approaching midstretch, bid leaving the furlong grounds under driving pressure, and drew clear
through the final sixteenth. TREASURY set a clear pace while just off of the rail, maintained a wide margin through upper stretch, but was collared leaving
the furlong pole, proved no match at the sixteenth marker, and was second best. PORTOS saved ground off of the pace, gained show from outer rivals
approaching the furlong grounds, and held. AMERICAN HERO was slow early and lagged behind the group around the first turn, swung ot the seven path in
upper stretch, and moved up outside of foes in the final furlong, yet ran out of ground to reach fourth. MY ROMEO LIMA tracked in the three to four paths,
failed to gain while three wide and between horses around the far turn, and tired. SUPER DESIGN shifted outside of the clearing leader around the first turn
to stalk from the three path, but failed to close in despite rider's urging around the far turn, and weakened between horses in upper stretch. NEW YEAR
SURPRISE lacked speed two wide, pursued from between horses around the far turn, and faded. DIRECT ORDER was outrun.

Footnotes
LIFEASWEKNOWIT tugged along the inside while achieving a stalking position behind the pace setter, exchanged bumps with an outer RICKY RIGHT at
the half mile pole, pursued from the pocket before tipping outside of the leader entering the lane to produce a bid between horses at the quarter pole,
sparred while gaining an advantage at the three sixteenths pole, dueled gamely thereafter, lightly brushed an outer rival coming to the final sixteenth, and
held late. STARPORT set the pace along the inside under consistent coaxing, met a pair of bids at the quarter pole, battled while getting headed at the three
sixteenths pole, fought on gamely thereafter, but failed to regain even terms. SPREADING RUMORS tracked four wide, stayed on through the late stages
with a grinding rally, and reached show just before running out of ground to reel in place. CHIPEEE stalked three to two wide into the turn, got floated back
three wide before bidding at the quarter pole, vied through midstretch while hanging on his left lead, but was subtly brushed by an inner foe approaching the
final sixteenth, and yielded at that juncture. STAR READY laid off of the pace while hung five wide, and faded. RICKY RIGHT tracked two wide and between
horses, exchanged bumps with an inner rival at the half mile pole before being coaxed outside of the leading pair entering the turn, but gave way among
rivals turning for home. KING CHROME raced at the rear in the four path, and made little impact. CAME OUT KICKIN laid off of the pace along the inside,
failed to respond to urging entering the turn, and was outrun.
