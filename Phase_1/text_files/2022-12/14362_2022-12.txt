Footnotes
MELTING SNOW went to the front, showed the way while well out in the track, extended the advantage late on the backstretch, drew off in the two path
around the turn, was set down in upper stretch, raced under a strong hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole then one more inside the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a brisk hand-ride to the wire. TILSA tracked the pace on the
outside, fell further behind the leader leaving the backstretch, was roused in the three path early on the turn, continued three wide into the stretch and
earned the place while no match for the winner. KERIK settled on the outside, was urged four wide around the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive and
missed the place while well clear for the show. THAT IS KEY tossed her head at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, settled off the
pace, raced between foes starting inside the three-quarter pole, was urged three wide between foes on the turn, dropped back four wide into the stretch and
had nothing left. LINNY KATE raced just off the pace between foes, was urged along in the two path while still between rivals on the turn and capitulated.
SWEET BLINDNESS broke in and hit the gate, was positioned just off the pace on the inside, saved ground under urging on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
JOHN'S PROTEGE was carried out at the start, showed speed on the outside of SUPER QUALITY while carried way out in the track by that foe, chased
down the backstretch, went around the turn in the four path, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole, took over in upper stretch, shook clear outside the
sixteenth-pole and drew away under steady urging. SUPER QUALITY was bumped at the start and forced out then lugged out, drifted near the middle of the
track while showing the way, dropped in later on the backstretch, went three then two wide around the turn, was asked under threat coming to the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought with that foe until outside the sixteenth-pole then weakened but held the place.
NORTH POLE hit the inside of the gate while off a step slow then bumped hard with a foe and was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, was urged
along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and missed the place while clear for the show. SEAN THE HAMMER
broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled, chased the pace down the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path
and tired. PAPI ON ICE bobbled shortly after the start then was hustled, dropped to the rear while showing no speed, went four then five wide on the turn,
drifted inward in upper stretch and was no factor. SHARPOON broke out at the start, dropped back under urging, went around the turn in the two path and
showed little. GENESIS ONE bumped hard with a rival while off a step slow then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, saved ground on the turn
and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
CURBSTONE went two then three wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, moved closer midway down the backstretch, gained to make a bid with a
half-mile to run, took the lead in the three path early on the far turn, shook clear outside the five-sixteenths, drew off into upper stretch, responded well in the
final furlong and proved much the best under steady urging. COMPLETE AGENDA lost his footing some at the start then was corrected off heels with a tug
of the right rein, dropped back in tight between horses nearing the first turn then angled in, saved ground around that bend, moved off the rail on the
backstretch, shifted further out around the half-mile pole, was urged four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the stretch and safely secured the place.
AFJAN bumped with a rival at the start, went around the first turn in the two path, was well placed just off the pace, chased in the three path around the far
turn, pursued the winner under a drive into upper stretch and weakened but held the show. STRONG LIGHT went five wide on the first turn, settled off the
pace, moved in before the far turn, shifted from the rail to the three path around that bend and failed to threaten. UNCLE WATER FLOW made light contact
with a foe at the start, went four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along passing the five-eighths, went four then five wide
on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and was no factor. SPETTRO bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, set the pace on the inside with
company to his outside, lost the lead early on the far turn and faded. BOURBON'S HOPE established a forward position early, raced in the three path
around the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was put to urging near the nine-sixteenths, came up empty in the two path on the far turn and
faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
SYNTHESIS was hustled after breaking at the rear of the field, moved into fourth position under urging, chased four wide around the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, bumped lightly with MARKET ALERT while in pursuit of the leader outside the furlong marker, gained to take the advantage into the
final sixteenth and prevailed under strong urging. AMUNDSON was hustled from the gate, angled in while showing good speed, pressed the pace on the
outside then in the two path around the turn, took the lead near the five-sixteenths then shook clear, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole then was
collared by the winner and missed but held the place. MARKET ALERT was recalcitrant behind the gate and reluctant to load, chased the pace on the
outside then three wide around the turn, bumped lightly with SYNTHESIS outside the furlong marker, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final
sixteenth and was out-kicked then eased up late while clear for the show. SENIOR INVESTMENT bumped lightly with a foe after the start then was taken
up, dropped well off the pace under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch then moved further out and gained but
failed to threaten. ARTHUR'S HOPE broke out a bit, was urged along at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn and was no factor.
FIRE SWORD was hustled from the gate then made light contact with an opponent, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the
turn, lost the lead at the five-sixteenths and faded. JALEN JOURNEY was urged along on the outside, went three wide around the turn, came out nearing
the quarter-pole and faltered then was eased but walked off.
