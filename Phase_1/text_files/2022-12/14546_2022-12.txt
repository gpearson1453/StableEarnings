LIMITED OFFER pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead into the stretch
and held sway to the wire. ASCOT STORM settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and was up for the place. TAINO HOUSE lacked
early foot, saved ground through the turn, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with a steady bid. MASTER RULER was away in good order to
duel for the lead from the inside with BAPTISM , vied with that rival for a half and weakened. BAPTISM broke sharply to dispute the pace with MASTER
RULER and weakened after a half. READY TO FORGIVE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally.
RESTORING DREAMS showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

complete authority. GUEST CHECK chased the winner while racing four-wide throughout and failed to gain on that rival in the drive. THIRSTY KISS chased
the winner from the inside throughout and gave way in the drive. GUARDSMAN PASS showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn,
angled out late and finished evenly. SOLANDER was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the second turn and gave way in the drive. TOUR
THE WORLD settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to rally. ABRIERWIN lacked early foot, saved ground
through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
STAR ENTRY was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and wore down AFTER
THE CANDY in the closing yards to be clear late. AFTER THE CANDY was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a
clear margin into the lane but could not resist the winner late. GOLDEN COWBOY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a
steady bid. ROCKY JACK was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and failed to gain in the drive. UPPER ROOM was void of early
foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. WARFRONT FIGHTER showed no early speed, raced eighth-wide through the turn and was
not a factor. STONUS MAXIMUS pressed the pace from the inside and weakened after going a half.

Footnotes
SHINNY was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn, reached the fore into the stretch and edged away late. NORTHCUT
sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way to the winner into the lane. MAJOR ATTRACTION chased the
leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. MAN FRIDAY bobbled at the start, lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn and
finished evenly late. FALSELY ACCUSED settled off the leaders early, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to
gain. GIANT PAYDAY raced off the pacesetters early, moved seven-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. RAIL HUGGER chased the leaders
while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half. BROTHER REID lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid.
BOBBY BRINKLEY raced four-wide through the first turn, raced just off the leaders, moved five-wide through the second turn and weakened. THE RACE
WAS HAND TIMED.
