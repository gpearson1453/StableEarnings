Footnotes
PACHI chased well behind the leading pair down the back straight, began to take closer order in the two path near the five sixteenths, swept to the lead
inside of RED HOT DEVIL into the lane, drove clear in the final furlong and increased his lead despite drifting out late. KREWE CHIEF raced in the rear pair
outside of BULLDOG OF BERGEN, continued in the rear pair in the two to three path on the turn, was driven between horses in the three path in upper
stretch, chased three wide in the final furlong and secured the place late. BULLDOG OF BERGEN settled in the rear pair inside of KREWE CHIEF, saved
ground around the turn, bid inside into the lane, proved no match for PACHI, chased on inside but lost the place late. RED HOT DEVIL broke sharply,
dueled outside of MIND YOUR OWN BIZ, took the lead in the two path from the seven sixteenths, floated out to the six path into upper stretch, was headed
by PACHI, kept on in range to midstretch, drifted in, and flattened out between horses in the final furlong. MIND YOUR OWN BIZ dueled inside of RED HOT
DEVIL while drawing well clear of the rest of the field, was no match for that foe from the seven sixteenths, shifted out from the rail to the three path after
being passed, was driven in the five path in upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT broke in and bumped STACY ATTACK, settled at the rear, raced patiently in the three path on the turn, dropped to the rail near the
five sixteenths, rallied into the lane, went to a drive near the three sixteenths, engaged inside of SHEZ RECKLESS and SAMARITA midstretch, battled to
the finish under a drive and proved best in the final strides. SHEZ RECKLESS broke sharply, dueled inside of SAMARITA down the backstretch and in the
two path on the turn, battled between horses in the lane, drifted out and bumped SAMARITA several times, continued gamely to the finish but could not
match LUCY'S LOOKING LEFT in the last few jumps. SAMARITA was keen between horses early, dueled outside of SHEZ RECKLESS down the
backstretch and in the three path on the turn, was driven three wide and continued to battle on the lead in the lane, was carried out and bumped several
times by SHEZ RECKLESS in the lane, and did not have enough in the final sixteenth. PALM COURT tracked inside behind the leading pair, was pushed
along at the inside of the tracking flight in the two to three path on the turn, swung out into the lane in the six path, and chased on evenly. MANHATTAN
LEGACY was reluctant to load, tracked the leading pair outside of PALM COURT, was urged between horses in the four path on the turn, swung out into the
lane in the seven to eight path, and flattened out. STACY ATTACK was bumped soundly by LUCY'S LOOKIN LEFT in the opening strides, raced near the
rear early but advanced to join the tracking flight three wide near the five eighths, raced in the five path with the tracking flight on the turn, swung into the
lane in the six to seven path, went to a drive, lacked the needed kick and emptied out in the final furlong.

Footnotes
RAINY MOUNTAIN tracked the leading pair, rallied three wide on the turn, led past the five sixteenths, cleared YANKEE AGATE in upper stretch, was
driven midstretch, drifted out but nonetheless drew off further. COWGIRL FRANKIE settled at the rear, continued patiently in the two path on the turn, began
to take closer order from near the five sixteenths, split horses and angled out in upper stretch, rallied with good interest and got up late for the place.
YANKEE AGATE was off sharp between horses, vied outside of CHASING GHOST'S, attended outside that foe past the five eighths, retook the lead two
wide near the seven sixteenths, was headed by RAINY MOUNTAIN past the five sixteenths, was urged inside in upper stretch but proved no match for the
new leader, flattened out and lost the place late. SODDY DAISY was midpack early but gradually settled back near the rear, dropped toward the inside near
the half, chased well behind the leading trio in the two path on the turn, and chased on only mildly in the lane. AWESOME KITTY settled near the rear,
pulled a bit past the five eighths, chased well behind the leading trio in the four to five path on the turn, was driven approaching the quarter, drifted out in the
lane and proved empty. CHASING GHOST'S was sent inside, vied with YANKEE AGATE, led near the five eighths, was headed by YANKEE AGATE near
the seven sixteenths, tracked along the rail from there, could not keep pace into the lane and weakened inside. W W VALID settled near the rear, raced in
the three path on the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch and mustered no bid.

Footnotes
MY REDEMPTION tracked the pacesetter inside of BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER early, settled back into the backstretch, raced three and then four wide with
the chasing flight, bid in the five path outside of RONNI'S STORM and IOYA AGAIN, loomed around the rest of the turn and while driven five wide into upper
stretch, took the lead approaching the furlong marker, drove clear past that pole and held off the closers to his outside. C F V WICKED RED settled near the
rear early, chased between horses into the backstretch, inched closer near the five eighths while still between horses, raced in the two path at the rear of the
compact main group around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, rallied well outside foes and gained to the finish. PISTOL BOX settled at the rear,
continued to trail through the first turn and down the back straight, began to take closer order along the rail on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and
went to a drive, rallied between horses, kept on with good interest to the finish but was outkicked for the place. IOYA AGAIN chased around the first turn,
raced at the inside of the chasing flight into the backstretch, took closer order in tandem with the rest of the flight in mid-backstretch, bid inside the leader
near the seven sixteenths, took the lead in upper stretch, was headed by MY REDEMPTION approaching the furlong mark, and weakened inside.
BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER was keen early to join the tracking flight outside of MY REDEMPTION, continued keen into the backstretch while tracking
between horses, raced three wide between horses into the far turn, tracked behind the leading line in the four path around that bend, swung six wide into the
lane and was carried out a bit further when C F V WICKED RED angled out, and came up empty. RONNI'S STORM was placed on the lead, cleared into
the first turn, continued clear down the back straight, took a dwindling lead into the far turn, was engaged by IOYA AGAIN to his inside and MY
REDEMPTION outside near the seven sixteenths, was headed into the lane and weakened past the three sixteenths.

Footnotes
BALADINE vied four and then three wide on the backstretch, dueled outside of MIDNIGHT ESCAPE around the turn in the three to four path, continued to
battle outside that foe down the lane under consistent handling and got the bob. MIDNIGHT ESCAPE vied inside down the backstretch, continued to battle
inside of BALADINE while saving ground around the turn, fought inside of that foe under a drive in the lane but lost the nod. BOONE'S PATH settled near
the rear, was pushed along approaching the half, rallied in the three to four path on the turn, chased the leading pair inside of UNDEFEATED CHAMP into
the lane, was outkicked by the leading pair to midstretch but kept on willingly and took a bit closer order on that leading pair late. GOLD SMOKE broke with
the leaders but settled back to track the leading line, chased in the five path on the turn, came five wide into the lane, and chased on mildly to prove best of
the rest. GUST OF WIND broke a bit slowly, soon trailed, saved ground around the turn, swung into the lane in the three to four path, was shown the crop
midstretch and finished with a belated rush. TEA WITH LEMON hit the gate, settled with the rear of the main group, raced in the six path on the turn, came
seven wide into the lane, and lacked the needed rally under a drive. SUMMER COUNTRY settled near the rear early, chased in the six path on the turn,
came six wide into the lane and flattened. UNDEFEATED CHAMP vied between horses down the backstretch, backed out near the seven sixteenths,
tracked in the three path from there, was driven outside of BOONE'S PATH in upper stretch and weakened past the three sixteenths. CHIEF MYSTIQUE
vied between horses early, backed out of the leading flight approaching the half, gradually weakened in the two path on the turn and had no more in the
lane.

Footnotes
KHOZAN'S VALENTINE prompted to gain contention inside foes racing just behind the pacesetter in the opening stages, was held up momentarily off the
leaders racing into the bend, switched off the inside on the turn, angled out sharply four wide in upper stretch and produced a steady late response to just
edge TETSU in time under firm right handed encouragement. The latter, reserved between foes in the opening quarter, angled to the inside racing through
the turn, tipped off the inside in upper stretch to split rivals three deep leaving midstretch to strike the front between calls late but was just outkicked.
IMPRESSED, settled out of tight quarters at the start to race last through the backstretch, angled outside foes gathering momentum nearing upper stretch to
race five wide in the lane and continued willingly in that path to the end to close the gap on the top pair. LATIN CASINO, urged to the lead along the inside
in the opening stages, dueled for command into the turn, then to upper stretch but faded inside rivals late. BRING ME A CHECK was urged three deep
pressing the pace through the backstretch into the turn and faded between foes in late stages. W W CANDY settled outside foes in the opening quarter, was
prompted to advance between rivals on the turn, was momentarily caught in tight quarters in upper stretch but came up empty racing through the lane.
LAUDA SPEED tracked off the first flight racing four wide through the backstretch to the turn and steadily faded nearing upper stretch. JACK VAN BERG,
urged between foes pressing the pace through the backstretch, gained a brief lead nearing upper stretch but gave out abruptly leaving the furlong marker
drive. MKAR THE FAST settled inside foes in the opening stages and retreated early.

Footnotes
GO EMI was settled outside foes in the last flight dropped well off the leaders racing to the backstretch, angled out six wide racing into upper stretch and
produced a stout rally through the closing stages to prevail in time under firm left handed encouragement. MEGAN'S HONOR, forwardly placed stalking the
pacesetter to the backstretch, advanced to press the issue outside that rival racing into the far turn, edged clear in upper stretch but couldn't contain the
winner. RED FLAG ALERT was rated off the second flight outside a rival to the backstretch, split foes after a half, then gained a position along the inside
racing into the far turn, shifted out to bid three wide nearing upper stretch but was outkicked by the top pair. SILVER QUARTERS settled inside foes in the
last flight to the backstretch, switched out on the far turn, angled out to race five wide between foes through the stretch and continued with a mild bid.
DIAMOND MAXIMUS settled between foes in the last flight in the opening half, angled to the inside racing into the far turn, saved ground to the lane and
continued with an effort to improve position. FIRST MASAMUNE, urged clear along the inside to the backstretch, dueled for command into the far turn and
gave way in the drive. PADDY'S HOUSE was rated off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn. CURRENT
tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, was prompted in a brief bid in that path racing into the far turn but soon flattened out.
GITA'S LAD tracked the leaders between foes in second flight to the backstretch, shifted out four wide racing into the far turn and gave way abruptly into
upper stretch. YOU'RE IN COREY was urged to gain a position inside foes in the second flight racing into the backstretch but steadily retreated after a half.

Footnotes
GOOD MONGOLIA broke sharply, was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the backstretch, held sway on a narrow margin into upper stretch and
maintained that advantage to the end under firm right handed pressure. WEEKEND PASS, reserved last well off the field to the far turn, swung out five wide
in upper stretch and rallied willingly in that path to close the gap on the winner while edging a rival for the place honors at the wire. IMAGINE GOLD,
forwardly placed three deep in second flight racing to the backstretch, advanced to prompt the leader through the far turn into upper stretch but was
outkicked by that rival then lost second at the wire. SPENDER was rated off the second flight near the inside racing to the backstretch, was prompted to
advance nearing upper stretch, altered course entering the lane to split foes just off the inside but had no late kick. SINGING ALLI settled off the second
flight outside a rival in the opening half, angled out four wide racing into upper stretch but lacked a rally. DARING DAMSEL tracked the pacesetter between
foes in second flight and emptied out racing into the far turn. PRESENT OF HERO tracked the leader inside rivals as part of the second flight from the
outset to the far turn and faded nearing upper stretch.
