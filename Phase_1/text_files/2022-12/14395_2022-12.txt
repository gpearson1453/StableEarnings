Footnotes
WOODS HOLE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the three path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and held
that margin to the wire. KENYA SUN chased the leaders on the inside through the opening three furlongs, raced in the two path around the turn, began a
bid approaching the quarter pole and kept on to the finish. CSILLA raced off the pace between horses up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two
path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch. KNIGHT SLEEPER was brushed lightly by the horse to her inside at the start,
recovered to duel between horses up the backstretch, battled while saving ground around the far turn and weakened in the final furlong. SASSY LIKE JULIA
pressed the pace on the inside in the early going, gave way while saving ground around the turn and finished evenly. MARKET OF STOCKS raced at the
back of the pack on the inside in the opening stages, saved ground around the turn and passed tiring horses in the lane. TIZ LOTTIE trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there. BELLSWILLBERINGING stalked the
pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and faded in the stretch. FANCYSOUL hit the gate and bumped with
the horse to her inside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and made no bid.
PLATINUMCENTS settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and tired in the
stretch.
