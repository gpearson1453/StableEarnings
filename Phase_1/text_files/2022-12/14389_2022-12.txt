Footnotes
OJITOS BELLOS drifted out leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, swung to the five path approaching the eighth pole, closed outside
horses and led late. LADY LANCER , three deep on the turn while chasing the pace, bid for the lead late and finished gamely. ICESTORMING saved
ground around the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and lacked the necessary late response. SINGING THE OLDIES , bumped and caught
in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, hugged the inner rail around the turn, drifted to the two path in upper stretch and weakened
late. WILLFUL DESIRE prompted the pace two wide around the turn, remained in contention to mid stretch and gave way late. LA TACHE , never a factor,
was five deep leaving the turn. EXCLUSIVE ROSE , outrun, raced along the inner rail around the turn.

Footnotes
DIVINE LAW rated kindly while in the clear and off of a contested early pace, angled out early turn and advanced four wide past the five sixteenths,
sustained under pressure while exchanging bumps in mid stretch, took a short lead outside foes with a sixteenth remaining and dug in under a drive to
prove best. PRACTICAL SENSE saved ground while not far back and under some coaxing, gained along the rail heading towards the stretch, eased out
and bumped with the winner near the eighth pole, challenged between rivals a sixteenth later, kept on gamely inside the winner but wasn't quite good
enough. LASSMAN pulled to the inside of foes and took a short early lead, edged clear into the turn then set a rated pace, kept on while under pressure and
off the inside past the three sixteenths, dug in when confronted by the top pair, fought on past the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly.
VOTETHEMALLOUT broke slowly then steadied soon after, raced well back into the turn, saved ground gathering steam into the stretch and finished
strongly. STORIED FELLA , four deep nearing the half mile marker, dropped in a bit and rated between rivals mid turn, angled back out for the drive and
churned on. QUINCANNON , between rivals early, dropped back leaving the far turn, swung out six wide for the stretch run and had belated interest.
MOSLER SAFE , three wide between foes early, was lightly steadied out of a tight spot mid turn, angled out but lacked a serious finish. STRONGER THAN
DEX , with the pace three deep, failed to kick on under asking into the lane, drifted in and steadied soon after then gave way. PRESSING CONCERN , with
the early pace between runners, pressed two wide outside the leader mid turn then gave way leaving the three sixteenths.

ground on the turn while taking outside pressure then gradually drew off through the stretch while kept to his business. GENERAL J R , bumped leaving the
starting gate, race in the to path on the turn and in upper stretch, was taken to the inner rail in mid stretch and rallied. HOP AND SCOTCH , unhurried down
the backstretch, circled horses four deep on the turn, floated to the six path turning for home, advanced outside foes to the eighth pole then flattened out.
IMPETUD prompted the pace outside the winner to mid stretch, weakened and his rider briefly eased up inside the sixteenth pole when appearing to mis
judge the finish. DAREDAVITE , no factor, raced wide on the turn, entered the stretch in the seven path, floated to the eight path near the eighth pole and
failed to fire. ANNIESALLINCLUSIVE bumped GENERAL J R when bearing out at the break, hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung outside near the
sixteenth pole and passed tired rivals. LOVE TALK stumbled at the break, raced in the two path leaving the backstretch and gave way on the turn. HE'S ON
FIRE chased the pace to the stretch and gave way. WILDERZAR , bumped leaving the starting gate, raced along the inner rail most of the trip and faltered.

Footnotes
THORNY TALE tracked inside, was coaxed along as a duel developed near the five sixteenths, came out for room soon after, straightened to be four wide
for the drive, closed in under left handed asking to put a head in front with a furlong to go, steadily kicked away and was kept alert to the wire. PLAMEN
prompted the pace outside MOTAGALLY, drew alongside leaving the three eighths, dueled and wrested a slim advantage entering the stretch, held that
lead to about mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MOTAGALLY sped to the front, set the pace towards the rail, dug in when PLAMEN engaged, sparred
to mid stretch then faded. BOBBY G settled off the pace and outside a rival, came under pressure around the final turn, swung out but lacked a serious bid.
BUSTOFF stalked three wide under some rating, remained in touched while asked past the three eighths, shifted four wide approaching the stretch, lacked
a punch from there and gave way. GOLDINI broke a step slow, saved ground off the pace and faded.

upper stretch then drew out. SECRET SANCTUARY prompted the pace outside foes down the backstretch, sprinted clear entering the far turn, raced near
the inner rail and gave way grudgingly. VOICE OF NOW stalked the pace down the backstretch, was three wide on the far turn, offered a mild move in
upper stretch and weakened late. POSITRACTION lacked speed, was well off the inner rail in upper stretch and drifted in near the eighth pole. HAY
DIDDLE DIDDLE stumbled when bumped by MAYBE IT'S TIME and forced into BOOKER T leaving the starting gate, raced inside horses most of the trip
and weakened. MR. FIBONACCI , no factor, was five deep turning for home. STEADY EDDIE showed speed along the inner rail and gave way on the far
turn. BYRON'S GOLD outrun, raced six deep entering the stretch. MAYBE IT'S TIME bore out leaving the starting gate, showed speed inside, faltered on
the far turn and was eased late. OBOY , four wide the first turn, faltered. BOOKER T , soundly bumped at the start, trailed.

RAISE YOUR GAME , well back early, was sent up between rivals leaving the far turn, continued progress between rivals nearing the lane, swung out four
wide in upper stretch, leveled off under right handed asking through the final furlong and surged outside runners to be up in the final jumps. SPEAK YOUR
MIND quickly went clear and set a rated pace towards the rail, moved away without much asking mid turn, came under a ride soon into the lane, remained
well clear past mid stretch but just failed to last. PRAY FOR THE U S A was sent up early and chased the leader, shifted out some for the drive and closed
steadily between rivals. QUEEN OF CLASS saved ground advancing into the lane, angled out and kept on with effort while between foes late. HARPER'S
DO dropped off the early pace, was under pressure mid turn, swung well wide but lacked a solid finish. LADY WHISTLEDOWN , four to five wide, came up
empty. CAMELIA ROD saved ground and was eased late. MARTHARITA broke slowly, raced four to five wide mid turn and failed to menace. MISS
REMMIA , three to four wide nearing the turn, was outrun. STRUTTIN gave early chase three wide outside PRAY FOR THE U S A, failed to kick on past the
five sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
KARAN'S NOTION stalked the leader two wide, eased out a path for the drive, made a grinding run under left handed asking, took command between rivals
in the final jump or two and prevailed. THREES OVER DEUCES rated off of the winner leaving the five eighths, came under pressure around the turn,
angled out advancing into the lane, bid between runners to take a slim lead in deep stretch, stayed gamely but just missed. GOING TO THE LEAD broke
slowly, rushed up soon after and stalked outside a rival, angled four wide in upper stretch and closed well. EXCULPATORY displayed sharp speed and went
clear early, dropped in and secured the rail, dug in when confronted near the sixteenth marker and gave way grudgingly. INDIAN LAKE , off the early pace,
eased out some and moved up four wide past the five sixteenths, angled wider for the drive and slowly gained. GOLDEN CANDY lacked speed off the rail,
failed to kick on around the turn, faltered soon into the lane, was eased through the final furlong and walked off. An objection by the rider of THREES OVER
DEUCES against the winner for alleged interference through the backstretch run was not allowed

ROMINSKI sprinted to the early lead, opened up on the turn and was under urging in the drive. BACKATYA showed speed along the inner rail, failed to
keep up with the winner on the turn then gamely chased that one through the stretch. KNOWHOWIKNOW chased the pace, was three wide entering the
strecth and gave way. LOOKIN FOR JUSTICE lacked speed, saved ground around the turn, eased out in upper stretch and failed to be a factor. VIRGINIA
FULLA , outrun, was in the four path entering the stretch. BOURBON OVER ICE gave way on the turn. PANNA MINE was outrun. AXXERATOR , fractious
in the starting gate, was outrun. HEADS OR TAILS , four wide leaving the turn, gave way in upper stretch, was eased and walked off.
