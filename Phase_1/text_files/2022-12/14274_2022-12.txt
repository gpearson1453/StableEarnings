Footnotes
SO BREANNA stalked four wide behind the contesting foursome into the turn, offered a strong bid between rivals five wide at the quarter marker, took over
control at the eighth pole and drew off easily for the victory. FIRE EMOJI trailed the pack while unhurried down the backside, was ridden to go on six wide
wide two furlongs remaining, closed belatedly widest through the the stretch and finished up well besting the rest at the finish. MISS SCHILLER broke sharp
and was taken back inside to watch the four early speedsters do battle, waited behind runners through the turn, looked for a path at the top of the stretch,
angled out at the eighth pole to finally get clear running room and finished up well to capture third. COSMIC SHOT engaged between rivals three wide
racing on the turn, was in hunt with runners on either side in upper stretch and determinedly fought on the garner a minor share at the finish. WANT TO GO
DANCING contested four wide for the lead running on the turn, was in contention between challengers in mid stretch and stalled at the furlong marker losing
positions nearing the wire. SHES LOADED pressed the issue on the rail down the backstretch, assumed command three furlongs from the prize, was
collared by runners outside at the furlong marker, offered little resistance and weakened in deep stretch. BAYSVILLE had a mild lead over three other
challengers with a half remaining, was the first to give way in the pace scenario midpoint on the turn and retreated on the fence at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
KATCHY NAME moved forward inside and was clear past the five-eighths to set the pace, drifted out leaving the turn, held a foe at bay. ZONING ORDER
had brief foot between runners, continued forwardly-positioned tracking in behind, came into upper stretch inside, switched outside the leader past the
eighth, made slow steady progress that was not enough but was second best. SMOKEN CHLOE raced off the early pace, went four wide on the turn, got up
for show inside SILENT TRIBUTE, who was prominent early then pursued the pace from outside three to four wide, drifted out in upper stretch, needed
more. LIPLOCK was forwardly-positioned three wide early but a bit erratic, chased in behind, ran on evenly. TACHYON SPEED raced outside mid-pack
early, went four to five wide on the turn while between runners, came out seven wide into upper stretch and ran on evenly. BE LIKE LEIGH lacked early
speed racing two wide, shifted inside a foe at the top of the stretch and ran on. HOLIDAY WITH AMY was encouraged along inside on the turn, came out at
the top of the stretch, failed to rally. SENSATIONAL SARAH advanced mildly outside five to six wide on the turn, came into upper stretch eight deep, had no
late bid. CRUMLIN BEAST was encouraged along five wide into the turn but never a factor.

Footnotes
SAN NICOLA STAR had a good tracking position on the rail down the backside, waited behind the early frontrunners on the final turn, shifted out three wide
at the quarter pole to commence her run and wore down the leader through the stretch to get up for the victory nearing the wire in a well timed finish. LADY
MAEVE (IRE) settled comfortably near the rear running down the backside, circled the field with a bold run three wide starting at the three eighths marker,
took command at the quarter pole to open up in upper stretch and while racing on the wrong lead began to get leg weary through the lane was caught
nearing the wire. AWILDAS TREASURE stumbled at the start to trail in the beginning, advanced smartly up the rail three furlongs from the prize, rallied
shifting off tiring leaders three wide at the quarter pole, split foes entering the stretch drive and finished well inside to win the battle for show. MIA'S
AUTHORITY was under a snug hold on the first turn and backside tracking the leaders, three furlongs from the finish was shuffled back a few positions
travelling on the far turn, regrouped five wide two furlongs out and finished with interest to settle on the fringes in the end. IVY'S STAR settled near the back
in the early stages, trailed the field running on the far turn, angled out widest for the stretch drive and passed tired runners down the lane. MORE SAVVY
travelled outside in the middle of the pack racing down the backstretch, offered a mild run with three furlongs from the finish to be in contention midway on
the final turn, gave way at the top of the stretch and made little impression running to the wire. BELLA NINA dictated the pace in the early stages, was
headed outside midpoint on the second turn, offered little resistance and retreated on the fence down the lane. REIGN BY REIN chased the frontrunner in
the beginning, forced the pace scenario at the half mile marker, briefly was in front midway on the far turn, and faltered between horses in the stretch to be a

Footnotes
HATMAKER HOLIDAY moved forward inside rivals to quickly take command and dictate the pace facing moderate pressure by an outside rival, moved
clear turning for home and coming out a bit, held sway. SUPER LUNAR settled inside through the turn, came out three wide in upper stretch, rallied inside
foes to get up for place but could not reach the winner. MRS. DEL broke on top but was soon overtaken, pursued the pace three to four wide, kept on in the
stretch to get up for show honors over SPARKLE SAMMY, who moved forward to press the eventual winner two to three wide, lost ground turning for home,
kept on evenly in the stretch but was outfinished for the minor placings. EVER SO D'WILD tracked from inside, ran evenly and made no bid. NORTHERN
RUBY bobbled slightly at the start, raced four to five wide on the turn, was not a threat. SASSY MARTINI was encouraged along four to five wide on the
turn, came out a bit further at the top of the stretch, failed to menace. TAKE IT EASY switched out early, raced two to three wide between foes on the turn,
steadied slightly in upper stretch as a rival came out.

Footnotes
JAMIESTA broke sharp to be up front in the beginning, cleared the field outside nearing the turn to lead comfortably on the rail with five sixteenths to go,
repelled a mild threat in upper stretch and when asked drew away convincingly late for a powerful win. DO THE GRIDDY advanced up the rail to track the
frontrunner with three eighths remaining, shifted out midpoint on the turn to loom outside at the top of the lane, could not quicken with the loose pacesetter
in upper stretch and held place at the wire while tiring chasing the winner through to the finish line. PIDIN took off the contesting pace at the half, shifted
inwards saving ground into the turn, slipped up the fence at the top of the stretch, angled out three wide under left handed urging and just missed out closing
in for the place award. I'M NO SLEEPY JOE was unhurried to trail down the backside, travelled inside through the turn, split runners four wide at the quarter
pole, was floated out to the six path for the drive and showed late energy to get up for a minor role. GREEN AMAZON was void of early speed in the
beginning, travelled near the rear throughout the turn, roused three wide two furlongs to the wire, angled out five wide for the drive and passed tired runners
down the lane. IT'S ME MARIO was ridden down the backstretch to keep position close to the leaders, asked for more run on the turn, offered little effort
with a quarter to go and faltered between foes in mid stretch. FRANKS RELOAD pressed four wide at the half mile marker, was nudged along for more run
three furlongs from home, offered a brief run to contend for a small share at the top of the lane and tired with a furlong remaining. SAKE AND SUSHI was
hustled between horses early on, could not keep pace with rivals on either side into the turn, retreated while under a ride at the five sixteenths marker and
was not involved through the lane.

Footnotes
CANADIANSWEETHEART advanced outside five wide on the turn coming six to seven deep into upper stretch, bid at the eighth pole, dueled briefly then
edged away under stout urging. SIXTH ANNIVERSARY shifted in heading up the backstretch, came out turning for home with aim five wide in upper stretch,
bid a furlong out, dueled briefly but was outfinished. GOLDEN TRAIN was urged at the break to move forward inside, moved clear to set the pace racing just
off the rail, was no match for the top pair. SILVER SIGN raced outside fanning seven to eight into upper stretch, improved position for the minor award.
FOREST MAIDEN pursued the pace three wide, urged along between runners on the turn, weakened. MORE GELATO chased from between runners about
four wide, ridden along on the turn while dropping back, swung out six to seven wide turning for home, needed more. A GAL FOR T J moved in a bit early,
raced near but off the rail on the turn, moved to the rail late on that bend, failed to menace. QUIET MADDELENA chased four wide, steadied slightly in
upper stretch, was not persevered with late and walked off.

Footnotes
BLAZING SKY stalked four wide running down the backside, rallied outside rivals gaining on runners throughout the turn, angled out seven wide for the
stretch drive and found her best stride late to edge away for the win in deep stretch. IMA DAREDEVIL stalked in the three path in the early stages, waited
behind horses five sixteenths from the line, shifted just inside to find a seam three off the fence turning for home and determinedly rallied between runners
the last eighth to be a clear second. ONEZY'S DREAM was off poorly to begin, chased between challengers on the turn, loomed four wide in upper stretch
and stalled the final sixteenth to settle for the show award in the end. SILENT GUROO took command racing well off the rail down the backside, continued
to dictate the pace on the turn, repelled a mild challenge inside at the top of the lane, was collared on either side at the sixteenth pole and faded in deep
stretch to hold on for a minor share. FRESH DREAMS trailed the field in the beginning, advanced inside nearing the half, chased the frontrunner on the rail
through the turn, threatened for the top spot in upper stretch and tired at the furlong marker. TEACHER'S PET settled near the rear down the backside,
lacked clear running room inside throughout the turn, tried to rally up the fence at the top of the lane and could not make an impact running to the wire.
ORBALINE pressed between foes leaving the chute, tracked three wide down the backstretch, was ridden between rivals midway on the turn to keep
position, offered little run and yielded in upper stretch. BLU SKY SUNRISE tracked three wide early on, was shuffled back five wide to be near the rear at
the half, lost contact with the field racing on the turn and was not persevered with through the lane.

Footnotes
FOREST B contested the pace from off the inside, moved clear of rivals racing in the two path into the turn, widened in upper stretch, held while being kept
to the task. CREEMORE moved out from four to six wide turning for home, was gaining but too late. CEDAR VALLEY advanced outside four to five wide on
the turn coming seven deep into upper stretch, loomed a threat but evened out. BODACIOUS MISS raced off the leaders three wide into the turn, passed a
rival outside and was gaining mildly in late stretch near the inside. ARTFUL BALLERINA stalked off the eventual winner three to four wide, flattened out.
SASSYWITHATTITUDE had brief speed contesting the pace inside the eventual winner but off the rail, steadily weakened. SPEEDY LYNN was urged
strongly in the early going to move forward inside, chased just off the leader, came up empty. J M R BOLD VISION raced near the rail and was not a factor.
TOUCH OF ROUGE was toward the rear off the rail, swung five wide, was not a threat.
