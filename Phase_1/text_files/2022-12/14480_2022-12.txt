Footnotes
BOLD REY pressed the pace of FOR LOVE NOT MONEY while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off as a handy winner.
BORN TO REIGN showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but finished with good energy
to gain the place. MISSCZECH pressed the pace from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. FOR LOVE NOT MONEY
was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MIDNIGHT GARDEN was off a step slow, chased
the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going five furlongs. SUNDANCE STAR raced six-wide through the first turn, lacked early foot, saved
ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid. RED PANTY NIGHT settled off the leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. SEVEN
POINTS showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

NOTACRY tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, responded to steady urging and was up in the closing yards. SWEET SAVANT
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further with a sixteenth to run and rallied late. INCREDIBE
MO pressed the pace LITTLE RED RIFLE while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the five-sixteenths marker, opened a clear margin
into the lane and gave way late. ROYAL AIR FORCE settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with a late bid.
LITTLE RED RIFLE was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way after going three-quarters. COUSIN MARK lacked early
foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and did not menace. BUSTER BURNS showed brief speed and weakened. MEGA MEAT settled off the
leaders from the inside throughout and failed to rally. TAP THE BANK lacked early speed, saved ground through the second turn, drifted out nearing the
sixteenth pole and did not offer a bid. CHIEF GOVERNOR was off slow, showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, drifted out nearing
the sixteenth pole and did not reach contention. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

BUMPY CUP sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace and held sway to the wire. ATTORNEY LOUIS tracked the leaders from the inside,
angled out into the stretch and failed to gain on the winner in the drive. YOU'RE MY BOY KAT broke sharply to chase the leaders while racing three-wide
throughout and lacked the needed closing response. ABERDEEN'S KNIGHT settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished
evenly late. SARGE'S SERMON was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. MANFORALLSEASONS raced
off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. FLYING WINCHESTER
chased the leaders while racing four-wide, drifted out nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. GEBO raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn and weakened. DEPUTY KNIGHT was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. JOE DID IT was off slow
and lagged throughout.

Footnotes
DAZZLING MIST broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter and held off the closing CRIMINAL
RECORD to prevail. CRIMINAL RECORD was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. PALACE
STAR was never far back, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. HOLLYWOOD MISTRESS lacked early foot, raced five-wide
through the turn and finished with some late run. SUMMEROFTHESAMURAI pressed the pace while racing three-wide and gave way through the final
furlong. CONVINCE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished evenly. ATLANTIC PRINCESS raced off the pacesetters
early, saved ground through the turn and gradually gave way. ABBIE'S WAY lacked early foot, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. LE TUB
was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. MCGOLDIE bobbled at the break, raced unhurried early, moved four-wide
through the turn and did not threaten.

and was gaining on the winner late. COASTAL WATERS was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn and finished with good late
energy. JOKER MATT was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn, raced between foes through the land was failed to gain late.
BOSS NINE pressed the pace while racing four-wide and gave way after going three-quarters. ETU BABOU showed no early speed, raced four-wide
through the second turn and was not a factor. SECRET POTION settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, angled out further in
