Footnotes
RESPOND was herded out by WESLAN in the opening strides, chased outside that foe early, took closer order approaching the half, bid four wide on the
turn and loomed approaching the quarter, came four wide into the lane, kept on with good interest despite LIGHTNING CASHES clearing back off,
reengaged outside that foe in the final sixteenth and got the nod. LIGHTNING CASHES was reluctant to load, sent for speed, led down the back straight and
while positioned two wide on the turn, continued on a narrow lead as SOVIET STANDARD and RESPOND bid to his outside, opened up again midstretch,
was reengaged by RESPOND to his outside in the final sixteenth and lost the bob. MAN ON ATTACK broke a bit awkwardly, raced keenly behind the leader
and inside of SOVIET STANDARD early, saved ground in the pocket on the turn, bid inside of RESPOND in upper stretch, proved no match approaching
midstretch and flattened late while still holding safe for the show. RUSSIAN HAMMER was stubborn in the post parade, broke a step slow and soon trailed,
saved ground on the turn, began to take closer order approaching the quarter pole, and closed well under a mild hand ride. WESLAN broke outward and
carried RESPOND out in the opening strides, chased inside that foe early, raced well off the leaders in the four to five path on the turn, swung five wide into
the lane and lacked the needed late kick. SOVIET STANDARD tracked the leader outside of MAN ON ATTACK early, engaged outside of RESPOND while
racing three wide on the turn, came three wide into the lane and emptied out from upper stretch. INDIO GUAPO was pushed along near the rear down the
back straight, raced in the six to seven path on the turn, came six wide into the lane and offered no bid.

Footnotes
MOVE ON OVER ducked outwards a bit at the start, quickly recovered to gain a forward placing prompting the pacesetter through the backstretch into the
turn, took over racing through upper stretch, then held TWO WORLDS safe to the end under firm handling and a few right handed taps. The latter tracked
just off the leaders between foes through the backstretch, shifted out three wide nearing upper stretch and continued with a steady effort to close the gap on
the winner while never gaining even terms with that rival. CHRISTMAS PRESENT tracked just off the leaders inside foes racing through the backstretch,
saved ground to upper stretch and continued with interest along the rail to edge rivals for a share in the closing stages. JUST RIGHT MIKE broke inwards
crossing into the path of GEMO RAIN, was urged to the lead setting the pace on a narrow advantage along the inside racing into the bend, dueled for
command inside the winner into upper stretch and gave way leaving the furlong marker. IMPERIAL MOMENT switched outside foes after the opening
furlong to track the leaders three deep as part of the second flight racing to the turn, was fanned four wide nearing upper stretch and lacked the needed final
kick. IRISH TUFF, caught in tight quarters, then squeezed back at the start, settled last on the backstretch and never gained contention. GEMO RAIN
delayed proceedings when requiring a shoe repair in the paddock, was carried in at the start crossing into the path of IRISH TUFF, was collected to track off
the second flight on the backstretch and faded early.

Footnotes
D'FEVER was hustled hard between horses early, took the lead approaching the five eighths, cleared, saved ground around the turn, and held safe to the
finish while kept to task. RISKY BOY settled toward the rear inside of DEVIL'S RULE, continued near the rear in the three path on the turn, came two wide
into the lane, shifted out a few paths while improving position, kept on to capture the place near the sixteenth mark and chased on with good interest to the
finish. KING TITO tracked the leading pair down the back straight, continued to track the pacesetter in the three path on the turn, chased while no match for
D'FEVER into upper stretch, and kept on evenly while drifting out. DEVIL'S RULE broke sharply but settled back to chased toward the rear outside RISKY
BOY, chased in the five to six path on the turn, was driven in the five path in upper stretch, drifted inward in upper stretch despite a left-handed crop, and
kept on mildly. RICHIESGOTSWAGGER broke sharply but soon settled back last, took slightly closer order in the six path on the turn, raced in the six path
into the lane, and finished mildly past tiring horses. AGAVE KID tracked the early pace inside of KING TITO, chased between horses in the four path on the
turn, came into the lane in the five path and flattened out. PRINCE OF MAYHEM was sent for pace inside, found himself outsprinted by D'FEVER from near
the five eighths, tracked the leader down the rest of the back straight, gradually faded inside around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch and came up
empty.

Footnotes
PALACE MAGIC was urged to gain terms with a rival attending the pace under light rating racing through the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper
stretch to gain a narrow advantage racing past the furlong marker and edged clear late under firm left handed encouragement. SHEZA SAVAGE broke
readily, took up a position off the first flight stalking those rivals under light rating outside a rival racing to the turn, tipped out three wide racing into upper
stretch while being prompted to advance and edged a rival for the place honors late. RAP STAR was urged to the lead while angling to the inside in the
opening stages, dictated the pace on a narrow margin racing into the turn, dueled for command inside the winner past midstretch but weakened nearing the
sixteenth marker. KHOZYS CROWN angled to the inside tracking off the leaders in second flight racing into the bend, tipped off the inside racing into upper
stretch but offered no rally. ROCK THE BIRDHOUSE was settled off the second flight along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground to
upper stretch but lacked a rally. SNOOTY broke in the air, then stumbled at the start losing position to the field and never regained contention.

outside, kicked clear in upper stretch, was shown the crop in midstretch, felt it just twice, and kept on clear under a hand ride the rest of the way. STORMIN

wide in the leading line down the backstretch, prompted the pace outside of DARK HEDGES around the turn while racing in the three path, proved no match

the backstretch while being pushed along to keep up, weakened three wide around the turn, floated six wide into the lane and offered no more.

ROCKET HOTSHOT broke outwards making light contact with SKIP AWAY CARTER at the start, was reserved inside rivals in the last flight racing to the
backstretch, saved ground racing into the far turn gradually drawing into contention inside foes nearing upper stretch, tipped out in upper stretch to advance
three deep between foes and responded to firm encouragement to prevail in time. WILDWOOD'S WARRIOR was urged to the lead along the inside
dictating the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, edged clear momentarily racing through the far turn, dueled for command into upper stretch
but couldn't contain the winner's late bid. BUREAU pulled against firm rating racing just off the leaders into the first turn, angled to the rail midway through
the backstretch while being prompted to advance, came through inside a rival nearing upper stretch, then shifted out to challenge the pacesetter entering
the lane but flattened out in late stages. KEEN RESPONSE was settled last to the backstretch, shifted outside foes, advanced on the leaders four wide
racing through the far turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch but continued with an effort to gain some position. SKIP AWAY CARTER, bumped at the
start, was urged to terms with the pacesetter between foes racing in close quarters into the first turn, angled to the inside on the backstretch tracking just off
the leaders to the far turn, shifted out racing into the lane while being prompted to advance but had no late response. STORM BORN was urged to gain
terms with the pacesetter three deep between foes while caught in tight quarters racing into the first turn, shifted in nearing the backstretch to prompt the
pacesetter to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. FLEET OF HOOF was urged to join the pace four wide racing into the first turn, then dropped off
the leaders to track those foes outside a rival in second flight to the second bend, was urged to lodge a brief bid three deep between foes nearing upper
stretch but steadily faded in the drive. WATCHNTHEGIRLSGOBY settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and retreated to late into
the far turn.

Footnotes
MISTER CHARMING tracked the leading pair, continued in range of them while racing in the two to three path on the far turn, rallied between horses in
upper stretch, led just past the three sixteenths, drove clear from midstretch and drifted out late while clear. ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS chased near the
rear two wide around the clubhouse turn, was a bit keen to midfield inside of DEMAND RANSOM into the back straight, chased on from there, was pushed
along in the three to four path on the far turn, swung six wide into upper stretch, kept on willingly and wrested the place late. ASTI SKY was restless in the
gate, broke sharply outside of SUPRISE CAT, prompted the pace outside that foe around the far turn, vied with that foe down the back straight, began to
edge past him in the three path past the seven sixteenths, came three wide into the lane, was headed from the inside by MISTER CHARMING near the
three sixteenths, proved no match in the final furlong and lost the place late. FLASHY RICHIE raced three wide at the rear around the first turn, continued
outside COMING UP ACES at the rear into the back straight, continued near the rear in the four path on the far turn, was driven into the lane, angled inward,
and kept on mildly. COMING UP ACES chased inside around the clubhouse turn, settled back into the backstretch to race at the inside of the rear flight,
chased midpack around the far turn in the two path, came four wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed stretch kick. SUPRISE CAT set the early pace
inside while prompted by ASTI SKY, vied inside that foe down the backstretch while racing keenly, was no match for ASTI SKY from near the seven
sixteenths, tracked while saving ground, and weakened from upper stretch. DEMAND RANSOM chased three wide around the clubhouse turn, gradually
lost position outside down the back straight, had no response when pushed along in the six path on the far turn and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
COOKIN ROSES broke sharply to gain the advantage outside foes, angled inwards setting the pace just off the inside racing into the bend, held sway into
upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure to maintain a safe advantage. FIRST SQUADRON was urged between foes to gain a position just
inside the pacesetter prompting that rival on the backstretch, tracked the leader along the inside racing into the bend, tipped out racing into upper stretch
while being roused to advance and proved best of the others while no match for the winner. SUPERSTAR DIVA, forwardly placed between foes in the
opening stages, shifted out three wide racing into the bend, then continued evenly in that path through late stages to prevail for a share. HEY HEY tracked
just off the leaders racing four wide into the turn, then continued evenly in that path through late stages. WANNA HAVE FUN settled inside foes racing
through the backstretch, saved ground to upper stretch and continued evenly while gaining some position late. GODSGIFT tracked off the second flight
while shifting out racing into the turn, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and offered no rally. PRINCESS CONSUELA threw her head just before the
break, then stumbled at the start, settled into stride racing to the turn and never gained contention. B N A NATIVE GIRL dropped out of contention early. AH
LEAH broke awkwardly, was switched outside foes to race four wide into the turn, shifted inwards racing into upper stretch but quickly emptied out.
