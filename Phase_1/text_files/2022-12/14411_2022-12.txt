Footnotes
MORSTACHY'S was allowed to settle inside down the backstretch, began to advance on the rail midpoint on the turn, rallied between rivals at the quarter
pole splitting horses in the three path at the top of the lane and wore down the leader in the final sixteenths for the win. TASTE MY CANDY took command
from the start, comfortably set the fractions running on the turn, was on the wrong lead through the lane and was collared by the eventual winner in deep
stretch. GRAND AMBITION chased three wide at the half, was urged to go after the pacesetter two furlongs from the line, could not gain in upper stretch
and was one paced to the finish holding for show. WILD CONVERSATION chased between runners in the early part of the race, could not match strides
with the top two through the turn and ran evenly through the stretch to settle on the fringes. GREEN AMAZON was situated near the back of the field on the
rail at the half, made little impression saving ground racing throughout the turn and showed some late interest to win a minor battle for a small share of the
prize at the wire. ARNIE P travelled in the two path trailing the field in the early stages, put in a mild charge three wide on the turn and passed tiring
challengers outside in the five path at the top of the stretch. SEATTLE DOWN UNDER was alone in the middle of the pack patiently tracking the leaders,
offered a brief run midway on the turn to contend for a piece of the prize turning for home and faded in upper stretch. BEYOND TALENTED settled near the
rear just off the fence down the backside, was scrubbed on for more run three furlongs from the finish, little effort was given and gave way with runners on
either side at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
BOLD RELOAD set the pace two to three wide with inside pressure from a rival, kicked clear when asked, was kept busy through the stretch and held well.
FIRE EMOJI shifted in heading to the turn, went two to three wide on that bend in behind the leaders, drifted a bit in the stretch, could not gain on the winner
but was second best. SPANISH PRINCE shifted in, saved ground on the turn, kept on in the stretch and got the nod for show over. MIA AND ME , who
raced mid-pack and between runners early, went four wide on the turn coming into upper stretch about five to six wide, ran on but missed show.
SETTEBELLO shifted in early, moved out a path into the turn and was ridden along going two wide, came out four wide at the top of the stretch, needed
more. I LIVE BY FAITH lacked early speed, raced five wide on the turn, swung seven to eight deep into upper stretch then drifted out a bit more, improved
position. NGABE raced off the pace three wide on the turn, angled seven wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit and ran on. BAYSVILLE chased outside
mid-pack, went four to five wide on the turn, weakened. STRIKING SOCIETY stalked the leading pair three wide, had no response and failed to rally.
QUICK RELOAD dwelt at the start spotting the field about six lengths, moved forward inside heading to the turn, came up empty. INFINITELY KATZ
pressed the winner from inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
LAPOCHKA was allowed to settle patiently between foes at the rear down the backside, rated kindly behind the leaders into the turn waiting for room, found
a seam inside two furlongs from the wire, had dead aim on the pacesetter as they turned for home and took control at the furlong pole to edge away for the
win at the finish. LAST AMERICAN EXIT kept close range to the frontrunner racing inside down the backstretch, crept up the rail to assume command three
eighths from the wire, opened up briefly on the field at the quarter pole, was headed outside by the closing winner at the furlong marker and gave way in
deep stretch. HYPERFOCUS trailed the field at the break, took closer order in the three path outside runners at the half, when urged midway on the turn,
began circling horses to be five wide at the top of the lane and put in a good closing stretch finish to get up for the show award. RON'S GIZMO tracked three
wide just behind a soft early pace, was urged three wide to keep position outside throughout the turn, could not stay involved with the leaders and was one
paced to the finish for a minor role. EPILOGUE was unhurried on the rail to be at the back in this tightly bunched field at the half mile marker, advanced
mildly on the fence with three furlongs remaining to the finish, and could not find another gear in upper stretch to make an impact to the wire. UNCLE BULL
broke sharp to take this compact field down the backstretch, surrendered the lead to an inside rival with three eighths remaining, was roused to keep up with
the frontrunner midpoint on the turn, offered little response and retreated between runners at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
LOIS LEN moved clear early to set the pace racing near the inside, faced some pressure from outside, turned back those challengers and drew away again
and was kept to the task late. SYSTEMATIC switched outside a rival, went two wide moving out four wide late on the turn, rallied between runners in
mid-stretch, was second best. SILVER DAHLIA stalked from outside, drew within striking distance four to five wide coming to the quarter pole but had no
extra. WINYAH BAY settled into stride off the pace, dropped back a bit on the turn racing in the four path, swung nine wide into the stretch and gained
outside. LOADED QUESTION shifted in, tracked from inside, came out three wide at the top of the stretch and looming a threat but evened out. HENRY'S
GAMBLE lacked speed bringing up the rear racing off the rail through the turn, gained mildly near inside in the stretch. OLD SECRETS raced evenly along
the inside and made no bid. LINCOLNVILLE BEACH pursued from between runners three to four wide, floated five to six wide into upper stretch, lacked the
needed late kick. SIMPLE SOUVENIR raced outside off the pace going five to seven wide on the turn, failed to menace. OHEAVENS raced mid-pack four to
six wide, failed to rally. A MAIZE ZING DOTIE rated off the pace of the eventual winner early, moved closer to press from outside three wide, faltered and
faded.

Footnotes
SOUPED UP broke inwards to start, chased the frontrunner down the backside, continued to have his sights set on the leader keeping in range through the
turn, bid outside for the lead at the quarter pole, took control at the furlong marker and won going away at the wire. BIG RANSOM broke outwards at the
break, set the fractions down the backstretch, dictated the pace on the turn, was collared outside by the winner two furlongs from the line, battled for an
eighth and gave way in deep stretch. PREETZAH'S STAR tracked outside three deep at the half, was in range outside watching the leaders racing through
the turn, contended three wide turning for home, chased the top two to no avail down the lane and settled for a clear third in the end. DEFOGGER was
squeezed at th start, settled in midfield stalking three wide with a half to go, offered a mild run five sixteenths from the finish and was kept to the task in the
stretch to get up for a minor role in the end. MIA'S LIL ANGEL had a good spot sitting behind the trio of leaders at the half, waited on the turn for running
room, angled inwards at the furlong marker for a clear path and jumped shadows in deep stretch losing a placing. IT'S A FLUKE made an early move on the
rail to get inside position entering the turn, in tight quarters with three eighths to run was checked, lost momentum and could not get involved running
through the stretch. SEATTLE APPEAL settled near the rear in the early stages, was ridden to keep up with contenders on the turn, had little to give and
was not a presence through the lane. FIRST ROUND was uninterested running down the backstretch to trail, was urged to get involved at the half mile
marker, lost touch with the field on the turn and galloped to the wire.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT IN MALIBU broke a half-step slowly, moved forward from between runners two to three wide racing just off the pace through the first turn,
continued to stalk three then four wide on the far turn, bid in mid-stretch outside runners, dueled briefly then edged away. HEY CUE was rank while being
taken back off the early pace steadying slightly a couple times and racing inside, switched out off the rail, stalked in behind coming three wide to the
midpoint of the far turn, bid between runners in mid-stretch, could not match strides with the winner but got the nod for place over SAMMY STONE, who
broke a bit awkwardly, settled off the pace, advanced along the rail heading up the backstretch to the far turn, came out a bit in upper stretch, bid inside the
aforementioned two rivals but was outfinished. COHERENCE shifted in to the two to three path heading into the first turn, moved nearer inside and
advanced heading to the far turn, saved ground on that bend on or just off the rail, was within striking distance in upper stretch inside, angled out past the
eighth pole and ran on to just hold the minor award over LANIGAN, who was caught four to five wide on the first turn racing toward the back, continued five
then six wide on the far turn, gained steadily but missed the super. LOOKINASSAH tucked in racing toward the rear, saved ground on the first turn and the
far turn till about the quarter, came out at that juncture and ran on. TWIXTER was forwardly-positioned four to five wide early, dropped back four wide on the
far turn, failed to rally. RESTORING ORDER raced mid-pack three to four wide early, put to urging five wide on the far turn, was never near enough to
threaten. PROUD RONIN set the pace inside, gave way. WAR IN CHARGE stalked two to three wide, came up empty. GOODLUCKMATE broke a step
slowly, was not a factor. UNCAPTURED MOMENT broke awkwardly then was encouraged forward outside to pursue the pace four wide through the first
turn, faltered and faded.

Footnotes
ROCKSTAR RO travelled three wide near the back with rivals on either side into the turn, commenced his run inside midway on the turn, angled outside in
the four path when they turned for home and was full of run late to get up in time for the victory. SOUPER CLASSY stalked in the middle of the field all alone
at the half, was ridden to go after the top pair at the quarter pole, dug in determinedly on the fence in upper stretch, wore down the leaders at the furlong
marker but could not hold off the fast closing winner nearing the wire. AIM FOR THE SKY chased the frontrunner in the early stages, continued to battle on
trying to run down the early speed at the top of the lane, lost his path in deep stretch and shifted out nearing the wire never losing momentum to get up for
the show award. GIANT TEDDY was hustled early on the rail to get the lead down the backside, dictated the pace on the turn, opened up on the field
turning for home, began to get weary at the furlong marker drifting out a touch and tired late holding on for a small share of the prize. POSEIDON STEEL
stalked four wide outside at the half, began to advance outside horses four wide midway on the turn and found his best stride late closing in the stretch but
could not threaten at the wire. LONG POND hit the gate at the start to trail the field down the backside, could see them all into the turn, began to pick up
rivals outside at the five sixteenths marker, angled out widest in the five path at the top of the lane and showed some late energy gaining on runners down
the stretch. POINT TO THE STARS was nudged along to get an inside position entering the turn, was shuffled back on the rail three furlongs from the finish,
saved ground entering the stretch and could not get involved racing to the finish. STYLISH GENT tracked three wide down the backstretch, was roused at
the three eighths marker but could not keep up and retreated between runners at the quarter pole. HIDDEN HONOR had a fair start but refused at the break
and walked off.

Footnotes
HARDWARE GAP stalked the leading pair, advanced four wide on the turn, bid and took the lead at the quarter pole, drifted out a path turning into upper
stretch, was clear and held sway. SOVEREIGN CAUSE tracked inside, moved through on the rail past the quarter pole bumping an outside rival, gained
steadily and slowly through the lane but wasn't enough. STAR SCHOLAR settled off the pace, went two to three wide into the turn, swung seven wide for
the drive, was gaining but too late and got the nod for show over. KILLARY , who settled off the pace, fanned eight wide, rallied in tandem with STAR
SCHOLAR but needed more. FORITTABLE stalked the leader, moved closer to press three wide taking a narrow and brief lead about on the turn, had no
extra. DIXIE'S FLATTER was bumped at the start, shifted in and advanced to mid-pack, went three then four wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick.
HE'S FULLY LOADED moved forward to dictate terms while being kept well off the inside, moved nearer the rail to the two path entering the turn, was
pressured later on that bend, bumped past the quarter pole and weakened. SNOOKERED saved ground but was never near enough to threaten.
NITEINSHININGARMOR bumped a rival at the start, encouraged along four wide on the turn, did not threaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO
ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
AVOMAN hounded the frontrunner in the early stages keeping a close eye throughout, began to reel in the speed commencing five sixteenths from the wire,
bid two wide at the top of the stretch, battled on determinedly in a match race for the win down the lane and was inching away for late for a hard fought
victory. LAC MACAZA took command from the beginning, was loose on the lead unchallenged to open up down the backstretch, braced for the challenger
when headed outside at the top of the stretch, having something in reserve fought on determinedly in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly in the end.
ARTIE'S STORM had a good stalking trip three wide outside horses unobstructed with a half mile remaining, rallied three wide on the far turn, was gaining
in the stretch but could not find another gear to threaten the top two and finished up well to be a clear third. CANDY OVERLOAD travelled near the back
three wide into the first turn, had little progression down the backside, was urged four wide on the far turn, offered little gain, angled out to the five path
turning for home for clear run and showed some late interest to pass tiring runners for a small share. GRANDSON travelled on the rail into the first turn,
settled near the rear between runners at the half, began to rally shifting off a tired rival at the three eighths marker, was in contention for a share when they
turned for home with runners on either side and stalled at the furlong pole. FULL EXTREME was situated at the back racing three wide into the first turn,
continued to take a stalking position outside down the backstretch, offered a mild run four wide midpoint on the final turn, angled out more for the drive but
could not be a factor late. DUN DRUM was in a good position tracking the top pair inside at the half, was urged for more run on the rail at the three furlong
marker, had little response and was empty for the stretch drive. BENLION trailed the field throughout, angled outside for the drive but could not get
interested down the lane.

Footnotes
GASTON steadied when in tight entering the first turn two wide, continued on or just off the rail, advanced two to three wide on the far turn, angled to the rail
about the three-sixteenths, gained steadily inside exchanging light bumps while dueling with an outside foe. BRINGER OF RAIN moved clear on the first
turn racing in the two path to set the pace, faced pressure up the backstretch, dispatched that foe but was soon joined by an outside rival, dueled inside that
one from the quarter pole, was joined by an inside foe and exchanged minor bumps with that one while dueling late. LORD OF WAR settled off the leaders
four wide, advanced four to five deep on the far turn making a bid at the quarter pole, dueled till the wire and was just outfinished. SUNRISE DRIVE bumped
a rival at the break, settled two wide off the pace in the early going, moved out four wide coming to the quarter pole, angled out further in upper stretch for
room, splits foes six wide at the sixteenth pole and was gaining on the top trio but too late. DESOLATOR raced off the pace toward the back caught four
wide, advanced on the far turn fanning eight wide, needed more late. SOUPER COHIBA was bumped at the break, settled inside early, came out and went
two wide on the far turn, improved position inside foes late. BET N WIN was encouraged forward at the start, edged closer early up the backstretch to press
the pace three wide, weakened. RELIABILITY broke a step slowly, switched out from four to six wide on the first turn, advanced outside seven to eight wide
up the backstretch and on the far turn reaching good position at the top of the stretch but could not sustain the effort and flattened out. ROYAL SPIRIT
raced mid-pack four wide early, advanced six wide on the far turn reaching striking distance then evened out. EMBRACE MY UNCLE dropped back to last
on the first turn, trailed up the backstretch, swung nine wide and passed tired rivals. SELFMADE was forwardly-placed four wide chasing the pace, came up
empty. GOSPEL WAY tracked in behind the leader inside, came up empty. SANDY BAY pursued from mid-pack three to four wide, dropped back and
faded. OCTOBER FROST raced off the pace five to six wide, failed to rally.

Footnotes
READY FOR A FIGHT had a good spot tracking the front trio at the half, was coaxed along to take closer order with two furlongs remaining, angled out four
wide for dead aim on the frontrunner turning for home and closed with intent to get up nearing the wire in a well timed rally. SWOT ANALYSIS dictated the
pace down the backside with challengers just behind, opened up mildly on his chasers through the turn, continued to roll on in upper stretch and was
beginning to fade at the furlong marker and was caught nearing the wire. SOUPER WATSON forced the pace scenario outside early on, took the role of
chaser on the turn, was in contention in the three path at the top of the lane but needed more late to threaten the top two and settled for being a clear third
in the end. LUCKY CURLIN pressed between runners for top spot in the early stages, took back mildly to track the frontrunner inside sitting just behind on
the turn, stayed on the fence for the drive, had clear running room in upper stretch and could not offer a finish. SPITE STORE had a good position tracking
the front threesome on the rail down the backside, tapped on the brakes while inside when in tight quarters entering the turn, was in the mix for a share
between horses two furlongs from the wire and was one paced down the lane. ENTRY TO HEAVEN was void of early speed to trail in the beginning, started
to rally inside with five sixteenths to the finish, angled outside in the four path circling runners at the quarter pole, shifted six wide at the top of the lane and
showed late interest closing well the final eighth. CASH DIVIDEND stalked near the rear in the early stages, put in a mild advance running in mid pack at the
three furlong marker and could not make an impact in the final furlong to be involved in the late stages. CLEAR DESTINATION offered a mild run on the rail
through the turn saving ground and came up empty for the stretch drive. HAVE A SOUPER DAY was situated between horses near the back of the pack
with a half mile still left to run, lost interest with foes on either side racing on the turn and could not threaten in the late stages. WIN D'ORO was ridden hard
four wide midpoint on the turn, offered a slight advance outside runners with a quarter to go and weakened between rivals in the stretch. SEVENTYSEVEN
STONE stalked five wide outside down the backstretch, could not keep pace with challengers on the turn, trailed in upper stretch and was not a factor to
finish line.

Footnotes
SUGAR RAY was urged at the break, moved forward to set the pace, widened into the far turn, held safe under moderate hand urging. TWENTY FOUR
MAMBA settled off the pace, went four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner, secured second and held from JUSTIN'S WAY, who raced mid-pack
three to four wide, moved out for the drive, was gaining late on the runner-up. TEMPO MADNESS chased the winner three wide, weakened. MIDWAY
MISCHIEF raced toward the rear inside, came out in upper stretch and ran on. C C'S KINGDOM raced mid-pack two to three wide on the turn and came out
a bit for the stretch, lacked the needed late kick. CURE IN REACH failed to menace racing mostly three to four wide from the turn to the stretch. STOLEN
MONEY chased from inside, weakened. BE LIKE CLINT shifted in going two to three wide on the turn and was never near enough to threaten. NONNO'S
LITTLE BOY raced outside four to five wide on the turn, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BEAU GUEST was part of the frontrunning batch of runners at the half mile marker, began to open up on her fellow rivals around the turn, drifted out on the
stretch drive with a sixteenth remaining and held safe at the wire. MR. DE broke sharp to be in front leaving the chute, battled up front down the backstretch,
was shuffled back some positions running between horses three furlongs from the prize, rebid three wide in upper stretch, shifted inwards to the rail the last
sixteenth and held on the the place money at the finish. COLONEL MUSTARD travelled on the rail in the second tier stalking the contesting frontrunners
down the backstretch, made a strong move inside midpoint on the turn, shifted out to the four path circling horses at the quarter pole, was in the five path
when they straightening out and finished up well enough through the stretch to just miss out on the place share in a close photo. TAKE CHARGE SOUSI
stalked three deep outside entering the turn, offered a mild advance four wide two furlongs from the finish line, angled out in the six path at the top of the
stretch and had some good late energy to settle on the fringes. MAGNIFICENT MARIO stalked in the second flight of runners between horses down the
backside, was steadied momentarily with foes on each side in midturn, regrouped at the quarter pole, was five wide behind horses at the top of the lane and
passed tired runners in mid stretch. ZAKHARI was part of the pace foursome on the rail at the half, was urged while saving ground on turn, offered little
response and faltered inside turning for home. IGNITE THE STORM was eager four deep down the backstretch to press the issue outside, took up a
chasing role while still wide travelling on the turn, was ridden hard to keep position two furlongs from home and retreated in upper stretch. FLATTER
COLLECTION hopped at the break, was in a drive after a quarter to keep in touch with the field, could not reach contention running on the turn and was not
a factor late.

Footnotes
VELOCE settled just off the pace and was caught four to five wide early, advanced to bid three wide about the nine-sixteenths, drew clear, held safe. BET
shifted in from three to two wide on the first turn racing off the pace, moved out heading up the backstretch, advanced five then six wide on the far turn
coming seven deep into upper stretch, gained the place. FIRST SPRING steadied when in tight on heels two wide heading to the first turn, moved out from
two to three wide on that bend, tipped out further up the backstretch, advanced four then five wide on the far turn, kicked on well but was outfinished for
second. COLEYVILLE shifted in and rated inside on or just off the rail toward the back early, moved out up the backstretch, raced three to four wide on the
far turn coming into upper stretch five deep, ran on. ROCKET JOE COPPER steadied past the seven-eighths when in tight behind a runner, moved out from
the rail a path, advanced three wide on the far turn, needed more. JEGOS FIRE stalked up close from outside, raced four to six wide throughout, lacked the
needed late kick. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE was forwardly-placed stalking then pressing the pace, raced two to three wide, took a brief narrow lead about the
nine-sixteenths, weakened. LIL'S TURN shifted to the rail about the seven-eighths racing mid-pack, moved out and travelled two to three wide on the far
turn, failed to rally. WICKED MIAH broke a bit awkwardly and slowly, raced two to four wide on both turns, passed some tired foes. GLOVANNA raced
toward the back two to three wide on the turns and was not a factor. NATIVE PRINCE chased up close three to four wide, came up empty. TARADAR was
urged forward, set the pace inside, faltered and faded.
