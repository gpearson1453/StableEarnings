Footnotes
GOTTA DEAL hopped and bobbled at the start, made a four wide bid through the turn and took the lead in mid stretch and drew clear. GOLDEN SOPO
raced near the back down the backstretch then made a four wide rally to be up for the place. FLAT OUT FABIO raced in the middle of the pack to the turn
then made a rail bid around the turn, moved out to three wide at the sixteenths pole and finished evenly. ISLE CALL U LATER was hustled along to duel for
the lead from the two path to the three eighths pole and weakened. EXOTIC GENTLEMAN sprinted to the lead and dueled from the inside to the three
eighths pole, inched away to a clear lead, was headed in mid stretch and tired. CHELSEA'S GLORY was four wide early at the back dropped in on the turn
but was never a threat. MACER THE RACER tracked the leaders from off the rail but lacked a late response.

Footnotes
UNCLE FRANK went to a pressured lead to set all the pace through the first turn and down the backstretch then inched away at the quarter pole and drew
off. POSEIDON WRATH raced in the middle of the pack from the inside through the final turn then angled out in upper stretch but was no match for the
winner. STAN'S MIRACLE MAN was hustled along to vie for the lead from the two path to the quarter pole and tired. DRIED PEPPER was placed in the
middle of the pack in the four path while racing one paced. HERZEN was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a mild bid on the backstretch and
flattened out. WHITAKER was positioned in the middle of the pack in the two path and finished evenly. UNIFIED ASSETS went four to five wide into the first
turn then raced in the middle of the pack from the five path and was widest off all. HARDCORE FOLKLORE was void of speed and never a threat. DALLAS
GOLD was unhurried early and never a factor.

TAKEN BACK unhurried to the three furlong pole then launched his bid to circle the field going four wide on the final turn, was closing willingly to be up in
final strides. MUFFIN NUTS was hustled along to be forwardly placed in the three path, took the lead at the three eighths pole and drew off but was nailed at
the wire. BODEE BODEE raced in the middle of the pack on the inside to the final turn then made a two wide bid, tired to split horses and lacked room,
bumped outside rival and steadied slightly, made a rebid and proved best of rest. COUNTERFEIT vied for the lead around the first turn then lead briefly at
the half pole and weakened around the five sixteenths pole. LIAM SKYE was allowed to settle through the final turn and passed tiring rivals. MIND ON MY
MONEY was placed close up two to three wide down the backstretch then made a two wide bid on the final turn and was bumped by inside rival and
faltered. ROCK ON COWBOY was roused to a brief lead to the first turn then vied for the lead from between horses to the three furlong pole and gave way.

APHRODITES REVENGE broke in sharply and bumped TAKE ME AS I AM At the start, then was hustled along to be forwardly placed, engaged leaders at
the three furlong pole but couldn't match strides and tired. VELVET NIGHT was rushed up to take the early lead from the two path then vied for lead around
