Footnotes
FORT ZANNA saved ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, gained steadily at the rail through the far turn and dug in for the
lead mid-stretch. AT THE GATE moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn near the
rail, drifted leaving the turn, dug in under steady encouragement but was caught inside the sixteenth pole. COFFEE BEAN stalked off the rail the first turn,
picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, drifted leaving the far turn, got up for third mid-stretch and finished well at the outside flank of the
pace-setter. SERIOUS MOMENT rated close inside on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then flattened
mid-stretch. REGGAETONI stalked from the four path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn.
KOKOLORES rounded the first turn well back in the three path on the first turn and was never a factor. MIDNIGHT PASS stalked the early pace about the
three path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but weakened into the far turn. MY BEST GIRL rounded the opening turn in the three and
four paths and was not a factor.

MANHATTAN WEAVE took over and moved to the inside to set the early pace, lost the lead while drifting into the backstretch, recovered stride from the
three eighths pole and raced at the rail on the far turn, eased out leaving the turn, took the lead mid-stretch and edged clear later yards. A FAREWELL
YODEL rated close inside on the first turn, took the lead when Manhattan Weave drifted into the backstretch and rated the pace from that point, came under
pressure past the five sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn but was caught mid-stretch. POSTED raced off the early pace in the three and four
paths and left the first turn wide, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path and ran evenly in the lane. MASTER
YOO saved ground, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the stretch. TYRY
TYRANNOSAURUS raced off the rail on the first turn, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, but flattened in the
stretch. MASTER THIS saved ground well back on the opening turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn in the six path and showed little more. THORN OF ROSE HILL raced well off the pace in the three path the first turn, gave chase from
the three eighths pole but faded off the rail on the far turn. FIGAROS FORTUNE stalked in the three path the first turn, picked up the chase from the three

STEVETHEVANDRIVER chased inside through the backstretch, rounded the turn at the rail, dug in leaving the turn and held on for second. KUKULKAN
chased the early pace inside, raced off the rail on the turn, eased out into the stretch and dueled for third. INSIDE RISK chased through the backstretch,
rounded the turn in the five path, finished well and just missed third. BIG HAMBONE chased the pace, rounded the turn about the six path then flattened in
the lane. SHACKLEFORDS STORM gave chase, rounded the turn two deep then flattened stride. NITRO TIME angled in and stalked two deep, but
dropped back at the quarter pole, raced off the rail on the turn then weakened. RULING gave chase then weakened in the five path of the turn.

BIG DADDY D R chased outside through the backstretch, raced four wide on the turn and dug in under a hand ride to get up the final strides.
BILLINGSGATE chased through the backstretch, raced close three wide on the turn, dueled to a slim brief lead in later yards but was outfinished in the final
strides. ADIOS SEE YA became anxious in the gate then dueled for early control approaching the five sixteenths pole, contested the edge at the rail on the
turn, dug in under steady handling leaving the turn but was met, and relented from mid-stretch. BAYTOWN JAKESTER chased the early pace inside but
had to steady while hemmed in leaving the three eighths pole, recovered stride toward the quarter, raced close at the rail on the turn but flattened the final
sixteenth. CHESTNUT LIME gave chase, rounded the turn in the four and five paths and showed little in the lane. LION OF THE SEA chased the pace and
raced close two deep on the turn, though, weakened leaving the eighth pole. DOESN'T MAKE CENTS surged clear leaving the gate and contested the early
pace with a slim lead, was met approaching the five sixteenths pole, checked at the inside flank of Lion Of The Sea midway on the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
SUPER WILDCAT chased inside, raced near the rail on the turn and dug in through the lane to get up the final yards. UNCANNY exchanged contact with
Sweetonthegents leaving the gate then hustled to the front nearing the three eighths pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn near the rail, was
steadily handled to late stretch but was caught in the final yards. CLEARLY VISIBLE was shuffled back at the start and gave distant early chase, rounded
the turn near the rail then outfinished in the stretch duel for second. NANCYSAIDSO chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn about the four path,
angled to the six path leaving the turn and finished well. SWEETONTHEGENTS exchanged contact with Uncanny leaving the gate, gave chase and raced
near the rail on the turn, then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. ONE SMART COOKIE gave chase, rounded the turn about the three path then weakened.
KIRBY chased through the backstretch, raced in the six path of the turn and showed little in the lane. TRUE HEIRESS angled to the outside to give chase
and was never a factor. PEACEFUL WAY pressured the pace nearing the three eighths pole, remained close off the rail on the turn then weakened.

HOT FUDGE SONDE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and rounded the far turn in the two and three paths, then dueled
through the stretch to take the nod in the final strides. SPANGLISH rated close inside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded
the far turn near the rail, dueled to a slim brief lead past the eighth pole but was outfinished in the final strides while dueling for second. ONE NIGHT MIKE
moved to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole, raced at the rail on the far turn, was met leaving the eighth pole then
outfinished in the duel through the stretch. PENGUIN PARADE became a bit edgy in the gate, was unprepared for the break and hopped at the start, saved
ground well off the early pace, bid leaving the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. EPIC TIME stalked the early
pace two deep, gave chase leaving the half mile pole then flattened in the three path of the far turn. C R'S UNCLE LINO settled off the rail on the first turn,
picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the turn about the five path, angled in leaving the turn but showed little further. REMYS SHOWTIME
stalked the early pace in the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the five path of the far turn. NIGHT TRAIN WAYNE became
edgy in the gate and rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn outside and showed little response.
