Footnotes
MUCHO MOJO to the front well handled, stayed on the lead while ridden out under good handling. KID SHELLEEN good position inside, to far turn, split
horses, ran on for place. TAP THE CANDY prompted leader to far turn, could not go on settled for show. TRICOLOUR unhurried to far turn, launched a
wide run to move up. VERSATILE prompted pace to quarter pole, could not go on, wilted stretch. ROUND OF APPLAUSE no speed between horses to far
turn with no late kick in stretch. NORDIC LIGHT tried hard to keep up outside to far turn, could not go on, faded. GUS GUS no hurry from the gate, failed to
seriously menace throughout. HABITUS saved ground throughout with no punch in the stretch run. ALFIO could not keep up to the half and never varied
thereafter. DEMANDED bit tardy from the gate, never a real menace thereafter.
