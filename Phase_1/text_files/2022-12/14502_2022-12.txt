Footnotes
SAINT GOAR was bumped at the start then allowed to settle, closed rapidly in the five path through the stretch under right handed urging and was along in
time. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER pressed the pace three wide, made the lead nearing the turn, quickly drew clear, set a rapid pace until deep stretch then
couldn't handle the winner. MAKING ME CRAZY saved ground and passed tiring rivals. CUMBER away alertly, set the pace two wide for five sixteenths of a
mile, chased the pace into the stretch then faded. QUESTION AUTHORITY stumbled at the start and failed to menace. ENJOY BASEBALL broke inward
bumping the winner at the start then was no threat. BREEZY MONEY had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
MUTINY broke in full stride to set all the pace and prevailed under confident handling. MOESTER stalked the pace three wide and was steadily cutting into
the winners advantage late. FOREIGN chased the winner two wide then along the inside into the stretch and lacked the needed response. BEAT THE
DEALER failed to menace. MASTEROFTHEHOUNDS vied for the lead along the inside into the turn, dropped back and faded in the four path. RAISE THE
PURSES was no factor. BLUE MONARCH was outrun. STREAKY had brief speed.

Footnotes
BOURBON WISDOM trailed through the far turn, swung wide, closed with a rush in the middle of the racetrack to make the lead in deep stretch and drew
off. TRIGZ TOO stalked the early pace three wide, made the lead before a half, widened on the far turn and into the stretch then couldn't handle the winner.
NOT YET CHARLIE never far back, offered a mild bid in the four pat on the far turn then was outfinished. JUSTIN'S QUEST failed to menace. MOTAGALLY
well placed, failed to respond. UNCAPTURED PULSE pressed the pace around the clubhouse turn, remained a sharp threat into the stretch then gave way.
PATIO PARTY set the early pace inside, had momentum into the stretch then was used up. CANDY KINGDOM lost his jockey at the start and was walked
off. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

Footnotes
WE ALL SEE IT always within striking distance, rallied three wide into the stretch, made the lead before the furlong marker and won going away.
SNOWSCAPE away alertly, set the pace into the stretch then was no match for winner. MAXIMUM IMPACT chased the pace two wide, shifted out to the
five path entering the stretch and was outfinished. ICON angled in entering the clubhouse turn, settled inside rivals under a strong hold near the rail, moved
closer nearing the top of the stretch, angled out to the four path then faded. LOOK AWAY failed to menace. GONE ROGUE was in tight entering the first
turn and never threatened.

NATES HEARTTHROB bumped at the start, was allowed to settle, closed willingly three wide into the stretch, made the lead while well handled past the
furlong marker and drew off under left handed urging. VALHALLA AIR BASE broke in front, set the pace until deep stretch then was no match for the
winner. PRETTY LOUD settled inside then passed tiring rivals late three wide. LEND AMERICA failed to menace. SOUPER PRONTO bumped with the
winner at the start, prompted the pace two wide for six furlongs then weakened. STOP MAKING SENSE saved ground while stalking the pace for six
furlongs then gave way in the stretch. PAPA CHARLES was outrun. THE EQUINEST was no threat. PASION AZTECA offered little.

Footnotes
MISSION GIRL stalked the pace into the far turn, rallied three wide to make the lead near the quarter pole and edged clear under left handed urging. LA
ROSA pressed the pace three then two wide, made the lead between calls on the far turn then couldn't handle the winner. MOBIL CHIC close up along the
inside from the start, angled out to the six path entering the stretch then finished evenly. LUCKY PENNY ROSE slow early, found her best stride late.
RUNLIKEJACKIEO moved up between rivals into the far turn then leveled off. QUEEN HIGH set the pace along the inside into the far turn, checked along
the rail at the quarter pole, remained a sharp threat until deep stretch then weakened. ROCKY CHANNEL was no threat. NO TWOWAYSABOUTIT had
speed for a half then wilted. COWCHI was no factor. CONSECUTIVE RUN pressed the early pace two wide and was through after a half. THE RIDER OF
QUEEN HIGH LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE QUARTER POLE.
