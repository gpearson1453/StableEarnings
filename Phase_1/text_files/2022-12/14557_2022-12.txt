Footnotes
MRS. NECAISE brushed an inner rival at the start, vied two wide, led leaving the three furlong pole, drifted out to the six path entering the lane while
meeting ISN'T IT TIME's challenge, dueled determinedly while getting headed at the furlong grounds, yet gamely regained an advantage soon after, and
edged away through the final sixteenth. ISN'T IT TIME stalked three wide while perched outside of the top pair, produced a bid entering the lane while
getting floated to the seven path by the leader, sparred and wrestled an advantage at the furlong grounds, but flattened out a sixteenth from home. BEANIE
tracked two wide and between horses, tipped three wide entering the lane while taking aim inside of the drifting leading pair, but only managed to chase
them therafter. ANSLIE'S GUMDROP broke out a the start, tracked four wide, fanned to the seven to eight path entering the lane, and kept on for a minor
share. SHEEZA PRIORITY trailed in the two path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and moved up late. HOT PATOOTIE broke a bit in at the start,
laid close up along the inside, backed off to stalk when the leader tucked across her path down the backstretch, then lacked rail racing room in upper
stretch, and came up empty once clear. GOOD GIRL SHORTY brushed with an outer rival at the start, set the pace inside of that vying foe down he
backstretch, but was headed at the three furlong pole, then faltered in upper stretch. CALL ME DARLIN was herded out multiple paths by an inner rival at
the start, lacked speed while hung five wide, and faded.

Footnotes
AUTOCRATIC set the pace inside of a pair of vying rivals around the turn while a path off of the inside, shook free of them entering the lane, and held sway
under driving pressure. HIGH TONE bobbled at the start, pressed the leading pair approaching the turn, vied with them from the four path around the bend,
but briefly failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart at the quarter pole, and only managed to chase him home. COURAGEOUS TIMMY brushed an
inner rival at the start, tracked the leading trio from the four path, shifted out in upper stretch while attempting to take aim, and chased evenly through the
final furlong. SEMI CHARMED LIFE bobbled and brushed an outer rival before rankly tossing his head in the aftermath, tracked from just off of the inside
around the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch. BLUSHINSTREETDEVIL prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied in the three path
around the turn, but yielded to those foes at the quarter pole. SIXTO broke a step slowly, lagged behind into the turn, and made little impact. CRAFTY HEAT
took the turn in the five path while lacking speed, and tired.

Footnotes
FOR REAL ALICE took a bump from an outer rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the four path, rallied to bid coming to the furlong grounds, drove clear
soon after, and lasted from an outer on-charging rival late. COMMERCIAL FLASH bumped with an inner rival multiple times before having her hind heels
clipped by her soon after, raced far back in the three path around the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, rallied with the clear leader to catch in the final
sixteenth, surged late, but just came up short. PEACEFUL VISION was bumped by an outer rival into an inner foe at the start, pursued the clear leader from
the three path around the turn, made first run to bid along with an outer rival approaching midstretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and lost
place to an outer rival in the late stages. KASEN'S SISTER was jostled between horses before being pinched back, pushed out by inner foes, and caused to
clip heels with an outer rival at the start, raced far back along the inside, shifted four wide in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. SILK SHAKER was
herded into an outer rival by an inner foe at the start, chased from the two path, but gave way. BIGJIM'S SILVERGAL bumped with rivals on both side
multiple times at the start, saved ground while tracking, but to no avail. YOUNMEHONEYBUNNY broke in and bumped a foe at the start, lacked speed in
the five path, and faded. GLITTER TIME broke out and shared blame in causing trouble for outer rivals at the start, sped clear while running off under a firm
hold, but weakened and was overhauled in upper stretch, stopped readily, and walked across the wire before walking off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS'
INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START, NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
CANDY'S PARADE set the pace, repelled a pair of mild bids entering the lane, and drew off under driving pressure. CAVIAR RESOLUTION broke a bit out
at the start, settled off of the pace while saving ground, improved inside of foes down the backstretch to track the top pair into the far turn, ranged up outside
of them turning for home, but quickly failed to keep pace with the leader entering the lane, sparred for place thereafter, and narrowly prevailed. TOTAL
DISCRETION stalked outside of the pace setter, attempted a bid turning for home as an outer rival ranged up, but failed to keep pace with the leader
entering the lane, battled with his outer counterpart for place through the final furlong, but was bested. MAGICAL STARDUST laid off of the pace in the
three to four paths, and failed to menace. MEG AND CLAIR chased in the two path, and faded. TRACK QUEEN broke out at the start, tracked from the four
path, but was done early.

Footnotes
SOUL COAXING stalked three wide before tucking behind the top pair around the first turn, shifted back outside of them to loom a danger entering the far
turn, assumed command from those foes while well in hand approaching the five sixteenths pole, and drew off under light flagging through the lane. DIRECT
ORDER trailed, rallied three wide around the far turn to gain place at the three sixteenths pole, but was no threat to the winner while pulling well clear of
show. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE set the pace, but offered little resistance to an outer rival's bid around the far turn, then gave way through the lane, and held
show. PALATIAL TIMES tucked to the two path after being hung five wide into the first turn, and made little impact thereafter. VIM AND VIGOR lacked
speed in the four path, then two wide and between horses around the far turn, and failed to factor. SPECIAL PRYCE pressed two wide, but faded between
horses turning for home.

MICHELLES LIL STAR set the pace, showed the way from a pair of outer vying rivals around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, and drew off. OLIVIA G
stalked three to two wide and between horses, pressed around the turn, vied turning for home, but was turned away in upper stretch, and proved second
best. MUCHMORETHANREADY was bumped between horses and pinched back at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, picked up stride shifting
three wide turning for home, darted to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied willingly. CALLING laid off of the pace three to two wide, and chased evenly
between horses in midstretch. TWIRLING CAT was slightly herded by an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, but lacked the
needed kick. PRAY FOR US bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack two wide before tucking to the rail around the turn, and gave way
turning for home. MIA ANTONIA lacked speed in the four path, and made little impact. RE RE'S RAINBOW broke multiple lengths slow, saved ground while
trailing, and improved inside of foes in upper stretch. BERNIECE chased four to three wide, pressed around the turn, but weakened on his left lead after
drifting to the six path entering the lane. MIDNIGHT FLAME pursued from midpack in the four path, but yielded in the seven path entering the lane. ROSIE
SPRIT bumped an inner rival at the start, then failed to make an impact after racing off of the pace two to three wide and between horses. CANGUA chased
two wide and between horses for a quarter mile, but steadily faded thereafter.

trio of bidders, and gave way. ONCOMING TRAIN trailed three wide, took the turn in the four path, fanned five wide nearing the lane, but failed to threaten.

Footnotes
NEW YEAR'S PARTY saved ground off of the pace, improved entering the lane, split the top pair approaching the furlong grounds, gained an advantage
from his outer rival at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. ENDURING PEACE stalked inside of foes while a bit off of the rail, came into the lane in the three
path, bid in upper stretch, led at the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the sixteenth pole. HALFGLAMOROUS tracked in the three
path, shifted to the five path turning for home, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, but lacked the needed kick while hanging on his left lead.
CHARLIE'S PEAK sped clear, but was headed by a pair of rivals nearing the furlong pole, and weakened. THEBOYZGALAXY tracked in the four path, but
tired once floated to the six path between horses entering the lane. KICK N KISS lagged behind around the turn, and stayed on. POINT OF VICTORY
stalked in the three path and between rivals around the turn, came into the lane in the five path, and gave way. SASSY MALLORY shifted out to the six path
around the turn, came into the lane in the nine path, and made little impact. MOMENT TO DREAM broke a step slowly, lacked speed in the four to six paths
around the turn, and faded.
