Footnotes
CHAIN REACTION vied inside for the lead, shook free on the turn, led into the lane, dug in gamely outside of PELOTA in the final furlong and prevailed
under urging. PELOTA tracked close up on the inside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail entering the stretch, dug in gamely inside in the drive and was
outfinished. BUCKS ARE MOVING was bumped at the start, raced two wide off the pace, between rivals at the quarter pole, rallied mildly inside and got the
nod for third. TANKINATOR vied outside for the lead, chased the winner on the turn, weakened and just missed for the show spot. DADASHEV stalked
outside a rival, raced three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and lacked a rally. WE READY raced off the pace inside, angled out at the eighth
pole and had no rally. EXPLAIN raced off the pace inside and did not factor. ANTE UP ALEX was bumped at the start, raced off the rail, off the pace and
was outrun. JUST A THOUGHT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace and gave way.

VERBIER underwent a shoe repair in the paddock, led inside, repelled a rival and led all the way under a long stretch drive. RECLUSE pressured the winner
throughout, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by. TEQUILAMADEMEDOIT settled off the pace in the two path then made a gradual late gain. LT'S
JACKNTHEBOX angled inside early, moved closer into the far turn then went evenly late. BIG REDWHITEBLUE lacked speed, bid wide on the final turn
then faded. QUESTION MY SANITY lagged far behind throughout then caught a stopping rival. STAFF SERGEANT was urged close up outside early,
raced very wide and stopped.

Footnotes
BATTLE OF BERLIN angled inside early, moved boldly to the front outside on the turn then eagerly drew off under moderate pressure. PRINCE OF
FENTON bobbled at the break, bid wide on the turn, raced an erratic course stretch through the stretch. ENFORCER forced the pace outside, steadied at
the five sixteenths then steadied in tight tiring in the stretch. STEELY DANZA raced off the leaders inside then began fading on the turn. BIGSHOT ON
NOTHING hustled to the front inside and stopped after half a mile. JUMP FOR THE WIN dropped back early wide and was never in contention. MUST BE
LOVE vied between rivals three wide early then gave way readily. COUNT DOWN flashed speed outside then stopped losing contact with his field. A claim
of foul by the third finisher against the winner for interference on the turn was dismissed. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the second finisher for
interference in the stretch was upheld. PRINCE OF FENTON was disqualified and placed third.

Footnotes
HOPE FOR GOLD stalked the pace, made a strong five wide bid on the turn, took over, drew off under urging, widened and was in hand the final yards.
MYQUIST steadied at the start, was outrun early, moved up inside on the turn, rode the rail in the stretch, rallied late and got up for second in a blanket
finish for the minor placings. COLD WALKER was fractious in the gate, dueled two wide for the lead, dueled on the turn, dug in through the lane and held on
for the show spot. VANCOUVER D'ORO raced off the pace between rivals, came three wide into the lane, closed mildly between horses and got the nod for
fourth. SUNSANDDRINKINHAND was outrun early, closed belatdly and just missed for the fourth spot. HEATED BATTLE was bumped at the start, raced
off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. DOUGIE was fractious in the gate, chased inside and had no rally. MR. TUTTLE dueled inside for the lead,
dueled on the turn and faded. ABOUT THE MULTIPLE was bumped at the start, chased outside, bid four wide on the turn and faded. LOVED AGAIN
chased the pace, bid three wide on the turn and gave way.
