Footnotes
ROTTERDAM settled off the early pace while racing two wide, angled out in search of a clear path down the backstretch, advanced three wide between
foes into the far turn, angled to the rail nearing the quarter pole, tipped back out in upper stretch, closed outside of the pacesetter and was up in deep
stretch. IMPOSTER SYNDROME set a clear pace in the two path and led until deep stretch. SHOCKWAVE stalked the pace two wide and was one-paced
through the lane to maintain the show. TUMIGA stalked the pace three wide and faded in the stretch. SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR was reluctant to load,
raced four and five off the pace, angled in a bit nearing the quarter pole and had no response. ROYAL FOX HILLS was outrun inside. BOLD MAJESTIC
played no factor while racing four and five wide. READY FOR DIAMONDS raced in range three wide and retreated through the lane. GRAND MACALLAN
had only brief speed inside.

path into the stretch, but yielded in upper stretch to place. BOSSHOG THEM DUKES was held up from the two path early, was coaxed along the rail around

SWIRVIN set the pace from inside, was cued when headed by a pair of outside rivals midway around the turn, rebroke and cut the corner entering the lane,
drifted out to the three path passing the sixteenth pole, and held on. GOODLOOKINRAGS stalked from inside into the turn, was coaxed while angling out to
the five path into the lane, and ran on in the stretch to place. BABY BILLY broke slow and was behind along the inside, was ridden while drifting out to the
seven path in upper stretch, and got up late for show. AL ATLASI broke in and bumped an inner rival, chased from four wide going into the turn, bid from
three wide turning into the stretch, but flattened. SCARAMANGA bobbled at the start, pressed from three wide, bid between rivals turning into the lane, but
faded. RULE IT raced from wellback in the five path but was never a threat. BERLONE stumbled at the start, recovered well to prompt the pace between
rivals but gaveway rounding the turn. COLONEL CAPPY rated from the two path but was no menace. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE JOCKEY OF
GOODLOOKINRAGS AGIAINST THE JOCKEY OF SWIRVIN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

MY MAN FLINT was bumped between foes at the start, saved ground off the early pace, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, angled
back in in midstretch, closed inside and was up in deep stretch. GOOCH GO BRAGH raced two wide in midpack while pulling around the first turn, angled
four wide nearing the far turn, advanced four deep around that bend, took over nearing the eighth pole and led until deep stretch. BACKCHAT raced off the
pace three wide, edged close three wide around the far turn and ran on for the show. BETWEEN THE COVERS hit the starting gate but was still away
toward the front of the pack, stalked the pace inside, was shut off near the quarter pole, tipped out in upper stretch and regained some ground between foes
in the lane. MORETHANICANHANDLE set the pace along the rail to midstretch and weakened. AZTEC was bumped at the start, tracked the pace three
wide and faded in the drive. RED HURRICANE was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. THE BEST DISTANCE stalked the pace
two wide, bid midway around the far turn then came up empty in the lane. MOPED DENNIS broke a bit awkwardly then was in tight soon after, raced four
and five wide and made little impact. DANLEY trailed throughout while racing in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
LOST A LEGEND stalked along the inside early, was roused while tipping out two wide around the turn, bid from the four path entering the stretch, dueled
with the pacesetting inner foe to the wire, and prevailed in the final strides. VILLEGAS SWING set the pace in the two path, was coaxed when headed into
the lane, dug in gamely and dueled with an outside foe to the wire but yielded in the final strides for place. MOGALU prompted the pace in the two path, lost
ground around the turn, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, evened out but held on to show. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH rated from the four path,
was hustled into the stretch, but was one paced. CANDENZA had to steady along the inside early, chased from the two path, was driven from the rail into
the lane, but flattened. WAR FEATHER raced from wellback and two wide, was cued from the three path turning into the stretch, but was no factor. JOYFUL
SURPRISE trailed along the inside, had to check going into the stretch, and never threatened.

COLERIDGE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, continued on the left lead in the lane, took the lead
nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. ON THIN ICE raced two wide in midpack, angled four wide in midstretch and rallied for the place. NEWS BREAK
stalked the pace two wide, took the lead in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth marker and weakened from there. SKI PATROL saved ground off the early
pace, went five wide around the far turn, swung nine wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly. SPACE RUNNER saved ground in midpack early, went
three wide around the far turn, angled seven wide in upper stretch and had a mild rally between foes. RED HORNET tracked the pace from the rail, tipped
out in upper stretch and faded. CARROTHERS was outrun inside. LAKER MAMBA set the pace along the rail and tired in the drive. CAUSIN' MAYHEM
failed to menace while racing three and four wide. RED LINE OVERDRIVE played no factor while racing three wide. MODERN SCIENCE (IRE) stalked the
pace three wide and retreated through the lane. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED. FRACTIONS ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
CAJUN DREAM prompted the pace while three wide early, was cued to bid from the five path turning into the stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong.
VANISHING INTEREST pressed from two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole, was roused from the three path into the lane, and ran on but yielded
in the final sixteenth to place. POWER HUMOR had an awkward start, stalked from four wide, was ridden along while making a bid three wide around the
turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and evened out to show. ADIOS PAPA CHICO tracked in the three path, was driven from the five
path into the lane, but was one paced. HOLIDAY FANTASY rated in the four path, drifted out top the seven path turning into the stretch, and was no factor.
GENTLEMAN GERRY broke in and chased from the rail but never menaced. CATALINA EXPRESS led from inside going into the turn but yielded midway
around the turn.

Footnotes
DUE VINI prompted the pace from the two path, bid for the lead while two wide around the far turn, was cued at the top of the lane, led into the final furlong,
and held on. IMPULSIVENESS trailed from inside around the first turn, moved up from said position going into the far turn, was coaxed while shifting out to
the five path entering the lane, and rallied in the final furlong to get up for place. VAN DUSEN (GB) stalked from the two path, moved up to bid three wide
going into the far turn, drifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and kept on but was outrun by an outer rival to finish with show honors. WARP SPEED
BABY set the pace from inside, was roused when headed midway around the far turn, but yielded in the final furlong. EL SEGUNDO was unhurried from the
rail early, never reached a threatening position, and passed tiring foes in the stretch. SEBARAY raced in midpack from the three path, was coaxed while
looming up four wide around the far turn, floated out to the six path going into the stretch, and flattened. BLUTO'S CANDY rated from the two path, was
driven along while tipping out to the seven path in upper stretch, but was never a factor. CAPTURE MI tracked in the two path, was roused between rivals
while swinging out to the four path entering the lane, had to steady and shift back in near the eighth pole, and was tired.
