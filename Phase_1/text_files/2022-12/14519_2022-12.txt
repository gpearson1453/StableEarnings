back gamely along the inside and proved best under strong handling. ANN KOR raced six wide down the backstretch, rallied three wide into the stretch
gaining a narrow lead before the furlong marker then couldn't handle the winner. SISTER CODE pressed the pace along the inside into the stretch then
faded. JACK'S YACHT QUEEN close up four wide, angled out a bit bumping AUGURI entering the turn then lacked the needed response. GRACIE

ST PATTY'S SONG never far back, closed willingly three wide in the six path into the stretch, made the lead at the furlong marker and finished full of run
under a strong hand ride to win as much the best. SPUN PRETTY away alertly, set the pace until mid stretch and gamely held on for second two wide.
EASTER PRIDE unhurried early, finished determinedly along the rail. DEB'S ALL OUT was no factor, pulled up injured past the wire and was vanned off.
ARTIES CRYPTONITE chased the early pace and was through after a half.

Footnotes
PRINCESS HALIME stalked the pace while saving ground, rallied to make the lead nearing the quarter pole then widened the balance of the trip to win as
much the best under confident handling. TOY TIGER sped to the lead before a quarter, set the pace off the rail for nearly a half and just held on for second
in the three path. WILLYMAR saved ground and finished finished determinedly. COURTED trailed into the stretch, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. SHE
MAKES ME TIZZY stalked the pace in the five path into the stretch then faded. SABELLE offered a mild bid outside on the turn then came up empty. TARA
DAWN was outrun. BLUE SAGE broke in front, gave up the lead before a quarter, chased the pace into the turn then stopped.

stretch then was outfinished. SUNDRENCHED failed to menace. FLECK was no threat. TIZ THIRSTY was through after a half. UNTAPPED ENERGY away
alertly, set a pressured pace along the inside for five furlongs then stopped.

Footnotes
RED HEAD KID matched strides for the lead two wide then along the inside into the stretch and shook clear under mild left handed urging. NOSEY POWER
allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch five wide and got up for second. MY TICKET allowed to settle, split horses through the far turn, angled out a bit
and finished determinedly four wide. SPLENDID SPIRIT dueled for the lead three then two wide into the stretch then was outfinished. ORLEANS STORM
unhurried early, advanced in the three path on the far turn and into the stretch then leveled off. CANTRUNWITHBIGDOGS steadied entering the first turn
and was no threat. BIG TIME FLIRT stalked the pace into the far turn then folded. PLAYING BALL contested the early lead along the inside and was
through after a half.
