Footnotes
DIXIE FURY stalked the issue early in the three path, advanced and took over turning for home, drove well clear. RITHM NIC within striking distance toward
the inside, two path into the lane, improved to race closest to the winner nearing midstretch, proved no match for that one late, clearly second best. LORD
GRANTHAM off a step slow, raced back early, dropped inside, saved ground through the turn, switched out when straightened for home, rallied for the
show. ATKINS lacked early foot in the two path, continued in the two path early turn, swung four wide into the lane, finished with some mild interest to
improve slightly. SMOOTH SCAT away in good order, sprinted clear before a quarter, continued to show the way through most of the turn while saving
ground, gave way when headed by the winner exiting the turn. SALTA lacked early foot, lacked speed three wide, failed to muster a rally when called on for
the drive. AFRAIDOFTHEBUNNY in mid pack while racing outside, five through through most of the turn, lacked a closing kick. MEAN TWEETS hesitated at
the start, remained back. DAY TRADE in the second flight while three wide for a half, backed up through the stretch.

Footnotes
BOLT FOR ALLISON broke alertly, set the pace in hand along the inside, shook clear entering the stretch, kept to pressure. WISH IT prompted the pace
outside, remained forward and three wide up the backstretch, closest to the winner three wide turning for home, proved no match for that one in the run to
the wire, well clear for the place. NO GUILT broke in, raced back and in the two path, asked along 2nd turn, proved no match for the top two while earing
part of the show. UNSTABLE PRINCESS void of speed, came three wide for the drive, staged a mild rally to dead heat for the show. KID'S LAST LAUGH in
a bit tight at the start, pressed the winner for six furlongs to that one's immediate outside, caved in stretch. TOUGH LEGACY lost footing at the break, raced
back, saved ground and was never dangerous. MAGICAL SONG four wide into the first turn when with the second flight, remained within striking distance,
gave way in the final turn. SUMMERTIME ROSE broke back, in some traffic along the inside first turn, stopped far turn. BICARB BETTY mid pack early,
stopped after a half, fell far back, lost contact with the field, jogged in.

Footnotes
SUMMORYA never far back well out in the strip, pressed three wide into the lane, slight brush into lane, long drive to the wire, fully extended to prove
narrowly best. LASSIE MY GIRL broke with leaders, narrowly set the pace, continued to lead into the stretch, proved stubborn to the end.
BENNYKAYANDSUZYTOO pressed the pace while racing three wide, remained within striking distance between the top two past midstretch and also gave
ground grudgingly. MS CARROLL COUNTY broke alertly, raced forwardly off the inside, in traffic far turn, came in the two path for the drive and went evenly
through the stretch in lacking a closing response. FOXPASS in mid pace off the inside, also encountered some traffic then lacked room early in the turn,
three wide through the bend and also went one paced through the lane. SASSY LASS bothered and was shuffled back soon after the start, moved out to be
four wide into the turn, improved position without posing a serious threat. ASEEL in mid pack and well wide, five path into the lane, four wide exiting the
bend, failed to rally. QUEENIES WAY last away, was used to move up steadily up the backstretch, five wide far turn, tired through the stretch. SOPHIE'S
STAR lacked speed while racing outside, three wide through the turn, failed to muster a closing punch. WHO LU brushed at the break, raced within striking
distance early, began to fade after a half. ALTAR GIRL broke back and was never a threat. DOUGHTY came out soon after the start to bother SASSY
LASS, trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
SUN THUNDER steadied in tight quarters into the first turn, two path through that bend, moved out, strong move four wide into contention second bend,
took over and won going away under an aggressive hand ride. KING RUSSELL squeezed back at the start, lacked speed, well back, steered five to six wide
into the stretch, rallied to be well clear for the place, not a threat to the winner. SEAS OF NORMANDY chased the early leader just off the inside, advanced
and vied late backstretch, held a slight advantage midway on the turn, proved no match for the top pair in the drive, remained well clear of the others.
WINNEMAC AVENUE in the second flight off the inside and three wide first turn, four wide second bend, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing
bid. MILLERS RITE away in good order clear through the first turn, set a pressured pace up most of the backstretch, began to weaken when headed far
turn. THE HEIGHTS forward an inside through the first turn, fell back a bit in the two path into the far turn, went evenly through the stretch. RUNNIN' BLOCK
void of speed, continued well back the middle half, improved position in the three path while never dangerous. PROFOUND IMPACT four wide when with
the second flight into the first turn, lodged a three wide middle move to contend into the final turn, faltered in the drive. HARD TO COME BY brush at the
break, lacked speed three wide, failed to menace. MY SPIRIT bothered into the first turn, moved inside and steadied midway on that bend, moved closer the
middle half then gave way when the real running began second turn. MACHO VILLA in tight entering the first turn, gave after a half, stopped, jogged in.
MOON OVER DUBAI broke out, stopped after half, distanced after losing contact with the field, also jogged in.

Footnotes
KING PEANUT in the second flight between horses, briefly waited in some traffic early in the turn, recovered and steered out four wide when advancing late
in the bend, took over nearing the furlong marker, quickly clear. STUCK N SNOW pressed the issue up the backstretch outside, vied three wide through the
turn, briefly dueled with the winner upper stretch then proved no match, fully extended to hold the place. CHUPAPI MUNYAYO off a step slow, settled well
off the pace outside, three wide into the lane, finished willingly to be getting to the runner up late. PEARCY ROAD off slowly, well back early outside, came
four wide for the drive, displayed some late interest but did not have enough for the place. MIRI A COINCIDENCE dueled up front in the two path
backstretch, continued to vie while between rivals turn, faltered in the drive. K J'S LEGACY set or forced the pace closest to the inside for a half and also
weakened into the stretch. BLACK APPLE void of early foot, improved slightly while never posing a serious threat. EMPYREAL SHADOW came in just after
the start to bother an inner rival then made little other impact in an even effort. READY SHOES broke in and then steadied to be away slowly, trailed far
back, picked off some tiring rivals off the inside after the issue had been decided. LANGUILLE RIVER off a step slow, remained always back. HE'S RICH in
the second flight early toward the inside, gave way. CADILLAC COWBOY staged a steady retreat while just off the inside.

FROSTED DEPARTURE away in good order, closest to the leader toward the inside up the backstretch, challenged between horses turn, three path then
brushed slightly with the runner up entering the stretch, switched to a left handed stick inside the furlong grounds, drifted out slightly floating that same foe a
bit, outgamed that one in the waning strides. TWO EAGLES RIVER bobbled to be off a step slow, moved up the opening quarter off the inside, three wide
bid late in the turn, brushed with the winner upper stretch, dueled past the furlong marker, floated out a bit late to narrowly miss. BOURBON BASH outrun
early, second flight into the turn, steadied briefly early in the bend, moved out for the drive after recovering, finished willingly to be slowly carving into the
margin of the top two. COUNT DE MONET broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, continued to show the way early turn, faltered when headed by the top
two into the stretch, continued to weaken to lose the show with a furlong remaining. CHOCTAW ZIP in the second flight off the inside, floated out four wide
into the stretch, had little left for the stretch run. SPURRIER fell back to trail after the start and was never involved.

Footnotes
TWIRLED with the pace outside, put a head in front three wide late in the turn, edged clear upper stretch and maintained daylight to the wire under stedy
handling. KEY TO SUCCESS void of speed for three furlongs along the inside, steered out turning for home, rallied from between foes past the furlong
marker and finished willingly to be clear for the place. PIONEER PARADE forwardly placed early off the inside, angled in, fell back a bid and dropped all the
way to the rail midway on the turn, could do little with the winner through lane nor could she contain the runner up, narrowly saved the show. YOLANDA
WHO brolke out, was straightened, within striking distance early, shuffled back in traffic nearing the half mile marker, came three wide into the lane and
finished up evenly to miss the show. SALTWATER GYPSY in mid pack early, four wide into the lane, lacked a closing punch. GOLDBLOODED lacked early
foot, continued one paced while four wide through the turn, failed to rally. BEAUTIFUL AND BOLD failed to menace while racing three wide. PROUD MULE
narrowly showed the way up the backstretch inside, moved out a bit when holding a small lead midway on the turn, faltered in the drive.
STEPONTHEFOOTFEET fell back to trail far back, well beaten. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH,
NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
DEAR LADY stalked the pace while three wide up the backstretch, crept a bit closer on the outside late in the turn, engaged the leader past the furlong
marker, drove clear. INTO LOVE broke very sharp, cleared while angling toward the inside, showed the way through the turn toward the rail, offered brief
resistance to the winner midstretch, could not match strides with that one late, clearly second best. PEACE CRUISER broke out, was straightened to settle
in mid pack and outside, continued three wide through the turn, rallied mildly to be up late for the show, not a threat to the top two. BARSTOOL BABE
outrun early, remained back in the two path through the turn, improved with a late rally, split foes late, missed the show. RUBIA behind the leaders while
inside, continued to save ground turn, lacked a closing response finish up in flat fashion. MALIBU TOAST pressed the pace in the two path up the
backstretch, continued to apply pressure turn, had little left for the stretch run and lost a couple of positions late in tiring. PERFECT PRINCESS broke back,
void of speed, four wide into the stretch, lacked a closing response. COLLECTED GLORY back in the pack, waited toward the inside midway on the turn,
two path into the lane, also lacked a closing bid. PACIFIC VIEW off a step slow, three wide into the lane, remained back. GOLDENSHUGA was finished
after a half.

Footnotes
DEFINING PURPOSE broke with the leaders, pulled while immediately behind the first flight, crept closer before a half, lacked clear room, pulled out and
moved out four wide late backstretch, ranged up to challenge far turn, took over, quickly clear under a single right handed crop to win ridden out in a sharp
effort. UNIFYING narrowly showed the way for five furlongs inside and under restraint, headed and fell back second turn, moved off the inside for the drive,
came back for the place and held that position in the late going while not a threat to the winner. TAKE CHARGE BRIANA void of early foot, remained back
the middle half, two to three wide turning for home, rallied and was getting to the runner up late while posing no threat to the winner. TAXED with the first
flight between foes and outside the runner up, briefly took over from that one midway on the second turn, offered little resistance to the winner soon after,
gradually weakened through the lane to lose two positions the final furlong. BLUELIGHTSPECIAL broke on top, four wide into the first turn, continued in mid
pack, two path second turn, lacked a finishing kick. NEED SOME MONEY broke back, dropped to the inside into the first turn to save ground, continued
inside, two path into the lane, not dangerous. CHARLEE MAE in the main body, moved out and was four wide through the second turn, also failed to
produce a rally. FABULOUS CANDY last away, was never a threat while racing three wide. MIDNIGHT HEIRESS pressured the pace from the three path
for five furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
EYEING CLOVER broke well from between horses, showed the way early, shook briefly clear into the turn, responded when confronted by the runner up
late in the bend, dueled upper stretch and the edged clear the final furlong in a determined effort. EASY ACTION broke on top, pressed the winner three
wide, tried that one from the outside late in the turn, dueled into the lane, denied, clearly second best. BEN'S LEGACY off a step slow, raced back early,
swung four wide into the lane when advancing, no match for the top two, edging clear for the show. SOYBEAN MAN in the second group just off the inside,
asked along three wide turning into the stretch, also had little for the top two the final furlong, outkicked for the show. STRAY CAT bothered at the start,
settled in mid pack off the inside, came three wide for the drive when making a mild advance, went evenly through the stretch in lacking a closing kick.
INTERLOCK EMPIRE in mid pack toward the inside, raced in traffic late in the turn in the two path, went one paced through the stretch when clear.
SWAGGISH with the early leaders outside the winner, began to weaken in the turn. BUBBA CAN DANCE off a step slow, raced back, picked off a couple of
tiring rivals while never a threat. PINE COVE bothered to be off slow, remained back in failing to menace while well off the inside. WOODY'S CHOICE
angled in early when racing forward early, backed up through the stretch. DOUBLE STRIKE was never a threat in remaining always back. EYE AM SMART
forwardly placed early, in tight, checked up with five furlongs remaining, fell back and trailed home. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING
THE RUN UP THE BACKSTRETCH, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
