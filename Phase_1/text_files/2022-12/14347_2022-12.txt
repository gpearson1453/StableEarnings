Footnotes
DREAMING ALWAYS was unhurried into stride, wheeled out four wide entering the stretch, was left with a daunting task leaving the three-sixteenths pole,
quickened in the final furlong, reeled in the leader and drew clear late. ELLIE DELI was away alertly, angled in to set the pace, was collared after a half,
turned back the bid of UNDER THE BED leaving the second turn, shook clear entering the lane, kept on well but was no match for the winner in the final
yards. UNDER THE BED tracked the leader off of the inside, moved up to engage the leader, but flattened leaving the second turn and settled for the minor
award. PRANA was allowed to settle, moved up three wide to make a mild bid, but failed to sustain the drive. MORIARTY failed to respond. CHARACTER
COUNTS was hung wide and was never a factor. GRANDPAPPY'S DREAM settled between horses in the second flight, but lacked a response when called
upon. YOU'RE A DANDY saved ground to no avail. CAUGHTINMYWEB dropped well back at once and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
BOURBON TRAFFIC broke awkwardly to get away behind his field, was unhurried into stride, came under a ride midway through the turn, looped into the
stretch seven wide, engulfed the field, drifted in while clearing through the final sixteenth. GOLDEN SURVIVOR was forwardly placed along the inside, got
through and loomed a danger but was out kicked. BRONZE BEAST tracked three deep, came to level terms between foes entering the stretch, but flattened
in the final furlong. EYEOFTHEBEHOLDER was unhurried, circled six wide to make a mild bid, but lacked the needed late response. FOMO came away in
good order, set the pace off of the inside, was collared between rivals leaving the turn and gave in. SONGWRITER was allowed to settle, ranged into
striking distance on the turn, but came up empty entering the stretch. TRIPLE CHROME contended between horses, shifted out leaving the turn, but lacked
a response when asked. FROOME (IRE) failed to make headway. CONGRATS FOR GLORY was close up inside leaving the chute, tipped out and
advanced between runners into the turn, but tired leaving the quarter pole and faded. WE THANK YOU saved ground but was never a factor.

GOSHEN prompted the pace while four wide early, was cued to bid three wide turning into the lane, took over in upper stretch and held sway. SATIS trailed
from inside early, shifted out to the eight path for a clear run at the top of the stretch, and rallied down the center for place honors. CONNELMAURA stalked
along the inside, was roused to bid between foes midway around the turn, and kept on in the stretch for show. CAPTIVE STAR was coaxed along in the two

Footnotes
SNAKE BITE tracked in the two path, shifted in and was roused to bid through an opening on the rail around the far turn, took the lead into the lane and held
gamely. NOT SO EASY was unhurried along the inside into the first turn, moved up while three wide around the far turn, took aim under coaxing from the
five path at the top of the stretch and ran on for place. AUTHORITARIAN stalked from the three path, moved up to bid rounding the far turn, and kept on in
the stretch to hold show. LINK TO DESTINY raced from wellback in the four path, swung out to the eight path into the stretch, and stayed on. RAL
COPPERHEADROAD prompted the pace from inside, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but finished evenly. RAULITO was held up in the five
path, floated out to the seven path entering the lane, but flattened. FARZIN raced from off the pace while three wide, was short of room at the top of the
stretch, and was no factor. GOOD FIRST trailed from the two path early and was never a threat. MIGHTY CRAIC raced in midpack while three wide, was
driven from the six path into the stretch, but weakened. BARSTOW pressed the pace from two wide but gaveway at the top of the lane. CHIEF HOWCOME
was held up while three wide but was tired going into the far turn. KICK IT CHARLIE set the pace from inside but yielded going into the far turn.

Footnotes
SARGEANT BARGER set the pace under a snug hold from the rail, was cued to open up from the two path turning into the lane, and held clear. CASPER
JUSTICE steadied at the start and raced in midpack from the three path, was ridden four wide around the turn, swung out to the six path into the stretch,
and ran on for place. OFFICIAL BUSINESS tracked in the three path, was ridden into the stretch, and held on to show. BEOCCA raced from wellback in the
two path, shifted out to the eight path entering the lane, and was gaining late. STUBBORNKINDAFELLA was held up from the two path, cut the corner into
the stretch, but finished evenly. WIMOWEH raced in midfield from the four path, was driven from the six path into the lane, but flattened. MASETA stalked
from inside early but backed up between foes turning into the stretch. LIBERTY BLUE prompted the pace from the two path but yielded going into the
stretch. DOWN TO BIZZNESS bumped at the start and trailed along the inside early, and never factored. LAND REMEMBERED raced from behind in the
three path and was unable to challenge. ROUNDER raced off the pace in the four path and never threatened. WEAPON rated form inside but was no
menace.

Footnotes
BALI BELLE chased from inside, was cued to bid from the rail in upper stretch, and drew past in the final furlong. TWILA MAE rated in the two path, was
roused around the far turn, tipped out to the five path in the final furlong and ran on for place. IDIOMATIC prompted the pace from two wide, bid from the
three path into the lane, wandered about passing the eighth pole, and hung to show. BIRTHDAY TIME stalked from inside, shifted out to the six path
entering the lane, and evened out late. SENSITIVITY raced from wellback in the four path, tucked inside around the far turn, and moved up from the rail in
the stretch. MIRTH 'N MERRIMENT was unhurried between rivals early, was ridden from the two path into the stretch, and finished evenly. MAYBE LATER
tracked from three wide, swung out to the eight path into the lane but was one paced. TWO SIXTYONE set the pace from inside, was coaxed turning into
the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. UNDER ONE SKY stalked the pace from the five path but was tired entering the stretch. PRINCESS NINA raced
in midpack from the six path but was empty going into the lane. ELUSIVE JUSTICE was held up between rivals but was tired around the far turn. CRYSTAL
