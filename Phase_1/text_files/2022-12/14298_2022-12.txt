Footnotes
CHARLI MICHAEL cleared approaching the half mile pole, set the pace inside of pressers turning for home, responded readily when set down in upper
stretch, shook clear, and was ridden out. CRUSADER EXPRESS laid off of the pace along the inside, improved while shifting two wide entering the lane,
tipped three wide in upper stretch, ran on to bid for place inside the final furlong, and reached that position at the sixteenth pole. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER
stalked two wide, pressed turning for home, but failed to keep pace leaving the quarter pole, chased while hanging on his left lead, but lost place a sixteenth
from home. BOOTSIE'S GALAXY laid off of the pace four wide, got herded to the seven path in upper stretch, and lacked a rally. PERFECT PERIGEE
broke in and bumped a rival at the start, stalked along the inside, but failed to progress in upper stretch before fading. WICKED ALEX raced at the rear three
wide, and failed to factor. DONNA'S COURT took a bump from an outer rival at the start, chased from midpack along the inside, allowed an inner rival to slip
through at the three furlong pole, and faded. THUNK tracked three wide, but faded entering the lane, and gave way while drifting out in upper stretch.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT DREAMING prompted the pace three wide and between horses, vied among rivals around the turn, forged an advantage entering the lane,
drove clear approaching midstretch, and just lasted from an outer bidder to the wire. GIANNIS tracked from behind the leading quartet as the rest of the field
vied for the lead around the turn, altered course outside of them at the furlong grounds, then offered a late kick in hopes of reeling in the clear leader at the
wire, but narrowly missed. JARED THE WARRIOR stalked four wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, but lugged in slightly at the quarter pole while failing to
keep pace with an inner rival, chased that foe thereafter, and lost place to an outer rival a sixteenth from home. HOLY PRINCE vied for the lead inside of a
trio of rivals around the turn, and yielded in upper stretch. WINNING DANCE sparred for the lead two wide and between horses, but weakened in upper
stretch.

then stayed on after shifting further out in the final furlong, but failed to reach place. BOOTDADDY JUSTICE bumped an outer rival soon after the start,
tracked along the inside, tipped two wide in upper stretch, and chased evenly while lacking a punch to bid. TIZ LIGHT THE WAY took bumps from rivals on
both sides soon after the start, lagged behind around the turn, and improved. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) vied for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but
weakened at the quarter pole. HUG THE MUNNY bumped an inner rival in the opening stages, laid off of the pace three to four wide, and got outrun.

Footnotes
MARINA'S GOLD set the pace, shook free to a loose margin with a half mile to go, showed the way while in control around the far turn, and increased her
margin under driving pressure through midstretch. MORE ROMANCE leaned out and brushed a rival at the start, rated at the rear along the inside, offered a
quick gain inside of foes around the far turn to claim place at the quarter pole, but failed to threaten the leader through the lane. SWIZZLECITY tracked from
midpack along the inside while a bit off of the rail, got outmoved by an inner foe around the far turn while tipping to the three path, then drifted to the five
path entering the lane, and ran on. CANDY'S PARADE stalked outside of the pace setter, chased that clear foe around the far turn, but weakened turning
for home. XCARET raced in midpack four to five wide, and made little impact. TWELVE STARS was brushed by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start,
settled off of the pace two wide, then three wide among foes around the far turn, yet yielded turning for home. JIBE took a light nudge from an inner rival in
the opening stages, tracked three wide, but faded four wide and between horses around the far turn.

Footnotes
SWEET SLEW cleared an inner rival at the nine sixteenths pole, showed the way along the inside while rating back to the field around the turn, then
responded readily when let out entering the lane, drew off passing the quarter pole, and was ridden out under light urging. ROLL GYPSY ROLL lagged
behind entering the turn, then rallied along the fence while hanging on her left lead to reach place inside the final furlong. MY LADY LUNA tracked three
wide and between horses, bid for place while spinning to the four path entering the lane, vied for that position while chasing the clear leader through
midstretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival nearing the final sixteenth. KEEP LEFT tracked along the inside, vied for place in the two path entering the
lane, but yielded between horses in midstretch. CHAMPLEVE laid off of the pace four to five wide, and made little impact. STOP THE MADNESS lacked
speed in the two path, and never got involved. CORONA DEL MAR pressed along the inside in the opening stages before deciding to stalk outside of vying
counterpart passing the nine sixteenths pole, stalked two wide and among rivals turning for home, but weakened in the three path and between horses
passing the quarter pole, and drifted out in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead.

Footnotes
RELEASE MCCRAKEN prompted the pace inside of a pair of foes, vied around the turn, dueled with DISTORTED PRO while wrestling an advantage in
upper stretch, then shifted out slightly and brushed his counterpart at the sixteenth pole, and held gamely. DISTORTED PRO set the pace two wide and
between a pair a sternly pressing rivals, sparred with his inner counterpart entering the lane, fought on after being headed in upper stretch, took a light brush
while not losing momentum at the sixteenth pole, and was kept at bay to the wire. TODDCHERO tracked in the three to four paths, then stayed on in pursuit
of the dueling pair through the lane, and grinded away at their margin while hanging on his left lead. BELLO CREEDO laid off of the pace in the five path,
but lugged out turning for home, came into the lane in the eight path, and made little impact. TOP NOTE leaned out at the start and bumped the starting
gate, then trailed, and never got involved. GALLANT BUCK pressed three wide, but weakened entering the lane. THE RIDER OF DISTORED PRO
CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF RELEASE MCCRAKEN FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS
DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

TAPIT SHOES settled off of the pace two wide, improved to a tracking position nearing the far turn, pursued the leaders under urging while in the two path
around that bend, tipped four wide and ranged up entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, then drove clear while lugging inwardly and across a rival's path
approaching the furlong grounds, shied from a left handed crop at that juncture causing him to wander about momentarily, and finished up willingly after the
rider put the stick away nearing the final sixteenth. MORE THAN FIVE set the pace inside of a prompting rival, sparred with that foe around the far turn,
disposed him before meeting Z Z'S PRINCE's bid entering the lane, dueled with that foe before being swiftly outkicked by an outer bidder in midstretch, and
fought on to regain place. Z Z'S PRINCE stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid entering the lane, vied in upper
stretch, but proved no match for an outer bidder coming to the furlong grounds, altered course outside of that lugging foe at that marker, flopped back to his
left lead soon after, and yielded. DUAL MONARCHY laid far back along the inside, improved in the four path around the far turn, and stayed on. GEM
COLLECTION raced in midpack three wide, but failed to menace. GORDY'S LABEL tracked in midpack two wide and between horses, but weakened at the
three furlong pole, had his outer hind quarters bumped and heels clipped by an outer rival nearing the lane, yet sustained stride after shifting out in upper
stretch, and surpassed tired rivals in midstretch. ICE TIME rated at the rear along the inside, tipped three wide at the five sixteenths pole, but shifted in and
clipped an inner rival's heels approachong the lane. and made little impact. BAYOU CHROME tracked in midpack along the inside, but faded around the far
turn. NATURAL RED settled far back two wide, then took the far turn in the four path, and was outrun. BLANTON vied for the lead two wide, but weakened
between horses at the five sixteenths pole, and stopped.

Footnotes
OEUVRE bumped an outer rival soon after the start, pressed three wide, bid in upper stretch, dueled through midstretch, wrestled an advantage nearing the
sixteenth pole, and held from an outer bidder late. PORTILLA trailed two wide, shifted five wide in upper stretch, rallied in pursuit of the top pair in the final
furlong, but belatedly reached place while running out of ground to reel in the leader. PERFECT HAPPINESS dueled for the lead two wide and between
horses, sparred gamely through upper stretch, but was headed by her outer counterpart at the sixteenth pole, and got nailed at the wire for place. TOUCH
OF CLASS took bumps from rivals on both sides at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. NEW BOSS dueled for the lead inside of a
pair of foes, but yielded at the furlong grounds, and faltered. CASHABLE bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked in the two path, tipped outside of the top
trio entering the lane, but failed to change leads, lacked a kick, and gave way. ELLE'S TOWN pressed four wide, but caved while drifting to the six path
entering the lane.

Footnotes
MISHPACHAH set the pace inside of a pressing foe, shook clear entering the lane, and held late from an outer bidder. VALE MALE broke out at the start,
tracked three wide, rallied through the final furlong to take aim on the clear leader late, but was fended off. MY FRIEND MR. JIM broke a step slow before
being floated outwardly by an inner foe at the start, was void of speed while remaining in the five path around both turns, then stayed on to reach show at
the wire. MEDLEY pressed two wide, but gave way at the quarter pole. SHELLI'S ANGEL laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the three
path, and stayed on between horses to miss reaching show. SERAPE stalked along the inside, but yielded through the final furlong. MISS KENNEDY lacked
speed two wide before taking the inside path around the far turn, and made little impact. OURS AND THEIRS failed to factor from the three to four paths.
IRON BANNER was outrun. LADY CHURCHILL tracked in the two path, but wilted entering the far turn, and was eased through the lane.
