throughout, came again late and was gaining on the winner. JEBIP was allowed to settle early, rallied on the far turn while between horses, angled out in the
stretch and weakened slightly. CRYPTO COPY was well placed on the inside and and went evenly late. MONSTER HUNTER raced mid pack and was no
threat. POWERFUL PHIL set a pressured pace for three quarters, then gave way. KISSINGER was unhurried early, swung wide in the stretch and was no
menace. DYNAMIC REACH was outrun. The rider of JEBIP claimed foul against the rider of WILD OX for alleged interference in the stretch. After viewing
the tape the stewards took no action
