Footnotes
TRAPPEZOID led the field from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around
the far turn, dueled with a rival in upper stretch and edged clear in the final furlong. SNAP HOOK saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up
the backstretch, began a bid from the rail coming off the second turn, dueled in upper stretch and could not go with the winner late, but kept on to the wire,
the best of the rest. ESPECIALLEA trailed the field from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in
the two path around the second bend and finished evenly from there. TAPSOLUTE was off slow and checked leaving the gate, raced in the four path around
the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three and four path and was
outkicked in the lane. EL PILLO raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty in
the stretch. SHAKEM N BREAKEM saved ground around the first turn, raced at the back of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save

Footnotes
CAMPTOWN RACES raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path approaching the quarter pole,
dueled down the lane and just got his head in front for the win. CREATIVE CLOUD stalked the pace setter on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, challenged from the three path coming around the turn and dueled down the stretch to just miss. SHIMMERING LIGHT tracked the leader on the
inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the bend, swung wide into the stretch and kept on to the wire. DIVINE CONTROL raced off the
pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. MISTA DONZELLA led the field on the inside up the
backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final sixteenth of a mile. FREELANCE raced at the back of the pack on the
outside through the opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the four path and never threatened. CREATIVE CHOICE trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and was empty in the stretch. JAMA DILLON flipped his head up at the break, recovered to press the
pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend and tired in the lane.
