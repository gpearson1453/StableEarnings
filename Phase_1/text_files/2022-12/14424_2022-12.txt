Footnotes
FREEDOMFI tracked the leader from the two path moved to engage leader at the quarter pole and took the lead at the three sixteenths pole and drew clear.
CHAOSMOS was hustled to the lead from the inside to the final turn then was headed and weakened but able to hold the place. BASSETT saved ground
most of the way then angled out in early stretch and was up for the show. MEDITATE stalked the pace to the final turn from the three path made a bid into
the stretch but failed to menace. OCTOBER SURPRISE was unhurried and never a factor. WAYPOINT was allowed to settle made a mild bid on the first
and second turn then dropped back. ITS A CITY DAY was rank early and settled near the back then went five wide in the second turn but had no impact.

missed. BROAD DECISION was unhurried around the first turn and down the backstretch made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late rally. BOLD

turn then rushed up the rail and finished evenly. RUBIGINOUS raced in the middle of the pack from three to four wide then made a four wide mild bid on the
backstretch and weakened. DUSTY BOY raced near the back and failed to menace. CUSTOMIZE MY QUEST was always back. CAEUS IN PASADENA

steadily advanced up the rail and chased the winner home. PLAY MASTER was placed close up in the two path and was no match for the top two.
SHANKINSTINE was four wide into the first turn then tracked the leaders from the three path but never made a bid. K V TARGET went five wide into the
first turn, was forwardly placed throughout but had no response. KAT'S SOLDIER was always back. CUSTOM DANCER was within striking distance around

Footnotes
DIANNA'S JET went to the front to set all the pace from the inside and held on late. A WISH FOR MADELYN raced in the middle for the pace from three to
four wide down the backstretch then went five wide into the final turn but couldn't catch the leader and proved second best. COUNTRY DREAM was allowed
to settle around the first turn then steadily advanced up the rail to be best of the rest. PHILLY WINS tracked the leaders from the three path to the final turn,
faded and finished evenly. MISS BILLIE K was within striking distance from the three path around the first turn, made a mild bid on the backstretch and tired.
GINNY B was forwardly placed in the two path around the first turn then settled in the middle of the pack through the final turn, went four wide in upper
stretch but had no response. LOVE TO LEARN was placed close up early and failed to menace. BE A BANDIT was in the middle of the pack in the three
path and not a threat. PRETTY PRODUCTION trailed.
