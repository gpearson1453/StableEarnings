Footnotes
PHRA PHROM , off the pace under some early rating while saving ground, eased out leaving the far turn, edged up four wide into the lane, closed steadily
under left handed asking, took over between runners in deep stretch and prevailed. CELTIC COUSEN , hard urged and not really responding leaving the far
turn, picked things up while being angled five wide into the lane, rallied in tandem and outside the winner in mid stretch, challenged for command inside the
sixteenth marker, dueled late and missed. TAKE CHARGE TOO disputed the early pace three deep then cleared off into the turn, widened a bit while two
wide under some rating past the five sixteenths, remained clear under asking leaving mid stretch, dug in when confronted then gave way grudgingly through
the final yards. FIND FAITH vied between runners early on, dropped in towards the rail to pursue around the turn, stayed inside but lacked a serious finish.
FLAVIAN , off the pace, lost ground four wide mid turn, angled wider for the drive but failed to rally. ARDEN'SLUCKYTOBE broke a bit slow, showed an
early burst and moved up between foes, stalked outside a rival mid turn and weakened. LUV YA BYE BYE flashed speed inside and contested the early
pace, failed to keep up leaving the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
BIGMANCAN broke slowly, was taken to the inner rail mid way on the turn, found room inside horses through the stretch, gained the lead inside the
sixteenth pole and drove clear. GIRLS LOVE ME , in narrow quarters along the inner rail near the three eighths pole, swung to the five path inside the three
sixteenths pole and rallied late. NOTTOWAY , three deep around the turn, chased the pace, was well positioned in upper stretch and flattened out. YES SIR
ROBERT saved ground on the turn setting a pressured pace, drifted to the two path in upper stretch and weakened late. DR. RUSTY RAYMOND , five deep
leaving the turn, floated to the seven path in mid stretch and passed tired horses. THE CAIRO KID prompted the pace outside YES SIR ROBERT and gave
way the final furlong. HE'S A SHOOTER was outrun. PEPE AND HEYWOOD briefly chased the early pace, was four wide leaving the turn and gave way.
PER RULING #23-001 FROM THE MARYLAND RACING COMMISSION, GIRLS LOVE ME WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM 2nd TO UNPLACED DUE TO A

Footnotes
BONDED , off the pace while saving ground, was under asking from the far turn, eased out a path then gained between rivals to get in range soon into the
lane, shifted out, closed in under a drive to engage the leader leaving mid stretch, forged clear with a sixteenth to go and drew out under encouragement.
WHISKEY MISCHIEF , soundly bumped at the break, recovered and sped up between foes to take command, cleared leaving the chute and set a rated
pace towards the rail, kept on under pressure nearing mid stretch, wandered outward once engaged, continued to drift out but stayed on with effort to be
clearly second best. SIGMUND broke outward at the break and bumped with WHISKEY MISCHIEF, corrected and edged up to prompt the pace towards the
inside, eased out into the lane and continued on with effort. SLINGSHOT BOY stalked outside a rival, was under coaxing mid turn, shifted four wide for the
drive but one paced through the final furlong. I AM THE MIKE bobbled at the break, settled well back after recovering, came four to five wide for the drive
and had belated action. RASCALLY REBEL , off the early pace and off the inside, edged up between rivals mid turn, angled five wide with some run into the
lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. BULLOUT lagged back and was not a factor. SNIP THE ROSES , four wide outside rivals with some early
pursuit, lacked a punch past the three eighths and gave way. POINT US HOME saved ground, edged up a bit nearing the half mile marker, failed to kick on
entering the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
REDWHITEANDTACOS bore out leaving the starting gate, raced three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gained the lead outside foes in upper
stretch, was kept to his business and drew off. HOV LANE made the early lead, saved ground around the turn setting a pressured pace, came out for the
drive, failed to hold off the winner and gamely held the place. SWEET SENSATION prompted the pace racing between horses around the turn and
weakened in the drive. BELLA BETTINA , in the two path stalking the pace around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and gave way. LUCKY
LORRAINE , outside horses in the stretch, passed tired ones. EARLEY ROSE , along the inner rail on the turn, chased the pace to the stretch and gave
way. BLAME THE IRISH was not a factor. SEMIRAMIS , very wide on the turn, was not a factor. RATIONALMILLENNIAL drifted very wide entering the
stretch and retreated. LOTTACLASS LILSASS , outrun, was widest in the stretch. MI YAYIS dropped back and was eased.

Footnotes
IMAGINE IT ALL prompted pace the pace two to three wide, bid between foes nearing mid stretch, gained a short lead with a sixteenth to go, dueled to the
inside of CAPTAIN QUINT from there and dug in tenaciously under left handed asking to prevail. CAPTAIN QUINT , bumped at the break, raced four wide
outside rivals early, took closer order after a half mile, angled out a bit wider into lane, moved up to take command under asking in mid stretch, fought
gamely outside the winner through the final yards but wasn't quite good enough. LUIGI'S SPIRIT , bumped at the break, drafted back leaving the chute and
settled off the inside, moved up four wide mid turn, angled six wide with aim into the lane, kept grinding on his left lead and steadily gained. GRAND
MANNER , between rivals with pursuit, dropped in and edged up into the lane, loomed a presence along the rail in mid stretch but failed to follow through.
MOSES WATER sped clear early, set the pace off the rail, took pressure soon into the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way. ESPRESSO LUNGO
checked when shuffled back leaving the chute, lagged off the pace, was under a ride leaving the far turn but failed to respond. DEVIL'S CANYON saved
ground, raced in range for a half then gave way. NOTIMELIKEPRESENT , bumped at the break, stalked the early pace four wide, failed to go on leaving the
far turn and faltered.

Footnotes
SPARKLE SPRINKLE sped to the early lead, saved ground around the turn, hugged the inner rail in the stretch and was under brisk urging in mid stretch.
I'M GITTIN THERE , two wide around the turn, chased the winner in a game effort. SHE IS WISKY lacked speed, swung to the four path in upper stretch
and offered a mild rally. UTTERLY COURAGEOUS circled rivals on the turn, was fanned five deep in upper stretch and passed tired foes. RUNUP , two
wide on the turn, angled to the three path in upper stretch and gave way. SISTER SUPREAM , steadied when shuffled back soon after the break, hugged
the inner rail around the turn, gave way and was eased late. R B'S STAR chased the pace racing along the inner rail around the turn, faltered and was
eased late.

Footnotes
ICY STARE DOWN cleared in the opening sixteenth without much effort, dropped in towards the rail and set the pace, was knuckled on around the turn,
responded when put to firm asking leaving the three sixteenths, steadily widened and was kept alert to the wire. SMART EULEE edged up between foes
early, chased three wide into the lane and kept on with good energy to gain the place. WINKED stalked the winner off the inside, was under pressure into
the lane, stayed on to mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. WICKED HOT broke a step slow, rated off the pace, came three wide into the lane, shifted out
but lacked a bid. LADRO DI FICHI , three to four wide, failed to respond. MURPH saved ground, pursued to upper stretch then faded. GUSTAV'S GIRL ,
four wide while off the pace, faltered nearing the lane and was eased through the drive.

and drifted out near the sixteenth pole. ARROGANT RIDER , steadied when pinched back leaving the starting gate, was four wide entering the stretch.
