Footnotes
TEMPTED MISSION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and up in the closing
yards. TWICE FOOLED was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. PRECEDENT broke sharply to set a
pressured pace, responded when challenged by ROYAL JOKER nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear margin with a sixteenth to run but could
not hold the top pair safe late. ROYAL JOKER was away in good order to press the pace of PRECENDENT while racing three-wide, moved up to engage
that rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way through the final furlong. BET ON DAD was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the
turn and gave way in the drive. TENTH STREET DON showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and
was not a factor. ROBIN'S EMPIRE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.

Footnotes
PAISLEY'S VISION pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole, opened a clear lead into the lane and
drew off with complete authority. TOP HAT TIGRESS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with good energy. THE
COMRIE RULE raced off the leaders from the inside, moved up for a striking position and failed to gain in the drive. LOTSA LOU was away in good order to
chase the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. AUTISM EXCELLENCE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and finished evenly. DAHLIA'S DANCER set a pressured pace from the inside and gave way through
the final furlong. WEST COAST ANDY was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. GOLDEN RACHEL lacked early foot,
raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SWISS WHISKEY lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not. REASON TWO
LIVE was off slow, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. RUNAWAY ANNIE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and
did not menace.

Footnotes
ATOMIC CANDY sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, responded when challenged by RIVER ROSE nearing the quarter,
re-cleared with a furlong to run and was fully extended to hold MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) safe late. MACEDONIAN RULER (AUS) lacked early speed,
saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy. RIVER ROSE pressed the pace of the winner while
racing three-wide, moved up to engage that rival nearing the quarter and failed to sustain his bid in the drive. PALACE PRINCE raced four-wide through the
first turn, lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. OF GOOD REPORT was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide
through the second turn and failed to rally. MANY ROSES chased the leaders from between foes and weakened after going three-quarters. WRAPPED
lagged throughout and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
REIGN OF FIRE stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out further into the stretch, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and quickly drew off.
CLUBHOUSE SAINT settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and rallied late to gain the place. SONGOFTHEDESERT sprinted clear
soon after the start, raced three-wide while setting the pace, increased her margin into the lane and gave way through the final sixteenth.
SHESAHEATWAVE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole when between rivals and
finished evenly when clear. MEAN SHARON was off slow, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late
response. APRILINTHEPINES raced off the leaders throughout and failed to rally. MULLIGAN was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually
weakened. TWIRLY GIRL was void of early foot, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BONITA RAPIDS lacked early speed, raced six-wide
through the turn and did not offer a bid. MY EXPRESSION showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. THE RIDER OF
SHESAHEATWAVE LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST CLUBHOUSE SAINT CONCERNING THE STEADYING OF HIS MOUNT AT THE
THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.
