pole, challenged while racing from the inside in the drive and finished gamely to the wire. BOSSY CAT chased the top pair down the backstretch, raced from
the outside in the stretch run and kept on to the wire. PRINCIPALITY raced off the early pace, was near the inside into the upper stretch and lacked a rally.

HEIR PORT showed good early foot to set the pace from the inside of rival and held gamely under strong pressure. TOMMY THE TORCH stalked the pace,
raced from the inside around the far turn, angled out and surged in the final stages from the outside and got up for the place position. MARTINKELLY
pressed the early leader from the outside and finished willingly to the wire. LITTLE DEMON settled off the early going, raced between around the far turn
and lacked a rally. ANNAMATED MOON raced off the early pace, was four deep around the far turn and lost ground while tiring in the drive.

checked early on due to fallen rival, made a five wide bid around the far turn and finished gamely to the wire while racing from the outside. NECCO showed
good early foot from the inside, led near the half mile pole and weakened. LA PAZ was sent early from the outside and had not enough. SUMMER MIST
view obstructed due to fog. RAY OF LIGHT view obstructed due to fog. SUNSHINE JACK veered out near in the early stages near the eleven sixteenths

Footnotes
DEVOTED KITTEN raced off the early pace, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished well to be clear under strong pressure. EDICT tracked
the early pace from the inside, raced three deep between rivals near the quarter pole and finished second best. SACRED MOUNTAIN was sent along early
from the outside, raced four wide near the quarter pole and kept on to the wire. BANANAS ON FIRE was rated along early, raced from the inside around the
far turn and had no late response. ALL TACKED UP showed good early foot from the inside and gave way. DIAMOND SETTER dropped back early and
failed to respond.
