drive but finished well to hold the place. MISS MALIA was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing four-wide, gave way to the top pair after
going a half but stayed on well in the drive. MY FIRST PEARL showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly. BOOZE
RUNNER lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LAST PUNCH chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened

HARD KNOCKS was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but was clearly
second best. BLAZINGBELLABLU showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late.

through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and did not offer a bid. A ROZE AND WINE showed brief speed and weakened. FINAL TIME

Footnotes
HEART ON THE RUN was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside, opened a clear lead nearing the quarter and drew off with complete
authority. BIG BLUE NOTE pressed the pace of the winner from the inside, angled out into the stretch, was no match for the winner but finished well to hold
the place. CHA showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late. MISTY MATT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and failed to threaten. A WHOLE LOTTA HULA was hustled along then checked nearing the three-eighths pole, angled out into the lane
and lacked the needed closing response. LOW DOSE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SHE'S BLUE DIAMOND
showed brief speed, raced six-wide through the turn and weakened.

turn, angled out further into the lane and finished with late interest. DON'T GET PICKLED raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn,
angled out in mid-stretch and finished evenly. CREME DE MENTHE pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. RICHARDSBRIGHTSTAR lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
MODERA lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
BELLS AND WHISTLES broke sharply to press the pace of RED BOTTOM REBEL while racing three-wide, gained command nearing the five-sixteenths
pole, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole and held sway to the wire. SHOE GAME chased the leaders from the inside, steadied nearing
the seven-sixteenths pole, angled out approaching the stretch and finished willingly. WAY TO FIRE settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn, reached a striking distance nearing the half but failed to gain in the drive. CAMEO SHORES lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and finished evenly. SHELBY R. raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, checked nearing the half, angled in with a furlong to run
and was not a factor. IZANAMI was forwardly placed from the inside and weakened after going a half. MOONSHINE MOXY raced off the leaders early,
moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not menace. SHEZ A GRINDER lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the
turn and did not offer a bid. CHICKS DIG MUNNY was off slow, lagged early, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. RED BOTTOM REBEL
set a pressured pace from the inside, went wrong and was pulled up nearing the seven-sixteenths marker and vanned off. FRACTIONAL TIMES ADDED

RACE HOME settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and
drew off. COASTAL KID was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, offered a bid into the lane, gained a brief lead, could not
match strides with the winner but finished well to hold the place. COBRA JET chased the leaders from the inside, moved up to take a brief lead nearing the
quarter and gave way in the drive. JAZZ HANDS sprinted clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way through the final furlong.
LINCHPIN STORM was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. YOU SPLIT TENS was off slow, lacked early
foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. JUSPASSINTHRU chased the leaders from the inside for a half and weakened.
