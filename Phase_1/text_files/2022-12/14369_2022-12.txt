STORMY EMPIRE prompted the early pace outside of SHEZA SAVAGE while racing keenly, took the lead outside that foe at the seven sixteenths, opened
up while saving ground around the rest of the turn, and drew off in the two to three path in the lane under a hand ride. WILDWOOD POSSE tracked the
leading pair down the back straight, continued to chase well behind them in the three path on the turn, swung out into the lane in the three to four path,
chased on under a drive while drifting out midstretch, proved no match for the winner but did wrest the place late. SHEZA SAVAGE was sent for speed, set
the early pace inside of STORMY EMPIRE, was headed by that foe near the seven sixteenths and could not keep pace when asked, continued to chased
on while saving ground on the turn, chased on in the two to three path while no match in the lane and lost the place late to WILDWOOD POSSE. BEG
BORROW N STEAL settled at the rear, was pushed along into the turn, remained at the rear in the four path on the turn, was driven near the five sixteenths
and also in upper stretch, offered no response and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
ASTI SKY broke inwards crossing into the path of STORM'S REFLECTION, was righted to attend the pace outside foes into the backstretch, continued well
outside foes racing in the four path to the second bend, shifted in to challenge three deep racing into the far turn, went clear while shifting well off the inside
racing into upper stretch and held sway on a safe margin to the end under energetic handling. C F V RED NOVA settled off the leaders while angling to the
inside racing to the backstretch, advanced splitting foes racing into the far turn, then shifted three deep midway through the bend, was urged to bid inside
the pacesetter in upper stretch but proved only second best. STORM BORN tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the opening half, was prompted to
advance while caught widest leaving the far turn and had no closing bid while continuing well enough to earn a share. BIG BLUE broke awkwardly, was
urged to terms with the pacesetter between foes prompting that rival to the backstretch and gave out racing into the far turn. STORM'S REFLECTION,
carried inwards by the eventual winner at the start, was urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage for a half and gave way abruptly.

Footnotes
OWEN'S PLEASURE was carried out in the opening strides by FIRST KITTEN breaking outward, raced in the rear flight near the center of the track down
the back straight while racing a bit keenly, was pushed along in the four path near the three eighths and loomed outside the tracking flight approaching the
quarter, floated out near the center of the track in upper stretch, chased on, found her best near the sixteenth and drove to the lead in the final strides. GO
STORMIN GIRL was reluctant to load, sent clear inside of FIRST KITTEN, set the pace in the two path on the turn, shook off FIRST KITTEN and OWEN'S
PLEASURE for the time being as she raced into the lane, kept on in the two to three path under a drive but was nailed in the last strides. FIRST KITTEN
broke outward but sharply, tracked the leader down the backstretch and in the three path on the turn, floated into the lane in the five to six path, chased on
with interest but lacked the needed kick to match the top two late. MARYS LAST SONG was reluctant to load when asked to enter the stalls for the first
time, acted fractious in the gate when the field reloaded after a gate scratch, settled at the inside of the rear flight, chased at the rear in the two path on the
turn, was urged in the three path in upper stretch and driven near the three sixteenths, chased to the furlong mark, stopped just past that pole, was pulling
up as he crossed the wire and was vanned off after the race.

Footnotes
SNOWMOBILE broke sharply, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage, repelled a rival's challenge nearing the bend to go clear
leaving the midway point of the turn, shifted off the inside racing through the stretch but maintained a comfortable advantage under firm encouragement.
LAST WISH, bumped at the start, angled quickly to the inside to track just off the leaders racing to the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and continued
with interest to edge a rival for the place honors in the closing stages. STAR NATION settled well off the field in the opening quarter while angling to the rail,
saved ground to upper stretch, then tipped a bit off the inside while continuing with interest to gain position and earn a share. SLAVA UKRAINI was urged
five wide through the backstretch into the turn pursuing the pacesetter, shifted inwards bumping SHARP AZ NAILS midway through the bend, continued
widest into the stretch and lacked the needed final kick. SHARP AZ NAILS was urged pursuing the pacesetter four wide between foes through the
backstretch into the turn, was bumped while caught momentarily in tight quarters midway through the bend, shifted inwards racing through the stretch but
had no late response. SWISS GUARD stumbled at the start, then bumped LAST WISH while regaining his footing, was urged pressing the pacesetter into
the turn and gave way nearing midstretch when failing to match that rival. RUN THE TABLE switched out pursuing the leaders three wide between foes into
the turn and gave way nearing upper stretch. SOVIET STANDARD settled into stride off the inside dropping well off the leaders and never proved a serious
threat.

Footnotes
TAP N TWINE was sent to the lead between horses, opened up in the two path on the turn, floated into the lane in the four path, began to draw off, was
driven briefly in midstretch and continued to increase her advantage to the finish. MORNING LINE NEWS raced at the rear of the main group early, chased
in the three path well behind the tracking line, began to take closer order on them from near the three eighths, tipped out near the five sixteenths to engage
outside the tracking flight, swung out near the center of the course in upper stretch, and chased on willingly to prove a clear second best. HEY MA tracked
the leader inside foes down the back straight and while pushed along on the rail around the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, could not reel in TAP N
TWINE, chased on but proved no match for MORNING LINE NEWS for place in the final furlong. SHINY SHOES tracked the leading pair outside of
BOOZIN AT BOZOS early, tracked three wide on the turn, swung five wide into upper stretch, drifted in a bit midstretch and out again late while flattening.
AIR WALKER broke a bit awkwardly and came into stride slowly as a result, trailed early, was pushed along in the five to six path on the turn and took closer
order, was taken out near the center of the track into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. FROST WARRIOR was urged between horses in the opening
sixteenth of a mile for position but then took back, drifted to the rear of the main group approaching the half, raced in the two path on the turn, was relegated
to the rear past the three eighths, was herded in a bit in upper stretch when BOOZIN AT BOZOS drifted in, and had no rally. BOOZIN AT BOZOS tracked
the leading pair inside of SHINY SHOES early, continued to track between horses around the turn, drifted inward on FROST WARRIOR in upper stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
NYOMAN, off a bit slowly, tracked the leaders along the rail to the turn while being prompted to gain position nearing the bend, shifted out three wide racing
into upper stretch and responded with a steady, late effort to prevail narrowly in time under firm left handed encouragement. SHANGHAI POINT broke
readily, was urged along the inside disputing the pace inside a rival racing into the bed, continued to contest the issue in a prolonged drive, resisting to late
stages but couldn't fend off the winner. FLEETWAY was urged from the break to press the pace outside the pacesetter into the turn, dueled between foes
leaving midstretch but was outkicked by the top pair. EASTER MUSIC tracked off the first flight outside foes through the backstretch, was fanned four wide
nearing upper stretch, then five deep in the last furlong but lacked the needed final kick. EMOJI GUY came under pressure soon after the break while
lacking an early response, gathered momentum racing into the turn, shifted out entering the lane and made some belated progress four wide between foes
in the last furlong. SIR ACEALOT flashed brief pace three wide between foes and retreated early.

Footnotes
BERAVINA vied inside of SHE'S WANDAFUL around the first turn, set the pace while pressured by that foe down the back straight, vied in the two path
inside of that foe and WILDWOOD BYE around the far turn, was engaged by QUILTING PARTY to her inside into the lane, disputed the pace between
horses through midstretch, briefly surrendered a short lead to QUILTING PARTY near the sixteenth, but gamely fought back to get up at the wire.
QUILTING PARTY was anxious in the gate, settled near the rear, began to take closer order past the five eighths, rallied in earnest while saving ground
around the far turn, hugged the rail into the lane and engaged inside of BERAVINA, battled at the inside of the leading flight through midstretch, wrested a
narrow lead near the sixteenth mark but could not hold off BERAVINA's rerally in the final strides. WILDWOOD BYE attended the pace three wide while
keen around the first turn, tracked the leading pair down the back straight, bid three wide into the far turn, vied around the bend and four wide into the lane,
continued to dispute the pace past the furlong marker, but flattened out from near the sixteenth. COME ON SWEET PEA settled at the rear, trailed down the
back straight, rallied in the three to four path on the far turn, drifted out in upper stretch, and drove past tiring horses. QUEEN CHARMAINE chased midfield
around the first turn, was a bit keen to join inside of WANDA STRONG down the back straight, chased two wide around the far turn, was driven in upper
stretch and flattened out. SHE'S WANDAFUL vied two wide around the first turn, pressed the pace outside of BERAVINA down the back straight, vied
between horses around the far turn, could not match the leaders from upper stretch and weakened. WANDA STRONG tracked behind the leading line
around the first turn, raced keenly outside of QUEEN CHARMAINE down the backstretch while chasing the leading line, emptied out in the four to five path
around the far turn and had no more in the lane.

Footnotes
Z U SOON broke sharply, conceded the lead to stalk just outside the pacesetter racing to the turn, readily advanced on that foe nearing upper stretch, raced
in the four path bidding for command three wide in upper stretch, wrested a clear advantage while shifting to the inside and went well clear under mild
encouragement. D'ARCHER, off a bit slowly, was prompted to gain contention inside foes in the opening stages, came around a tiring foe racing into the
bend, advanced along the rail into upper stretch and proved best of the others in the drive. BORN AGAIN GEORGE broke readily, was urged to a clear
advantage just off the inside racing into the turn, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being roused to resist the winner's challenge but emptied out
leaving the furlong marker. FORT RIDGE tracked the leaders behind the second flight racing three wide between foes into the turn, shifted inwards nearing
upper stretch and continued evenly into the lane. TALE OF THE NILE, unhurried four wide in early stages racing behind the second flight, was fanned five
wide racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed late bid. PINSON was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch but
emptied out early. FIXICO broke slowly, switched outside foes to race five wide into the turn and emptied out into upper stretch. BEL BIMBO trailed
throughout.
