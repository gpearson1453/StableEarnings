COALINGA HILLS dueled for the lead from inside, cleared rival at the three-eighths pole and held well under a drive to the wire. YOUR ROYAL COIL broke
in, bumped, dueled for command from outside, chased the leader past the three-eights pole in the two path, stayed on well through the lane but had to settle
for second best. TRUTH PREVAILS got knocked into inner rival leaving the gate, tracked two wide then along the rail, kept on through the late stages but
could not threaten the top pair. HOT ON THE TRAIL got bumped from outside and crowded between rivals in the beginning, trailed on the inside then two
wide into the stretch and failed to menace. GLITTER LAKE raced up close four deep leaving the backstretch, got bumped and floated out to the five path by
WARREN'S QUEEN BEE early on the turn, moved back in a bit and chased four wide into the drive and lacked a late bid. WARREN'S MEMORABLE broke
a bit slow, got crowded a bid between rivals at the three-eighths pole, entered the lane three wide and could not rally. WARREN'S QUEEN BEE pressed the
pace three deep exiting the backstretch, lugged out and bumped GLITTER LAKE early on the turn, spun four wide into the lane and weakened.

Footnotes
CAJUN TREASURE sped to the front, was overtaken into the turn but fought back inside a pair of rivals while in the two path, had the rider lose his whip
past the quarter pole, regained command and dueled with PERFECTO AMOR down the lane, held a short advantage in the furlong grounds and inched
away late. JUNE GLOOM chased on the inside into and around the bend, stayed within range through the stretch run then put in a mild late bid and got up
for second along the fence. EL DIABLO ROJO threw his head and came away slow, moved into range three deep, spun four wide into the lane, finished
determinedly but got edged for the place. OIL CAN KNIGHT broke a step slow, stalked from outside early then engaged the leaders three deep into the turn,
vied four wide while taking a narrow lead at the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, fought back alongside CAJUN TREASURE
through the lane and faltered late. PERFECTO AMOR chased early then took over into the turn, vied three wide while between rivals around the bend, lost
command at the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened in the lane. MAKAH LANE was a bit rank chasing behind the leader early, rounded the bend two wide
and weakened. RECKONING DAY tossed his head and came away very slow, went four deep into the turn, five wide into the stretch and failed to menace.

Footnotes
THALES dueled for command from inside, two wide into the stretch, disposed of WARRIOR ROAD in midstretch, turned away SENSE OF DOMINANCE
outside the sixteenth pole and held gamely over the late run from DISTORTED MATH in the closing moments. DISTORTED MATH stalked the leaders up
the backstretch while a bit keen, saved ground through the turn, put in a late bid from the fence but ran out of time. SENSE OF DOMINANCE stalked the
leading pair outside a rival, rounded the bend three then four wide, bid outside THALES in the lane but failed to find the needed late kick in the final
sixteenth. CUPID'S CRUSADER was off a bit slow in the beginning, tracked two wide around the turn, moved to the rail in the lane and earned a minor
award. HASKELLED chased three wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide and failed to respond when called upon. WARRIOR ROAD dueled outside
THALES into and around the turn, fought three wide into the lane, lost touch with that rival in midstretch and weakened in the late stages.

LASTING LOVE broke a step slow, went up to stalk behind the leader, waited for room on the turn, gained an opening leaving the bend, quickly challenged
at the top of the stretch and took over past the quarter pole and drew off under mild hand urging. VIOLET STORM broke out and bumped, settled on the
inside, moved to the two path around the bend, steered out into the lane and rallied for second. NEAREST N DEAREST was closest in pursuit from outside
early, bid between on the turn and three wide into the stretch, could not kick on with the winner with three-sixteenths remaining and got outkicked for the
place. CAT BANDIT chased off the rail early, bid three deep on the turn, four wide into the stretch and flattened to fourth. VILLA NOVA bumped leaving the
gate, trailed four wide into the turn, moved down to the two path, steered to the fence in the drive and kept trying late. JUSTIN'S LADY sped clear and
crossed over, vied on the inside and two wide into the stretch, lost the lead past the quarter pole and faded in the final furlong. BIG NEWTON got
sandwiched at the start, went three then four wide around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
FOUNDER'S DAY bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter from outside, engaged that rival on the far turn, cleared in upper stretch and held well
under right and left handed urging to the wire. SHARED FUTURE got pinballed in the beginning, traveled two wide outside a rival on the clubhouse turn,
pushed on three wide through the second bend, moved out in the lane and finished determinedly to whittle the gap on the winner and gain the place.
WHISTLER'S STYLE was off a bit slow to begin, tucked inside while trailing into the first turn, moved closer and followed behind the leader into the far turn,
continued to save ground around the second bend, kept on through the lane but lacked the needed late punch to threaten the top pair. ACT OF
SERENDIPITY was along the rail through the clubhouse turn, moved out and tracked three then two wide on the second bend and passed rivals to earn a
minor award. STARSHIP DEFIANT broke out and bumped SHARED FUTURE, sped clear and crossed to the inside, showed the way up the backstretch,
engaged by FOUNDER'S DAY on the far turn, maintained a short lead to the quarter pole, then gave up command and weakened in the late stages. AQUA
JULIA broke a step slow, chased four wide into the first turn then moved into the three path, steered into the two path then angled to the rail on the far turn
and could not rally in the drive.

MIGHTY MATT raced at the back outside rivals into the turn, moved out and came five wide into the stretch, closed in on the top pair from outside and
swept by in the final sixteenth. CATBERNAY was closest in pursuit three wide to the stretch, drew alongside the leader with a sixteenth to go but was no
match for MIGHTY MATT late. SWAMP'N AIN'T EZ lunged as the gate opened and to come away to a fast start, set the pace two wide through the turn, led
clear into the final furlong, challenged by a pair of rivals at the sixteenth and yielded. SAYERS raced in mid-pack early, drifted four wide around the turn and
kept on to earn a minor award. STREET BEHAVIOR raced outside a rival at the back into the turn, rounded the bend two wide, tipped out past the eighth
pole and failed to threaten. HARPER'S GEM chased off the rail, four wide into the stretch and weakened. COUNT TOLSTOY dropped back early on the
inside and was never a factor. RAWHIDE RAWLINS chased along the rail on the turn, eased out entering the stretch and tired.

TAKE A LEAP trailed the field early, took the turn two then three wide, rallied and moved inward past the eighth pole, surged late and overhauled
TALKATIVE GAL and A NEW PEACE in the final sixteenth. TALKATIVE GAL stalked the pacesetter early then bid between foes and vied for command
around the turn and into the stretch, reached the front and held a narrow advantage entering the final furlong, showed the way into the final sixteenth but
was overtaken by the winner late. A NEW PEACE chased outside a rival, went three wide into the turn, drifted five wide into the stretch and gained the
show. SOUL SWEET was forwardly placed in the early going, bid three deep on the turn, fought outside rivals then faltered in the final furlong. FLAT OUT
JOY got bumped and crowded between rivals at the start, moved into stalking position behind the leaders, rounded the bend two then three wide, steered
out in the lane and took aim but could not find the needed late kick. SMILIN EVIE bumped leaving the gate, saved ground around the bend and failed to
threaten. RAIN DIVA sped clear and steered to the inside, vied inside a pair of rivals into and around the turn, relinquished the lead but fought to midstretch,
then tired late.

Footnotes
JOE DON LOONEY stalked the duo up the backstretch, bid three deep at the five-sixteenths pole, fought four wide into the lane, cleared past the
three-sixteenths pole and held well in the final sixteenth. ALPINE THUNDER tracked five wide through the turn, chased between rivals into the final furlong
and got up for the place. PRODIGAL SON brushed in the beginning, raced in range two wide into the turn, traveled three to four wide into the stretch, got
hemmed in by ALPINE THUNDER and angled inward in the final furlong and finished willingly but got edged for the show. WINDRIBBON brushed leaving
the gate, chased five then six wide around the turn, finished with a mild late bid but lacked the needed late punch. DISKO TRIBUTE settled off the pace,
traveled between runners then six wide into the turn, angled in and tucked inside around the bend, kept on through the lane but needed to find more late.
SAWASDEE brushed at the start, dueled for the lead from inside, vied inside a pair of rivals on the turn and two wide into the stretch, relinquished the lead
and weakened down the lane. LARRY'S LEGEND chased widest up the backstretch, went seven wide into the turn, angled into the four path around the
bend, came in and found the rail in the stretch and never made an impact. HEAD FOR BUSINESS brushed at the start, dueled for command from outside,
vied between rivals leaving the turn and folded in the stretch.

GIVER NOT A TAKER stalked the pace on the inside, dueled briefly leaving the clubhouse turn when the leader ducked out and lost his rider, took back to
stalk the speed gain, saved ground through the far turn, rallied up the fence in the final sixteenth and overtook CYPRO RIDE in the closing moments.
CRYPTO RIDE tracked three deep into the first turn then was forced to steady leaving the first turn, continued in range of the top pair to the far turn, bid
three deep exiting the bend, took over and cleared in upper stretch, led into the final sixteenth and got caught near the wire. GEEZER bobbled leaving the
gate, pulled and became rank early, inherited the lead leaving the first turn, dueled inside TOM AND JAZZY to the far turn, vied inside a pair of rivals into the
stretch, lost command at the top of the lane, could not match strides with the leaders through the stretch but churned on for a clear third. MERIT SONG
bumped leaving the gate, chased four deep then steadied leaving the clubhouse turn, spun three wide into the lane and flattened. AMIGO G A bumped with
MERIT SONG at the start, reserved early on at the back and steered to the inside, moved out and came three to four wide into the stretch and failed to rally.
TOM AND JAZZY broke out, pulled four to three wide early then steadied leaving the clubhouse turn, went up to challenge from outside up the backstretch,
vied between into the lane and gave way. BELLY UP forwardly placed three wide early then got forced out by PLEASE FOCUS and checked hard leaving
the clubhouse turn, chased four to five wide on the far turn and weakened. PLEASE FOCUS sped to the front and moved into the two path, ducked out and
lost the rider leaving the first turn, was eventually corralled and walked off. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE INCIDENT ON THE
CLUBHOUSE TURN AND RULED THAT SINCE PLEASE FOCUS FINISHED LAST THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.
