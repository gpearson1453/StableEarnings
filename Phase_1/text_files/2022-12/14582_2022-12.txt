Footnotes
MY MAN FLINT was bumped at the start, trailed inside early, circled five wide around the far turn, fanned seven wide into the lane, kicked in, seized
command near the sixteenth pole, battled outside of a pair through the final sixteenth and prevailed. GRAPE NUTS WARRIOR settled off the early pace two
wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied between foes in the lane, reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole, battled between to the wire
and won the place photo. BOURBON THUNDER pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, was
collared near the sixteenth pole but fought on gamely inside of the top two. JACK THE CAT saved ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn,
swung eight wide in upper stretch and rallied widest. NO MAN LEFT BEHIND was hard to handle inside, checked repeatedly around the first turn, raced in
range inside, checked again midway around the far turn, dropped back two wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and had some stretch gain.
TELEPHONE TALKER failed to menace while racing two and three wide. BACKWOODS BOOGIE tracked the pace two wide and faded through the lane.
HEY PORTER steadied early, raced well back two wide, made a strong three wide middle move and had little left for the stretch. ASTROTURF raced off the
pace inside, swung eight wide in upper stretch and never threatened. CUPID'S DUDE chased the pace two and three wide and weakened in the lane.
WALK UP MUSIC set the pace along the rail, was collared near the three-eighths pole, resisted inside to upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
SHESTERKIN set the pace in the two path, was roused from the three path when challenged by an inside bid from CASE turning into the stretch, bumped
with said rival in upper stretch, dug in to repel that challenge passing the eighth pole, and was driven clear. CASE had an awkward start and was bumped
between foes out of the gate, stalked along the inside, was cued to bid for the lead through an opening along the rail turning into the stretch, bumped with
SHESTERKIN from the two path in upper stretch, but was repelled by said rival in the final furlong to finish with place honors. KENTUCKY JOKER broke in
and bumped CASE at the start, was prompted in the four path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and evened out in the stretch for show.
BOURBON RESOLVE bumped with CENTRIST ROAD in the opening furlong, tracked in the five path, took aim from said position going into the stretch, but
flattened. POWERTRAIN chased along the inside early, angled out under coaxing around the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but was no
factor. CHECKITUP trailed from the two path going into the turn and was no threat. GOODLOOKINRAGS broke out and bumped CASE at the start, pressed
the pace in the three path but yielded passing the quarter pole. CENTRIST ROAD bumped with BOURBON RESOLVE in the opening furlong, was hustled
from the four path into the turn, eased and pulled up entering the stretch, and walked off.

Footnotes
CLASSIC LADY prompted the pace in the three path, was cued to bid from the four path going into the stretch, took the lead in upper stretch, and held on
gamely. SPECTACULAR GAL stalked in the two path, angled out around the far turn and was driven from the six path into the stretch, and ran on for place.
LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN raced in midpack from the three path, was roused from the five path into the stretch, and kept on while shifting inwards late for show.
PASSION PLUS tracked in the five path, shifted out to the seven path turning into the lane, and stayed on down the center. GREY CHARLOTTE set the
pace from the two path, dug in from said position turning into the stretch, but yielded going into the final furlong. TIZ IMPRESSIVE was unhurried from the
five path, swung out to the nine path going into the stretch, and mildly gained. SHE FLED THE SCENE trailed from the four path into the stretch and never
factored. GOLDEN VOICE raced prominently between rivals early, was under urging from the five path entering the stretch, but flattened. BASILIA raced
from up close in the four path but faded going into the stretch. VANDALIA rated in the four path but was no menace. NANA FANNY was always behind
around the two path.

EXPECT MORE hesitated at the start, raced off the pace three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, bid two wide into the far turn, took the lead
near the five-sixteenths pole, ducked out into the path of JUNGFRAU under left-handed urging in upper stretch, straightened out under right-handed
pressure soon after, battled inside of JUNGFRAU to the wire and just lasted. JUNGFRAU stalked the pace three wide around the first turn and two wide
down the backstretch, was pushed in entering the far turn, was boxed in around much of that bend, angled three wide near the quarter pole, was forced out
in upper stretch, battled on gamely outside, reached even terms in deep stretch and lost the head bob. SOUTHERN DREAM was up close inside early,
steadied late on the first turn, angled out nearing the far turn, made progress three and four wide around the turn but could not keep pace with the top two in
the lane. GAME CHANGE raced in range two wide but lacked a rally. DREAM KNIGHT set the pace along the rail and tired in the lane. COLLIER'S TIME hit
the starting gate, raced two wide and never threatened. SMILE MON had his head turned at the start and trailed inside. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF JUNGFRAU, EXPECT MORE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM FIRST AND PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN
UPPER STRETCH.

MARYQUITECONTRARY bumped into INDICIA out of the gate, rated from the six path into the turn, was cued to loom up five wide around the turn, bid
from the six path entering the lane, and was driven clear. COLORFUL MISCHIEF chased in the five path, shifted inside going into the turn, had to steady
and was stymied by a retreating ZAINALARAB nearing the quarter pole, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for
place. ALLWORTHY tracked in the three path, was ridden from the four path going into the stretch, but evened out for show. MUSIC CITY STAR stumbled
at the start, recovered to stalk from the four path early, but flattened in the stretch. ZAINALARAB bumped into INDICIA at the start, set the pace from the
two path but gaveway along the inside turning into the lane. SOUL OF AN ANGEL was wellback in the three path and never menaced. INDICIA got steadied
and bumped on both sides out of the gate and was always behind.

Footnotes
STOLEN HOLIDAY raced up close early, was bumped hard and checked entering the first turn, raced off the pace two and three wide from there, swung
seven wide in upper stretch, closed strongly, took over near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead. LADY ROCKSTAR (GB) settled off the early pace while
racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, bid between foes nearing the sixteenth pole but was outkicked by the winner. BAY STORM set
the pace in the two path, shook clear in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and held well enough to preserve the show. PHANTOM VISION stalked the
pace three and four wide and weakened in the lane. KEEPER OF TIME (IRE) failed to menace while racing two wide. SCOTISH STAR (ARG) had early
speed inside, angled out midway around the first turn, stalked in the three path down the backstretch and around the far turn then faded through the stretch.
DIAMOND WOW was up close inside, hit the rail and bumped hard nearing the first turn, chased inside, tipped out in the stretch and lacked a closing bid.
KAHIKO was bumped hard between foes entering the first turn, raced two wide and never threatened. SECRET TIME (GER) trailed inside.

Footnotes
SIBELIUS raced prominently along the inside early, angled out going into the turn to bid from two wide around the turn, took the lead entering the stretch
and was driven clear. DEAN DELIVERS stalked in the two path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for place.
STEAL SUNSHINE broke out at the start, rated in the two path, was angled out to the eight path going into the stretch, and rallied down the center for show.
UNCLE ERNIE set the pace from the two path was roused from the rail into the stretch, but yielded before the eighth pole. COUNTY FINAL prompted the
pace from the three path, was coaxed around the turn, but flattened from the five path in the stretch. SURLY FURIOUS trailed from the four path into the
turn, swung out to the nine path going into the stretch but was no factor. PREVALENCE was hustled along from inside, dropped back going into the turn,
and was no threat. SEAL BEACH tracked in the four path, was in the five path entering the stretch but never threatened. NO QUE NO raced in midpack
from the four path, shifted inside going into the turn, but was tired in the stretch. SPEAKING chased from the five path early but was empty going into the
stretch. WIND OF CHANGE (BRZ) had a slow start and never menaced racing around the six path.

CITY MAN bumped with KENTUCKY GHOST soon after the start, quickly angled to the rail, raced in range inside, advanced inside around the far turn,
tipped two wide in search of a clear path midway around the turn, steadied near the quarter pole, dove back to the rail in upper stretch, made a quick bid
inside of the pacesetter to seize command leaving the eighth pole, burst clear soon after, switched back to the left lead near the sixteenth pole and held safe
under a drive. DECORATED INVADER stalked the pace in the clear two wide, edged closer two wide around the turn, reached near even terms in
midstretch, could not match strides with the winner from there but fought on to hold the place. STREET READY was hustled from the gate, steadied not long
after as the winner angled in in front of him, saved ground in midpack, advanced two wide around the far turn, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied
between foes. WINFROMWITHIN set the pace along the rail, drifted out a bit turning for home, led to midstretch and kept trying between foes to save a
share. GOOD GOVERNANCE (GB) lightly bumped with KING CAUSE soon after the start, saved ground well back, swung widest in upper stretch and
finished well. COLONEL LIAM raced in range three wide for seven furlongs, had aim four wide in upper stretch and flattened out. PAO ALTO (FR) saved
ground and failed to menace. TANGO TANGO TANGO hit the starting gate then was squeezed back soon after the start, raced off the pace two wide and
never threatened. KING CAUSE was lightly bumped soon after the start, raced two wide and made little impact. SHADOW SPHINX raced two and three
wide in midpack and lacked a closing bid. KENTUCKY GHOST was bumped soon after the start, raced off the pace two wide around the first turn, went five
wide around the far turn and had no bids. CARPENTERS CALL played no factor while racing four wide.

SKIPPYLONGSTOCKING raced prominently from the three path, bid from said position around the far turn, led going into the stretch, and drew clear.
PIONEER OF MEDINA set the pace in the two path, lost the lead around the far turn and was under urging from the three path going into the stretch, dug in
when challenged by SIMPLIFICATION for minor rewards at the top of the lane, and repelled said foe to hold place. SIMPLIFICATION stalked in the four
path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and kept on but hung late for show. O'CONNOR (CHI) rated along the inside around the first turn, shifted
out to the five path down the backstretch, floated out to the eight path entering the lane, but was one paced down the center. SOUTH BEND trailed from the
two path into the far turn, tipped out under rousing to the six path and bumped STRIKE HARD entering the lane, and flattened. STRIKE HARD raced off the
pace in the three path, was bumped by SOUTH BEND out to the seven path while under a drive entering the stretch, and was tired. COOKE CREEK
tracked in the two path but faded along the inside turning into the lane. CLAPTON chased in the four path but was empty going into the stretch.
