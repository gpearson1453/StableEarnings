FORGOTTEN FORTUNE tracked the leader from the two path down the backstretch then coaxed her at the quarter pole and drew away. VODKA SUNRISE
was rushed up to a clear lead, was headed at the quarter pole but was no match for the winner. SUNNY AND CLEAR chased the leaders and passed tiring
rival. BROADWAY PEARL bumped by CLASSY NANA at the start then hustled up the rail to be forwardly place angled out to three wide at the three
sixteenths pole and weakened. COZZOLANI had no early speed but made a late try to improve her position in the stretch. MALLORI'S MAGIC settled near
the back down the backstretch then made a three wide bid on the turn and faltered. CLASSY NANA was bumped by SHE IS MAKING RIP at the start, raced
in the middle of the pack off the rail but was not a factor. SHE IS MAKING RIP broke in and bumped CLASSY NANA at the start, was void of speed and not
a threat.

Footnotes
GENIUS had no early speed then circled the field on the turn, went four wide in upper stretch and closed willingly to be up for the win. JACKIE MOON was
close up on the inside, took a brief late lead in the final yards but was nailed at the wire. AHIMAAZ was rushed up the challenge the leader early then made
a late run in the stretch and missed. LOOKIN FOR LARRY sprinted to a clear lead and was caught in the final yards. SPRY CHARLIE tracked the leaders
from the two path moved out the three wide in upper stretch but lacked a late response. MOONSHINE MAX stalked the pace from the three path but failed
to menace. CLASSIC RED RACER was always back.

PAISLEY CROSS was hustled to a clear lead and held on. PUZZLING PRIORITY raced in the middle of the pack to the turn then made a four wide bid at
the quarter pole to make a late gain on the winner but was not enough. TIDDLY was close up on the inside then dropped back on the turn, made a rebid up
the rail in the stretch and finished gamely. SUMMERJUSTBET HER passed tiring rivals. SHADES OF TRUTH was forwardly placed to the turn then made a
three wide bid at the quarter pole and faltered. LUCKY EVERY DAY pressed the pace from the two path and gave way. STARBUCK LUCK has an awkward
start and remained back. HURRICANE TIZWAY had no speed and was not a threat.

Footnotes
HIGHLAND CREEK tracked the leaders from the two path around the first turn then moved up to vie for the lead on the backstretch, engaged the leader at
the five sixteenths pole and took command at the three sixteenths pole and just lasted. BALLINONABUDJET raced near the back on the inside the moved
out to two wide on the backstretch the was asked at the quarter pole, moved back in to the rail at the sixteenth pole to make a late run up the rail and just
missed. VENN stalked the pace from the three path around the first turn then moved up on the backstretch, made a three wide bid at the quarter pole and
fought gamely in the early stretch to be best of the rest. GUITAR SLIM raced in the middle of the pack on the inside but failed to menace. DOCTOR LEO
went to the early lead from the inside around the first turn then was headed at the five sixteenths pole and gave way at the three sixteenths pole. WISE
VERDICT was allowed to settle in the two path but was never a factor. BINDING was unhurried into the first turn and remained back.
