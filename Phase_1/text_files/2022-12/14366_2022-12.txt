Footnotes
HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY set the pace in the two path, then drew off through the lane under light urging. ENTITLEMENT settled off of the pace along the
inside, gained outside of the top pair in the four path around the turn, bid for place entering the lane as the leader shook away, then ran on to prove second
best. PRAY FOR US tracked along the inside, gained place entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position in upper stretch. DAT
GUITAR rated at the rear in the three path, tucked while trailing turning for home, and improved inside of tiring foes in upper stretch. SHES A LUCKY
REBEL veered out at the start, stalked three wide, chased the leader from the three path around the turn, and weakened between horses in upper stretch.
BAYOU BEAUTY pressed two wide and between horses, but yielded at the three furlong pole, then steadied among rivals turning for home while continuing
to weaken.

UNITEDAPPEAL set the pace along the inside as his outer stablemates pressed on, sparred with only ALABAMA QUEEN around the turn, and gamely
clung to a margin from that foe through the lane. ALABAMA QUEEN pressed three wide, dueled for the lead outside of the eventual winner around the turn,
battled through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, but failed to keep pace in the final sixteenth. PURE PAM DEMONIUM lacked speed despite heavy
urging from the rider, inched closer in the four path around the turn to gain show leaving the five sixteenths pole, then ran on while pursuing the top pair
through the lane. SHE IS MAKING RIP prompted the pace two wide while between horses contending stable-mates, but weakened at the three furlong pole,
and failed to change leads until approaching the final sixteenth. ZADAR was outrun.

FIRED UP TIGER set the pace, sparred with an outer bidder around the far turn, tenaciously repelled that rival coming to the final furlong, and drove clear.
FOOLISH STEVE pressed two wide, vied around the far turn, but was turned away nearing midstretch, and remained well clear of show. KELLYS THE
BOSS saved ground off of the pace, gained show from an outer rival entering the lane, and fended off an inner foe for that position through the late stages.
BOBBY JR. raced in midpack two wide, shifted inwardly in upper stretch, vied for show with an outer rival in the closing stages, but missed. TWO MIKES N
DOC G lacked speed three wide, and faded. LIKEN IT stalked along the inside, chased the embattled leading pair around the far turn, but weakened while
lugging out entering the lane. BAMA DRIFTER lagged behind while kept wide, and showed little while eased through the lane.

Footnotes
VARSITY FLYGIRL stalked outside of the pace setter, assumed command from that one entering the far turn, tucked to the two path around that bend, then
drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure. CARSON'S PRINCESS cleared off in the three path around the first turn, but was headed by the eventual
winner entering the far turn, failed to keep pace turning for home, yet managed place through the lane. QUINN MURPHY trailed in the four path, then stayed
on to reach show at the wire. PAYTONSATTHEPLATE tracked along the inside, ranged up outside of the top pair and in the four path turning for home to
bid for place entering the lane, but flattened out in upper stretch, weakened, and got nailed at the wire for show. GLANCE laid off of the pace in the three to
four paths, and faded.

Footnotes
BRIGHT SPARK trailed along the inside, improved to a stalking position approaching the far turn, smoothly slipped through a wide rail seam with five
sixteenths to go to bid entering the lane, then drove clear in upper stretch, and held sway safely from a pursuing foe. BARTULIA stalked while tucking to the
inside around the first turn, shifted to the five path to be outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole, but was outmoved by an rail skimming foe while
being floated to the seven path entering the lane, and ran on well thereafter. PRINCE OF GLORY tracked in the five path, yielded between horses
approaching the five sixteenths pole, tucked two wide nearing the lane, yet sustained stride to gain show from wider foes at the furlong grounds, and lasted
for that position. MAASAI WARRIOR laid off of the pace in the four to six paths around the turns, shifted out in upper stretch, and stayed on through the final
furlong to miss reaching show. GUARANTEED SPECK set the pace inside of a pressing foe while in the three path around the first turn, tucked to the rail
down the backstretch, shfited back off of it entering the far turn, clung to an advantage from outer foes while requiring strong rider correction to keep from
lugging out around the far turn, then was headed by a rail bidder nearing the lane, and yielded in the five path while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch.
ICE AXE saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. JEEPER pressed outside of the leader and from the four path, vied around the far turn, but was
outkicked by an inner rival while getting floated to the six path between horses nearing the lane, and weakened.

Footnotes
BUDRO TALKING settled far back in the three path, moved forward to track entering the far turn, gained in the four path turning for home, circled the
leading trio in upper stretch, and drove clear approaching the final furlong. BIND FAITH saved ground in midpack, tipped two wide in upper stretch, split foes
to gain place at the furlong grounds, and was second best. PACIFICISLANDTIME took a bump from an outer rival at the start, rated at the rear along the
inside, gained between horses turning for home, shifted out in upper stretch, and stayed on to claim show entering the final sixteenth. EVERLOVINGHAND
laid close up inside of the pace setter early on, backed off to stalk outside of that foe entering the backstretch, sparred with her around the far turn, led
briefly turning for home, but was swiftly outkicked in upper stretch, and faltered between horses in the final furlong. MR. FOUR SEVENS tracked the top pair
from the two to three paths, but was outkicked by an outer rival nearing the lane, and tired. AND FIFTY set the pace two wide early on before clearing
approaching the backstretch, showed the way from an outer presser into the far turn, but was headed at the quarter pole, and faded through the lane.
TREYS MIDNITE MOON lugged in, bumped a rival, and checked at the start, raced at the rear in the three path, and never got involved. CHEROKEE
TAKEOVER reared irrelevantly in the starting gates, then came out a beat slow, raced far back along the inside, and was outrun.

Footnotes
HAYUNEVANO set the pace along the inside, showed the way from an outer presser around the far turn, shook free entering the lane, and drew off under
driving pressure. CERCHI pressed the leader from the outside around both turns, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, and was second best. CUSHEE
laid off of the pace in the two to three paths, shifted to the five path entering the lane, but awkwardly changed leads at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed
on to reach show at the wire. SOULTITLESREADY tracked in the three path, tucked behind the pace setters at the three furlong pole, chased while
managing show through midstretch, but was caught on the wire for that position. BEST PERFORMER raced in midpack in the four path, inched closer to
track the top pair around the far turn, but only managed to chase through the lane while lacking a bid. BEAUTIFULNAVIGATOR (IRE) trailed early on, and
never got involved. INTERNET GIRL chased along the inside while racing with a broken right iron, faded after a half mile, then weakened around the far
turn, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
DREWZANO set a clear pace, maintained a clear advantage through midstretch, and held late as an outer rival closed in. MAINTAINANCE MATT tracked
three wide, then sustained a grinding charge to narrow the clear leader's margin through the final furlong, attempted a late bid, but was kept at bay. IMPACT
PLAYER stalked two wide, but was outkicked for place by an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole, and managed show. TAPPIN FORA DANCE pursued
from midpack in the four to five paths, but hung on his left lead through the lane, and lacked a bid. UNDERDOG laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted
out in upper stretch, and cut the gap. MR. PRIORITY stalked along the inside, but gave way. OAK HILL SOLUTION was outrun. THREE RUN HOMER
lacked speed, and faded in the five path around the turn.
