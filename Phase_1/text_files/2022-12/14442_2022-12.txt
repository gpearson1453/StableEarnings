four wide and faded in the lane. AMOR SALVAJE failed to menace while racing four wide. MY INSANITY played no factor while racing two and three wide.
ROYAL JUBILEE was outrun while racing three wide. SUBTLE FAITH chased the pace inside and retreated through the lane. LIPARI was outrun inside. MY

Footnotes
ONE IDENTITY prompted the pace from the three path into the turn, was cued from the five path turning into the stretch, took the lead into the final furlong,
drifted out, and held on. DESIGNED BY KITTEN tracked the leading duo in the two path, was roused while swinging out to the seven path turning into the
lane, and ran on while being herded outwards in the final furlong to place. SEQUIN LADY had a slow start and trailed along the inside, was ridden from the
three path into the stretch, and improved from the inside of rivals to show. BABY BLUE EYES also had a slow start and chased from the four path, was
coaxed from the five path turning into the lane, but flattened. CROWDING OUT set a quick pace along the inside but gaveway from the three path at the top
of the lane. THERE WAS AN INQUIRY LOOKING AT POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE INSIDE THE FINAL FURLONG BY THE WINNER, ONE IDENTITY,
AGAINST SECOND PLACE FINISHER, DESIGNED BY KITTEN, AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE JOCKEY, BUT THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

Footnotes
RESONANCIA hit the starting gate hard enough to briefly unbalance the rider, trailed inside for a half, circled five wide around the far turn, seized command
near the quarter pole, quickly cleared, angled into the two path in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. GREY PRINCESS settled off the pace while
racing three wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, was no match for the winner but stayed on willingly to be clearly 2nd best. TWO BEER BUZZ
raced off the pace three wide, bid four wide around the far turn, could not match strides with the winner in the lane and held on for the show. LADY PETAL
chased the pace inside and lacked the needed rally. I LOVE IRELAND pressed the pace three wide and tired in the lane. MY MICROBURST set the pace in
the two path and retreated through the stretch. ROMANCE PELUSA had brief speed inside.

Footnotes
HEIRESSTRAY set the pace from the three path into the turn, tucked in to the rail around the turn, was cued to open up entering the lane, and was much
the best. BREEZY CONNECTION chased in the five path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, and was second best. SHOW ME LOVE rated in
the four path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up to get show honors. VELOCISSIMA bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked
the pace from the three path but flattened down the lane. INTERESTING GEM was bumped into by an outer foe leaving the gate, was close up but had
steady to along the inside in the opening quarter, was ridden from the five path into he stretch but never factored. SPONGER got bumped into an inner foe
by an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace from inside but faded turning into the stretch. RESTORATION was bumped by an inner rival at the start,
raced from wellback in the four path and was never a menace. MISSY TOO broke in and bumped an inner foe, and trailed throughout.

hold sway. LIGHT AND PATH tracked in the four path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, and ran on for place. ST. JOE JET prompted the pace
from the three path but flattened out in the stretch to show. SORTARIA was held up along the inside early but was tired while in the two path entering the
stretch. MY GYPSY WITCH broke in at the start and trailed throughout from the two to four paths.

racing four wide, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch, bid inside of the winner in midstretch but was
turned back and settled for the place. BREAKING THE RULES broke outwardly and bumped ARM CANDY into SCUTTLEBUZZ into MAX K. O., trailed in
the two path for five furlongs, angled four wide near the five-sixteenths marker and rallied for the show. HOT BLOODED saved ground off the pace, angled
out in the stretch and passed tiring rivals. MAX K. O. was bumped after the start, raced off the pace four wide, bid four wide around the far turn but came up
empty in the lane. SCUTTLEBUZZ was bumped on both sides at the start, rushed up five wide around the first turn, cleared early on the backstretch, set the
pace in the two path from there to the quarter pole and tired in the lane. VALUE PROPOSITION (GB) was in range two wide and lacked a closing bid.

start and never threatened while racing three and four wide.

Footnotes
HOPE IN HIM set an open pace from the three path, was cued from the two path turning into the lane, responded well and held clear. BAHAMIAN MOON
was hustled to prompt the pace from the four path early, was coaxed from the five path turning into the lane, and chased home the winner for place honors.
KASIM bumped an inner rival at the start, rated along the inside, was roused from the three path turning into the stretch, and kept on between rivals in the
final furlong to get up for show. GRAINGER COUNTY tracked in the two path, was driven from the four path into the lane, but finished evenly.
RESERVENOTATTAINED had a slow start and was bumped by an outer rival, chased in the three path, was ridden from the five path turning into the lane,
but was tired. WAR OF AGES stalked along the inside but faded in the stretch. MIGHTY TOUGH had a slow start and trailed throughout from the two path.

raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied for the place. DOUBLE COSMO GIRL saved ground off the pace, advanced two wide between foes
around the far turn and stayed on to gain the show. ROYAL BLUSH was washy pre-race, bumped with GODLEN BELIEF at the start, stalked the pace in the
two path, angled four wide midway around the far turn, loomed in upper stretch but flattened out. SINFILTRE stumbled at the start, advanced four wide
around the first turn, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, set the pace in the two path around the far turn, angled to the rail in upper stretch and
faltered. GOLDEN BELIEF was bumped at the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. DAMANDA set the pace in the two path around the
first turn, gave way near the three-eighths pole, chased inside around the far turn, steadied near the quarter pole and had no further bids.
