Footnotes
L'ENFANT DIT was well positioned in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace to the second turn, assumed command in upper stretch, was a bit green
and switched to the left lead in the late stages, kept to task and held in a drive to prevail. THE CALABRESE KID stalked the moderate early pace to the
second turn, saved ground to the top of the lane, could not match strides with L'ENFANT DIT in upper stretch and stayed on well in the final sixteenth to be
second best. PICK BYMY FRIEND was unhurried, mounted a three wide rally on the second turn, made a mild late bid in the drive and was clear for third.
TIGER'S ARROW was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the backstretch run, mounted a four wide bid on the second turn, could not sustain that run in
the drive and flattened out. DR. FLASH DANCER showed early speed and cleared the field into the first turn, set moderate fractions through the backstretch
run, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, could not hold off L'ENFANT DIT and gave way in the drive. THECHIEFHASTRICKS was allowed to settle,
was never far back in the early stages, dropped back on the far turn and lacked a late response. OMMANEY BAY stalked the moderate early pace, came
three wide into the backstretch run, stayed within aim to the quarter marker and tired in the drive.

CAUSE SHE'S A LADY broke alertly then took back to track the early pace, pressed the moderate pace to the quarter marker, lost ground to MISS BELLA
in upper stretch, re-rallied in the final sixteenth and held on over the quickly oncoming runner-up. CIELO DIAMANTE rated off of the early pace, saved
ground to the top of the lane, tipped out three wide in upper stretch, closed fast in the final sixteenth and just missed for the win, while securing second.
MISS BELLA showed early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set decent fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear nearing mid-stretch, weakened in the
final stages while on the left lead and could not hold off oncoming rivals, while holding in the end for third. MISS MAIA broke out at the start and crowded
JACRODRA'S DEVIL, chased from the rear early on, improved position two wide on the turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch, gained ground in the
final sixteenth but was outfinished while just missing for third. JACRODRA'S DEVIL was crowded by MISS MAIA leaving the start, chased the decent early
pace, lost ground three wide on the turn and lacked a late response.

ground to the to quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, could not keep pace with his stablemate in the final furlong and held on late for second. A

Footnotes
MAYCEE JO broke alertly and assumed command of the early lead, cleared the field in the first furlong and crossed over to the rail, set moderate fractions
while prompted by CROWN KITTEN, drew clear in upper stretch, felt pressure in the final sixteenth and lasted over oncoming rivals. A DIME FOR ME
settled off of the early pace, raced three wide to the quarter marker, drifted out in the drive to be in the middle of the course, closed well in the final stages
and just missed for the win, while holding for second in the final strides. TRULY FABULOUS steadied in traffic in the early stages when MAYCEE JO
crossed over to the rail, settled off of the moderate early pace, saved ground to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, finished well in the final
sixteenth and just missed for second, while clear of the rest for third. ROSE PRINCESS tracked the moderate early pace, saved ground on the turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive. DANIELA BELLA tracked the early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker and lacked a late
rally. BOUNDFORJAMAICA checked in tight quarters in the early stages while behind TRULY FABULOUS, saved ground through the turn and was not a
factor. ROLINGA steadied in tight quarters while racing behind BOUNDFORJAMAICA, raced two wide on the turn and did not threaten. CROWN KITTEN
showed early speed and was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked her stablemate through moderate fractions to the quarter marker, lost ground in
upper stretch and faded in the final stages.

Footnotes
TAMANTARI settled in the second flight in the early going, advanced two wide on the turn, came within aim of EXTINGUISHER inside of the furlong marker,
overtook that rival and drew clear in the final stages. TIZTHEHARTOFDIXIE lacked early speed, raced three wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive,
rallied while on the left lead in the drive and was up in the final strides to secure second. EXTINGUISHER showed good early speed and disputed the early
pace, assumed command along the turn, drew clear in upper stretch, was tiring in the late stages, was overtaken in deep stretch by TAMANTARI and was
just edged for second, while clear of the rest for third. FINNLEY'S KITTEN was allowed to settle, was steered three wide on the turn, mounted a four wide
rally in upper stretch and made a mild late bid. VELVET was prominent in the early stages and contested the solid early pace, lost ground on the turn and
lacked a late rally. DAREDEVIL PRINCESS had an awkward beginning and was a bit erratic in the early stages, was unhurried in the early going, saved
ground to the top of the lane and was not a factor. ONE ARROW tracked the solid pace from the second flight, lost position on the turn and gave way.
SOMETHINGNEFARIOUS showed early speed and disputed the pace to the turn, chased EXTINGUISHER along the turn, dropped back in upper stretch
and tired.

Footnotes
BOLD DAUGHTER was shuffled leaving the start and was away a bit slowly, was allowed to settle, saved ground along the turn, loomed in upper stretch,
closed well in the late stages, confronted RUNAWAY PRINCESS in deep stretch and determinedly prevailed in the final strides. RUNAWAY PRINCESS
broke alertly, showed good early speed and dictated terms to the turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear nearing the furlong grounds,
was all out to hold off BOLD DAUGHTER in deep stretch and was tagged on the line for the win, while besting the rest. EXQUISITE LEGACY chased from
midpack in the early stages, was carried out six wide nearing the top of the lane, finished well in the final furlong, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch
and secured third in the late stages. TIZ A TIGER chased from the second flight, raced three wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and offered a
mild late rally. KIND BUT SHE LIES showed early speed and stalked the pace to the turn, drifted midway through the turn and carried out rivals nearing the
top of the lane, chased the pacesetter to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. DADDYS NINA stalked the early pace, came in tight entering the
turn, found room while still close up approaching the quarter marker, chased RUNAWAY PRINCESS to mid-stretch and gave way. CLUBHOUSE WAVE
was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the pace from the inside on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. COUSIN
NIECEY chased the early pace, improved position while two wide on the turn and did not mount a late rally. NENE ROMANO chased the pace from the
second flight, was carried five wide nearing the quarter marker by a drifting KIND BUT SHE LIES, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late response.
TEXAS CHARM lunged at the start and was off slowly, lacked early speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
THE LITTLE H MAN settled off of the fast early pace, raced two wide along the turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed with a rush in deep
stretch, came within aim in the final yards and was up in the final strides to prevail. HORSE DOCTOR showed early speed, took back off of the fast pace
and stalked to the turn, pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, assumed command in upper stretch and drew clear to mid-stretch, was kept to steady
urging while holding foes at bay in the late stages and was nailed in the final strides, while holding in the end for second. MR. MASON tracked the early
pace, raced two wide along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, made a good late rally inside of the top pair, could not reel in those rivals in the final
stages and held well for third. ARMA D'ORO lacked early speed, raced three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive, found his best stride late
and challenged for third in the final strides. HANDR'SDREAM showed early speed and was up close to the fast early pace, advanced three wide on the turn,
chased HORSE DOCTOR to the furlong marker, could not keep pace in deep stretch and was edged for the minor awards. SIERRA MELODY broke alertly
then took back to track the fast early pace, lost ground on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late response. SATANTA was unhurried in the
early stages, improved position four wide on the turn, swung widest for the drive and did not threaten. EXHORTATION lacked early speed and was not a
factor. UNTO THEE bobbled at the start then was hustled to the early lead, set the pressured pace to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and
tired.

Footnotes
MISS BELLIMBUSTO stalked the early pace, saved ground along the turn, waited for room nearing the top of the lane, tipped out two wide for the drive,
advanced in mid-stretch to come within aim of ROSE OF MOONCOIN, dove inside of that rival for the final sixteenth, kept to task and made a determined
late surge to prevail in the final strides. ROSE OF MOONCOIN tracked the moderate early fractions, loomed four wide on the turn, assumed command in
upper stretch, was set down for the drive, felt pressure from the oncoming MISS BELLIMBUSTO, met that bid and was gamely bested in the final strides,
while besting the rest. LIKE NO OTHER hesitated at the start and was off a step slowly, trailed to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, came in
tight in mid-stretch, shifted out and made a good late rally in the final sixteenth to secure third. DELUSIVELY was bumped at the start and was away a step
slowly, raced in the second flight to the turn, came two wide to the quarter marker, rallied four wide in the drive, finished well in the final sixteenth and just
missed for third. CORNELIA FORT showed early speed and stalked the pace to the turn, advanced to press the moderate pace to the quarter marker, could
not match strides in upper stretch and gave way. MO TOWN GAL was forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace while three wide to
the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and weakened. RAUCOUS TIZZY chased the early pace, lost position three wide on the turn and was not a
late threat. FOREVER LOVELY broke alertly and showed good early speed, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, could not keep pace in the drive
and faded. HALLELUJAH BABY lacked early speed, chased the moderate pace while outside of rivals on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and did
not factor.

STAR RACER showed early speed and was prominent in the early stages, pressed the pace to the quarter marker, battled with SHOULD BE ILLEGAL to
mid-stretch, found more in the final furlong and kicked clear in the late stages. TERRY'S BOY tracked the early pace, raced three wide to the quarter
marker, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, was outfinished by STAR RACER in the final stages and was best of the rest. PLAYING HARDBALL
chased from the second flight, raced two wide along the turn, improved position in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and kept on in the final stages to
secure third. SHOULD BE ILLEGAL was sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker while holding STAR RACER at bay, battled with
that rival to mid-stretch but could not keep pace in the final furlong, weakened in the late stages and was edged for third. REFI NOW tracked the early pace,
was well positioned along the turn while saving ground, lost ground in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. SHUT UP MICHAEL (IRE) chased the pace,
saved ground on the turn and did not threaten in the drive. AWESOME DUDE lost his path at the start, took up and was away slowly, chased three wide on

Footnotes
CHANCERY WAY broke alertly and showed good early speed, set fast fractions while prompted to the quarter marker, shook free in upper stretch and drew
clear nearing the furlong marker, drifted out in the late stages, had the lead cut into in deep stretch and kept to task in the end to prevail. BIG SUMMER
settled off of the fast early pace while not far back, raced two wide along the turn, ran evenly to the furlong grounds, rallied in deep stretch while on the left
lead, could not reel in the winner in the final stages and won the nod for second. TAM'S LITTLE ANGEL tracked the fast early pace from the second flight,
raced four wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in the final stages and just missed for place, while earning the nod for show. SHEZA
GIRLY GIRL steadied off of heels in the early stages, settled off of the early pace, raced two wide along the turn, loomed in upper stretch, finished well in
deep stretch and just missed for the minor awards. ALL DIALED IN was a bit slow into early stride, lacked speed in the early stages, advanced three wide
on the turn, made a steady bid in the drive and found her best stride late. LUXURY LINER was prominent in the early stages and pressed the fast pace,
kept close attendance to CHANCERY WAY to the quarter marker, lost ground to that rival in upper stretch and weakened in the final stages. TIP TOP GAL
steadied in tight quarters behind SHEZA GIRLY GIRL in the early stages, lacked speed along the turn, saved ground to the quarter marker and offered a
mild late rally. CAROLINA MIA showed early speed and stalked the fast pace to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper
stretch and gave way. HOT RAGEOUS tracked the early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and weakened.
EXACTLY WENDY lacked early speed and was not a factor.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY GAL broke well, settled into a stalking position behind WORTHY OF MAGIC while under a hold always travelling comfortably, was asked to pick
up the pace passing the quarter pole, responded to strong handling, battled that stubborn foe the length of the stretch and gained the advantage in the final
strides. WORTHY OF MAGIC seized the lead from the break, was allowed to set moderate fractions while alone in front, was tackled from the outside by
GHOSTLY GAL at the head of the stretch, met the challenge and gave way grudgingly in the final yards. BANDEENA settled well behind the pacesetter
while under a hold through the first turn, was set down near the five-sixteenths, responded to encouragement from the rider, chased the top pair home and
was gaining on them at the wire. ZELAIA hustled from the gate to gain the rail, backed off was content to track the pace while in hand, saved ground
throughout and finished well. MOMMA MOCCA settled mid-pack early well in hand, made a move towards the lead through the far turn, made a three-wide
bid at the top of the stretch but stalled in the final eighth of a mile. VRONSKY FEINT was outrun to the first turn and had to take a four wide path in the early
going, was asked for more passing the seven-sixteenths pole, had to wait for some room at the head of the stretch but had nothing to offer when clear.
BELLEO'S FOREST raced three wide and between horses through the first turn and down the backstretch, was asked for more passing the half-mile marker
but failed to find the needed late run. SACRED BEAUTY last away from the gate, ran at the rear of the field, made a mild bid in the stretch but could make
an impact. DERRYGOOLIN encountered some traffic trouble and was five-wide into the first turn, raced near the rear of the field and wide down the
backsretch, launched a bid from the three-eighths pole and finished evenly but failed to gain ground. ASCENDANCY broke sharply and pulled the rider
towards the leaders while four wide through the first turn, continued to fight the rider down the backstretch, attempted to bolt passing the three furlong pole,
dropped to last and was not a late factor.
