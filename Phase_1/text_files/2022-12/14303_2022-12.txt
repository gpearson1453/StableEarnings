Footnotes
MERAVIGLIOSO chased the pace, raced in the four path leaving the turn, battled inside HONOR YOUR MOTHER through the stretch and prevailed in an
extended drive. HONOR YOUR MOTHER circled foes on the turn, was five deep turning for home, battled outside the winner and finished willingly. MO
FIRE , in the two path on the turn and in the stretch, rallied slightly. DIVINE FASHION hugged the inner rail on the turn and through the stretch and lacked
the needed late effort. SCAMPER ALONG lacked speed, raced two wide on the turn, swung outside near the sixteenth pole and passed tired horses.
PLEASE MARRY ME sped to the early lead, set the pace well off the rail, raced in the three path entering the stretch and gave way. GOLDEN ACCOUNT ,
three wide on the turn, was not a factor. MEJORAMIGA , no factor, drifted to the seven path in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SHE'SAROLLINGSTONE rated kindly while close up and saving ground, sat chilly as a duel developed into the turn, eased out and ranged up four wide to
engage the leaders past the five sixteenths, was roused clear soon into the lane, widened and was kept to solid encouragement to deep stretch.
VODKATINI stalked off the inside, edged up and bid three deep into the far turn, dueled on a short lead past the five sixteenths, failed to contain the winner
entering the lane but stayed on gamely to outdo others for the place. OH MRS. MAISEL went clear early and secured the inside, set a moderate pace, met
outside bids leaving the half mile marker, sparred inside rivals to upper stretch then gave way grudgingly in the final furlong. ANILEATE settled in the clear
and allowed the pace battle develop up front, came under a solid ride near the three eighths, ranged up five wide approaching the stretch to have aim but
hung. LA SAMANA LAURA prompted the pace outside the leader, applied pressure after a half mile, fought on between foes past the three eighths, failed to
kick on nearing the lane and weakened. MISTY'S BANSHEE lacked speed and was outrun.

Footnotes
TARGE broke alertly, saved ground around the turn, battled inside PEAK OF CHIC the final three furlongs and determinedly prevailed. PEAK OF CHIC
disputed the pace outside the winner and just missed in a game effort. BETCHA BY GOLLY bumped after hopping a bit at the beak, raced along the inner
rail through out and rallied gamely. DEVILISH AFFAIR raced in the three path on the turn while stalking the duel and gradually weakened in the drive.
MELODIOUS SINGER bore in leaving the starting gate bumping BETCHA BY GOLLY, was forwardly placed in the two path around the turn and weakened
in thed rive. LADY MACHO raced in the two path on the turn and was not a factor. FLAVA'S DREAM , three wide on the turn, floated to the six path in upper
stretch and was outrun. TIZ SUSAN ANN , four deep on the turn, drifted to the seven path entering the stretch.

BOSS LOGIC , off the pace and to the inside of a rival near the three eighths, shifted out under pressure heading to the quarter pole, straightened to be
about five to six wide, made a grinding run under strong handling and forged to command in the final yards. RAD PAISLEY vied inside MONTAUK DADDY
early on, eased back off the pace into the turn, was under pressure pursing past the five sixteenths, stayed towards the rail and bid inside foes to take a slim
lead with an eighth remaining, spurted clear a sixteenth out, kept on gamely but just failed to hold. MONTAUK DADDY showed sharp speed in hand and to
the outside of a rival, moved clear leaving the far turn, remained in front into the lane, responded to asking then was hooked from both sides in mid stretch,
kept on past the sixteenth marker, drifted out and gave way grudgingly. CELTIC TREASURE , outside a rival and under asking leaving the three eighths,
shifted out in the final furlong and had belated interest between foes. CAN'T PASS IT UP , off the pace, swung six wide into the lane, was floated wider in
deep stretch and churned on. VALIANT VINNY had speed then was taken in hand to track three wide, moved up and challenged for command nearing mid
stretch, failed to sustain and weakened in the final yards. U S CONSTITUTION saved some ground early, faltered and was eased through the final furlong.

three eighths, secured the inside for the stretch run, leveled off under solid handling past the three sixteenths, snuck through to the inside of a rival heading
to the sixteenth marker, sustained and got up in the final yards. JOHN THE BEAR rated outside a rival early on as the leader cleared off, steadily advanced
into the turn and took aim, moved to engage after a half mile, took over into the lane, wandered outward while clear and under a drive in mid stretch,
continued to drift and just failed. DIXIE DRAWL broke a step slow, recovered settled off the pace while removed from the inside, came under pressure mid
turn, circled five wide into the lane and rallied. MR. HUSTLE settled in the clear early on, moved up three wide under asking into the lane, altered out past
the three sixteenths and churned on. BACKNTHEWOODS sped clear early, set the pace towards the inside, staved off JOHN THE BEAR from the three
eighths to the head of the lane, wandered outward past mid stretch and weakened. SHOOT THEMESSENGER , sluggish early, saved ground into and
through the lane and had belated action. TREASURE TRADITION stalked outside a rival early, angled out and circled four wide around the turn, drifted in
near the three sixteenths and faded. BOBBY G lagged back, raced three to four wide into the lane and offered a mild kick. TOM HAGEN edged up towards
the inside nearing the half mile marker, chased and gave way.

Footnotes
MALIBU MOONSHINE , forced in by ANGEL ART soon after the break, circled the turn five deep, floated to the six path at the head of the stretch, drifted in
a bit when taking the lead in upper stretch then drew out under urging. FAST TRACKED bumped with ROWSIE EXPRESS soon after leaving the chute,
moved up in the five path between horses entering the stretch, bumped with SKYLAR'S SISTER when floated in a bit by the winner in upper stretch and
finished gamely. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA saved ground on the turn and rallied inside horses. CHICKIENESS set the pace near the inner rail around the
turn and weakened through the stretch. SKYLAR'S SISTER prompted the pace outside CHICKIENESS, was well placed in the three path turning for home,
bumped with FAST TRACKED in upper stretch and weakened. LIQUIDATOR chased the pace, raced near the rail inside horses on the turn and gave way.
CYNERGY'S ELECTRA was not a factor. ANGEL ART bore in leaving the starting gate, raced in the two path on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and
came up empty. ROWSIE EXPRESS bumped with FAST TRACKED leaving the chute then was outrun. TOUISSET , three wide on the turn, chased the
pace and faltered. An objection by the rider of FAST TRACKED against the winner for alleged interference in upper stretch was not allowed.

Footnotes
POST TIME settled off the early pace, angled out and was given his cue leaving the far turn, quickly gained four wide under some hand urging past the five
sixteenths, shifted out a bit soon into the lane, cruised up and overtook JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY with a furlong remaining then drew out with complete
authority as his rider sat motionless. JOHNYZ FROM ALBANY sped to the front, set a rated pace off the inside around the turn, was guided out and set
down as the winner closed in near the three sixteenths, failed to contain that one in mid stretch but kept on with effort to be clearly second best.
COFFEEWITHCHRIS prompted the pace outside the leader, came under pressure mid turn, drifted in some past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. TIZ
NO CLOWN , off the pace, raced three wide into the lane and failed to make an impact. FEELING WOOZY , four wide stalking early on, failed to kick on with
the leaders while under heavy pressure past the three eighths, dropped back then lacked a serious stretch response. CALIFORNIA GHOST , between rivals
with pursuit into the turn, gave way. TIDEWATER saved ground with pursuit, stayed in range to the quarter pole then weakened.
