Footnotes
PEPPERMAN was off slow to begin, saved ground to the stretch, rallied along the rail, took over past the sixteenth pole and kicked clear to win going away.
MR NAVIGATOR stalked two wide early, rounded the far turn two to three wide, bid three deep with a furlong remaining, was floated in, brushed and
crowded by CHRIS FIX in the furlong grounds and kept on gamely to earn the place. CHRIS FIX brushed leaving the gate, went two to three wide around
the first turn at the back early, chased three to four wide around the far turn, bid four deep in the final furlong, lugged in and brushed rival then took over
briefly at the sixteenth pole, relinquished the lead to PEPPERMAN shortly after and got edged for the place. ROARING TIGER brushed leaving the gate,
stalked the pacesetter on the inside, continued to save ground to the stretch, bid from inside past the three-sixteenths pole but faltered in the final sixteenth.
KAI'S STATEMENT took control and moved inside, led clear two wide into the stretch, challenged with three-sixteenths remaining, lost command past the
eighth pole, was forced to check late and dropped back to fifth. SAFE COMBINATION brushed leaving the gate, settled in the three path while rank early,
continued to fight the rider up the backstretch, stayed off the rail into the lane and could not rally. MY LITTLE TAYLOR tracked three then four wide on the
clubhouse turn, remained off the rail and was asked four wide leaving the second bend and tired in the stretch run. CHANGED HALF AND FINAL TIMES

Footnotes
KRIXUS FLASH sent for the lead along the rail, set the pace inside ANTICIPATED then lost command nearing the half-mile pole, stayed alongside to the far
turn then chased the leader around that bend in the two path, came back in the final sixteenth and got up in the final moments. VIOLET CROWN raced up
close between foes on the first turn, dropped back to stalk and angled to the inside, went up to take over nearing the half-mile pole, kicked clear on the far
turn, drifted out in the final furlong, led clear into deep stretch but got nailed by the winner. LORD OF LIGHT chased four wide then moved into the three
path around the first turn, chased between on the second bend, drifted out and brushed rival in the lane, kept on willingly in range of the top pair but lacked
the needed late punch. ANTICIPATED pressed three deep then outside the leader early, could not keep up leaving the backstretch, chased three deep
around the far turn, got brushed by LORD OF LIGHT in the lane, angled inward and failed to rally. DRUIDIC chased four deep around both turns, steadied
when ANTICIPATED came out a bit midstretch and could not rally. MR. FIGHTER broke slow then took up between rivals at the start, chased on the inside
to the stretch and weakened.

and got put in tight between rivals in upper stretch and kept on to round out the superfecta. A BROKEN BREEZE raced between rivals at the back into the

stalked the pace on the inside, raced a bit off the rail into the stretch, moved out in the lane and flattened. GALARINA set the pace under pressure up the
backstretch, led clear through the turn and two to three wide into the stretch, drifted out in upper stretch and weakened. SAILING ALONG was off a bit slow

Footnotes
BIG TALKER was in a bit tight between leaders into the first turn, moved back and into the two path, angled to the inside then back off the rail and loomed
two wide into the stretch, took over in upper stretch, kicked clear and powered away in the final furlong. SALTO DE TIGRE settled three then two wide early,
angled out on the far turn and came five wide into the stretch and rallied for the place honors. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY dueled for the lead inside a rival,
inched ahead then cleared past the three-eighths pole, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened to third. SONIC BREES stalked three deep early,
spun four wide into the lane and lacked the needed response when called upon. TODAY MATTERS raced two wide then moved inside, continued along the
rail then moved out around the second bend, steered out into the stretch and lacked a rally. SUMO dueled for the lead from outside, kept the pressure on to
the three-eighths pole then chased the leader three wide leaving the turn, faded in the drive, eased in the final furlong and walked off.

SMILE FOR GLORY sped to the front and crossed over, led on the inside then two wide into the stretch, put to left and right handed urging in the lane and
drew off. CAROL'S COMIC stalked four deep early, moved into the three path around the turn, raced in traffic behind rivals at the quarter pole, angled out
and then rallied between foes late and got up for second. MAGNIFICENT RIDE was off slow to begin, trailed early, rounded the bend three then four wide,
chased three deep in the final sixteenth and got edged for the place honors. LEMON DROP SHOT stalked the pacesetter on the inside, loomed along the
rail into the stretch, switched out at the three-sixteenths pole, failed to summon the needed response and got outkicked for the place and show. AGADOR
SPARTACUS attended the pace three deep then came four wide into the stretch and faded. STAMP MY PASSPORT came away slow, went up to press the

Footnotes
RESPECTFULLY sped to the front from inside, drifted out a bit on the turn, then kicked clear and drew away in the stretch run. TROUVILLE got crowded
between rivals leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter from inside, coaxed two wide into the lane, could not threaten the winner in the final furlong but
stayed on to prove second best. CRIMSON ROSE tracked three deep into the turn, remained three wide into the stretch, drifted in and had to steady briefly
behind TROUVILLE midstretch and kept to task to gain the show. DOUBLE FANTASY raced up close three deep early, spun five wide into the lane and
weakened. SO IT WOULD SEEM forwardly placed outside the pacesetter, took aim four wide into the stretch but flattened in the late stages. HARPER'S
GALLOP chased widest early on, came six wide into the drive and failed to threaten. INVINCIBELLA (GB) had her path taken shortly after the start, tracked
between rivals into the turn, got put in tight and checked hard early on the bend, angled down to the inside and could not rally.

Footnotes
DEVIL AMONG US broke a step slow then went up to take control from inside, came off the rail on the turn and showed the way three wide into the drive,
met the challenge from THIRSTY PAPPY to the outside, disposed of that rival past the three-sixteenths pole and padded the lead in the furlong grounds.
THIRSTY PAPPY chased three deep early, bid three wide on the turn and four wide into the stretch, could not keep up with three-sixteenths remaining and
stayed on to secure second. CATHEDRAL LIGHT tracked two wide and between rivals into the turn, got carried out into the stretch and was along for the
show. MY RANSOM chased three deep into the turn, got carried five wide into the stretch and earned minor award. LOGON TO WIN was forwardly placed
two wide into the turn, angled to the inside on the turn and weakened down the lane. SPIRITUAL ADVISOR was off slow to begin, tracked three deep into
the turn, exited the bend five wide and lacked a rally. BRONKO NAGURSKI was off a step slow and came out in the beginning, went two to three wide into
the stretch, moved out in the lane and improved position. EDDIE CROSSWIRE drifted out and brushed rival early then chased off the pace, rounded the
bend four then five wide and failed to threaten. CALCULATED SPIN got brushed by inner rival early, raced near the back off the rail, took the turn two to
three wide and never responded. CHARBONNEAU stalked the pace on the inside, came out into the stretch and faded. BRONZE ONE was off slow and lost
his path at the start, angled in on the turn and failed to menace.
