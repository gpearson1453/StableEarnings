Footnotes
LOLLY EXPRESS showed no early speed, raced from off the rail through the second turn, angled out further into the lane, reached the fore with a sixteenth
to run and was fully extended to prevail. LOOKIN FOR EIGHT lacked early speed, raced six-wide through the second turn, rider lost whip in mid-stretch and
finished willingly under a hand ride. BERNALINHO settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with good late
energy. HPNOTIQ RHYTHM was away in good order to open a clear margin before going a quarter, raced three-wide while setting the pace and gave way
through the final furlong. STALKING SHADOW was forwardly placed from the inside and gave way through the final furlong.0. DR. TROUTMAN was off
slow, pulled to contend, chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters.

HELLO BABY lacked early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and held off the closing SHE SAID MY WAY to
prevail. SHE SAID MY WAY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the sixteenth pole and rallied late to be
gaining on the winner. MIZHIPZLETUS was away in good order to dispute the pace while racing four-wide from between foes, moved up to take command
nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. PLUM ROSE settled off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and finished with a belated
bid. DEELITEFUL LIZZY pressed the pace while racing five-wide, offered a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker and gave way in the drive. EASTER
GRACE lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. LITTLE LILY LU disputed the pace from the inside and weakened after
going a half. LEGAL MISCHIEF vied of the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after a half.

Footnotes
SPEEDING STYLE dueled for the lead from the inside with INSTIGATE, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear margin and held off the
closing LINCHTOWN to prevail. LINCHTOWN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, was bumped by MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY into
the lane and was gaining on the winner late when clear. WEARENOTBADPEOPLE was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, reached a striking
position into the stretch and finished evenly late. ANDY BOBBY was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn, angled out in
mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. MISCHIEVOUSHOLIDAY was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out to bump LINCHTOWN nearing the
three-sixteenths marker and failed to gain when clear. INSTIGATE disputed the pace with the winner while racing three-wide and gave way after going a
half. DEPUTY'S DANCER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. HEY JASPER settled off the leaders early, moved
five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. LIE AND DENY raced off the pacesetters early, lugged out through the turn and did not offer a bid. DIRT
ROAD DOLLARS raced off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. JOKERIN lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. BOBBY BUCKETS showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.
