Footnotes
AIR FORCE RED sprinted to the front, crossed over to the two path then moved to the rail on the turn, showed the way along the inside into the stretch, put
to left handed urging in the lane and remained clear to the wire. LANE WAY forwardly placed on the inside, saved ground to the stretch, moved off the rail
and took aim at the winner but could not summon the needed late kick and had to settle for second best. GREGORIAN CHANT (GB) sat off the pace, went
two wide into the turn then angled over to the rail, remained inside to the stretch and summoned a mild rally to gain the show. SMOOTH LIKE STRAIT
stalked the pacesetter from outside, entered the lane two to three wide, kept on through the drive but never produced a late bid. IRIDEO (ARG) traveled
toward the rear on the inside into the bend, eased off the rail and exited the dirt three wide, tipped out further in the lane but failed to threaten.
WHATMAKESSAMMYRUN raced in range a bit off the rail then two wide across the dirt, tipped out at the top of the stretch and failed to rally. KISS TODAY
GOODBYE trailed off the rail to the stretch and was not a factor. FRONT RUN THE FED broke a bit slow, entered the turn two wide, raced outside a rival
and four wide into the stretch and could not make an impact. SIGILOSO tracked outside a rival early, three wide leaving the turn, moved out a bit in the lane
and weakened. HIT THE ROAD sat off the pace three deep then moved into the two path on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
BOLD ENDEAVOR showed early speed and vied in the two path into the first turn, pressed the leader from between rivals to the far turn, moved up on even
terms at the five-sixteenths pole, took over with a quarter mile remaining, dueled with ROYAL ACT down the stretch and held gamely. ROYAL ACT vied for
the lead three wide into the first turn then took back to stalk the trio around the turn, tracked widest up the backstretch, bid four wide then three deep on the
far turn, battled outside BOLD ENDEAVOR through the lane and could not get by. ORDER AND LAW brushed with inner rival leaving the gate, tracked two
then three wide around the first turn, continued in the same paths on the second bend and outkicked BALADI for the show. BALADI stumbled in the
beginning, chased the leaders along the rail, moved to the two path on the far turn, churned on down the stretch and got edged for the show honors.
IMPOSSIBLE TASK sent inside outside trio early to take control along the rail, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, headed by rival midway around
the bend, relinquished the lead at the quarter pole and weakened down the lane. ALL EYES WEST bumped leaving the gate, vied four then three deep
around the first turn, could not keep up with the top pair leaving the backstretch, chased three wide then trailed four wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
QUEEN GODDESS sped to the front outside rivals then cleared and moved inward, controlled the pace through the early stages, held a comfortable lead
through the far turn, roused in upper stretch, urged once right handed and was never challenged. CLOSING REMARKS got put in a bit tight along the rail
then rated on the inside early, saved ground through the far turn while closest in pursuit of QUEEN GODDESS, chased within range through the stretch run
but could never summon the needed late kick to threaten the winner while proving second best. QUATTROELLE (IRE) settled in mid-pack outside a rival,
eased out four wide on the far turn and kept on to gain the show honors. ENGLAND'S ROSE was taken back and reserved in the early stages, traveled two
wide then came three wide into the stretch and showed a mild rally to round out the superfecta. WARRENS CANDY GIRL raced on the inside at the back in
the early going, continued to save ground around the far turn, altered out from behind rivals with a furlong remaining and improved placings.
BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) had to steady off heels briefly early, raced towards the rear a bit off the rail, traveled two wide on the far turn, moved out a bit in the
lane and could not rally. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) bumped leaving the gate then got crowded between rivals shortly after, traveled along the rail into the
first turn then moved to the two path, continued a bit off the rail into the second bend, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to rally. NEW HEAT
traveled in the two path at the back, moved out in the stretch and could not make an impact. SCARABEA settled on the inside, cut the corner into the
stretch, tipped out and failed to menace. ISLAND OF LOVE (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter outside a rival, chased two wide into the
lane and faded.

Footnotes
BRIGHT LEAF tracked the speed in the two path, rallied between into the final furlong then inside the AMERICAN CAT late and got up. AMERICAN CAT set
the pace outside ENCODE up the backstretch and around the turn, cleared that rival into the stretch, challenged in the final sixteenth and got overtaken
nearing the wire. AMERICAN REFUGEE chased off the inside, went three wide around the bend, tipped out and took aim from outside in the lane, finished
willingly but could not find the needed final kick to get by. STREET ART traveled towards the rear early on, raced along the rail then angled out leaving the
bend and improved position. KANT BEAT THE ROCK tracked four wide around the bend, got floated out a bit into the stretch and could not rally. ENCODE
pressed the pace from inside into and around the turn, lost touch entering the lane, stayed within range into the final furlong then flattened in deep stretch.
ONCOMING trailed off the rail up the backstretch, went four wide into the turn, five wide into the stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
KATERINI stalked the speed outside rivals early on, bid three deep on the turn, drifted out a bit while taking over past the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper
stretch and drew away. REAL FIRE forwardly placed early and closest in pursuit leaving backstretch, challenged around the turn and took over at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost command past the quarter pole, entered the lane two wide and held the place. ALBAYAADER (IRE) sat off the pace, raced
between foes into the turn, traveled two wide then angled out to the four path around the bend and summoned a mild rally to earn the show honors. ABOVE
SUSPICION trailed on the inside into the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and also came with a mild rally to earn a minor award. BUY AMERICAN
stalked the pace from inside early, tipped off the rail and chased two wide into the stretch but lacked a late bid. SADDLE UP JESSIE raced near the back
then moved closer three deep, had to steady a bit off heels at the seven-sixteenths pole, came three deep into the stretch and could not rally. CAILIN
DIANA chased between early then in the two path, got brushed at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened out. AMAGE settled inside, saved ground through
the turn, tipped out and brushed rival at the three-sixteenths pole and never responded to urging. MISSING PENNY sprinted to the front from outside,
crossed over to the inside and showed the way to the turn, lost command at the five-sixteenths pole, started to weaken leaving the turn and gave way down
the lane. AGREE TO SETTLE broke a bit slow, steadied early then bobbled crossing surfaces early, raced three deep near the back into the turn, two to
three wide into the stretch and was not a factor. OLIVIA'S CHOICE (IRE) was off slow in the beginning, moved into range four deep, drifted out a bit on the
turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
LADY T tracked four deep early, urged along through the turn while three deep then exited the bend four wide, put to right handed urging in upper stretch,
reeled in the top pair at the sixteenth pole and drove clear. MANORELLI showed early speed then dueled inside DORIS MAE for command, fought through
the turn and into the stretch, regained the advantage outside the sixteenth pole but yielded to the winner in the late stages. DORIS MAE went up to duel
outside MANORELLI, inched ahead past the five-sixteenths pole, battled into the furlong grounds, lost the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and faltered to
third. SAMURAI CHARM stalked the pace up the backstretch, raced along the rail then two wide into the lane, angled out at the top of the stretch but failed
to find the needed late kick. LEXINGTON HUMOR chased three deep between foes, moved into the two path for the turn, tipped out leaving the bend,
moved out further in the lane and could not rally. VIOLENT RUNNER raced up close then chased the top pair into the turn, rounded the bend two then three
wide, came out in midstretch and could not rally. ANACAPA chased between then moved inside, angled out on the turn and entered the lane four wide,
steered out further in the stretch and failed to threaten. CLASSICAL ROMANCE trailed up the backstretch, went three wide into the turn, exited the bend six
wide and was never a factor.

Footnotes
CODE DUELLO trailed up the backstretch, moved to the inside, angled out into the stretch, closed steadily through the lane and got up in time. VIRAT
stalked the top pair from outside, ran two then three wide around the turn, bid in upper stretch, took over at the eighth pole, moved clear midstretch and got
caught nearing the wire. DOITFORANDREW (GB) got bumped hard leaving the gate, settled off the pace, went two wide outside a rival into the turn, angled
four wide leaving the turn, put in a mild late bid but needed more to threaten for the win. LOVESICK BLUES chased near the back on the inside, tipped out
into the stretch, moved out further in the lane and was on the move but had to steady in the final sixteenth, moved to a clear path and kept on for a minor
award. EXCEED SPEED LIMIT raced in range up the backstretch, chased two then three wide around the turn and could not rally. COMMANDER KHAI
dueled for the lead from outside, inched ahead with a quarter mile remaining, lost the lead into the final furlong and flattened in deep stretch. LAW ABIDING
dueled for command from inside, battled into the final furlong, then failed to kick on with VIRAT and flattened out. ALTRUIST sat off the pace between rivals,
traveled two wide then between foes again on the turn, raced three deep in upper stretch and failed to menace. SQUARE CAT stalked the pace on the
inside into the turn, entered the lane two wide, lacked room with a furlong remaining and could not regain momentum. I'LL STAND TALLER veered in and
bumped rival in the beginning, raced three deep on the turn, moved out in the lane and weakened. CREATIVE PEAK traveled in mid-pack on the inside into
the turn, cut the corner into the lane and weakened.
