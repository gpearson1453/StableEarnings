Footnotes
UNWRITTEN CODE sped to the front inside BIG MAMA THORNTON then cleared, led two wide around the turn, drifted into the stretch, coaxed through the
lane and drew away under left handed encouragement. EMILY SMILES broke out and bumped rival, stalked off the rail then got put in a bit tight between
rivals past the five-eighths pole, went four wide into the turn, got floated to the five path then bumped with rival near the five-sixteenths pole, came four wide
into the stretch, moved in some and finished willingly for second. DRIZELLA bumped leaving the gate, raced up close outside a rival, was closest in pursuit
from the three path on the turn, moved out and took aim five wide into the lane, failed to produce a bid and managed to hold third. CHAO MAR broke a step
slow, chased on the inside at the back, two wide into the drive and improved position. SECRET MANEUVER got pinballed leaving the gate, went three wide
into the turn, moved into the two path then back to the three path leaving the turn and failed to menace. BIG MAMA THORNTON was forwardly placed in
the early going, lost ground three to four wide on the turn and bumped with outer rival near the five-sixteenths pole, then faded down the lane.

outside rivals up the backstretch, chased three then four wide on the far turn, lacked a late bid but held the show. OF GOOD REPORT chased four deep
and five wide early then angled to the two path on the clubhouse turn, tracked two wide into the far turn, angled down to the rail and failed to threaten.
GLENROY bumped inner rival at the start, chased four wide outside rivals early, four deep up the backstretch, trailed into the far turn, came four wide into
the stretch and had little left for the drive. DEVOTED TO YOU sped to the front in the two path while inside several runners then moved clear, showed the
way up the backstretch then was challenged near the half-mile pole, lost command into the far turn, could not keep up with the winner around the bend,
spun two wide into the lane and tired. ACTIVE ACCOUNT got bumped leaving the gate, raced up close three wide outside the leader into the first turn,
chased off the rail then moved inside for the far turn and tired.

Footnotes
CAST MEMBER chased two to three wide early, coaxed four wide leaving the far turn, drew alongside the leader at the three-sixteenths pole, took over in
midstretch and held off GRAZED MY HEART in the final furlong while drifting inward. GRAZED MY HEART broke a step slow, trailed two wide early,
passed a rival on the far turn while continuing two wide into the stretch, drifted in and out while rallied inside the leaders and lacked the needed late punch to
get by the winner. COCKTAIL PRINCESS sprinted to the front and moved inward, led clear up the backstretch, showed the way two wide into the drive,
challenged by CAST MEMBER with three-sixteenths to go, relinquished the lead shortly after and flattened to third. BIG CELEBRATION brushed the gate,
chased along the inside then drifted out and bumped rival early on the clubhouse turn, was closest in pursuit from off the rail into the far turn, took aim three
wide leaving that bend and weakened in the stretch run. LOYAL TO A FAULT got bumped by BIG CELEBRATION and moved to the three path early on the
first turn, stalked off the rail in the middle stages, angled to the rail on the far turn, tired in the lane and was not persevered with in the final furlong.

HOT THOUGHTS brushed leaving the gate, set the pace in the early going, led two wide into the turn, three to four wide into the stretch and drew off under
a drive. MISS COMMANDER bumped leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter from outside, took the turn three wide, came four wide into the stretch, lugged
in from the right hand midstretch then again in the final sixteenth and kept on for a clear second. THIRSTY DATE brushed lightly with the winner at the start,
raced in range early, took the turn two then three wide, lacked a late bid but churned on to secure the show. DANCE KID was off slow to begin, raced three
then four wide around the turn off the pace and could not rally. MAGIC CAPITAL broke a step slow, chased four then five wide around the turn and failed to
menace. ROSIE ANN RULES stalked the leader on the inside, lost ground through the turn and faded. GIRL NAMED DORIS was off slow and bumped with
outer rival, trailed early and was maneuvered to the inside, saved ground around the bend and never got involved.

Footnotes
DADSTAR bumped outer rival at the start, went up to take control and set the pace, led in the two path then drifted to the four path, continued to drift out
through the lane while still leading comfortably and held safely in the end. CURLY ESA got put in a bit tight between rivals early, went two wide into the turn,
angled out and came six wide into the stretch, finished willingly down the lane to gain the place but never reached the winner. NORWESTER bumped
leaving the gate, raced in range outside a rival, traveled two wide then three wide on the turn and got outkicked for the place honors. CLUBHOUSE CAT
bumped with NORWESTER at the start, chased along the rail into the turn, two wide exiting the bend and lacked a late bid. MISSING MAURICE got
shuffled between rivals early, tracked two then three wide on the turn and failed to rally. VALIENTE broke a step slow, chased three deep then went four
wide into the turn, moved out and entered the lane seven wide and weakened. PAPA PRIMITIVO threw his head and spotted the field several lengths at the
start, trailed three then two wide on the turn and was not a factor. MONGOLIAN MOON stalked off the rail, came four to five wide into the stretch and
weakened.

Footnotes
HILLSTONE MARTINI dueled for the lead from inside, inched ahead then drifted four wide around the bend, kicked clear from ARDTREA and widened
through the lane. ARDTREA dueled for command from outside, kept the pressure on around the bend while getting floated out to the five path, could not
keep up into the stretch and stayed on to secure the place. TRUTH PREVAILS brushed at the start, chased three then two wide on the turn, moved inside in
the stretch and was along for the show. LIBERALISM broke a step slow, raced in range two wide into the turn, exited the bend four wide, moved in some
and lost the show. WARREN'S MEMORABLE bumped leaving the gate and dropped back to last, rounded the bend two wide, moved out in the lane and
improved position. AUNT OPAL popped the gate open but never left the stall, bobbled and brushed inner rival at the start, chased three deep then four wide
around the bend and could not rally. MEASUREOFDEVOTION settled off the pace outside a rival, navigated the turn four wide and lacked a rally. BLUE
BUTTERFLY broke in and bumped rival, stalked the top pair on the inside and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
MISTER BOLD tracked the pace on the inside, moved closer around the turn, rallied inside the leaders and edged the runner-up late. MANITOWISH
pressed the pace from outside early, lost touch around the bend and chased three wide into the lane, re-bid from outside and took over at the eighth pole,
led through the final sixteenth and got nailed in the closing moments. ALL EYES WEST broke well then dropped back, moved into range three wide up the
backstretch, spun four wide into the drive, finished willingly but could not summon the needed late kick to threaten the top pair. LET'S REJOYCE set the
pace under pressure from outside, cleared around the bend, led through the drive then lost command at the eight pole and flattened to fourth in the final
sixteenth. SELF TAUGHT broke slow and trailed early, came out into the stretch and improved position. HEARTFULLOFSTARS chased four wide into the
turn near the back of the field, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. OCTOPUS broke through the gate prior to the start, was off a
bit slow to begin, got put in tight early, chased four then five wide on the turn and weakened. SUNRISE JOURNEY tracked off the rail, two then three wide
on the turn and had little left in the drive.

MY SUMMER DREAM broke in and bumped rival, stalked two then three wide on the turn, tipped out in the lane and drove clear. CODE DUELLO vied for
command three deep into and around the turn, took over into the stretch, lost command at the eighth pole and stayed on well for second. BOCHOMBO
broke slow, stalked the pace from outside, rallied five wide and five deep into the stretch, failed to keep up at the top of the lane and churned on to hold the
show. KRAHENBUHL vied for command into and around the turn, lost touch with the leaders with three-sixteenths remaining and flattened to fourth.
SAFFA'S DAY raced in range early off the rail, traveled three wide into the turn, came out and went five wide into the lane and lacked a rally. GRAZEN SUN
bumped at the start, went up to fight for command between rivals, battled to upper stretch and weakened. GOLDEN IMAGE vied four deep to the stretch,
could not keep pace with the leaders in upper stretch and faded. NEPTUNE'S STORM was off a bit slow to begin, saved ground near the back, cut the
corner into the stretch and was not a factor. BETITO hopped at the start and came away slow, raced two wide outside a rival at the back on the turn and
never got involved.
