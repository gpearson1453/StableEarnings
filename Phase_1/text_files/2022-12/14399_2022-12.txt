Footnotes
INTO HAPPINESS hustled from the gate, chased two to three wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and leaned on DOLCE SERA at that station to
gain a clear lane, advanced to take command swinging four to five wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. CHARGING LADY
coaxed from the gate, raced four wide in aim of the front before advancing to duel with UGHROUDA briefly into the turn, tucked to the two path through that
bend and took over narrow command midway on the turn when placed to coaxing, yielded the front spinning three wide into upper stretch and ran on to
chase the winner home. GEOMETRIQUE chased three then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch and kicked
on belatedly to secure the show honors. UGHROUDA bobbled at the break under coaxing, dueled from the two path with MISCHIEF MOTION early on
before shaking off that rival and getting confronted by CHARGING LADY into the turn, tucked inside through the bend and was placed to a drive with
seven-sixteenths to go, yielded the front midway on the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. DOLCE SERA chased four to five
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths when leaned on by INTO
HAPPINESS, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. MISCHIEF MOTION dueled inside of UGHROUDA briefly before fading into the turn, spun
just off the inside into upper stretch, folded in the drive.

Footnotes
BELLA MICHELLE chased the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took the lead near the three-eighths, shook clear in the four
path at the quarter-pole, extended the advantage under a solid hand-ride into the final furlong and proved much the best while kept to the task under a
hand-ride to the wire. HYPNOCURRENCY broke in at the start, pressed the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the two path under urging while
between foes on the turn, lost touch with the winner into upper stretch, kept on with good courage in pursuit of that opponent in the stretch and was well
clear for the place. COOKIE CRUMBS bumped lightly with a foe outside the five-eighths, was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came
five wide into the stretch and weakened while best of the rest. IN GOOD TROUBLE broke in at the start, settled on the inside, saved ground around the turn,
came three wide into upper stretch and had nothing left. BANK BUSTER broke in at the start, went to the front, set the pace under pressure to her outside,
vied along the rail under urging on the turn, lost the advantage at the three-eighths, was taken in hand some around the five-sixteenths and faded. INDYAN
PENNY made mild contact with a foe outside the five-eighths, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and
capitulated. HOOCHIE COO dropped well behind while ridden along, went three to four wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
JAKE ROCKS hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from WIN FOR GOLD to the outside down the
backstretch before that rival advanced, dueled through the turn coming under urging at the five-sixteenths clinging to command, swung three wide into
upper stretch, dug in knocking heads through to the sixteenth marker stubbornly keeping command before inching away in the late stages to rebuff the
challenge and prevail gamely on the wire. WIN FOR GOLD coaxed from the start, prompted the aforementioned foe from the outside in the two path down
the backstretch before advancing to duel through the turn, got set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on unable to go
by before being ultimately repelled at the end while well clear of the rest for the place honors. WILL E SUTTON coaxed from the gate, chased three then two
wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and weakened in the stretch. EDDIE THE GREAT four then three wide in pursuit, got
coaxed along midway on the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. ALITE chased along the inside under a drive from the
seven-sixteenths, tipped three wide into upper stretch, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CUSTOMEREXPERIENCE settled comfortably off the pace, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path while closer to the front around the
five-sixteenths, was roused in upper stretch, closed fast to get the lead inside the furlong marker then drew clear under steady urging. HONEY MONEY was
reserved off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide on the turn, was roused into upper stretch and earned the place while unable to
go with the winner. ALARM CLOCK tracked the pace down the backstretch, moved up to make a bid with a half-mile to run, took the lead in the two path on
the turn, spun three wide into upper stretch, lost the advantage to the winner inside the furlong marker and weakened but just held the show. SHORT
SUMMER DRESS veered out at the start, settled towards the front on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back under a drive into upper
stretch, kept on in the final furlong, moved out late and just missed the show. EASY TO BLESS broke out at the start, settled off the pace, was urged along
late on the backstretch, chased two to three wide around the turn, spun five wide into the stretch under the crop, pursued the leader into the final furlong and
tired. SPOOKY ROAD was taken back along the rail early then angled to the outside, went four then five wide on the turn and failed to threaten. ITS COLD
IN DEHERE was coaxed along off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor. AEGEAN SEA was
sent hard to the front then went clear, came under threat near the half-mile pole, lost the lead under urging early on the turn and stopped.

CAPTAINSDAUGHTER chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, tipped out nearing the
eighth pole two paths and rallied to take command just inside that station, then edged away to the finish kept to task. VALLELUJAH chased three to four
wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch, dug in to be heads apart for command a furlong from home, ran on
willingly to secure the place honors. PRETTY CLEVER coaxed from the gate, dueled from the two path with SPIN A YARN to her inside, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, dug in and was collared just inside the eighth pole, ran on to preserve the show honors on
the line. HAPPY SOPHIA two to three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid a
furlong out, then kept on to the finish. KHALI MAGIC got forced to steady in behind rivals when squeezed out at the start, chased five wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and improved position by tired rivals. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY chased along the inside under a
ride from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide for home, made no impact. RIBOT'S VALENTINE chased along the inside under coaxing from the
three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. SPIN A YARN dueled along the inside of PRETTY CLEVER, came under
coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. CURLY GIRL chased just off the inside briefly until tucked inside with
nine-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
COLOR COMMISH was urged along on the outside, chased in the five to six path around the turn, pursued the runner-up under a drive into the final
sixteenth and got up under strong urging. DISARMED was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the four to five path
around the turn, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, dropped in while kicking clear in upper stretch, drifted out near the eighth-pole, led into the final
sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. MAX FOSTER was coaxed along on the inside of a foe, chased in the three to four path on the turn, was
driven five wide into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick while clear for the show. BRAD'S BET was urged along
off the pace, dropped from the three path to the two path early on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, moved out outside the furlong marker and
lacked the needed response. ZUCCARACE was ridden along on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and
failed to threaten. IN MY SHADOW was ridden along near the back, went three to four wide on the turn and showed little. LIEUTENANT SAM disputed the
pace on the inside of a rival, vied along the rail on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. FIRE KING contested the pace on the outside, vied in
the two path while between foes around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. THE CATILLAC KID was well placed down the
backstretch, saved ground under urging on the turn and came up empty. MILAGROSO broke out while off awkwardly and a bit slow, went two to three wide
on the turn and never reached contention. SARATOGA STRONG was taken in hand between foes despite room just after the start, angled in early, dropped
well behind the rest of the field, shifted from the rail to the four path early on the turn, moved to the five path later on that bend, came six wide into the
stretch and also showed little.

hand-ride into the final furlong then was eased up while much the best. SAFALOW'S MISSION was bumped hard on both sides at the start then checked
while pinched back, raced towards the rear, went three wide on the turn, drifted inward while improving position near the sixteenth-pole and got up for the
place. WARRIORS REVENGE bobbled at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased four wide on the turn and weakened while able to get the
show. MY LAST MISSION was forwardly placed on the outside, went five wide under urging on the turn and tired. PERSISTENT DANGER was urged along
off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. THE INSTITUTE steadied briefly while in tight near the five-eighths, moved from three to five
wide around the turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. CONSTANT KNIGHT broke out then bumped with a foe and was off a
bit slow, went five wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor. ZIRCON broke out and bumped hard with a foe, brushed with a
rival early, climbed into kickback near the five-eighths, saved ground around the turn and came up empty. ON THE HILL bumped hard with a rival at the
start, brushed with a foe early, chased the pace, went three wide around the turn and capitulated. OPEN TIL MIDNIGHT was bumped at the start and of a
bit slow, raced towards the back under urging, moved in outside the half-mile pole, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. TACO BEAN was urged
