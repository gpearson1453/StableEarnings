rail out of turn, moved up for show. TALK RADIO inside position to the turn with no late kick in final furlong. WITCH off rail trip to the turn, could not go on
and flattened out late. MAGICAL THOUGHT raced evenly while lacking a late response when needed in stretch. MY GOOD FORTUNE never menaced

Footnotes
OFFUTT COLE never far back to the turn, angled in a bit into stretch, clear. LONGER VIEW no speed to the turn, rallied into stretch, angled in mildly late.
MONTEREY PENINSULA raced evenly to the stretch with a mild run for show spot. WATERBOY no speed to the turn, closed the gap in the late stretch run.
ROBUST off tardy from gate, made up ground from the turn, finished well. KICK ROCKS KID dueled from two path into stretch, grudgingly late going.
SHERLOCKED raced evenly, with no late kick in the drive. GIRO D'ORO failed to menace. GO VIRTUAL squeezed back start, never threatened thereafter.
RA'S AL GHUL never menaced. PROTECTED AREA dueled inside to the turn, gave way readily in the stretch. WHEN IN ROME pressed pace three wide
to the turn, gave way. THE RIDE OF LONGER VIEW LODGED A CLIAM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER OFFUTT FOR INTERFEERIENCE INTO THE
STRETCH BUT DISALLOWD BY THE STEWARDS.
