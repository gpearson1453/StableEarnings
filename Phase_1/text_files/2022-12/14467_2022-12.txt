Footnotes
ROYAL CONSORT showed good early speed to set a fast pace along the inside and held a clear margin under a steady hand ride. HARD CANDY chased
the early pace near the inside, continued a rail bid around the far turn through the stretch and finished well to be second best. EUROBELIEVER chased the
pace from the outside of foes, raced three wide around the far turn and kept on to the wire. BOURBON DAY was off slowly, void of early speed, raced from
the inside past the three eighths pole, was five wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve position. PRINCE PERFECTA raced off the early going,
raced near the inside around the far turn into the stretch and lacked a bid. KING OF SONG chased the pace while racing two wide and gave way. EGOR
OTAY was coaxed along early and faded while racing four deep.

unhurried early on, moved up four wide near the quarter pole from the outside of foe and got up for the place position late. MEET ME rated along to race in
hand down the backstretch, challenged for the lead near the five sixteenths pole and weakened a bit late. CUSTOM FOR TINA broke to the outside, tracked
the early leader while racing between rivals and weakened a bit in the drive. MISS TARGET settled off the early going, moved up four wide nearing the
quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. MS. CAJUN QUEEN stalked the pace, raced along the inside into the upper stretch and weakened. MOLLI WAY

TAPIZARS SECRET showed good early foot and held well to draw clear late under strong handling. HULEN was bumped at the start, moved up three wide
near the five sixteenths pole, raced five deep into the upper stretch and finished second best. JAKE THE BAND MAN tracked the early pace while racing
two wide and kept on willingly to the wire. NOSBOR raced mid pack early on, was three to four deep in the lane and had not enough in the drive. WHY
JOEY WHY was bumped, shuffled back at the start, raced near the back of the pack early on, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and never was
a serious threat. I'M A SPECIAL STAR coaxed along from the inside to lay up close and tired while continuing to race near the rail. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR
raced off the early pace, was near the inside past the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
JOEBOY showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing just to the outside of rival early on, took command into the far turn and held gamely to be
clear under strong handling. M AND M'S CUSTOM stalked the early pace, three deep down the backstretch, moved up three to four wide in the drive and
slowly closed in on the winner late in a game effort. J C'S IN TOWN stalked the pace, moved up two wide between rivals near the three eighths pole, raced
from the inside into the upper stretch and kept on to the wire. GOTTATAKEHIMTO was allowed to settle early on, moved up five wide into the upper stretch
to take aim at the leaders and flattened out. MY BOOK raced off the early going, raced four deep past the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly with no
closing run. IT'S A BIRD raced mid pack early on, was four deep near the quarter pole and lacked a rally. CIROC O CLOCK dropped back early, raced
towards the inside and lacked a bid. TIN DELAY was slow early on, raced near the inside and never menaced. GENERAL EISENHOWER showed good
early foot from the inside and stopped.

SY MICHAEL angled in and settled off the early pace, steadily advanced closer through the backstretch and around the far turn, cut the corner entering the
lane, took command near mid-stretch and held sway. TOUCHDOWN JOE stalked the top two leaders through early stages, came under urging four wide
around the far turn, gathered momentum under a drive in the final furlong and cleared second best. JANET'S DEVIL took over the lead soon after the start,
set the pace through the backstretch and held firm around the far turn, got collared by the winner near mid-stretch and weakened to show. JEFFROW
settled through early stages, urged two wide into upper stretch, tipped three wide a furlong out and had a mild improve. SARAH'S VISION raced off the early
pace, saved ground around the far turn, hustled along the inside into the lane and failed to kick on. CPRIORITY prompted the pace through the backstretch,
remained up close through the far turn then gave way. CHARLIES TICKET raced three wide into the first turn and raced off the pace, saved ground into the
lane and failed to respond. YOUR TIME'S COMING lost contact with the field and walked off.

Footnotes
PRIZELESS saved ground through early stages, angled out mid-way around the turn, ranged up into striking distance in upper stretch, given cue three wide
a furlong out, responded willingly and edged away. MEXICAN WONDER BOY was off to a good start and matched strides for the lead with PRADOS
PRIORITY, continued to duel for command into upper stretch, began to edge away on top near the furlong marker then got overtaken by the winner. BLACK
SWORD raced in range three wide around the turn, swung four wide into the lane, came in a couple paths under right handed pressure and ran on for a
share. PRADO'S PRIORITY matched strides for the early lead racing inside of MEXICAN WONDER BOY, dueled into upper stretch then gave way in the
final furlong. SIMPLY WICKED lacked early speed and raced in the back, swung four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. SLITHER raced between
foes in opening stages, chased two wide into the lane and had had no late response. SCARLETTSBLACKJACK showed response in early stages then
came up tired.

MIAS MOONBEAM was allowed to settle in opening stages and sat off the early pace, picked up the tempo four wide with a half mile left to run, ranged up
closer four wide late on the far turn, continued to steadily gain on the top pair through the lane and got up in final strides. HOT LE ROY sat up close three
wide and pressed the embattled top flight, engaged the top pair entering the far turn, dueled for command with HOLLY EMPEROR into the lane, battled into
deep stretch and got denied in final strides. HOLY EMPEROR was off to a good start and angled inside, led the way around the first turn then dueled for the
lead with HOT STOVE LEAGUE up the backstretch, took on the challenge from HOT LE ROY around the far turn, battled for command into the lane, fought
on gamely into deep stretch then yielded nearing the wire. COOL CATOMINE settled along the inside just off midflight, hustled along two wide into upper
stretch and improved position. HOT STOVE LEAGUE angled in two wide soon after the start and sat up close around the first urn, challenged HOLY
EMPEROR for the lead entering the backstretch, dueled into the far turn then tired in the lane. GETCHA positioned four wide settled off the early pace,
failed to kick on when called upon around the far turn and never threatened. HONOR MY SPEED raced off the pace, saved ground and never menaced.
GRAB THE MUNNY raced in contention in early stages then steadily weakened. PARTY OF FIFTEEN failed to move into contention.

Footnotes
SWEET TEMPERAMENT took over a slim lead soon after the start, held a narrow margin around the turn, widened advantage in upper stretch, hustled
along the inside through the lane and just lasted. KELA'S TURN raced two wide in range heading into the turn, shifted a path wider a furlong out, kicked in
gamely and ran out of time. IMA DISCREET LADY raced up close two wide heading into the turn, sustained a steady bid through the lane and ran on for a
share. MISTY DAY hustled along four wide moving through the turn, swung five wide into the lane and gained on show. MY SISTER ANNETTE raced
midpack in opening stages, sustained three wide bid around the turn then flattened in the lane. FIRSTSLATE was forwardly placed in opening stages,
continued in contention along the inside around the turn then gave way. SCARLETT O'HARA was not too far back early on, saved ground around the turn
then came out two to three wide and never responded. ADEN'S RANSOM lacked speed and raced in the back, swung four wide into the lane and never
threatened.

and steadied along the first turn then steadied again in the early backstretch, settled inside up the backstretch, hustled along two wide into the lane and
