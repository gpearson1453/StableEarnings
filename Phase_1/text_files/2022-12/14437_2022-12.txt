Footnotes
IN TRAFFIC angled in while going to the front, showed the way with company to her outside down the backstretch, moved clear at the nine-sixteenths,
raced inside on the turn, was roused outside the five-sixteenths, responded well when put to a left-handed crop in upper stretch, fended off the runner-up
under the crop until outside the sixteenth-pole then held while placed under a strong hand-ride to the wire. RICELLE bumped soundly with a rival at the
start, settled off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, gained under a strong hand-ride passing the half-mile pole, hugged the fence into the turn
then moved to the two path, chased through that bend, pursued the winner under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly for the place while unable to get
by for the victory. ALWAJD was urged along at the rear on the outside, went four wide under strong encouragement on the turn, turned into the stretch
under a drive and earned the show while no match for the top two. TEKILA tossed her head at the start then was bumped soundly on both sides, bumped
with LORDHEARMYPRAYER early, showed speed then tracked the pace on the outside, chased three wide around the turn and tired.
LORDHEARMYPRAYER bumped soundly with foes on both sides at the start, bumped with TEKILA early, settled off the pace, moved closer around the
nine-sixteenths, gained while outside of RICELLE passing the half-mile pole, steadied into the turn and dropped back, came under urging in the two path
around the bend and failed to respond. ABSTRACT MOMENT broke out and bobbled then bumped soundly with an opponent, moved outside the early
leader then advanced to contest the pace on the outside, dropped back near the nine-sixteenths, came up empty while two then three wide around the turn
and retreated then was eased in the stretch but walked off.

Footnotes
KEEN DANCER hustled from the gate, chased three then two wide under urging while detached at the tail of the field, went four to five wide into upper
stretch and tipped out an additional two paths for a clear lane, rallied drifting in despite a left handed crop and quickly seized command inside the eighth
pole from embattled pair up front, then went clear under a light drive before being geared down in the final seventy yards. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH hustled
from the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, proved no match for the top one while
keeping on to secure the place honors. KNOT ANYMORE coaxed from the gate, dueled from the four path with BANKERS DAUGHTER to her outside,
tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued just off the inside for home, dug in clinging to command and
was overhauled in tandem by the top one inside the eighth pole, then weakened to the finish. BANKERS DAUGHTER dueled five paths off the inside with
KNOT ANYMORE to her inside, tucked three wide through the turn and continued to knock heads taking narrow command near the five-sixteenths when
placed to coaxing, spun three wide for home and was headed once more straightened away, continued the duel until overthrown by the eventual winner
inside the eighth pole, then weakened to the wire. TRIPLE P five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired. PREPAREFORTAKEOFF vied briefly from the four path before giving
chase, tucked inside through the turn urged along from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside for home and tired.

Footnotes
BREADMAN settled off the pace, ranged up five wide on the turn, made a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead outside the quarter-pole, shook clear
into upper stretch, extended the advantage under a solid hand-ride into the final furlong, was given one pop of a right-handed crop outside the
sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under a hand-ride from that point to the wire. MIDNIGHT WORKER bumped with a rival at the start, tracked the
pace on the inside, drafted along the rail on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole then put to a drive in upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final
furlong and proved no match while clear for the place. STRONG LIGHT was slowest of the field into stride, moved closer with six furlongs to run, shifted
from three to five wide while roused on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while best of the rest.
GHOSTLYPRINCE was urged early then tracked the leader from the outside, issued a challenge under urging while four then three wide around the turn,
lost touch with the winner into upper stretch and tired. GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS was hustled to the front then went clear early, showed the way down the
backstretch, was asked under threat in the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner outside the quarter-pole and gave way. SIR JOHN bumped
with a rival at the start, settled off the early pace, moved up to make a bid with five furlongs to run, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, chased three
wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and capitulated. KONG LOVES A FIGHT settled at the rear, was roused in the two path on the turn,
spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.

Footnotes
ROYAL POPPY established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing near the
quarter pole before being set down taking the inside route into upper stretch, then drew off under a drive to prevail. LIAM'S CHAMP coaxed from the gate,
chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued three
wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. RISK FREE broke out at the start bumping BALPOOL, chased
along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. BALPOOL a bit
fractious prior to the start, got bumped at the start by RISK FREE, who broke outwards, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. LIGHTBULB MOMENT chased three to four wide until tucked to the two path through the turn,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. SHIRL'S DELIGHT chased just off the inside down
the backstretch and then three to four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, cornered four wide into upper stretch and weakened.
SEAWITCH chased just off the inside under a ride from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, made no impact. PROMISEHER AMERICA
chased five to six wide under coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. PARDON MOI coaxed from the gate, showed brief
speed three wide down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, faded, continued just off the
inside into upper stretch and folded.

Footnotes
AWESOME NATIVE chased the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took the lead in the five path into the stretch and drew clear
under strong urging. FORTUNE'S NEPHEW came inward at the start then bumped with a foe, went clear early and showed the way, went around the turn in
the two path, was asked outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner into the stretch and proved no match while clear for the place.
DREAMPOINT bumped with foes on both sides at the start, dropped back under urging, went three wide around the turn then came four wide into the
stretch and narrowly earned the show. CALLALOO had a shoe repaired in the paddock, bumped with foes just after the start then dropped back before
coming under urging, saved ground for most of the turn then moved to the two path and just missed the show. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF was carried in just
after the start then bumped with opponents, chased the pace down the backstretch, bumped with a foe near the half-mile pole, dropped back into the turn,
moved from the two path to the four path around that bend and tired. TREVOR BARDETTE bumped with rivals on both sides at the start then checked,
moved out then settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and capitulated. CICCIOBELLO was
fractious in the gate, bumped with rivals while carried in just after the start, angled to the outside then was urged along, went four then five wide on the turn,
spun six wide into the stretch and had nothing left. STONECOLDWARRIOR came out at the start then bumped with a foe, lost action against the rail
entering the main track, chased inside a foe while against the rail, bumped with that foe late on the backstretch then dropped back into the turn and
retreated.

Footnotes
CARAMOCHA broke out and hit the gate, was urged along off the pace, moved closer while four then five wide around the turn, came six wide into the
stretch, took the lead near the three-sixteenths, fought outside of the runner-up to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong urging. CARBON chased the
pace on the outside, went three then four wide on the turn, took the lead the five path into the stretch, lost the advantage to the winner around the
three-sixteenths, fought on well with that foe to the finish and just missed while able to get the place. SHADOLAMO dropped in early then moved back
outside, was urged along well off the pace, moved from five to seven wide around the turn, gained outside into upper stretch, chased the top two into the
final furlong and flattened out while well clear for the show. LIBERTY FLAME veered out at the start, contested the pace on the outside of two foes, chased
five then six wide on the turn, dropped back late on that bend, drifted out near the furlong marker and tired. CINDERELLA'S CAUSE disputed the pace on
the inside of two foes, vied along the rail on the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back into upper stretch and capitulated. NEW YORK
BANKER contested the pace between foes, vied in the three path around the turn, dropped back into upper stretch and faded. STEAL MY HEART chased
the pace down the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. SALSA A PARTE was urged
along at the rear, saved ground on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
CELESTIAL MOON vied from the four path among a quartet latched on down the backstretch, advanced in the turn four wide taking command when placed
to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive kept to task. MISTICAL CURLIN vied from the two path
between foes taking over command just inside the half mile pole, showed the way into the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, got displaced
from the front with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to chase the winner home clear of the rest and along second
best. SYSTEMIC CHANGE coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside at the
quarter pole before angling four to five wide into upper stretch, then kicked on belatedly to secure the show honors. VODKA MARDINI four wide in pursuit,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then kept on to preserve the last major
share. MAGICAL WAYS vied three wide between foes under coaxing from the three-eighths, faded through the latter portion of the turn and continued three
wide for home, then weakened in the final furlong. SMOKE AND HEAT chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, angled three wide
into upper stretch, offered no response. OPPORTUNITY SET coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside down the backstretch before going five wide
through the turn under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and weakened. MATT DOYLE broke in a step at the start
bumping and pinching back PREDICTED, chased three then four wide under a ride from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.
HAPPY BOB five wide just off the pace dispute, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. FAZARO vied inside
a trio down the backstretch before yielding the front half a mile from home, retreated through the turn and continued in the inside route into upper stretch
before faltering in the drive. PREDICTED got bumped and forced to steady at the start when pinched back due to pressure from MATT DOYLE breaking
inwards, chased three wide down the backstretch and then five to six wide through the turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and made no impact.
