Footnotes
BLETCHLEY PARK stalked outside a rival then raced three deep outside the leader, challenged three deep then two wide between rivals on the far turn,
took over leaving the bend, bumped with PRINCIP in midstretch and held off challengers on both sides to the wire. PURIFIED broke out and bumped rival,
chased two wide into the first turn then suffered a mild shuffle between rivals to lose some ground, tracked two then three wide on the second bend, put in a
late bid outside the top trio and got up for second. PALAGIO broke a step slow, chased four then three wide early, bid four deep on the far turn and three
deep into the stretch, battled into the final sixteenth and never found the needed final kick. PRINCIP chased on the inside then moved out and drew alonside
the leader into the backstretch, lost touch then went up to apply pressure again between rivals, took over at the five-sixteenths pole, lost command leaving
the far turn, fought back from inside and bumped with BLETCHLEY PARK midstretch and stayed on well to the line. MASTERMIND cleared early and
angled from the four path down to the inside on the clubhouse turn, gained company in the middle stages, dueled into the far turn then lost command at the
five-sixteenths pole, could not keep up with the leaders leaving the bend, tired in the drive and was eased and walked off. MIGRATION trailed two to three
wide early, pulled up at the half-mile pole, stopped on the far turn and walked into the van under his own power.

DICEY MO CHARA (GB) bumped then got sandwiched between rivals at the start, settled on the inside, was in range entering the far turn, tipped out and
took aim two wide into stretch, bid four deep at the eighth pole, took over nearing the sixteenth marker and held gamely over FLASHIEST in the final
moments. FLASHIEST unhurried in the early going and moved into the two path, eased out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, closed well
from outside but was too late. MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS bobbled and bumped a few times at the start, pulled early chasing the behind the leader on the
inside, moved out and pulled the rider along to the front to duel outside BOB AND JACKIE, battled around the far turn and into the stretch, held a short lead
entering the final furlong, relinquished the lead outside the sixteenth pole and flattened to third. PRINCE ABAMA (IRE) stalked in the two path, angled to the
rail past the quarter pole, bid between foes at the eighth pole but lost his path midstretch, tipped out and finished willingly for a minor award. BOB AND
JACKIE veered in and bumped rival in the beginning, went up to duel from outside then inside MASTEROFFOXHOUNDS up the backstretch, fought into
and around the far turn, stayed on to midstretch, then flattened in the final sixteenth. GO ON stumbled badly in the beginning, reserved at the back in the
early going, trailed on the inside into the stretch, moved out in the lane and finished willingly while unable to threaten. RIP CITY shifted out and brushed rival
at the start, showed early speed along the inside dueling for command then dropped back a bit to stalk, tipped three wide while asked on the far turn and
faded through the drive.

Footnotes
FAUSTIN got shuffled between early, chased under coaxing early, went two wide into the turn, gained through the turn and angled out from behind the
leaders leaving the bend, drew alongside SONORAN in midstretch, took over near the sixteenth pole and kicked clear to win going away. SONORAN
stalked the top pair to the turn, engaged the leaders from outside and took over four wide entering the lane, cleared briefly in upper stretch then received the
challenge from FAUSTIN, could not offer much resistance and relinquished the lead outside the sixteenth pole and stayed for a clear second. YELLOW
BRICK dropped back off the pace early, raced on the inside then moved off the fence around the turn, swung out into the stretch and got up for the show.
WORCESTER raced near the back outside a rival into the turn, moved down to the two path on the bend then spun three wide into the stretch, summoned a
mild rally but missed the show. VEGAS BURNER dueled for command from outside into and around the turn, could keep up with SONORAN in upper
stretch and weakened in the late stages. QUINCY MARKET trailed off the rail into the turn, angled in around the bend, passed tiring rivals in the drive but
failed to menace. BLUEGRASS GO GO tracked three wide into the turn, entered the stretch four wide and weakened. JAM SESSION dueled for command
inside VEGAS BURNER, fought through the bend and into the stretch, could not kick on with the leader in upper stretch and faded out of contention.

Footnotes
SMART CODE sat off the pace outside a rival, moved closer outside foes into the far turn, rallied four then three deep around the bend, took over in upper
stretch, drifted in while battling with ESCAPE ARTIST and gamely prevailed. ESCAPE ARTIST vied three deep then cleared around the first turn and moved
inward, took some pressure into the second bend, vied with outside rivals around the bend and into the stretch, lost the lead in upper stretch but fought back
from inside and stayed on to the wire. DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) got bumped on both sides shortly after the start, was reserved in the early going in the
two path into the first turn, moved closer between rivals in the middle stages, spun four wide into the stretch and finished willingly to earn the show honors.
MALTESE FALCON (IRE) broke a bit slow then got bumped hard at the start, raced on the inside near the back then had to steady on the first turn, raced
between into the second bend then eased out to the three path and summoned a mild rally to round out the superfecta. HAWKER vied between early then
moved back to stalk and went to the inside, roused with a quarter mile left to run, moved off the rail and lacked a late bid. LOW EXPECTATIONS was
fractious loading in the gate, stalked outside a rival early on, applied pressure into the far turn, fought between foes into the stretch and flattened in the final
furlong. ZIO JO broke in and brushed rival, traveled three wide into the first turn, moved closer five deep in the middle stages, came four wide into the
stretch and failed to threaten. COSMIC SOUL vied for the lead on the inside then ceded command nearing the first turn, pulled some early, stalked two wide
into the second bend, found some traffic on the far turn then angled in leaving the bend and could not rally. SECRET TREASURE tracked on the inside to
the stretch and failed to rally. GLENDALE lugged in and bumped rivals shortly after the start, trailed to the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and failed to
menace. ZIHUATANEJO was a bit green in the two path early on the first turn, moved closer three wide up the backstretch, continued in the three path into
the lane and weakened. DARYL'S BOLT brushed from outer rival at the start, raced off the pace in the two path into the first turn, steadied late on the that
bend, went three wide around the far turn and had little left for the stretch run.

Footnotes
COUNTRY GRAMMER stalked in the four path early, bid three deep into the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, cleared under right handed urging
leaving the bend, switched to the left hand in upper stretch and drew off. STILLETO BOY pressed the pacesetter from outside, gained command at the
five-sixteenths pole, lost the lead with a quarter mile left to run, chased COUNTRY GRAMMER into the stretch and kept on to secure second. HEYWOODS
BEACH bumped with HUDSON RIDGE in the beginning, raced outside a rival at the back early, coaxed between rivals on the far turn, two wide into the
stretch and gained the show honors. BREAKFAST RIDE stalked in the three path early on, chased three deep on the far turn, three wide leaving the bend
and lacked a late bid. HUDSON RIDGE bumped with HEYWOODS BEACH at the start, tucked to the rail racing inside that rival at the back, saved ground
to the stretch and failed to threaten. HOPKINS set the pace from inside while under pressure from STILLETO BOY, was overtaken at the five-sixteenths
pole, started to weaken leaving the far turn and faded down the lane.

Footnotes
LA DEUXIEME ETOILE dueled for the lead early from outside then cleared rival entering the turn, crossed over to the inside, moved off the rail into the
stretch, continued clear into the final sixteenth and held well. TRUE PATRIOT bumped leaving the gate, raced near the back off the rail, came three wide
into the lane, angled widest in the drive and finished with a late rush but could not get by the winner. DANCING DANA stalked four wide into the turn, moved
to the three path then came back out into the stretch, chased within range through the final furlong but failed to summon the needed late kick. ELEUTHERA
chased between rivals then got bumped and put in tight having to check early, came out and bumped rival crossing the dirt, bumped with inner rival in upper
stretch, steered to the inside of the leader in the lane but faltered late. FLAME MCGOON pulled a bit chasing the leaders early, went two wide into the turn,
got bumped from inside and floated out crossing the dirt, then finished evenly in the final furlong. BIG BEAUTY bumped inner rival at the start, chased three
deep then five wide into the lane and lacked the needed late punch in the stretch run. D'S LOVELY SOPHIA dueled from inside early then chased the leader
into the turn, came out and bumped rival in upper stretch and could not rally in the drive. LADY MARYANN got sandwiched between rivals in the beginning,
tracked two wide to the stretch, moved out in the lane and also lacked a rally. STARSHIP SKY got bumped back leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack down
the hill, spun three wide into the drive and failed to menace. BIG SHAMROCK veered out and bumped rival leaving the gate, got bothered by steadying rival
into the turn, traveled two wide around the bend and was not a factor. SMILING MOLLY bumped with outer rival early, stalked between foes then three wide
into the lane and weakened. PIAZZETTA got bumped on both sides at the start, chased on the inside into the bend then got squeezed by outer rival and
checked hard early on the bend, saved ground to the stretch and could not rally.

FUN TO DREAM chased early then went up to press the top pair from outside, challenged three deep then dueled from outside past the five-sixteenths
pole, moved clear in upper stretch and held well in the closing moments. AWAKE AT MIDNYTE stalked four deep early on, moved in on the turn and chased
two wide into the drive, tipped out and took aim at FUN TO DREAM in the stretch, finished willingly from outside in the final sixteenth but could not get by.
KIRSTENBOSCH lacked early speed, trailed three wide into the stretch, angled out and got up for the show. MIDNIGHT MEMORIES forwardly placed in the
early going, traveled three then four wide around the bend and got outkicked by KIRSTENBOSCH for third. GANADORA went up to duel for command from
inside, failed to keep up with the outside pair approaching the quarter pole and flattened down the lane. AIN'T EASY dueled for the lead outside
GANADORA early, vied between foes on the turn then dueled inside FUN TO DREAM past the five-sixteenths pole, lost contact with that rival in upper
stretch and weakened inside the furlong grounds. UNDER THE STARS stalked the pace on the inside, tipped two wide into the stretch and faded.

the leader in the two path, applied pressure on the backstretch, took over in upper stretch, cleared briefly with a sixteenth remaining and got run down by the
winner in the closing moments. SPARKLE BLUE drifted out and bumped rival shortly after the start then came out again and bumped rival crossing the dirt,
was keen early chasing behind the leader first time through the stretch, drifted out and bumped rival at the quarter pole on the final turn, then finished
willingly down the lane for the show honors. OAKHURST got bumped and put in tight quarters in the beginning, angled inward then settled in the two path,
traveled between rivals, tipped three wide into the lane, angled out in the stretch, closed well and missed third. SKIMS (GB) took a bump shortly after the
start, angled into the two path then moved inside, traveled between foes into the backstretch, remained between rivals on the far turn and got bumped from
inside at the quarter pole, chased within striking distance entering the final furlong but lost his path late. PIZZA BIANCA steered inward while trailing early,
saved ground to the stretch, altered out in upper stretch, altered out twice more from behind a rival and kept on to improve position. SALIMAH (IRE) sprinted
to the front and crossed over, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch, maintained a short lead leaving the far turn, lost command in upper stretch
and weakened in the final sixteenth. DUVET DAY (IRE) unhurried four wide entering the stretch for the first time, traveled three deep at the back into the

BELLSTREET BRIDIE (GB) got bumped on both sides shortly after the start then got floated out and bumped rival crossing the dirt, dropped back off the
pace, went three to four wide around the first turn, entered the stretch five wide and had little left for the drive. THE RIDER ABOARD SKIMS (GB) LODGED
AN OBJECTION AGAINST SCHOOL DANCE ALLEGING INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH. FOLLOWING A REVIEW, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT
ALTHOUGH SCHOOL DANCE DID DRIFT OUT IT DID NOT COST SKIMS (GB) A CHANCE AT A BETTER PLACING.
