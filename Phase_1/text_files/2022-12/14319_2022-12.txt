Footnotes
KEEN RESPONSE angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking just off the leaders into the backstretch, gained position along the rail on the far
turn, tipped out entering upper stretch while being roused to terms with the pacesetter, dueled with that one past midstretch in a protracted skirmish while
being floated out exchanging light contact but edged forward in time under firm encouragement. KING ZION was urged to the lead along the inside dictating
the pace on a narrow advantage to the far turn, shifted out racing through the stretch while being prompted to resist the winner's bid with a grudging effort
brushing that foe but just failed to contain that rival. BON DEUX, urged to a forward placing racing just outside the pacesetter to the backstretch, then to the
far turn, gave way into the lane. UNCLE DICK hopped at the start, was settled last racing well off the leaders to the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch but
passed only tiring foes. MORANT broke inwards bumping KING ZION, was reserved off the second flight along the inside to the backstretch, tipped out
nearing the lane but offered no rally. MEMPHIS THEPROPHET was urged to a position outside a rival racing as part of the second flight to the far turn and
gave way nearing the lane.

Footnotes
HARD LIKE HOLLY ducked inwards at the start while breaking slowly, settled between foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, continued under
patient handling into the far turn, angled out five wide racing into upper stretch gradually gaining striking distance and prevailed in time under firm handling.
ASKEW, urged to a forward placing along the inside while conceding the lead into the first turn, tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking distance on
the backstretch, shifted out advancing on that foe to bid for command three deep between foes nearing midstretch, held a narrow advantage late but
couldn't fend off the winner. BEZEL SET broke outwards bumping SEQUAYA, was reserved near the inside to the backstretch, shifted outside foes racing
through the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch but continued with interest to gain position to the end while earning a share. CAIRO SUMMER,
urged to a forward placing three deep racing to the backstretch, conceded some position in that path racing into the far turn, raced four wide into upper
stretch, then shifted inwards in the closing stages finishing with an even effort between foes to gain some position nearing the wire. SENORITA AURORA
angled to the inside tracking the leaders from out of striking distance racing to the far turn, saved ground to upper stretch gradually gaining contention near
midstretch but had no final bid. SHE'S XTREMELY HOT settled between foes to the backstretch, was prompted to advance racing into the far turn, shifted
out four wide in upper stretch while being prompted to lodge a brief bid between foes midstretch but flattened out. SHE TAKES FLIGHT was urged forcing
the pace outside a rival racing into the first turn, went clear while angling to the inside entering the backstretch under prompting, held sway on a comfortable
margin into the far turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch and gave out once headed leaving the furlong marker. SEQUAYA, bumped at the start,
switched outside foes while dropping out last racing five deep to the backstretch and dropped out early.

Footnotes
HOT DAME was urged along the inside setting the pace on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, held sway racing into the far turn, drifted out while
widening the advantage midstretch and continued in the five path while maintaining a clear advantage to the end under pressure. ON A TOUR settled last
racing to the first turn while angling to the inside nearing the backstretch, saved ground throughout and continued with a steady advance inside foes racing
into upper stretch to prove best of the others. WAY TOO SMARTE, restless in the gate before the start, angled to the inside racing to the first turn tracking
just off the first flight to the backstretch, was prompted to advance nearing the far turn, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch to race in the four path
in the lane, shifted about under pressure in the closing stages but lacked the needed final kick while prevailing for a share. STACK SHACK, forwardly placed
three deep from the outset, prompted the leaders in that path racing to the far turn and gave way into upper stretch. ROYA was urged between foes
prompting the pacesetter from the outset to the far turn, then gave way into upper stretch. SHE'S A BIG STAR, caught four wide racing through the first turn
tracking just off the first flight, continued in that path into the second bend and emptied out into the lane.

Footnotes
RACEDAY ATTIRE broke readily, was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage through the backstretch, forged clear midway through
the bend, held sway into upper stretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure. IT'S GREEK TO ME broke readily, prompted the pace three deep
through the backstretch, shifted out to the four path nearing upper stretch while being being urged to advance on the pacesetter and proved best of the
others. SWEET FRAULEIN, off a step slowly, settled last in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing into the turn, saved ground to upper stretch and
continued with an effort to gain position to the end while prevailing for a share. MUD HUT, restless in the gate prior to the start, was urged between foes
prompting the pacesetter into the turn, then faded into upper stretch. HALLIE'S RAINBOW stumbled at the start, was righted quickly, angled to the rail
tracking just off the leaders racing into the bend, was prompted to gain position nearing upper stretch, tipped off the inside entering the lane and emptied out
midstretch. SUMMER BELLE settled outside foes in the opening stages, raced four wide into the turn, was fanned to the five path nearing upper stretch and
offered no rally. RUNNERS HEAT was rated between foes tracking off the first flight in the opening stages but retreated early.

Footnotes
KIMBERLY FRANCES, off a step slowly, settled last to the backstretch, shifted outside foes nearing the far turn, advanced four wide through the second
bend to upper stretch and rallied to the front in time under firm encouragement. BOWS N LACE was rated tracking just off the first flight along the inside to
the backstretch, came through along the rail to challenge for command when presented an opening in upper stretch, gained the advantage between foes but
couldn't contain the winner. WEEKEND PASS settled along the inside racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch to
split rivals three deep in the closing stages, then shifted outside the leaders nearing the wire to prevail for a share. AUNT STELLA was urged to terms
prompting the pacesetter racing into the first turn, conceded some position tracking that rival on the backstretch, continued with a steady bid into the lane to
challenge three deep between foes but weakened in late stages. DAIGLE was urged along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the
backstretch, tipped out nearing the lane to duel between foes into upper stretch and gave out leaving the furlong marker. LINDALOUIMAGE tracked off the
second flight outside foes to the backstretch, was fanned five wide into the lane but offered no rally. WATCHIN THE WHEELS tracked just off the leaders
outside a rival in second flight in the opening half, shifted out three wide on the far turn while being prompted to advance but steadily faded in the drive.
SILVERA angled to the inside racing into the first turn tracking off the second flight to the backstretch but retreated between rivals after a half.

Footnotes
DANVILLE chased the leading pair inside of ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS, was nudged along while chasing the leading pair around the far turn in the four
path, drifted out in upper stretch but nonetheless mustered a rally under a drive, found his best in the final furlong, and caught the leader from the outside
just in time. LAVENDER EARL was sent between horses, took brief pressure from IWILLPERSEVERE early but cleared into the first turn, continued well
clear of the pack down the backstretch and while saving ground around the far turn, was pushed along in upper stretch and driven approaching the furlong
pole, ran on while drifting out late but was nailed in the last jumps. COWBOYS DREAM settled near the rear, was pushed along down the backstretch but
remained near the rear, began to improve while saving ground on the far turn, came into the lane inside, and ran on with good interest to the wire while
proving best of the rest. IWILLPERSEVERE prompted the early pace outside of LAVENDER EARL but let that one clear into the turn, tracked well behind
that foe, raced in the three path on the far turn while still tracking far behind the leader, came into the lane five wide and was driven between horses, could
not reel in the pacesetter and ran on only evenly. IRISH DECLARATION settled at the rear, began to take slightly closer order approaching the far turn,
raced in the two path on the far turn, swung four wide into the lane and passed tiring horses. DYNABLUE chased between horses on the first turn, settled
toward the rear into the back straight, raced in the three path with the rear flight on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and mustered no bid.
ANDTHETHUNDERROLLS chased three wide on the first turn, continued to chase outside of DANVILLE down the back straight, raced in the five path on
the far turn and went to a drive past the three eighths, but had no response.

Footnotes
GAME BOY BENNY prompted the pace outside of REDNECKERTHANYOU early, tracked three wide on the turn, was driven in the five path into the lane,
vied at the outside of the leading flight, drove to the lead near the sixteenth and cleared late. SWISHAWISH chased inside of HURTS SO BAD down the
back straight at the rear of a close-knit main pack, was a bit keen approaching the half, chased in the two path on the turn, shifted inside of LAKE MILLS in
upper stretch and rallied under a drive, briefly poked his head in front past the furlong mark, but was outfinished in the final sixteenth by GAME BOY
BENNY. LAKE MILLS tracked the leading pair in the pocket, continued to hug the rail behind the leader around the turn, was driven inside horses into the
lane and responded with a rally, took the lead inside of REDNECKERTHANYOU in upper stretch, drifted out approaching midstretch, continued to lead
between horses until being headed near the sixteenth mark and flattened out late. REDNECKERTHANYOU showed pace inside foes, made the running in
the two to three path on the turn, came into the lane in the four path, was headed from the inside in upper stretch by LAKE MILLS and then carried out by
that foe approaching midstretch, and flattened out in the final furlong. BEEALEA soon trailed, raced in the three to four path on the turn, was driven into the
lane still in the three to four path, passed some tiring horses in upper stretch but ultimately lacked the needed late kick. FOLLOW THE SIGNS attended
outside the leading pair early, settled back to midfield into the turn, steadied behind traffic past the three eighths, shifted out to the four path, came into the
lane in the five path, found no rally under a drive and flattened late. HURTS SO BAD chased outside of SWISHAWISH down the back straight at the rear of
a compact main field, made a bid in the five path on the turn, was in range near the five sixteenths, floated out int o the lane in the six to seven path and
emptied out.

Footnotes
BLOOMING GARDEN was sent hard between horses early, cleared into the first turn, continued on a defined lead down the back straight and in the two
path on the far turn, was pushed along in upper stretch and began to draw away, went to a drive approaching the furlong mark, and maintained an
insurmountable advantage while kept to the task until the final few strides. FUTURE VISION tracked between horses, was urged between horses in the
tracking flight on the far turn, came three wide into the lane, proved no match for BLOOMING GARDEN, but chased on down the lane and held off RIP IT
RYAN to hold place. RIP IT RYAN was reluctant to load, raced three wide into the first turn, settled at the rear, began to take mildly closer order down the
back straight, rallied four wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane, sustained his run outside foes and narrowly missed the place. TEA AFTER
BALLET raced at the inside of the tracking flight, continued to save ground inside foes around the far turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, proved no
match for BLOOMING GARDEN, chased in tandem with FUTURE VISION to midstretch but flattened in the final furlong. DARE GOES DA DEVIL chased
while positioned four wide on the first turn, continued to chase well behind the tracking flight down the back straight, was joined inside by STUN GUN and
outside by MADELYNS HEAT approaching the far turn, came in on STUN GUN near the seven sixteenths, edged closer to the leading group between
horses on the far turn, came three wide into the lane and kept on mildly. CAPTAIN CARNEGIE tracked the pace three wide, came four wide into the lane,
and flattened in the final furlong. STUN GUN settled inside near the rear, inched forward inside of OFF TO THE BEACH past the five eighths, joined inside
of DARE GOES DA DEVIL into the turn, took up near the seven sixteenths inside of DARE GOES DA DEVIL, saved ground around the far turn, was driven
inside in upper stretch, offered a mild bid but was outfinished late. MADELYNS HEAT was fractious in the gate, settled toward the rear, chased outside of
OFF TO THE BEACH down the back straight, joined outside DARE GOES DA DEVIL into the turn and edged closer three wide, came into the lane three
wide and emptied out. OFF TO THE BEACH chased behind DARE GOES DA DEVIL early, chased between horses near the rear approaching the far turn,
was outpaced in the three path on the far turn and had no more in the lane.
