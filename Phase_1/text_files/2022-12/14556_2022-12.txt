hustled along, split horses on the turn but was not enough late. COLD AS YOU was void of the early speed then moved up on the turn from two wide and
made a late rally. TENSAS VIRGINIA dueled for the lead from the five path and finished evenly. I'M ALL MIXED UP dueled for the lead from the inside and
gave way grudgingly. CUSTOM GUITAR was close up in the three path, dropped back and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH was

FLASHY MEG dueled for the lead from the two path to the quarter pole and drew off. SHELLEY'S MONEY was within striking distance, went three wide in
upper stretch to prove second best. JACKIES IRISHDREAM bumped with ROLL BABY at the start, was close up down the backstretch then moved up from
two wide in upper stretch and faltered. LA TRESS GRAY was forwardly placed while racing four wide and lacked a late response. MISCHIEVOUS DIANE
was not a threat. ROLL BABY bumped with JACKIES IRISHDREAM at the start and was void of early speed, passed tiring rivals in the stretch. MISS JAMIE
went to a clear early lead then dueled for the lead to the quarter pole and tired.

Footnotes
EILEEN ALEXANDRA settled in the middle of the pack from the two path to the final turn then moved out to three wide to rally, wore down the leader late in
the stretch drive to be up in the final strides. FINAL QUEST was placed off the pace in the three path down the backstretch then moved out to four wide on
the final turn to take the lead at the quarter pole and inched away to take a clear lead into the stretch but was nailed at the wire. MISHPACHAH was
forwardly placed on the inside and slipped up the rail on the backstretch to take the lead at the seven sixteenths pole then was headed at the quarter pole
and gave way grudgingly. SPIRITED BEAUTY was unhurried early, went four wide into the first turn, settled near the back on the backstretch, made a three
wide move on the final turn to make a late rally and improved her position. OUR LITTLE GIRL raced near the back from the three path, never made a
serious bid and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. UNIFIED LOVE saved ground while racing in the middle of the pack then moved out to three wide in upper
stretch but failed to menace. COURTLY DOC pressed the pace to the five sixteenths pole from the two path and gave way. LUTIE MO sprinted to the lead
from the inside then vied for the lead to the five sixteenths pole and retreated. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX was allowed to settle in the middle of the pack but
was never a threat.

Footnotes
THE FIVE B'S sprinted to a clear lead then floated out in upper stretch but was kept to task in the stretch to prove best. MORO OUTLAW chased the
leaders down the backstretch then made a bid on the turn moved out to three to four wide in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. TALK TO
TOKEY bumped with CALL ME FIREY at the start then tracked the leaders from the inside and was best of the rest. FLASHY BOY GOES bobbled at the
start and was void of early speed, made a rail bid on the turn but flattened out. COUNTRY CAT JAKE was within striking distance in the three path but failed
to menace. CALL ME FIREY bumped with TALK TO TOKEY at the start, was void of speed and was never a threat. ALWAYS LOGAN was outrun.
