Footnotes
LANDON JACK accelerated to the early lead, remained well off the inner rail throughout and was under some urging late. SEVEN'S ELEVEN hugged the
inner rail throughout and gamely chased the winner to the wire. PRIDE OF PAYTON bobbled break, saved ground on the turn, remained inside horses in
the stretch and passed tired ones. DUCKPINS , four deep entering the turn, circled foes and failed to rally. SNACK raced in the two path between horses
around the turn and weakened. CALIFORNIA GHOST broke alertly and dropped back early.

Footnotes
ON THE ENGINE , coaxed along off the rail and not too far off of a contested pace, edged up behind foes then steadied and waited near the quarter pole,
found a seam to work through in mid stretch, sustained under left handed asking to close outside rivals, took over late and edged clear. ARISTOCAT got
into a battle outside STAR SHOPPING soon after the break, carried that duel while holding a slim lead under pressure past mid stretch, kept on well and
was clear for the place. STAR SHOPPING , put into the race early, sparred inside ARISTOCAT, was under heavy pressure around the turn, kept on to
about the sixteenth marker then gave way grudgingly. IMAGINE IT ALL , off the early pace, rushed up four to five wide to reach contention mid turn, chased
from the quarter pole then flattened out late. RESILIENT COURAGE lacked speed, swung well wide in upper stretch and had belated action.
QUINCANNON was used hard inside while moving to a forward spot early on, stayed in touch to mid turn then faded. DR RAGS tracked the dueling leaders
three wide, failed to kick on under a ride in mid stretch and gave way. LOVE MACHINE failed to menace. DESPITE ODDS saved ground early and faded.

Footnotes
COFFEEWITHCHRIS was urged clear soon after the start, dropped down a bit then was engaged and headed from the inside by FULL MOON MADNESS,
rated kindly outside that one during the run into the turn, moved to apply more pressure leaving the three eighths, took over when put to firmer asking into
the lane, wandered outward a bit soon after, spurted clear turned away an outside threat from PRINCE OF JERICHO in mid stretch and widened while kept
to task. PRINCE OF JERICHO tracked a contested pace while off the rail, came under a ride mid turn, edged up three to four wide in upper stretch, had
sights set on the winner with a furlong to go but failed to follow through. RICCIO settled in the clear, edged up three wide into the turn, chased and kept on
with some interest while passing a tiring rival for the show. FULL MOON MADNESS was hard sent leaving the chute and bid inside the winner to take a slim
lead, handled outside pressure, dueled from the three eighths to the quarter pole, failed to go on under asking in mid stretch and weakened through the final
sixteenths. ALOTTACENTS broke a step slow, raced well back, saved ground into the lane and lacked a bid. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE stalked the early pace
while saving ground, was under a solid ride past the three eighths, angled out when failing to kick on and tired through the drive.

Footnotes
MALIBU MOONSHINE lacked speed, found room along the inner rail through the stretch, took command inside STONEWALL STAR in deep stretch and
drove clear. GIVE ME KISSES , under urging between horses on the turn, chased the pace, remained between foes in the stretch and was up for the place
at the finish. STONEWALL STAR bore in leaving the starting gate, sped to the early lead, set the pace, was well off the inner rail in the stretch and
weakened late. GORMLEY'S GABRIELA saved ground on the turn, swung to the four path in upper stretch, remained on her left lead and gained late. MISS
GEORGIE failed to keep pace on the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and was not a late factor. OJITOS BELLOS , bumped leaving the starting
gate, was outrun. TAPPIN JOSIE , bumped leaving the starting gate, circled the turn four wide, drifted out entering the stretch, gave way and was eased
late.

Footnotes
DIAMONDSIFYOUDO prompted the pace three wide outside the leader, moved to apply more pressure leaving the far turn, was floated out a path dueling
into the lane, poked a head in front soon after, shifted in a couple paths while continuing the battle through the final furlong and held firm under left handed
asks. PRINCESS CAIRO took over between runners into the first turn, set a rated pace in the two path while handling pressure from both sides, was guided
three wide while emerging in a duel with the winner entering the lane, was forced in towards the rail near mid stretch, fought valiantly in tight quarters and
missed in a sharp debut. CYNERGY'S ELECTRA , three wide, steadily advanced leaving the five sixteenths, chased from upper stretch and churned on to
nab the show in the final jumps. CREOLE lost ground four wide stalking the pace, edged a bit closer leaving the far turn, was under a firm ride pursuing past
the five sixteenths, shifted in towards the rail near the three sixteenths and faded late. TITIAN TYRANT prompted the pace along the rail to the far turn,
failed to kick on leaving the three eighths and steadily gave way. DIAMOND SUE steadied off heels around the first turn, was urged inside nearing the half
mile marker, dropped back, angled out and came up empty. GOLD DIGGING BROAD , four wide early, was not a factor. DETERMINED LILLY broke a bit
slowly, raced off the pace and three wide past the five eighths, angled wider for the drive but failed to seriously respond. BRIGHT MOON broke slowly, was
steadied along off rivals heels around the first turn and gave way. IRISH ZAPPER , two wide stalking the early pace, faltered leaving the far turn. An
objection by the rider of PRINCESS CAIRO against the winner for alleged interference in the stretch was not allowed.

SWAYIN TO AND FRO hugged the inner rail disputing the pace then asserted herself the final furlong, drawing away under steady handling.
DONTLETSWEETFOOLYA disputed the pace outside the winner, failed to keep up the final furlong but clear held the place. FOUETTE chased the pace
around the turn, was three wide entering the stretch and weakened. FILLE D'ESPRIT lacked speed, was near the inner rail entering the turn, swung to the
four path leaving the bend and weakened in the drive. JUROR NUMBER FOUR , no factor, saved ground around the turn. MOVIE MOXY bobbled slightly at
the break, drifted very wide entering the stretch and was eased. FLASHY CHARGE was outrun.

Footnotes
FACTOR IT IN broke sharply and took the initiative, set a rated pace early on while handling some pressure from both sides, dropped in towards the rail
entering the turn, remained under confident handling with a trio to his outside past the five sixteenths, was guided out to about the two path soon after,
spurted clear after being roused into the lane, kept on under right handed asking leaving mid stretch and proved resolute to the wire. BEREN bobbled
inward at the break and was away last, regrouped and rushed up to the inside of the winner to prompt, steadied out of tight quarters nearing the turn,
recovered to make an inside run leaving the five sixteenths, came out and took aim into the lane, altered back in leaving mid stretch and kept on gamely
though unable to seriously threaten the winner through the final seventy yards. SAVOY drafted well back early, saved ground into and through the lane and
closed steadily. KARAN'S NOTION flashed speed then dropped back under coaxing heading to the turn, eased out for the drive and offered a mild
response. DIVINE LEADER , four and three wide between rivals, prompted the pace to the head of the lane then faded. KENNY HAD A NOTION , five wide
in range and outside rivals nearing the half mile marker, remained well wide into the lane, lacked a punch past the three sixteenths and weakened. JAXON
TRAVELER , three and two wide between rivals, pressed the pace to the top of the stretch then retreated. SHOWTIME CAT drifted out at the break,
corrected to pursue outside a rival then faltered in upper stretch.

MALIBU BEAUTY , right to the early lead, set the pace near the inner rail, edged away in upper stretch, was put to urging late and eagerly increased her
advantage. COVER VERSION was not a factor early, circled foes three wide the far turn and rallied. HYBRID ECLIPSE , three wide the first turn, advanced
outside horses leaving the backstretch, pressed the pace outside the winner on the far turn and tired in the drive. RUNAWAY MONET failed to keep pace on
the far turn, swung wide in upper stretch and passed a tired foe late. BERATE , four wide the first turn, had a mild advanced on the far turn, raced along the
inner rail in the stretch and weakened. CHAMPAGNE TOAST raced inside horses, chased the pace to the far turn and faltered. GO BIG BLUE NATION ,
outrun was eased. OUT OF SORTS bobbled slightly at the break, raced inside horses, faltered on the far turn and was eased.

Footnotes
NIMITZ CLASS , in range three wide, took closer order behind rivals leaving the far turn, shifted out and saw the engaged leaders get away a bit nearing the
lane, leveled off under left handed asking near mid stretch, kept on determinedly and forged ahead to the outside of AIN'T DA BEER COLD in the final
yards. AIN'T DA BEER COLD prompted the pace three wide, moved up and bid three deep after a half mile, dueled on a slim lead leaving the three eighths
pole, clung to command under a drive and to the outside of OURNATIONONPARADE near mid stretch, kept on gamely but just failed to hold.
OURNATIONONPARADE attended the pace inside, battled inside a pair of rivals from the half mile marker to the five sixteenths, stayed on to duel with
AIN'T DA BEER COLD to mid stretch then weakened late. PLOT THE DOTS , bumped at the break, raced under a firm hold early, saved ground leaving the
far turn, angled four wide for the drive but failed to drum up the needed kick. ARMANDO R drifted out at the break and bumped with a rival, lagged well
back, swung six wide under pressure for the drive but lacked a rally. AMERICAN D'ORO , bumped and pinched back at the break, regrouped to edge up
some around the first turn, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and came up empty. WORKIN ON A DREAM sped to the front while two wide, was
hounded from both sides past the five eighths, held a short lead into the far turn, failed to go on with the leaders leaving the five sixteenths and faltered.
