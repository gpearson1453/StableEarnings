Footnotes
SOUPER QUEST set the pace in the two path, drew off while drifting out a bit in the lane, switched back to the left lead and shifted in briefly when urged
right-handed once near the sixteenth pole, switched back to the right lead soon after and widened under hand urging while again drifting out through the
final sixteenth. CERTAIN was bumped soon after the start, stalked the pace from the rail, was no match for the winner but stayed on willingly to be clearly
second best. BOY O' BOY raced off the pace two wide and was along for the show. ISLAND SWAGGER came in and bumped CERTAIN at the start,
chased the pace three wide and weakened in the lane. SMOKIN CLOUD checked when CERTAIN was bumped inward into his path not long after the start,
raced three wide and never threatened. POKER NITE AT TOMS played no factor while racing two wide. SOLOMONS GOLD was outrun while racing two
wide. DARKDESERTHIGHWAY chased the pace two wide and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
FROSTED ARMOUR set the pace from inside, was roused entering the lane, dug in when headed by HIGH YIELD KITTEN entering the final furlong, and
held gamely. HIGH YIELD KITTEN rated from the three path into the turn, ranged up to take aim from the four path turning into the stretch, bid for the lead
from the three path into the final furlong, but hung late to place. APPRAISAL chased from inside, cut the corner turning into the lane, drifted out through the
stretch, and finished evenly to show. BRASSTOWN was bumped between rivals at the start, prompted the pace in the three path, floated out to the six path
turning into the stretch, but flattened. BRACCIO DI FERRO broke out at the start bothering an outer rival, trailed along the inside into the turn, was ridden
along while swinging out to the seven path entering the lane, and was no threat. UNTITLED broke out and bumped an outer foe, stalked from the the two
path to the half mile marker, but backed up rounding the turn.

the turn, bid three wide nearing the quarter pole, dueled two wide through most of the stretch, won that battle but could not hold off the top two late.
GRANDE SOIREE dueled two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch, continued on the left lead, vied to deep stretch and weakened late. ROYAL QUALITY
dueled inside, steadied near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and tired. COVERT KAT chased the pace in the five path, drifted wider

Footnotes
FEAST was sent to the lead from the two path, was coaxed midway around the turn, and held on gamely in the stretch to win. NO ANGEL rated from inside,
was roused while tipping out to the six path turning into the stretch, and ran on for place. UNCLE B stalked along the inside, cut the corner under a drive
turning into the lane, but finished evenly to show. CITY DRIFTER tracked in the four path but was one paced in the stretch. GUILDSMAN (FR) trailed from
the three path into the stretch and was never a factor. SMOKY BLUES prompted the pace from the three path, was cued to bid around the turn, but faded in
the stretch. SO STREET brushed with an inner rival out of the gate, chased from the five path but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
MY SEA COTTAGE (IRE) set the pace along the rail, drew off around the far turn and widened through the lane while ridden out. WORLDS ON HIGH
settled off the pace while racing two wide, moved into second still two wide around the far turn, could make no impression on the winner but held safe for the
place. C MY MEISTER saved ground off the pace, advanced four wide around the far turn and was along for the show. DREAM OF A DAY raced well back
three wide and passed tiring rivals. SIR SAMUEL failed to menace while racing three and four wide. EDEN PARADISE saved ground off the pace, went
three wide between foes around the far turn, angled back to the rail nearing the quarter pole and never threatened. FAST N STEADY chased the pace two
wide around the first turn then retreated inside. OSKEE WOW WOW played no factor while racing three and four wide. QUANTUM THEORY prompted the
winner two wide and stopped around the far turn.

MY DESTINY prompted the pace from the two path into the turn, took over the lead from the rail passing the three eighths pole, was cued to open up while
drifting out to the four path entering the lane, and went clear. AMERICAN TAP was held up along the inside, tipped out three wide around the turn, was
driven from the six path into the stretch, and ran on but was second best. SIMPLIFY (ARG) stalked from the four path, was cued while three wide around the
turn, but evened out in the stretch for show. DEM A WONDER led from the three path into the turn, was overtaken by the eventual winner passing the three
eighths pole, and faded in the stretch. AWESOME ANNMARIE rated from the three path into the turn, was coaxed while shifting out five wide around the
turn, swung out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, but flattened. NINJA ABARRIO chased from the five path into the turn, shifted inwards to the rail

WHATCHAMACALL set the pace along the rail and widened under a drive. HOAX chased the winner two wide and was clearly second best. LE BOIANA
saved ground in range and was one-paced through the lane. TOQUETHER (IRE) raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally.
ANOTHERDAYGONEBY went evenly while racing four wide. JELLYBEAN chased the pace three wide, steadied near the quarter pole, angled to the rail in
upper stretch and faded. STRIKE JAK raced well back early, made a five wide move around the turn and retreated through the lane.

Footnotes
SUPER CORINTO (ARG) prompted the early pace from the three path around the first turn, took back to stalk from said position down the backstretch, was
driven from the seven path into the stretch, and drew past the pacesetting inside rival in the final sixteenth. CLAPTON tracked in the three path, took aim
while swinging out to the eight path entering the stretch, and chased home the winner to finish with place honors. MISH set the pace from inside, was cued
to open up from the two path around the far turn, floated out to the six path turning into the lane, and yielded inside the final furlong to show. KLUGMAN was
steadied from inside around the first turn and into the backstretch while racing behind the leading duo, saved ground around the far turn, but was empty
going into the stretch. LAUGHING BOY chased in the four path but was no menace. JESUS' TEAM stumbled at the start, trailed throughout, was eased
entering the lane, pulled up and walked off. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
PAWKY settled in range while racing three wide, cruised up three wide to take over nearing the five-sixteenths marker, quickly cleared and widened while
ridden out. NO WASABI FOR ME raced off the pace two wide, advanced two wide around the far turn and finished well to be clearly second best. ALWAYS
ROYAL saved ground in midpack, swung four wide in upper stretch and was along for the show. INSCRUTABLE tracked the pace two wide and faded in the
lane. MARVELOUS LADY failed to menace while racing two and three wide. VALIANT SHI SHI was bumped at the start, saved ground and never
threatened. WOLF RAYET trailed inside early, went four wide around the far turn and played no factor. GEM CAT broke outwardly and bumped VALIANT
SHI SHI at the start, was hustled to the lead, set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. ZOSTEROP stalked the pace in the
