Footnotes
MYSISTERNANCY bumped SULTRY SALLY H when bearing in at the break, chased the pace, was three wide turning for home, took the lead outside
MAMA'S EYES approaching the sixteenth pole then drove clear. BROOKLYN GIRL lacked speed, raced outside horses on the turn, was floated four deep
entering the stretch and had a mild rally outside rivals. DONNA'S COURAGE broke alertly, immediately dropped back, saved ground on the turn, moved to
the three path at the head of the stretch and offered a slight rally between horses. MAMA'S EYES sprinted to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail
and gave way the final furlong. SULTRY SALLY H , bumped leaving the starting gate, chased the pace to the stretch, gave way and was eased late.
SUSANAS LUCKYCHARM stumbled soon after the break, was four deep entering the turn and steadily dropped back.

Footnotes
MUSICMANSANDY sped clear early, set the pace towards the rail and under some rating, moved away past the five sixteenths, wandered outward from left
handed asking in mid stretch, was corrected and held firm while kept to task. MISS FUSSY PANTS , off the pace and off the rail, raced under asking while
four wide mid turn, shifted a bit wider for the drive and closed steadily to be along for the place. FANCEE GRACE C , away a bit awkwardly, was nudged up
soon after and tracked the winner two wide, was under a strong ride past the five sixteenths, remained the closest pursuer past mid stretch then gave way
grudgingly. COCKTAIL DREAMING saved ground off the pace, eased out a bit and closed between runners. ICE CUBE BABY broke slowly, recovered and
settled off the pace while saving ground, eased out nearing the lane, shifted back in and rallied. DON'T TELL DEREN , away alertly, stalked three wide, was
pushed along trying to maintain position mid turn, shifted four wide into the lane, failed to kick on and faded. FINE ALEIGH lagged back, came wide for the
drive and failed to respond.

stalked the pace, moved up three deep entering the stretch and gradually weakened. CROUCHELLI lacked speed, raced between horses in the drive and
passed tired ones. MONEY RIDE sped to the early lead, set the pace along the inner rail and weakened through the stretch run. GOLDEN GULLEY raced
along the inner rail early and gave way on the turn. WALK AWAY JOE , four deep on the turn, gave way and was eased late. MEAN MACHINE , outrun,
hugged the inner rail on the turn.

AWESOME VIEW , nicely rated three wide stalking the leaders, took closer order and was put to a ride mid turn, spun into the lane under stout left handed
asking, kept on doggedly under energetic urging to hook STAY OUT inside the sixteenth pole, sustained and forged ahead late. STAY OUT was hard sent
from the gate, eased out and moved up to engaged BAHAMA PEARL nearing the half mile marker, took over into the turn then cleared, was guided a bit
further off the inside in upper stretch, remained clear under a drive leaving mid stretch, dug in once collared then gave way grudgingly through the final
yards. FUNNYBET , sluggish from the gate, raced well back into the turn, came four wide for the drive but failed to muster up a serious kick. BAHAMA
PEARL sped clear early then dropped in towards the rail, ceded the lead into the turn, chased past the three eighths, failed to keep up entering the lane and
gave way through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CALL ME MAESTRO , off last, advanced between horses down the backstretch, was under urging three wide on the turn, continued to rally outside
NOTIMELIKEPRESENT through the stretch, over took that one inside the sixteenth pole and drove clear. NOTIMELIKEPRESENT set the pace near the
inner rail around the turn, was still clear in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. WIRED IN saved ground on the turn, angled off the rail in mid stretch, raced
between horses and passed tired ones. RED DEVOLUTION drifted in on a rival about a furlong after the break, steadied in close quarters along the inner
rail leaving the backstretch and weakened in the drive. AWESOME DYNAMO , checked when shut off by RED DEVOLUTION near the five eighths pole,
was four wide on the turn and lacked the necessary late response. WEST VIRGINIA BOY was not a factor. ROBBEDINTHEBAHAMAS , five wide on the
turn, weakened. TEGO was outrun. DESTINY JOY was outrun. GET THEM DIGITS , under urging down the backstretch, gave way in upper stretch and
was eased late.

MOSE PERFECT , away in good order, rated kindly three wide while stalking the leader, came under pressure leaving the far turn, closed in under left
handed asking in mid stretch, overtook NOSTALGIC RUN from his outside with a sixteenth to go and drew out under steady hand encouragement.
NOSTALGIC RUN took over between rivals then cleared entering the first turn, set the pace under a snug hold, raced two wide while still confidently
handled past the five sixteenths, came under pressure in upper stretch, wandered outward past mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. AWESOME MAN
rated two wide in mid pack early, was sent up between runners leaving the far turn and took aim, gave hard chase past the five sixteenths, swung out for the
drive and churned on. TATE , in a bit tight at the break, shifted out when brushing with JARDANI into the first turn, raced four wide past the three quarters
then moved up into the far turn, stayed in range under asking past the five sixteenths then flattened out. OUR LUCKY MAN , off the early pace, raced three
wide into the lane, angled out near mid stretch but lacked a menacing kick. JARDANI broke outward and was off a bit slow, brushed with a rival into the first
turn, was taken five wide for the backstretch run, rolled up outside rivals heading to the far turn, failed to kick on under asking past the three eighths and
faded. MAGIC MULE saved ground stalking the pace, was under asking leaving the far turn, lacked a punch past the five sixteenths and faded. HACHURE ,
three wide with some early pursuit, dropped back after five furlongs and angled in.

Footnotes
HYDRA , shuffled back leaving the starting gate, commenced her rally two wide entering the stretch, worked between horses in upper stretch, was steered
outside in mid stretch, closed under energetic urging and got up late. MY LOVELY GIRL prompted the pace outside SPICY MARGARITA around the turn,
gained a short lead in mid stretch and gave way grudgingly. SPICY MARGARITA , hustled to the early lead, moved over to the inner rail entering the turn,
set the pace along the rail and gradually weakened in the drive. FACTORINTHEHEAT raced in the three path between horses on the turn, swung four deep
entering the stretch and failed to rally. BEHIND THE COUCH , urged down the backstretch, chased the pace three deep around the turn and gave way the
final furlong. MADERA lacked speed and passed tired horses. ICY REPLY , steadied in tight quarters along the inner rail entering the turn, failed to be a
factor. BACI , four wide on the turn, gave way.

Footnotes
COMBAT QUEEN rated forwardly while saving ground, crept closer after a half mile, responded and slipped through along the rail to challenge soon into the
lane, battled inside a trio heading to mid stretch, wrested command soon after and edged clear late under a drive. LA CASA D'ORO sped to the front, set
the pace two wide, was hooked from both sides in upper stretch, battled on between runners leaving mid stretch, drifted out late but stayed on well. MY
FLICKER rated behind runners into the turn, angled out and was put to coaxing, ranged up and bid four deep entering the stretch, sparred on a slim lead in
mid stretch, failed to sustain near the sixteenth marker and faded. WHO KNOWS WHAT , off the early pace, edged up into the far turn, chased four wide
leaving the five sixteenths, shifted out wider for the drive but lacked a serious finish. THAT'S SOME KISS prompted the pace three wide outside the leader,
bid between foes nearing the lane, stayed on to about mid stretch, angled out and faded. DRY WELL , three wide leaving the far turn, angled out through
the drive but failed to menace. BLUEBERRY INDYGO broke a step slow, was hustled up between runners leaving the chute, steadied briefly near the five
eighths, dropped back off the pace into the turn and failed to respond. MIT MAZEL , off a bit awkwardly, secured the inside past the five eighths and
faltered.

Footnotes
BURGEE prompted the pace outside SPEAK UNITY around the turn, gained the lead approaching the eighth pole, was hooked late and got the good bob at
the finish. UNION FLEET raced in the two path around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch, rallied, drifted in a bit late, bid for the lead near the
finish and just missed. SHOOT THEMESSENGER saved ground around the turn, moved off the rail near the eighth pole, finished willingly between the top
pair and was caught in narrow quarters at the finish. SPEAK UNITY set the pace along the inner and lacked the necessary late response.
BLAMEITONTHEFUN , three deep chasing the pace around the turn, gave way and was eased late. An objection by the rider of SHOOT THEMESSENGER
against UNION FLEET for alleged interference approaching the finish was not allowed.
