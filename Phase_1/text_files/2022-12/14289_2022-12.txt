THAT'S SOMETHING broke slow from the gate then was settled, rallied and was five wide on the turn, powered to the front in mid stretch and drew off to be
ridden out in the end. TAP THE DOT stalked the pace while three wide into the turn, rallied and split rivals to be gaining ground and be second best. RUN
SLEWPY RUN was unhurried early then rallied four wide on the turn, made a bid in the stretch but was no menace. EUROMANTIC was well placed while
three wide into the turn, was in a long drive but weakened in late stretch. FLY TO THE BANK set a pressured pace while two wide, was in a long drive but
faltered in the stretch. COWBOY MISCHIEF chased the early pace while inside, saved ground on the turn but faltered in the drive. SALT CREEK KID rallied
four wide into the turn making a bid to upper stretch then flattened out in the drive. CHARING CROSS trailed throughout.
