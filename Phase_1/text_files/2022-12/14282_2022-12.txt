Footnotes
ALESHA well placed early on, advanced along the backstretch run, saved ground while within aim to the quarter marker, rallied inside in upper stretch, took
command nearing the sixteenth-marker, kept to task in deep stretch and held in a drive in the final stages. SHANGHAI MIST showed early speed and
prompted the moderate pace through the backstretch run, kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost ground nearing mid-stretch,
outfinished in the final sixteenth and just held for place. COCOA CENTS assumed an early tracking position, came three wide into the first turn, gained
ground from that three wide path nearing the quarter marker, came within aim in mid-stretch, outkicked in the late stages, just missed for place and held
safely for show. TROPICANA GIRL hustled to the early lead, set modest fractions while prompted to the second turn, came under pressure leaving the
quarter marker, held foes at bay to the furlong grounds and gave way in the final stages. FILLY PELLI allowed to settle, raced three wide into the
backstretch run, came four then five wide nearing the top of the lane and did not mount a late rally. KITTYBE QUICK unhurried in the early stages, lost
contact along the second turn and did not factor in the drive.

Footnotes
MAGICISTHEMOONLITE tracked the early pace, raced two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung three wide for the drive, kept to steady urging in the
lane, came within aim nearing the sixteenth-marker and made a good late push in deep stretch to prevail. UNION GIG forwardly placed in the early stages
and stalked the solid fractions through the turn, came three wide into upper stretch, lost ground nearing the furlong marker, re-rallied in the final stages,
outkicked by the winner and held for second in the end. NEXT JOURNEY allowed to settle in the early going, came three wide to the quarter marker,
mounted a bold late rally in the final furlong, could not reel in the top two in the final stages and held safely for show. RICKENBACHER broke alertly,
showed good early speed and set the pace through the turn, stayed clear to mid-stretch, overtaken inside of the sixteenth-marker and faded in the final
stages. MACHO CHROME chased the solid opening fractions, advanced while two wide nearing the top of the lane, could not sustain that run in the drive
and weakened. BETT ON BLAZE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten in the stretch run. CHANGED TIMES

ENJOY IT STRAIT raced three wide into the first turn, tracked the solid fractions to the half-mile marker, roused three wide leaving the three-furlong marker,
assumed command in upper stretch, drew clear inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in the final sixteenth over the oncoming runner-up. SPEED
GRAZY off a bit slowly, unhurried in the early stages, advanced three wide on the far turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, found room in
mid-stretch, closed in the late stages, could not reel in ENJOY IT STRAIT in deep stretch and finished second best. ROARING TIGER allowed to settle,
roused four wide on the second turn, came within aim nearing mid-stretch, outkicked in the final sixteenth and clear for show. MY DOMINATOR allowed to
settle, roused five wide nearing the quarter marker, came within aim nearing mid-stretch, could not sustain that bid and weakened. OBVIOUS broke alertly
and established the early pace, set decent fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure into the second turn, met that bid to the quarter
marker, could not keep pace with ENJOY IT STRAIT in upper stretch and gave way in the late stages. ROISTER raced closest to the clear pacesetter into
the backstretch run, stalked the pace to the half-mile marker, vied for the lead nearing the top of the lane, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CODE RIBBON unhurried in the early going, roused leaving the three-furlong marker, circled five wide into the drive, closed with a rush in deep stretch, kept
pace with BLUE WILDCAT in the final jumps and was up in the final strides for the win. BLUE WILDCAT raced close to the early pace, advanced while two
wide nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied inside of the furlong marker, took a narrow lead while matching strides with CODE
RIBBON in deep stretch, was tagged in the final strides by that rival for the win and held for second. ZAZEN stalked the solid early fractions, raced three
wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and kept on to secure third. ICONIC SKY broke alertly and showed good early
speed to dictate terms to the turn, set solid fractions to the quarter marker, extended the lead into upper stretch, was all out inside of the furlong marker and
gave way in the final stages. MISS UNION rated off of the solid early fractions, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid to
mid-stretch and flattened out in the final sixteenth. DULCE EMMA crowded at the start and away a step slowly, rushed up heading to the turn, lost ground
nearing the top of the lane and came up empty in the drive.

Footnotes
MYBLUEBELL (FR) showed early speed and was forwardly placed into the first turn, attended to the modest fractions thorugh the backstretch run, overtook
MOON ROCKET nearing the quarter marker, drew clear approaching mid-stretch and kept to task while pulling away in the final sixteenth. GRIGORO
unhurried in the early stages, raced four wide into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and stalked the pace to the second turn, chased in
pursuit while three then four wide nearing the top of the lane, made a slight gain on MYBLUEBELL in the drive but could not reel that rival in in deep stretch
and secured second in the final stages. DEL MAR FLASH crowded at the start and away a step slowly, recovered heading to the first turn, was a bit keen
along the first turn and into the backstretch run, saved ground while stalking the pace to the second turn, weakened in the drive and kept on to be clear in
the end for third. NICOLE GRACE allowed to settle while not far back in the early going, raced two wide into the second turn, improved position in upper
stretch and lacked a late rally. MOON ROCKET sent to the early lead, set modest fractions while pressured to the half-mile marker, was overtaken nearing
the quarter pole, lost ground in upper stretch and faded late. KISS RIDE GOODBYE raced three wide into the first turn while rating off of the pace, advanced
along the backstretch run, came three then four wide approaching the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired in the stretch run.

fractious in the starting gate, settled off of the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run, raced four wide to the quarter marker and was not a late
factor. ALPHABETICAL stalked the early pace while three wide on the first turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker and faltered in the stretch run.
TOMMY SPECIAL showed early speed and contested the pace into the backstretch run, dropped back nearing the half-mile marker, stopped along the
second turn, was eased through the stretch and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
BOB'S VAI broke alertly and assumed command of the early lead, set solid fractions through the turn, drew clear to mid-stretch, was tiring in the final
stages, was fully extended in the final strides and held on to prevail. GET MY POINT rated off of the early pace, saved ground while advancing on the
second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed fast in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while getting up in the final strides to secure second. A
ROUSING BABE was shuffled back at the start and off a step slowly, chased the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, steadied in tight quarters
nearing the top of the stretch, swung five wide for the drive, closed fast in the final furlong and just missed for the win and place, while getting up in time to
secure third. FIXYURHAIRUPRETTY settled in the second flight, advanced two wide entering the turn, came in tight nearing the top of the lane, swung four
wide for the drive, made a good late rally and challenged for third in the final strides. SASSY TINKERBELL was a bit fractious in the starting gate, hopped at
the break and was away slowly, lacked speed to the turn, was carried out five wide leaving the three-furlong marker, swung widest for the drive and found
her best stride late. PRANCIN N THE PARK shuffled at the start and away a bit slowly, chased from the second flight to the turn, lost position three wide
along the turn, swung five wide in upper stretch and finished well in the final furlong. OTTER POP was forwardly placed in the early going, stalked the solid
fractions three wide on the turn, lost ground while chasing BOB'S VAI to mid-stretch and weakened in the final furlong. STANDFORGRIT showed early
speed and pressed the pace to the turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way. DRAW NEAR stalked the
early pace, advanced four wide on the turn, could not sustain that run in the drive and tired in the late stages. TIZ SO SPECIAL lacked early speed and was
not a factor.
