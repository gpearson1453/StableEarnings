Footnotes
ACEHIGH ROYAL away well, dueled up the backstretch off the inside, put the other speed away turning for home between rivals, engaged with the runner
up soon after, headed nearing the furlong marker, regained the advantage late and dug in the final strides to prove narrowly best in game fashion. STILL ON
THE BOOKS in the second flight early off the inside, ranged up three wide to challenge into the lane, put a head in front approaching the furlong grounds,
outkicked in the late going while clearly second best. BOURBON ON FIRE void of early foot off the inside, steered out wider to be in the four path turning for
home, staged a mild rally to be clear of the others, no real threat to the top two. SHAKEDOWN STREET in the second flight off the inside, within striking
distance turning for home, lacked a closing kick. LITTLE FRAPPUCINO last to leave, moved up closer along the inside, briefly challenged the leaders from
the rail early turn, remained in traffic late in the bend then went evenly through the lane when clear. BOLD MEDICATION with the winner inside that one in
the run up the backstretch, dropped to the rail early in the turn, continued on equal terms with the winner until exiting the bend and then gave way.

Footnotes
DISTORTED SECRETS dropped inside the opening quarter, crept up and challenged inside the two leaders by midway on the turn, came out to float that
same pair out turning for home, dueled to the wire well off the inside through the stretch, proved determined late. CATECHISM with pace from the start, vied
between rivals late in the turn, floated out by the winner entering the stretch, dueled to the wire while remaining outside that rival, denied in the late stages.
NOSTALGIA dueled up front outside the runner up, three path into the turn, floated out a bit wide exiting the bend, proved no match for the top two in the
drive, remained well clear of the others. GIRLS A BULLET back off the early pace while working way toward the inside, saved some ground in the second
flight turn, went one paced through the lane in lacking a closer response. LOVELY LADY LEXI raced back off the pace and the inside, also proceeded
evenly in the drive. WICKED CHOCOLATE lacked early foot, three wide out of the turn, failed to muster a rally as well. COSTANARMANDALEG in the
second group early three wide, faded through the stretch. BRIAR THICKET broke in the air, trailed throughout.

Footnotes
STRIKINGLY SPUN broke back, unhurried early off the inside, moved strongly to a forward position three wide through the first turn, took over into the
stretch, drew clear under steady handling. BOLT FOR ALLISON in traffic midway on the first turn, shifted out then back in late in that bend, in the two path
into and through the far turn when with the second flight, staged a mild rally to be in time for the place, no real threat to the winner. PEACE CRUISER
dueled early closest to the inside, fell back and chased the leader up the backstretch, took over far turn, briefly clear, weakened in proving no match for the
top two final furlong, remained well clear of the others. MADLY DANCING within striking distance early, fell back, no real threat through the lane to finish up
early. PERFECTLY GOLDEN broke back, lacked speed off the inside, not a threat. AISHA R N dueled into the first turn, cleared and dropped inside,
showed the way up the backstretch then gave way when headed far turn. BICARB BETTY last away, trailed throughout and showed little. FINAL TIME

Footnotes
FLAP JACK moved up steadily along the inside to gain command before a quarter, continued along the inside when clear before a half, continued to draw
out steadily through the lane, geared down late to win ridden out. MACRON moved a bit closer in the two path through the turn, came three wide out of the
bend, proved no match for the winner, remained well clear of the others. MAGIC CASTLE lacked early foot, in some light traffic late in the turn, staged a
mild rally to be up late for the show. COST BASIS vied early off the inside, raced in the two path through the turn, tired through the stretch. HOME BASE off
slowly to spot the field a couple of lengths, lacked speed, in tight then steadied in some traffic early turn, failed to muster a rally through the stretch. WIPE
THE SLATE made little impact while three wide. NATE'S WAY with the early pace, began a steady fade after a quarter. FINAL WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO
TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
WESLEYAN away in good order, raced with the pace closest to the inside, shook clear when straightened for home, responded when confronted late and
held that rival safe at the wire under steady handling. COLE SPUR forwardly placed while racing outside, three wide through the turn, set down when
straightened for home, closed the gap on the winner late, not enough in the final strides. LANSDOWNE broke out, pressed the issue off the inside for a half,
fell back off the winner into the lane, could not contain the runner up either the final furlong, narrowly lasted for the show. MY NOAH one paced off the pace
while inside, continued to save ground through the turn, proved no threat to the top two, just missed the show. ROMANCER lacked early foot, angled out
four wide when moving a bit closer exiting the turn, continued to display some mild late interest. RUNQUIETLY shuffled back at the break to be last away,
dropped inside after moving up to mid pack, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing response. SEE SPOT RUN three wide early when well off the
pace, angled to the inside through the turn, picked off a few tiring rivals while not a serious threat. SERBIAN SAILOR had little for the drive while racing
toward the inside. SKYLINE tired while racing four wide. SUPER GEEK moved out, four wide, midway on the turn, remained back. RISKY SITUATION in
mid pack early just off the inside, staged a steady retreat after three furlongs.

Footnotes
SHE'S STORMING closest to the dueling leaders off the inside, three wide turning for home, angled to the rail past the furlong marker, challenged inside the
leader and closed with good resolve to be up in time. INDIAN IRISH broke alertly, set or forced the pace closest to the inside, two path into lane, shook off
the other speed to be clear inside the furlong grounds, could not contain the winner. TIMBAVATI dueled up front outside the runner up, three path into the
lane, weakened a bit while drifting out slightly the final furlong, comfortably saved the show. FORTIBUG lacked early foot off the inside, moved to the inside
through the turn, improved position upper stretch then flattened out a bit through the stretch. REAUX BINA void of speed, continued back midway on the
turn, swung four wide for the drive, also improved position with some mild late interest. MAGNOLIA MAE in mid pack and inside, tired through the stretch.
AUNT CARI four wide when back off the pace into the turn, three wide midway on the bend, then was four wide again into the lane, tired. PAT'S GAL saved
ground to no vail. COROMANDEL tired in the good path. HONEYCAMP in the second group outside the winner, four wide exiting the turn, gave way in the
drive. WILD ROSEY remained back while three wide. FEATURETTE off slow, never a threat. FINAL WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
HAZY COMMAND off slowly, continued to be outrun early inside, moved closer by skimming the rail into the stretch, shifted out nearing the furlong marker,
challenged the leader with a sixteenth remaining and quickly kicked clear. HYPERSPORT within striking distance well out in the strip, came four to five wide
out of the turn, rallied down the middle of the strip to annex the place, no match for the winner. EMPIRE PASS away well, shook clear before a quarter,
extended that advantage through the turn, continued to show the way past the furlong marker, faltered when headed by the winner a sixteenth out, could not
contain the runner up. KANT BELIEVE IT forwardly placed well off the inside, four wide and between foes into lane, lacked a closing kick. RING ME
DARLING broke out, lacked speed while four wide into the turn, angled a bit to be three wide into the lane, displayed a mild amount of late interest while not
a serious threat. LOFTHOUSE off a step slow, raced back in the two path, improved slightly with never dangerous. AQUILA MOON fell back to trail soon
after the start, angled out four wide into the stretch, improved by passing tiring rivals while widest down the stretch. DIVA TREVA chased early, began a
steady retreat in the two path just before a half. HEATED ARGUMENT settled early, closer in the two path in a busy second flight through the turn, gave
way when the real running began at the head of the lane. SHOW ME GRACE never menaced while racing three wide. BACKYARD MONEY was finished
early while racing three wide.

Footnotes
COUNT DE MONET forwardly placed inside after the break, boxed in along the rail late backstretch, remained inside and covered up followed the winner
into the lane shifted out a bit when straightened for home, wore the leader down and drove clear. ALTO ROAD last to leave, sluggish early in falling further
back, came four wide into the lane, shifted out widest outside of traffic upper stretch, finished with good energy to be in time for the place. TYLER'S TRIBE
broke sharp, set a mildly pressured pace in the two path, continued to show the way into the lane, responded when the winner challenged nearing the
furlong grounds, relented to that one late, continued to weaken and was caught late for the place. FROSTED DEPARTURE in the second group just off the
inside, two path through the turn, lacked a closing punch through the lane. HOW DID HE DO THAT void of early foot, displayed some mild late interest while
also lacking a serious closing response. HAPPY IS A CHOICE back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the stretch, bothered slightly by a drifting
WILD MULE in upper stretch, finished up evenly when clear. WILD MULE in mid pack while racing outside, three wide into the lane, drifted out in upper
stretch and had little left late. C. J'S STORM in the second flight early, faded. TOO MUCH INFO moved up to chase the leader into the turn, began to give
way soon after.

Footnotes
PATTERN BET jostled at the start, settled in mid pack inside, continued inside when covered up through the turn, steered out three wide for room late in the
bend, drifted out a bit in upper stretch, challenged past the furlong marker and drew clear. MO WANNA GO broke well, cleared while washy up the
backstretch, continued to show the way through the turn by daylight, shrugged off a foe into the lane, proved no match for the winner late while holding for
the place. GOLD STRATEGY bumped at the break, recovered to move up and chase the runner up into the turn, lodged a brief bid from the outside turning
for home but could not match the top two to the wire. DELTA MOON within striking distance off the inside, was carried out by the winner into the three to
four path turning for home, bothered slightly by that rival as that one drifted a bit when straightened for home, lacked a closing response to finish up evenly.
MIRACLE SHOES back off the lead and the inside, came four wide for the drive, went one paced through the stretch to finish up one paced.
COURAGEOUS CAPPEN in mid pack and off the inside, lacked a serious closing bid. FIRST RATE ROMANCE bothered at the start, also failed to serious
menace while saving ground. LITTLE ROCKER chased the early leader, three wide late in the turn, four wide into the stretch, bothered slightly upper lane,
weakened. MIZ GISELA broke out bothering outer foes, took up in traffic early and remained always back. BOOTLEGGING GIRL in mid pack and outside,
four wide into the turn, three wide exiting, tired. SWEET BABY KATE remained always back while racing off the inside. TENZING five wide into the turn,
tired. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE RIDER OF SWEET BABY KATE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE INTO THE STRETCH, NO RESULT WAS TAKEN.
