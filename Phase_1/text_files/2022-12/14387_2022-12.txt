Footnotes
SENOR MIKE broke readily, conceded the lead to track outside the pacesetter through the backstretch, steadily advanced on that foe nearing upper stretch,
took over nearing midstretch, then gamely held the challenge of DASH TO THE CASH to the end under firm right handed pressure. The latter broke
outwards bumping PUNISH KING at the start, was settled between foes in the opening stages, angled to the rail nearing the turn steadily gathering
momentum, drew into striking distance nearing upper stretch, shifted out three wide racing through the lane while being roused to challenge for command
but couldn't gain even terms with the winner. KISS N BIZ was urged clear from the break along the inside, set the pace into the bend, dueled for command
into upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair leaving the furlong marker and drifted out late. J J'S SOLUTION settled last, angled 5-wide into stretch,
no impression. PUNISH KING bumped start, tracked leaders 3-wide to turn, gave way into lane. KRUELESS tracked 4-wide early, dropped back turn,
swerved 3/16, bumped. NAGY AND DA BEARS settled rail, saved ground, bumped 3/16.

Footnotes
BOURBON TEDDY was hustled for speed inside and cleared early, was pushed along on the rail around the turn, opened up when asked in upper stretch,
went to a drive midstretch, and held despite gradually drifting out. TAPIT SAM settled at the rear inside, hugged the rail on the turn, angled out in upper
stretch and went to a drive past the three sixteenths, responded well, found his best in the final furlong and gained to the finish. EVIDENCE chased midfield
down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, was driven in the three path in upper stretch, shifted out approaching midstretch, chased on willingly
but was outfinished late for the place. HINK'S PALADIN stalked the pace outside of BOURBON TEDDY, raced two wide on the turn, was driven in range in
upper stretch but could not reel the pacesetter in, and chased on until flattening inside foes in the final sixteenth. TSALI chased between horses early but
was taken back near the rear past the nine sixteenths, raced in the three path between horses in the rear group around the bend, shifted out in upper
stretch, and chased on mildly to pass tiring horses. ROLL DINERO ROLL raced midfield early, advanced approaching the half to stalk the leading pair,
tracked in the four path on the turn, proved no match for BOURBON TEDDY and HINK'S PALADIN into the lane, was grazed by TAPIT SAM midstretch
while chasing between horses, and weakened. THE GEEK settled near the rear, raced three deep with the rear flight in the six path on the turn, was driven
near the center of the track in upper stretch and offered no bid.

Footnotes
BASEBALL POLITICS raced in attendance to the leaders three deep under light reserve in the opening quarter, steadily advanced to press the issue
outside LUCKY SHOT nearing upper stretch, dispatched that foe leaving the furlong marker and went clear late under firm right handed encouragement.
The latter broke sharply, was urged along the inside disputing the pace inside foes into the turn, dueled with the winner into upper stretch, weakened
midstretch, then drifted out in the closing stages. TEE BURNS hopped at the start, angled to the inside tracking off the first flight racing into the bend,
switched out racing into upper stretch and continued well enough to prevail for a share. ROCKET HOTSHOT settled well off the field racing through the
backstretch, saved ground through the turn, then came around some tiring rivals in the closing stages while never proving a real threat. CINDY'S STORM
flashed brief pace between foes racing through the backstretch and emptied out abruptly entering the turn. RIDING THE TRAIN tracked off the first flight
outside a rival racing into the turn, angled out four wide in upper stretch and came up empty in the drive. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE RIDER OF LUCKY
SHOT LODGED A CLAIM OF FOUL AGAINST THE WINNER ALLEGING INTERFERENCE MIDSTRETCH BUT THAT CLAIM WAS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
JACKS SPRING BREAK chased three wide early, chased outside of POWERFUL MAN into the backstretch, advanced to join the tracking flight outside of
CHOCOLATE BUNNY near the five eighths, rallied three wide past the three eighths, and engaged outside of MY BROTHER CAM, continued to give chase
just behind that foe into the lane, was carried out as that foe drifted out, but nonetheless reeled him in near the sixteenth and cleared late. MY BROTHER
CAM broke inward into EMPTY HOLSTER in the opening strides, tracked the leading flight between horses around the first turn, joined keenly outside of
CHOCOLATE BUNNY into the backstretch, edged closer to BOURBON DELIGHT approaching the far turn and dueled outside that foe into the turn, led
near the three eighths, was engaged by JACKS SPRING BREAK to his outside soon after, was driven on a narrow lead in upper stretch, kept on past the
furlong mark while drifting out, but was headed for good by JACKS SPRING BREAK near the sixteenth and proved second best. KNIEVEL settled inside
toward the rear, edged forward to chase between horses near the five eighths, chased three wide between horses on the far turn, rallied between horses in
upper stretch, angled inside approaching midstretch and loomed inside of the leading pair, but flattened out in the final furlong. EMPTY HOLSTER was
bumped between SON OF GRACE and MY BROTHER CAM in the opening strides, settled two wide near the rear, inched forward from the five eighths, bid
four wide around the far turn, came five wide into the lane, was outkicked by the leaders, and finished only evenly late. CHOCOLATE BUNNY raced
between horses early, tracked inside of the leader around the clubhouse turn, tracked the leading pair inside of JACKS SPRING BREAK down the
backstretch, was shuffled toward the rear while racing in the two to three path on the far turn as others improved outside of him, was driven between horses
in upper stretch and chased on mildly. POWERFUL MAN raced at the inside of the leading flight early but settled back to chase inside, chased inside of
KNIEVEL down the back straight, saved ground around the turn but was relegated to the rear while caught behind traffic, and lacked the needed rally in the
lane. SON OF GRACE broke outward, was held up at the rear, raced toward the rear in the three to four path on the far turn, came six wide into the lane
and had no bid. BOURBON DELIGHT was hustled to the lead, edged clear three and then two wide on the first turn, set the pace alone until engaged by MY
BROTHER CAM near the nine sixteenths, dueled inside that foe into the far turn, began to weaken inside near the three eighths and had no more in the
lane.

Footnotes
LOOKIN FOR BALA gained a forward placing outside foes while under light rating in the opening stages, prompted the pacesetter racing into the turn,
pressed the issue between foes nearing upper stretch, then edged forward leaving midstretch under energetic handling to prove best. FEVER NATION
tracked off the first flight outside rivals in the opening stages, continued outside a rival in the two path racing into the turn, shifted out three wide nearing
upper stretch while moving to terms with the eventual winner challenging that rival but couldn't match terms with that foe in the closing stages while
prevailing for the place honors. CHI TOWN HUSTLER was rated just off the leaders along the inside racing through the backstretch, saved ground on the
turn, came around a tiring foe racing into upper stretch, then angled inside the top pair midstretch while continuing willingly to close the gap while earning a
share. RIGHT ON RICHIE settled inside foes dropping off the second flight racing into the bend, tipped out in upper stretch and gained some position with
an even effort. RIVZONAROLL broke sharply, was urged to the lead along the inside disputing the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn and quickly
gave way in upper stretch. SAWYER FOX tracked off the second flight between foes racing through the backstretch but faded from contention midway
through the turn. EL MUCHO hesitated at the start losing position to the field and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MUD ISLAND chased outside of SONNYISNOTFUNNY early, continued to chase in the four to five path on the turn, came five wide into the lane, drifted out
under a drive in upper stretch, chased willingly through midstretch, kicked on with a rush in the final sixteenth and got up in the last jumps. ALPINE GHOST
tracked the leading pair down the backstretch and while positioned three wide on the turn, was driven approaching the quarter pole, swung four wide into
the lane, started reeling in the leader in earnest past midstretch, caught him with about fifty yards remaining but was nailed in the last jumps. CINDY'S G
MAN was hustled inside, took the lead inside of TALKTOEACHOTHER near the five eighths, saved ground while clear on the far turn, was pushed along in
upper stretch and continued well clear through midstretch, but flattened late and was caught with about fifty yards to go. GLOBAL EMPIRE was bumped
between horses early and settled at the rear, trailed along the fence on the turn, rallied in upper stretch, sustained his rally inside and kept on good interest
to the finish, and narrowly missed the show. VITALE settled near the rear down the backstretch and in the four path on the turn, swung out near the center
of the track into the lane, was carried out in upper stretch and brushed with SONNYISNOTFUNNY as that one drifted out, nonetheless kept on with good
interest and closed up ground belatedly outside. TALKTOEACHOTHER broke outward, soon led, was joined inside by CINDY'S G MAN and headed
approaching the five eighths, pressed the pace two wide from there, tracked two wide on the turn as that foe cleared, was no match to the lane, chased on
to the sixteenth and flattened out between foes late. SONNYISNOTSOFUNNY chased inside of MUD ISLAND, raced in the three path on the turn, swung
near the center of the track into the lane, brushed with VITALE in upper stretch while drifting out, and ultimately came up empty.

Footnotes
JETS A GINNIN, off a step slowly, pulled her way to terms with the pacesetter through the backstretch prompting that rival under light rating, pressed the
issue outside that foe on the bend to gain the advantage in upper stretch and went clear under firm handling. ISABELLACANNETELLA was rated tracking
just off the leaders along the inside in the opening stages, shifted out three wide leaving the turn while being prompted to advance, couldn't gain terms with
the winner but proved best of the others. ATHENAS SONG settled last along the inside in the opening stages, tipped off the inside after the opening quarter,
swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to edge rivals for a share at the wire. JULIAISON was settled between
foes in the opening stages, shifted in to save ground on the turn to upper stretch, then switched outside a tiring rival in the closing stages to just miss for a
share while racing in close quarters between rivals nearing the wire. LIPLINER broke sharply, angled to the rail setting the pace on a narrow advantage into
the turn, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into upper stretch and gave way in late stages. WAR COLORS settled outside foes on the
backstretch and steadily faded between foes racing into the stretch.

Footnotes
PALACE MAGIC comfortably raced to the early lead inside, continued on a clear lead in the two path on the turn, opened up more when shaken up in upper
stretch, was driven midstretch, and stayed on while kept to the task until late. FIELD DAISEY raced near the rear inside of BEING CREATIVE early, was
pushed along and rallied in the four path on the turn, floated into the lane in the six path under a drive, proved no match for PALACE MAGIC but kept on
willingly to hold for the place. LORI ATTACK was urged for pace early but outsprinted to the lead by PALACE MAGIC to her inside, tracked the leader down
the backstretch, chased the leading pair in the two path on the turn, was pushed along from the three eighths after being passed by FIELD DAISEY to her
outside and driven in upper stretch, and kept on evenly late for show. AIKEN TO BE TAKIN chased outside of RUNAWAY A. TRAIN early, took closer order
approaching the half, tracked the leader in the three path on the turn, raced into the lane in the four to five path but proved no match for the pacesetter,
chased between horses to midstretch and flattened out in the final furlong. MINI DRESS settled at the rear, saved ground on the turn, went to a drive near
the quarter, passed a few foes in upper stretch but ultimately lacked enough late kick to threaten the leaders. FIVE ROSES LUNA chased inside foes early,
continued midfield in the three path on the turn, floated out near the center of the track into the lane, and lacked the needed rally. BEING CREATIVE raced
at the outside of the rear flight early, continued in the five path near the rear around the turn, raced into the stretch in the six path and mustered no bid.
RUNAWAY A. TRAIN chased between horses early, settled back toward the rear near the nine sixteenths, raced in the four path between horses on the
turn, came five wide into the lane and proved empty.
