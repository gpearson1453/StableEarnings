Footnotes
DR OSERAN dueled inside of foes in the two path, edged clear in upper stretch and held safe to a diminishing margin late. SALT SPRAY (IRE) dueled
between foes, could not quite match strides with the winner in upper stretch, kept trying and was gaining late. LAWFUL raced off the pace three wide,
angled widest in upper stretch and ran on for the show. LIEUTENANT STAN tracked the pace inside, bid inside of the winner nearing the eighth pole and
flattened out late. COOLER KING pressed the pace in the four path, continued on the left lead in the lane, had the rider lose the whip in midstretch and
faded. ROYAL MENDE failed to menace while racing three wide. JAMESTOWN broke a bit awkwardly, raced four wide and never threatened. SIDE EYE
chased the pace in the two path and lacked a rally. VICTORY LINE was off slowly, raced well back inside, angled out in the lane, made some progress then
checked off heels in the final strides. MASTER OOGWAY was off slowly and never involved while racing two wide. EL BURRITO was outrun while racing
four wide.

Footnotes
MAJOR PRYCE stalked along the inside, tipped out and ranged up three wide around the far turn, bid while floating out to the six path entering the lane,
took over, and drew clear in the final furlong. BLACK ICE raced from off the pace in the three path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and ran on
down the center to get up for place. BREAKING BULLET prompted the pace in the three path, bid from two wide into the far turn, led entering the stretch,
but evened out nearing the eighth pole and finished with show honors. BULLET VALENTINA rated from inside, was coaxed from the four path entering the
lane, but was one paced. IRON LOTUS set the pace from the two path, was headed around the far turn, and yielded while shifting out to the three path
going into the final furlong. FOR THE THRILL was bumped by an inner rival at the start, tracked the pace while three wide, checked between foes around
the far turn, and never threatened. SAMURAI'SDON'TCRY broke out and bumped an outer foe, chased from the five path but was empty going into the
stretch.

THELASTBULLETSMINE stalked from the two path, was roused while tipping out to the five path turning into the lane, bid from said position going into the
final furlong, took the lead and held off a late charging outer foe to win. DAVID'S ROSE chased from the three path early, swung out to the six path into the
lane, ran on and bid going into the final furlong, but was repelled by the winner late to finish with place honors. TALKIN TIPSY prompted the pace from the
four path, bid from the three path going into the stretch, but evened out passing the eighth pole to show. DREAMING OF AUDREY rated along the inside,
was coaxed from the three path into the stretch, and passed tiring rivals from said position. SHEZA SPITFIRE hit the left side of the gate at the start,
recovered well and was prominent in the five path going into the turn, but flattened in the stretch. MY SASSENACH pressed the early pace from the three
path but backed up around the turn. SHOOTLIKEAGIRL set the pace from inside, was cued from the two path turning into the lane, but yielded nearing the
eighth pole.

VIBURNUM chased in the four path, was roused to bid going into the far turn, swept to the lead turning into the stretch, and was driven clear. LISHEEN
rated in the three path, moved up around the far turn, was cued from the five path turning into the lane, and chased home the winner to get place honors.
FLYING FORTRESS raced keenly while close up in the four path, took back slightly to stalk from said position, was driven from the six path into the stretch,
and kept on late to get up for show. BESIDE HERSELF set the pace from the two path, was coaxed when headed early around the far turn, floated out to
the three path going into the stretch, but faded. STARSHIP MALLOMAR prompted the pace from the five path, bid from the three path going into the far
turn, but flattened down the lane. GOOD AMERICAN (GB) raced from off the pace in the five path but never factored. CHAMPAGNE IVY raced from
wellback along the inside throughout and never threatened. TREASURE OF WAR tracked along the inside but was empty going into the stretch. PER
RULING FROM THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, VIBURNUM WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
UNCORK THE BOTTLE dueled outside of SEA TRIDENT in the three path and edged ahead under left-handed in the final furlong. SEA TRIDENT dueled
inside of the winner in the two path and gave way grudgingly. DOO WOP DON stalked the top two while racing three and four wide, could not reel in those
foes but stayed on for the show. TONE FEELIN raced in range inside for a half, angled into the two path midway around the turn and lacked the needed
stretch kick. CARAMEL CHIP saved ground and failed to menace. JOE DI BAGGIO had early speed four wide and faded after a half.

Footnotes
AARAJ ducked in at the start, set the pace in the two path, was cued to open up from the five path into the lane, drifted out, but was much the best.
ARCANGELO trailed from the four path into the turn, moved up while swinging out to the eight path going into the stretch, and ran on down the center for
place. INFINITE SERIES tracked in the four path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but evened out late to show. POINT LIAM was coaxed along
from the four path, floated out to the seven path turning into the stretch, but was one paced. LOVE SPELL broke inwards and stalked from the two path but
faded in the stretch. SECRET THREAT rated along the inside, shifted out to the three path going into the lane, but was tired. COLLECT DIS MONEY
pressed from the four path, was cued from the three path around the turn, but weakened. DRINKING PROBLEM broke out at the start and chased in the
five path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
LIVING WATER set the pace from inside, was cued to open up turning into the lane, responded well and was much the best. NITROUS CHANNEL
prompted the pace in the three path, was driven from the four path into the stretch, rider lost whip nearing the eighth pole, but ran on to secure place.
LUDINGTON tracked the pace from two wide, steadied slightly into the turn, was coaxed from the rail into the lane, and finished evenly for show.
AERONAUT rated in the five path, was driven from the six path into the lane, but was one paced. CELESTIAL GLAZE raced from off the pace in the two
path and was no factor. MAGIC ECLIPSE trailed from the six path early and never threatened. HE'S IN CHARGE stalked along the inside, steadied slightly
going into the turn, and weakened in the stretch from the five path. BEN COPENHAGEN chased from the three path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
OUTPERFORM had his head turned at the start, trailed inside, advanced three wide around the far turn, bulled through five wide in upper stretch, kicked in
once clear and was up in deep stretch. JERRY'S TURN pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead near the five-sixteenths marker, angled to the rail
in upper stretch and led until deep stretch. GOOD SOLDIER raced off the pace three and four wide, came six wide into the lane and ran on to gain the show
late. CLEVER ENOUGH raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, had a mild bid in upper stretch and flattened out.
UNEXPECTED OUTCOME (IRE) chased the pace two and three wide and weakened in the lane. WILD FLIGHT set the pace in the two path and gave way
near the five-sixteenths marker.
