Footnotes
DARE ME broke out a bit, settled behind the pace inside, advanced steadily into a striking position in the two path by late in the turn, took over entering the
stretch, took over, drew out through the lane under confident handling to win with something left. MI CRESCENDO dropped inside, lacked early foot while
saving ground, continued back then began to advance after moving off the inside by late in the bend, proved no match for the winner while up late for the
place. AIN'TNOSWEETIE fractious in the post parade, one paced off the inside, closest to the winner while not a threat to that one just inside the furlong
grounds, caught late for the place. BAD OUTLOOK last to leave, devoid of speed, displayed a mild amount of late interest to improve position off the inside,
not a serious threat. ESSENTIAL BELLA forced the issue up front off the inside, took over in the turn, faltered when headed by the winner into the lane,
continued to falter through the stretch. RCAPTIVATING remained back, picked off a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat. G MONEY LIV in the second
flight early off the inside, began a steady retreat while four wide turning into the stretch. TORCH OF HONOR flashed some brief speed along the inside,
gave way before a half. PER RULING DATED 1/9/2023 RECEIVED FROM THE ARKANSAS . STATE RACING COMMISSION (RULING #2023-OP-04),
DARE ME WAS DQ'D DUE TO A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
HERD IMMUNITY outrun in the early going, moved to the inside early in the turn, slipped through along the rail to challenge turning for home, long duel to
the wire, dug in late to find more and narrowly prevail. TOWN CHAMP with the pace from the start, floated out to be three wide while between horses
turning for home, hooked up with the winner soon after outside that one, extended duel to the wire, led late, outgamed in the late going. RELEASED lacked
speed, raced three wide in the second flight through the turn, rallied late for the show, not a serious threat to the top two. COOL RUNNINGS lacked speed
off the inside, three wide through the turn, widest in the drive, improved position late, not enough for the show. PULL MY CHAIN broke on top, raced with
the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued to vie three to four wide turn, tired in the drive, lost show late. AWESOME FAMILY in the second
flight, had little for the drive. SAHM TEQUILA last away, trailed most of the way and was never a factor. NORTH SIDE bobbled just after the start, moved up
to contest the pace the opening furlong, held a narrow advantage through the turn, gave way in the drive.

Footnotes
CAWKAB forwardly placed from the start, advanced, bid in the two path second turn, briefly dueled in upper stretch, shook clear nearing the furlong
grounds, lugged out a bit with a sixteenth to run under a left handed stick, maintained daylight to the wire under steady handling. ANDY CANT settled in mid
pack off the .inside, ranged up into contention four wide late in the final turn, saw that advance stall a bit upper stretch, late push to be clear for the second
spot, not a serious threat to the winner. STAND PROUD off a step slow, lacked speed for six furlongs, displayed a mild amount of late interest, along for the
show. PLAUSIBLE DENILE forwardly paced inside first turn, advanced three wide second turn, bid, dueled outside the winner upper stretch, could not
match that one nearing midstretch while drifting out, weakened to lose a couple of positions late. CHROME RUN fell back to trail after the start, was never in
contention. ORDER OF MERIT broke alertly, worked way clear into the first turn, set the pace inside, stopped when headed late in the final turn.

Footnotes
GOOD PENNY unhurried early in the two path, continued to be outrun up the backstretch in hand, began to advance far turn, came three wide for the drive,
long drive to the wire, fully extended to be up in the final strides. SHEZZ KOLDAZICE forwardly placed into first turn inside,traffic, moved out and stalked in
the two path backstretch while rating, bid second turn, put a head in front a furlong out, continued to lead late, could not contain the winner in the waning
strides, clearly second best. GIANNA'S GIFT away in good order, angled to the inside entering the first turn, set the pace, continued to show the way into
the lane, responded when challenged by the runner up into the lane, could not match that one or the winner the final sixteenth, saved the show. WEST SIDE
GIRL lacked speed inside, continued to save ground second turn, improved a bit down the lane without posing a serious threat. XYLOPHONE off a step
slow, void of speed in trailing for six furlongs, improved position by passing tiring rivals through the stretch, also failed to seriously threaten.
ANNAGANGSTA within striking distance along the inside, had little left for the drive. MOHAYLADY never menaced with a three wide trip. RIGHT TRAPPE
prompted the pace off the inside for five furlongs, faltered when the real running began at the head of the lane.

Footnotes
GUN OF GOLD in the second flight off the inside,moved closer in the two path turn, bid, took over into the lane, shook clear, kept to task the final furlong.
JANE BOND broke in, was straightened to race forwardly lace the inside up the backstretch, crept closer early in the turn while remaining on the rail, in tight,
checked up soon after, fell back, split foes exiting the turn and finished willingly to be clear for the place, not a serious threat to the winner. HER NAME WAS
LOLA lacked early foot, raced through the turn in the three path, angled in for the drive and staged a belated rally to be just up for the show.
FROSTALICIOUS off a step slow, moved up to race in the second flight, steered three wide exiting the turn, had little left for the stretch run. NELLY TOO off
a step slow, trailed early as a result, angled out sharply to be four wide exiting the turn, improved position to the wire. OLD SCHOOL FLASH bumped at the
break, raced in mid pack and three wide, tired through the stretch. BLUE COWGIRL in mid pack while racing outside, roused four wide out of the turn,
lacked a closing response while remaining out in the middle of the strip. HAPPY HOLLOW bothered at the break, remained always back. BARGAIN
HUNTER broke in to bump an inner rival, was straightened to clear up the backstretch, moved to the inside a bit to tighten up the runner up early in the turn,
stopped when headed by the winner exiting the turn.

Footnotes
COMMUNICATION MEMO never far back off the inside, brushed with ITWASTHISBIG when moving closer three wide far turn, dueled into the stretch,
drove clear while drifting out. ROCKET AND ROLL took control after the start just off the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, responded when
challenged by the winner second turn and into the lane, proved no match the final furlong, remained clear for the place. PAPPY WOLFE off a bit slow,
dropped inside first turn, continued to save ground into the far turn, moved out a bit around a faltering rival, moved back inside and rallied for the show.
ITWASTHISBIG within striking distance in the two path, moved closer between the top tow into the far turn, fell back and dropped to the inside soon after
and finished flat to be caught for the show. CITIZEN off a step slow, moved up to mid pack along the inside, angled out to be three wide late in the final
bend, also came up empty for the stretch run. TEXAS PRIDE void of speed while four wide in the first turn, continued outside, three to four wide second
turn, improved position while not a serious threat. BACKSIDE BUZZ forwardly placed in the early going outside, tired in the drive. COMMANDER REX in
mid pack and three wide, failed to muster a rally. PIER PRESSURE void of speed, remained always back in also lacking a closing response. MANO DURA
well off the pace along the inside, weakened. ONCE UPON A DREAM stopped after a half, finished far back, jogged in. CONSTITUTION DAY in traffic then
steadied when lacking room into the first turn, also stopped after a half and jogged in as well. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE
RUN INTO THE FIRST TURN, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
SEIZE THE NIGHT last to leave, used to move up and show the way into the first turn, continued to show the way up the backstretch in hand, turned back a
pair of rivals through the final turn then drew out through the lane under steady handling. JOLLY TOMMY pulled while well off the early pace, continued
under restraint second quarter, angled five wide into the lane, rallied down the middle part of the strip to be clear for the place, not a threat to the winner.
TEN GAUGE within striking distance inside, continued in the second flight second turn, closest to the winner when straightened for home, also proved no
match and also could not contain the winner. FAIR DINKUM broke out, forwardly placed, moved closer three wide second turn, flattened out in the drive.
SPEED BIAS settled off the pace just off the inside, in the two path second turn, came up empty for the drive. FILM STAR bobbled then was in tight at the
start, moved out, four wide second turn, lacked rally. DEUS EX MACHINA chased the winner in the two path, bit closer second, gave way. GRANTHAM four
wide first turn when trailing, remained back and outside, four wide again in the second turn, no factor through the stretch while not being persevered with.
CARBONITE tired while racing outside.

Footnotes
ALLO ENRY within striking distance four wide, moved a bit closer late in the turn, lost some ground to the leader as a result, got back to that one late and
outkicked the runner up in a determined effort. STREET COMMANDER raced in mid pack early, five wide early turn, came four wide for the drive,
challenged outside the winner late, outkicked. SKYPED took command soon after the start, continued to show the way turn, cut the corner to be clear into
the lane, could not contain the top two late while inside that pair. KISSOFTHENILE broke alertly, pressed the issue in the two path for a half, began to
weaken entering the stretch. CLASSY SOCKS forwardly placed while racing three wide, had little left for the stretch. STORM STRATEGY broke back well
wide, five path through the turn, lacked a serious closing response. SIR PEEL off a step slow, went one paced while racing in the two path. DEVLISH HOUR
behind the leaders along the inside, tired in the drive. POINT BLANK bothered to be off slowly, failed to menace just off the inside. SALTY JONES in mid
pack inside, saved ground to no avail. FINBARFUREY off slowly, remained always back. ACCEL JOE outrun while racing four wide.
