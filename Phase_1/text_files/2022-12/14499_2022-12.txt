Footnotes
SUPER HUNK showed good early foot to set the early pace outside of foe and finished well to be clear late under strong handling. WATFORD stalked the
pace, moved up four wide between rivals past the three sixteenths pole and finished willingly to the wire. JUST AWESOME M was reluctant to load, raced
off the early pace, moved up two to three wide and finished willingly to the wire. ABETEMARCO chased the early pace from the outside of foes, raced six
deep into the upper stretch and flattened out. PARABELLUM dropped back early, raced five wide and lacked a rally. I AM THE JUAN pressed the pace from
the inside and faded. DIRT BIKE SLADE was off slowly, void of early speed, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened.

Footnotes
HALF COURT SAM was reluctant to load, stalked the dueling pair down the backstretch, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and just got up under all
out pressure. MORE FIREWATER dueled for the early lead from the inside, dug in and just missed in a game effort. FRANKS DEHERE was also reluctant
to load, race mid pack early on, moved up from the outside and surged late in a game finish. DIABOLICAL RULER dueled for the early lead from the outside
of foe and kept on willingly to the wire. OFFENSIVE raced off the early pace, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and moved up to improve
position. MAJORWAYHOME chased the early pace while racing three wide, angled out to race from the outside in the drive and raced evenly with no
closing run. STRYDER settled off the early pace, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and never threatened. MCTHANKS was off very
slow, raced with the second flight after the troubling beginning, raced three to two wide in the lane and threatened. COLOR ME GONE stalked the pace and
weakened while racing near the rail in the stretch run. SANTIAGO'S TOWER was off slowly, then veered to the inside soon after the start and unseated his
rider. A stewards inquiry was filed to review the start and deemed Santiago's Tower had fair chance at the break and no change.
