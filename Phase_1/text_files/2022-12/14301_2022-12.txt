Footnotes
VALIANTLY DISCREET was sent and soon clear, saved ground on the turn, was driven past the three sixteenths, and opened up further. READY MADE
was a bit keen early while securing a tracking spot outside of LOOKING SALTY, tracked the leader in the three path on the turn, pulled a bit in upper stretch
while proving no match for VALIANTLY DISCREET, chased on to the finish and kept finding enough to hold off ROCKET MAN ATTACK for place. ROCKET
MAN ATTACK broke outward and bumped ANUNKA in the opening strides, chased outside of LELAND JOHN down the back straight, chased well behind
the leading pair in the four path on the turn, proved no match for VALIANTLY DISCREET into the lane, kept on chasing, but could not reel in READY MADE
for the place. TEA WITH LEMON missed the break, trailed early, took closer order in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, and ran on
willingly while drifting out a few paths to prove best of the rest. ANUNKA was bumped by ROCKET MAN ATTACK in the opening strides, settled at the rear
of the main group, was pushed along in the two path on the turn, came four wide into the lane and ultimately only passed tiring horses. LOOKING SALTY
broke sharply but was outsprinted to the lead by VALIANTLY DISCREET, tracked the pace inside of READY MADE, was outpaced by the leading trio past
the half, chased midfield in the two path around the bend, went to a drive inside in upper stretch but lacked the needed rally. INSIDE THE CIRCLE was off
sharply inside of LOOKING SALTY but soon outpaced, continued to lose position in the two to three path on the turn and offered no bid in the lane. LELAND
JOHN chased near the rear inside of ROCKET MAN ATTACK early was asked near the three eighths and responded with a brief bid in the five path, was
driven in the lane in the six path and emptied out.

Footnotes
SUPERSTAR DIVA was sent inside but outsprinted to the lead by FLYING BUSINESS, tracked the pace inside of APRIL'S GEM, saved ground around the
turn, bid inside of the leader into the lane, loomed inside that foe past midstretch, finally wrested the lead near the sixteenth pole and edged clear. FLYING
BUSINESS shook out to the lead, raced clear in the three path on the turn, came two wide into the lane, was engaged by SUPERSTAR DIVA to her inside,
clung to the lead to the sixteenth pole but proved only second best late. HEY HEY chased behind the tracking flight down the back straight and in the three
to four path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, was driven through midstretch, and kept on for show while being shown the crop late.
PRANCIPANTS settled near the rear inside of IRISH HALO, raced in the four path on the turn inside that foe, came four wide into the lane, and showed
good interest in the final furlong but came on too late. WANNA HAVE FUN was shut off in the opening strides by APRIL'S GEM breaking outward, trailed
down the backstretch and in the two path on the turn, rallied inside horses but was outkicked late. IRISH HALO settled near the rear, raced in the five path
on the turn outside of PRANCIPANTS, swung five wide into the lane, chased on mildly but was ultimately outfinished. APRIL'S GEM broke out, tracked the
leader outside of SUPERSTAR DIVA, raced in the four path on the turn, was pushed along past the three eighths and driven four wide in upper stretch but
proved no match for the leading pair, chased to midstretch and weakened in the final furlong.

Footnotes
AWESOME SUNDAY was sent for pace inside of TU ROYAL, cleared past the eleven sixteenths, set the pace in the two to three path on the turn and into
upper stretch, opened up further under a drive and remained in command to the finish. YAMILE'S chased the leading pair inside of THEMISCHIEVOUSONE
early, edged forward and switched outside of TU ROYAL into the turn to track the leader in the four path on the turn, floated out to the six path in the lane
and kept on willingly to the finish for place. TU ROYAL broke inward and bumped MIDNIGHT SOCIETY in the opening strides, was sent between horses but
outsprinted by AWESOME SUNDAY past the eleven sixteenths, tracked the pace down the back straight, continued to track inside of YAMILE'S in the three
path on the turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, chased on but proved no match for YAMILE'S for the place in the final furlong. LUTION trailed down the
back straight and while saving ground around the turn, began to rally up the inside into the lane, went to a drive in upper stretch and sustained her rally to
the finish, hit the rail on the gallop out and unseated her rider, but was apprehended and walked off the course. MIDNIGHT SOCIETY was bumped in the
opening jumps by TU ROYAL and came a bit awkwardly back into stride, settled toward the rear outside of WICKED SKY, saved ground on the turn, swung
into the lane in the three to four path, chased to midstretch under a drive but flattened out in the final furlong. WICKED SKY settled near the rear inside of
MIDNIGHT SOCIETY early, raced near the rear in the three path on the turn, swung into the lane in the five path and lacked a rally.
THEMISCHIEVOUSONE chased outside of YAMILE'S on the back straight, flattened in the five path on the turn, swung into the lane in the six path and
continued to weaken.

Footnotes
JOLIE RULER led early, tracked COOKIN ROSES from the five eighths, tracked in the three to four path on the turn, swung into the lane in the five to six
path, reeled in the leader past the three sixteenths, and drove clear in the final furlong. COOKIN ROSES was sent for speed, led near the five eighths, set
the pace while clear in the two to three path on the turn, was driven in upper stretch but could not hold off JOLIE RULER from the three sixteenths, proved
no match for that foe in the final furlong but held the place. HER GOLD MINE chased inside of STERN down the back straight, was pushed along to chase
the leading trio in the two path on the turn, drifted out a few paths in upper stretch, proved no match for the winner but ran on willingly and missed the place.
PRINCESS CONSUELA was pinched back in the opening strides as a result of KITTEN ROCKS bumping STERN inward on her, settled at the rear, was
pushed along inside of STERN and KITTEN ROCKS while racing in the three path on the turn, improved in the three to four path in upper stretch, shifted out
midstretch, ran on with interest through the final furlong and missed the show. KITTEN ROCKS broke in and bumped STERN in the opening strides, was a
bit hard to settle while racing near the rear, raced in the six path with the rear flight on the turn, swung out near the center of the course in upper stretch, and
chased on mildly. AH LEAH tracked the leading pair down the back straight and in the five path on the turn, swung near the center of the track in upper
stretch and came up empty. STERN was bumped by KITTEN ROCKS in the opening strides and bumped into PRINCESS CONSUELA as a result, chased
outside of HER GOLD MINE early, was driven in the four to five path on the turn, swung into the lane in the six path, offered no bid and weakened.

Footnotes
RICHIESGOTSWAGGER chased outside early, tracked the leading trio in the five path on the turn, launched a bid from past the three eighths, engaged
outside the leading pair near the five sixteenths, came five wide into the lane, drove to the lead approaching the furlong pole and cleared. PRINCE OF
MAYHEM was sent for pace, took pressure from HIGH HERO to his outside down the back straight and while racing in the two path on the turn, was
engaged by RICHIESGOTSWAGGER further to the outside near the five sixteenths, carried a narrow lead into the lane, drifted out midstretch, was headed
approaching the furlong pole, continued in range to the sixteenth but proved no match late. AGAVE KID attended inside the leading pair early, tracked along
the rail around the turn, swung out for a bid and loomed between the leading flight in upper stretch, was put in tight near the furlong pole when PRINCE OF
MAYHEM drifted out, altered outside of RICHIESGOTSWAGGER, kept on with interest but missed the place. DEVIL'S RULE settled at the rear of the main
group, began a rally in the six path approaching the three eighths, came six wide into the lane, and chased on to prove best of the rest. THE LAST OPTION
settled at the rear, continued to trail in the four path around the turn, swung seven wide into the lane, and made belated improvement. MASTER GUNS
tracked the leading trio inside early, settled back inside the chasing flight in the two path on the turn, was driven for a rail bid into the lane, chased on to
midstretch but flattened out late. APPLICANT chased three wide between horses early, raced in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into upper stretch,
drifted out a few more paths and lacked the needed rally. RISKY BOY chased two wide between horses near the rear of the main pack, raced midfield in the
three path on the turn, came three wide into the lane, drifted in slightly in upper stretch, kept on evenly behind the leading line to midstretch and flattened.
HIGH HERO sent for speed, pressed outside of PRINCE OF MAYHEMP, attended in the four path around the turn and emptied out into the lane.

Footnotes
MISS RIVER RAT was settled between rivals dropping well off the leaders on the backstretch, shifted out four wide entering the turn gathering momentum,
shifted out advancing five wide between foes in upper stretch and produced a solid closing response to prevail under firm handling. LOVEYOULIKECRAZY
switched off the inside tracking just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, advanced on that foe on the turn to bid for command three deep between foes in
upper stretch, maintained a narrow advantage to late stages but couldn't fend off the winner. CANTOO tracked of the second flight between foes in early
stages, angled to the rail racing into the turn, saved ground advancing to contention in the stretch, tipped outside some tiring rivals to bid inside the
pacesetter in the final sixteenth but was outkicked by the top pair. JOYZELLA settled between foes in the last flight racing to the turn, made a steady gain
four wide between foes into upper stretch but was outkicked. CAT ROYALE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, shifted
out to lodge a brief bid between foes nearing the lane but came up empty late. PRIMITY settled outside foes racing to the turn and continued evenly three
wide between foes into the stretch while never a real threat. AIR GERRI, held up avoiding close quarters at the start, was fanned seven wide into the stretch
and made no impact. GO ON GIRL was urged to a clear off the rai in the opening quarterl, dueled for command on the turn into upper stretch and gave out
abruptly in the last furlong. MOM'S TOWN tracked off the first flight outside foes in the opening quarter, raced four wide on the turn while being prompted to
lodge a brief bid but gave way into the lane.

W W COOKIE MONSTER was urged inside rivals disputing the pace on a narrow advantage from the outset, edged forward to a narrow advantage racing
through upper stretch and was kept to firm encouragement to remain clear. W W SCOUT'S HONOR came through close quarters between rivals to gain
terms with the pacesetter prompting that rival through the backstretch, pressed the issue between foes into the lane but proved only second best. BOCA
BOY, in touch with the leaders three deep in the opening stages, pressed the pace in that path into the turn and faded in the drive. MARK OF THE Z was
rated tracking off the first flight four wide racing to the turn but lacked the needed closing response. LOCAMOTOR angled to the inside in early stages
tracking off the first flight to the turn but steadily retreated into upper stretch.

Footnotes
HATCHET CREEK tracked the pace inside rivals in second flight through the backstretch, made a steady advance on the pacesetter along the rail racing
into upper stretch, came through inside foes to wrest the advantage leaving midstretch and held the late charge of IRISH TUFF under firm handling. The
latter tracked the leaders four wide in second flight through the backstretch into the turn, angled five wide in upper stretch and continued with a steady effort
to challenge the winner nearing the wire. MOVE ON OVER, caught in tight quarters at the start, then held up in the opening sixteenth to drop out last,
angled to the inside racing into the bend, saved ground to upper stretch, gained contention inside foes leaving midstretch, tipped outside tiring foes to split
rivals three deep late but was outkicked by the top pair. CHOPPER was urged clear of the field racing a bit off the inside through the backstretch, held sway
on a clear margin into upper stretch but faltered in the final sixteenth. IMPERIAL MOMENT settled between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside
racing into upper stretch to gain some position late but was outkicked. WESTA WAVERLY tracked just off the pacesetter between foes racing into the bend
and faded into upper stretch. JUST RIGHT MIKE angled to the inside tracking just off the pacesetter on the backstretch, switched outside the leader on the
turn while being urged to close the gap but came up empty in the drive. MY LITTLE TIPSY, clipped heels at the start, was righted, then urged inside foes in
the opening furlong, was held up avoiding tight quarters nearing the five furlong marker, shifted out to race between foes on the turn to upper stretch but had
no closing bid. OLSON tracked off the second flight outside foes racing to the turn and faded early. RUBY'S RED DEVIL, refused to break despite prompting
from his rider, was soon outdistanced, then walked off the course under his own power following the race. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS
CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.
