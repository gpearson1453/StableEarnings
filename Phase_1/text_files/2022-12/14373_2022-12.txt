MR. CLUTCH stumbled leaving the gate, chased the top pair two wide around the bend, rallied inside the leaders and got up late. BEING BLESSED broke
in and bumped rival, went up to duel for command from outside then three wide on the turn, took a short lead in upper stretch, battled into the final sixteenth
and was overtaken by the winner late. EQUIPO A was antsy in the gate, showed speed from inside and dueled with BEING BLESSED, lost command past
the eight pole, fought back through the lane and finished gamely between foes late. FUN COUPONS tracked three wide around the bend, kept on to gain a
minor award but failed to threaten. PAUL L bumped leaving the gate, chased five wide around the turn and lacked a late bid. COME ON COME ON bumped
with rival at the start, angled down to the inside while at the back, saved ground from off the pace through the turn and could not rally. SAYERS got bumped
leaving the gate, chased four wide into the turn, came six wide into the stretch and had little left for the drive.

turn, moved into the three path around the bend, chased within range through the lane but lacked a late bid. SPRING SPINNING bumped in the beginning,
went four wide into the turn, moved into the three path for a bit before leaving the turn bend four wide, moved out in upper stretch and failed to rally.
FLATTERWITHJEWELS bumped with inner rival at the start, chased three deep between foes into the turn, two wide around the bend and faded in the

LOVE GONE WILD sped to the front and set the pace in the early going, opened up two wide on the turn then showed the way three wide into the stretch,
continued well clear into the final furlong, grew weary late but was able to hold on. WARREN'S SHOW BIZZ sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn,
tipped out and came five wide into the stretch, came with a late run but just missed. WORTHINESS got bumped and forced in leaving the gate, trailed early,
entered the turn two wide, steered out and exited the bend four wide, angled out in the stretch and gained the show. LA CHIQUIS chased four deep to the
stretch, bumped with GOLDEN HALO in upper stretch and could not rally in the final furlong. GOLDEN HALO chased three deep into and around the bend,
bumped with LA CHIQUIS in upper stretch, had the rider lose his whip at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened out. KEEPURSELF ALIVE chased between
foes, two wide into the stretch and failed to respond. ROUND IN CIRCLES got knocked into inner rival at the start, traveled two wide around the bend and
was not a factor. MISSING PENNY veered in and bumped rival, raced up close on the inside, started to weaken on the turn, tired in the lane, eased in the
final furlong and walked off.

Footnotes
CRYPTO RIDE bumped with inner rival at the start, settled early, went five wide into the turn, angled down to the three path then entered the lane four wide,
drew alongside the leader in the final furlong and inched ahead to prove best. STAY IN THE GAME raced up close on the inside then switched outside the
pacesetter, bid from outside and took over past the three-eighths pole, cleared inner rival leaving the bend, showed the way into the final furlong, challenged
from outside by CRYPTO RIDE and relinquished the lead at the sixteenth pole and stayed on for a clear second. THE LAST ONE PERK tracked widest up
the backstretch, went six wide into the turn, moved into the four path then exited the bend five wide, drifted inward in the lane and gained the show.
TRANSITORY bumped leaving the gate, stalked four wide into the turn, steered down to the two path around the bend, tipped out into the lane but got
hemmed in upper stretch, moved inward then drifted to the inside and could not rally. VINCE'S CORNER chased along the inside into the turn, moved out in
the lane and came up empty. EUSEBIO showed the way early then took pressure leaving the backstretch, lost command past the three-eighths pole,
chased the leader into the lane and gave way.

FRAZZLED broke out then went up to take control, led clear four then three wide on the clubhouse turn, opened up a comfortable lead, led two then three
wide on the far turn, put to right handed urging in the lane and won easy. WHISKEY BLUE settled on the inside, came off the rail on the backstretch, went
four wide into the far turn, was closest in pursuit three wide into the stretch, steered out in the lane, was unable to threaten the winner but was clearly
second best. AWESOME PAMELA bumped in the beginning, got floated out to the five path early on the first turn then moved back in some, angled in and
saved ground through the far turn, moved out in the final furlong and gained the show. SHEMAKESCENTS chased two wide early, three then two wide on
the far turn and lacked a late bid. I GIVE UP traveled two wide at the back into the first turn, along the rail into the second bend, tipped out and came three
wide into the stretch and failed to make an impact. ROMAN EMPRESS tracked three wide around the first turn, went five wide into the second bend, came
three wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. BACK ON THE STREET broke out and bumped rival, drifted out into the first turn, remained wide
through the second bend and tired.

four wide, put in late run but failed to reach the winner. MODERA sped to the front, challenged from outside at the three-eighths pole, relinquished the lead
at the five-sixteenths pole, churned on down the lane and got outkicked for the place. THE REIGN SONG got crowded between rivals early, went three wide
into the turn, pushed out to the four path by GOLDEN AGAIN and lacked a rally in the stretch. SMOKIN AMELIA chased two to three wide into the lane and

Footnotes
SILENT BEAUTY dueled for command on the inside, fought through the turn and into the stretch dug in the final furlong and inched ahead of VEGAS
DREAM and held in the end. VEGAS DREAM dueled for command outside SILENT BEAUTY, held a short lead to the stretch, lost the lead in the final
furlong, continued to fight on and held the place between rivals. YADIAMA got bumped in the beginning, chased three to four wide around the turn, finished
well outside the top pair while drifting in and missed the place. SUGAR SUGAR stalked off the inside, bid three deep into the stretch, fought into the final
furlong then faltered in deep stretch. TIGER'S WISH stalked the pace in the two path and never produced a bid. JAZZY BOO tossed his head and came
away very slow in the beginning, trailed up the backstretch, moved to the rail on the turn then came back out and entered the lane three wide and passed
tired rivals. MOONLITE IN HEAVEN got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, tracked two wide into the turn, angled five wide leaving the bend and failed
to menace. THE BIG CAKE broke out and bumped rival then got shuffled back in the beginning, traveled in the two path around the bend and came up
empty. HOP ON AND RIDE broke a step slow and dropped back early, went five then four wide on the turn, drifted out into the stretch and was not a factor.
