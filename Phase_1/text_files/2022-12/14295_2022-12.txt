Footnotes
TEA N CONVERSATION stalked three deep early, moved closer going through rivals on the backstretch, spun three wide into the lane, drew alongside and
bumped with VAGABOND PRAYER midstretch and kicked clear to win going away. VAGABOND PRAYER stalked three then two wide outside a rival, went
three deep into the far turn, took aim two wide into the stretch, bid outside with a furlong left to run, took over then bumped with TEA N CONVERSTATION
midstretch and yielded in the late stages. BOLT'S BROAD bumped in the beginning, raced on the inside well off the pace, lacked room through the far turn,
remained inside and found an opening leaving the bend, moved out in the lane and rallied for the show. AUTISM COMMUNITY was off a bit slow to begin,
reserved on the inside in mid-pack, hit the rail then bumped rival midway around the far turn, came three wide into the lane and kept on to earn a minor
award. CARSON JEN sped clear in the two path then moved inside, set all the pace to the stretch, challenged from outside at the eighth pole and gave way.
ANCIENT PEACE pulled and became rank early four then three wide, continued to race greenly up the backstretch, got bumped three deep midway around
the far turn, came five wide into the lane and never threatened. CANDY CARAMEL veered in and bumped rival, steered to the inside and pulled into the first
turn, moved closer leaving the backstretch, pushed on around the far turn and weakened. MAHINA was off very slow in the beginning, trailed two wide,
swung out into the stretch and was not a factor. ROSE ROSE ROSE got slammed leaving the gate, raced on the inside near the back, tipped out into and
upper stretch and failed to menace. BALENCIAGA BETTY pulled early stalking outside a rival, got bumped between rivals on the far turn, spun four wide
into the lane and weakened. PRINCESS MAGIC was off slow to start, raced in the two path off the pace, urged around the far turn two to three wide, shifted
inward upper stretch and came up empty. WIRLY GIRLY broke well and was up close to the inside of the leader then took a stalking position while switching
off the rail, raced between rivals into the far turn and got shuffled back at the five-sixteenths pole, chased two wide into the lane and faded.

Footnotes
PITTSBURGH sprinted to the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure then cleared past the nine-sixteenths pole, opened up on the far turn,
hand urged to the sixteenth pole and was geared down late. BATUKHAN (IRE) popped the gate open, was taken out and reloaded, got bumped from inside
and crowded at the start, tucked inside at the back, moved closer and was closest in pursuit while tipping out on the far turn, could not make any headway
on the winner in the lane and stayed on to secure second. INESPERADO chased five deep into the first turn, dropped back off the pace and remained
widest outside rivals, took the second turn four then five wide, had the rider lose her whip midstretch and could not get up for second. BIG BROTHER
tracked four deep then four wide on the first turn, went between rivals on the backstretch, angled to the rail on the far turn and failed to menace. LA'OCH
ALOYSIUS broke out and bumped rival, went up to press the pace from outside in the two path, failed to keep up with the leader past the nine-sixteenths
pole, continued two wide around the far turn and weakened. RUSTY B CAUSE chased three deep into the clubhouse turn, dropped back off the pace and
continued outside rivals, rounded the far turn three then four wide and lacked the needed response.

THRUMPS DREAM (IRE) stalked on the inside, waited behind the leader on the far turn, found an opening nearing the stretch, launched a bid along the
fence, took over outside the sixteenth pole and gamely prevailed. BUZZ OF NEW YORK (IRE) settled two wide then moved inside, had to wait for room in
traffic in upper stretch, steered to the inside for a clear path, rallied inside the top pair but was too late. MACADAMIA (BRZ) stalked three deep or three wide
early on, bid outside the top pair near the quarter pole, put a head in front in upper stretch, lost command nearing the final sixteenth and fought gamely three
deep to the wire. FREEDOM LASS stalked between rivals in the two path, tipped out in the lane and finished evenly late. ANGEL NADESHIKO bumped
leaving the gate, sped to the front and took control of the rail position, held a short lead around the far turn, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and
weakened in the furlong grounds. PHAROAH'S SONG was along the three path on the clubhouse turn tracking the pace, went three deep into the far turn,
came four wide into the stretch and failed to respond when called upon. EVER SMART was closest in pursuit settling in the two path, bid outside on the far
turn, vied between foes into the lane, got shuffled back in upper stretch and weakened. NEW HEAT was off a bit slow from outside, steered down to the
inside while trailing, moved out and took the second turn three then four wide and was not a factor. PULPIT RIDER also came away a bit slow, settled early
off the rail, traveled four to three wide on the clubhouse turn, went four deep into the second bend, spun five wide into the lane and failed to make an impact.
MALIBU MARIE broke a step slow and bumped leaving the gate, moved to the inside racing towards the rear, moved out and came three wide into the
stretch and was not a factor.

ARMY STAR pressed the pace outside the top pair, challenged three deep around the turn, took over late on the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and
drew away under right handed urging and steady handling. CROWNING GOLD went up to take a slim lead while dueling for command, vied with a pair of
rivals around the turn while losing the lead at the five-sixteenths pole, fought to the top of the lane then could not go on with the winner but stayed on to
edge rival for second. MISTER BEAMS dueled for the lead from outside, vied between rivals and took a short lead at the five-sixteenths pole, relinquished
the lead to ARMY STAR late on the bend, could not kick on with that rival in upper stretch and lost the battle for second. MERIT SONG drifted in near the
five-eighths pole bothering LET HIM DO, chased outside that rival at the back while three wide into the turn, moved down to the two path around the bend
and kept on for a minor award while never threatening. LET HIM DO bumped leaving the gate, got crowded between rivals at the five-eighths pole, chased
on the inside through the turn and failed to respond. FLAME RIDER broke out and bumped rival then ducked in shortly after, drifted out then lugged out on
the backstretch, rounded the turn four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
SPEAKING SCOUT was off a bit slow to begin, unhurried in the two path early on, coaxed between on the far turn and two wide into the lane, steered out in
the stretch, drew alongside SPYCATCHER in the final sixteenth and drove past. SPYCATCHER dueled outside a rival in the chute then stalked the leader
past the finish line first time around, applied pressure between rivals at the half-mile pole, vied for command around the far turn and took over past the
quarter pole, drifted out through the stretch and showed the way into the final sixteenth but was run down by the winner late and able to hold second. WIT
settled outside a rival then moved out three deep, angled five wide on the far turn and rallied widest in the lane but missed the place. HANDY DANDY
bumped lightly with inner rival at the start, stalked on the inside, moved out in upper stretch but got bumped and hemmed in by ST ANTHONY, kept on
under right handed encouragement and earned a minor award. CABO SPIRIT broke out and bumped rival, tracked inside then pulled on the clubhouse turn
and backstretch, tipped four wide on the far turn and failed to find the needed late kick in the furlong grounds. ST ANTHONY stalked outside a rival early on
then three wide, drew alongside the top pair at the half-mile pole, fought three deep on the far turn, lost touch with the leaders into the stretch, drifted in and
bumped HANDY DANDY near the eighth pole and faltered in deep stretch. EVAN HARLAN dueled inside SPYCATCHER leaving the chute, moved clear
past the finish line for the first time, gained company from outside at the half-mile pole, vied with rivals on the far turn and relinquished the lead late on the
bend, stayed on to midstretch then weakened late. SCRIPT got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, raced near the back and became rank fist time in
the stretch on the inside, was coaxed along on the far turn and cut the corner into the stretch and failed to make an impact. CLUTCH HITTER was off slow
to begin, reserved early on three then four wide on the first turn near the back, rounded the far turn four then three wide and lacked a rally. CELESTIAL
CITY was off slow and bumped between rivals at the start, raced two wide at the back early then moved out and went four deep into the clubhouse turn,
entered the far turn three wide, moved out five wide then exited the bend four wide and never got involved.
