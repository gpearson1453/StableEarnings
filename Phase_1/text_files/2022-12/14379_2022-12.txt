Footnotes
ARMSTRONG broke sharp to lead after the break, repelled an early challenger on his outside entering the turn, braced for a new contender to his right with
five sixteenths remaining, was nudged along the rail still up front turning for home and stubbornly was resilient on the fence to out game that rival through
the entire stretch for the photo victory. POULIN IN O T brushed his inside rival soon after the start, sat patiently three wide just off the flank of the contesting
duo down the backside, engaged the winner outside while well in hand with three furlongs from home, was head to head with the winner turning for home
and dueled outside the entire stretch losing the battle by a narrow margin at the wire. PARAMOUNT PRINCE broke outwards to start, tracked four wide the
front threesome at the half, took closer order to the leaders five sixteenths from the prize, was in range four wide at the top of the lane but could not threaten
the battling pair in the stretch run settling for a clear third. STUBBORN STREAK was unhurried to trail the compact field inside in the early stages, offered a
mild run shifting just outside with three eighths remaining to pass a tiring foe on the turn and could not gain on the top three through the stretch. ROLLING
HILLS was bumped lightly by his outside rival soon after the start, recovered to press for the lead with challengers on either side down the backstretch, gave
way while steadying mildly between horses nearing the three furlong marker and faltered at the quarter pole.

Footnotes
ROBITAILLE tracked from inside just off the leader, came out three wide, struck the lead in mid-stretch, edged clear a sixteenth out and held. DOC
FISHMAN reared up in the gate just a split-second before the gates opened with the starter still holding onto the reins to correct this action and
consequently spotted the field about five to six lengths, settled three to four wide toward the back early, advanced outside five wide, was gaining six deep in
the stretch but too late. WIN THE DRAW bumped a rival at the start, shifted in two wide heading into the first turn settling toward the back, advanced
between runners into the far turn, moved out five wide at the five-sixteenths, fanned eight deep into upper stretch, was gaining but too late. TREBUCHET
went three to four wide on the first turn stalking in behind the leaders, was within range in behind three wide on the far turn moving out five deep for the
drive, ran on evenly. HUSHEMUP moved forward while being kept off the rail to set the pace, raced mostly in the two path facing outside pressure from a
rival early up the backstretch, was overtaken in mid-stretch and yielded. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS was lightly brushed at the break, in a bit tight between
and behind rivals three wide into and on the first turn, advanced inside but in the two path on the far turn, ran on. GRAND GIZMO floated five wide into the
first turn moving forward to stalk the leader, moved in a path on that bend then edged closer to apply pressure early up the backstretch, came out a bit
turning for home and weakened. BEAUFORT was bumped into a rival at the start, angled in and saved ground on the first turn moving up closer to the
leaders inside, continued from inside on the far turn, had no late kick. BREACH OF TRUST rated just in behind the pace two to three wide and between
runners early, weakened. DREAMINGOF JEANNIE broke outwardly brushing a rival, shifted in trailing the field saving ground on the first turn, moved out
and advanced mildly outside four then five then six wide on the far turn before altering inside a foe past the quarter pole, had no rally thereafter.
MAHOGONY WILDCAT broke quite awkwardly, raced off the inside at the back and was never a threat. HE'S GOT SOUL was bumped at the start, caught
six then five wide on the first turn, stalked from mid-pack to the far turn, dropped back four wide on that bend and came up empty. FOLLOWING A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START IT WAS DETERMINED DOC FISHMAN DID NOT RECEIVE A FAIR START AND WOULD BE DECLARED
RUNNING FOR PURSE MONEY ONLY WITH ALL WAGERS ON THAT HORSE REFUNDED.

FASHIONABLY FAB broke well to be on top soon after the start, surrendered the lead to be in a good tracking position at the half mile marker, engaged the
frontrunner just outside midway on the turn, assumed command at the quarter pole and finished up determinedly to hold off challengers in the late stages of
the race for the victory. ME AND MY SHADOW stalked three wide racing down the backstretch, was coaxed along three deep to keep in touch with the
leaders on the turn, bid five wide at the top of the lane with dead aim of the winner but did not find another gear and could not close the gap through the
stretch. WITCH HAZEL broke inwards at the start, had a good rail position tracking behind the front pair on the turn, shifted three wide outside at the quarter
pole, was in contention between horses in the four path in upper stretch but could not gain on the winner running through the lane in a solid effort and had to
settle for a clear third in the end. SPEED TRAP trailed the compact field in the beginning, saved ground running through the turn, was urged for more run at
the quarter marker and showed some late energy to split tiring foes to get up for a minor share at the finish. ANAM CARA settled near the rear outside of
rivals down the backside, offered a little run three wide on the turn and stalled at the furlong marker. RIFLING was hustled early to get the lead at the half
mile marker, was headed outside with five sixteenths left to run, gave way on the rail two furlongs from home and retreated in the final sixteenth.

Footnotes
TAKE CHARGE GENT tracked off the pace from inside saving ground, bided time through the far turn, angled five wide leaving that bend, took aim, had
much to do but rallied strongly to just get up over GLORIOUS TRIBUTE, who settled outside the second flight four wide through the first turn, advanced
outside heading to the far turn, bid at the five-sixteenths taking the lead by the quarter pole, kicked clear but was just caught. MIDNIGHT RAMBLIN bobbled
at the break, raced three to four wide off the pace early, advanced five wide on the far turn reaching striking distance by the top of the stretch but evened
out. IT WORKED settled toward the back shifting in three to four wide heading to the first turn, still raced well back into the far turn moving outside rivals at
the three-eighths, went five to six deep on that bend, finished up strongly to improve position just nearing the wire. MORNING THOUGHTS stalked in behind
two to three wide, ran evenly and made no bid. RUNNINFORCOVER moved forward inside other rivals to set the tempo racing just off the rail, dueled briefly
late on the far turn then yielded. PERFECT PLAY switched outside a foe entering the first turn, moved back in to advance inside on the far turn, came out in
mid- to late-stretch for room and ran on but needed more. KLIMTOGLORY was in a bit tight at the start, raced four to five wide early, steadied on heels
slightly at the three-eighths moving outside at that juncture then back in a bit later on the second turn, failed to menace. SOCIAL JUSTICE shifted to the rail
entering the first turn, raced about mid-pack up the backstretch, went two wide on the far turn, was never near enough to threaten. HAYROLL shifted in two
to three wide and racing well back into the first turn, moved out six wide on the far turn, was asked for more at the five-sixteenths, went evenly in the stretch.
I AM RESILIENT raced two to three wide mid-pack off the leaders early, steadied on heels slightly past the three-eighths, was not a factor. JMR PURE
SENSATION pursued the early pace two to three wide and between runners in the second flight, came up empty for the stretch. LIARS CLUB was
forwardly-positioned outside runners near the lead four to five wide, faltered and faded. BAYTOWN ELVIS chased briefly four wide, steadily retreated.

Footnotes
EME CLAIRE broke sharp to dictate the pace down the backside, put away an early inside threat entering the turn, comfortably opened up on the field
racing at the quarter pole while in hand and cruised home unchallenged down the lane. MO TOUGH travelled near the back of the pack in the beginning,
was situated behind multiple runners in the four path turning for home, rallied inside on the fence at the furlong marker and closed belatedly to capture the
place award. CYMBAL COURT advanced nicely up the rail at the half to have a good inside position entering the turn, shifted just outside off a tiring runner
midpoint on the turn, angled out to the six path for the stretch run and raced greenly drifting in under a drive to get up for the show money. TWO
REDHEADS tracked the leaders with rivals on either side into the turn, was roused at the three furlong pole to keep pace with the frontrunning winner and
was one paced through the stretch to settle on the fringes. BORN TO BOOGIE sat three wide just off the pacesetting winner into the turn, took up the chase
with three furlongs to go, continued to persue in vain in mid stretch and faded at the eighth pole. TELLTALE broke inwards at the start, tracked four wide
outside foes in the second flight down the backside, took closer order to the leaders three wide racing on the turn, was in the mix for a share in the five path
at the top of the lane and weakened between rivals at the furlong marker. NAVY BLUE ANGEL was void of any early speed to be outrun racing down the
backside, trailed the pack on the turn, continued to see them all in upper stretch and passed weary stragglers down the lane. KANTBACKOFF settled in mid
pack between runners stalking down the backstretch, was ridden three wide midpoint on the turn, angled out seven wide at the top of the lane only to be
compromised by an inside rival in upper stretch and galloped to the wire in the final eighth. WORRY LESS was hustled early to press the issue inside in the
early stages of the race, began to give way on the rail five sixteenths from the wire and backed away through the field in upper stretch. STEWARDS

Footnotes
DOLCE SOPRESA was allowed to settle, advanced between runners three furlongs out, came past the quarter pole four wide with aim on the leaders,
moved out five to six deep at the top of the stretch, altered out a bit at the furlong marker to avoid a stricken foe without losing much momentum, dueled
outside a rival before edging clear. ATTABE tracked inside moving out two wide late on the turn, came out a little bit further in upper stretch then had to
check and alter course quickly to avoid a stricken foe, contended for the lead briefly but was outfinished. STOLEN settled off the pace, advanced between
foes past the five-sixteenths, gained inside in upper stretch then had to steady slight to avoid the stricken foe near the eighth pole, was no match for the top
pair. BEYOND REASON was urged at the break but lacking speed, raced on or just off the rail till the stretch, came out a bit and improved. ONDINE LADY
stalked three wide into and on the turn, began to weaken in upper stretch, steadied sharply and altered course to avoid the stricken foe and ran on. LADY
EVA raced outside off the pace three to four wide and failed to menace. NEOLITHIC NATION was taken hold of about the nine-sixteenths, dropped to last,
failed to threaten. MYTHICAL STORM chased briefly, dropped back shifting nearer the rail on the turn, steadied to avoid the foe at the eighth pole, pulled up
after that and walked off. GHOST D'ORO moved clear to set the pace shifting near but off the inside, widened in upper stretch, fell at the eighth pole, was
vanned off. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

Footnotes
GUNS N' ROJAS was allowed to settle near the back under a patient ride in the beginning, advanced up the rail into the turn, quickly began to pick up
horses when roused inside five sixteenths from the wire, angled out five wide for a clear path turning for home and was full of run late to win going away at
the end. RENEGADE SERENADE travelled near the rear with runners on either side down the backstretch, was steadied briefly at the seven sixteenths
marker, regrouped to gain on rivals inside through the turn, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, then dipped inside at the eighth pole and rallied to best
the rest. POSTURING trailed the field when steadied at the five furlong marker, was ridden four wide passing runners outside on the turn, angled out more
to the seven path at the top of the lane and closed in down the stretch to get up for the show money. FLOWERS 'N BERRIES travelled near the rear outside
in the beginning, commenced her run three wide at the three furlong marker, angled out to the five path rallying in upper stretch to contend and faded a
touch very late to be caught for the show award. HALF TO RELOAD pressed between runners for the front with four furlongs from the wire, dueled outside
for the top spot through the turn, shook clear at the top of the stretch, was collared with an eighth from the finish and faded in the late stages.
FORTYFIVESEVENTY was in the second tier tracking three wide, offered a mild run splitting runners midpoint on the turn to have a chance for a small
share turning for home and levelled off in mid stretch to a non factor in the late stages of the race. WAR'S END KISS tracked in the second flight on the
fence down the backside, was under a snug hold on the rail seven sixteenths from the finish and could not get involved last quarter racing between rivals.
SENSING HOLIDAY tracked in the two path with runners on either side with a half mile from the prize, slipped up the fence to be behind the dueling leaders
at the five sixteenth marker only to come up empty for the stretch drive. JAMIESTA dueled on the rail with a half remaining, fought on inside for the top spot
through the turn, started to tire on the fence at the top of the lane and retreated through the field with an eighth left to go. FAST'N SEXY pressed the pace
three deep down the backstretch, began to give way at the half mile marker, was scrubbed on to keep up between runners at the three furlong marker,
offered little effort and stopped between challengers at the quarter pole. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #9 POSTURING AGAINST #10 RENEGADE

Footnotes
HICKSY stalked from outside, travelled three to five wide throughout, edged closer leaving the turn taking the lead outside the three-sixteenths, moved clear
and was kept to the task. PRINCE OF THIEVES was bumped at the break, advanced between rivals about the seven-sixteenths then moved out, went four
wide early on the turn moving out six deep later on that bend and outside a rival, dueled with that one and got the place. KID FORESTER moved out from
three to five wide on the turn and asked for more at the quarter pole while advancing on the leader, fought on for the place but missed. BLUE MAX raced
toward the back three to five wide, kept on late to improve position. CHANCEL moved forward to set the pace racing off the inside in the two to three path,
weakened. GENDRAGON chased inside, failed to rally. INFAMOUS COVERT bumped a rival at the break, raced at the rear off the inside, swung eight
wide, failed to threaten. COPINSAY raced off the inside two to four wide throughout and was never near enough to threaten. SUPREMEACTION chased
from outside four to six wide, faded. ORPHAN HALLIE raced near the inside and failed to menace.

Footnotes
SONET'S NAME tracked just outside down the backstretch, began to reel in the pacesetter at the top of the lane, took command at the furlong marker when
roused and drew off in deep stretch. TUDOR PEAK settled in midfield on hold racing on the rail, continued to wait inside on the turn while in tight quarters at
the three eighths marker, found clear running room midpoint on the turn shifting just outside and was full of run in the lane to get up for the place award at
the wire. SPEED CHESS took command at the start, dictated the pace through the turn, was collared outside at the top of the stretch, gave way grudgingly
the final eighth and finished up with intent to be a clear third. FOREST VIXEN tracked four wide outside keeping the leaders in touch on the turn, took closer
order to the top pair at the quarter pole to loom three wide turning for home only to finish one paced down the lane to settle for a minor role. LADY XI raced
between rivals in the middle of the pack down the backside, was ridden for more five sixteenths from the prize, could not quicken with rivals and made little
impact through the stretch. JIMMY IS A BREEZE had a good spot on the rail waiting behind the top pair four furlongs from the line, was in hand waiting
inside on the turn, was asked to rally up the fence two furlongs from home, offered a mild run and faded on the rail in the stretch. SPIRIT O'TIPPERARY
settled close to back of the pack entering the turn and offered some run inside with five sixteenths left to go to pass weary runners in upper stretch.
SQUEEZEMETOTHEMAX was brushed by an inside rival on the break, settled in the middle of the field four wide with a half mile remaining in the race,
continued four wide through the turn and could not make any impression racing to the finish down the lane. MURDER HORNET broke outwards on the start,
rated in mid pack between rivals at the half, was asked for more run three wide midpoint on the turn and was not a presence in the late stages of the race.
T'PRING was situated near the rear in the early stages, was urged by her rider three wide on the turn and offered little run down the stretch. DANCING FOR
MONEY was steadied midway down the backstretch to trail the field, saved ground inside on the turn and could not make any impression racing to the wire.

Footnotes
SEATTLE CAUSEWAY shifted in early, advanced on the leading trio saving ground on the turn, angled five wide turning for home, struck the lead past the
sixteenth pole and held a rival. SIXTOFIVE brushed a rival at the start, settled into stride off the pace, advanced inside rivals midway on the turn, shifted out
after that, came into upper stretch seven wide, gained strongly but then couldn't get to the winner but was second best. SOUPER SUNDAY set the pace
racing off the rail, proved no match for the top pair. SECRET SUNSHINE bumped a rival at the start, switched off the inside, advanced two then four wide on
the turn, gained willingly without late urging. AGENDA was bumped at the break, raced off the pace near the inside, came out in upper stretch, ran on.
PANIC SWITCH raced off the pace going three to four wide on the turn, passed tired rivals. STRIKE THE POSE pressed the pace going three wide into the
turn, came up empty. SPARKLING SILVER stalked the leaders early, moved about three furlongs out to press outside four wide, came up empty. FLAT
OUT ANGEL broke slowly, raced off the inside and made no impact. RUMOURS FLY was ridden along five wide into the turn and came up empty. LOADED
MISTRESS chased three wide, retreated.

Footnotes
ANALYZER chased the frontrunner down the backstretch, kept his sights on the leader racing through the turn, took command at the top of the lane, dug in
on the rail under left handed urging and held off the closers in deep stretch to get the victory. D'S BEN chased behind the pacesetter down the backside,
was shuffled back a touch inside on the turn, regrouped three wide between rivals in upper stretch and was gaining with every stride on the leader down the
lane but ran out of room. HIGH HEAT had a good position outside keeping the leaders in range with three furlongs to run, loomed four wide turning for
home, chased in vain down the stretch but could not close the gap and had to settle for third. PERLARANA was on hold behind challengers running on the
rail throughout the turn, angled out for clear path six wide turning for home and finished up well with good energy all while on the wrong lead to get up for a
minor share. BIG LEAGUE made an early move advancing inside on the rail at the five furlong pole, angled outside off a tiring foes with three eighths left to
run, was in contention five wide for the stretch drive and stalled with a sixteenth to the wire. THELONIOUS had a good rally on the rail starting three furlongs
from home, was in with a chance for a small award at the top of the stretch but needed more late to threaten for a good placing. DUKE OF MIAMI was
situated near the back in the beginning stages of the race, put in a mild run between foes three furlongs from the finish, was ridden hard inside midway
through the turn, weaved his way through rivals angling outside seven wide at the top of the lane and continued to try passing horses late. CORRELATE
was situated near the rear three wide down the backside, was roused racing widest throughout the turn, angled out in the eight path for the drive and was
empty for the stretch run. KITTEN'S BOY was steadied on the rail appearing to lose his path at the three eighth marker and could not recover in time to be a
factor in the late stages of the race. I'M A CHI TOO travelled in the middle of a large strung out field at the half, was asked for more run midpoint on the turn
and never reached contention racing to the finish. BEYOND MY DREAMS trailed the field on the rail at the five eighths pole, was steadied sharply at the
three furlong marker, began to rally in upper stretch inside but encountered more traffic issues in mid stretch and could never offer a serious run. OMEGA
MOON took command from the outside to clear the field getting to the rail with a half remaining, continued to be up front throughout the turn, was collared
outside by the winner at the quarter marker and backed away quickly stopping the final eighth. EXECUTIVE GIANT was away slowly to trail in the
beginning, started to go around foes four wide at the seven sixteenths marker, angled out to be five wide entering the stretch, could not sustain his run and
ran out of steam in mid stretch. COWARDLY ACT track widest in the four path down the backside, began to get leg weary losing position to rivals into the
turn, gave way and was not persevered with galloping across the wire.
