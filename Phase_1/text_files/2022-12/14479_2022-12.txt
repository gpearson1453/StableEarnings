OCEAN RIDE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, led the way while racing in the two path around the turn and held that margin to the wire.
ALMASHRIQ tracked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path and chased the winner to the
wire. CAMPTOWN RACES dueled on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back to chase the leader while saving ground around the bend and kept on to
the finish. ODDS ON hopped up leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path,
swung wide entering the stretch and was not a threat. SHED A TEAR trailed the field on the inside early, raced between horses in the two and three path
around the turn and was empty in the stretch. POLLOCK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and
tired in the lane. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START OF THE RACE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER
OF FINISH.

Footnotes
DREAMING OF SNOW led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn and drew off
down the lane while drifting mildly late. YES DAY trailed the field on the inside early, improved position while racing in the two path around the turn and
continued to gain ground down the stretch while proving to be no match for the winner. DANCE STEP bumped with the horse to her inside leaving the gate,
settled off the pace between horses for the run up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and improved position mildly in the final furlong.
PACHANGA LOCA stalked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around bend and faded in the lane. GIRL
AFRAID bumped mildly with the horse to her outside at the start, chased the frontrunners up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and weakened
in the stretch. A NITE IN CAIRO raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening stages, dropped back to trail the field from the two path
around the turn and was empty from there.

EXACTING led the way while saving ground through the opening half mile, raced in the two path around the far turn and dueled down the stretch to hold the
victory. I AM THAT I AM raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the leader between horses up the backstretch, continued around the far turn
still in the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and dueled down the lane, narrowly missing, the best of the rest. WATCH FOR THE LUTE
raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position in the lane
but was no match for the top two. MAPACHE G was bumped by FELIX THE FOX and carried out to the five path racing around the first turn, settled at the
back of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the three path, swung wide into the lane and improved
position mildly to the wire. EPIC RUN saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the second
bend in the two path and weakened in the lane. NOICATTARO trailed the field on the inside early, came around the far turn in the two path and was empty
in the stretch. ACTION WARRIOR raced in the three path through the opening quarter of a mile, chased the frontrunner on the outside up the backstretch,
dropped back while saving ground around the far turn and faded further in the stretch. FELIX THE FOX raced into traffic and bumped with MAPACHE G
headed into the first turn, switched to the outside and improved position headed up the backstretch, came around the far bend in the three path and tired
from there.

quarters and steadied slightly, dropped back headed into the stretch, found his stride again and gained ground late to the wire. MY BATON ROUGE raced in
the two path early, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, challenged approaching the quarter pole,

Footnotes
RED CRESCENT bumped lightly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the four
path coming around the turn and edged clear late. BUMPERDOO trailed the field through the opening three furlongs, navigated the turn from the three and
four path, began a bid nearing the quarter pole and gained ground in late stretch. FLUID SITUATION dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to
battle from the three path around the turn and in upper stretch and weakened while drifting mildly in the final sixteenth of a mile. KING OF HOLLYWOOD
raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn in the four path and made no bid. WHISTLEWHILEYOUMOW dueled between horses through
the opening half mile, gave way while racing in the two path around the bend and faded further in the lane. INTER MIAMI bumped mildly with the horse to
his outside at the start, recovered to duel from the rail up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. SUPER CURIOSO (ARG)
pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, pulled up coming around the turn and was vanned off.

Footnotes
TAP DANCE FEVER raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch at the back of the pack, began a bid from the rail coming
around the far turn, drifted out and brushed lightly with CAFE SOCIETY near the eight pole and pulled clear from there. CAFE SOCIETY hit the gate and
bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, saved ground in the middle of the pack through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn from the three
path, challenged in upper stretch, was bumped by TAP DANCE FEVER when that rival drifted into his lane and kept on to the wire. VILLAGE QUEEN raced
in the three path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the five path and
gained ground late. ALL GOOD TIMES raced off the pace in the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the
far turn and improved position mildly in the lane. CHARGE ACCOUNT hit the gate leaving it, raced in the four path around the first bend, trailed the field up
the backstretch, came around the far turn in the five path and never threatened. MISS MIKAELA chased the leader from the four path around the first turn
and up the backstretch, moved up to duel from the four path around the second bend and faded in the stretch. BAYOU WIND led the field while saving
ground through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around the far turn and tired in the lane. SOUTHERN SMILE raced in the two path early,
settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up the backstretch, began to drop back while racing in the two path around the far turn and was
empty from there.
