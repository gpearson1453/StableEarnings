GIRLFROMOUTERSPACE settled wide at the back of the pack, advanced on the final turn, took over into the stretch and drew away. DIVINARY raced
close up three wide, led briefly at the quarter pole then proved no match for the winner. DANA'S BIG DAY reserved between rivals, bid inside on the final
turn then weakened. TEMPTED TO TOUCH slipped through inside to challenge after half a mile, came out under left handed whip and steadied tiring near
the eighth pole. ELEVENMONTHSLATER prompted the pace outside for three quarters and faltered. ACQUA BELLA set a pressured pace inside, stopped
abruptly and was eased through the stretch. The stewards posted an inquiry into the stretch run and the fourth finisher claimed foul against the second
finisher but it was dismissed.

Footnotes
WIZARD SERRAT raced off the pace, advanced on turn, angled out, rallied three wide into the stretch, closed steadily outside, surged in deep stretch and
was clear under the wire. I SAW IT ALL stalked outside, chased on the turn, rallied on the rail in the final furlong, bid, dug in gamely and came up second
best. CAPE HEDGE was off a bit slow, raced off the rail, off the pace, raced three wide on the turn, closed well late outside and got third. MASROUR set the
pace racing in the two path, shook free on the turn, dueled past the eighth pole and dug in to the end. INSTANT CHAOS stalked the pace, chased on the
turn, rallied outside, bid in midstretch and was outkicked. VERO SUN was outrun early and closed belatedly inside. BOOM BOOM KABOOM tracked close
up on the inside, chased inside on the turn and tired. ABDAA raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. LAWLESSNESS raced off the pace inside
and did not factor.

NO SYMPATHY pursued the loose pacesetter, faded into the stretch then came again driving through the final furlong. MY CORALENA hustled to a clear
advantage, widened in midstretch then weakened in the last eighth of a mile. CINNAMON DREAM faded before half a mile, advanced inside and closed well
narrowing the gap. A BIT BAD N BOUJEE lacked speed, moved wide and never menaced. ANOTHER SAUCY SIX saved ground close up then gave way
readily. DON'T B RIDICULOUS raced within range for half a mile then stopped. ARDEAN weakened steadily losing contact with her field.

Footnotes
PINE VALLEY prompted the pace outside, bid on the turn, led into the stretch and edged clear while kept to a drive. NORTH BAY forced the pace inside,
was taken up lacking room at the top of the stretch, angled out and rallied to be easily second best. BURN THE EVIDENCE hustled to the front inside,
dueled the winner to the stretch and tired. VIRAL VIDEO was far back early inside then offered some late energy. TITANIUM RECKAGE chased very wide
while racing greenly and was no factor. THREETHIRTYTHREE raced in the two path off the leaders and weakened steadily. MR. AGALLAS lacked speed
and was never in contention. CARPE ALL DAY moved up on the rail down the backstretch then stopped abruptly.
