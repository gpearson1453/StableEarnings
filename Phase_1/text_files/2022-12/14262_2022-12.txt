Footnotes
MULLINGAR broke out and bumped soundly with a foe, went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied in the two path around the turn,
responded well when put to a right-handed crop in upper stretch, extended the advantage into the final furlong, was placed under a hand-ride outside the
sixteenth-pole and eased up late while much the best. OUTLAW COUNTRY broke in then bumped soundly with a rival and was off a step slow, moved up to
press the pace on the outside of the leader, vied in the three path around the turn, chased under a drive into upper stretch and proved no match for the
winner while able to get the place. NIEUWENDYK showed speed on the outside then chased the pace, went around the turn in the four path, brushed with a
foe in upper stretch and weakened while clear for the show. PRACTICALLYMINE broke in then was corrected with a tug of the right-rein and was off a bit
behind the top two, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted inward inside the three-sixteenths
and came up empty. DON'T LET ME DOWN was bumped soundly on both sides at the start and off a bit slow, settled at the rear, moved out outside the
half-mile pole then dropped back in before leaving the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path under strong urging, was driven four wide into the
stretch then tipped out more and brushed with a foe, moved in inside the furlong marker and came up empty.

Footnotes
MONEY MIKE chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to
collar the leg weary leader in the final jumps to the finish. IKIGAI broke out at the start bumping FUNNY JOKE, established the front shortly after the start
and showed the way in hand three then two wide, widened away through the latter portion of the turn and spun just off the inside into upper stretch, got
roused at the three-sixteenths, dug in growing leg weary near the sixteenth marker and was caught in the late stages while safely preserving the place
honors. COUSIN ANDREW seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the
three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. FUNNY JOKE got bumped at the start by IKIGAI, chased three wide
until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid. KING
JAMES coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, kept on to the finish but was
out-finished in the late stages. HAGLER coaxed from the start, chased six then five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide for home
and weakened.

Footnotes
GAME THEORY bumped with a rival at the start, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path around the turn, was set down into upper stretch,
responded well under heavy threat in the drive and held gamely. TRIPLE P was eased back between foes then settled on the outside, went four wide on the
turn, was roused late on that bend, gained to make a bid outside the eighth-pole, fought outside of the winner in the final furlong and just missed while clear
for the place. LONDON GOLD was well placed just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked late on that bend, chased the winner in
the stretch and was out-kicked while able to get the show. HIGH SCHOOL CRUSH was urged along off the pace, went four then three wide on the turn,
came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick. GRIS TORMENTA settled off the pace, dropped back while moving from the three path to the
rail on the turn, came out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed response. MORE MANGO disputed the pace on the inside of the winner,
vied along the rail while still inside that foe around the turn, passed the five-sixteenths under urging, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. MEBS
WEB bumped with a rival while off a bit slow, was urged along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the six path, dropped to the four path at the
quarter-pole and was no factor. CARLY HUSTLE dropped back under urging, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond.

Footnotes
GIMMEBACKMYBULLETS showed the way in hand just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole when under some challenge from
REUNION TOUR advancing outside, swung three wide into upper stretch and drew off under a drive to prevail. REUNION TOUR four wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths and advanced on the aforementioned foe, angled five to six wide into upper stretch, proved no match for that rival while
along well clear of the rest and second best. MAKART got bumped at the start by RED JET, who broke outwards, chased three wide under coaxing from the
three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. RED JET broke out at the start bumping MAKART, chased three then two wide
under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. SALTY HEIR chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the
turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and gave way. SENSE A GIANT chased along the inside under
coaxing from the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home to the finish. MAYTHISBETHEONE tipped out just
after the start to chase four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three to four wide through the turn and was placed to coaxing midway,
went four wide into upper stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CARAGATE was taken in hand briefly when losing her lane at the start as BUSTIN BAY came over, tipped out and chased eight paths off the inside down
the backstretch, tucked inside near the half mile pole and came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, advanced and went six to seven wide into upper
stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong collaring the leader with seventy yards to the finish and inched away to the end. SWEET
MYSTERY five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four to five
wide into upper stretch, took command straightened away, dug in under threat and was caught seventy yards from home, ran on to secure the place honors
clear of the rest. GOLDEN ROCKET eight to nine paths off the inside down the backstretch, went five wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, took over narrow and brief command swinging six wide into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away and weakened in the late
stages. BUSTIN BAY hustled from the gate, raced three wide briefly before tipping out to the six path down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the
turn, went eight wide into upper stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. SISTER LINDA dueled from the two path with COURAGEOUS GIRL to her
outside, came under coaxing at the three-eighths and shook off her main pace foe confronted by a pair through the latter portion of the turn, yielded the front
and went just off the inside into upper stretch, then weakened in the late going. BYHUBBYHELLOMONEY seven paths off the inside down the backstretch,
tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight to nine wide into upper stretch and offered no kick.
COURAGEOUS GIRL hustled from the start, led early on before dueling four then two wide with SISTER LINDA to her inside, retreated through the latter
portion of the turn and went three wide into upper stretch, then tired in the drive.

Footnotes
TAP THE FAITH broke a step slow then was taken up, settled at the rear, moved closer midway down the backstretch, was roused in the two path on the
turn, rallied three wide into the stretch, gained to make an outside bid nearing the furlong marker, took the lead at the sixteenth-pole and prevailed under
good handling. MISSY GREER moved in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage in the two path through the turn, was asked
turning into the stretch, came under threat outside the furlong marker, led to near the sixteenth-pole then was overtaken while able to hold the place.
TONED UP was urged along on the outside, went four then three wide on the turn, moved out while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch, gained in
the process, swapped to the proper lead while chasing the top two nearing the furlong marker and finished willingly to just miss the place while well clear for
the show. HOODOOLAND came inward at the start then was hustled, angled out inside the seven-eighths, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased
in the there path around the turn and tired. FAR AWAY LOVE (ARG) was carried out inside the three-quarter pole, settled on the outside, was asked to pick
it up near the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn, was taken well out into the track while faltering into upper stretch and was eased in the final furlong
but walked off.

Footnotes
RUSSIAN TO WIN grew a bit fractious in the gate and tossed his head as the latch was sprung lunging awkwardly at the start and conceding four to five
lengths to the front before being able to settle into stride, tucked to chase three wide down the backstretch before making his way to the rail into the turn,
came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out seven wide into upper stretch, rallied with good courage to issue a challenge through the final
furlong taking command a sixteenth out and edged clear to the finish kept to task. VOLIERO chased briefly inside before tipping to the two path, came under
coaxing along the rail three furlongs from home, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the eighth pole, dug in under threat
and was collared a sixteenth out, ran on to preserve the place honors. FOREVER WICKED chased two to three wide under coaxing from the
seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and ran on to secure the show honors. DONTBELATE vied two to three wide with a pair before
emerging to duel from the two path into the turn with SPECTATORLESS to his inside, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and yielded
near the eighth pole, then weakened in the late stages. THE MET six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming
under coaxing at the three-eighths, went eight wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. SPECTATORLESS vied inside a pair down the
backstretch before dueling with DONTBELATE to his outside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, then weakened in the drive. SUPER WICKED CHARM eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn and came
under coaxing three furlongs from home, went nine wide into upper stretch and offered no response. MR. BRIGGS five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went two to three wide through the turn and then four wide into upper stretch and tired. R BOY CHEEKUM seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, tipped six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. LOADED JOE
vied from the four path with a pair to his inside down the backstretch until shaken off with nine-sixteenths to run, chased in closest aim of the duel into the
turn before fading under coaxing through the bend, cornered four to five wide into upper stretch and folded, then got eased home to the finish.
