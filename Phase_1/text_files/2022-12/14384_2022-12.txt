Footnotes
ZYDECO MUSIC tracked three wide, loomed a danger while ranging up to the clear leader with three furlongs to go, bid while well in hand at the five
sixteenths pole, then kicked away in upper stretch, and drew off under driving pressure. GALAXY THIRTYSIX laid off of the pace along the inside, tipped to
the four path and between horses in upper stretch, then shifted further out at the furlong grounds, and rallied on her left lead through the late stages to reach
an inner foe for place at the wire. OURPERFECTPRINCESS chased two wide, drifted to the six path in upper stretch, sustained stride while hanging on her
left lead to bid for place in the final furlong, gained that position while shifting inwardly at the sixteenth pole, then got caught at the wire by an outer rallying
rival. ROCKETT MAGIC chased along the inside, shifted to the three path while failing to keep pace with an outer chasing counterpart in upper stretch, then
was outkicked again by another outer foe in the final furlong before surpassing a tiring rival to regain a minor placing. ANGELA'S CELERITY lacked speed
three wide, drifted to the four path at the five sixteenths pole, then got floated to the five path in upper stretch, and failed to mount a rally. SEE SASSY RUN
raced at the rear two wide and between horses, trailed around the turn, cut the corner nearing the lane, and made little impact. PUZZLING PRIORITY
rushed clear in the opening stages, was confronted by the eventual winner nearing the five sixteenths pole, proved no match leaving the quarter pole, and
weakened.

Footnotes
Z RESURRECTION set the pace, felt stern pressure from a pair of hounding outer rivals around the turn, shook free of them at the sixteenth pole, and drew
clear. SLICK AND FAST tracked along the inside, shifted to the five path nearing the lane to be outside of the top trio entering it, then stayed on well,
chased the clearing leader while inching closer to place through the final furlong, and reached that position late. KAJUN KARMA pressed three wide, vied
around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his innermost counterpart at the three sixteenths pole, chased into deep stretch, but lost place in the closing
stages. RIGHTEOUS FREEDOM prompted the pace two wide and between horses, vied around the turn, but failed to keep pace with his inner competitor in
upper stretch, and yielded. PESO PESADO broke slowly, raced at the rear along the inside, improved turning for home, gradually shifted out through upper
stretch, but lacked a rally. VETERANS DAY bumped with an outer rival at the start, stalked four wide, required constant urging to keep pace around the turn,
then faded while being floated to the six path entering the lane. SKIPPA bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, swung out
turning for home to come into the lane in the seven path, and made little impact. THOMAS DAVIS broke out at the start, tracked five wide, but fell after
sustaining an injury at the three furlong pole, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
LATE SEPTEMBER broke well before shifting in slightly soon after the start, prompted the pace two wide, vied around the turn, kicked clear at the quarter
pole, drew off in upper stretch, and held sway through the late stages an an outer rival narrowed the advantage. TUMBARUMBA took a bump from an inner
rival at the start, then was jostled when bumped by foes on both sides soon after, trailed the field in the aftermath, improved three wide around the turn,
rallied between horses to claim place nearing the furlong grounds, and continued to steadily close in on the clear leader late. CALICOCO tracked two wide
before clearing an inner rival approaching the turn, pursued the leaders from the two path, tipped outside of them entering the lane, but lacked the needed
kick to produce a bid, then was outkicked by an inner rival for place in midstretch, and kept on. THE BOSS SOSS bumped an outer rival at the start, then
bumped that foe again in the early stages, raced off of the pace two to three wide, and moved up in the final furlong. RANCH WATER laid off of the pace
along the inside while under steady coaxing to keep interest, saved ground, but to no avail, then shied when uncomfortable between horses at the sixteenth
pole. NOT ON HERB was herded inward slightly soon after the start causing him to bump an inner foe, chased outside of the top pair under constant urging,
and caved while floated four wide nearing the lane. HALF FULL set the pace inside of a vying rival, but failed to keep pace turning for home, and gave way.
THE RIDER OF TUMBARUMBA CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF LATE SEPTEMBER FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE OPENING STAGES;
BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
FREE DROP MADDY vied along the inside, inched clear while shifting out to the three path at the three furlong pole, came into the lane in the five path,
maintained a clear margin through midstretch before meeting NORAH G's rail challenge a sixteenth from home, shifted in to engage, and held tenaciously.
NORAH G broke a step slowly at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, pulled forward to await room behind rivals at the five sixteenths pole,
remained behind traffic entering the lane before diving to the rail for clear sailing leaving the quarter pole, responded readily to produce a rail rally in upper
stretch, took aim inside of the clear leader in the final furlong, bid entering the final sixteenth, but was gamely staved off through the closing stages.
TENSAS CANDY tracked along the inside, gained place while leaning out and shifting off of the rail entering the lane, but allowed for rail racing room for an
inner rival in the process, got outkicked for place by that foe at the three sixteenths pole, then held show through the final furlong. LOUISIANA COWGIRL
took a nudge from an inner rival at the start, stalked three wide, got floated to the five path at the three furlong pole, then chased while slowly giving way
through the lane. ADDI BUG raced in midpack three to four wide, shifted to the six path at the three furlong pole to remain outside of the leaders, then faded
while hanging on her left lead. DON'TCALLMEPATSY lightly bumped an outer rival at the start, set the pace outside of a vying rival, proved no match for
that one while being floated to the four path at the three furlong pole, got brushed by an inner place-bidding rival entering the lane, and yielded between
horses while hanging on her left lead in the final furlnog. LOUISIANA LIBERTY chased from midpack two wide and between horses, but faded turning for
home. STARSHIP JAMBALAYA raced at the rear two wide while in the three to four path around the turn, shifted in in upper stretch, but made little impact.

and was second best. SPIRITED BEAUTY broke out at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter, but lost place while floated out a path by an inner rival
entering the lane, and gave way. SNOWBALL trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DIXIE STREET stalked three wide, engaged the leader two wide entering the turn, bid at the five sixteenths pole, drew clear while well in hand in the four
path in upper stretch, and was ridden out under light hand urging through the final furlong. SECRET VISTA broke a beat slow at the start, stalked four to
three wide entering the turn, chased the clearing leader in upper stretch, shifted inwardly while gaining place at the furlong grounds, and safely managed
that position thereafter. ALTERANA bumped the outer part of the gate while off two lengths slow, raced far back in the two path, searched for racing room in
upper stretch, dove in at the furlong grounds to commit to a newly-vacated rail charge, and surpassed outer rivals late to gain show in the closing stages.
GOLDEN PALACE tracked along the inside, altered course outside of a rival and to the three path at the furlong grounds, but lacked a kick between horses.
CRYPTOZONIC trailed, shifted out seven wide in upper stretch, and moved up outside of foes in the final furlong. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT pursued from
midpack along the inside while a bit off of the rail, shifted to the three to four path at the quarter pole, but lacked a bid while chasing between horses. MR.
PRODUCTION sped clear early on, met a challenge from the eventual winner approaching the five sixteenths pole, proved no match entering the lane,
weakened, then faltered between horses in the closing stages. RECKLESS RANSOM lacked speed in the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch
and lacked a rally.

Footnotes
A G'S CHARLOTTE tracked in the three to two path and between horses around the first turn, bided time just behind the leaders around the far turn, cut the
corner entering the lane to slip inside of the pace setter at the quarter pole, powered through tight quarters while being bumped by that rival to wrestle
command at the three sixteenths pole, but failed to kick away her outer game counterpart, sparred tenaciously through the final furlong, and clung to her
advantage to the wire. WINNING ROMANCE set the pace in the two path as an outer rival applied pressure, showed the way from a pair of outer bidders
turning for home, shrugged them off entering the lane before meeting a stern challenge from a rail bidder leaving the quarter pole, shifted in slightly to create
tight quarters for that rival approaching the three sixteenths pole, got headed while bumping at that juncture, then fought on determinedly thereafter, but was
staved off late. FORT POLK tracked in the five path, ranged up in the four path around the far turn to bid for the lead outside of a pair of rivals turning for
home, but failed to keep pace with the embattled leading pair in upper stretch, and kept on to maintain show. WHOLELOTTAMO lunged outwardly while off
a step slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, trailed around the far turn, improved between horses entering the lane while shifting out to the five path, and
stayed on. CHEAPSKATE DIVA pressed outside of the leader while kept in the three path by that foe, bid for the lead along with an outer rival turning for
home, but yielded foes on each side leaving the quarter pole, and gave way. LUTIE MO laid off of the pace two wide, failed to truly progress while taking the
far turn in the four to five paths, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and flattened out. SHE'S GONE D'WILD stalked the top pair from the four path and
between horses, then faded turning for home. EVE'S DELIGHT stalked along the inside, but faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
TOUCHUPONASTAR set an uncontested pace while well in hand, met an outer rival's bid at the five sixteenths pole, was briefly headed nearing the lane,
but responded readily when let out a notch at the quarter pole, quickly repelled his outer rival, opened up in upper stretch under moderate urging, and was
put to wraps approaching the final sixteenth. BEHEMAH STAR tracked three wide, bid at the five sixteenths pole, led briefly nearing the lane, but was
repelled and proved no match entering the lane, drifted out while toiling in the winner's wake in upper stretch, dug in for place from bidding foes on either
side in the final sixteenth, and held. WHO TOOK THE MONEY was excused from the post parade as normal, laid off of the pace in the four path, crept
closer turning for home, shifted course outwardly from the five path to the eight path in midstretch to remain outside of the drifting place-holder, then stayed
on to attempt a bid for place in the closing stages, but was kept at bay. BALLINONABUDJET tracked from midpack two wide, shifted inwardly at the quarter
pole while chasing, grinded meagerly to bid for place along the rail at the sixteenth pole, but leveled off. COSMIC TRAIN was slow early and lagged behind
the field around both turns, then surpassed a pair of tiring foes in the closing stages. HIGHLAND CREEK stalked two wide, but failed to bid along with an
outer foe turning for home despite the rider's urging, and yielded between horses through the lane. MAGA MAN tracked along the inside, then faded around
the far turn.

Footnotes
BIG CHOPPER laid far back, commenced a gain two wide and between horses at the three furlong pole, steadily shifted outside of the top flight and to the
six path in upper stretch, and rallied through the final furlong to drive past the leader at the sixteenth pole, and drew clear. RELENTLESS DANCER tracked
four wide, ranged up turning for home, sustained a grinding charge in pursuit of the leaders, but was outkicked by an outer rival nearing the final sixteenth,
kept on, and reached place late. MIKE J bumped an outer rival at the start, sped clear soon after, sparred with an outer bidder leaving the three furlong pole,
shook clear of him at the three sixteenths marker, but hung on his left lead while holding sway through midstretch, but was overhauled by an outer
oncharging rival a sixteenth from home, and lost place late. BRIAN'S IRON MIKE laid off of the pace three wide, got floated to the seven path by the
eventual winner in upper stretch, and moved up late while hanging on her left lead. FIESTY FIST tracked three wide, ranged up to bid for show between
horses entering the lane, but weakened at the furlong grounds. JAX MAN was last away, trailed around the turn, and improved between horses in the
closing stages. WIN YA WIN was bumped and bothered by an inner rival at the start, raced far back two wide, bumped an outer rival while in the seven path
in upper stretch, and lacked a bid. UNIFIED REPORT saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. CREOLE CHARLIE lacked speed four wide, got bumped
to the eight path in upper stretch, and made little impact. YANKEE SEVEN stalked in the two path, chased the top pair around the turn, then weakened
between horses in upper stretch. JANETS JAY JAY tracked along the inside, failed to progress through upper stretch, and faltered between horses late.
BERTIE'S GALAXY stalked three wide, engaged the leader entering the turn, vied two wide around the bend, but failed to keep pace while hanging on his
left lead in upper stretch, and caved in the final furlong.
