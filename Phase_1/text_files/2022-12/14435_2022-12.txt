Footnotes
GONNA CUT IT unhurried early, off rail run far turn to the lead in the stretch run and gamely held under stout handling to the wire. WEEHAWKEN four wide
run first turn, hooked in a stretch duel but denied on the wire in a game effort. TIME TO RACE saved ground to far turn, angled out with a late run for show
spot. CHICA CHULA dueled to the stretch, grudgingly in the late going, game effort. BOLTORO rail run never far back to far turn, angled out with no late
kick. PERFECT ROSE bumped around into first turn, ran on to far turn, gave way. NAUTICAL MILE no speed while never a real factor throughout.
OPTIMIZME dueled from inside to the half with a steady faded thereafter. ARRANMORE between horses while close up to the half, gave way readily.

Footnotes
STREET JAM shuffled early on between horses, angled three wide, rallied on in a game effort. ECHO FOXTROT speed to duel, edged back into the stretch,
came back for place. ROC'S PRINCESS raced back to the stretch, angled inside late, just missed place. IN MY OPINION no speed to the turn off rail,
coming on too late in the stretch. CODE FOR SUCCESS raced evenly to the stretch, finished up well too late. ONLY KIDDING never far back to the turn,
dueled into stretch, weakened late. DO YOU LOVE ME pressed leaders to the turn, gave way in the stretch run. HIDEKI bit tardy, rushed, dueled inside,
weakened in the final furlong. CHARLEE O inside run, never a real threat. LOVE OF MY LIFE inside run to the turn, faded back in the stretch run. WATERS
OF MEROM never a factor.

BULSARA well handled to half, strong far turn run, angled out with a powerful run in the final furlong. WET PAINT chased leader from inside to the stretch,
cleared, overpowered. SATIN DOLL outside run to quarter pole, ran on for show spot late. STELLAR LADY raced behind leaders to far turn, nothing left in
the drive. CHA CHA TAP no speed to far turn, rallied along to only improved position. PROUVER through early, could not keep up and faded back in the
stretch. BAYTOWN LOVELY speed to the front, stayed for three quarters, gave way stretch. CHIQUITA MOSCA never factored. KATIE GOT LUCKY
through after half, dropped back readily. DRE ME LESS was through after the half and dropped far back.
