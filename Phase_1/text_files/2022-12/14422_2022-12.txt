Footnotes
PERFECT DUDE was away in good order to duel for the lead with EL CHAVO DEL OCHO while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole, increased that margin with a furlong to run and held sway to the wire. LINCHPIN STORM lacked early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn, could not reach the winner in the drive but finished with good energy. GATES OF HEAVEN showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the
turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. STAND TO settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
finished evenly. EL CHAVO DEL OCHO broke sharply to dispute the pace with the winner while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. GOLD
CRUSHER was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. CANDY ZIP was
never far back while racing along the inside and gradually weakened.

Footnotes
CHASING FAME was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch and wore down STAY HAPPY to be going away late. STAY
HAPPY was away in good order to press the pace of UNLEASH THE BEAST while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and
gave way to the winner late. MORE HONOR settled off the leaders from the inside, reached a striking position and failed to gain late. HI HO CHEERIO
lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. STALKING SHADOW was void of early speed, raced three-wide through
the turn and did not menace. DILLON ROCKS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. UNLEASH THE
BEAST set a pressured pace from off the rail for a half and weakened. STEAL HOME reared at the start and did not participate thereafter.

leaders early, saved ground through the turn and failed to gain late. BIG SCOTT DADDY raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn,
angled out further into the stretch and lacked the needed rally. WINNING MAGIC raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and finished
evenly. DREAMER'S REALITY lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. CHUCK NAZTY was off slow, raced unhurried early,

weakened through the final furlong. ASSETS INCLUDED showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
CATABILITY dueled for the lead from between foes, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, increased that advantage into the lane and held sway to the
wire. TENACIOUS LION settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. ROUGE SUNSET was reserved
just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. FLYUNDERTHEGRAYDAR pressed the pace while racing
four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. LIVE A GOOD LIFE settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly.
CAPTAIN DASHI raced off the pacesetters early, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch and did not menace. TRACK BOUND lacked
early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. A GEM IS A GEM broke in the air, raced unhurried early, moved seven-wide through the
turn and did not threaten. MARK OF VALOR hopped at the start and was bumped, was then allowed to settle, raced four-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid. PROFOUND ONE showed brief speed and weakened. INDY MOON was bumped at the start, showed no early speed, raced four-wide through
the turn and did not reach contention. MINEHUNTER showed brief speed, raced three-wide through the turn and weakened.
