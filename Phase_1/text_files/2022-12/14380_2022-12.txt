INSPEIGHTOFTRAINER bumped with a rival early, was urged along on the outside, went four wide under strong encouragement around the turn, turned
into upper stretch under a drive, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to get up late. MO THAN LUCK bumped with a rival at the start, was
urged along in the front half of the field, raced in the three path on the turn, gained on the tiring leader while remaining on his inside lead in the stretch, took
the lead into the final sixteenth but was denied while clear for the place. WAVE ACTION bumped with a rival early then was taken in hand, came under
urging while falling well behind, traveled around the turn in the three path, moved inward in upper stretch and finished well to garner the show. EE YAH
broke in and bumped with a foe, accelerated to the lead then sped off to a sizable advantage, remained well clear while inside through the turn, shortened
stride into upper stretch, passed the furlong marker under the crop, led to the sixteenth-pole while exhausted then was overtaken. SIXWILLBERICH was
hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and lacked the needed response. SECOND AND REED was
crowded some early then moved in under urging, raced inside to the two path on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BEAR'S
CORRECT was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and was no factor. TIMES WERE HAND-TIMED

Footnotes
DAME CINCO coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn,
spun two to three wide into upper stretch set down for the drive, drew clear under a drive kept to task. SA FORADADA hustled from the start, chased four
paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path into the turn and was placed to coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun two to three
wide for home, proved no match for the top one while running on to secure the place honors. GAGLIANO tipped out seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch growing detached at the tail of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for
home and offered up a mild bid to improve position to the finish. DANCING SOPHIA six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through
the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was bumped by BRISKY FROLIC a furlong
out, then weakened to the finish. BRISKY FROLIC forwardly placed three wide prompting the leader early on, tucked inside through the turn and was placed
to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in head to head with the aforementioned foe and came outwards bumping that rival
a furlong out, then weakened to the wire. RACING COLORS seven paths off the inside down the backstretch, went four wide through the turn coaxed along
from three furlongs out, angled seven wide at the head of the stretch and tired.

Footnotes
DEE BO was urged along off the pace, slipped past the spill at the nine-sixteenths without issue, moved from the rail to the three path while in dead aim of
the leading duo around the turn, gained to take the lead into upper stretch then shook clear and held under strong urging. BUSTIN THE RULES settled
along the rail, paused inside of the spill at the nine-sixteenths and left that juncture further behind the leaders, went three then four wide around the turn,
floated six wide into the stretch, gained while remaining on his inside lead until the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, lugged in while closing
outside the sixteenth-pole then was given one pop of a right-handed crop, continued to lug in under hand urging while reaching the hindquarters of the
winner into the final sixteenth and missed under right-rein correction but was well clear for the place. POPPY'S PRIDE bumped lightly with a rival at the start
then was corrected off heels, disputed the pace on the outside then in the two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired but held the show.
CASALSA broke out and a bit awkwardly, angled in while going to the front, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied along the rail while still inside that
opponent on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. MIAMI CHROME settled off the early pace, checked sharply behind an injured foe at
the nine-sixteenths, clipped heels while swerving out then fell but returned to his feet and was caught in the stretch by the outrider then walked off. NINTH
HOUR was urged along just off the pace, suffered a significant injury near the nine-sixteenths then had a foe clip his heels and was pulled up then vanned
off.

Footnotes
MOTION TO STRIKE was hustled from the gate, angled in while showing speed, pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three path around the turn,
took the near the three-eighths, shook clear in the two path with a quarter-mile to run, responded well when put to the crop outside the furlong marker and
held under strong urging. MAJESTIC TIGER was urged early then settled on the outside, gained five wide around the turn, dropped to the four path under a
drive near the quarter-pole, pursued the leader while swishing his tail from the whip in the stretch, swapped back to his inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and
safely secured the place. BRUNATE was urged along off the pace, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick
while able to get the show. SPECTATORLESS bumped with a rival at the start, settled under some urging, went two to three wide on the turn, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response. JADE'S DREAM was crowded early then dropped back under urging, went three wide for most
of the turn then shifted four wide, came seven wide into the stretch and improved position without threatening. A HUGE CHECKPOINT was urged along off
the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch, drifted out near the furlong marker and failed to
rally. WAHEEL settled towards the rear, was roused two then three wide on the turn, swung six wide into the stretch and was no factor. STORM SHOOTER
broke a bit awkwardly then bumped with a rival, raced in the front half on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and
had nothing left. READY TO MARCH set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead near the three-eighths and
faded.

Footnotes
SILVER SEEKER stalked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the two to three path around the turn, was given his cue coming to the
five-sixteenths, took the advantage in upper stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that foe into the final sixteenth and
proved best under strong urging. EXCELLENT TIMING moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was challenged while
inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, fought on until near the sixteenth-pole and was outfinished while well
clear for the place. WHO HOO THATS ME bumped with a rival at the start then was bumped by another foe and taken up, settled at the rear, was roused
four wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and was along for the show. BOLD JOURNEY bumped with a rival at the start then came inward,
settled on the outside, chased three to four wide through the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and tired. BREW PUB bumped with a rival at the
start, settled just off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path under urging and came up empty. BAR
FOURTEEN was rated just off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, saved ground on the turn and had nothing left. COLORMEPAZZI was
reluctant to load, bumped with a rival at the start then was forced into another foe and taken up, moved out then was urged along on the outside, dropped to
the rear while five then six wide around the turn, floated seven wide near the quarter-pole and faltered.

Footnotes
BETSY BLUE coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, closed
well outside getting directed out a sixteenth from home as BEGUINE drifted out in front, collared that rival with seventy yards to the finish and edged away
under her own power and momentum to prevail. BEGUINE three wide in aim of the leader, advanced on the top pair to take command when set down
spinning three wide into upper stretch, edged away under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone threat and drifted out a sixteenth from home before
getting collared with seventy yards to the finish and was along clear for the place honors. DISCO EBO stumbled at the start, prompted the pace of SMASH
TICKET to the outside, advanced to take narrow and brief command with five-sixteenths to go, got displaced from the front spinning from the two path into
upper stretch and weakened. SNICKET four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, came under coaxing just off the inside at the
five-sixteenths, angled five wide for home and weakened in the stretch. SMASH TICKET coaxed from the gate, showed the way lightly coaxed along the
inside under pressure from DISCO EBO to the outside, came under urging at the three-eighths, yielded the front with five-sixteenths to run, spun just off the
inside into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
WHAT'S UP BRO came outward at the start then brushed with a foe, showed speed then was taken in hand, stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid
while let out in the two path around the turn, took the lead in the three path into upper stretch and drew away while remaining on his inside lead under strong
urging. QUICK CHAOS was hustled from the gate, moved out under urging then chased the pace, went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the
stretch and safely secured the place while no match for the winner. FOUR EYES was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, came five wide
into the stretch and lacked the needed response while best of the rest. AMERICAN GRANT broke a step slow, was urged along off the pace, saved ground
on the turn and improved position. LITTLE LUCA moved in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the turn, was
asked under threat coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage to the winner into upper stretch and gave way. FERRIS MULER brushed with a foe at the
start, moved in while urged along off the pace, shifted from the rail to the two path around the turn and failed to respond. CONNECT THE BROCKS was
hard ridden on the outside, went four then five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch and was no factor. MICHAEL LEIS was urged along towards
the back, went three wide on the turn and failed to threaten. PERFECT OUTCOME stood in the gate and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths,
moved from four to six wide around the turn and never reached contention. CAMPBELITO was hustled from the start then crowded along the rail near the
eleven-sixteenths, rounded the turn in the two path and showed little.
