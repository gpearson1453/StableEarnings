Footnotes
MI HERMANO RAMON pulled on the inside early, traveled near mid-pack in the middle stages, continued to save ground to the stretch, tipped out and
bumped rival in upper stretch, drew alongside the leader at the eight pole, took over in midstretch then moved clear and held well over the runner-up.
DANDY MAN SHINES (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, chased three then two wide early off the pace, swung five to six wide into the lane, got bumped from
inside in upper stretch, rallied late but had to settle for second best. CARVER sprinted to the front and moved inside, got pressure from outside leaving the
clubhouse turn, maintained a short lead to the second bend, responded when coaxed along and shook free late on the bend, challenged by the winner with
a furlong remaining, relinquished the lead in midstretch and flattened to third. SMART CODE checked off heels two times early, went three deep into the far
turn, spun five wide into the lane, drifted inward in the stretch and kept on for a minor award. BOLT SUPREMACY tracked two wide early, moved closer on
the far turn, came three wide into the stretch, shifted out and bumped rival in upper stretch and lacked a late bid. ASHCROFT stalked two to three wide on
the first turn, moved out on the far turn and came four wide into the stretch, got bumped between rivals in upper stretch and could not rally. JEWELED
SHILLELAGH broke in and bumped rival, pulled early and angled in, saved ground off the pace to the stretch and also failed to rally. DE LA LUNA got
bumped on both sides at the start, raced three wide at the back into the first turn, went between foes on the backstretch, came three wide into the stretch
and never threatened. THE SLAP bumped with inner rival and was put in tight entering the first turn, steered to the inside, moved out to the two path and
never menaced. SHADOW CREEK (IRE) was off slow to begin, got bumped and shuffled on the rail into the first turn, raced at the back on the inside to the
stretch, checked when bothered from outside at the eight pole and was no factor. HEARTBREAK KID chased the leader early then went up to apply
pressure leaving the clubhouse turn, offered a challenge early on the far turn but failed to keep up late on the bend, got bumped from inside at the top of the
stretch and tired down the lane.

Footnotes
MIDNIGHT MAJESTY broke in, dueled for the lead three deep then outside rival into and around the turn, cleared past the quarter pole, crossed over
leaving the bend, kept to task through the lane and held safely. U R PRESSED dueled for the lead between rivals then on the inside leaving the backstretch,
fought through the turn then lost touch with the winner past the quarter pole, switch to the outside and finished willingly to the wire. CROSS EXAMINE was
off slow to begin, moved into stalking position three deep, got bumped from inside and put out to the four path midway around the bend, chased three wide
into the drive and churned on to best the rest. RAISEDAROOFCHARLIE got bumped from inside at the start, stalked between runners up the backstretch,
got put in tight and bumped with outer rival nearing the five-sixteenths pole, came three wide into the lane and lacked a rally. WHISKEY VISION lacked early
speed, raced on the inside then two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. AGRIGENTO broke out and bumped rival, pressed the top pair from inside to
the seven-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders while moving off the rail on the turn and weakened. FROST ALERT threw his head and came away slow,
stalked four deep on the backstretch, started to weaken four wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

two path, angled out into the stretch, closed well through the final furlong but was bested by the winner. LOW EXPECTATIONS bumped leaving the gate,
took control early and angled in on the clubhouse turn, got pressured with three furlongs left to run, maintained command through the far turn and into the

then two wide on the first turn, went up to press the leader at the three-eighths pole, dueled around the far turn, fought through the lane but lacked the
needed late punch in deep stretch. HAWKER stalked the pace from the rail, waited behind the leaders on the far turn, looked to make a run but was halted
at the eighth pole, failed to find room then gained opening in the final sixteenth but was too late. BLUEGRASS RYDER got bumped on both sides while
three deep into the first turn, stalked outside rivals then launched a bid three deep with a quarter mile left to run, could not keep up with the leaders in the
furlong grounds but kept on to the wire. VALIANCER got bumped from inside while traveling four deep into the first turn, tracked off the rail up the
backstretch, moved closer then commence a bid four deep at the quarter pole but faltered in the furlong grounds. RUSSELLS HUSTLE bumped and
steadied between on the first turn, chased three deep then four wide into the stretch and could not rally. GENIUS JIMMY was rank early on the inside then
settled off the pace, had to pause running up behind rivals near the five-sixteenths pole, lacked room in traffic at the top of the stretch, tipped out and failed
to rally. GLENDALE came in and bumped rival leaving the gate, traveled three wide at the back into the first turn, stayed wide and went four wide into the far
turn, came five wide into the stretch and never made an impact. GAELIC NATION (IRE) unhurried on the inside, tipped three wide into the stretch, moved

BLACKENED broke a step slow then went up to duel for command from inside, inched ahead past the quarter pole and held gamely through the lane.
SWEET HELLO dueled for command outside BLACKENED into and around the turn, kept the pressure on through the lane but failed to find the needed late
kick and had to settle for second best. GENERAL WELFARE was off slow to begin, trailed early then advanced outside rivals while taking the turn five then
four wide, closed fast in the furlong grounds but ran out of time. TENACIOUS LADY broke a step slow, got crowded between rivals early, chased the top
pair from off the rail, three then two wide on the turn and lacked a rally. NOBE broke a step slow, chased the top pair along the rail the into the turn, came
two wide into the lane and could not produce a bid. PRESTIGIOUS broke a step slow then was bothered from outside and ropped back, raced near the back
then trailed two wide into the turn, angled to the rail around the bend to save ground and passed tired rivals in the stretch run. FOREST ACCLAMATION
was rank in the early stages, chased off the rail then checked behind TENACIOUS LADY at the three-eighths pole, moved out and raced three to four wide
into the drive and could not rally. CHERRY CHAOS bumped rival at the start, sat off the pace early, traveled on the inside then two wide into the lane and
was not a factor. SHORT JOURNEY raced off the pace, took the turn three wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
RESILIENT broke out, pressed three deep early, dueled three wide exiting the bend, kicked clear in upper stretch and was kept to task to the wire.
HOLIDAY AROUSAL got shuffled between rivals early then chased four deep to the turn, continued four wide into the lane, drifted inward at the eight pole
and put in a mild late bid for the place. I KNOW CASH FLOW set the pace under pressure from a pair of rivals to the outside, maintained command through
the turn, was no match for the winner in upper stretch and flattened to third. SINGLE ME OUT chased three deep early, bumped with inner rival three deep
on the turn, came four wide into the stretch and earned a minor award. BRACE FOR IMPACT pressed from between rivals early, chased the leader two
wide around the turn and faded. SQUARE CAT chased along the rail, two wide into the stretch and never responded when called upon. THIRSTY ALWAYS
chased the pace from between rivals, bumped with SINGLE ME OUT and checked past the five-sixteenths pole, then weakened in the lane.

Footnotes
REGAL GLORY settled in the two path, tipped three wide on the far turn, closed in on the leader in upper stretch, swept by midstretch and powered away
under hand urging. ENGLAND'S ROSE reserved early and steered to the inside, was boxed in near the five-sixteenths pole, steered out into the clear,
rallied and got up for second four deep on the wire. PIZZA BIANCA raced in the two path outside rival towards the rear, traveled between foes on the far
turn, tipped out leaving the bend, summoned a mild rally and missed second between rivals. HAMWOOD FLIER (IRE) sped clear and opened up two then
three wide on the clubhouse turn, padded the lead up the backstretch, remained well clear while angling in on the far turn, held a diminishing lead entering
the final furlong, offered no resistance to the winner in midstretch and got edged for the place and show. AVENUE DE FRANCE (FR) unhurried in the
beginning, traveled two wide around the first turn, three deep on the second bend, chased between in the late stages but was outkicked for the minor
placings. DOLCE ZEL (FR) stalked outside a rival to the stretch and never produced a bid. BIPARTISANSHIP (GB) traveled along the inside near the back,
saved ground to the stretch, then tipped off the rail and failed to rally. EDDIE'S NEW DREAM stalked the pace on the inside throughout and weakened in
the stretch run.

Footnotes
EARLS ROCK (IRE) was closest in pursuit early on, bid outside the leader at the quarter pole, took over inside the eighth pole and gamely prevailed.
LINCOLN HAWK (IRE) traveled three deep into the stretch for the first turn near the back then moved into the two path, gained ground on the far turn and
went between rivals, split rivals in the lane, rallied outside the winner in the closing moments but was too late. MECKLENBURG (IRE) sped clear and angled
in, challenged from outside with a quarter mile remaining, clung to a slim advantage at the eight pole, relinquished the lead shortly after and flattened to
third. ZOFFARELLI (IRE) traveled in mid-pack in the two path, angled four wide on the far turn and finished evenly late. HUDSON RIDGE reserved early
and steered to the inside, tipped two wide into the drive, moved out further in the stretch and improved position. COUNT OF AMAZONIA (IRE) sat off the
pace on the inside, saved ground to the stretch and never responded when needed. FLASHIEST trailed on the inside, moved out on the backstretch, angled
five wide leaving the turn and failed to menace. READY SOUL tracked the pace on the inside out of range, moved closer around the far turn, came off the
rail a bit into the lane and flattened out. CREW DRAGON stalked outside a rival, asked three wide on the far turn and tired.
