Footnotes
SOLID COUNTRY GOLD stalked along the inside, chased the top pair around the far turn, tipped outside of them in midstretch, and sustained a charge to
drive clear in the final sixteenth. HE'S GOT THIS irrelevantly jumped a shadow casted by the grandstand when crossing the wire for the first time, pressed
two wide, vied around the far turn, dueled with his inner counterpart through midstretch, but was outkicked by an outer bidder in the final sixteenth before
prevailing for place. UNCLE NICK set the pace while a bit off of the inner railing, sparred with an outer foe around the far turn, dueled gamely while hanging
on his left lead through the lane, but was outkicked by bidding foe in the late stages, and lost the battle for place. KEEPCALMCARRYON tracked two wide
and between horses early on, but trailed around the far turn, and failed to factor. CREME DE BALI acted up right before the gates opened causing him to
hop and come out multiple lengths slow, then tracked three wide, but weakened turning for home.

J B GRAY took a bump from an outer foe at the start, pressed the leader early on, inherited an advantage entering the turn, set the pace inside of a pressing
rival while remaining in the three path around the bend, dug in to meet an inner rival's bid entering the lane while shifting to the four path, then dueled with
that foe through thereafter, and prevailed. CHIPEEE chased along the inside, smoothly slipped inside of the leaders entering the lane to bid at the quarter
pole, then sparred inside of B GAY through the lane, but did not have enough. HOOSIER laid off of the pace, got carried out to the five path by a troubled
foe entering the turn before tucking to the two path soon after, came into the lane in the three path while aiming between horses, then chased from between
the dueling leading pair through midstretch, lugged inwardly approaching the final sixteenth, then kept on well. STARPORT bumped an inner rival at the
start, stalked outside of the top pair early on, pressed the leader from the four path around the turn, but briefly failed to keep pace while drifting to the six
path entering the lane, and chased the leaders therafter. SPREADING RUMORS lacked speed along the inside, and made little impact. OWEN THE ICE
MAN raced far back two wide, and was outrun. STAR SYZYGY set the pace early on, but was pulled up entering the turn, and got vanned off.

Footnotes
BELEOUT dueled for the lead two wide, led entering the lane, and kicked clear in upper stretch. G'S SQUEEZE tracked along the inside, but drifted to the
five path in upper stretch after being asked to tip outside of the top pair entering the lane, sustained a chase to bid for place along with an inner rival inside
the final sixteenth, and prevailed for that position. RUE LALA laid off of the pace three wide, then stayed on between horses to bid for place in the closing
stages, but just missed to her outer counterpart. ROYAL O'HAIGAIN dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace with that rival
leaving the quarter pole, yielded in upper stretch, and lost place to a pair of rivals in the final sixteenth. SPECIAL CONNECTION lagged behind along the
inside, and stayed on. VISIONOFWILDTIMES chased two wide, then from between horses after the three furlong pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
FIERY PLAYBOY set the pace in the two path, dug in leaving the quarter pole to resist FIESTY FIST's bid in upper stretch, gamely dueled with that foe
thereafter, and tenaciously held through the late stages. FIESTY FIST stalked along the inside, tipped to the three path turning for home to take aim outside
of the leader entering the lane bid in upper stretch, sparred through midstretch without reaching even terms, and was fended off through the final furlong.
BLUE CHEESE laid far back in the two path, shifted to the five path entering the lane, and stayed on to reach show a sixteenth from home. FORTY THREE
tracked from midpack two wide, then chased along the rail hoping to attempt a bid leaving midstretch, but flattened out. HOME VISIT pursued the leader
from between a pair of rivals with taking the turn in the three path, but chased from behind the leaders entering the lane, and slowly gave way. GRUNT
tracked outside of rivals while taking the turn in the four path, and yielded in upper stretch. QUARTER RAT saved ground in midpack, but faded.
TOUCHDOWN JOE lacked speed in the four path, and faded turning for home.

Footnotes
THE ALYS LOOK set the pace, drew clear while well in hand leaving the three furlong pole, felt mild pressure from an outer MO SHIRO turning for home as
that foe attempted a bid, but responded readily when set down in upper stretch, and drew off under intermediate urging. MO SHIRO tracked along the
inside, claimed place while taking aim outside of the clear leader turning for home, but proved no match for that foe entering the lane, and safely managed
place. MO BILLS tracked four wide, and stayed on to reach show. FLOWERDEW laid off of the pace in the three to two path around the first turn, saved
ground while tracking around the far turn, bid for show inside of rivals in upper stretch, vied for that position through the final furlong, but missed to an outer
rival. KATE'S CONCERTO stalked three wide, but was outmoved by an inner rival for place around the far turn, and yielded between horses in the final
furlong. PETERPAM stumbled at the start and trailed the field around both turns, the shifted out approaching midstretch, and lacked a bid. NOMADIC
PRIDE pressed the pace two wide and between horses, then weakened at the three furlong pole. WINDY BAY stumbled and lost her rider at the start, then
was corralled by an out rider post-race, and walked off.

Footnotes
TWO B set the pace, drew clear at the five sixteenths pole, and held sway from an outer chaser while hanging on her left lead. EASY RUNNER stalked
along the inside, shifted to the four path entering the lane to take aim outside of the clear leader, but only managed to chase while proving second best.
HELAIRE laid off of the pace in the three path, improved between horses approaching the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch,
and stayed on. WOODS N WATER laid far back in the three path, swung to the six path entering the lane, and moved up while lugging in entering the final
furlong. OLE STUD MUFFIN laid off of the pace two wide, and failed to factor. MR ELVIN lacked speed in the four path, came into the lane in the six path,
and made little impact. MAGIC LIGHTNING saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW pressed two wide, but faded in the
three to five paths turning for home. BERNIE SPECIAL chased briefly, then steadily faded while drifting from the four path to the eight path turning for home.
