BLUEBERRY EYES saved ground along the rail, then made a rally down the lane to get up for place. BOSSY BABY dueled for the lead down the
backstretch, then began to give way around the turn but held on for show. BRAVE CINDERELLA stalked the pace down the backstretch, going four wide but
offered an even effort in the lane. NOBLE MISS chased the pace early on, going five wide and failed to fire. CARASYNTHIA trailed the field, two wide and

READS PET ZENON set the pace racing in hand, responded when challenged by Rafael's Surprise entering the stretch and maintained a safe advantage.
RAFAEL'S SURPRISE was allowed to settle in stride early, moved up strongly three wide nearing the quarter pole, offered a bold bid entering the stretch
but was unable to stay with the winner late. I GET STORMED saved ground while being reserved off the pace and finished in a mild rally along the inside.
UNBRIDLED OPTIMIST stalked the pace while racing two-wide but lacked a rally when asked. WILD FIREWATER weakened after showing brief speed
while racing three-wide. CANDY RASCAL dropped back early and failed to threaten.

SHELL GAME dueled with Shake Rag from the start from along the inside and prevailed narrowly in a prolonged drive. SHAKE RAG vied for the lead from
along the outside and just missed in a tough decision. BINGOS SYSTEM was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch and rallied late. REBEL
RYETTE saved ground while being reserved off the pace, slipped through to offer a bid entering the stretch and then flattened out during the drive. OLIVE
COUNTY dropped back early, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. FLAMING BESITOS was forwardly placed early racing three-wide and
weakened. SUERTUDA was off a step slow, then moved up three-wide on the turn to be forwardly place and tired during the drive.

Footnotes
TRUST MANDO was allowed to settle inside while saving ground, moved up along the inside on the turn, angled out to be four-wide entering the stretch and
finished strongly to be up in the final sixteenth. STELLARSBLUERIBBON vied with Wiskey Crown while racing two-wide, gained a slight advantage nearing
the three-eighths pole, dueled for the lead from that point and held on gamely during the drive. WISKEY CROWN dueled for the lead from the outside racing
along the inside and held on determinedly when headed to earn the show. SOUTHWESTERN HOPE prompted the issue while racing three-wide but lacked
the needed late response. FLYING FALCON was forwardly placed while racing four-wide on the turn, came five-wide into the stretch and weakened.
FLYING WARRIOR was reserved off the early pace, came six-wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. YANO'S WAY was off a step slow and failed to
threaten. BOOMER WHO broke awkwardly and was not a factor.

Footnotes
DOCTOR TINK stalked the pace racing in hand, rallied five-wide into the stretch and finished fast to be up in the final sixteenth. BONFIRE PARTY bobbled
at the start, then vied for the lead with Silver Ponzi from along the inside, opened a slight lead entering the stretch while drifting out slightly, responded to
pressure and continued on gamely but wasn't quite good enough. DIABOLICAL KING was allowed to settle in stride racing along the inside, rallied two-wide
into the stretch and finished strongly. FEEL THE BERNING was unhurried early, came three-wide into the stretch, angled in during the drive and finished in
a late rally. SILVER PONZI dueled with from along the outside, drifted out entering the stretch and weakened. FINGLAS LAD settled in the middle of the
pack early, came four-wide into the stretch and went evenly. INFINITE CROWN saved ground while being allowed to settle in stride and failed to seriously
threaten. QUANTICO JOE was forwardly placed early, came six-wide into the stretch and tired. BEAN AND THE BUG dropped back early while racing
three-wide and trailed.

three-wide into the stretch and finished in a mild rally. PAINTED SMOKE settled in the middle of the pack, came seven-wide into the stretch but lacked a
rally. JEWELS AND JAZZ dropped back early and passed tiring rivals. OJO FELIZ was allowed to settle in stride, came eight-wide into the stretch and failed
