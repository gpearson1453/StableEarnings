Footnotes
BONITA LASSIE tracked the pace three wide, then angled in leaving the three sixteenths and closed well up the inside to get up in time, driving. PEAK OF
CHIC set the pace while clear on the inside, then shifted off the inside leaving the turn and was clear by the furlong marker, but was caught at the wire to
just miss. TERPEYE was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and had a late rally to best the rest. LOVE IS STRONG was four wide into the first
turn, then settled and saved ground on the turn, eased off the inside mid way on the turn and came five wide into the lane and had no rally while improving
position. FAVORITE DOLL chased the pace on the inside and angled out in the lane and was empty. CAR LADY was off slowly, then was outrun early and
never factored. KATY THE CAT was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and then was three wode on the turn and tired. EARLY FROST
chased the early pace and was between rivals on the turn and stopped. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

faded. MOONSAFE tracked the pace four wide and came five wide into the lane and had no kick. HONORABLE LILLY lacked a solid rally. PROPOSITION

SURPRISINGLY SWEET was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, kicked away leaving the turn and then widened the margin to prove best, driving.
COSMOLOGICAL was well placed early two wide, then was shuffled back on the turn on the inside, then shifted off the inside and finished willingly. ALL
THAT MAGIC chased the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn but flattened out, bested rest. LET'S GO MO was bumped soundly at the start,
came wide into the lane and improved late. MRS BELL stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and then was between rivals leaving the turn
and was empty. LI'LBITO'GLORY chased the pace between rivals and weakened. DUST BUNNY chased the pace on the inside and weakened. GOLDEN
PHASE was wide and not a factor.

Footnotes
HELMS DEEP was away alertly and went on to set the early pace while clear, opened up a big lead down the backstretch, then remained clear leaving the
turn and maintained a safe margin late to prove best, driving. SAMARONTI was reserved early, advanced on the turn and split rivals by the quarter pole,
swung out four wide leaving the turn and rallied well. LONGTAIL was allowed to settle early, then was ridden along on the turn two to three wide, then ran
on late but needed more. VITESSE was void of early speed, then had a late rally on the outside. MINE TO HOLD was allowed to settle on the inside and
lacked a rally. DIGGERS DIAMOND had no rally. FLAT BILL failed to menace. CONTRAFLOW chased the pace four to three wide and tired.
