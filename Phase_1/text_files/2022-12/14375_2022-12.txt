a rally. DEE BUG was reluctant to load, vied for the lead on the inside and weakened. Race was six minutes late going off due to a seven minute load time.

JACK'S LILLY tracked the early pace five wide, then was four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane, closed well on the outside to get up in time.
SPUNKY ZOEY set the early pace on the inside, then dug in gamely in the lane but was caught late. STRAWBERRY POINT rushed up the inside and then
had to check hard at the half mile marker, then made a insie bid leaving the turn but was outfinished. DARN THAT SONG bobbled at the start, prompted the
pace three wide and then faded the final furlong. CAN I GET AN AMEN showed brief speed for a quarter of a mile four wide and then stopped.

ROMANTIC GAMBLE was well placed early two wide, saved ground on the turn, angled out four wide leaving the turn, made a bid andn drew off in the
furlong grounds to prove much the best, ridden out. ON THE RIM set the early pace and was clear on the turn while in the two path, was headed by the
winner and proved to be no match for that rival, clearly second best. MISCHIEVIOUSBUD was rated along early on the inside, eased off the inside on the
turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn, lugged in by the furlong marker and bested rest. FREEDOM'S START hesitated at the start, outrun early, came
five wide into the lane and improved position. JUMP FOR THE WIN chased the pace four wide and weakened. PAID THE PREACHER stalked the early
pace between rivals, then was three wide on the turn and then was empty. GERONIMO was off slowly and then was not a factor. D'STORM stumbled at the
start, rushed up four wide and stopped.

Footnotes
SCARY LARRY tracked the early pace three wide, made a four wide move on the turn, then vied for command nearing the furlong marker on the outside,
then prevailed late after a long drive. VIOLENT PASS stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter
pole, then battled between rivals by the furlong marker and just missed late after a long drive. ACT OF VALOR dueled for the early lead two wide, made a
two wide bid on the turn to shake off that rival, then was challenged by the top two leaving the turn, battled on the inside of that trio by the furlong marker
and was out kicked late. THE LITTLE SPROUT was settled early, advanced two to three wide on the turn, then was blocked by the quarter pole to the
furlong marker, then angled out for racing room and was gaining late, tough trip. TIZ HANDSOME dueled for the lead on the inside and weakened.
TUCKABUCKAWAY lacked a rally. BLO MY BUDGET failed to menace. WINNERS WIN was not a factor.
