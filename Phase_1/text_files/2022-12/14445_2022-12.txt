Footnotes
GIANT CRITIC was fractious in the gate prior to the start, had speed from the start, circled rivals four wide to make the lead entering the far turn then
widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best under mild urging. SEMI CHARMED DAY well placed, had a mild rally into the stretch and finished
clear for second. SCORSESE checked along the rail entering the first turn, chased the pace near the inside, shifted out on the far turn then faded late.
LEXATOGA failed to menace. KING OF THE RING was through after a half. RED PIXIE was no factor. VALEROSO set the pace to the seven sixteenths
pole, had speed into the stretch then stopped.

PRESCIENCE trailed into the stretch, swung wide, circled her field rapidly in the middle of the racetrack, made the lead late and drew clear under brisk
handling. PRINCESS MORO never far back, offered a mild bid four then three wide on the far turn and finished second best. ORBIT BOUND sped the lead
on the clubhouse turn, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished. MOANA'S TALE away alertly, pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn
then gradually weakened. MON PARADIS well placed, failed to respond. PASATIME raced in the six path into the first turn, stalked the pace three wide and
was through after a half.

Footnotes
HELLO SWEETS pressed the pace two wide into the turn, made the lead, set the balance of the pace and won under a hand ride. CHANEL SPIRIT stalked
the pace near the inside, had a mild late rally and finished well clear for second. SEEYOUINMOTOWN with the second flight inside, dropped back on the
turn then came on again late in the four path. EMERSON JONES away alertly, set the pace along the inside into the turn, had speed into the stretch then
weakened. HERE COMES DOLLY unhurried early, moved up widest on the turn then leveled off. SAVESOMEFORME failed to menace. NO MORE
MARGS had good early speed then faded. MISS BUMBUM with the second flight three wide, was through after a half. BONNIE'S BEST was outrun.
