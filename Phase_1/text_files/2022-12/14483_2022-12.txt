WESTERN LANE hustled from the gate, chased three paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked inside half a mile from home and came under light
coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch under a drive, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking
command just inside the sixteenth marker, then dug in gamely to prevail over a pair. SOURCING NETWORK coaxed from the gate, chased five paths off
the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug
in under a drive and was herded out a few paths through the final sixteenth while up for the place honors in the last jumps. WINGS LIKE EAGLES showed
the way in hand four paths off the inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole drifting out, got corrected through the stretch but continued to drift out through to the finish about eight
paths in total herding SOURCING NETWORK out through the final sixteenth and was caught by a pair and forced to settle for the show honors. DOLCE
SERA chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths and trailed.

Footnotes
FOREVER WICKED broke in and hit the gate then brushed with a foe, was urged along well off the pace, went three wide for most of the turn, shifted five
wide late on that bend, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed strongly to get the lead outside the furlong marker then drew away under steady urging.
JADE'S DREAM was pinched back between foes shortly after the start, settled on the inside, was roused along the rail on the turn, turned into upper stretch
under a drive and earned the place while no threat to the winner. DONTBELATE disputed the pace on the inside of rivals, vied in the two path while under
some extra left-rein pressure around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch, fought under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show.
EL MAYOR brushed with a rival at the start, pressed the pace on the outside of three foes, vied in the five path around the turn, fought under a drive into the
final furlong and tired. HAGLER was hustled from the gate, moved out nearing the seven-eighths, gained to dispute the pace between foes, vied in the four
path around the turn, dropped back while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch and tired. SUPER WICKED CHARM showed no speed under urging,
went four to five wide on the turn and was no factor. LAST MINUTE MARIO contested the pace between rivals, brushed with a foe outside the half-mile
pole, vied in the three path while still between foes on the turn, dropped back outside the five-sixteenths and retreated.

the five-sixteenths before pausing behind rivals, swung three wide for home, angled in awkwardly at the three-sixteenths to the rail, dug in under tepid
handling receiving one sole swat with the crop to the right side near the sixteenth marker along the rail and was heads apart for command through the final
furlong and just missed at the end. RUN DEVIL vied four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch, got headed near the eighth pole and dug in under a drive between foes through to the finish taking back brief and narrow command at the sixteenth
marker while fighting on to the end but was ultimately bested by a pair. FREUDIAN six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through

Footnotes
ITS ALL RELEVANT went to the front, moved in leaving the chute, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside to the two path around the turn, came
under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop inside the furlong marker, drifted out some nearing the sixteenth-pole and held
under strong urging. IT'S MANDATORY was well placed just off the pace, moved up with five furlongs to run to make a bid, vied outside in the three path
around the turn, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. VINTAGE HOLLYWOOD was bumped in the hindquarters
at the start, settled on the outside, was urged three wide around the turn and lacked the needed response while able to get the show. O SHEA CAN U SEE
moved out early, dropped well behind the rest of the field, went three to four wide on the turn and was no factor. JACK THE CAT settled off the pace, saved
ground under urging on the turn and failed to respond. PRINCE OF JOY broke in and brushed the gate then bumped the hindquarters of an opponent,
tracked the pace on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, came up empty in the four path around the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
GULFSTREAM WAY went to the front, set the pace under pressure from multiple foes from the outside, passed the half-mile pole under urging, vied along
the rail around the turn, spun into the stretch in the two path, responded well in the drive and held gamely under strong urging. LUNI SIMA stalked the pace
on the outside, was asked in the four then three path around the turn, issued a challenge outside of the winner, fought with that foe in the stretch and
missed while clear for the place. MONEY SUPPLY was in tight between foes early, settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide around the turn,
turned into upper stretch under a drive, held a good striking position into the final furlong but flattened out while just able to get the show. ROYAL TRYST
was hustled from the gate, steadied while in tight between foes early, was urged along on the outside, went five wide on the turn and improved to just miss
the show. THREE JOKERS broke in at the start, was urged along off the pace, went two then three wide early on the turn, angled to the five path later on
that bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SOUTHERN FLAG pressed the pace between horses, dropped back in the three path on the
turn and tired. MANDATORY came outward in the early going, pressed the pace between horses, was urged along passing the half-mile pole, dropped back
in the two path around the turn and capitulated. BLAKE B. was taken in hand between foes early then well placed just off the pace, came under urging late
on the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faltered.

TONAL IMPACT bumped at the start by TIMBUKTU, who broke outwards, raced three wide through the first turn settled near the rear of the field, began a
steady advance four paths off the inside down the backstretch and through the far turn moving into prominence three furlongs from home, got placed to
coaxing near the five-sixteenths and continued to advance taking command just outside the quarter pole before swinging five wide at the head of the stretch,
then drew clear under a drive getting geared down in the late stages and hopping tracks left by the gate before crossing the wire. GUT FEELING coaxed
from the gate, tracked the front just off the inside in close aim, advanced under coaxing from the three-eighths and took over brief command with
five-sixteenths to go before being displaced by the eventual winner near the quarter pole, swung three wide at that station and ran on to chase the winner
home well clear of the rest and along second best. TIMBUKTU broke out at the start bumping TONAL IMPACT into AIR SHOW, raced three wide through
the first turn, settled four then three wide in pursuit from mid pack coming under coaxing three furlongs out, angled five wide into upper stretch, proved no
match for the top pair while along clear and best of the rest. BLU GROTTO chased two to three wide under coaxing from the half mile pole, angled seven
wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals to the finish. BERT BERT BERT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing when tucked inside half a
mile from home, saved ground through the far turn, went three wide into upper stretch and tired. NANTASKET BEACH coaxed from the gate, raced three
wide through the first turn before chasing four then three wide coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung six wide into upper stretch and tired.
BIG VENEZUELA coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from AIR SHOW and then GUT FEELING, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths and yielded the front near the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch in retreat and faltered. AIR SHOW
coaxed from the start, raced four then three wide forwardly placed through the first turn, prompted the leader from the outside three then two wide for the
opening half mile, began to fade and was coaxed along through the far turn, went five wide into upper stretch and was eased home to the finish. MO
REWARDS chased along the inside under coaxing from the half mile pole, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and was eased to the finish getting
pulled up just before crossing the wire, then walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
LADY QUINN bumped with a rival at the start, sped to the front then opened up a sizable lead, extended the advantage in the two path around the turn,
responded well under steady urging into the final furlong and proved much the best while kept to the task. DERWIN'S PAYNTER was urged along off the
pace, went four to five wide on the turn and safely secured the place while no threat to the winner. UKRAINIAN PRINCESS broke in then hit the gate and
was last away, went five wide on the turn and improved for the show. JESSICA'S RACE was urged along off the pace, steadied while disliking the kickback
near the half-mile pole, went three wide while behind horses early on the turn, shifted five wide while roused at the three-eighths and also improved position.
SUPER SLIDE was coaxed along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and failed to threaten. FRANKIE KNOWS BEST broke awkwardly then bumped
with a foe, raced well back in the field, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the quarter-pole and was no factor. STRIKING MELODY
was urged along on the outside, went three to four wide on the turn and faltered. SLY SLOANE bumped with a foe at the start then bumped lightly with
another foe, followed the leader down the backstretch, dropped from the three path to the rail around the turn and also faltered. FOUR QUARTZ bumped
with a foe after the start, was coaxed along off the pace, came up empty in the two path on the turn and retreated.
