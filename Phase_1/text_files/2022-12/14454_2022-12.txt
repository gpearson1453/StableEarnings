Footnotes
SPEEDY HANS rated from the two path into the far turn, shifted out to the six path under rousing turning into the stretch, and rallied past many inside rivals
in the final furlong to win. IT'S A GAMBLE stalked from the two path, tipped out to bid three wide turning into the lane, and ran on but was outrun by the
eventual winner to finish with place honors. KARTANO tracked in the four path, bid from said position turning into the stretch, and kept on to secure show.
QUIET OUT EAST raced from wellback in the four path, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, and finished evenly. OVER THE CHANNEL
prompted the pace from the three path, bid entering the lane, briefly led in upper stretch, but yielded inside the final furlong. DANIEL SUN set the pace from
inside but gaveway going into the final furlong. SONIC SPEED chased from the three path but was tired entering the stretch. SAND DANCER trailed
throughout from the three to five paths. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
BEDTIME STORY set a clear pace in the two path, drifted out under right-handed urging in the lane and held clear. MAMA STRONG was bumped at the
start, stalked the winner in the three path and was unable to gain on that foe while holding well clear of the rest. LOVE IS AWESOME lacked early speed,
raced four wide and was along for the show. CONCEPTUS broke in and bumped MAMA STRONG into LITTLELADYISAWOMAN at the start, chased the
pace three wide and came up empty in the lane. LITTLELADYISAWOMAN was bumped at the start, saved ground and never threatened. CHILD
MEMORIES was outrun while racing two wide.

Footnotes
EMPEROR'S APPEAL hopped at the start, tracked the pace from the three path, was roused from the two path turning into the stretch, bid going into the
final furlong, and drew past near the sixteenth pole. BIG DATA set the pace in the three path, tucked in to the two path around the turn, was cued from the
four path entering the lane, dug in, but was caught by an inner foe around the sixteenth pole to finish with place honors. IMMENSE FAITH broke out at the
start, prompted the pace from the four path into the turn, was ridden from the five path going into the stretch, and evened out but held show. SILVER N
BLACK trailed from the two path early, moved up between rivals around the turn, but was one paced through the stretch. RUN CORY RUN stalked along
the inside, had to steady going into the turn, and was no factor. EVENTFUL had an awkward start and chased from the five path into the turn, but was no
menace.

Footnotes
KANTHARI was in tight at the start, trailed early, advanced three wide around the turn, brushed with CAJUN PUZZLER in upper stretch, closed outside,
seized command near the sixteenth pole and edged ahead while ridden out. ALLEN DIGGS set the pace in the two path, yielded to the winner near the
sixteenth pole and held the place. HAPPY RUNNER steadied early, raced off the pace inside, lugged in in midstretch, was finally angled out late and rallied
for the show. FREDO had early speed inside, steadied near the three-eighths marker, chased inside around the turn, bid at the rail in midstretch and was
outfinished. PAPA JOJO failed to menace while racing three and four wide. COMMAND TO FIRE played no factor while racing two wide. CAJUN PUZZLER
prompted the pace three wide, brushed with the winner in upper stretch and retreated. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

Footnotes
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND raced between rivals around the first turn, chased from the three path down the backstretch, moved up around the far turn and bid
from the six path going into the stretch, and drew clear. KRYPTON tracked in the two path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, shifted further out
going into the final furlong, and ran on for place. BLACK SEAL was three wide around the first turn, trailed from the five path down the backstretch, cut the
corner going into the lane, and passed tiring foes late to get up for show. CAPTURE MI was held up along the inside around the first turn, moved up to force
the pace from the three path into the backstretch, was roused to the lead around the far turn, drifted out to the five path going into the stretch, and faded.
NATURE BOY set the pace from the two path, was prompted from said position down the backstretch, and yielded turning into the stretch. BLUTO'S
CANDY was slow into stride and raced from off the pace along the inside, swung out to the six path going into the stretch, and was no threat. DANLEY had
a slow start, rated in the three path early but was empty in the five entering the lane.

Footnotes
TIZ A PRINCE set the pace along the rail, kicked in upper stretch and held sway under a drive. WAR STRATEGY settled off the early pace while racing two
wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner through the lane but was unable to reel him in. BARRAGE saved ground in
midpack early, went two wide between foes around the far turn, angled out turning for home and was one-paced through the lane. VALIANT AVENGER
broke awkwardly, saved ground off the pace, went two wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals in the lane. QUITE READY tracked the pace three
wide around the first turn, angled in early on the backstretch, chased inside from there and lacked a closing bid. EYES OF CHAMPION played no factor
while racing three wide. ASSIDUOUSLY (GB) was outrun inside. LOYAL LOUIE prompted the pace two wide, bid nearing the quarter pole and tired in the
lane. MUNDO MIX settled off the early pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn then retreated through the lane while not being
urged. THIS RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

TOO MUCH ACTION rated from the rail, had to steady passing the half, moved up from said position around the turn, was cued while shifting out to bid
three wide into the stretch, and drew off in the final sixteenth. ONE AMERICA bumped with an outer foe at the start, prompted the pace from inside, bid from
said position into the stretch, and kept on for place. DOUBLE PLAY KING set the pace from the four path into the turn, tucked in to the two path around the
turn and was cued when headed going into the lane, dug in in upper stretch but yielded between rivals going into the final furlong to show. BIRD WILDCAT
bumped with an inner rival at the start, was hustled along while behind and in the five path going into the turn, and flattened in the stretch. PRINCE OF
IRON raced from off the pace in the six path but was no factor. CARRONADE stalked in the three path but backed up around the turn.
SAINTHOODFORBRIAN raced prominently from the five path, but was empty turning into the stretch.

KITTY QUICK was bumped at the start, set the early pace in the two path, settled back when DULCE AMBICION ran off down the backstretch, advanced
inside around the far turn, took over turning for home, kicked clear soon after and just lasted. RIDING PRETTY had early speed inside, took back off the
runaway leader down the backstretch, continued to save ground around the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, closed two wide and just missed. MISS
NEW YORK stalked the early pace three wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, drifted out turning for home and was one-paced through the lane.
TALL GIRL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide, was floated seven wide turning for home and lacked the needed rally.
CLASSIC VINYL saved ground well back, bumped with DULCE AMBICION in upper stretch then had a mild belated gain. ONE OF ONE was bumped at the
start, raced two wide and never threatened. IRONY was bumped at the start and made little impact while racing two and three wide. DULCE AMBICION
raced in the five path around the first turn, ran off down the backstretch, continued to lead in the three path around the far turn, was collared turning for
home, bumped soon after and retreated. RACE WAS HAND-TIMED.

SHEZA HAPPY GIRL stalked the pacemaker in the three path, was roused between rivals around the turn, bid from the four path at the top of the lane, took
the lead passing the eighth pole, and held on. YOUR INHERITANCE prompted the pace from the five path into the turn, was driven from the six path into
the stretch, ran on and bid going into the final furlong, but hung late to place. HEIRESSINDY reared leaving the gate and raced from off the pace in the two
path, was coaxed from the three path going into the stretch, and passed the tired pacesetter late to get up for show. AMAZING TRIP got sent to the lead
from inside, was ridden around the turn, cut the corner into the lane, but yielded passing the eighth pole. HANNITA'S EMPIRE tracked in the four path,
swung out to the seven path going into the lane, and flattened. ARETE'S CHALICE trailed from the four path into the turn and never threatened. QUEEN
