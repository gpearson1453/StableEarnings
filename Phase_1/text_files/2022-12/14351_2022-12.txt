LAURI'S WISH went to the front to set all the pace and proved best. HOLIDAY DIAMOND was placed close up in the three path made a bid on the turn,
went four to five wide in to the stretch and got up for the place. BOURBON ST TAPPIN was unhurried until the final turn then made a two wide bid, drifted in
at the top of the stretch and was out kicked late. ANDIAMO GIACOMO was four wide into the first turn settled in mid pack down the backstretch went four to
five wide in upper stretch for a late run to improve his position. CHEATIN CHARLIE vied for the lead from the two path to the eighth pole and tired.
ALIGNED INTEREST tracked the leaders from the three path and was not a threat. SALUTE NOW race in the middle of the pack while making a rail trip,
was in tight at the top of the stretch and steadied.

Footnotes
MAD GOLD was within striking distance from the four path, started to make a move on the turn then was three to four wide in upper stretch and took the
lead in the final yards and drove clear late. JACKIE MOON was placed close up in the two path, gained the lead at the sixteenths pole and was caught in
the final yards. HALF A BUCK tracked the leaders from the three path, made a late run in the stretch to just miss the place. BIG SESSY saved ground down
the backstretch and made a late rally to miss the show. SOUTH AL SPARKY was placed off the pace from the inside and gave way. CANDY SHOPPER
was last away and passed tiring rivals. BIG RUSSSS sprinted to the lead and was caught in early stretch and tired. AMAZING AMERICAN raced in the
middle of the pack from the two path but was not a threat. PAYNTED LOVER was always back.

LUCKY BREAK was hustled to the front to vie for the lead then settled off the pace on the turn made a three wide bid into the stretch and was kept to task.
ESCROW STYLE raced in the middle of the pack from the three path then went four to five wide in upper stretch to have his best strides late. SPEEDY G
went to a early lead was headed and came again to take a clear lead but was out kicked in the drive. TENOR raced near the back and made a two wide
rally to improve position. CLERIC was forwardly placed then made a mild bid before the turn and finished evenly. FLASHY PREMO had no early speed,
made a late effort but was never a threat. SPECIAL BREED was rushed to contention to take a brief lead but was used up. WAITIN' ON A WOMAN was
placed off the pace then retreated .
