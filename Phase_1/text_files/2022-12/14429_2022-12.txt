Footnotes
GET HAMMERED sent clear set the pace widening on the far turn digging in from the three path down the lane holding late to inside pressure. JOYRIDE
unhurried early advanced on the far turn saving ground to upper stretch bidding gamely late along the rail. RY'S REVENGE slow early lagged to the far turn
finding belated stride in upper stretch finishing well. TREVILION stalked the pace chasing through the far turn wearing out in upper stretch. SAINT SCOTTY
played no factor. BIG FALCON ROCKET chased early then gave way. GOLDEN OAK was never involved. PEAR LEMONADE was always outrun.
