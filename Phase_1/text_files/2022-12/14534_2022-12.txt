Footnotes
BASALT STREET tracked the top pair from the two path, loomed a danger outside of them entering the lane, challenged the leader at the furlong grounds
while sparking a duel, and edged away through the final sixteenth. MAESTRIA set the pace along the inside, dug in to resist BASALT STREET's bid in
midstretch, but was bested. GRACELEADSUSHOME bumped an outer foe before propping soon after, trailed, shifted four wide and between horses in
upper stretch, and stayed on to reach show at the wrie. LOVELYREDSTILETTOS was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start, stalked outside of the
pace setter, then only managed to chase the top two through midstretch, but yielding, and lost show at the wire. CRYPTO BRAVE tracked in midpack two
wide, and lacked a bid. FUNKYLITTLESHACK bumped an inner rival at the start, raced far back two wide, improved between horses entering the lane
before greenly changing leads in upper stretch, but lacked a rally thereafter. ROCKETT MAGIC saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail.
SHESABEAUTYDANCER also took bumps between rivals at the start, lacked speed three to five wide, and tired. CANDY'S PRIDE bobbled slightly at the
start, then lacked sped four wide, and faded.

EL DEAL ME ACES stalked outside of the pace setter, vied around the turn, led in upper stretch, inched clear at the furlong grounds as ALLNIGHT
MOONLIGH pursued, and held sway from that rival late. ALLNIGHT MOONLIGHT stalked the top pair from the outside around the turn, then chased the
clear leader well through the final furlong to prove second best. AZTEC GEM set the pace inside of a vying rival around the turn, got headed in upper
stretch, and gave way in the final furlong. F T W SLAM tracked in the three path, then failed to progress before tiring late, yet lasted for fourth. CUSTOM
CADILLAC was taken in hand in the early stages, raced off of the pace in the two to three paths, stayed on between horses in midstretch, but failed to reach
fourth. IRON MOON took a bump from an inner rival causing him to come out a step slowly at the start, raced far back along the, chased behind foes in the
four path in upper stretch, sh9fted in in the final furlong, but lacked a bid. WISHERT hopped while spotting the leaders many lengths at the start, raced far
back two wide, swung five wide entering the lane, but made little impact. SPECIAL AGENT JIM laid off of the pace along the inside, improved two wide and
between horses turning for home, but weakened in midstretch. LE MONSTRE RAPIDE bumped an outer rival before shying at the start, was urged along
despite lacking speed in the four path, then faltered between horses in midstretch. DREWNANIMOUS broke slowly and showed little. PARKER NOW
tracked along the inside, but weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
MOON SWAG laid off of the pace, inched closer three wide around the far turn, took aim on a newly leading CHARLIES PENNY in upper stretch, drove past
her at the furlong grounds, and kicked clear. POWDER RIVER tracked along the inside, patiently bided time turning for home as a pair of outer rivals made
first moves, surpassed an inner rival before taking aim inside of the leading pair in midstretch, and chased mildly to gain place at the wire. CHARLIE'S
PENNY stalked two wide, bid for the lead in the three path entering the lane as an outer rival loomed a danger, led briefly in upper stretch, but was
outkicked at the furlong grounds, sparred with an inner rival for place thereafter, but was bested late. BOW BOW GIRL trailed, then surpassed a weakening
rival in midstretch without threatening. LIL KINGS PRINCESS set a clear pace, but offered little resistance to a pair of outer bids entering the lane, and
caved in hand.

Footnotes
CORONA BOLT set the pace along the inside while well in hand around the turn, shook free while under restraint entering the lane, was roused at the three
sixteenths pole, responded willingly to a right handed crack inside the final furlong, drew further clear, and was geared down through the final sixteenth.
DISTORTED PRO stalked along the inside, waited in hand turning for home, but failed to accelerate when driven inside of rivals in upper stretch, fought on
gamely for place through the final furlong, and prevailed`. TODDCHERO was last away while brushing with an inner rival, tracked from the two path, tipped
three wide entering the lane, grinded away on his left lead to gain place in midstretch, battled with an inner game rival for that position through the final
furlong, but gave in late. LATE SEPTEMBER stalked three wide, pressed under strong urging two wide around the turn, but chased from between horses in
upper stretch before yielding at the furlong grounds. ALTO ROAD failed to factor. MACHINE GUN MAN pressed the pace two wide and between horses
early on, but chased nearing the turn, and gave way at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
SILVER HEIST had his head turned to the right when the gates opened causing him to break a step slow, tracked four wide, ranged up three wide turning
for home, inherited an advantage from a tiring rival in upper stretch, drove clear at the furlong grounds, and held from a host of closing-in rivals late.
WOODYTHEBIDSPOTTER steadied along behind rivals through the opening stages while off of the pace in the two path, inched closer between horses
turning for home, shifted out seven wide approaching midstretch, and rallied to reach place via a dead-heat at the wire. SENSE YOU ASKED brushed the
outer part of the gate before bobbling at the start, trailed three wide, rallied four wide around the turn, sustained stride to take aim on the clear leader in the
final furlong, but leveled off, and was caught at the wire to dead heat for place. GAMETIME GLADIATOR chased from midpack three wide and between
horses into the turn, yielded turning for home, yet regained stride while shifting six wide in midstretch, and stayed on among foes. ODDSONTONY raced far
back two wide, fanned eight wide in midstretch, and stayed on mildly outside of rivals while chasing foes home. RATE CONFIRMATION tracked two wide
and between horse, gained along the rail turning for home, but was blocked and steadied behind the tiring early-pace setter in upper stretch, then chased on
through the final furlong. GEM COLLECTION chased the clear leader from the two path, but lost place while yielding between horses entering the lane. HEY
JACKSON was hustled to a clear lead early on, opened up around the turn, but was overhauled at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. COTE
D'IVOIRE broke a step slow before shying from an inner rival at the start, and was outrun. JOINT VENTURE chased along the inside, but weakened around
the turn.

Footnotes
OLIVIAOFTHEDESERT tracked two wide early on, then along the inside around the far turn, tipped out four wide in upper stretch to take aim on the newly
clear leader, sustained a grinding charge to bid at the sixteenth marker, and forged an advantage late. WAVE OF GOODNESS stalked along the inside,
then outside of the top pair around the far turn, made a menacing bid turning for home, drew clear leaving the quarter pole, held sway through midstretch
while hanging on her left lead, but met OLIVAOFTHEDESERT's bid at the sixteenth pole, and got caught in the shadow of the wire. LAKE LUCERNE settled
off of the pace two wide, shifted four wide and between horses in upper stretch, then stayed on well in hopes of reeling in the top pair late, but ran out of
ground. ISLAND HIDEAWAY (GB) trailed along the inside, swung five wide entering the lane, offered a mild kick while hanging on her left lead, chased the
top pair in the final furlong, but was outkicked by an inner rival for show a sixteenth from home. CARPE VINUM pressed two wide, but was outkicked by an
outer foe nearing the lane, and gave way. MO CLARE'S set the pace inside of a pressing rival, but failed to resist a wider foe's bid turning for home, and
weakened in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BANISHING set the pace inside of a pair of vying foes, showed the way in hand around the far turn, and drew off leaving the quarter pole under strong hand
urging before finishing willingly through the final sixteenth. MOBSTER tracked two wide, ranged up three wide around the far turn, but quickly failed to keep
pace with the pace-setter in upper stretch while gaining place, changed leads as a pair of rivals threatened for place in midstretch, and safely held that
position. PYRENEES laid off of the pace three wide, inched closer between horses around the far turn, then stayed on willingly, but was fended off for place.
DON'T LET GO settled off of the pace along the inside, gained between horses while shifting out turning for home, came into the lane five wide, grinded
away to bid for minor placings, but leveled off. SINGLE RULER settled far back four wide, rallied outside of foes around the far turn, but flattened out
between horses leaving the quarter pole, and yielded. DREAM FORCE bumped an outer rival at the start before being put to a bit of crowded quarters soon
after, trailed along the inside, then in the three path around the far turn before fanning to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. MORE THAN FIVE
stalked along the inside, and from the pocket around the far turn, but faded. LIBERTY'S HAULER broke a step slow, raced far back in the two path, then
three to four wide around the far turn before yielding while floating six wide entering the lane. Z Z'S PRINCE bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off
of the pace two wide and between horses, awaited racing room turning for home, but failed to factor. AMANWALKSINTOABAR prompted the pace three to
two wide, but caved between horses entering the lane. NOTION vied two wide and between horses, but weakened entering the far turn. BAYOU CHROME
tracked along the inside, but also faded into the final bend.

Footnotes
DAZZLING BLUE rushed to the fore after a flat-footed beginning, set the pace along the inside while in hand, met a challenge from GAVINERA turning for
home, shook free of that one entering the lane before MISS SHIPMAN offered a menacing bid in upper stretch, yet swiftly repelled that one as well at the
furlong grounds, and drew off. CONDENSATION was reluctant to load, raced prominently along the inside early on, but faltered and lost multiple positions at
the half mile pole, was roused while shifting off of the inside into the turn, paused while awaiting racing room turning for home, shifted five wide and between
horses in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for lace at the sixteenth pole, and narrowly prevailed. MISS SHIPMAN tracked three to four wide, loomed a danger
entering the lane, bid in upper stretch, but was turned away at the furlong grounds, vied for place with a pair of outer rivals in the closing stages, and was
bested late. TWICE AS SWEET broke a bit out at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, swung six wide entering the lane, grinded away to bid for
place along with an inner rival at the sixteenth pole, but missed. PROMISE OF HOPE trailed, swung seven wide in upper stretch, and stayed on.
NEUTRALIZE tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket around the turn, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading. FLAMAND
pressed two wide and between horses, but yielded in upper stretch. GAVINERA stalked three wide, bid turning for home, but was repelled entering the lane,
and weakened between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SURVEILLANCE tracked in the three path, tipped four wide while creeping closer turning for home, sustained a bid in upper stretch, forged an advantage at
the furlong grounds, and edged clear. BANGO prompted the pace along the inside, backed off to stalk leaving the half mile pole, tipped outside of the pace
setter entering the lane to produce a re-bid along with an outer SURVEILLANCE in upper stretch, but was outkicked by that foe at the furlong pole. HEART
RHYTHM laid off of the pace while urged along in the two path around the turn, shifted five wide entering the lane, failed to progress through midstretch, but
improved position late. HIGH CRUISE set the pace two wide before clearing to the rail nearing the turn, but was headed by a pair of bidders nearing the
furlong grounds, and gave way. MILES AHEAD chased while forward two wide and between horses, but faded turning for home. MANNY WAH trailed in the
three path, but failed to make an impact. TULANE TRYST stalked three wide, but was outkicked by rivals on either side in upper stretch, and weakened.

SPOOKY CHANNEL stalked three wide before vying two wide entering the backstretch, sparred with his inner counterpart around the far turn, dueled
through upper stretch, drew clear at the furlong grounds, and held sway. ENGLISH TAVERN tracked four to two wide, then chased the leader home well
through the lane. BIG AGENDA laid off of the pace two to three wide, and stayed on. GENTLE SOUL set the pace two wide, vied inside of SPOOKY
CHANNEL down the backstretch, dueled around the far turn and into upper stretch, but gave way at the furlong grounds. TEMPER TANTRUM tracked
along the inside, then in the two path around the far turn, but lacked a bid. RISK MANAGER saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. BIZZEE
CHANNEL stalked along the inside, but faded. CAPTIVATING MOON never got involved.

Footnotes
JACE'S ROAD set the pace while well in hand, showed the way from a pair of fully-extended chasers turning for home, inched clear of them when set down
at the three sixteenths pole, drew off under a stout hand ride coming to midstretch, and was put to wraps with seventy yards to go. RAISE CAIN laid off of
the pace while tucking from the four path to two path around the first turn, tracked while nibbled along by the rider down the backstretch, advanced between
horses turning for home before taking aim outside of the leading pair entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader while chasing coming
to midstretch, sustained stride to bid for place in the final sixteenth, and forged that position late. DETERMINEDLY bobbled at the start, recovered to press
the pace two wide into the first turn, came under coaxing nearing the far turn, sustained pressure around the far bend, but failed to keep pace with the
leader in upper stretch, yielded while tiring in the closing stages, and was caught at the wire for place. HAYES STRIKE tracked along the inside, but only
managed to chase through the lane. ANDTHEWINNERIS laid off of the pace in the two path, shifted four wide in upper stretch, but lacked a rally while
wandering about slightly to remain outside of rivals in midstretch, and gave way late. OLD ALLIANCE stalked three wide, but weakened once floated four
wide nearing the lane. MAZING MARK reared while fractious in the starting gate, then broke a step slow at the start, and got outrun.

Footnotes
PRETTY MISCHIEVOUS stalked along the inside, moved forward between the leading pair to vie leaving the nine sixteenths pole, sparred with an outer
rival around the far turn, shook clear of her in upper stretch, and held sway from a chasing foe through the final furlong. THE ALYS LOOK settled off of the
pace two wide, gained four wide around the far turn, and stayed on to prove second best. VAHVA stumbled and took a bump froman inner rival at the start,
trailed along the inside, gained three wide around the far turn, but lugged inwardly leaving the quarter pole, altered course back outside soon after, grinded
away to bid for show at the sixteenth pole, and forged that position late. HAYUNEVANO stalked three wide, pressed before vying into the far turn, but gave
way in upper stretch. HANG THE MOON bumped an outer rival at the start, then saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. JUST LIKE MAGIC raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain that position at the five furlong pole, then weakened among foes at the three furlong marker.
COTTON CANDY ANNIE tracked four wide, chased two wide around the far turn, but weakened between horses entering the lane. TWO MINUTE DRILL
tracked in the two path while keen around the first turn, but tired while being shuffled back behind the early pace setter turning for home. ALL ABOUT ME
set the pace while rank and keyed up around the first turn, met a pair of bids down the backstretch, and weakened at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
HAPPY AMERICAN laid off of the pace in the three path, tracked three to four wide around the far turn, bid in upper stretch, led while shifting out at the
furlong grounds, and kicked clear. MR. WIRELESS tracked three wide, ranged up four wide to bid at the five sixteenths pole, sparred with an inner rival in
upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds. FORZA DI ORO stalked two to three wide, bid
among foes turning for home, vied while tucking entering the lane, but was bested by a pair of outer foes in midstretch. SPA CITY tracked along the inside,
shifted between horses turning for home, but was shuffled behind traffic entering the lane, and chased thereafter. CHESS CHIEF raced in midpack two wide
under constant pressure, floated six wide entering the lane, and stayed on. BUSINESS MODEL raced far back inside, shifted four wide and between horses
in upper stretch, then failed to menace while continuing to shift out. INTREPID HEART broke awkwardly, trailed before swinging eight wide entering the
lane, and moved up. RIGHTANDJUST pressed two wide, bid for the lead among foes turning for home, but gave way entering the lane. FARMINGTON
ROAD laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted five wide and between horses entering the lane, but failed to factor. BEAVER HAT bobbled while off
awkwardly, lacked speed four wide, came into the lane seven wide, and made little impact. FIVE STAR GENERAL set the pace along the inside, but
weakened inside of a trio of bidders approaching the five sixteenths pole.
