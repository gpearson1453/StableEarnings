Footnotes
SAI PHAR tracked leader two wide throughout, entered lane in range and reeled in tiring rival under a strong drive to win clear. HAMPTONRUN away well,
cleared easily on the backstretch, continued clear on the turn, extended advantage entering the lane, switched leads approaching the final sixteenth and
shortened strides to get caught in final hundred yards. RAVENCLAW broke a step slow, stalked pace along the inside, continued saving ground through the
turn and into the stretch and improved along the rail to the wire. CINDY bit slow and bumped inside rival at the start, trailed the field on the rail entering the
turn, kept to task on the turn and passed tired rivals in the lane. SISKIYOU SKY stalked leader in between rivals on the backstretch, continued two wide on
the turn, shifted out abruptly, lost momentum and stayed three wide rest of the turn and failed to threaten in the lane. MAMALONA off slow and came out
two paths at the start, recovered well enough to stalk pace two wide on backstretch, continued two wide and came up empty. AROUSING LOVER off slow
and bumped by outside rival at the start, settled off the pace in the three path, entered turn in the three path, floated out by shifting out rival and stayed in
the four path rest of turn and never threatened.

AM YISRAEL CHAI hustled away and cleared, continued clear on the turn and entered lane clear, met bid from rival and held sway. TONY'S BABE chased
clear leader on the backstretch along the inside, continued along the inside on the turn, took aim two wide on the top of the lane and gained on winner
mildly. FOR MY BROTHER tracked leader off the rail on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn, entered lane in the three path and improved to
the wire. LIL'S BIG SHOT stumbled sharply at the start, stalked pace along the inside, continued along off the rail on the turn, and mildly gained to the wire
in the four path. THISONESFORBARRY stalked pace two wide on the backstretch, continued off the rail on the turn and lacked needed rally in the lane
when widest.
