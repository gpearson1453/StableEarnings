Footnotes
MAROON BELLS chased in the five path, was roused from the four path around the turn, took aim from the six path going into the lane, drifted out in the
stretch, and rallied in the final furlong to get up in the final strides. PART THE STARS (GB) prompted the pace from the four path into the turn, bid from the
five path turning into the stretch, ran on and took the lead into the final furlong but was caught by an outer rival late. OOLONG HAI (IRE) led from the three
path into the turn, was cued when headed from the four path entering the lane, dug in in upper stretch, yielded to a pair of outside rivals inside the final
furlong, and just held on the show. HEADING WEST tracked in the three path, was driven from said position into the lane, but finished evenly. MYSTIC
SUNRISE raced from off the pace in the four path, was hustled from the seven path into the lane, drifted inwards, and was one paced. ADELIESE'S SMILE
rated along the inside, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but never threatened. REE trailed into the stretch and was no menace. SCARPIA hit
the side of the gate, stalked along the inside early but was empty turning into the lane.

Footnotes
CHEERS FOR KITTEN pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole, drew clear in midstretch and held on late. MODAZZLE settled
off the pace two wide, angled out in upper stretch and finished well. ETERNAL FLAME broke sharply but quickly dropped back, was forced out entering the
turn, angled into the two path midway around the bend, tipped out in the lane and rallied between foes to gain the show. CORPORATE AFFAIR set the pace
in the two path and weakened in the final furlong. DANGER RANGER failed to menace while racing three wide. EXTRACTION WILL chased the pace from
the rail and faded through the final eighth. ROYAL INTEREST bore out entering the turn, was corrected soon after, raced mostly in the four path and never
threatened. YOUR A MASTERPIECE steadied at the start and was outrun inside. PER THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, MODAZZLE HAS BEEN
DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
CLAY SOLDIER stalked the pace along the inside, was coaxed while tipping out to the five path entering the stretch, ran on and bid going into the final
furlong, and drew past the pacesetter in the final sixteenth. MY LADY JAMES slightly bumped with an inner foe at the start, set an uncontested pace from
the two path, opened up around the turn, was cued from the four path into the stretch, and kept on before yielding to the eventual winner around the
sixteenth pole to finish with place honors. LIVING IN PARADISE chased in the five path, was roused while three wide around the turn, swung out to the
seven path going into the lane, but evened out for show. FIND YOUR PASSION was prompted along in the three path, dropped back between foes around
the turn, cut the corner going into the lane, but flattened. FEISTY SARA rated from the five path into the turn but was never a threat. MURSAL bumped
slightly with an outer foe at the start and trailed throughout from the three to five path.

Footnotes
SHERLYN GO GO stalked the pace three wide, took over leaving the eighth pole, drew clear soon after then held safe under a drive. GEYSER ROAD
settled off the pace while racing three wide, went four wide around the far turn and rallied between foes. CONFER raced well back two wide, swung seven
wide in upper stretch and closed outside. GUARDIAN ANGEL raced in range two and three wide and lacked the needed rally. SOUPER TROPICAL pressed
the pace two wide, took the lead near the quarter pole, led past the eighth pole and weakened through the final furlong. FROSTY O TOOLE hopped at the
start, saved ground off the pace, angled out near the quarter pole and never threatened. KITTENZEN played no factor while racing two and three wide.
MERRY GOLD tracked the pace from the rail and retreated through the lane. CAVU set the pace along the rail, stopped in the lane and was vanned off.

Footnotes
BRACCIO DI FERRO rated along the inside into the turn, was coaxed while shifting out to the six path going into the stretch, bid into the final furlong, and
got up in the final strides. SLIM SLOW SLIDER chased in the five path, ranged up four wide around the turn, tipped back out to bid from the five path at the
top of the lane, ran on and led going into the final furlong, but was nailed by an outer foe at the wire. SEPTEMBERTEN trailed from the six path into the turn,
was driven from the eight path into the stretch, and kept on down the center for show. ADVANCE CASH set the pace from the two path, was hustled while
floating out to the four path going into the lane, and yielded passing the eighth pole. AGARRAMESIPUEDES prompted the pace between foes but backed
up early around the turn. KING RAMOS raced prominently from the four path but gaveway turning into the lane.

APROPOS stalked the pace inside, split rivals two wide leaving the quarter pole and drew off under a drive. THE MRS pressed the pace four and five wide,
was no match for the winner but stayed on to gain the place. IMONRA prompted the pace three wide between foes, could not keep pace with the winner in
upper stretch but held well enough for the show. RO TOWN set a pressured pace along the rail and weakened in the lane. JELLICLE KATZ was hustled
early, pressed the pace two wide between foes and faded through the stretch. TAPITARA saved ground off the pace, angled out in the lane and never
threatened. OCEAN CLUB was off slowly, circled five and six wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. ROSARIO'S
PRAYER was outrun inside.

Footnotes
TRAIN TO ARTEMUS prompted the pace from the four path, took aim from the five path turning into the lane, bid passing the eighth pole, and was driven
clear. FIRENSPICE was bumped and had to steady after the start, trailed from the three path into the turn, was roused while swinging out to the eight path
going into the stretch, and rallied down the center to get up for place. GLITTER UP stalked the pace in the five path, was ridden from the six path into the
lane, and kept on for show. VELOCE BELLA set the pace from the two path, opened up slightly in the four path turning into the lane, and gaveway in the
final furlong. TREVESS hit the gate and bumped rivals on both sides at the start, chased from the three path into the turn, was cued while cutting the corner
into the stretch, but flattened. MONA STELLA rated along the inside, was roused while shifting out to the seven path turning into the lane, but was no factor.
ABUSE OF POWER raced from off the pace in the four path but was no menace. HARD TO CAPTURE was brushed by an outer foe at the start, tracked
from the two path but was empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
CHEERFUL CHARLIE dueled outside of LIVE IS LIFE in the three path to midstretch and drove clear. MASTER OF NONE bumped at the start and again
nearing the first turn, raced two wide between foes in range around both turns, raced three wide between while in tight through the stretch and narrowly
prevailed for the place. BLAMETHEGOODTIMES bumped at the start and again nearing the first turn, raced four wide just behind the pace, continued on
the left lead in the lane and just missed second. LIVE IS LIFE dueled inside of the winner in the two path, could not match strides with that foe from
midstretch, battled between rivals for second through the final sixteenth and just missed. CAPTAIN ANTHONY stalked the pace from the rail, bid inside of
foes in midstretch and just missed the minor awards. CANAL was bumped between foes at the start, steadied along three wide around the first turn, raced in
the five path around the far turn and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
NIKKI NOOTS broke out at the start, rated from the three path, was coaxed while swinging out to the seven path turning into the lane, rallied down the
center, and drew past a trio of inner rivals to get up in the closing stages. TIO TONY raced in midpack from the three path, was driven from the five path into
the stretch, and ran on for place. DOC BALLARD tracked from the four path, was ridden from said position into the lane, and kept on between rivals to get
up late for show. PEOPLE FORCE led from the three path, opened up slightly while tucking into the two path around the far turn, maintained a clear
advantage into the final furlong, but began to tire late and was caught by a trio of outside rivals. BEACHMONT CHARLIE stalked in the two path but was
empty going into the stretch. NAPA DUDE raced from off the pace in the three path but was no threat. BRANDON'S SMILE had an awkward start and
trailed throughout along the inside.
