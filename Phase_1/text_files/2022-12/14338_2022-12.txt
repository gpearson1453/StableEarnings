Footnotes
REVEILLE SONG tracked the pace in the three path, angled five wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in the final strides. LAKESIDE
GETAWAY settled off the early pace while racing three wide, rallied between foes in the lane and just missed between foes. MOONLIGHT VISION stalked
the pace from the rail, got through and took the lead turning for home, kicked clear in midstretch and led until the final strides. WELD HALL raced off the
pace inside and rallied belatedly along the rail. MISS M M pressed the pace between foes in the three path and weakened in the final furlong. ELISSA JOE
failed to menace while racing two wide. LUNA TUNA dueled in the four path to upper, continued on the left lead in the lane and faded. MEGAN MAKIN
MONEY set a pressured pace in the two path and tired in the drive. PINK PARTY PANTS chased the pace five and six wide and came up empty in the lane.
GET STORMIN hopped at the start and was never involved while racing in the four path. CABERNET took an awkward step not long after the start, dropped
far back and trailed in the three path.

Footnotes
READTHETRANSCRIPT broke in and bumped an inner foe at the start, rated from the five path early, shifted to the rail around the turn, bid while cutting the
corner at the top of the lane, drifted out through the stretch, and held on. FEDERAL EXCHANGE steadied between rivals early, stalked from the three path,
was coaxed from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. CAJUN BAYOU raced from wellback in the two path, was hustled going into the turn,
bid from the three path going into the final furlong, and kept on but was herded by the eventual winner outwards and lost a photo for minor rewards to finish
with show honors. PACIFIC LEGEND tracked in the four path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but flattened. GRUNDER'S CALL set the pace
from inside early, was cued around the turn while floating out to the four path entering the lane, and yielded passing the eighth pole. ROYAL ATTITUDE
bumped with an outer rival at the start, pressed two wide early, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but gaveway at the top of the lane. EL GUAPO
was bumped between foes at the start and trailed throughout from the five path.

Footnotes
CABAR SUL rated up close inside, angled out entering the far turn, advanced in the three path around that bend, drifted out in upper stretch, drifted back in
nearing the sixteenth pole, seized command near that point readily drew off while still getting in a bit. MATEO settled off the pace while racing two and three
wide, angled six wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and rallied for the place. READY ON THE LINE set the pace in two path and
yielded near the sixteenth pole. HEART BOY trailed in the two path early, made a strong four wide move into contention around the far turn but failed to
sustain the bid in the lane. DISCREETLY THRIFTY chased the pace three wide for a half, angled to the rail nearing the far turn, chased inside around that
bend and faded in the lane. ARMOR PIERCING played no factor while racing three wide. PRESTON MURRAY was unruly in the paddock, ran off about an
eighth of a mile behind the gate, reared in the gate, broke well, prompted the pace the three path and stopped around the far turn.

Footnotes
TESTED POSITIVE tracked in the two path early, was roused from the four path while chasing TOO MUCH VINO around the turn, bid to the inside of said
rival while being driven from the six path in the final furlong, and got up in closing strides. TOO MUCH VINO broke out at the start and raced off the pace in
the five path, moved up and took over passing the five sixteenths pole, drifted out to the eight path under rousing entering the lane, continued to drift out in
the stretch, and was caught late. CURLIN HUMMINGBIRD broke out at the start, prompted the pace from the three path, bid from said position midway
around the turn, but flattened out in the stretch to show. CARAVANA trailed from the three path going into the turn, moved up while swinging out to the six
path into the stretch, but was no factor. ALWAYS SUN set the pace from inside but yielded midway around the turn. MARISSATHEPRINCESS chased from
the four path early but was never a threat. LADY BOURBON stalked in the five path, was in tight going into the turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
MO HAWK set a rated pace in the two path, drew off around the far turn and held well clear under a drive. INDY LYON saved ground in midpack, slammed
into the rail in upper stretch and rallied inside for the place. EXULT raced off the pace two and three wide, continued on the left lead and repeatedly tried to
lug in through the stretch run and had a mild rally for the show. WALK UP MUSIC chased the winner two wide and lacked the needed rally. EL SOCIO was
off slowly, raced off the pace three and four wide and passed tiring rivals outside. CARAMEL CHIP bumped with STRONG AGAIN after the start, raced in
range three and four wide and lacked a closing bid. THRESHOLD was outrun inside. STRONG AGAIN was bumped soon after the start, chased the pace
three wide and came up empty in the lane. PRINCE MAIOR was shuffled back early, raced off the pace two wide, went four wide around the far turn and
never threatened.

BEDTIME STORY stalked in the three path, took over from said position early around the turn, was cued to open up from the five path entering the lane,
and held sway. ACTION ROSE raced from off the pace in the four path, moved up around the turn and was driven from said position going into the stretch,
and ran on but was second best. PRINCIPIA chased in the two path, was coaxed around the turn, shifted out to the five path at the top of the lane, and
finished evenly for show. PASAJERA rated in the four path, was driven from the five path into the lane, but was one paced. MY BATON ROUGE trailed from
the five path into the turn, swung out to the seven path entering the stretch, but was no factor. AKELA set the pace while under a snug hold from the two
path into the turn but yielded going into the stretch. SEEKINGBYTHESTORM tracked in the four path, was asked around the turn, and was empty going into
the stretch.

Footnotes
HIERRO stalked the pace two wide, continued on the left lead in the lane, took over between foes nearing the eighth pole and inched ahead under a drive.
DOUBLE TOUGH TIGER bobbled at the break, tracked the pace three wide, bid outside of the winner nearing the eighth pole but was turned back by that
foe. TONE FEELIN was lightly bumped at the start, raced off the pace three and four wide and was along for the show. KING THEO chased the pace two
wide and lacked the needed rally. POSITIVELY AWESOME was lightly bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane
and tired. PROSPECT PROJECT broke outwardly and made light contact with POSITIVELY AWESOME then was outrun inside. ADDED FRACTIONS AND
CHANGED FINAL TIME FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
HROTHGAR pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead while in the two path around the far turn, was headed by an outer rival while being driven
from the four path into the lane, dug in and drifted out through the final furlong, and held on. T VILLE prompted the pace in the four path early, bid from the
three path around the far turn, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, ran on while being floated out in the final furlong, and hung late to place. HEY
PORTER was slow into stride and trailed from three wide around the first turn, tracked from the five path down the backstretch, was roused from the four
path around the far turn, and kept on in the stretch for show. GHOSTINYOU chased in the three path, was cued from the two path around the far turn, and
stayed on in the stretch but was outkicked for minor rewards. SUN VIKING rated along the inside but never threatened. MY WAY OR NO WAY set the pace
from inside but gaveway rounding the far turn.

from there to the quarter pole and tired. REACHING STRIDE was outrun inside. LAVEAU steadied along early, bumped SPIRIT OF POWER midway
around the first turn, checked not long after, saved ground and never threatened. DELTA RED chased the pace four wide, stopped after a half and was
