Footnotes
KITTEN'S MAN rated close toward the inside, started a bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, came between horses two deep approaching the head of the
lane, took over past the eighth pole, drew clear mid-stretch and drew away the final sixteenth. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL stalked from the three path, took the
nod at the seven sixteenths pole and drew clear past the quarter, but was met just inside the eighth pole and had to settle for second best. AMEN CORNER
veered out leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn in the four path, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced four and five wide on the far turn and
came along for third mid-stretch. MEGA MILLIONS was forced out leaving the gate then saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase approaching the
five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and ran evenly in the lane. FIND YOUR BOAZ saved ground on the first turn, gave chase from the seven
sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled to the five path nearing the head of the lane but showed little further. GOLDEN ANSWER was
shuffled back at the start and rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then
flattened stride. ELLIE'S LIL MAN tapered in and took the lead nearing the three quarter pole, was met at the seven sixteenths, gave chase from that point,
raced near the rail on the far turn then weakened.

Footnotes
IRISH SAMURAI stalked off the rail from the half mile pole, challenged toward the three eighths pole and raced at a close disadvantage two deep on the far
turn, dueled for the lead toward mid-stretch and widened through later yards. AT THE GATE closed to the front approaching the three quarter pole and
moved to the inside on the first turn, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was met
mid-stretch and flattened the final sixteenth. SERIOUS MOMENT settled back off the rail on the first turn then eased outward into the backstretch, started a
bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. CAN'T FIGURE raced well back in the four path the first turn,
gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little further. MIDNIGHT IN PRAGUE saved ground on the first turn,
picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail then weakened. SHE SO COOL raced well back off the rail on the first
turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path, entered the stretch outside and passed rivals. REGGAETONI
raced off the rail on the first turn, eased out entering the backstretch and showed little response. BODIE'S STORM saved ground. MYGIDGETMARIE
settled off the rail the first turn, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole then weakened in the four path of the far turn.
