Footnotes
METAPHYSICAL prompted the pace from the three path, was in the four path around the far turn and cued to bid going into the lane, dueled with the
pacesetter into the final sixteenth before edging away in final strides to win. MADEMOISELLEJACKIE set the pace in the two path early, was coaxed when
headed from the three path entering the lane, dueled with the winner into the final sixteenth, but was edged out late to finish with place honors.
PENUMBRAS MAKER tracked the pace in the three path, was roused from the five path entering the stretch, and ran on for show. TIGER TAP raced in
midpack from the four path, moved up while swinging out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on down the center. SUN BEE stalked from the
two path early, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but finished evenly. R ROSE' ALL DAY got bumped on both sides at the start, saved ground
around the first turn, rated from the three path thereafter, was driven from the five path going into the stretch, but was one paced. EVIE DOES IT bumped an
inner rival at the start, had to steady from the two path around the first turn, trailed from the four path down the backstretch, and was no factor from the
seven path in the stretch. ZIPADOO hopped at the start then bumped an outer rival shortly after, chased along the inside but never threatened.
CLAUDETTE'S LADY was bumped between and squeezed back at the start, and never able to menace from the five path. JUST NORTH raced prominently
from the five path but backed up around the far turn.

the pace in the two path around the first turn, dueled inside of the winner around the far turn and through midstretch and held well to preserve the place.
ROSE E HOLIDAY stalked the pace from the rail around the first turn, chased in the two path rounding the far turn and finished evenly to maintain the show.
DIVINE EXCHANGE raced off the pace three wide, bid four deep rounding the far turn and flattened out in the lane. ZODIAC PRINCESS tracked the pace
three and four wide and faded in the lane. LOVIN LIVIN failed to menace while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
CANDY LIGHT was in the three path around the first turn, rated between foes thereafter, shifted out to the seven path entering the lane, rallied to bid
passing the eighth pole, and drew past an inner foe in the final furlong. SURPRISINGLY raced from off the pace along the inside, swung out to the eight
path into the stretch, chased home the winner, and got up for place honors inside the final sixteenth. PERSONAL BEST stalked in the two path, bid three
wide passing the quarter pole, led from the five path at the top of the stretch, but drifted out and was caught by a pair of oncoming outside rivals in the final
furlong to finish with show honors. SPIRIT AND GLORY (IRE) chased in the four path early, was ridden from the seven path into the stretch, drifted in, and
was one paced. GUNESH prompted the pace while hard held in the three path but faded from the five path in upper stretch. JUMEIRAH threw her head at
the start, trailed from the three path into the stretch, and was no factor. MY PHILLY TWIRL tracked from the three path but was empty going into the stretch.
OMIXOCHITL set the pace from inside but gaveway at the top of the lane.

LOCO ABARRIO vied two wide down the backstretch, drew clear in the two path around the turn and widened under a moderate drive in the lane.
KHOZEIRESS raced off the early pace outside, advanced five wide around the turn and ran on to gain the place. POWER HUMOR chased the winner four
wide, was no match in the lane and held well enough for the show. UNCAPTURED STAR dueled inside of the winner early, chased inside around the turn
and lacked a closing bid. CAPTURE THE LION prompted the pace three wide and tired in the drive. THE KHOZAN ONE failed to menace while racing two
wide. MR. RHODIUM broke awkwardly then was shut off at the start, saved ground and never threatened. DONTKISSDAMINISTER was outrun while racing
four wide. ORGANIST played no factor while racing three wide.

Footnotes
LAY THE GROUNDWORK chased in the four path, loomed up from the five path around the far turn, was cued to bid from the seven path into the lane,
swept to the lead going into the final furlong and held sway. SALS DREAM GIRL rated in the four path, swung out to the eight path turning into the stretch,
and ran on for place. ECONOMIC HANGOVER trailed from the two path, shifted out and was driven from the eight path into the stretch, and kept on down
the center for show. CHARMED WAY raced prominently from the three path, was roused to take the lead from the four path into the stretch, but flattened
passing the eighth pole. JUDGE JUDITH stalked along the inside into the turn, was in tight between foes around the five sixteenths pole, and was tired.
DEMOGORGON set the pace from inside but yielded going into the stretch. BUILT DIFFERENT took a hop step along the inside into the first turn, was held
up from the two path down the backstretch, got forced to steady near the five sixteenths pole, and never threatened.

Footnotes
GOLDEN GLIDER settled off the early pace inside, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, swung eight wide turning for home, closed
determinedly and was up on the wire. STEADY ON set the pace in the two path, ceded the lead down the backstretch, continued on the two path around the
far turn, regained command near the five-sixteenths marker, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under right-handed urging and was nailed on the wire.
DAKOTA GOLD settled off the pace while racing three wide between foes, went two wide around the far turn, bid inside of STEADY ON near the sixteenth
pole, battled to the wire and was narrowly outfinished. FORT WASHINGTON was off slowly, trailed in the three path for a half, advanced between foes
around the far turn, swung widest in upper stretch and finished fastest off all. GRAND SONATA raced two wide in midpack and had a mild stretch rally.
AXTHELM stalked the pace from the rail to midstretch and weakened. CHURCHTOWN talked the pace four wide, bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and
faded in the lane. RED DANGER checked entering the first turn, saved ground off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. GRAND
DAVID broke a bit awkwardly, raced five wide around both turns and made little impact. NIGHT JUMPER prompted the pace three wide around the first turn,
took the lead on the backstretch, vied in the three path around the far turn and tired in the drive. STOLEN BASE failed to menace while racing three and four
wide. NATIVE THUNDER had some speed five wide around the first turn but was through after a half.

PEACHY WEACHY tracked in the six path, was ridden from the three path around the turn, tipped back out to the six path going into the stretch, and rallied
in the final furlong to get up in closing strides. AWESOME INDRA set an open pace in the five path, tucked in to the two path around the turn and was cued
from said position going into the lane, began to shorten stride passing the eighth pole, and was caught by a late charging outer foe to get place honors.
PENS STREET chased in the seven path, was coaxed from the five path around the turn, floated out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and was one
paced for show. NINJA ABARRIO broke in at the start, trailed from inside going into the stretch, and never threatened. KAEKO stalked in the three path,
was hustled from the two path around the turn, but faded from the seven path in the stretch.

Footnotes
BACKCHAT bumped with MISTER J T at the start, raced off the early pace two wide, circled five wide around the far turn, seized command nearing the
eighth pole and powered clear. BADBADBOBBY tracked the pace two and three wide, was in some traffic nearing the head of the lane, angled to the rail in
midstretch and rallied for the place. SIR SAMUEL raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied between foes to gain the show. EL SEGUNDO raced off
the pace three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and evened out in the final furlong. BOARD CERTIFIED lacked early speed while racing three
wide, made good progress four wide around the far turn, bid between foes in upper stretch and flattened out soon after. QUANTUM THEORY saved ground
off the early pace, went five wide around the far turn and never threatened. FEDERAL EXCHANGE pressed the pace in the three path around the first turn
and two wide around the far turn and faded in the lane. EDEN PARADISE tracked the pace three wide, took the lead near the five-sixteenths pole and tired
in the lane. DANLEY failed to menace while racing four and five wide. MISTER J T was bumped at the start, set the pace along the rail and gave way near
the five-sixteenths pole. TWELVE O'CLOCK trailed inside.
