Footnotes
ASLUCKWOULDHAVIT was bumped at the start, then went up and cleared to set the pace, then widened the margin leaving the quarter pole and drew off
in the lane to prove much the best under mild urging. PERUVIAN BOY chased the early pace four wide, then made a mild bid three wide on the turn and
kept on to be second best. CALCULATED THINKIN was allowed to settle early, made a four wide move on the turn but flattened out, held show award.
KITTEN'S SOLUTION tracked the pace between rivals early, then was two wide on the turn and faded, missed show award. LEAVE 'EM LOADED chased
the pace on the inside and weakened. THE RIGHT PATH broke outwardly at the start, failed to menace. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
MYSTIC LINK was well rated on the inside, eased out on the turn and came four wide into the lane, closed well and got up late to prevail, driving.
EXCURSION stumbled badly at the start, relegated to trail the field early, advanced three to four wide on the turn and came five wide into the lane, closed
well but was outfinished by the winner, got place award. FRIENDLY FELLA stumbled at the start, quickly recovered and went up to prompt the pace three
wide on the first turn, made a two wide bid on the turn and drew clear by the quarter pole, then opened up by the furlong marker, but was caught late and
lost the place award on the wire. WENTZ set the pace on the inside and was headed by the five sixteenths and then angled off the inside leaving the turn
and faded. CHARGING LION chased the pace two wide and tired. ILLUSTRIOUS was settled early and tired.

MEET THE ELITE dueled for the early lead two wide, made a bid to draw clear on the turn, then drew off in the lane to prove much the best under mild
urging. ON AN ISLAND stalked the early pace three to four wide, angled in leaving the quarter pole, then finished willingly to just miss the place award.
SECRET ADDICTION dueled for the lead on the inside, then chased the winner on the turn and shifted off the inside leaving the quarter pole and held the
place late. MACHO HONCHO was reserved early, advanced two wide on the tutrn and had a belated rally on the inside. OUR MARK STEVEN was off a bit
slow and hit the gate coming out, was far back early, came wide into the lane and showed a late rally. BOOK RUNNER was settled back early, came five
wide into the lane and improved late. WHISKIED UP was settled early on the inside and weakened. DON'T QUESTION ME was four to five wide pursuit
early and tired. CAN'T STOP MAXEY chased the pace four wide and stopped.

the inside and got up in time to prove best, driving. MAHOMES MONEY was soon clear and opened up a bid lead early, then shifted off the inside leaving
the turn and was still clear by the furlong marker but was denied late to just miss. NAUTICAL NATURE chased the pace and advanced two wide and came
three wide into the drive but flattened out. OBROTHER ITSYLVIA was reserved early, advanced five wide by the quarter pole and came wide into the ;lane
and had a mild late rally. DAKOTA OUTLAW was settled and was three to four wide on the turn and had n o kick. CHROME FINISH was allowed to settle
on the inside and had no rally. WICKED CRAZY was settled between rivals early, made a mild bid three wide on the turn and came four wide into the drive

Footnotes
TOOTSYSROCKNROLLER was rated along early on the inside, eased out midway on the turn and came four wide into the lane while advancing, closed
well on the outside and edged away to prove best under a drive. BLIND SIGHT was off a step slow, then stalked the pace four wide and made a three wide
bid leaving the turn, gained a short lead leaving the furlong marker but was outkicked by the winner, second best. SIMPLE SOUVENIR broke in the air at
the start, then advanced four wide on the turn, then needed more late, bested rest. LA LENA cleared early and dropped to the inside on the turn and then
was headed at the furlong marker and weakened. OUR JESSICA JOAN chased the early pace on the inside, then shifted out at the three eighths marker
and weakened.
