Footnotes
TOTAL MALICE rushed clear, enjoyed a wide lead in the two path, and was driven to inch further away through the lane. ROMANTIC BEAST chased along
the inside, slipped inside of rival entering the lane to bid for place along with an outer foe, then drifted out through upper stretch after securing the position,
but was only second best. IZEONPOINT tracked in midpack two to three wide, bid for place entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival in upper
stretch. SUFFRAGETTE lacked speed three wide, and improved without menacing. HAVINFUNYET was off slowly, trailed in the three path around the
turns, shifted to the five path in upper stretch, and also failed to factor while moving up. ZANDREA'S stalked the run off leader in the three path early on, but
failed to progress despite urging in the two path around the far turn, and weakened between horses at the quarter pole. VITA laid off of the pace along the
inside, was outrun around the far turn, and eased through the lane

Footnotes
HALF MAGIC bumped an outer rival at the start, set a clear pace from a pair of pressers around the turn, held sway from them through midstretch, then
lasted late from an outer oncharging foe while tiring. LIL WOADIE lacked speed in the three to four paths around the turn despite steady urging from the
rider, then sustained stride through midstretch, shifted out in the final sixteenth while closing in on the tiring top trio, but just ran out of ground to reel in the
leader while reaching place. TRADER PRICE took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked the leader from the three path while outside of another
chasing rival, sparred for place with that foe while failing to progress on the pace setter through the lane, gained place in the final furlong, but was
outfinished by an outer rival for that position late. RISKTAKER was bumped by an inner foe into an outer rival at the start, chased the leader form the two
path while vying for place inside of a foe, the sustained the battle for that position through the lane, but was outfinished while yielding late. BASTI BLUE
broke slowly despite heavy urging from the rider, trailed along the inside, and made little impact. CIGAR VAN broke a step slow, raced far back in the four to
five paths, and was outrun.

Footnotes
SMARTY ALEX trailed along the inside, was held up behind a wall of traffic turning for home, split rivals four wide in upper stretch, rallied with a clear
DUVEE to catch in the final furlong, and reeled in that rival late. DUVEE set the pace, sparred with an outer rival down the backstretch and through the far
turn, kicked clear of him in upper stretch, opened up to a wide margin in midstretch, but was worn down by an outer on-charging rival in the closing stages.
MO CREDO raced at the rear two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, yet stayed on through the lane to gain show from an outer foe
approaching the final sixteenth. AUTUMNS STRONG MAN pressed three wide into the first turn, vied two wide down the backstretch, sustained the battle
around the far turn, but weakened in upper stretch. GUTZY prompted the pace two wide and between horses, allowed those foes to go forward to stalk
outside

entering
the
backstretch,
but
failed
to
keep
pace
despite
rider's

RUNNINGINTHEMONEY laid off of the pace three wide, then four to five wide around the far turn, and made little impact. SINGLE SHOT saved ground

Footnotes
ISOLATION was fractious when first tried for loading, stalked along the inside, patiently awaited racing room from the pocket in the tightly grouped field
around the far turn, split foes four wide coming to midstretch to bid at the furlong grounds, drove clear soon after, and held sway from an outer chaser.
BELLAMY CAY trailed while kept in the four path around the first turn, got hung five wide around the far turn, fanned to the seven path while inching closer
entering the lane, then stayed on to claim place in the final furlong, and chased the leader home well. SPELLBINDING settled off of the pace in the three
path, ranged up four wide turning for home to be within striking range entering the turn, but was outkicked while floated five wide by an inner rival, and kept
on. EXPLOSIVELY HOT stalked outside of the top pair, bid for the lead around the far turn, led turning for home, but was outkicked by outer rivals leaving
the furlong grounds, and weakened. FASHION MERIT set the pace inside of a vying rival, got headed by an outer bidder turning for home, and gave way.
MY LITTLE JEN got a bit antsy awaiting the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, swung to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. CALAJA vied
for the lead two wide, but was headed by an outer bidder approaching the quarter pole, and weakened. GREAT IN RED was fractious in the starting gate,
then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
OVERTHOUGHT stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair and to the five path to take aim entering the lane, kicked past them in upper
stretch, and drew clear. MAX PANDOWDY broke a step slowly, settled off of the pace along the inside, tracked around the far turn, gradually shifted outside
of the top flight through upper stretch, then chased the clearing leader home while gaining place at the sixteenth pole. OKUDAH vied for the lead outside of
the pace setter while kept in the four path by that foe, stalked down the backstretch, re-bid at the three furlong pole before wrestling an advantage turning for
home, but was outkicked by a looming rival leaving the quarter pole, and lost place entering the final sixteenth. LUCKY CRUSADER trailed in the three to
four paths around the turns, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. PLEMMONSTON lacked speed two wide and between horses, and made
little impact. ROOSTER RUN set the pace inside of a prompting foe while remaining multiple paths off of the inside, inched clear down the backstretch, but
was headed by his outer counterpart's re-bid turning for home, and weakened. BLURT tracked in the four path, but only managed to chase the leader
around the far turn before tiring through the lane. DA GOLD ROOM laid off of the pace three wide, then trailed along the inside around the far turn, and was
outrun.

Footnotes
KLIMTOMANIAC was bumped and bothered by an inner foe at the start, settled far back in the two path, saved ground around the far turn, shifted out in
upper stretch while closing in on the tiring leaders, rallied to produce a bid outside of SOFT PANTS nearing the final sixteenth, got bumped and herded out
by that foe while sparring through the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. SOFT PANTS was slammed by an inner rival causing him to squarely bump an
outer foe at the start, tracked three wide, loomed a danger while ranging up outside of the leading pair turning for home, bid in upper stretch, led at the
furlong grounds, dug in to resist KLIMTOMANIAC's bid nearing the final sixteenth, but drifted out while doing so, bumped that rival while battling through the
late stages, and was denied at the wire. SIMPLY WOW shied from an inner rival at the start, tracked in midpack along the inside, but faded despite urging
around the far turn, somehow regained stride while shifting to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on for a minor share. CREATIVE STRATEGY
stalked two wide, bid entering the far turn, led at the three furlong pole, dug in to meet SOFT PANT's bid approaching midstretch, but was headed at the
furlong grounds, and yielded. LA BOUCANE dangerously veered out many paths at the start, severely bumped SOFT PANTS while causing trouble for all at
the except CREATIVE STRATEGY in the process, went on to set the pace, but was headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened through the lane while
hanging on his left lead. MR MAJESTIC broke a beat slow before being bothered by inner rivals soon after the start, lacked speed in the four path, and tired.
GLUCKSTADT steadied when an inner rival cut across his path at the start, then lagged well behind before mildly narrowing the gap on the rest in the late
stages. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE START, LA BOUCANE WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SEVENTH.

NELSON AVENUE bumped with an inner rival before bumping an outer foe at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter and from the three path, bid at the
seven sixteenths pole, vied around the far turn, then from between horses as outer rivals ranged up turning for home, shook clear of them at the quarter
pole, held sway before being confronted by BRITAIN'S KITTEN's bid nearing the final sixteenth, drifted out and bumped that foe soon after, yet gamely
repelled him late. BRITAIN'S KITTEN rated at the rear two wide, circled inner rivals while rallying in the five path around the far turn, took aim on a clearing
NELSON AVENUE leaving the quarter pole, chased before grinding into his margin in the final furlong, produced a bid at the sixteenth pole sparking a duel,
but got bumped by that rival soon after, and was turned away. MINNESOTA READY bumped with an outer rival at the start, raced at the rear along the
inside, shifted out around the far turn, then to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on. DOCTOR NASH laid off of the pace in the three to two path
around the first turn, tracked from between horses around the far turn, shifted three to four wide while among foes in upper stretch, but lacked a kick to
produce a bid, then kept on in the final furlong. SMOKEY HARBOR tracked outside of the top pair and from the four path, pressed entering the far turn, bid
turning for home, but weakened between horses entering the lane. SLIM MAN took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked along the inside while
tugging in the bit under a snug hold around the first turn, settled in the pocket soon soon after, but was shuffled back behind the tiring early-pace setter
nearing the lane, and gave way. SHIPPINGPORT set the pace in the two path, showed as the eventual winner bid entering the far turn, got headed by that
foe and another bidder at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
RELIC HUNTER cleared an inner rival at the half mile pole, showed the way uncontested while well in hand around the turn, and held sway through the
lane. FIELD OF VISION laid off of the pace three wide, gained four wide turning for home, rallied while flopping back to his left lead nearing the final
sixteenth, and reached place late. CHECK ME OUT bumped an outer rival leaving the gates, laid close up inside of the pace setter, altered course outside
of him at the half mile, stalked around the turn, chased through the lane, then was outkicked for place late. BIG BOO tracked along the inside, and chased
evenly. INFINITESIMAL was last away from the gates, laid off of the pace along the inside while held up behind a foe around the turn, came into the lane
two wide, shifted to the four path in upper stretch, and failed to threaten. HEZA CHAIN BREAKER took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked two
wide, but lugged inwardly while failing to keep pace at the quarter pole, and weakened. RUN ON ACES was outrun. GO BROTHER GO lacked speed two
wide and between horses, but was done nearing the lane, and eased thereafter.
