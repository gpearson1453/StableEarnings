Footnotes
SOUPER DUPER READY settled off the early pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed outside, was up nearing the
sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. MARIA'S HONOR was reluctant to load, was shut off at the start, trailed inside, briefly angled four wide near the
five-sixteenths pole, angled back in soon after, tipped out in upper stretch and surged between foes late to gain the place in the final strides. BOSTON
PRINCESS raced off the pace three wide, steadied near the quarter pole, swung seven wide in upper stretch, closed outside, switched back to the left lead
late and was outfinished for the place. ANDIE ONE raced two wide in midpack, advanced between foes rounding the far turn, was on heels in upper stretch
and in a bit tight inside of foes through the lane. STELLARATOR raced off the early pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and was one-paced
through the lane. RIGBY veered in at the start, stalked the pace in the three path, took over near the quarter pole, lugged in in upper stretch, led to the
sixteenth pole and weakened from there. OAXACA raced in range three wide, bid in midstretch but faded through the final furlong. IT'S NORA NOW had
some speed inside and steadily faded. ROUGH ENOUGH saved ground and failed to menace. OOOH BARRACUDA set the pace in the path and retreated
through the lane. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
BAD HENRY rated from the two path, had to steady going into the turn, angled out to the four path and made a commanding bid while in hand passing the
five sixteenths pole, took over and was cued to open up entering the lane, and was driven clear. ANTILLEAN tracked in the three path, tipped out to the four
path under rousing going into the stretch, was no match for the winner but kept on to secure place. CAPT COMPLICATED stalked along the inside, shifted
out to the five path going into the stretch, and finished evenly for show. MOUSEFAST hit the outer side of the gate at the start, chased in the five path, was
coaxed to bid from the three path passing the five sixteenths pole, floated out to the six path going into the stretch, but faded. FLORIDA STAR raced from
behind in the six path and never threatened. ALDO'S DREAM set the early pace under a hold from the four path but gaveway passing the five sixteenths
pole.

Footnotes
DOWNTON TABBY tracked the pace two and three wide, took over near the quarter pole and readily drew off while ridden out. HOTTER THAN JULY
stalked the pace three wide, took the lead near the three-eighths pole, drew clear and angled in midway around the far turn, was collared by the winner near
the quarter pole, could not keep pace with that foe but stayed on to be clearly second best. WHAT KNOT raced off the pace two wide and was along the for
the show. SHE'S OUTTA HERE was rank early, trailed inside, went three to four wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. SHES A GIFT was in
range while racing three wide, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. BLAME THE VETS dueled two wide for a half, chased inside
around the far turn and had little left for the drive. SOUTH PACIFIC dueled inside for a half and retreated.

SINGING THE OLDIES raced prominently from the four path into the the turn, took aim under coaxing around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering
the stretch, bid going into the final furlong, took the lead and held off a late challenge from TOO MUCH VINO inside the final sixteenth to win. TOO MUCH
VINO tracked in the five path, loomed up from the six path under urging turning into the stretch, ran on to bid into the final furlong, but was repelled by the
winner late to place. OASIS JAK set the pace in the three path was driven from the two path into the stretch, but yielded to a pair of outer foes inside the
final furlong to finish with show honors. STEPHANIE MY LOVE chased in the three path, was ridden from the seven path going into the stretch, but was no
factor. MARISSATHEPRINCESS trailed early, was in the two path entering the lane, but was no threat. CURLIN HUMMINGBIRD stalked along the inside
but faded from the five path turning into the stretch. LADY BOURBON was wellback in the four path early, swung out to the eight path entering the lane, but
was no menace.

Footnotes
THERAPIST got bumped between rivals at the start and had to steady into the first turn, rated in the five path, loomed up from the six path around the far
turn, rallied to bid in upper stretch, and drew clear in the final furlong. RED HORNET slightly bumped with MARITIME WINGS at the start, stalked the pace
from the two path, had to steady from inside around the three eighth's point, was angled out to the six path going into the stretch, and ran on for place.
MARITIME WINGS (IRE) bumped with RED HORNET at the start then THERAPIST shortly after, tracked from the two path, steadied slightly passing the
three eighth's point, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, and kept on to secure show honors. MASTEROFTHESENATE got bumped by
CAUSIN' MAYHEM out of the gate, chased from the five path, was in the three path around the far turn, got bumped back out to the five path by CAUSIN'
MAYHEM in upper stretch, and evened out in the final furlong. CAUSIN' MAYHEM bumped MASTEROFTHESENATE at the start, prompted the early pace
from the three path, bid from the two path around the far turn, briefly led passing the quarter pole, bumped with MASTEROFTHESENATE again in upper
stretch, and faded. LORENZ (BRZ) raced prominently from the three path but flattened in the stretch. ON THIN ICE raced in midpack from the four path,
had to steady slightly passing the three eighth's pole, floated out to the nine path entering the lane, but was tired. FATHER GLADO bumped with
THERAPIST at the start, raced from wellback in the four path early and never factored from the five path in the stretch. BATTLE SCARS trailed from the six
path into the stretch, and never threatened. TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND raced off the pace in the six path early but was no menace. WAR TERMINATOR
broke in and bobbled at the start, recovered to set the early pace in the two path, but gaveway along the rail turning into the lane. TIMES CHANGED
