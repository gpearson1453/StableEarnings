Footnotes
CLASSIC LEGACY established good position early, moved out outside the five-eighths, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three then four
path on the turn, gained to make a bid outside the five-sixteenths, took the lead into the stretch, shook clear into the final furlong, extended the advantage
under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. YORKSHIRE PRINCE was hustled from the gate, chased the pace down the
backstretch, raced inside early on the turn then moved to the two path, made a bid inside of two foes outside the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive, lost touch with the winner inside the furlong marker and proved no match then held the place while drifting out late. ONE BITE moved out
while urged along off the pace, went four then five wide around the turn, gained near the five-sixteenths, was driven six wide into the stretch and lacked the
needed response while well clear for the show. BEARINGS stumbled after the start, dropped well behind under urging, went three wide on the turn and was
no factor. BATTLEFIELD PARK was last to commence then hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two then three path
around the turn, came under attack outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage near the quarter-pole and faded.

Footnotes
MIDTOWN LIGHTS broke out at the start under hustling and bumped BANDULU QUEEN, chased five then four wide, went five wide into upper stretch,
rallied to take command a furlong out, edged away to the finish kept to task. FEMA FUNDS showed the way in hand three then two wide, got set down four
wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat and was collared a furlong out, ran on to secure the place honors. LOON CRY broke in at the start under
coaxing and took over the lane of HAPPY'S SMILE, chased four then three wide, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and kept on to procure the show
honors. SWEET LIBERTY chased just off the inside until tucked inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside
into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. HAPPY'S SMILE lost her lane at the start when rivals each broke her way, raced six paths off the inside down
the backstretch and then three wide through the turn, tipped four wide into upper stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT ROSIE chased six then five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went six to seven wide into upper stretch, made no impact. PRETTY MISS KEENS broke out at the start under coaxing,
chased three wide under a ride from the five-sixteenths, continued three wide for home and tired. BANDULU QUEEN bumped at the start by MIDTOWN
LIGHTS, who broke outwards, chased four paths off the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went five wide into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
DIVA BANKER was last to commence, settled on the outside, gained while asked in the four path on the turn, made a five wide bid into upper stretch, took a
short lead near the eighth-pole, dueled with the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed under steady urging. QUALITY STONES went to the
front, showed the way down the backstretch, controlled the action in the two path around the turn, spun three wide into the stretch then was challenged by
the winner, lost the advantage to that foe near the eighth-pole, fought on in the final furlong, drifted out late and just missed while well clear for the place.
BEAUTIFUL KAREN chased the pace down the backstretch, went three wide on the turn, dropped back while floating six wide into the stretch and
weakened while clear for the show. VIRADIA chased the pace down the backstretch, dropped back while inside on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two
path under the crop then drifted out and tired. DANCINGWTHDAFFODLS was taken back on the inside then guided to the outside at the rear, went five
wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and was no factor.

Footnotes
JULIA SHINING bobbled at the break brushing with ROYAL SPA before being lightly taken in hand as rivals crossed over in front from the outside, went two
then three wide through the first turn before settling five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, came under prolonged coaxing half a mile from
home and went five wide through the turn ridden along and coming under the crop for the initial time just outside the quarter pole, angled six to seven wide
at the head of the stretch, rallied to steadily gain outside rivals issuing a challenge to knock heads with AFFIRMATIVE LADY taking narrow command a
sixteenth out, then gamely dug in to prevail on the wire. AFFIRMATIVE LADY just off the inside through the first turn, chased five then four wide coming
under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in under threat and was collared a
sixteenth from home, fought on game to the finish to preserve the place honors. GAMBLING GIRL broke out at the start bumping TRIBAL QUEEN, raced
three then two wide through the first turn before settling three to four paths off the rail at the tail of the field, came under coaxing at the three-eighths three
wide, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, issued a challenge a furlong from home to be heads apart for command briefly, then ran on to chase the
top pair home while clear of the rest for the show honors. ROYAL SPA coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths,
continued three wide for home, seized narrow and brief command just inside the three-sixteenths before being headed by AFFIRMATIVE LADY, then
weakened in the late stages. LA VITA SOFIA just off the inside through the first turn, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. FOGGY NIGHT coaxed from the gate, climbed and hopped along down inside into the first turn before
settling, chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced and took the inside route into upper stretch propelling herself to a
narrow and brief cameo appearance taking command at the three-sixteenths before being displaced by ROYAL SPA, then backed away and tired to the
finish. TRIBAL QUEEN bumped at the start by GAMBLING GIRL, who broke outwards, showed the way in hand just off the inside coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and was displaced from the front straightened away, then folded and was eased home to
the finish.

near the half-mile pole, dropped back four then five wide around the far turn and came up empty. MIDNIGHT TROUBLE jostled with a foe at the start, was
taken in hand early, went three wide on the first turn, was rated just off the pace, dropped back under urging while three then four wide on the far turn and
capitulated. IL MIRACOLO broke in then tossed his head while taken up with a right-rein correction, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled
outside at the rear down the backstretch, was roused near the half-mile pole, went five then six wide on the far turn and failed to respond. PROVE RIGHT
was hustled from the gate then taken in hand nearing the first turn, pulled under restraint in the two path around the first turn, was keen coming to the
three-quarter pole then rated just off the pace down the backstretch, chased while shifting from the two path to the four path around the final turn and
faltered.

Footnotes
MIND CONTROL was coaxed from the gate to establish early position, tracked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path midway through the
turn, gained to make a bid at the quarter-pole then took the lead into upper stretch, fought gamely with a duo to the wire and narrowly prevailed under strong
handling. GET HER NUMBER was urged along on the outside, gained four wide on the turn, made a bid coming to the quarter-pole, battled outside of two
foes in the stretch and was denied while able to get the place. WHITE ABARRIO was well placed down the backstretch, came under urging near the
seven-sixteenths, went around most of turn in the two path then dropped to the rail, gained to make a bid into upper stretch, fought on well inside of the top
two to the wire but missed while clear for the show. ZANDON settled towards the rear, was roused leaving the backstretch, went three wide around the turn,
swung six wide into the stretch, pursued the top trio on the far outside and lacked the needed kick. OUTLIER brushed with a rival after the start, showed the
way with a clear advantage, rounded the turn in the two path, was headed into the stretch and weakened. DOUBLE CROWN settled at the rear, saved
ground early on the turn then moved to the two path, shifted four wide before the five-sixteenths, came five wide into upper stretch and lacked the needed
response.

Footnotes
ROYAL TRYST hustled from the gate, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch from near the rear of the field, tucked to the two path
into the turn and came under coaxing half a mile from home, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive steadily gaining through the
length of the stretch and was just up in the final jumps to prevail. TENEBRIS established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside down the
backstretch before being engaged by MAJOR SPIN into the turn, dueled with that rival to his outside through the bend and continued in the inside route into
upper stretch, got headed for the front straightened away, dug in under a drive tenaciously coming back to take command once more seventy yards from
home, then got nailed in the final jumps to the wire. MAJOR SPIN hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader early on
before advancing on that rival to knock heads through the turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and seized command straightened away, dug
in continuing to battle through the stretch and was headed seventy yards from home, fought on to the end to preserve the show honors. COLLOQUY
chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the three-eighths, angled three to four wide
into upper stretch and kept on to secure the last major share. GASLIGHT chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five to six
wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SKYLANDER chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled six wide
into upper stretch and made no headway. SEMPER FIDELIS hustled from the gate, chased four to five wide down the backstretch and through the turn
coaxed along from the seven-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch, offered no response. WHAT A DUDE chased three to four wide under
coaxing from three furlongs out, went six wide at the head of the stretch, tired.
