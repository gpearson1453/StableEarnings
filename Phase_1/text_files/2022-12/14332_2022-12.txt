rivals advancing on the final turn and continued well. OVERTHEBLUESKY prompted the pace three wide then faltered after five furlongs. CHARLYS WILD

EL HERMANO prompted pace in hand, earned a narrow lead in midstretch then edged off while kept to his task. MR THRIFTY urged to the lead inside, vied
through the final turn and continued willingly. WHAT'S TO BLAME lacked speed, advanced wide and was up for the show award late. STAY HYDRATED
split rivals to challenge into the far turn, dueled with a brief lead then tired. GRIT'N'GRIND lagged far behind then narrowed the gap wide while no threat.
TRIPLE JEOPARDY was reserved between foes early then chased inside and faded. PETULANT DELIGHT flashed speed outside then was finished after
half a mile.

TOPS THE CHART stalked close up two wide, the pressed the pacesetter, bid on the far turn, took over at the quarter pole, drew clear, drifted out in the
final sixteenth and held well under urging. EDGE OF GLORY set the pace on the inside, dueled with the winner on the far turn, chased that rival in upper
stretch, then dug in gamely outside and battled on determinedly to the end. BE ONBOARD stalked three wide, chased on the far turn, lacked a rally and
held on for third. BEACHWALKER raced off the pace inside, advanced inside entering the far turn and finished evenly in the stretch. ASHAAB pulled in the
early stages, raced two wide off the pace and failed to threaten. BODE O tracked on the inside early on, then chased inside and tired.

UNCLE DAR sprinted clear early, bore out on the turn, was straightened in the stretch and pulled clear while kept to a drive. GO EAST pursued the winner,
was carried out on the turn then proved no match for the winner in the stretch. THE GRAYT PUMPKIN chased wide, steadied slightly at the three eighths
and faded. WINNIN'ONWEEKENDS dropped back outside, made a brief bid on the turn then faded. PROFESSOR KOOL lacked speed and was never in
contention. RUNNIN JOKE flashed speed inside and stopped abruptly. A claim of foul by the second finisher against the winner for interference on the turn
was dismissed. A claim of foul by the third finisher against the second finisher for interference near the three eighths pole was also denied.
