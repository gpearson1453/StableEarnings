Footnotes
ASIAN RAIN vied inside of TWO BILLS on the backstretch, continued in a mild duel entering the turn, shook clear midway through the turn, kept in a drive in
the lane to hold safely. RESTLESS RAMBLER away cleanly, tracked duo along the inside on the backstretch, continued along the inside on the turn,
launched bid along the rail and proved second best. TROMADOR off half length slow, slow to gather and quickly dropped back, saved ground on the turn
and finished up willingly along the inside. TWO BILLS vied two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, unable to match strides on the turn
with eventual winner, and steadily faded in upper stretch.
