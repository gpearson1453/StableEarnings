leader two wide on the backstretch, continued two wide on the turn, proved no match for winner and managed to save second. POTENTE ALBA stalked
pace along the inside, continued to save ground on the turn, angled out exiting the turn and rallied well to just miss second. ARRIVEDERCI ROMA chased
leader along the inside, had to pause entering the turn, lost some ground, re-engaged midway thru the turn and lacked needed kick in the lane to improve.
SURPRISE FASHION off a length slow at the start, saved ground throughout and launched a mild bid in the lane. TIME IS GONE settled well off the pace
on the backstretch two wide, continued two wide on the turn and lacked response in lane. COJO stalked pace two wide on the turn, continued two wide on
the turn, shifted out into the four path midway on the turn and came up empty in the lane.
