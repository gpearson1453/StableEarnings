Footnotes
STATE OF GRACE raced mid pack early, rallied in the stretch, split horses, driving. SORORITY SISTER pressed four wide throughout, rallied at the quarter
pole, held grudgingly and just missed. COSTUME JEWELRY was allowed to settle early, rallied at the quarter pole, then went evenly late. BIRDIE'S
CHANTZ steadied at the start, was unhurried early, and improved late. SPICE ICE pressed early, rallied on the inside down the backside, then flattened out.
WAR MOON dueled on the lead until the far turn, then tired. LADY FORTUNE had early speed and was through after a half. YOU NAME IT was outrun.
