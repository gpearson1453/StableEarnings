away. DANJER away well, broke in a path, began to drift out, asked right handed to maintain a straight course, responded and kept on willingly to the wire
while being no match. APOLLITICAL PENCE broke in, bumped with POWERFUL FAVORITE, quick into stride while drifting out, and kept under a strong
drive throughout while being outfinished by top two, . BOMB CYCLONE away a half length slow, drifted in two paths early, asked right handed passing the
gap, and asked again passing the final sixteenth in a game effort. A POLLITICAL CANDY V off bit slow while breaking out and bumped PATTY'S SAINT,
kept under a strong hand drive throughout while not threatening the top four. CATTAIL COVE away cleanly, lugged out past 1/8, kept under a hand ride to
the wire while weakening. POWERFUL FAVORITE off slow, pushed into inside rival at the start, then bumped twice with inside rival, put under a hand ride
while making mild late progress, . PATTYS SAINT brushed on hind end at the start, still away well, corrected to straighten out, lugged out under left handed
urging and steadily faded last half of race. SWEET DASHA FIRE off slow, quickly lost path, and failed to threaten. JESSAPOLLITICALGIRL off bit slow,
bumped with POWERFUL FAVORITE twice early, uncomfortable in behind horses early, crossed over midway and altered in while never asked.
