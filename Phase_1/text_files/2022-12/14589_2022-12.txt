Footnotes
COMPASS CAY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the
quarter pole and dueled down the stretch to just get up for the win. CONFIDENT N ELITE dueled on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile,
continued to battle from the two path coming around the turn and dug in gamely in the lane, drifting out late and just missing. BAKER BLOCK chased the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and kept on in the lane. AIDINGANDABETTING dueled on the inside up
the backstretch and around the turn, continued to battle in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. AWKWARD PAUSE raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside early, saved ground around the bend and finished evenly while never threatening. EL ROMANTICO raced off the pace on the outside in
the opening stages, navigated the turn from the three path and was empty in the stretch. DUN RIGHT raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
EDMUND FITZGERALD led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the turn, and drew off in the lane. MY BIG
DRAMA stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn, could not go with the winner in the lane
and kept on to the wire. EL MIC TIESUN raced off the pace on the inside early, came around the bend in the three and four path, swung wide into the
stretch and improved position in the lane. MISTER FERNANDO tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn
and weakened in the lane. BRAVE HILARIO chased the leader on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and faded
in the final furlong. SENA THE DUCHESS raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path, lost the whip in upper
stretch and made no bid. IT'S ME AGAIN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening stages, saved ground around the bend and
flattened out in the stretch. MY BROTHER MIKE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path
and tired in the lane. TORTOLA CAT dwelt at the break, trailed well behind the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground and was never a factor.

quarter pole, kicked clear entering the stretch and held that margin to the wire. BARAHIN saved ground while dueling through the opening half mile, led the
way from the two path around the far turn, was caught in upper stretch and chased the winner home. SILENT SONATA raced in the two path early, settled
off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began to improve position from the three path coming around the far turn and continued to gain
ground late. BEACH HOLIDAY brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the
backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn and improved position mildly in the lane.
SOCIALLONGDISTANCE brushed lightly with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to duel from the three path around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dropped back to chase the leader from the two path around the far bend and faded in the stretch. WAR CROSS saved ground around the first
turn, raced in the middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and
was empty from there. JUST DEAL WITH IT was shuffled back leaving the gate, raced in the four path through the opening quarter of a mile, trailed the field
up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was never a factor.

around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the far turn, kicked clear entering
the stretch and was caught in the final strides. DAKOTA DANCER led the way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled from
the three path coming around the second bend and gave way in the lane. KATIES A LADY raced in the three path on the outside through the opening half
