Footnotes
LITTLE ROCKY was four wide into the first turn then hustled along to track the leaders from three to four wide on the backstretch, was four wide on the
second turn and closed willing to prevail. AWESOME CAJUN was bumped by MY STORY in the first turn then settled near the back down the backstretch
and around the final turn, slipped through at the eighth pole to prove second best. BRITE OUTLOOK went to a pressured lead from between rivals, dueled
around the second turn and gave way grudgingly. UXMAL was off the pace on the inside around the first turn then dueled from inside around the second
turn, took a brief lead in upper stretch and weakened. PROPERLY CONNECTED was rushed up to contention from three wide around the first turn, dueled
for the lead around the second turn and tired. STEP ON IT was unsettled in the gate before the start, was unhurried around the first turn made a mild bid
into the backstretch but was never a threat. MY STORY floated out on the first turn and bumped AWESOME CAJUN and was always back.

around the first turn, went six wide into the second turn to make a rally, drifted in and bumped with BULLETSREVENGE in mid stretch fought gamely to the
wire and proved second best. BORK raced near the back to the final turn then made a move to go four wide in upper stretch to make a late rally. POLICY
LIMIT vied for the lead to the final turn from the two path and weakened. CONFESS stalked the pace from the three path, moved between horses on the
final turn and faltered. PLUTONIUM saved ground and not a factor. WAR REPORTER raced in the middle of the pack from the two path and was not a
threat. WIN IN THE CITY was always back. LUCKY BIG DADDY vied for the lead from the three path around the first turn and dropped back. A JOCKEY

Footnotes
DOUBLE STAR stalked the pace from the three path engaged the leader at the five sixteenth pole, drifted in at the quarter pole, moved out to four wide in
upper stretch to be up in the final strides. LANGS DAY raced in the middle of the pack from the three path, made a three to four wide bid on the second turn
to take the lead at the quarter pole and fought gamely to the wire to be second best. JIMI'S A STAR was forwardly placed through the first turn and down
the backstretch, checked slightly at the quarter pole, made a rebid at the three sixteenths pole to be up for the show. SARCASTIC TONE went to the clear
early lead then was headed at the five sixteenth pole and weakened. NATE'S ATTACK raced in the middle of the pack from the two path but was not a
factor. MAGEEZ was void of speed but was not a threat. CATHOLIC GUILT was off the pace early while saving ground around the first turn, settled in the
middle of the pack and gave way.
