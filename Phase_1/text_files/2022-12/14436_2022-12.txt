Footnotes
E BAR SCOUT dueled from the outside of foes while racing three to four wide and finished strongly in the drive to edge clear under strong handling.
MARKED BY A STORM tracked the top pair early, dueled from the inside with top pair nearing the three eighths pole and finished gamely to the wire.
CHARITY WATER was off a step slow, moved up near the rail around the far turn through the stretch, raced two deep late and kept on the wire. I GET
STORMED settled off the early pace, raced near the inside past the quarter pole, shifted off the inside to race five deep and made a late gain to improve
position. ALWAYS PUNCTUAL dueled for the early lead, raced between nearing the three eighths pole through the far turn and weakened a bit in the drive.
SISTER MARK settled off the early pace, raced seven to eight deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. LEONA raced mid pack early on, was two
deep near the quarter pole, angled to race six to seven deep into the upper stretch and never threatened.

Footnotes
GOGO OXBOW stalked the early pace, moved up three wide around the far turn and finished well to edge clear under strong pressure. JERSEY JOE
pressed the early pace from the inside and finished willingly to the wire. MASK OFF stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn, was five deep
near the three sixteenths pole and flattened out in the final stages. DESCENT settled off the early going, raced along the inside through the stretch run and
raced evenly with no final bid. SUPER HUNK showed good early speed while racing two wide and gave way. PROBATE was slowly, angled out, rushed in
the early stages, raced five from the outside of foes near the three eighths pole and never was a serious threat.
