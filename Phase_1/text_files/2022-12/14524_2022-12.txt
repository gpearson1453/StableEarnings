Footnotes
PLANTERS PUNCH was last away in the small group, shifted in and across a rival's path while rushing clear after a furlong, showed the way in hand around
the turn as that foe attempted to apply outer pressure, readily shook free when roused in upper stretch, and safely held sway under driving pressure.
RAMMER JAMMER checked lightly as an outer rival shifted across his path while clearing, chased that foe from the three path around the bend, then kept
on well to pull clear of the rest. LIT A SHUCK chased in the two path while off of the pace, and failed to menace. T G'S NELSON raced at the rear in the four
path, and got outrun. THE RIDER OF RAMMER JAMMER CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF PLANTERS PUNCH FOR INTERFERENCE DOWN
THE BACKSTRETCH; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
J B GRAY tracked along the inside, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, grinded away in pursuit of the clear leader in the final furlong along with an
inner rival, completed a bid outside of the tiring leader nearing the wire, and narrowly prevailed. PROBLEM CHILD rated at the rear while saving ground,
gained in midstretch while shifting between horses leaving the furlong grounds, dove inside of the tiring clear leader at the sixteenth marker, sustained a rail
bid nearing the wire, but desperately missed while dead-heating for place. BLINDEDBYTHEGEES pressed two wide, bid for the lead in the four path in
upper stretch, drove clear while hanging on his left lead at the furlong grounds, but tired in the final sixteenth as a pair of rivals closed in on either side, and
was nailed at the wire while dead-heating for place. MOKINGS chased in the three path and between horses around the turn, floated to the six path entering
the lane, and failed to factor. BLACKTECA set the pace along the inside, but offered little resistance to BLINDEDBYTHEGEES challenge in upper stretch,
and weakened. HOOSIER raced off of the pace in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and was outrun.

Footnotes
WHERE'S THE PUMPS tracked two wide and among foes down the backstretch, tipped to the four path and outside of the leaders approaching the three
furlong pole, gained place entering the lane as the leader kicked clear, yet ran on determinedly, took aim on that tiring one in the final furlong, and drove
past her a sixteenth from home. VISIONISTA laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted five wide turning for home, and stayed on to reach place at the
wire. COUNTRY LADY set the pace in the two path, kicked clear turning for home, but hung on her left lead through the lane, tired in the final furlong, was
worn down at the sixteenth marker, and got caught at the wire for place. STRAWBERRY SUNDAE broke sharp and just a bit outwardly, stalked four wide
and outside of rivals, pressed the leader from the three path around the turn, but gave way turning for home, and yielded between horses approaching
midstretch. MADISON'S SCREEN laid off of the pace along the inside, moved between horses turning for home, but failed to factor. PSEUDOSCIENCE
lagged behind in to the turn, then improved in the final furlong while showing late interest. BITSY PERFECTMATCH chased along the inside, saved ground
around the turn, but faded. CONTINENTAL RED tracked three wide while among foes for the opening quarter mile, but faltered entering the turn, weakened
in the five path turning for home, and was eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
SCHMOOZIN tracked along the inside, tipped outside of the top pair while claiming show leaving the quarter pole, ranged up to bid approaching the furlong
grounds, struck the front at that juncture, and inched clear. COURTHOUSE COVE vied two wide and between horses around the turn, forged an advantage
entering the lane, but failed to kick away while hanging on his left lead, got headed by an outer bidder at the furlong grounds, yet fought on thereafter.
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW tracked in the three path, shifted to the five path turning for home, and stayed on willingly. HYPERBOLIST set the pace inside of a
pair of outer vying rivals around the turn, got headed by his most immediate counterpart entering the lane, and gave way in midstretch. MULTI PLATINUM
pressed three wide, vied in the four path around the turn, but faded entering the lane.

HAROLD'S CLOUD set the pace, drew clear at the half mile pole, and widened under driving pressure through midstretch. COAL BOSS tracked two wide
and between horses, tipped four wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, then stayed on to claim place at the furlong grounds, while hanging on his left
lead, and ran on to prove second best. GHOST BIKE broke inwardly, tracked along the inside, claimed place from an outer rival entering the lane, but was
outkicked for that position in midstretch. HUMOR ME PLEASE lacked speed in the four path, and moved up in the final furlong while hanging on his left
lead. LET'S GO RANDOM pressed two wide, chased the clearing leader into the far turn, but yielded between horses coming to midstretch. WOLF
HUNTER broke outwardly, tracked three wide, but faded entering the far turn. TIZZY TANTRUM shied from an outer rival and bumped the inner part of the
starting gate at the start, trailed along the inside, and showed little.

Footnotes
BOOTSIE'S GALAXY stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leader to bid in hand at the five sixteenths pole, led entering the lane, and
drew clear in upper stretch. FLASHY BREW tracked three wide, chased the leading pair from the four path turning for home, hung on his left lead while
gaining place at the furlong grounds in pursuit of the clearing leader, then changed over at the sixteenth pole, and safely fended off an outer rival for that
position. COHERE laid off of the pace in the three path, ranged up outside of the leading trio and in the five path turning for home, but leveled off in the lane,
and ran on to claim show while chasing place home. CHEROKEE TAKEOVER trailed along the inside, then stayed on while off of the rail through the lane to
reach fourth at the wire. BIG BELLA BROWN set the pace along the inside, but was headed leaving the five sixteenths pole, and gave way on her left lead.
SABER RUN laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted a bit out in upper stretch, but lacked a rally. CRUSADER EXPRESS pressed two wide early on, but
weakened between horses around the turn.

Footnotes
BRU NA BOINNE bobbled while breaking towards the front, stalked three wide, pressed the top pair around the turn, briefly failed to keep pace in the five
path entering the lane, sustained stride to bid in upper stretch, gained an advantage coming to the furlong grounds, and held from bidding foes on either
side through the late stages. SOUPER EXPLOSIVE tracked in the three path, inched between horses turning for home, shifted out to the six path for racing
room while still between rivals at the furlong grounds, rallied to take aim on the leader soon after, but was kept at bay through the late stages. ROXY'S BALL
stalked along the inside, pursued while pocketed around the turn, searched for racing room off of the rail in upper stretch, split rivals two wide at the three
sixteenths pole to attempt a bid inside of the new leader leaving the furlong grounds, but leveled off late. AMISFIELD raced in midpack in the four path and
between horses around the turn, floated to the six path entering the lane, but was outkicked by an inner rival while being herded to the seven path at the
furlong grounds, and ran on. WAR SAVER broke a step slowly before being severely hampered and forced in multiple paths by an outer rival at the start,
raced far back two wide, and failed to menace. JOHANNY pressed two wide, vied between horses around the turn, led briefly in the three path in upper
stretch, but was headed by the eventual winner nearing the furlong pole, and yielded between horses leaving that juncture. LAST OF THE NILE broke in
and bothered a rival at the start, then saved ground towards the rear, but to no avail. FANCY CABER NEIGH se the pace, vied with a pair of outer rivals
around he turn, but was headed a the quarter pole, and weakened in midstretch. MO LOVIN laid off of the pace in the four path, and faded in the five path
turning for home.

Footnotes
LAKE RUNNER vied four to three wide around whil forging an advantage around the first turn, drew clear down the backstretch, opened up into the far turn,
met KAITLYN'S COURT's menacing bid in upper stretch, yet outdueled that rival while clinging to an advantage through the final furlong. KAITLYN'S
COURT raced at the rear while remaining in the five path around the first turn, strolled past rivals entering the far turn to take aim on the clear leader from
the four path turning for home, bid in upper stretch, dueled through midstretch while hanging on her left lead, and hung while subtly drifting out late.
CRAFTY PRINCESS saved ground far back, improved while tipping two wide entering the lane, claimed show at the three sixteenths pole, and was best of
the rest. I DONT KNOW EITHER settled off of the pace two wide, retreated to trail the field into the far turn, yet picked up stride shifting to the four path
turning for home, then chased evenly through the lane. IRON BANNER prompted the pace two wide and between horses, but faded among foes around the
far turn. EYESEEMONEY laid off of the pace along the inside, failed to gain four wide around the far turn before being floated to the eight path entering the
lane, and made little impact. STAR'S DREAM stalked three wide, but was outmoved by an outer foe at the five sixteenths pole, and weakened between
horses. ALLSTAR MAGIC prompted the pace along the inside, but weakened entering the far turn.
