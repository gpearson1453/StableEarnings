Footnotes
GLOWSITY showed good early foot to set the pace from the outside of foe and held safe in the drive to remain clear late under steady handling. CASHING
BIG CHECKS pressed the early leader from the inside, angled out to race from the outside through the upper stretch to race off the inside and finished
willingly to the wire. CLICK TO CONFIRM stalked the early pace, moved up two wide between rivals near the quarter pole, shifted out through the stretch
run and kept on to the wire. GAMESTONKS was allowed to settle early on, raced along the inside around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to
improve position. UNADULTERATED was void of speed, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. GRACE'S SECRET stalked the
early pace while racing three wide from the outside of foes and faded in the drive. MISS CHAMITA raced off the early pace, was four to five deep around the
far turn and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
CLUBMAN settled off the early pace, made an advance towards the leaders into the far turn, made a four wide bid near the five sixteenths pole while racing
outside of foes and held well in the stretch to prove best under strong handling. NORTHERN THUNDER stalked the early pace, moved up three wide near
the quarter pole and finished willingly to the wire. PARADISE PRIDE pressed early on from the inside of foe, dropped back near the far turn, came on again
through the stretch and gained the show position while racing four wide. ALBERTANO dropped back early to race off the early pace, raced from the outside
around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. MY MAN POTS N PANS race mid pack early on, made a two wide bid between near the
quarter pole and was empty in the drive. MONYINTHEBANKSEY showed good early foot from the outside of foe down the backstretch and faded the final
quarter of a mile. SASSY KING was void of early speed, saved ground and never threatened.

Footnotes
BLOWTHRUYELOWLITES settled off the early pace, moved up from the inside around the far turn, made a rail bid in the stretch run and finished strongly to
get up under steady pressure. BOSSERATI showed good early speed to set the early pace, was well clear near the eighth pole and was wore down late
while narrowly holding the place position. ANGELOFCANTERBURY raced mid pack early on, moved up from the inside near the quarter pole, shifted four
wide and finished gamely to the wire. GENIEINABRIDLE was slow early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole, angled to race six wide from the outside
of foes and moved up to improve position. VEGAS WILD CAT stalked the pace, raced three wide between rivals near the five sixteenths pole and raced
evenly with no closing run. LARAMORE dropped back to race mid pack early on, raced five wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. SICILIAN
GRANDMA was off a step slow, chased the early leader from the inside and weakened. WAR'S END KISS raced four wide past the three eighths pole, was
six deep near the three sixteenths pole, angled in and never threatened.

ALWAYSINAHURRY rated along early, checked while racing between rivals near the three eighths pole, circled rivals six wide through the far turn into the
upper stretch and got up late under strong handling. GOING TO THE LEAD showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside and finished gamely to
the wire. YODEL E. A. WHO settled off the early going, raced in tight quarters, shuffled back near the half mile pole, moved up five wide from the outside
near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. AIR TOKEN stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn into the stretch, angled
out just past the eighth pole and kept on to the wire. DOLLARIZATION tracked the top pair early on, was bumped, altered out through into the upper stretch,
raced four wide and raced evenly with no closing run. FAST BOB was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, was bumped, in tight through the upper
stretch and weakened while racing three to two wide.

AWARD WANTED was rated along early, raced two deep past the quarter pole, shifted out to race four wide and finished well to get up under strong
pressure. PRODIGY DOLL raced off the early going, moved up from the outside of rivals in the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. PAISLEY
SINGING showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside of Whiskey and Rye, dug in and gave way grudgingly late. HOLLYWOOD WALK
stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around the far turn, continued an inside bid in the stretch and had no final winning bid. WHISKEY AND RYE
pressed the early leader from the outside and faded. BLINKERS was slow early to trail, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally.

Footnotes
BOONDOGGLE showed good early foot to set the early pace and held well in the drive to be clear under steady handling. MOJAC KAT stalked the pace,
hard ridden near the three eighths pole from the inside, raced three wide in the lane and finished second best. JIMMY THE KID broke awkwardly, rushed
from the outside to contention and kept on willingly to the wire. INSTIGATED chased the pace from the inside and weakened. SAN ANTONE settled to race
mid pack early on, raced from the inside past the quarter pole, angled five wide and raced evenly with no closing run. WHIRLIN CURLIN raced along the
inside around the far turn, angled through the stretch run and never menaced. LIFESPAN dropped back early, raced six deep into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. WALL was pulled up after being injured and had to be euthanized.
