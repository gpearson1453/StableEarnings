Footnotes
KOOLHAUS unhurried to turn, wide run onto stretch to lead, held sway under stout handling to the wire. FLAGS UP no speed to turn, rallied in the lane,
coming on too late at wire. UNPREDICTABLE BAY went up to lead, could not go on and settled for show spot. STONEVICIOUS tracked outside to turn,
could not go on and leveled off late. WILLTORUN chased from inside to the stretch, weakened in the lane. PRIME FACTOR raced evenly while inside
through the late going. MUTAKATIF (IRE) never menaced throughout. AMICABLE lunged at the start, never a factor thereafter. TEQUILAS RANGER never
a menace throughout. JUST SAY WHEN anxious in the gate pre start, pressed pace to the turn, gave way. UNION GEN. GEORGE never a threat
throughout. ROGER MCQUEEN through early outside dropped back readily.

drive. RHYTHM FOREVER unhurried early, no speed to stretch, improved position late. SMOOTH LIKE ICE inside position to the stretch, flattened out in
the drive. TAMARA'S WAY awkward start, never recovered with little improvement. CATCHA LATER MO flashed speed between horses, gave way readily.
