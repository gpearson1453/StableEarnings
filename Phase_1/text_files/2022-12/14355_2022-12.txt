NEVER COMPROMISE quickly took over and rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole, drew clear past the five
sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail and held well under steady stretch handling. SAN ANTONE stalked two deep, challenged approaching the
seven sixteenths pole but dropped back toward the five sixteenths, rounded the far turn near the rail and settled for second best. FRANKEE MERCH stalked
from the three path the first turn, bid approaching the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and dueled through the stretch for third. SILENT
SERVICE settled off the rail on the first turn, bid past the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn in the four path and was outfinished in the stretch
duel for third. MY SACRED PLACE showed little response. THE IRON BANK settled in the three path the first turn and never factored. JACK THE RIPPER
(FR) stalked three wide on the opening turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, but faded into the far turn.

SENECA ROCKS rounded the opening turn in the four path, started her bid approaching the three eighths pole, dueled to the front past the quarter,
contested the edge through the far turn and held on under steady handling. CHANGE THE WORLD raced with the early pace inside then stalked into the
first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail, dug in to take second the final yards and was gaining slowly on the
winner. LUCYLOU WHO became a bit fractious in the gate then stalked from the three path, took a slim lead approaching the three eighths pole, was met at
the rail leaving the quarter, raced close through the far turn then flattened inside the sixteenth pole. DECISIVE CAUSE rounded the opening turn in the five
path and could only improve her position. LAVENDAR LANE took a slim lead nearing the three quarter pole and showed the way early on, was met toward
the three eighths and faded past the pole. BOUNDTOBEOK settled off the rail the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and gave chase toward the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then weakened.

the eighth pole and was steadily handled in the lane. LOGSTRADAMUS rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, picked up the chase leaving the
three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and dug in through the stretch to take second later yards. ICING veered out leaving the gate then tapered
in and took over toward the three quarter pole, drew clear approaching the seven sixteenths, was met at the rail nearing mid turn, dropped back past the
three sixteenths and flattened the final sixteenth. GET OFF MY CLOUD saved ground on the first turn, picked up the chase leaving the three eighths pole,
raced near the rail on the far turn, eased outward in the upper stretch and flattened stride. AIR MEDAL was never a factor. HILLBILLY ROCK settled off the
rail on the first turn and showed little response through the backstretch. ROCKET J. raced with the early pace inside then stalked into the first turn, but
dropped back toward the seven sixteenths pole and faded past the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
TREASURE TROVE saved ground off the pace, bid nearing the three eighths pole and took over two deep toward the quarter, edged clear approaching the
head of the lane and was steadily handled to hold on well. RRACE DAY WARRIOR settled in the two and three paths, gave chase toward the three eighths
pole, improved in the four path of the far turn then dueled for second approaching mid-stretch. HOBE SOUND settled off the rail, picked up the chase toward
the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and came along for second late. BUBBA GRUMP rated the pace inside, came under pressure
nearing the three eighths pole, was met approaching the quarter pole, contested at a close disadvantage through the far turn but dropped back toward the
eighth pole and flattened stride. GOODLUCKCHUCK stalked the early pace about the three path then faded through the backstretch.

Footnotes
THE LAST SCIP stalked from the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and dueled to even terms three wide midway on the far turn, dug in for the
lead in late yards and drew clear approaching the wire. EXAGGERATEDDEFENCE stalked two deep, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and took
the nod approaching the quarter, contested the edge through the far turn but was met while flattening stride late yards. POINT OF AN AFFAIR rated a short
lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at mostly even terms from that point, gave up the nod toward the quarter
pole then faded at the rail nearing the head of the lane. SHAKIN IT BIG TIME raced well back inside on the first turn, gave chase nearing the seven
sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn at the rail and showed little in the lane. AWESOME CHARGE settled off the pace inside on the first turn, picked up the
chase toward the seven sixteenths pole but flattened off the rail on the far turn. SPARKLING SHIRE rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up the
chase leaving the half mile pole but showed little response. MARCHED raced off the rail and showed little response after a half mile. DIVINAS
CONNECTION settled in the three path the first turn, eased outward into the backstretch but showed little more. NEVER FOR SPEIGHT rounded the first
turn in the five path, left the turn outside and was not a factor.
