Footnotes
DUDE N COLORADO (GB) was sent to set the pace from the three path, was cued to open up from said position turning into the stretch, responded well
and was driven clear. GREAT SKILL raced in midpack from the three path, moved up to the inside of rivals around the far turn, tipped out to the four path
into the stretch, and ran on to secure place. FORT WILDERNESS raced from off the pace in the six path, was ridden from the seven path into the stretch,
and kept on to get show honors. MOON CAT bumped with an outer foe at the start, was held up in the four path, tucked in to the the two path going into the
stretch, but finished evenly. EL ORO (FR) was steadied from the four path into the first turn, tracked from said position down the backstretch, was driven
from the six path into the stretch, but was outrun in the final furlong. FIGHTERTOWN raced in midfield from the six path, was coaxed from the seven path
entering the lane, but was tired. SUMMONYOURCOURAGE bumped with an inner foe at the start, was wellback down the backstretch, swung out to the
nine path entering the lane, but was no factor. PEREGRINO G stalked the pace in the two path but dropped back around the far turn. ENCENDIDO was
rank in the three path around the first turn, prompted the pace from the five path down the backstretch, was hustled from the four path into the stretch, but
faded. O GANGSTER was held up along the inside, floated out to the five path into the stretch, but was no threat. MAX SWAGGER was wellback in the
three path and never menaced. MR. PACIFIST was always behind around the four path.

Footnotes
ZYDECEAUX broke outwardly, set the pace in the three path down the backstretch, drew clear and angled to the rail nearing the far turn, set the pace along
the rail around the bend, continued on the left lead in the lane, drew off under a drive then was geared down late. BIG JOHN broke outwardly and bumped
at the start, chased the winner two wide between foes and stayed on to hold the place. LIGHTNING TONES stalked the pace three wide, lacked the needed
stretch rally and held for the show. OPEN CARRY was shut off at the start, raced off the pace in the three path, shifted further out in upper stretch and
improved position. GOLDEN TALENT was bumped at the start, chased the pace four wide and faded in the lane. O'CONNER SUNSET had speed inside of
the winner, chased from the rail around the turn and tired in the lane. EL DE LEO was pinched back at the break and trailed while racing well off the rail.

Footnotes
MATEO broke out and bothered an outer foe at the start, stalked from the five path, moved up to bid from the four around the far turn, took the lead from the
five path going into the stretch, and drew clear. HEART BOY was held up from the two path early, moved up around the far turn, and kept on to secure
place honors. ROYAL FOX HILLS bumped with an outer rival then an inner rival shortly thereafter, raced in midpack from the six path, was ridden into the
lane, and finished evenly for show. BUDDHA BOY was bumped by an inner rival at the start, raced prominently under a snug hold from the five path, took
the lead from the three path into the far turn, but flattened in upper stretch. MAJOR DEAL was squeezed at the start and forced to steady early, trailed from
the three path, was roused from the five path into the stretch, but never factored. DREAM OF BLESSINGS led from the two path but gaveway around the far

LONGLIVE THE QUEEN got bumped by an inner rival at the start, rated along the inside, was coaxed while shifting out to the six path going into the stretch,
and swept past a trio of inner rivals in the final furlong to win. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL broke out and bumped an outer foe at the start, trailed in the two path,
swung out to the eight path going into the stretch, and rallied down the center to get up for place honors late. LOOKIN AT MAGGIE prompted the pace in
the four path, was cued between rivals around the turn, but finished evenly from the two path in the stretch to show. EILAT tracked in the five path, loomed
up three wide around the turn, but was outrun from the four path in the final furlong. THREE GIRLS led from the two path, was cued from the rail around the
turn, but gaveway in the final furlong.

rallied inside for the place. HASHTAG NO WONDER hit the starting gate, saved ground well back, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes.
STREET VENDOR broke inwardly and bumped RAISING MOON at the start, raced off the pace three wide and had a mild rally. SWEEPING GIANT set the
pace two wide around the first turn, dueled inside of the winner down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn, angled three wide near the quarter
pole and faded in the final furlong. STAT failed to menace while racing two and three wide. RAISING MOON was bumped and pinched back at the start,
raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened. THE PENINSULA played no factor while racing four and five wide. WICKED GENIUS chased
the pace four wide and faded in the lane. JUST CALL RAY tossed his head at the start, saved ground and made little impact. CATATUMBO was outrun
while racing four and five wide. INVISIBLE WAR stalked the pace three wide and retreated through the lane.

up entering the stretch, and was much the best. BROWN EYED BEAUTY tracked from the five path, moved up from said position to bid passing the quarter
pole, and chased the winner home to secure place honors. STORM rated from the three path but was one paced from the six path in the stretch to get show
honors. ANATOMY trailed from the six path into the turn, swung out to the eight path going into the lane, and was outrun. ERIN'S MOMENT raced
prominently in the four path but faded turning into the stretch. CAJUN FANTASY set the pace in the two path but yielded turning into the lane. SASSY BUT

GOLDEN SODA set the pace in the four path, was roused from the three path turning into the lane, drifted out slightly passing the sixteenth pole, and held
on gamely. BANKER'S HOURS rated in the two path, was coaxed while tipping out to the six path turning into the stretch, and drifted in through the final
furlong while running on for place. DOCTOR RON got bumped between rivals early, tracked in the three path, was roused from said position turning into the
stretch, and kept on but got squeezed and forced to steady inside the final sixteenth to finish with show honors. ON JET HEIR pressed to the inside of the
eventual winner from the two path but yielded from said position passing the eighth pole. HARRY'S ONTHEBEACH chased from the six path and mildly
gained ground in the stretch. OUR NOBLE ORTEGA raced from off the pace in the four path but was never a factor. MAJOR KING hopped at the start,
trailed along the inside and never threatened. MOGALU stalked along the inside, bumped an outer rival around the five eighths pole, and never menaced.
HINDENBURG raced prominently from the five path but backed up around the turn. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF DOCTOR RON
AGAINST THE TOP TWO FINISHERS FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH WAS DISALLOWED
