Footnotes
BOAT SONG was quick to begin to set the early pace while racing in hand and held gamely in the drive to be clear under steady pressure. RUNAWAY
JACK was off slowly, stalked the pace, raced along the inside nearing the five sixteenths pole, angled four through the upper stretch and finished second
best. TEA WITH LEMON broke in, checked at the start, race near the back of the pack early on, moved up along the inside in the drive and improved
position. INSIDE THE CIRCLE stalked the pace, raced along the inside near the five sixteenths pole, shifted five wide and raced evenly with no closing run.
READY MADE chased the early pace while racing three wide and weakened. MINING CAMP was bumped, in tight at the start, raced off the early going,
swung seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. ANCIENT MAN raced mid pack early on, was outside of foes to race well off the inside in the
stretch run and lacked a bid. MAGAWISH was off slowly, raced far back and was eased up on in the stretch, Magawish walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
MORANT rated along to race mid pack early on, moved up six wide into the upper stretch, shifted in through the stretch run and finished strongly to get up
under strong pressure. JEMEZ FALLS dropped back early on, moved up three wide between rivals near the quarter pole, angled out and got up for the
place position late. BON DEUX raced mid pack early on, race from the outside in the lane and moved up to improve position. LOOKING SALTY was hard
sent from the outside to set the early pace, ridden along into the far turn and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CHIEF MYSTIQUE was unruly in the post
parade, pressed the early pace while racing two deep between rivals and kept on to the wire. WICKED SUPRISE stumbled at the break, quickly recovered
to stalk the pace from the outside, raced four to five wide around the far turn and raced evenly to the wire. ELECTRIC CHARGE was off slowly, raced near
the back of the pack early on, was three to four wide in the stretch run and made a mild late gain. UNCLE DICK angled widest into the upper stretch to race
from the outside and had no late rally. PERFUMER dropped back early on, raced near the inside around the far turn and had no late rally. TRYGVE failed to
respond. PUNISH KING chased the pace from the inside and faded. FIVE-EIGHTHS FRACTION ADDED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
CARTE BLANCHE was rated along under a firm hold while racing outside of foe, took command into the far turn, drifted mid stretch and prevailed under
strong handling. PISTOL BOX dropped to the back of the pack early on, moved up three to two wide through the stretch run and rallied for the place
position. CHRISTMAS PRESENT stalked the early pace, raced near the rail in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. IOYA AGAIN dropped back
early, made an advance towards the leaders around the far turn, raced four deep near the three sixteenths pole and moved up to improve position. TWO
COOKIE RULE raced mid pack in the early stages, raced from the outside in the lane and lacked a rally. PERFECT WAGER stalked the pace, took aim
while racing five into the upper stretch and flattened out. SCAT SHACK dropped back early down the backstretch, raced five wide around the far turn and
had no late rally. GAGOOTS dropped back early, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. RONNI'S STORM showed good
early foot from the inside and gave way.

willingly to the wire. W W CANDY dropped back early, raced four to five wide around the far turn and moved up to improve position. KHOZAN'S
VALENTINE was reluctant to load, raced mid pack early on, raced from the outside in the lane while racing seven deep near the three sixteenths pole and
made a mild late gain. TETSU raced with the second flight in the early stages, moved up three to four wide in the upper stretch and flattened out. STAR OF
KODIAK was off slowly, raced near the back early, swung wide into the upper stretch and had no final bid. STALLONE dropped back early, raced near the
inside past the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to race four deep and raced evenly with no closing run. MEDAL OF FACT chased the pace from the inside
and weakened. ROBO MAN raced mid pack early on, angled in, raced near the rail past the three eighths pole and had no response. LUCKY SHOT broke
awkwardly, raced at the back of the pack early, fanned wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. JACK VAN BERG stalked the pace, raced near the
inside around the far turn and faded.
