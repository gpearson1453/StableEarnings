Footnotes
MISTY TASTE saved ground around the first turn, moved out to the three path mid way down the backstretch, dropped back mid way on the far turn, swung
to the four path in upper stretch, led approaching the finish and held sway. WITTY BANTER , near the inner rail leaving the backstretch, eased out leaving
the far turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch and rallied outside the winner. R TENDERONI prompted the pace outside CHICA RABIOSA, gained the
lead leaving the far turn and weakened late. GOLD TIME VIXEN stalked the pace down the backstretch, advanced four deep on the far turn, had aim on the
lead to the eighth pole then weakened. CHICA RABIOSA made the early lead under urging, hugged the inner rail setting the pace and tired in upper stretch.
TIZ SUSAN ANN lost ground on both turns and drifted to the six path in upper stretch. CHALK HILL dropped back mid way down the backstretch, was
eased on the far turn and walked off.

Footnotes
RUSTYS GFIVEFIFTY sped up to the inside of rivals early to take command, set a rated pace while handling outside pressure from a pair of rivals,
remained under rating mid turn, responded and spurted clear soon into the lane, kept on under strong handling past furlong grounds, switched over to his
left lead late but continued with good energy through the wire. TRASH TALKIN LARRY prompted the pace three deep, was under asking while emerging as
the closest pursuer past the quarter pole, kept on well and was clear for the place. GHOSTLIGHTER pressed the pace between rivals, failed to keep pace
with the winner in upper stretch but kept on with effort to the wire. AMPERSAND dwelt at the break spotting the field multiple lengths, regrouped and edged
up five wide outside rivals heading to the turn, saw the leaders get away mid turn then lacked a serious late response. NEVER CHANGE , four wide outside
rivals while in range into the turn, failed to kick on under asking mid turn and gave way. DREAM BIG DREAMS stalked inside, was pushed along mid turn,
angled wide into the lane and weakened. There was a stewards' inquiry concerning the start of AMPERSAND. No action was deemed necessary.

Footnotes
NOAH CHANCE , two wide around the turn chasing BO'S BOURBON, overtook that one entering the stretch then eagerly drew away under mostly hand
encouragement. BO'S BOURBON drifted in leaving the starting gate, quickly sprinted clear hugged the inner rail around the turn and was no match for the
winner. THTWASTHENTHISISNW , bumped and squeezed leaving the starting gate, lacked speed, raced along the inner rail on the turn and through the
stretch and passed tired rivals. GRAND ESCAPE saved ground on the turn chasing the pace and weakened through the stretch. STEELE MONEY came in
at the break, failed to be a threat and swung to the five path in upper stretch. ISLAND D'LITE , three deep around the turn chasing the pace, weakened.
THE COLORA KID , taken to the four path in upper stretch, gave way between horses.

Footnotes
B WEST prompted the pace three to four wide outside the leader, allowed that one to go clear into the turn, responded to asking and came back on mid
turn, took command while floated out a bit into the lane, kicked clear past the three sixteenths and held firm under strong handling. CORONOVA rated five
wide stalking, dropped back some approaching the lane, shifted out and came back on with good energy through the final furlong to gain the place.
SHACKINTHEBOX , forwardly placed, dropped in towards the rail for the run around the turn, came under pressure mid turn, edged up along the rail to
challenge in upper stretch, failed to match strides with the winner past mid stretch, altered out but came up empty. IT'S VIPER drafted back off the early
pace and settled, angled out around the turn, circled six wide and closed steadily. JOHNNYFRENCHFRI sped up to take a slim early lead, set a pressured
pace off the inside, dropped in some and spurted away nearing the turn, was re engaged itno the lane, stayed willingly to mid stretch then faded. BLOWN
SAVE dropped far back early on, saved ground into the lane and had a mild late kick. COMPLETED STORM moved up between runners heading to the
turn, chased while close up mid turn, angled out and faded. QUINCY CAFE saved ground off the early pace, angled out under asking around the turn, came
three wide for the drive and weakened. SOUTHERN LAD , in mid pack early, raced three wide under pressure mid turn, swung seven wide into the lane,
faltered and was eased up on late.

FREE SQUARE , lightly bumped leaving the starting gate, sprinted to contention mid way down the backstretch, raced outside NOMO RON, steadily gained
in the drive and took the lead about forty yards from the finish. NOMO RON accelerated to the early lead, was taken to the inner rail approaching the turn,
remained along the rail setting the pace and weakened late. TOP BOSS saved ground on the turn, eased out to the three path entering the stretch and had
a mild rally outside the top pair. FORT FORTITUDE , taken to the four path turning for home, failed to menace in an even effort. SILENT SERVICE was not
a factor. EXCALIBUR drifted in leaving the starting gate and was outrun. RIDING CLOUD NINE was outrun. PERFECTLY MAJESTIC was outrun.
INDEFATIGABLE saved ground on the turn, remained along the rail through the stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
SEVIER broke well and got engaged in a pace battle to the inside of ARISTOCRATIC soon after the break, alternated for the lead around the turn, was
headed by a rival to his outside near mid stretch, battled back under strong handling to retake command heading to the sixteenth pole, briefly cleared then
dug in while drifting to prevail. ASKIN FOR A BASKIN didn't break all that sharp, rushed up in the opening three sixteenths to reach a forward spot, chased
outside a rival mid turn, swung out five wide for the drive and closed gamely to gain. FREE DANCER tracked the dueling leaders while three wide, shifted
out four wide for a clear run into the lane, ranged up to put a head in front in mid stretch, battled on past the sixteenth marker but was out finished. CHARGE
TO VICTORY saved ground chasing the embattled leaders, crept closer under coaxing past the five sixteenths, got through along the rail leaving mid stretch
and churned on. ARISTOCRATIC got into a pace scrum outside the winner soon after the start, gained a slim lead mid turn, fought on three wide and
between rivals from the three sixteenths past mid stretch then faded late. THE SICARII , off the pace, raced three deep mid turn, angled out for the drive
and lacked a bid. TOMMY THE TORCH , between runners mid turn, failed to make an impact. SEMPER FI , off the pace, angled very wide for the drive and
failed to rally. MACY'S BOY broke slowly, saved ground mid turn, eased out and faded. The race was hand timed.

Footnotes
ZABRACADABRA , confidently handled tracking two to three wide outside the leader, moved in hand to engage from the outside leaving the far turn, raced
in tandem while in hand past the three eighths, moved clear without much effort into the lane, responded when set down leaving the quarter pole and
steadily widened under solid asking. IYWAAN , three wide between rivals early, edged up mid turn, shifted in with pursuit past the furlong grounds and kept
on with good energy to be well clear of the rest. SOUTHERN DISTRICT broke a step slow, angled in and settled, gained some while saving ground nearing
mid stretch, angled out and kept on trying to the wire. VANCE SCHOLARS saved ground early, angled out under pressure mid turn, shifted five wide for the
drive but came up empty. LOCAL MOTIVE , four wide and outside a rival, chased to the five sixteenths and faded. MONDAY MORNING QB pulled his way
clear early, dropped in to set the pace, was joined by the winner leaving the far turn, battled inside that one to about the five sixteenths and weakened.
TORCH OF TRUTH , in the clear early on, failed to kick on around the turn, faltered and was eased late.
