Footnotes
WICKED MERCURY settled off the early pace while racing three wide, swung five wide turning for home, closed outside, switched back to the left lead near
the sixteenth pole and was up in deep stretch. DONTMESSWITHTESS was hard held while prompting the pace three wide, took the lead near the sixteenth
pole but was unable to stave off the winner late. PERSPICACIOUS was bumped at the start, sped to the front, set the pace along the rail, dueled inside of
foes to the sixteenth pole and held well to save the show. MONEY FACTOR saved ground well back, swung six wide in upper stretch and rallied belatedly.
CHICA BOOM broke outwardly and bumped at the start, raced four wide in midpack early, advanced four wide around the far turn then was one-paced
through the lane. PEARLESCENT pressed the pace two wide, dueled between foes around the far turn and through the much of the stretch then was in a bit
tight in the final few strides. SERENADE A KITTEN saved ground in range and lacked the needed rally. DIVINE EXCHANGE was very rank at the start,
remained rank while racing well back and two wide around the first turn, continued two wide around the far turn and never threatened. HARDLY SOCIAL
was shut off at the start, raced well back three wide and had a mild stretch gain. MOSLER'S IMAGE tracked the pace two wide between foes, tipped three
wide in upper stretch, lacked a clear path in the lane and was forced to check late. DOMINEERING was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two wide
around the first turn, went four wide around the far turn and lacked the needed rally. ZODIAC PRINCESS was bumped at the start, chased the pace three
wide and lacked a closing bid.

Footnotes
HONOR TORI broke in and bobbled leaving the gate, recovered well to stalk the pacesetter from the rail, was cued to bid two wide passing the three eighths
pole, took over and opened up from the five path into the stretch, and was much the best. YOOOU KNOW set the pace from inside, was coaxed when
headed by the eventual winner near the three eighths pole, was no match for the winner and began tiring in the final furlong but held on to place.
REASONABLY LOVELY trailed from the four path, was steadied going into the turn, moved up under rousing and swung out to the seven path entering the
lane, and finished evenly for show. UPSTREET chased in the three path, floated out to the five path going into the turn, and flattened in the stretch.
SISTREN rated in the three path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but never factored. QUEEN ROCKET bobbled at the start and tracked the
pace from the three path, but weakened entering the lane. DEFENDER GAL was prompted along from the two path but was empty turning into the stretch.

Footnotes
MOHAWK TRAIL set the pace along the rail, edged ahead in upper stretch, drifted out a bit under left-handed urging in the lane and held gamely.
LITERATE lacked early speed, saved ground, swung four wide in upper stretch, kicked in and just missed. WAND stalked the pace from the rail around the
first turn, angled three wide early on the backstretch, advanced three wide around the far turn, had aim outside of the winner in the lane but was outkicked.
CLOUDY BAY saved ground off the early pace, advanced inside down the backstretch, continued to gain at the rail around the far turn, bid inside of the
winner in midstretch then flattened out. SHE'S A JOY raced off the pace two wide and lacked the needed rally. SOUPER TROPICAL pressed the winner
two wide and weakened in the drive. STURDY GIRL was in range three wide but was through after a half.

Footnotes
CALIFORNIA GIGI raced in midpack from the four path, ranged up five wide around the far turn, took aim from the six path entering the stretch, and drew
past in the final sixteenth to get the win. SOUTH PACIFIC stalked from inside, was ridden along to take aim while four wide turning into the stretch, ran on to
take the lead entering the final furlong, but was caught in closing stages to place. HOTTER THAN JULY prompted the pace in the three path, was cued to
bid two wide going into the far turn, took the lead into the stretch, but faded in the final furlong to show. WHAT KNOT chased in the three path, was coaxed
from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly. SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) rated in the three path, was ridden four wide into the stretch, but was one
paced. MAMITA LINDA had a tardy start and trailed from the three path, was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but never factored. TWIN CAUSE
tracked in the four path, was roused to bid three wide around the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. ELUSIVE UNCAPTURED set the pace from the two
path but yielded from the rail turning into the stretch. DIA DE SOL raced off the pace from the five path, moved up under rousing four wide around the far
turn, had to steady and was bumped entering the stretch, and was empty.

Footnotes
MY CANDY GIRL settled off the early pace while racing two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, closed between foes in the lane, took over
leaving the sixteenth pole and held gamely between foes. FUENTE OVEJUNA (GB) trailed inside early, advanced inside around the far turn, was in tight
near the quarter pole, squeezed through a narrow opening turning for home, closed inside, reached near even terms inside of the winner leaving the
sixteenth pole and just missed. STUCK ON KITTEN raced off the pace three and four wide, surged through the final furlong and just missed. INSATIABLE
set the pace in the two path, drifted out in the stretch and weakened. FAWNING stalked the pace inside, tipped out in upper stretch and was one-paced
through the lane. I'M SO SORRY prompted the pace three wide and faded in the stretch. KANTA saved ground off the pace, steadied near the quarter pole
and lacked the needed rally. MINT EDITION failed to menace while racing three and four wide. BLUE TIMES tracked the pace four wide and came up
empty in the lane.

AWESOME APEAL pressed along the inside early, dropped back going into the turn, was roused and bid from the rail going into the lane, dueled with an
outer rival to the wire, and got the bob. LOOK UP TO HEAVEN stalked in the six path, took aim from the five path turning into the lane, and ran on but lost
the bob to finish with place honors. STARSHIP NUGGET prompted the pace in the five path, bid from the four path turning into the lane, and kept on but
was outrun between a pair of foes in the final furlong to finish with show honors. CAGED PIXIE had to steady early and raced from wellback in the four path,
but finished evenly in the stretch. MUDSHAFT set the pace in the four path, was coaxed from two wide into the stretch, but yielded at the top of the lane.
CHUTZPAH trailed along the inside early and was never a factor. CAPRIDREY rated in the five path but never threatened. DIGNIFIED tracked in the three
path but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
CARABINERO tracked in the three path, was ridden along while swinging out to the seven path turning into the stretch, rallied while drifting in through the
stretch, and drew past in the final sixteenth. GRAN SLASH bumped with an outer foe at the start, set the pace from inside, lost the lead around the turn,
rebroke and took the lead along the rail into the final furlong, and ran on but was caught at the sixteenth pole to place. ZYDECEAUX broke in and bumped
an inner rival, stalked from the two path, bid between rivals turning into the lane, but evened out at the eighth pole for show. BORIS broke in and bumped
with an inner foe, prompted the pace from the four path, made a bid around the turn, but was one paced in the stretch. HARD TO HANDLE trailed from
inside early and never threatened. ROLLING ON was bumped by an outer foe at the start, was hard held from inside going into the turn, was driven from the
three path into the stretch, but weakened. MIDNIGHT ONYX rated in the five path but was no menace.

TOERIS settled off the pace along the inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, closed outside and was up in the final strides. TEQUILERA set a
pressured pace along the rail, dueled around the far turn and through the stretch, was in tight quarters late and dug in gamely to win the duel while unable to
quite stave off the winner. REGAL REALM pressed the pace two wide, took the lead near eighth pole, led to late and hung. JUMEIRAH saved ground off the
pace, angled out in the stretch and had a mild gain. MARIA'S REVENGE failed to menace while racing two and three wide. WONKA raced off the pace

Footnotes
LOVIN MAKES CENTS raced in midpack from the five path, ranged up four wide around the turn, bid from the six path into the final furlong, took the lead
and held off an outer rival to win. SOLAIR was unhurried from the five path early, was roused from the seven path into the stretch, and chased home the
winner to place. FLIP MY ID pressed from the four path into the turn, bid three wide entering the lane, and kept on to hold show. CUPID AUSTIN raced from
wellback and inside early, was roused from the five path around the turn, swung out to the seven path for a clear stretch run, and was gaining late.
MIRACLE DRUG (IRE) hopped at the start and chased along the inside, but finished evenly in the stretch. BOSTON PRINCESS tracked between foes
early, was hustled along from the four path into the stretch, but was one paced. BALI MOON raced off the pace in the four path and passed tired rivals in the
stretch. PERFECT PROVISION set the pace in the two path but gaveway in the final furlong. GHOSTLY NIGHT rated from inside, was ridden from the four
path into the lane, but was no factor. CANDYMEISTER trailed from the three path into the stretch and was no threat. MUGURUZA chased from three wide
but was empty in the stretch. CROSSTALK was coaxed along from inside but was no menace.
