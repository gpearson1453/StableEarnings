Footnotes
DEMON HUNTER tracked along the inside, then two wide while among foes around the far turn, aimed to bid inside of the leading pair in midstretch, did so
entering the final furlong, and edged an advantage in the late stages. RONALDS GATSBY settled off of the pace two wide, gained in the four path around
the far turn to loom a danger outside of the new leader turning for home, produced a bid in upper stretch, vied along with an inner bidder through the final
furlong, but was outfinished. STONE ALLIANCE stalked three wide, crept closer to bid entering the far turn, inched clear with five sixteenths to go, but met
challenges from a rival on either side in midstretch, and yielded through the final sixteenth. THEOS FLEW leaned out and brushed a rival at the start,
pressed two wide and between horses around the first turn, moved forward to vie entering the backstretch, but was outkicked by an outer rival approaching
the five sixteenths pole, and faded turning for home. WILD FIST trailed around both turns and never got involved. FRIEND'S DO CARE took a mild brush
from an inner rival at the start, set the pace, vied with an outer rival down the backstretch, but weakened entering the far turn, and was eased through the
lane.

Footnotes
BITSY'S CUSTOM C set the pace two wide, cleared leaving the half mile pole, remained a path off of the rail while well in hand around the turn, repelled an
outer rival's meager bid in upper stretch, and drew off under wraps through the final furlong. THE THREE KS took bumps from rivals on both sides when put
to tight quarters soon after the start, rushed forward to lay close up inside of the leader early on, stalked that foe approaching the turn, tipped to the three
path to take aim on him entering the lane, but failed to progress while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch, was outpaced coming to midstretch, yet
managed place. STEAL IT BACK bumped an inner rival soon after the start, tracked in the two path, then chased through the lane while proving best of the
rest. ARGYBARGY BUCK chased in the two to three path while under consistent urging to keep pace, fanned out to the six path entering the lane, and
improved a position while lacking a bid. GEM OF CARLOS broke through the gate pre-race, but remained in the grasp of the assistant starter despite
tossing his rider, reloaded without further incident, then bumped with an outer rival at the start before checking soon after, lacked speed in the three path
around the turn, and tired. SNEAKY ALLIE KAT broke slowly and was outrun.

AVERI EVER AFTER stalked along the inside, smartly claimed place nearing the far turn before pressing outside of the pace setter while between horses
soon after, bid for the lead and sparked a duel at the five sixteenths pole, sparred while forging a narrow advantage in upper stretch, but was re-headed by
her inner counterpart at the furlong pole, yet kept on determinedly to regain the fore at the wire. CADILLAC RIDGE was hustled out of the gates, cleared
and tucked to the two path nearing the first turn, showed the way before meeting AVERI EVER AFTER's challenge at the five sixteenths pole, fought on
bravely after being headed in upper stretch, regained an advantage at the furlong grounds, but failed to seal the deal in the closing stages, gave in late, and
was nailed at the wire. UNIFIED LOVE bumped an outer rival at the start, saved ground while trailing, then stayed on inside of foes to gain show at the
sixteenth pole. ANITA'S VISION laid off of the pace in the five to four paths around the turns, and made little impact. MO BLING took bumps from rivals on
either side at the start, tracked three wide, pressed the top pair around the far turn, but yielded to them in upper stretch. KITTENOFTHE COURT pressed
the leader from the three path, but weakened between horses at the three furlong pole.

Footnotes
WHY BEHAVE prompted outside of the pace setter, vied in the three path around the turn, sparred through the lane as the prolonged duel drew on, and
edged away in the closing stages. SIKUM set the pace in the two path, vied with an outer rival around the turn, sustained the long battle through the lane,
but gave in late. SASSY EMMA laid close up along the inside, was coaxed along while chasing in the two path and behind the leading pair around the turn,
drifted a path too far when asked to tip outside of them entering the lane, drifted out again approaching midstretch while chasing, and ran on. PI YO
PRINCESS saved ground off of the pace, but to no avail. MADAM HENNY laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the seven path in upper
stretch, but lacked a bid. MEDWAY QUEEN tracked two wide, but was floated out by an inner rival entering the lane, and gave way. ABBEY LANE trailed in
the four to six path around the turn, and was outrun. THE HEAD-ON REPLAY IS UNAVAILABLE

Footnotes
FLINT RIDGE sped clear, widened his margin while well in hand around the turn, and cantered home under wraps with an insurmountable advantage.
ARABIAN PRINCE was last away, tracked along the inside, claimed place entering the lane, and was second best. MASTER GAME was bumped and
jostled between horses at the start, laid off of the pace in the three to four paths, ranged up to bid for place four wide turning for home, but was outkicked by
an inner rival for that position entering the lane, and ran on. FLAT OUT AMERICAN took a bump from an inner rival at the start, raced in midpack three
wide, vied for place between horses turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner rival entering the lane, and shifted inwardly while hanging on his left
lead nearing midstretch. MASQUERADE BALL trailed and never got involved. HOLY CITY chased two wide, got outkicked between horses entering the
lane, and weakened. EL DURANGO was herded by an inner rival into an outer foe at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, but was done early, and
eased through the final furlong.

Footnotes
PHILEAS FOGG set the pace along the inside, shook free entering the lane, and held sway through the final furlong. FIGHT'N READY stalked along the
inside, vied for place entering the lane, gained that position approaching midstretch, and held it from his outer wandering counterpart. SINGLE RULER
bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked outside of the pace setter, pressed nearing the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, sparred with an
inner rival for place leaving the quarter pole, relinquished that position while drifting out at the furlong grounds, flopped back to his left lead soon after
causing him to lug in approaching the final sixteenth, then continued to wander about while being fended off for place. BASELINE BEATER settled off of the
pace two wide, shifted out to the five path and quickly moved forward outside of foes entering the far turn, tracked from striking range outside of the top pair
around that bend, but failed to sustain progress turning for home, flattened out and yielded to the leaders in upper stretch, yet held fourth through the final
furlong. FORTUNE broke in at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, improved to a tracking position down the backstretch, awaited racing room two
wide around the far turn, found room three wide in upper stretch, but failed to change leads, and lacked a bid. SIR broke a beat slow, trailed in the two path
before saving ground around the far turn, yet made little impact. STEP ON IT was solidly bumped by rivals on either side while put to tight quarters at the
start, chased from midpack three wide, but failed to sustain position nearing the far turn, and was done early, and eased through the final furlong.
BERNUCCI bumped an inner rival at the start, pulled forward four wide around the first turn to a three wide stalking position entering the backstretch, but
weakened at the half mile pole, and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
LEAD ME trailed along the inside before tipping two wide down the backstretch, allowed an outer rival to move early entering the far turn, shifted to the five
path to track outside of the top flight shortly after, then rallied to bear down on the leader in the late stages, and narrowly prevailed. LAWLESS TIMES
stalked three wide, bid for the lead around the far turn as an outer rival forced her hand, vied between horses turning for home, sparred with his inner
counterpart through the lane, led in the final furlong, but was caught by an outer bidder at the wire. CLASSICAL MAGNOLIA pressed two wide, led narrowly
with five sixteenths to go as a pair of outer rivals menaced alongside, gamely sparred with her most immediate foe through midstretch, but yielded in the
final sixteenth. QUEEN OF THE MOON tracked along the inside, then two wide around the far turn, yet only managed to chase through the lane.
DREWSILLA settled off of the pace two wide, gained four wide into the far turn to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied turning for home, but weakened in
upper stretch. MRS. NECAISE set the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the far turn, and weakened inside of a trio of rivals at the five
sixteenths pole.
