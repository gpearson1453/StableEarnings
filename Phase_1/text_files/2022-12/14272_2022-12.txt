Footnotes
CLUB MESQUITE lacked early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards. IN
THE MIDST sprinted clear soon after the start, saved ground while setting the pace, angled out into the lane, re-bid and gave way grudgingly to the winner.
ETU BABOU lagged early, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy. POLITICAL RIOT settled off the leaders early,
moved up four-wide to take command nearing the half, opened a clear margin and gave way through the final furlong. CHROME KING was forwardly placed
from the inside and gave way in the drive. VICTORY AT LAST chased the leaders for five furlongs and weakened.

POVERTY BAY sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, remained in control through mid-stretch and held off the closing WESTPORT
CAPTAIN by a diminishing margin. WESTPORT CAPTAIN chased the winner while racing three-wide, responded when set down for the drive and was
gaining on that rival late. TEMPTED MISSION chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and finished with good energy. BET ON DAD was
forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. ROBIN'S EMPIRE lacked early foot, raced four-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. DODGER BLUE lagged throughout.

WAY TO FIRE broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing four-wide, opened a clear margin into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. A
WHOLE LOTTA HULA disputed the pace from the inside with the winner and yielded to that rival through the final sixteenth. DIPLOMATICA settled off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished evenly late. KEEPINMYPROMISE was void of early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with some late run. WORKIN NINETOFIVE was void of
early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. DELAWARE DESTINY raced off the leaders early throughout and gradually weakened.
KNOCKON showed no early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not threaten. DATQUICKCAT was away alertly to vie for the lead while racing
three-wide and weakened after going a half.

CAUSE AND EFFECT stalked the leaders while racing four-wide, responded when set down late and was up in the closing yards. AWHITESPORTSCOAT
dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not hold the winner safe late. MAD LUTHER lagged early,
raced five-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. SINGANDCRYINDUBAI was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide
through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. TEXAS LONG BOW settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through
the turn, angled out further with a sixteenth to run and finished evenly. FAMOUS ROCK STAR disputed the pace from the inside and gave way through the
final sixteenth. SIR DEPUTY raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. MANCUSO AT THE MIC was
void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not menace. GOT EVEN SMARTER lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did
not offer a bid.

Footnotes
RAIL HUGGER broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, responded when challenged by NORTHCUT nearing the half, vied with that rival
through a prolonged drive and gamely prevailed. NORTHCUT was away in good order to press the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, moved up to
engage that foe nearing the half, vied and just missed through a hard drive. MAJOR ATTRACTION was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the second turn, offered a bid into the lane, vied but could not get by the top pair. GIANT PAYDAY settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the second turn and finished with good late energy. PEACE OF EKATI was forwardly placed from the inside early, remained inside for the drive and
failed to gain late. FALSELY ACCUSED raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and weakened in the drive. HEIR (FR)
showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not offer a bid. ADDED QUARTER-MILE FRACTION FOLLOWING VIDEO
