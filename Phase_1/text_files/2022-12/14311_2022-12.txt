Footnotes
GOZILLA contested for the lead on the rail entering the turn, began to edge away from his speed rivals at the five sixteenths pole, continued to set the pace
at the top of the stretch and was kept to the task holding safe at the finish line. GALVASTON was part of the dueling leaders racing in between horses down
the backside, battled with runners on either side turning for home to be in the hunt for the top prize, chased the winner in vain through the stretch but could
not gain and settled for second best. GRAND ALLIANCE tracked the engaging three frontrunners down the backstretch, was ridden hard at the quarter
marker, angled out five wide at the top of the lane and closed well between rivals to capture third money. BLUE MAX settled near the rear outside in the four
path at the half, was urged for more run midpoint on the turn, angled six wide for the drive and showed some good late energy to be involved for the minors.
FOUR ACES HIGH tracked on the rail the contesting threesome up front down the backside, was roused inside three furlongs from the wire, put in a mild
run until the top of the stretch and stalled behind runners at the furlong marker. JILL broke out at the start, regrouped quickly to have the early lead,
contested three wide for the top spot on the turn, was in contention five wide outside foes turning for home and tired very late nearing the wire losing
positions. SOUPER RIVER trailed the field between rivals at the half, could not gain position racing on the turn, angled out seven wide for the stretch drive
and made little impact running to the wire.

Footnotes
CHROME'S ANGEL broke a step slowly, settled toward the back two to three wide, began to advance on the far turn fanning seven wide into the stretch,
drove past inside the final eighth. SILENT DIVA tucked in behind three to four wide heading into the first turn racing outside foes in the back half of the field,
advanced outside four then five then six wide on the far turn, struck the lead at the three-sixteenths, was overtaken past the eighth pole and outkicked while
second best. CAUGHT AN EDGE settled off the pace inside, saved ground, moved out a path to pass a rival near the quarter pole, mad a mild bid inside
foes at the top of stretch but evened out thereafter. ALCOM'SOUTINTHWASH was outpaced early, came out seven wide for the drive, improved late.
DANISH DYNAMITE raced about mid-pack two to three wide early, moved out from three to five wide on the far turn and in striking distance coming past the
quarter pole but flattened out. STRIKE THE POSE bobbled at the break, moved forward to set the tempo racing off the inside, was overtaken up the
backstretch, switched outside that rival, was still within striking distance three to four wide on the far turn, weakened and shifted out a bit in upper stretch.
BLUEBERRY DOLL tracked inside up close, lugged out a bit in upper stretch while continuing to drop back. MISS BIKINI moved forward four to five wide on
the first turn, stalked early up the backstretch before edging closer to take over about the nine-sixteenths, moved in a bit once clear into the far turn, was
overtaken and faltered.

LIGHT THE LAMP broke sharp the clear for the lead getting to the rail by the half mile marker, continued setting the pace opening up on his rivals
throughout the turn, was kept busy in mid stretch and won comfortably while unchallenged crossing the line. WOOD BE WILD tracked on the rail in the
beginning, was steadied briefly at the seven sixteenths marker, slipped up the fence midpoint on the turn, angled out to the three path for the drive and
could not close the gap on the winner while finishing a solid second. STYLISH GENT stalked in mid pack racing three wide, offered a mild rally four wide at
the quarter pole and ran evenly through the stretch to just hold for the show award. SOUPER RUSH was situated at the back on the rail down the backside,
could see them all at the top of the lane, was nudged on between foes at the eighth pole and closed late but had to settle for a small share in the end.
SILVER BULLET LADY settled just outside near the rear in the early stages, angled out to be four wide turning for home and could not get involved running
through the stretch. FORESTER HUMOR chased the loose speed winner on the turn, began to weaken between runners two furlongs from the prize and
faltered at the furlong marker.
