Footnotes
BET ON BOURBON dueled for the lead two wide, tucked while narrowly inching clear of his inner counterpart at the three furlong pole, met CHEYANN
GLITTERS' outer challenge nearing the lane, shook free in upper stretch, and twice resented the rider's use of the crop in the final furlong while holding
sway. CHEYANN GLITTERS chased along the inside, tipped three wide and between horses entering the turn, ranged up to bid outside of the leader
nearing the lane, but was turned away in upper stretch, kept on while hanging on his left lead, but was fended off. GUANAJUATO laid off of the pace in the
two to three path, came into the lane in the four path while gaining show, then followed the top pair home. MAGGIE'S RETURN broke out, laid off of the
pace in the three to five paths, and stayed on willingly. CHARLIE SKY vied along the inside of the eventual winner, but failed to keep pace at the three
furlong pole, got outkicked for place while failing to shift outside of the tucking pace setter, then caved in upper stretch before being eased through the final
furlong. MRS. DELLA was floated out by an inner foe at the start, tracked three to four wide, but weakened while floating wide entering the lane.

Footnotes
IZEONDEC trailed in the three to five path entering the backstretch, inched closer in hand to bid at the half mile pole, assumed command in the four path at
the three furlong marker, then quickly control, widened under moderate urging, and was kept to task from drifting out while padding his insurmountable
margin. CAT FIVE pressed then stalked outside of the pace setter, bid under a drive along with outer foes with a half mile remaining, failed to keep pace
with those wide rivals entering the far turn, faded between horses leaving the three furlong pole, yet shifted out a few paths while regaining stride, improved
to bid for place at the furlong grounds along with an outer rival, and gamely outdueled that foe to the wire. KEEP ON laid off of the pace along the inside,
shifted three wide while trailing into the far turn, moved up to bid for place in midstretch, sparred with an inner rival for that position through the final furlong,
but was denied. ILLUSIONED tracked three wide, bid for the lead between horses at the half mile pole, vied with his outer bidding counterpart entering the
far turn, but quickly proved no match at the three furlong pole, and weakened thereafter. NORWOOD set the pace in the two path, but weakened inside of a
trio of bidders nearing the far turn.

Footnotes
AGAMI set a clear pace in the three to two paths, got a breather entering the far turn, then responded well and drew off in upper stretch, and was driven
home to seal the deal. TAP IRON FIST tracked along the inside, crept closer to the clear leader entering the far turn, but only managed to chase him turning
for home, secured place from an outer rival leaving the furlong grounds, and was second best. MIDNIGHT FAITH leaned in and bumped a rival at the start,
raced at the rear along the inside, improved to midpack to chase under urging in the three path around the far turn, then lugged outwardly many paths in
midstretch, yet improved a position late. MO SMOKING broke a step slowly at the start while shifting a bit outwardly, tracked two wide, ranged up to be the
closest pursuer of the clear leader entering the far turn, chased him turning for home, but weakened in upper stretch. FITTS N STARTS was off a beat slow
before taking a bump from an outer rival at the start, trailed two wide, then in the four path around the far turn, and made little impact. JAZZ JAZZ JAZZ
hopped slightly while off a bit slow, stalked outside of the clear leader, but faded after a half mlle, and was done early.

Footnotes
ALL WEST trailed along the inside, gained four wide turning for home before floating five wide in upper stretch, sustained a grind through midstretch, bid
leaving the furlong grounds while shifting in marginally then edged clear through the final sixteenth. GORMLEYS GOT GAME pressed two wide, vied around
the turn, dueled through upper stretch, dug in between horses entering the final furlong, shifted out slightly approaching the final sixteenth, then was bested
by an outer rival soon after before managing place to the wire. THE QUEENS JULES set the pace inside of a pressing rival, vied with him around the turn,
dueled through midstretch, but yielded in the closing stages. FIRST GLIMPSE tracked three wide, floated four wide and between horses in upper stretch,
chased among foes through midstretch, but jostled with an inner rival when put to tight quarters nearing the sixteenth pole, steadied in the process, and
failed to recover. CRIME SPREE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leading pair in upper stretch in order to take aim along with a pair of outer
rivals, mildly grinded away while hanging on his left lead, but was bumped by an inner rival approaching the final sixteenth, jostled with an outer foe and
steadied in tight quarters in the process, and trailed home. FOLLOWING RIDER'S OBJECTION OF CRIME SPREE AGAINST GORMLEYS GOT GAME
AND FIRST GLIMPSE FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE FINAL FURLONG, AS WELL AS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE STRETCH RUN;
GORMLEYS GOT GAME WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED FIFTH.

Footnotes
VICTORY MARCH stalked three wide, bid four wide entering the lane, inched clear approaching the furlong grounds, and held off an outer rival late.
OVERANALYTICAL laid off of the pace along the inside under steady urging, swung five wide entering the lane, pursued the new leader from the outside in
midstretch, attempted a bid in the final furlong, but was kept at bay. KISLOVODSK tracked in the two path, moved forward between horses entering the
lane, and chased. FASTNFURIOUS sparred for the lead two wide, showed the way around the turn, shifted out while meeting VICTORY MARCH's
challenge entering the lane, but was headed approaching midstretch, and yielded between horses while shifting in slightly. FORCIBLE ENTRY lagged
behind around the turn, cut the gap in the four path approaching midstretch, but lacked a bid. ROCK WITH YOU sparred for the lead along the inside,
chased his outer counterpart around the turn, then yielded turning for home. NOBLE GABE was last away, laid off of the pace in the four to five paths, and
was outrun.

Footnotes
OURS AND THEIRS tracked four wide, chased while hanging on her left lead through the lane, gained in the final sixteenth to bid outside of the tiring
leader, and narrowly prevailed at the wire. WUPKAR stalked the top pair from the inside, shifted outside of them at the three furlong pole, ranged up to take
aim on the leader in upper stretch, drove past him at the three sixteenths pole, kicked clear at the furlong grounds, but tired late as an outer rival closed in,
and got nailed at the wrie. NONEYA laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted three wide and between horses in upper stretch, grinded away inside of the
eventual winner in the final furlong, but failed to have enough to sustain a bid along with that one late. VIOLA STAR broke slow before shying from an inner
rival at the start, trailed in the two to three paths, shifted out to the six path in upper stretch, and stayed on late to reach fourth at the wire. ROYAL
O'HAIGAIN pressed two wide, chased the leader turning for home, but was outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, and tired. SUMITUP set the pace,
inched clear entering the lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival at the three sixteenths pole while proving no match, and faltered in the final furlong.
WENDY WILECAT was brushed by rivals on either side shortly after the start, and never got involved.

Footnotes
LUCKENBACHER stalked in the three path, bid along with an inner IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT entering the lane, led from that one through midstretch, and
drove clear through the final sixteenth. IMINDYCATBIRDSEAT laid off of the pace two wide and between horses, gained around the far turn to bid at the
quarter pole along with an outer rival, sustained vying position through midstretch, but failed to keep pace a sixteenth from home. MY GUITAR broke a beat
slow, raced inside of foes in midpack before checking entering the backstretch, chased around the far turn before shifting out to the four path in upper
stretch, then stayed on between horses to bid for show leaving the furlong grounds, and reached that position soon after. I'M D'CAT tracked along the
inside, chased to gain show from outer rivals in midstretch, but was outkicked for that position at the sixteenth pole. LOUISIANA MOON was brushed by an
outer rival into an inner foe at the start, settled at the back along the inside, gained in upper stretch, shifted out in midstretch to be five wide entering the final
sixteenth, and sustained progress. UNWANTED INTRUDER tracked three wide and between horses, chased five wide and outside of those rivals around
the far turn, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, and gave way. ZENUCCI lacked speed four wide, came into the lane in the six path, and faltered
between horses in the final furlong. DONNA'S COURT ran off to a wide margin, but tired turning for home, and was swallowed up entering the lane. GREY
SLOAN never got involved. THREE RUN HOMER brushed an inner rival at the start, then was kept wide and away from rivals while lacking speed, and
showed litlte.
