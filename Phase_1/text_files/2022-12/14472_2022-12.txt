Footnotes
ARE YOU HAPPY closed to the front at the three quarter pole, angled to the inside and rated the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn at the rail and was steadily handled in the lane. STAVANGER raced well off the early pace in the five and six paths on the opening turn,
picked up the chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, got up for second mid-stretch and finished evenly. GANDHI'S
ORION settled inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole, raced at the rail on the far turn and gave up second mid-stretch. BROTHER MERLE rounded the
first turn in the five path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the five path of the far turn and showed little in the lane. DR WILL
rounded the first turn in the two and three paths, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and weakened.
BOUBOLINO raced well back and could only improve his position. PLAYING GOLD was not a factor. TURTLENECK TED stalked the early pace, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole but weakened at the rail on the far turn. MY SON CHRIS raced off the pace in the three path the first turn then faded
through the backstretch. COOL DUDE was pinched back and clipped the heels of Turtleneck Ted past the three quarter pole and lost his rider. After
reviewing the incident past the three quarter pole, the Stewards posted the official.

Footnotes
LUNAR PRAYER raced clear while angling in and rated the pace, came under pressure approaching the quarter pole, rounded the turn at the rail and was
steadily handled in the lane. RED PRIESTESS broke in and made contact with Risksrhighpayislow, gave chase through the backstretch and rounded the
turn about the four path, then dueled to take second just inside the sixteenth pole. KOBE'S GIRL came out and made contact with Risksrhighpayislow
leaving the gate, gave chase and rounded the turn off the rail, then dug in through the stretch to take third the final yards. QUEEN OF KANTHAROS
became fractious in the gate, gave chase inside and raced at the rail on the turn, then flattened the final sixteenth. LIME AFTER LIME chased inside, raced
near the rail on the turn, eased outward leaving the turn but showed little in the lane. BRANDYURAFINEGIRL gave chase, rounded the turn near the rail
then flattened stride. DIVA GAL gave chase and rounded the turn in the three path. SUPERSTASIA chased outside then weakened in the four path of the
turn. SOOEY'S PRINCESS broke awkwardly and never factored. RISKSRHIGHPAYISLOW was severely squeezed at the break, was never a factor
afterward and rounded the turn in the six path.

SAX saved ground on the first turn then eased out and gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and dug in leaving the turn to
take the nod in the final strides. SHINY PENNY stalked the early pace from the three path, closed to the front at the three eighths pole and raced clear from
the five sixteenths, dug in under steady encouragement leaving the far turn but gave up the nod in the final strides. PRACTICALLY THERE saved ground
racing well back from early contention, started a bid toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the four path, got up for third mid-stretch and
finished evenly. DANCE TO THE BEACH saved ground just off the pace, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then
flattened in the lane. SOCIAL EXCLUSION stalked the early pace two deep, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole but faded in the three path of the
far turn. CHIT CHAT GIRL was bumped out into the first turn, left the turn outside and showed little response. TORCH CARRIER rounded the first turn in the
two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. MORTAL STORM steadied off the heels of Torch Carrier and made contact with
Chit Chat Girl into the first turn, left the turn outside and was not a factor. LADY KAZA set the early pace inside, was met at the three eighths pole and faded
at the rail leaving the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
DONNIE B chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail, dug in for the lead past the eighth pole and raced clear leaving the sixteenth. IN THE LIMELIGHT
had a quick early lead then pressured the pace toward the seven sixteenths pole, took over two deep past the quarter, angled to the rail midway on the turn,
was met leaving the eighth pole but finished well for second. MY PHOENIX gave up several lengths when he dwelled at the break, but steadily improved,
steadied off the heels of Donnie B nearing the eighth pole then dueled for third. HARLEY SIOUX chased through the backstretch, raced in the seven path of
the turn then flattened later yards. NICE BUT NAUGHTY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the seven path and finished well outside.
CHARTERED COURSE save ground racing well back and could only improve her position. NEEDNOEXPLANATION closed to the front nearing the seven
sixteenths pole and set a pressured pace, was met at the five sixteenths and gave close chase from that point but was shut off and checked at the heels of
In The Limelight midway on the turn, drifted into the stretch and weakened. IMINCHARGENOW chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn in the four
path, eased outward leaving the turn but weakened in the lane. BOO TOO gave chase then faded in the three path of the turn. IT'S ONLY MONEY gave
chase and rounded the turn in the six path. The Stewards reviewed a claim of foul against the rider of In The Limelight for interference midway on the turn,
lodged by the rider of Neednoexplanation, and disqualified the former to seventh place for shutting off the latter. CHANGED TIMES FOLLOWING REVIEW.
