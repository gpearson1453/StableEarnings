left-handed urging and was up in the final strides. DUNKLE raced off the early pace three wide, advanced outside down the backstretch, took over two wide
around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch and led until the final strides. MEDIA SENSATION was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three
wide, angled out in upper stretch and rallied. STORMY VICTORY saved ground in range, steadied entering the far turn, angled four wide soon after and
rallied belatedly. MR. CELLULAR was bumped at the start, raced two wide in midpack and never threatened. NOTHNGOODCOMSEASY raced off the pace
two wide, bid between foes midway down the backstretch, chased inside around the far turn and faded in the lane. STREAMING TAP was bumped and
pinched back soon after the start, saved ground and made little impact. WHEATSHEAF tracked the pace three wide around the first turn, took the lead
midway down the backstretch, angled in soon after, vied inside around the far turn and faltered in the lane. ROCK SOLID WORDS dueled two wide and was
through after a half. MISTER SUPPA LOUIE dueled inside and stopped after a half.

Footnotes
OAXACA stalked the pace two wide, took over in upper stretch, edged ahead of the pace rivals nearing the eighth pole and held firm inside of MISS HOLLY
late. MISS HOLLY rated off the pace two wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, bid outside of the winner in midstretch but was unable to get
past. GIRLY THE BUTCHER was devoid of speed while saving ground, angled four wide in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and was just
up for the show. PRETTY PERSUASIVE saved ground off the early pace, advanced two wide between foes around the far turn, had aim in upper stretch but
was one-paced through the lane. ALWAYS CONNECTED stalked the pace inside and lacked a rally. QUEEN OF MINE set the pace along the rail and tired
in the lane. KAREN'S REVENGE played no factor while racing three wide.

LUNAR ROCKET rated from inside into the turn, was coaxed while tipping out to the six path going into the stretch, rallied past inner rivals passing the
eighth pole, and went clear. FIGHT broke in and raced from off the pace in the five path, was driven from said position into the lane, bid for the lead passing
the eighth pole, and ran on for place. NAVAL OFFICER chased in the two path, was roused while cutting the corner turning into the stretch, bid from inside
passing the eighth pole, but evened out to show. STRAIGHT TIME tracked in the four path, was coaxed entering the lane, but finished evenly in the stretch.
TOYI was sent to lead from the three path going into the turn, opened up from the two path turning into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. EL
BAILADOR stalked along the inside, but lost ground around the turn, and was tired. BLUEY trailed into the stretch and never menaced. PEINADITO
prompted the early pace between rivals into the turn but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
PACIFIC PRINCESS set the pace along the rail, dug in inside of VANDALIA in the lane, drifted out under left-handed urging and edged back ahead late.
VANDALIA settled off the pace two wide, advanced two wide around the far turn, reached near even terms in midstretch, was lightly bumped then was
forced out late. GREY CHARLOTTE stalked the pace in the clear two wide, chased inside around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and was
one-paced through the lane. RADIANT GEM settled off the pace while racing three wide, edged closer three wide around the far turn, made some progress
in upper stretch but could not sustain the bid. LA COSTA saved ground off the pace, swung out in upper stretch and lacked a rally. BEAUTIFUL STAR
saved ground in range and faded through the stretch. UNA LUNA was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, went three wide around the far turn
and lacked a closing bid. KATIESDREAMGIRL was bumped at the start, checked nearing the first turn and was never a threat while racing two and three
wide. FOLLOWING AN INQUIRY AND AN OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF VANDALIA, PACIFIC PRINCESS WAS DISQUALIED FROM FIRST AND
PLACED SECOND FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH.

FOREST SURVIVOR stalked from the two path, was roused while shifting out to the five path going into the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole, took the
lead, and held sway. LUCAGO raced from off the pace in the three path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, and chased home the winner for
place. NEVER SATISFIED rated in the five path, was coaxed around the turn, swung out to the eight path going into the lane, and kept on down the center
to get up for show. BARONE CESCO pressed from the three path, bid from two wide around the turn, led into the stretch, but flattened in the final furlong.
UNIFIED CONQUEST was fractious in the gate, broke slow, trailed into the stretch, and passed a pair of tired rivals. CRACK SHOT tracked in the four path,
was driven from the seven path into the stretch, but faded. TETRAGRAMMATON set the pace from inside into the turn, but gaveway at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
ALPHA BELLA stalked the pace inside, angled three wide near the quarter pole, moved to the front leaving the eighth pole, bumped with SRI LANKA soon
after, battled inside of that foe and prevailed. SRI LANKA settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, fanned widest
turning for home, closed outside, bumped with the winner leaving the eighth pole, dueled outside of that foe to the wire and just missed. PEDIGEEK saved
ground in midpack, bumped with SOLICITATION in upper stretch, bid between foes in midstretch but was no match for the top two. SOLICITATION
prompted the pace two wide, bumped with PEDIGEE in upper stretch, battled to midstretch and faded in the final furlong. STRAND OF GOLD failed to
menace while racing two wide. WELL INTO never threatened while racing three and four wide. WORST BEHAVIOUR set the pace along the rail and tired in
the lane. SEVEN P'S chased the pace two and three wide and weakened in the lane. MYSTIFY saved ground in range and lacked a closing bid. SEEKING
STARDOM played no factor while racing three wide. AL TIRAH hesitated at the start and was never involved. ACCIDENTAL ICON was outrun inside. AN
OBJECTION FROM THE RIDER OF SRI LANKA AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
BATTLE CRY set the pace from the two path, tucked in around the turn, was cued to open up from the three path into the lane, and was much the best. IT'S
SO EASY took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked the pace in the four path, dropped back around the turn, was driven from the seven path into
the stretch, and improved to get up for place. SHES ALL WOMAN bobbled at the start, tracked from the three path, was roused from the four path turning
into the stretch, but flattened out in the final furlong, and was caught by an outer foe late to finish with show honors. PENS STREET tossed her head at the
start and trailed from the two path, moved up from the rail around the turn and cut the corner into the stretch, but was one paced. MURUMBI rated along the
inside, was ridden around the turn and shifted out to the five path going into the stretch, but flattened. RAIN prompted the pace from the five path but
gaveway around the turn. LET'S BE HONEST rated from the seven path into the turn but was no threat. OUR FANTASY bumped an outer rival at the start,
was held up from the six path but was no menace.

Footnotes
GANGLY tracked the pace three wide, took over leaving the sixteenth pole and powered clear. AVANT GLORY set the pace along the rail, was collared
near the sixteenth pole and held on for the place. TIGER was up close inside, steadied near the nine-sixteenths marker, chased inside around the turn,
angled out in midstretch, rallied between foes and just missed second. STARSHIP RENEGADE raced off the pace four wide and had only a mild stretch
gain. MAGICAL WARRIOR pressed the pace two wide, put a head in front near the quarter pole, dueled past the eighth pole and weakened. ASSERTIKO
failed to menace while racing two wide. HANDSOME PRINCE threw his head just prior to the start then broke in the air well behind the field and was never
involved while racing two wide. SUNSET PROVISION had brief speed outside then retreated inside around the turn.

Footnotes
ERNA broke in and was bumped on both sides leaving the gate, stalked in the three path, moved up to bid two wide around the far turn, was cued from the
five path into the stretch, drifted inwards in the final furlong, and just held on. PENUMBRAS MAKER got squeezed at the start, raced from off the pace in the
four path, ranged up around the far turn and was hustled from the six path into the stretch, and ran on down the center for place. MRS. ASTOR stalked
along the inside, got shuffled back into the far turn, and had to angle out for running room, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, shifted out passing
the eighth pole, and rallied outside of rivals for show. MILIEU raced in midpack from the five path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, and kept on
while getting herded inwards in the final furlong. MORAL TURPITUDE broke out and bumped an outer foe, chased from the two path, was coaxed from the
three path into the lane, shifted inside for the final furlong, and stayed on but was forced to steady late. CUMBERLAND FALLS raced from wellback in the
two path, moved up around the far turn while swinging out to the seven path into the stretch, but finished evenly in the final furlong. ON THE PAYROLL set
the pace from the three path, was roused from the two path entering the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. MORE THAN A DIVA was held up from the
two path, cut the corner into the lane, but faded. POSHLY broke in and bumped with an inner rival, raced from wellback along the inside but never
threatened. LETTER OF GOLD trailed from the three path early and was no factor. SHEZ SPEIGHTFUL pressed the pace from the two path but gaveway
turning into the stretch. DARLING LUNA broke out and bumped between foes at the start, raced in midfield from the three path but backed up early around
the far turn.
