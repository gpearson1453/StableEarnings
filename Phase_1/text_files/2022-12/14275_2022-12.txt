Footnotes
JON L was off slowly, lost a considerable amount of ground, moved up from the inside around the far turn through the stretch run and finished strongly to
get up under strong encouragement. RIO HATO stalked the early pace from the outside of foes and finished well late to narrowly get up for the place
position late while continuing to race from the outside. CHA CHING CHARLIE pressed the early pace from the outside of foes, led near the eighth pole and
gave way grugingly. BIGG LIMO was forwardly placed to lay up close, came in nearing the three sixteenths pole, forced Who's On the Run to take up
sharply, experienced traffic near the sixteenth pole, kept on willingly to the wire, a stewards inquiry was filed and Bigg Limo was disqualified and placed sixth
for interference. DEACON BEACON showed good early foot to show the pace from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. WHO'S ON THE
RUN raced mid pack early on, moved up five wide, checked sharply near the three sixteenths pole and had no final bid. FEISTY TOWN raced off the early
pace, was near the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. CASH CRUZER was coaxed along early and faded. OLIVER TWISTED raced far back and
never threatened.

Footnotes
NOT THAT SERIOUS settled off the early pace, moved up from the outside through the far turn, continued and outside bid in the drive and finished well to
edge clear late under strong pressure. BLUEGRASS FAITH stalked the pace from the inside, continued to race from the inside in the drive and finished
gamely to the wire. ONOMATOPOEIA was slow early to race near the back of the pack early on, angled to race six to seven wide into the upper stretch and
made a good late gain. BESITOS CRIMINALES raced mid pack early, made a bid near the three eighths pole while racing five wide and flattened out in the
drive. MEMORY TAKER dueled for the early lead from the outside of rivals and weakened. NEXT AFFAIR was forwardly placed to lay up close, raced five
wide near the three sixteenths pole and weakened. STYLE BENDER dueled between rivals, checked near the quarter pole and was empty. NOT TODAY
SATAN raced mid pack early, was near the inside around the far turn through the upper stretch and lacked a bid. COMMISSIONER DAVID dropped back off
the pace, raced three deep around the far turn and never was a factor.

wire. A stewards inquiry was filed to review the stretch run and Mrquis Lights was disqualified and placed second for interference in the stretch run. ATILL I
CHIME vied for the early lead while racing two wide, bumped through the stretch run by Marquis Lights and finished gamely to the wire. DELIA was
forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced from the outside in the stretch and kept on to the wire. DESERT SPIRIT settled off the early going, raced
three wide near the quarter pole and moved up in the drive to improve position. SPECIAL PRIDE was allowed to settle early, made a five wide bid near the
quarter pole and flattened out in the drive. RIGHT FOR YOU was off slowly, raced at the back of the pack early, moved up from the inside around the far
turn, angled out and never threatened. EVIL TEMPTATION tracked the pace from the inside and faded. QUITE LOVELY failed to sustain a bid.

Footnotes
KIRBY DERBY raced off the early pace, moved up through the far turn from the outside of rivals, angled widest in the stretch run and finished well to get up
under strong pressure. BARBIERE raced five wide into the first turn, advanced into the far turn, raced seven to eight wide into the upper stretch, angled in,
split rivals near the eighth pole and finished gamely to the wire. MAGIC MOSCO raced five deep nearing the seven eighths pole, stalked the pace from the
outside, raced two deep near the quarter marker and kept on to the wire. DADDY WHAT IF was void of early speed, raced two wide near the quarter pole
and made a late gain from the inside to improve position. GLENDORA MINECAT raced mid pack early, was four deep through the far turn and raced evenly
with no closing run. UNTHROTTLED stalked the pace, raced near the inside past the three eighths pole and weakened in the drive. COWBOY COOL made
a three wide near the five sixteenth pole to challenge and faltered in the drive. SIGALERT set a fast pressured pace to duel early and gave way. PIRATE
JUNCTION dueled for the early lead from the inside and was done early.

game effort under strong handling. A stewards inquiry was filed for interference at the start and stewards disqualified Rockett's Red City for interference at

Footnotes
NO HUDDLE prompt the pace from the outside and finished well to edge clear under strong pressure. OKIE FREEZE showed good early foot, raced off the
inside in the stretch run and finished gamely to the wire. KEARNEY stalked the pace, moved up through the far turn, raced wide into t the stretch and
finished willingly to the wire. GREENBRIER raced mid pack early, was along the inside around the far turn and moved up late. TEQUILA coaxed along
early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. WILDCAT ECHO raced off the early pace, was three to four deep around the
far turn and had no rally. ASSISTANT dropped back early, angled widest through the upper stretch and had not enough. PARABELLUM raced off the early
going, was seven to eight wide into the upper stretch, shifted in and had no late closing run. DIRT BIKE SLADE raced from the outside in the lane and never
was a factor. KATRAKA raced along the inside through the far turn and lacked a bid. LONESTAR CHROME stalked the pace near the inside, shifted out
near the quarter pole and never threatened.
