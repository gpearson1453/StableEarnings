Footnotes
L STREET LADY vied for the early lead from the inside of foe and kicked clear in the drive to be well clear under steady pressure. NEW ROME prompt the L
Street Lady from the outside early on, hard ridden through the far turn and was no match for the winner in the drive. RECKLESS KELLY was slow early on
to race at the back of the pack, remained towards the back through the far turn while racing just off the inside, moved up four wide through the stretch run
and closed in belatedly to improve position. IRISH ZAPPER stalked the top trio down the backstretch, raced two deep near the five sixteenths pole, swung
seven wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no late run. MAJOR HOULIHAN raced off the early pace, was two to three wide around the far turn
lacked a rally. CAMILLA was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced along the inside past the quarter pole, shifted five wide and weakened the final
eighth of a mile. BRIGHT MOON was off a step slow, raced mid pack in the early stages and faded while racing from the inside.

QUICK TEMPO showed good early speed to assume command while racing in hand, continued to race in had around the far turn through the stretch and
was well clear to be an easy winner. ROYAL THUNDER chased the top pair early on, hard ridden through the far turn, angled off the inside through the
stretch run and was no match for the winner. MOJAC KAT raced mid pack early on, moved up four wide past the quarter pole and kept on to the wire while
racing from the outside in the drive. INSTIGATED raced off the early pace, saved ground around the far turn into the upper stretch and lacked a rally.
JIMMY THE KID was hard sent from the inside and faded. INDEFATIGABLE was off slowly, dropped to the back of the pack early, raced four wide in the
stretch run and never was a factor.

GALACTIC TIDE chased the pace from the outside for foes, raced three wide in the stretch and edged clear late under strong handling. CAMI RACHELLE,
taken to rate early, was shuffled back nearing the turn, regrouped to angle out and move up four wide past the quarter pole, lacked room between foes,
shifted out and finished well to get up for the place position while racing four deep. FIVE STAR FRAN stalked the pace, ran up heels just past the five
eighths pole, checked sharply, was fanned seven to eight wide into the upper stretch and finished willingly to the wire. SISTER SPIRIT stalked the early
going, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. JIMMYDABOOK coaxed along early from the outside of foes and raced evenly
no final run. GOLDEN BLOSSOM showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside of rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. ALWAYS
FORWARD was off slowly, raced with the second flight early, moved up five to six wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MIDNIGHT REVENGE
broke thru the gate pre-race, made quick move past the five eighths pole, lugged in, checked sharply and had no final run in the drive. SUSANAS
LUCKYCHARM raced off the early pace, checked, altered out over fallen rival while racing three wide and nevrer menaced. CARMEL SUNRISE was
bumped at the start, dropped back early on, checked nearing the three sixteenths pole over fallen rival and never threatened. BLONDE SAMARITAN was
bumped hard at the start, raced at the back of the pack early on, checked sharply over fallen rival nearing the three sixteenth pole and never threatened.
HAPPY TIME was bumped soundly at the start, raced off the early going, clipped heels nearing the upper stretch while racing from the inside, fell unseating

CAMP PENDLETON tracked the top pair down the backstretch while racing three deep, took command through the far turn and was clear late under strong
handling. OXIDE was allowed to settle early, moved up along the inside around the far turn, raced in a bit tight nearing the upper stretch, angled from the
inside to race well off the inside and finished well to get up for the place position. WELLING raced off the early pace, moved up three wide around the far
turn, angled six wide and had not enough for the top pair. MINE TO HOLD showed good early foot from the inside and weakened the final quarter of a mile.
RIDING CLOUD NINE showed good early foot from the outside of foe and gave way. LIFESPAN rated along from the inside of foes, angled out through the
drive and faded.

Footnotes
ALLIALLIOXENFREE showed good early foot to set the early pace and drew off to be clear under strong handling. BRZINA stalked the pace from the
outside of rival and finished well to be second best while continuing an outside run. THUNDER BOSS chased the pace while racing two deep and kept on to
the wire. I CAN DO IT broke awkwardly, raced at the back of the pack after the poor start, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in and
moved up late. LUCINA stalked the pace, raced along the inside around the far turn and weakened. LADY GANGSTER was off a step slow, raced three to
four wide and never was a factor. MIDNIGHT CHOIR raced along the inside, was pulled up and had to be vanned off.
