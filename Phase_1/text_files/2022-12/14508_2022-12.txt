Footnotes
KEANU had an awkward start and was out in the five path around the first turn, moved up to prompt the pace from the four path down the backstretch, bid
from two wide rounding the far turn, tipped out to the the three path going into the lane, and drew past the pacemaker in the final sixteenth to win.
SHANKAR stalked the pace from the five path, was hustled from said position into the stretch, ran on, and chased home the winner to finish with place
honors. CUTIE set the pace in the three path, was roused from the rail rounding the far turn, cut the corner into the stretch and dug in, but yielded to a pair
of outside rivals in the final sixteenth for show. FOR THE CHIEF raced from wellback in the two path, was bumped between rivals while being ridden along
turning into the lane, and passed tiring foes from the four path in the stretch. GET KHOZY was held up along the inside early, was driven from the six path
into the stretch, but flattened. TUMIGA trailed from the two path early, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but was no factor. LEAVENWORTH
rated in the four path, drifted inwards to the rail in upper stretch, and was tired. SMOKIN CLOUD raced from off the pace along the inside but was no
menace.

ACTION ROSE pressed the pace from the three path, was hustled around the turn, bid from the six path entering the lane, dueled with the pacesetter into
the final furlong, and drew past that foe inside the final sixteenth to win. LIVE LIKE LAURA bumped with an inner rival at the start, recovered well to set the
pace from the two path, was cued from the five path going into the stretch, and ran on but yielded to an outside rival inside the final sixteenth to place.
MACASSA stalked along the inside, was coaxed from the three path entering the lane, and finished evenly for show. PROMINENCIA chased from the five
path into the the turn, floated out to the eight path into the stretch, but was one paced. COSETTA rated from the two path, swung out to the seven path
going into the lane, but flattened. ANABELLA PRINCESS bumped with an outer foe at the start, tracked the pace in the two path, was ridden from the five
path into the stretch, but faded. WICKLOW LASS had a slow start and trailed throughout.

BOBBY'S GIFT settled off the pace while racing four wide, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. CHARMING CHARLIE raced off the pace
two and three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and ran on for the place. APPRAISAL dueled inside of foes in the two path down the backstretch, could
not quite keep pace in the two path around the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and kept trying to regain a slice. TOSCANITO stalked the pace three
wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole then weakened in the lane. FULTON STREET dueled between foes down the backstretch, vied at the rail
around the turn and tired in the lane. BYE BYE DAVID broke outwardly and bumped KIR KAHN at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. SIR
KAHN was bumped at the start then outrun inside. GOLDEN INDY played no factor while racing four wide. POSEIDON'S SON prompted the pace three
wide, bid between foes around the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
ROSIE'S HALO tracked the pace in the four path, ranged up from the five path around the turn, bid from the six path in upper stretch, and drew past an
inner foe in the final sixteenth to win. ADIOS BABY broke in at the start and prompted the pace from the two path, was roused to bid between rivals around
the turn, ran on while in the three path and took the lead into the final furlong, but was caught by an outer foe passing the sixteenth pole to finish with place
honors. AWESOME ANNMARIE bobbled leaving the gate, stalked the pacesetter from the three path, was coaxed from said position around the turn, drifted
out to the eight path passing the eighth pole, and finished evenly for show. BION MAGIC trailed from the two path early, was driven from the three path into
the lane, and passed tired rivals. TWIRLING GRACE chased along the inside, shifted out to the seven path entering the lane, but flattened. FRANKLY MY
DEAR bobbled leaving the gate but recovered well to set the pace from the two path, tucked into the rail around the turn, but gaveway at the top of the lane.
MORE GLORY rated from the three path early but never menaced.

Footnotes
SURROGATE was washy pre-race, rated off the pace in the three path, edged closer down the backstretch, bid in the three path nearing the quarter pole,
took over soon after, drew clear while drifting out under left-handed urging, drifted in under right-handed pressure near the sixteenth pole and held safe.
BORDER WAR trailed in the two path, made progress in upper stretch, angled four wide near the eighth pole and finished well to narrow the gap. TEPPER
tracked the pace in the two path for seven furlongs and was outkicked in the lane. GUARANTEED SPECK broke a bit awkwardly, raced off the pace two
and three wide and was one-paced through the lane. R ADMIRAL failed to menace while racing three and four wide. CONQUIST set a clear pace in the four
path, angled into the two path nearing the far turn, led to the quarter pole and tired inside. MY BROTHER KEITH was outrun inside.

Footnotes
INEVTABL CONECTION prompted the pace from the three path into the turn, was cued to bid from the four path turning into the stretch, took the lead into
the final furlong and drew clear. BACK TO NORMAL set the pace from inside, was coaxed when headed around the turn, cut the corner going into the lane,
yielded to the winner in the final furlong but held on to place. GIANNI LAMBO was hustled along from the three path into the turn, was driven from the six
path going into the lane, and kept on for show. NEOPHYTE chased along the inside but was one paced in the stretch. BLANK'S HAT TRICK stalked in the
two path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but flattened. CASSATION rated in the four path, swung out to the seven path entering the lane, but
was no factor. NEVER SATISFIED trailed from the three path into the turn and never threatened. JEST ABOVE raced from wellback in the four path but was
empty going into the stretch.

Footnotes
MAI TY ONE ON stalked the pace in the two path, closed between foes and was up in the final strides. TIZ ROMANTIC dueled along the rail, kicked clear in
upper stretch and was caught late. HIGH PRESS broke outwardly and bumped NEW YORK'S FINEST at the start, raced off the pace five and six wide,
lightly bumped with HANDSOME PRINCE near the sixteenth pole and rallied to gain the show. NEW YORK'S FINEST was bumped at the start, prompted
the pace four wide and was one-paced between foes through the lane. HANDSOME PRINCE chased the pace five wide, lightly bumped near the sixteenth
pole and evened out late. COOP TRIES HARDER failed to menace while racing three wide. TENURE hesitated at the start, raced well back two wide,
swung out nearing the eighth pole and had a mild belated rally. EXAMINER played no factor while racing three wide. EARTH was outrun outside. PRINCE
AMADEUS saved ground off the pace, steadied near the five-sixteenths pole and never threatened. C C'S KITTEN dueled in the three path and tired in the
lane. AWESOME BEACH chased the pace four wide and faded through the lane.
