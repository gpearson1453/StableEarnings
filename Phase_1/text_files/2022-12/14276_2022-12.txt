Footnotes
OUR ROSIE DIAMONDS broke out and was away awkwardly, moved up while angling out then tracked the pace on the outside, issued a challenge in the
four path around the turn, took over into upper stretch, shook clear inside the furlong marker and drew away under steady urging. FOLLOW THE FED came
out at the start then bumped with a foe, was taken in hand early then well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive and got up for the place while no match for the winner. IRISH EMPRESS was taken in hand early then stalked the pace on the outside,
came under some urging around the seven-sixteenths, gained to make a bid between foes in the three path at the three-eighths, turned into upper stretch
under a drive while still between foes, dropped back into the final furlong, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened but just held the show.
BLANCHIMENT angled in while going to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while challenged on the turn, lost the
advantage to the winner into upper stretch and tired. APRIL FIRST lost her footing at the start, settled at the rear on the outside, was urged along in the five
path around the turn, turned into upper stretch under the crop, drifted out in the final furlong and was no factor while placed under a protective hold late.
BANK HOLIDAY bumped with a rival just after the start, was taken in hand early then settled off the pace, dropped back leaving the backstretch, went two to
three wide on the turn and faltered then was eased in the final furlong but walked off.

Footnotes
MONSHUN broke out then was hustled, went to the front, moved clear near the five-eighths, vied inside while challenged on the turn, responded well under
threat from many foes in the stretch and held gamely under strong urging. RAFFINITY was hustled from the gate then taken in hand early before switching
to the outside, established a good position behind the leading duo, moved closer midway down the backstretch, ranged up three wide to make a bid with
three furlongs to run, fought on outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while just able to get the place. KEEN DANCER settled towards the rear,
saved ground around the turn, came three wide into the stretch, moved out while gaining in the final furlong and finished with good energy to garner the
show between foes while just missing the place. VILLAREGGIA settled off the pace, saved ground early on the turn then angled five wide around the
three-eighths, rallied outside while remaining on her inside lead in the stretch, closed to make a bid late but just missed the trifecta while clear for the last
spot in the supefecta. PRINCESS PINKY settled off the pace, was urged three to four wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked
the needed response. U CANT HANDLE THIS was hustled from the gate, pressed the pace on the inside, dropped back while intimated some inside of the
winner nearing the five-eighths then switched to the outside, chased in the two path early on the turn, dropped back later on that bend and tired. VOICE OF
SPRING was hustled from the start, moved in while urged along towards the back, traveled around the turn in the two path, came five wide into the stretch
and failed to threaten. EXFILTRATION dropped back leaving the chute, raced at the rear, was urged three wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch
and was no factor.

Footnotes
I'M BUZZY hustled from the gate, chased along the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive and had what once was a usable seam close up some near the eighth pole and tipped out to the two or three path at that station, ran on behind
rivals tipping out to the five path a sixteenth from home, then surged late to just get up in the shadow of the wire and score. CUPIDS GIRL coaxed from the
start, raced three to four wide in aim of the leader coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun three wide for home, rallied to take narrow command a
furlong out, dug in under threat from TRUE EMPRESS and came out under a left handed crop herding that rival and leaning on her a sixteenth from home,
then got nailed on the wire by the aforementioned foe. TRUE EMPRESS tipped out just after the start to chase five paths off the inside down the
backstretch, continued five wide through the turn coming under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive
issuing a challenge through the final furlong, got herded out a sixteenth from home and leaned on by CUPIDS GIRL before finding herself between rivals
knocking heads late and was denied at the end. DEVILLY coaxed from the gate, showed the way from the two path under pressure from LADY FIREFOOT
and then that rival as well as CUPIDS GIRL, came under coaxing near the quarter pole in response and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug
in under threat and was collared a furlong from home, then got out-finished in the late stages while keeping on to the finish. LADY FIREFOOT coaxed from
the start, prompted the pace of DEVILLY from the outside in the three path, got shaken off with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper
stretch and weakened.

the advantage into the final furlong and drew off under a moderate hand-ride to win ridden out. VIOLENT ROCK broke out then was corrected by the rider,
was rated just off the pace, came under urging while saving ground on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and won a head-bob for the place
while no match for the winner. HANG TIGHT broke out at the start, was hard ridden towards the rear, saved ground on the turn and improved position to just
get the show while out-nodded for the place. NICHOLAS JAMES bobbled at the start then was bumped and forced out, raced outside under coaxing,
chased four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and missed the trifecta while getting the last spot in the superfecta. ACHILLES HEEL was rated
just off the pace, came under urging in the three path around the turn and failed to rally. BALI'S SHADE broke out and bumped with a foe, disputed the pace
on the outside of a rival, vied in the three path while continuing outside that foe around the turn, dropped back in the four path into upper stretch and tired.

rallied to take command a furlong out, dug in tussling to the finish with SNICKET and gamely prevailed at the end. SNICKET coaxed from the start, chased
three to four wide in closest aim of the leader coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide for home, took command at the three-sixteenths,
dug in and was headed a furlong out, fought gamely head to head to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end. VIOLENT VIXEN broke in at the start
bumping PATTY H solidly into EVERYONELOVESLINDA while shutting off SISTER ANNIE and was uncorrected while eliminating half the field from the get
go, showed the way in hand three paths off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under threat
yielding the front with three-sixteenths to run and weakened. PATTY H got bumped solidly at the start by VIOLENT VIXEN breaking in and in turn bumped
EVERYONELOVESLINDA while squeezing off SISTER ANNIE, chased five wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung four then three wide for
home and weakened. SISTER ANNIE got squeezed out at the start due to pressure outside coming from VIOLENT VIXEN, chased six then five wide under
coaxing from the three-eighths, went five wide for home and tired. EVERYONELOVESLINDA got bumped solidly at the start by PATTY H due to pressure
from VIOLENT VIXEN breaking inwards, chased four wide early on and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from midway, continued in the
two path into upper stretch and faltered.

Footnotes
LARZ showed good speed, disputed the pace on the inside of a rival, vied in the two path while still inside that foe around the turn, shook clear while put to a
drive in upper stretch and drew off under strong urging. WARRIOR RICHARD was bumped hard on both sides at the start, settled towards the rear, lost
action and leapt while coming outward leaving the backstretch and dropped back while taken up some, moved from four to three wide while regaining
momentum early on the turn, was roused for more near the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch and secured the place while no threat to the
winner. SCOOTSCOOT was hustled from the gate, contested the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn and tired while able to hold the
show. TWO CHUCKLES broke out then bumped hard with a foe, moved out while urged along off the pace, dropped in late on the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn and lacked the needed response. SECRET THUNDER broke out at the start, settled near the back on the outside, was urged five
wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. BASIC TRUTH bumped hard with a rival at the start, was well placed behind the
leading duo, lugged out some leaving the backstretch, dropped back under urging in the two to three path on the turn and came up empty. OBSCURED BY
CLOUDS broke out at the start, was coaxed along on the outside, dropped back four wide on the turn,, spun five wide into the stretch and faltered. ENZO'S
WORLD was urged along at the rear, went three to four wide on the turn and also faltered.

Footnotes
JEMOGRAPHY went to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path on the turn, responded well when asked for his best in upper
stretch and held under steady handling. DURKIN'S CALL was hustled from the start, chased the pace on the outside, went five then four around the turn,
pursued the winner in the stretch and finished willingly for the place. QUICK RETURN was hustled from the start then hard ridden while chasing the pace,
went three wide on the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and lacked the needed kick while able to get the show. GANDY DANCING settled under
some urging, moved closer late on the backstretch, issued a challenge in the four path early on the turn, moved to the three path later on that bend, dropped
back into upper stretch and tired. BRONX BOMBER was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn and capitulated.
DOUBLE SHOT stumbled at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the turn, moved to the two path outside the
quarter-pole and was no factor. TAPIZEARANCE hesitated at the start and was off a bit slow, moved out while hard ridden off the pace, went three then four
wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. MICROSCOPE raced well back in the field, went three wide on the turn and was
no factor. ACALTEQUE settled off the pace, was urged four to five wide on the turn and failed to respond.
