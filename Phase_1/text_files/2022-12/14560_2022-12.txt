Footnotes
BLAME IT ON EDDIE was unhurried early, rallied on the far turn five wide, closed determinedly and drew clear late. NOBLE BEHAVIOR set the pace while
racing well off the rail, swung wide in the stretch, could not match strides late with the winner but held place. HARD N'SWEET had good position throughout,
rallied in the stretch, steadied at the eight pole while between horses and went evenly late. GEH SCHNELL was unhurried early, angled in stretch and had a
mild bid. DETERMINATOR was never far back while five wide, lacked a late response. GOTSOMEMOJO was unhurried early and passed tiring rivals. I
BELONG TO BECKY had good position on the inside and tired. AMERICAN FLEET raced mid pack and was no threat. JURISDICTION was no factor.
THIRSTY ACTOR raced close up early and was through after a half. The stewards posted the inquiry sign and the rider of HARD N SWEET claimed foul
against the rider of NOBLE BEHAVIOR for alleged interference in mid stretch. After viewing the tape the stewards took no action.
