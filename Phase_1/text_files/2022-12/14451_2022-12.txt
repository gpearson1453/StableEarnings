MISSGREELEY'SSONG was unhurried early on, raced in hand until the quarter pole, raced from the inside around the far turn into the upper stretch, angled
three deep and surged clear late under steady handling. SHE'S MY PRIORITY prompt the early leader from the outside while racing two wide, led nearing
the sixteenth pole and was wore down to finished second best. GLORY TO ME settled off the early going, made a three wide near the quarter pole and kept
on to the wire. WHO DAT GREY showed good early foot to set the pace along the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. CUSTOM MAIDEN raced
off the early pace, hard ridden through the far turn, raced four deep into the upper stretch, shifted in and had no late rally. SPECTACULAR IZZY tracked the
early pace while racing just off the inside and gave way.

BRYKEN N MITCHELL stalked the early pace, moved up two wide near the quarter pole, angled to raced four or five deep and got up late under strong
handling. CORN SOUP chased the early pace from the outside of foes while racing three wide, led deep stretch and missed in a game effort. OGA BEAR
showed good early foot to race just off the inside, had a clear lead near the eighth pole and gave way grudgingly. MARKETBOOK was bumped at the start,
raced off the early pace, moved up from the inside and improved position. AHIMAAZ raced mid pack early on, was four to five deep in the lane and had not
enough. SPRY CHARLIE dropped back to race mid pack, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and raced evenly with no rally. GENIUS was
squeezed back at the start, raced four wide in the drive and never was a factor. DOUBLE BOGEY raced off the early going, was fanned six to seven wide
into the upper stretch and had no late rally. LOOKIN FOR LARRY pressed the pace from the inside and faded.

Footnotes
WOODS N WATER was rated to race in hand early on, ridden past the three eighths pole, moved up three wide between near the quarter pole and finished
well to draw clear under strong handling. JAYS HOLIDAY raced off the early pace, made an advance through the far turn, was six to seven deep into the
upper stretch and finished gamely from the outside. CHEERFOR MSHAWISH was bumped, shuffled back at the break, raced mid pack early on, made a bid
five deep near the quarter pole and finished gamely to the wire. HEZA PICKLE settled off the early pace, moved up four wide between near the quarter pole
to challenge and flattened out. SOULOLOGY was off slowly, moved up five wide nearing the five sixteenths pole and raced evenly with no final run. THEO
D'OR was forwardly placed to lay up close and weakened while racing two to three wide. PAPIRINGO showed good early foot to set the early pace and
gave way. JAMAICAN ME was bumped at the start, stalked the pace from the outside of foes and faltered in the drive.

Footnotes
WOO HOO chased the early pace, moved up four wide near the quarter pole while racing from the outside of foes and finished strongly to be well clear late
under strong pressure. SUMMERTIME BANDIT was hustled along, raced near the rail and was no match for the winner late. SEGOVIANA was off slowly,
raced near the inside and moved up to improve position. I'M ALL MIXED UP vied for the early lead from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile.
GIRL IN BLACK chased the early pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and raced evenly with no final run. MOLLYS FLYIN HIGH was hustled along,
raced three to four wide around the far turn and weakened. CASH BIZNESS pressed the early pace while racing two wide outside of foe, raced in a bit tight
just past the quarter pole and faded. MY REBEL GIRL raced off the early pace, was near the inside and lacked a bid. SARAH ADRIANA shuffled back at the
star, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never menaced. ALYS EPISODE was hustled along early from the outside and tired readily while racing three
to four wide.
