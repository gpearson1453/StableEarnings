Footnotes
ANCIENT PEACE took control early while keen and moved to the inside, set the pace under pressure to the far turn, maintained a short lead through the
bend, shook free in upper stretch and drew off under urging. TEA TREE BAY (GB) was off slow to begin, stalked between early, took aim at the top pair two
to three wide into the stretch, was no match for the winner in the late stages but got up for second. CARSON JEN rated in the two path early then went up to
press the pace on the backstretch, challenged to the top of the stretch, could not go on with the winner outside the eighth pole and got edged for the place.
JENNIFER'S D'LIGHT chased three deep early, continued in the three path into the far turn, entered the lane two wide and lacked a bid. AUTISM
COMMUNITY pulled early then got knocked into outer rival entering the first turn, continued to fight the rider around the bend, trailed two wide into the far
turn, angled over to the rail and improved position. BOLT'S BROAD broke a step slow and bumped leaving the gate, moved inside while at the back into the
first, took hold around the bend, moved out widest on the backstretch, went five wide into the far turn, three wide into the stretch and could not rally.
MAHINA rated on the inside stalking behind the leader early on, coaxed while saving ground through the far turn, put to right handed urging in upper stretch
and faded. LUMINIFEROUS brushed with rival leaving the gate, drifted out and bumped rival into the first turn, settled inside off the pace, trailed along the
rail into the stretch and was not a factor. LA PEER broke a step slow on the outside, chased four deep near the back into the first turn then got bumped into
the bend, traveled four wide into the far turn and had to pause when lacking room between rivals early on the far turn, exited that bend three wide and had
little left for the drive.

Footnotes
SALTO DE TIGRE settled inside, came out and bumped ALLABOUTTHEMONEY while launching a bid four deep, took over at the eighth pole, dueled
through the final furlong and gamely prevailed. ALLABOUTTHEMONEY stalked on the inside early then moved off the rail on the backstretch, got bumped
by SALTO DE TIGRE in upper stretch while making a move five deep into the final furlong, fought outside that rival through the late stages and could not get
by. SITTIN ON GO broke a hair slow, settled between early then off the rail, traveled three then four wide on the far turn, rallied six deep in the stretch and
gained the show. WARRENS CANDY MAN vied four then three deep around the first turn, remained alongside the top pair in the middle stages, challenged
for command three wide through the far turn, fought to the eighth pole but was no match in the leaders in deep stretch. SETTECENTO vied for the lead two
wide into the first turn then moved to the rail, dueled up the backstretch, battled with outside pair around the second bend, lost command with a furlong
remaining and weakened. SONIC BREES vied for the lead three deep early then in the two path on the first turn, inched ahead into the backstretch, dueled
into the far turn, fought between rivals around the bend, stayed on to the eighth pole then weakened in the furlong grounds. TODAY MATTERS settled three
deep early, chased four then three wide on the far turn and had little left for the stretch run. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF
ALLABOUTTHEMONEY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST SALTO DE TIGRE FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN THE STRETCH RUN. AFTER A REVIEW,
THE STEWARDS RULED THAT THERE WAS CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO RIVALS BUT THE INCIDENT WAS MINOR AND DID NOT WARRANT A
DISQUALIFICATION.

Footnotes
CLASSICAL CAT stalked the pace along the inside, tipped to the two path on the far turn, bid three deep in the stretch and drove by FIRST PEACE late.
FIRST PEACE was closet in pursuit in the two path early then applied pressure on the backstretch from outside, headed GAME TIME around the far turn,
took over in upper stretch, held a short lead into the final sixteenth and succumbed to the pressure late. NAGIRROC tracked two wide then between foes on
the clubhouse turn, coaxed along outside a rival on the far turn, spun three wide into the lane, bid four deep into the stretch, finished willingly but lacked the
needed late punch. GAME TIME cleared and moved to the two path then along the rail on the first turn, set the pace under pressure up the backstretch,
headed by FIRST PEACE on the second bend, relinquished the lead in upper stretch and flattened to fourth. MALIBU COAST trailed on the inside early,
went two wide into the second bend, angled out and came four wide into the stretch, kept on through the drive but failed to threaten. AH JEEZ chased the
pacesetter three deep, dropped back on the far turn, trailed two wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
PAPALE dueled for the lead outside NOLO CONTESTO, inched ahead nearing the quarter pole, put to left then right handed urging in the lane, carried the
advantage while battling rivals on both sides into deep stretch and held gamely to the line. CLUB CAL raced two wide near the back, traveled along the
inside into the far turn, tipped three wide leaving the bend, moved out further and rallied four deep in the stretch and could not get by the winner. CHIPPER
bumped rival entering the first turn, chased two to three wide then moved out on the backstretch, stayed off the rail and was on the move in the three path
through the second bend, bid three deep in the lane but lacked the needed late kick in the final sixteenth. NOLO CONTESTO dueled for command inside
PAPALE, asked left handed into the stretch, switched to the right hand in upper stretch and faltered in the late stages. STAR SAILOR steadied when put in
tight by NOLO CONTESTO entering the first turn, chased the top pair on the inside into the far turn, driven two wide into the lane and lacked a bid. SOCAL
RED unhurried in the beginning on the inside, passed a rival on the far turn and traveled a bit off the rail into the lane and failed to menace. GRANADA
FLAVOR was last away but still broke cleanly, traveled three then four wide around the first turn, rounded the second bend in the three path and was not a
factor. HOOP DREAM bumped with inner rival into the first turn then went three to four wide around the bend, dropped back to last on the second bend and
trailed two wide into the drive and tired.

Footnotes
CARVER sped to the front and moved to the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, kicked clear on the far turn, met the challenge from the runner-up
outside the sixteenth pole and held well. SAN ANTON (IRE) dropped back in the beginning and steered to the inside, saved ground to the stretch, then
tipped out and rallied outside the leader but lacked the needed late kick to get by. SINGLE TRACK MIND (IRE) bumped leaving the gate, raced in mid-pack
along the rail, guided off the inside but had to wait in traffic on the far turn, tipped out to a clear path and raced three wide into the stretch, moved out further
in the lane and finished willingly outside the top pair for the show honors. GENIUS JIMMY bumped in the beginning, traveled two wide then between rivals
early, came four wide into the stretch and kept on to round out the superfecta. SHADOW CREEK (IRE) traveled three deep towards the rear on the
clubhouse turn, angled in on the far turn, moved out in the lane and kept on to improve position but never reached contention. JEWELED SHILLELAGH
steadied along the rail when crowded into the first turn then pulled a bit while keen early, stalked behind the pacesetter, saved ground to the stretch, drifted
inward and had to be corrected in upper stretch and could not produce a bid. FLEET FEET tracked two to three wide early, coaxed outside rivals on the far
turn and flattened down the lane. KEEN TO GO raced two wide at the back into the first turn then had to check off heels around the bend, trailed up the
backstretch, tipped out on the far turn, lacked room behind rivals and checked again in upper stretch and failed to menace. AZURE STAR (IRE) rated in the
two path stalking the pacesetter, lost ground and positions on the far turn, chased two wide into the drive and faded. STONKS pulled early while outside
rivals on the first turn, dropped back on the far turn while a bit rank and trailed four wide into the lane and tired.

Footnotes
ONE SILK STOCKING stalked three wide into the turn, moved into the two path around the bend, got floated out into the lane, took over in upper stretch
and held the runner-up at bay. KITTY KITANA (GB) raced two wide outside a rival off the pace, came out crossing the dirt, rallied from outside but faltered in
the final sixteenth. HONEY JAR vied for the lead from between rivals early then dueled inside a rival down the hill, lost command in upper stretch and
flattened to third. SHE'S GOT A WAY went up to vie for command inside pair of rivals early, could not keep up with those rivals and chased around the turn,
came out into the stretch and churned on for a minor award. ROSE MADDOX was off slow to begin, trailed off the rail around the bend, moved out in the
lane and kept on to improve placings. SLEVKA (FR) tracked two to three wide around the bend, drifted out into the stretch and could not respond to urging.
BRIEFCASE GIRL saved ground on the inside off the pace, steered off the rail in the lane and proved no menace. BIG NOVEL broke a step slow, dropped
back and angled to the inside then moved into range early, came off the rail around the bend and weakened in the lane. AMERICAN LILY vied three deep
early then dueled around the turn, could not keep up into the final furlong and gave way. AAS DE FAUST (GB) got put in tight along the outer rail and had to
check hard early, chased three deep then got forced out crossing over the dirt, bothered by rival near the eighth pole and weakened. IZZY EM was forced to
steady early, traveled two wide near the back into the turn, angled out into the stretch and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
BROADWAY GIRLS sprinted to the front and took control of the rail, showed the way up the backstretch, coaxed on the far turn, asked right handed
entering the stretch and remained clear to the wire. MANHATTAN JUNGLE (IRE) bumped with inner rival at the start, stalked in hand on the inside behind
the leader, cut the corner into the stretch, could not summon the needed late kick to reach the winner but finished willingly to best the rest. AMI PLEASE
broke alertly in the beginning then took a stalking position outside a rival in the two path, pushed around the far turn, chased within range through the lane
and finished evenly for the show. TEA N CONVERSATION had to alter out from behind a foe early then traveled outside a rival at the back, asked two wide
around the far turn, found the rail in the stretch then moved back out a bit and summoned a mild rally. THEBESTISYETTOBE (IRE) settled along the three
path, was on the move four deep on the turn and three deep into the stretch but could not find the needed late kick in the final furlong. NAUGHTY LOTTIE
tracked on the inside then started to pull early, went two wide into the far turn then had to pause when in a bit tight between rivals, urged along two to three
wide and weakened down the lane. SPANNING THE GLOBE dropped back and steered to the inside, became rank and had to steady when running up on
heels early, continued to fight the rider on the clubhouse turn, settled in the middle stages, saved ground through the far turn, moved off the inside in the
stretch and failed to make an impact. DECORATED MY LIFE (IRE) traveled in mid-pack along the two path early, angled four wide around the far turn and
could not rally. PLEASANT WAVE raced in range outside a rival, entered the far turn three wide, got shuffled between rivals around that bend, entered the
lane three wide and faded. RAGTIME ROSE became rank early while moving inside, saved ground to the stretch and failed to menace. G LAURIE bumped
with outer rival leaving the gate, raced in the two path towards the rear, angled out on the far turn, eased in the lane and walked off.
