Footnotes
HINDU MISS CHEF broke sharply then was hustled along to duel for the lead with HER PERFECT VISION from the inside, opened a clear margin with a
quarter to run and drew off as a handy winner. HER PERFECT VISION was away alertly to duel for the lead with the winner while racing three-wide, was no
match for that rival in the drive but finished well to save the place. EYES FOR GOLD lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out
further in mid-stretch and finished with good energy. JEWEL OF DENIAL showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor.
LOTSA LACE was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. CAMDEN HIGH settled off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened.

HIJO GALANTE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and was up in the closing yards. PRAYER OF JABEZ
was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the lane, reached the fore with a furlong to run but could
not resist the winner late. PAUL VINCENTS POEM settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with a steady bid. COLOR
ME LEGENDARY raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. LESLIE'S GOLD
chased the leaders from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. MACCHIATO D'ORO sprinted clear soon after the start, raced three-wide while
setting the pace and weakened after going a half. FULL VISION lagged throughout.

Footnotes
BESAME MUCHO tracked the leaders from the inside, angled out approaching the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and drew clear. BLUE
PARADISE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out into the stretch, could not gain on the winner late but finished with good energy to
gain the place. BOURBON AND WATER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. DEVIL'S OFF DUTY
pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, led and gave way in the drive. RENEW raced off the pacesetters
early, moved six-wide through the turn and was not a factor. SEAFARING WILDCAT was away in good order to set a pressured pace from the inside and
weakened through the final furlong. EVIL ROCKS lagged throughout.

Footnotes
CLASSIC TASTE broke sharply to duel for the lead with DADS ESTRELLA while racing three-wide, disposed of that rival after going a half, opened a clear
lead into the stretch and drew off with complete authority. DADS ESTRELLA dueled with the winner from the inside, gave way after going a half to that foe
and stayed on well to save the place. STAR FINALITY lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and finished
with some late run. TIZ THE PROSPECT chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. LUTE'S DIAMOND was void of early speed,
raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. PHOENICIAN MAGIC was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened.
BABY JOY raced off the pacesetters from the inside and weakened in the drive. DONNA'S MISCHIEF lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn
and did not threaten. PRINCESS JAYLEEN was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
MOSQUITO FLEET stalked the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command with a furlong to run and edged away late. EL MAESTRO
pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths pole, led and gave way grudgingly to the winner late. SHOTGUN
RIDER settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished with a steady rally. SPIRE showed no early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and finished with a belated bid. MARK YE WELL lacked early foot, raced off the rail through the turn, reached a
contending position but lacked the needed late response. CANNONBALL COMIN was forwardly placed early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the
three-sixteenths pole and gave way soon after. GRAY MAGICIAN lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
AUTOPILOT raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and did not menace. DUSALUT
sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and weakened through the final furlong.

Footnotes
JAMMINJL lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the turn, responded when set down for the drive and was up in the closing yards. ELDORADO
DREAM dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not match strides with the winner late.
BOISTEROUSLY IRISH disputed the pace with ELDORADO DREAM from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. ALICESHOUSEOFHEART
settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SMILING THUNDER chased the leaders from the inside, angled out
approaching the stretch and gave way in the drive. BE TOUGH showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. PLUMA raced
off the pacesetters early, steadied nearing the nine-sixteenths pole and weakened.

Footnotes
SIR DEPUTY came to to impede rival at the start, opened a clear lead soon after, responded when challenged nearing the quarter and drew off as a handy
winner. WEAR THE CROWN was reserved just off the leaders from between foes, angled out in mid-stretch and held the place. PARLEY STREET was void
of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled in nearing the sixteenth pole and finished with good late energy. THE PUBLIC HALO steadied
soon after the start, was reserved just off the leaders early, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the quarter and gave way in the drive. TEXAS LONG
BOW settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. TAPIT AT MIDNIGHT showed no early speed, raced three-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. DON'TTEASETHETIGER was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and gave way after going a
half. UNCLE FLOYD raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. TALKIN MALICE was void of early foot, raced
four-wide through the turn and failed to threaten. PHANTOM MAC lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and did not offer a bid. LIL LATIGO
was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not menace. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF THE
PUBLIC HALO LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SIR DEPUTY CONCERING HIM COMING IN SOON AFTER THE START AND CAUSED THE
PUBLIC HALO THE STEADY AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS DISQUALIFIED SIR DEPUTY FROM FIRST AND PLACED HIM FOURTH.

Footnotes
BRIX settled off the leaders early, steadied nearing the half, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths marker and
was up in the closing yards. PINTXOS broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to engage nearing the three-sixteenths marker,
vied and just missed. FORT LANGLEY raced off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady bid. MOVE OVER
(GB) raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position and failed to gain late. XTREME V. I. P. lacked
early foot, raced four-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. BODEMONSTER was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn,
angled inside with a furlong to run and did not menace. SENSEMAKER was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside and gave way through
the final furlong. VINTAGE KITTEN was pinched back at the start, showed no early speed, raced seven-wide through the second turn and did not offer a
bid. NORTHRNDANCRSGHOST was forwardly placed from the inside and gradually weakened. SILVER DASH showed brief speed and weakened. THE
RIDER OF FORT LANGLEY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST BRIX AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS THE STEWARDS MADE NO CHANGE.
