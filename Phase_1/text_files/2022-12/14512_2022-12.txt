Footnotes
DANCIN DEE raced in the two path around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, launched a bid from the two and three path
coming around the far turn and drew off down the stretch under a drive. A RING THING saved ground around the first turn, dueled on the rail up the
backstretch and around the second bend and was no match for the winner in the lane, chasing that rival to the finish. MISS CALIFORNIA hit the gate
leaving it, trailed the field from the three path around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and flattened out in the final furlong. BELLSWILLBERINGING raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace setter on the
outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and faded in the lane. TIZ LOTTIE raced in the middle of the pack in the four
path through the opening half mile, dropped back to trail the field while saving ground around the second bend and was empty in the stretch. KISSING
FROGS raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the final turn and
tired in the lane.

CHINA BEACH raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began a bid passing the half
mile pole, took over while racing in the two path around the far turn and drew off in the stretch. THE SKIPSTER saved ground around the first turn, chased
the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the second bend from the two path and was no match for the winner in the lane but kept on to
the wire. MAGICAL ADVENTURE raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the five path and gained
ground late. TAPINTOYOURBEER bumped with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch at the
back of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the three path and improved position between horses in the final furlong. JUST PRAISE stalked
the leader from the three path through the opening half mile, challenged while saving ground headed into the far turn and weakened in late stretch.
RUNAWAY TOM bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, raced in the five path around the first turn, came up the backstretch off the pace on the
inside, continued around the far turn in the four path and never threateneed. SHIMMERING LEROID raced in the two path through the opening quarter of a
mile, tracked the leader between horses up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path and faded in the lane. GUNMAN raced in the two path
around the first turn, led the field up the backstretch, gave way while saving ground around the second bend and tired from there.

HANDSOME PLAYBOY was reluctant to load, broke well and tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear while drifting mildly in late stretch. CALL ME ICE MAN pressed the pace between horses early,
navigated the turn from the two path and chased the winner home in the lane. MIKEY BANANAS raced off the pace between horses through the opening
quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two and three path and improved position in the stretch. BRIGHT FORECAST hopped up slightly leaving the
gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. MAJESTIC PHAROAH led the way on
the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane. SENTIR ZULIANO was away from the gate slowly, trailed the field on the
outside in the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path and was empty from there.
