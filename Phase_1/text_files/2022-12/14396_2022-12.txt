Footnotes
APPRECIABLE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and was ridden out through the lane to be kept to task. SEVEN SISTERS
chased the winner from the inside throughout, was no match for that foe in the drive but finished well to hold the place. EVEN PANDURA showed no early
speed, raced seven-wide through the turn and finished with good late energy. VALUE DANCER was off slow, settled just off the leaders early, moved
three-wide through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished willingly. LARIMAR chased the leaders while racing five-wide and gave way in the
drive. RED VENUS chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened through the final furlong. BIG CYN raced off the pacesetters early, moved
five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally.

Footnotes
SUE ETTAS GHOST showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, angled out into the stretch, reached the fore with a furlong to run and
drew off as handy winner. UPTOWN RHAPSODY lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in the drive but
finished well to gain the place. CHA was off a step slow rushed to the lead, opened a clear margin, responded when challenged nearing the half and gave
way through the final furlong. QUEENS RANSOM was forwardly placed from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter and finished evenly late. JACANA
chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way gradually after going a half. SUNNY LANE raced five-wide through the first turn, moved up to offer
a bid nearing the half and weakened soon after. SPICY SOMMELIER was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a
factor.

Footnotes
PROVOST set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the quarter, responded when challenged by UNBROKEN STAR nearing the three-eighths
marker, re-cleared into the lane and held that rival safe late. UNBROKEN STAR appeared hard to rate, moved up four-wide to offer a bid nearing the
three-eighths marker, responded when set down for the drive and finished with good courage. PAINT ME LUCKY pressed the pace while racing three-wide
and stayed on well in the drive to finish willingly. FINAL FINAL lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with a steady rally.
NORTHERN QUEST pressed the pace from the inside and gradually weakened. PERFECT COME BACK settled off the leaders from the inside and lacked
the needed rally. GORKY PARK was forwardly placed from between foes and weakened after going a half. HAVEULOSTYOURMIND showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
TUMAC MOUNTAIN pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid with a furlong to run, vied with DEVIL'S TEETH and proved best through a
vigorous drive. DEVIL'S TEETH disputed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, vied with the with through the final
furlong but could not get by that foe. BLESSED JOURNEY lacked early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with
good late energy. CHEF showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with a belated bid.
LINEMANS CHECK raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the turn, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths marker and finished evenly.
FULL DRAW lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. UNCLE FLOYD settled off the leaders from the inside, moved up for a
contending position but failed to gain late. STONUS MAXIMUS dueled for the lead while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half. CREST DRIVE
was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. INCLUDE HOO lagged throughout.

Footnotes
START A RUNNIN was away in good order to set a pressured pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and drew off through the lane with complete authority. BLUE SKYE JADE pressed the pace of the winner while racing three-wide, could
not match strides with that rival in the drive but was clearly second best. FINAL ROSE lacked early foot, saved ground through the second turn, remained
inside for the drive and finished with a steady rally. ECHO ALPHA SIX settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and finished
evenly. FOUR O'FIVE raced off the pacesetters early, moved four-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. KATZUMOTO raced off the
leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn and lacked the needed rally. OUR DANDY'S BOY lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the
second turn and did not offer a bid. ITS BIG was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. OUTLAW BY NATURE
showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn and did not offer a bid. THEMANBEHINDTHEMAN chased the leaders while racing
three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. ADDED THREE-QUARTER FRACTIONAL TIME FOLLOWING REVIEW..

CODE FIVE was away in good order to stalk the dueling leaders while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew off
through the lane in a convincing manner. ARIZONA ANDREW broke sharply to duel for the early advantage with BRANDYN while racing three-wide, was no
match for the winner through the final furlong but finished well to be clearly second best. BRANDYN disputed the pace with ARIZONA ANDREW from the
inside and gave way after going a half. CHARLIE'S MAN settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run.
PANZER PRIDE showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BIG TIME ROB lacked early foot, raced five-wide through
the turn and did not menace. BRENSON BUNS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
ARIZONA KALEI was away in good order to stalk the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to take command nearing the quarter and drew clear.
SHARP ATTITUDE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, drifted in nearing the three-sixteenths pole and finished with a steady bid
when clear. BANGIE GO pressed the pace from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the five-sixteenths pole and gave way in the drive. UNRIVALED
QUEEN was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn, angled out into the stretch and finished with late energy. BEYOND AWESOME sprinted
clear at once, raced three-wide while setting the pace, checked nearing the quarter and failed to gain late. GRACIE'S A TIGER was forwardly placed early,
moved four-wide through the turn and lacked the needed late respone. BRIEF NOTE lagged far back early, moved four-wide through the turn and was not a
factor. DAHLIA'S DANCER showed brief speed and weakened. PRINCESS JAYLEEN was off slow, settled off the leaders and weakened in the drive.
REASON TWO LIVE was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid.
