Footnotes
SMART SPENDING bumped after the start with an outer foe, was held up along the inside early, shifted out and loomed up from the six path around the far
turn, was bumped by an inner foe at the top stretch, swept past inside rivals into the final furlong, and held sway. MIDNIGHT BELLA saved ground around
the first turn, chased from the four path down the backstretch, was ridden from the five path around the far turn, swung out to the eight path into the lane,
and ran on down the center for place. ASTERS D'ORO prompted the pace in the three path, bid around the far turn while drifting out to the five path turning
into the stretch bumping the eventual winner, and held on to show. DAKOTA DANCER broke out and brushed an outer foe at the start, set the pace from
inside, was coaxed from the three path into the stretch, but yielded going into the final furlong. LADY DOMINANCE was in the two path around the first turn,
tracked from the four path down the backstretch, was driven from the six path into the lane, but was no factor. SHORT CIRCUIT bumped with an inner rival
after the start, stalked in the four path but faded going into the stretch. RIVETING SPIRIT trailed throughout from the two to four path.

PLUMA ROJA bumped with GOTTA GO GATOR at the start, saved ground off the pace, advanced along the rail around the far turn, closed inside while
drifting out under right-handed, took over leaving the eighth pole, battled inside to the wire and prevailed. GOTTA GO GATOR bumped with the winner at
the start, set the pace in the two path then fought on outside when collared leaving the eighth pole. E J'S WAY saved ground in range early, angled four
wide nearing the far turn, had aim outside of the pacesetter in upper stretch, continued on the left lead in the lane and flattened out. TAPIT'S DIRECTION
pressed the pace in the three path and weakened in the lane. GEMSTONE WARRIOR veered out and steadied early, steadied along two wide between
foes around the first turn, raced along the rail around the far turn and never threatened. MAJOR DEAL broke a bit awkwardly, chased the pace three wide
and faded. CAPODECINA failed to menace while racing three and four wide. ZACH AND JILL trailed outside.

Footnotes
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT prompted the pace in the three path, had to steady slightly into the turn, was put under a ride from the two path around the turn, swung
out to the four path into the lane, and rallied past inner rivals in the final furlong to get the win. SMALL REASON had a slow start and raced from off the pace
in the two path, was cued from the five path around the turn, got herded out to the seven path by an inner rival entering the lane, and ran on from the center
to get place honors. LEE ANN'S WARRIOR chased in the three path, drifted out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. OLD TOWN
ROAD stalked in the four path, bid from the three path around the turn, drifted inside passing the eight pole bothering an inner foe, and flattened in the final
furlong. EXALTED CHARM tracked along the inside, lost ground while under a drive around the turn, and was no factor from the four path in the stretch.
ENSIGN PARKER was sent to lead from the two path early, was roused when headed around the turn, cut the corner into the stretch, and was forced to
steady passing the eighth pole while giving way. SHANGHAI WARRIOR broke straight out at the start and bumped the end of an outer foe, trailed
throughout from the five to seven paths. AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER OF ENSIGN PARKER AGAINST THE RIDER OF OLD TOWN ROAD FOR
INTERFERENCE AROUND THE EIGHTH POLE WAS UPHELD AND OLDTOWN ROAD WAS DISQUALIED AND PLACED SIXTH

Footnotes
SONG RUNNER set the pace in the two path and drew off under a drive. JACKSON'S WEBB tracked the pace three wide, was no match for the winner in
the lane but stayed on to hold clear of the rest. ADMIRAL'S WAVE saved ground off the pace and was along for the show. JRUE BREEZE chased the pace
four wide and faded in the lane. BOBBY'S CANDY chase the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. FIVEFIVE SIX CHAMP failed to menace while racing
four wide. WARP SPEED BEAST hopped at the start and trailed inside.

Footnotes
PARKLAND stalked from the two path, was coaxed while looming up from the six path going into the lane, bid into the final furlong and drew past in closing
stages. LAMPLIGHTER JACK prompted the pace in the three path, took over the lead from the four path around the far turn, was ridden into the the stretch,
but was caught in the final sixteenth to place. ONENIGHTSTANDARDS trailed from the three path, was cued from the four path around the far turn, and
finished evenly in the stretch for show honors. ATTENTIVE rated along the inside, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but flattened.
EPIMYTHIUM chased in the three path, was coaxed from the five path turning into the lane, but was no factor. CHARLES CHROME set the pace from
inside but gaveway turning into the lane.

Footnotes
MUGURUZA set the pace in the two path, drifted out a bit in the lane and held clear under a drive. RAISON THE GLASS saved ground in midpack and
stayed on inside of foes to gain the place. DEMURELY chased the pace inside, angled three wide near the three-eighths pole, was ridden along to keep
pace with the winner around the turn and was one-paced through the lane. SHE'S OUTTA HERE broke inwardly and bumped UNCAPTURE FAITH at the
start, had some early speed, dropped back three wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and had a mild rally. SHES A GIFT chased the
pace four wide and faded in the lane. UNCAPTURED FAITH was bumped at the start, raced two wide and never threatened. BLAME THE VETS played no
factor while racing four wide. TWIN CAUSE was outrun inside.

DREAMSTER broke out and bumped between foes at the start, rated from the four path, loomed up from the five path around the turn, bid from the seven
path into the final furlong, and edged past an inner rival closing stages to win. SHE'S AWESOME broke out and bumped at the start, tracked the pace from
the four path, bid from four wide turning into the lane, led passing the eighth pole, but was caught in the final sixteenth to place. HOT FOOT SUSIE was
fractious in the gate, stalked along the inside, was in tight while cutting the corner entering the lane, and finished evenly to show. MIDNIGHT IN ALASKA
bumped with an inner rival, prompted the pace from the three path, shifted out to the four path turning into the stretch, but flattened. MYSTICAL JOURNEY
trailed from the six path into the stretch and was no factor. RITA MARGA was hustled along from the rail but was no threat. LIANA B set the pace from the
two path but was eased in upper stretch, pulled up, and walked off.

Footnotes
SOUL OF AN ANGEL settled off the pace, went three wide around much of the turn, circled five wide near the five-sixteenths pole, kicked clear turning for
home, angled into the two path and held clear under a drive. AVOW raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail near the five-sixteenths pole, cut the
corner into the lane and stayed on to be clearly second best. THREE WITCHES was bumped at the start, raced off the pace five wide, bid nearing the
quarter pole and failed to sustain that bid in the stretch. LIAM'S KISS broke outwardly and bumped FRECCIA D'ARGENTO into THREE WITCHES at the
start, stalked the pace in the four path, could not keep pace nearing the quarter pole but kept trying outside to improve position in the lane. FRECCIA
D'ARGENTO was bumped between foes at the start, chased the pace inside and came up empty in the lane. POIEMA set a fast pace in the two path and
faltered in the lane. SEND FOR ME disputed the pace three wide and retreated through the stretch. PER THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, SOUL OF
AN ANGEL HAS BEEN DQ'D FOR A POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
ROYALLY BLUE broke in and bumped an inner foe at the start, pressed the pace while three wide into the turn, bid from the five path going into the stretch,
led passing the eighth pole, drifted out in the final sixteenth, and held on. NAY SAY (IRE) got squeezed out at the start, trailed from the three path, swung
out to the eight path turning into the lane, and rallied down the center to get up for place honors. BABY'S DIALED IN broke in at the start, stalked from the
five path, ranged up from the seven path turning into the stretch, and kept on but was forced to take up in final strides to finish with show honors.
TWEAQUED broke out and bumped an outer foe, dueled along the inside, was cued from the two path into the stretch, and dug in but yielded inside the
final furlong. LOVE MY JOB tracked in the the three path, was roused from the five path into the stretch, but was one paced. QUEEN CASHMERE was
bumped between rivals at the start, rated from inside, cut the corner into the lane, but flattened. GAM GAM JOANN broke in and bumped on both sides at
the start, dueled for the lead while two wide, was driven from the four path into the stretch, but gaveway. AN INQURY WAS HELD LOOKING INTO
POSSIBLE INTERFERENCE NEAR THE WIRE AND AN OBJECTION WAS LODGED BY THE RIDER OF BABY'S DIALED IN AGAINST THE WINNER,
ROYALLY BLUE, FOR THE SAME INCIDENT. WHILE THE STEWARDS ACKNOWLEDGED THE INTERFERENCE IT DID NOT EFFECT THE RESULT
OF THE RACE SO THERE WAS NO CHANGE.
