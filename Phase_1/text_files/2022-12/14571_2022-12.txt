chased the winner from the start, dropped back on the turn then came on again late in the five path to finish clear for second. SEEYOUINMOTOWN stalked
the pace along the inside and went evenly. NO MORE MARGS offered a mild bid three wide on the turn then came up empty. BONNIE'S BEST failed to
menace. HERE COMES DOLLY dropped back from an alert start and trailed.

second. WILDCAT PRIDE vied for the lead along the inside and went evenly. LAMBRUSCO battled with the winner two wide down the backstretch, chased
that one into the stretch then faded. HOTROD BOBBY had brief speed. MEDIA DARLING was no factor.

along in time. NICEASAKITTENSEYES trailed early, swung wide, closed fast in the middle of the racetrack and got up for second. SCARLETT'S AWISH
was antsy the gate, sped to the lead soon after the start, set the pace in the two path for nearly a half, battled until deep stretch then was outfinished.
SWEET EMPIRE had a mild rally late in the six path. PROPER ETIQUETTE vied for the early lead, slipped through along the rail on the turn to make the
lead before a half, matched strides until deep stretch then was outfinished. PROPHETESS offered a mild bid four wide nearing the top of the stretch then
leveled off. VICTOR STORY was no factor. DIAL AGAIN pressed the pace three wide into the stretch then stopped. OUT MY DEAR also antsy in the gate,

Footnotes
AUNT BEE settled outside, moved up steadily, surged late under left handed urging and got up in the final strides. PERFECTINGTHEVIEW chased the
pace into the stretch, made the lead late inside and just missed hanging on. GRIZABELLA settled mid packed and finished with good courage two wide.
LUCKY PENNY ROSE slow early, found her best stride late two wide. DIVA POWER away alertly, set the pace with a clear lead, widened on the far turn,
drifted out in mid stretch and was outfinished. WOLFIE'S PRINCESS passed tiring rivals. MOBIL CHIC offered a mild bid along the inside into the stretch
then leveled off. CATABOUT was through after a half. EDGE OF NIGHT was fractious in the gate and had brief speed. MY PIE also fractious in the gate,
was outrun. MOBIL LADY stalked the pace three wide into the far turn then faltered. EARLY BLOOMER had speed for a half then stopped.
