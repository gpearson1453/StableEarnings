SURE ENOUGH away alertly, stalked leader to turn, rallied, held game to the wire. SIMPERING SMILE good position never far back to stretch, coming on
too late. GO ON GIRL quick break to the lead, cleared to turn, dueled stretch, gamely. DARTIGA had a tardy start only to improve position in the stretch run.
BASILICA D ORO unhurried to the turn, moved up in the stretch while no threat. PRICELESS PICTURE chased top trio from off rail to the stretch, faltered
late going. ONTOTHENEXT never menaced throughout. PRINCESS TONI chased top pair to the turn, gave way readily. MIDNIGHT XO good position
widest to the turn, gave way readily in the stretch. VICTORY'S FLAME squeezed at the start with little chance from that point. MARTZ CREEK MUSIC never
factored throughout.

LOOKIN TO FLY unhurried to far turn, rallied outside, cleared, vigorous urging. MS MERRABEL sprinted clear to lead, well handled, could not contain
winner. SUPERTALEOFHOUDINI awkward from the gate, no speed to far turn, rallied along for third. WILD TAPIT good position with a rail run to the
quarter pole could not go on. RUNAWAY MOM broke a bit slow from the gate, no speed to far turn, improved position. CROSSED UP never menaced
throughout. HOT HEELS stumbled badly from the gate, lost best chance from that point, saved ground while never far back, no late kick from far turn.
BELLE OF ST. JOHN had an awkward beginning while never getting untracked. ETELKA failed to menace. SOUTHERN SKY never in contention.
NOTREALLYNOTREALLY staggered from gate, chased leader to the half, gave way. MISSAWLET tracked leaders to far turn with nothing left for the
stretch run.
