Footnotes
DALLAS settled back saving ground on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole and steadily improved in the four path of the far turn, closed to the
lead nearing mid-stretch and drew off the final sixteenth. TOUT ENSEMBLE rounded the first turn about the four path and settled off the pace into the
backstretch, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, drew close in the three path on the far turn then dueled through the stretch to take second the final stride.
LINDA'S TAJ took the lead nearing the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, was met toward the three eighths pole but kept the edge
at the rail on the far turn, gave up the lead mid-stretch and was outfinished for second the final stride. POLICE WOMAN tapered in and stalked off the rail,
challenged three wide nearing the three eighths pole, raced close off the rail on the far turn then flattened leaving the eighth pole. SWEET VALERIA saved
early ground then gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and showed little in the lane. MIDSUMMER NIGHTS settled
off the pace inside on the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path then weakened. GILDED
QUEST stalked off the rail, dueled to a slim brief lead between horses nearing the three eighths pole, continued in close chase past that point but weakened
leaving the far turn. SUDDEN FLARE was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPRING THE BEAST tapered in and stalked four wide, closed to the lead nearing the three eighths pole, dueled clear approaching the quarter, raced at the
rail on the turn but drifted into the lane, dug in to the challenge of Scintillio from the eighth pole and recovered a clear margin in later yards. SCAREDY CAT
saved ground on the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, progressed in the five path of the far turn
then dueled through the stretch to take second the final yards. SCINTILLIO stalked the early pace three wide, challenged leaving the half mile pole and took
a slim brief lead at the seven sixteenths, was soon overcome but pressured Spring The Beast through the backstretch, contested at a close disadvantage in
the three path of the far turn, eased out into the lane but dropped back mid-stretch and flattened later yards. EARTHQUAKEDIRECTOR rounded the first
turn in the three path and raced outside into the backstretch, gave chase past the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the six path and finished
evenly outside. THEHEATOFTHENIGHT settled off the pace toward the inside on the first turn, eased out into the backstretch and picked up the chase
nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened. UNIMPEACHED saved ground on the first turn then bid mildly from
the seven sixteenths pole. DIVINE PROPORTION settled back off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the seven sixteenths pole, rounded
the far turn in the three path and flattened stride. TYRY TYRANNOSAURUS showed little response through the backstretch. SPUNTACULAR closed to the
front two deep into the first turn, was met toward the seven sixteenths pole and engaged in close chase from that point, but dropped back at the rail nearing
the quarter pole and weakened leaving the far turn. FIRST CRUSADER had a brief early lead inside then stalked into the first turn, gave chase nearing the
seven sixteenths pole but gave way past the five sixteenths.
