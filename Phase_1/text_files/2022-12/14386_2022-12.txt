Footnotes
SBAGLIATO sat behind INTERSTELLAR in the pocket along the inside, was roused around the far turn while tipping out to the five path entering the lane,
bid passing the eighth pole, and drew past inside the final sixteenth. JEBY chased from the four path, was coaxed while moving up from the six path around
the far turn, swung out to the seven path going into the stretch, and chased home the winner to place. HARBOR MOON was brushed by an inner foe
leaving the gate, recovered well to set the pace from the three path down the backstretch, tucked in around the far turn, was coaxed from the three path into
the stretch, and kept on to hold show. GAMBITO rated from inside, was driven along while swinging out to the eight path turning into the stretch, and stayed
on down the center. ROYAL SALUTE tracked in the four path, moved up to bid turning into the lane, but evened out in the final furlong. NOSTALGIC ONE
broke outward and brushed an outer rival, raced from off the pace in the three path, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but flattened. JUNIPERO
SERRA was unhurried in the five path early, was hustled from the six path around the far turn, but weakened in the stretch. INTERSTELLAR led from the
inside around the first turn, took back to prompt the pace from said position down the backstretch, but gaveway turning into the stretch. HARD TO FATHOM
was bumped by an inner foe at the start, raced from wellback in the three path and was empty entering the lane. GRAPHENE CASSOCK broke out and
bumped an outer rival, stalked in the five path but backed up around the far turn. MR JACK was caught in the five path around the first turn and was always
behind.

CURLINS CHOIR pressed the pace from two wide, made a bid around the turn, took over and was cued to open up from the three path entering the lane,
and was much the best. OUT FOR MYSELF was sent to lead from the rail into the turn, was coaxed while cutting the corner into the lane, yielded to the
winner, but held on to place. STEPHANIE MY LOVE was coaxed along between rivals into the turn, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and was
one paced through the stretch to get show honors. COSETTA rated along the inside, was driven along from the three path into the lane, drifted in, and was
tired. GI GI'S GOLDEN GAL prompted the pace from three wide but faded in the stretch. LA BUFFALITA was hustled along from the four path into the turn
but was done early.

Footnotes
ARI GOLD set the pace in the two path, drew clear down the backstretch, continued in the two path around the far turn and widened under a drive in the
lane. LIGHTS OF BROADWAY saved ground in range for six furlongs, angled out in upper stretch, could not gain on the winner but finished well to hold the
place. CONGRUENT raced two wide between foes early, was quite rank rounding the first turn, settled down the backstretch, race along the rail in midpack
around the far turn, angled out in upper stretch and gained the show. SENDERO settled off the pace while racing three wide, went four wide around the far
turn and lacked the needed rally. ANAMNESTIC chased the pace four wide around the first turn and three wide around the far turn and faded in the lane.
BRUMBA WAFFLE TOES played no factor while racing two wide. MAXIMO was outrun inside. DANGEROUS RIDE pressed the winner in the three path
around the first turn, chased two wide around the far turn and retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TALENT stalked the pacesetter from the four path, bid for the lead midway around the turn, took over and was cued to open up from the five path
entering the lane, responded well and was wrapped up late. CAROLINA TRAFFIC set the pace from the two path, was roused when headed midway around
the turn and cut the corner into the stretch, yielded to the winner going into the final furlong, and held on to place. NO DELIBERATION tracked the pace
from the four path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, flattened out in the final furlong, but held show. BARAK rated from the two path early,
drifted out to the eight path in upper stretch, and was tired. MATRO chased along the inside, lost ground around the turn, and was no factor. AWESOME
MARINA raced from wellback along the inside, was ridden from the four path into the stretch, but was no threat. TAKING WHAT'S MINE had a slow start
and trailed throughout from the five path.

Footnotes
MERCURY HEAD was bumped between rivals leaving the gate, stalked in the four path, tucked in around the turn, tipped out to the five path going into the
lane, was herded out while making a bid into the final furlong, and drew past in closing stages. QUEEN CALYPSO broke out and bumped an outer foe,
dueled for the lead from two wide, led and was cued from the five path into the lane, kept on while drifting out on an oncoming rival, and was caught inside
the final sixteenth to finish with place honors. ADIOS BABE broke in and bumped with an inner foe, chased in the three path, was roused around the turn,
swung out to the five path going into the stretch, but finished evenly to show. POLITELY CROWNED was bumped by an inner foe, trailed from the two path
into the turn, and passed tired rivals from the four path in the stretch. SAMMY'S TOWN tracked along the inside early but was never a threat. GOLDEN
ISLE broke out and bumped an outer foe, dueled for the lead from inside, was driven from the two path into the lane, but gaveway.

Footnotes
JUNIPERMARSHMALLOW settled off the pace while racing three wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, took over leaving the eighth pole, drew
clear while drifting out under left-handed urging and held safe. MALLEYMOO hesitated at the start, trailed inside for a half, advanced four wide around the
far turn, swung widest in upper stretch and finished strongly. STEPHANIE'S CHARM saved ground off the pace, steadied near the three-eighths pole,
remained well back inside around the far turn, swung out in upper stretch and rallied for the show. PERSONAL PURSUIT hit the starting gate, raced two
and three wide in midpack and stayed on between foes to gain a minor slice without seriously threatening. DELIGHT stalked the pace three wide, reached
near even terms in upper stretch but weakened through the final furlong. ISABEL ALEXANDRA (IRE) saved ground in range, angled out in stretch and was
one-paced. LADY AZTECA saved ground and failed to menace. BORN DAPPER chased the pace two wide and faded in the lane. VAI BELLA pressed the
pace two wide, took the lead near the three-eighths marker, vied two wide around the far turn, kicked clear in upper stretch then wilted leaving the eighth
pole. HEAVENS EXPRESS played no factor while racing three wide. BEL PENSIERO set the pace along the rail and faltered in the lane.

FLY THE W bumped with an outer rival out of the gate, tracked the pace from the three path, took over from the two path rounding the far turn, was cued
and opened up going into the stretch, and was much the best. MOMZA was held up from the four path early, was driven three wide around the far turn,
tipped out to the five path entering the lane, and kept on to secure place. RACE CRAFT trailed from the four path, swung out to the eight path going into the
stretch, and improved down the center to get up for show. WICKED FINN rated along the inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but evened
out. POPPY'S BOYS was unhurried from inside, was driven between rivals around the far turn, tipped out to the four path into the stretch, but was one
paced. MR MATUSCHEK raced from wellback in the four path, swung out to the seven path going into the stretch, but flattened. UNCLE ARMANDO chased
in the five path, was roused from the four path around the far turn, but faded in the stretch. TIMMY M. bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced from off
the pace in the five path but weakened in the stretch. MAJOR WAGER stalked along the inside but yielded going into the lane. MAN ON THE MOON set the
pace in the two path but gaveway rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
CADET CORPS settled off the pace while racing two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, closed strongly through the stretch, seized command
near the sixteenth pole and quickly cleared. PERFORMING ARTS tossed his head just prior to the start and was off very slowly, raced off the pace three
wide, advanced four wide around the far turn, rallied between foes in the lane, reached near even terms near the sixteenth pole but was no match for the
winner late. BENELUX lacked speed while racing three and four wide, angled wider in upper stretch and rallied for the show. THENORTHREMEMBERS
tracked the pace three wide, bid in upper stretch, briefly led but weakened through the final furlong. KITTEN'S SPA chased the pace four and five wide and
lacked a closing bid. SASSY BUT SMART pressed the pace in the three path around the first turn, vied outside down the backstretch, set the pace in the
two path around the far turn, battled to midstretch then tired. DAZZLING TRUTHS saved ground in midpack early, went three wide around the far turn and
never threatened. REBELDE set the pace in the two path, was collared early on the backstretch, resisted inside into the far turn and faltered nearing the
lane. JIMMY D played no factor while racing two wide. OFFICER COUNTRY was hard held while appearing to try to get out around the first turn, saved
ground in range and had little left for the drive.
