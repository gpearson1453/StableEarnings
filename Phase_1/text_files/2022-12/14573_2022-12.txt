DANCE A LITTLE JIG was allowed to settle early, advanced three wide on the turn and came four wide into the lane, closed well to get up in time to prove
best, driving. ALONG THE WAY stalked the pace three wide, made a three wide bid nearing the quarter pole, took over leaving the turn and was clear by
the furlong marker, but was caught late to just fail. GREAT BARONESS was four wide into the first turn, set the pace while off the rail, was headed by the
quarter pole and gave way. LOOP THE LOOP was settled early on the in side, then shifted off the inside and was three wide on the turn, came five wide into
the lane and had no rally. OH SO JAZZY chased the pace on the inside and weakened. ESTA CHUCK was reserved early and failed to menace. SEEKING
THE THRONE was not a factor.

LA FAMILIA set the pace while in the two path, was well handled and kicked away leaving the furlong marker and then was kept to pressure to prove best.
MORE RANSOM was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the lane and closed well. SONG SAVER stalked the pace and made a
three wide bid nearing the quarter pole but flattened out late. TAK E LADY was well placed on the inside and faded in the lane. MELODIA was reserved
three wide early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. JACK'S LILLY was rated along early, shifted out and was four wide by the quarter pole
and then was empty in the lane. DENALI RAE was reserved on the inside and had no response. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
RONIN WARRIOR was allowed to settle, moved two wide into contention, then made a inside move leaving the quarter pole and drew clear leaving the turn
and then drew off to prove much the bets,, ridden out. ALWAYS FORGIVEN was reserved early, advanced three wide on the turn and came five wide into
the drive and finished wrll to be second best. VISHNU stalked the pace three wide and faded, got show award late. BAVARIA vied for the lead three wide,
made a two to three wide bid on the turn and shook clear but weakened in the drive. PIGGYBANK was settled back early, advanced on the turn and came
four wide into the lane and lacked a solid rally. AULD LANGE SYNE was five wide into the first turn, chased the pace four wide and tired. ROLLING
PALISADES vied for the lead on the inside and tired. DIAMOND SETTER was not a factor. BANANAS ON FIRE chased the pace on the inside and
stopped.
