the inside to the five sixteenths pole, shook loose to take a clear lead and tired late in the stretch. MY LITTLE GUERA saved ground throughout, made a
mild bid on the final turn and flattened out. ST MARIA raced near the back to the final turn then made a four wide bid and closed well. MAVE RUNNER
raced in the middle of the pack off the leaders and passed tiring rivals. I LOVE YOU MORE was allowed to settle to the final turn but only improved her
position. GOLD CHAIN was unhurried early and not a threat. ANIME DAY dueled for the lead from the two path and gave way at the quarter pole. T J'S
SUNSHINE was six wide into the first turn then dueled for the lead from the three path to the quarter pole and stopped.

placed close up in the three path throughout but was no match for the winner. TEMPRANO was placed off the pace from the two path down the backstretch
made a rail bid on the final turn and missed the place. HIGH RIDGE raced in the middle of the pack from the inside and passed tiring rival in the drive.
GRAND PRIORITY was off a step slow then hustled along early, went four wide into the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack, made a mild bid on the
backstretch and finished evenly. WISH UPON A STAR was unhurried early then made a three wide bid on the backstretch and flattened out. NOW NOW

FINAL QUEST was within striking distance down the backstretch, made a three wide bid going into the final turn, engaged the leader at the three sixteenths
pole and took the lead at the eight pole, dueled to the wire and held on. COURTLY DOC raced in the middle of the pack from the three path made a looming
four wide bid on the final turn, engaged the leader at the three sixteenths pole, dueled to the wire and proved second best. NONEYA was tardy at the start
spotting the field several lengths, settled near the back down the backstretch made a two wide bid on the final turn then moved out to four to five wide in
upper stretch to make a late rally for the show. HALF PAGE sprinted to the lead from the inside was challenged at the three sixteenths pole and gave way
grudgingly. SCRAPBOOK was placed off the pace in the two path to the final turn lead briefly between calls at the five sixteenths pole and weakened.
CHARGED TEMP was allowed to settle on the inside to the final turn then angled out but lacked a response. DADDY HEY DADDY was always back. A. K.
A. GRAMS tracked the leaders from the inside and dropped back.

Footnotes
MAJESTIC WAYS was hustled to the front to take a clear lead and drew off to prove much the best. JUBELLA vied for the early lead from the two path then
settled off the pace down the backstretch made a two to three wide bid on the turn to prove second best. GATOR PROUD raced near the back to the final
turn then moved three wide but was no match for the top two. EILEEN ALEXANDRA was unhurried early made a four wide bid on the final turn for a late
run. MISS CHARLIE SIOUX was roused to challenged for the lead while going four wide into the first turn, was forwardly placed down the backstretch and
gave way in the drive. BEYOND THE HYPE was in the middle of the pack but not a factor. AKIANE'S SOLDIER was allowed to settle near the back but not
a threat. TEXAS RED BEL was placed close up early on the inside and slowly retreated. PRESSLY'S HOPE saved ground but was through early.

to take the lead at the sixteenth pole and cleared late. GOTTEMINABIND vied for the lead from the two path, engaged the leader at the three furlong pole
and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and was caught late. WHY KENZLY trailed the field to the final turn went five wide in upper stretch, dropped to
