Footnotes
LAST COOKIE reserved back to the half, launched a strong run while ridden out as much the best. FULL MAG dueled inside to far turn, stayed on gamely
while no match for the winner. CODE ONE had an awkward start, rushed into first turn, backed up far turn and came back late to just miss the place spot.
KING SHAMAN tracked from three path, kept on in stretch run, just missed show. GO FOR IT raced along evenly from off rail, could not go on from far turn
and flattened out. COLLECTORATE outside run to far turn, made a bid but flattened out in the lane. VELOCIMO dueled from two path to quarter pole but
could not go on and faded. NORTHERN RUNNER unhurried with no response when needed in the drive. NEW ART never factored throughout.

late. BLUE NORTHER unhurried to far turn, rallied into the stretch for show spot. EL AHIJADO no speed to far turn, improved position in the late stages.
WRITEITONTHEICE race along to far turn, inside stretch run with no late gain. MINT failed to seriously menace. MINISTERIAL had no speed and failed to
menace. JAY VEE BEE chased leader off rail to far turn, gave way readily from there. ONE COOL DUDE sprint clear outside to the lead, gave way into far
turn. ONE LUCKY DAY checked first turn, never menaced thereafter. THE HONORABLE ONE had a tardy start, never close throughout and distanced
