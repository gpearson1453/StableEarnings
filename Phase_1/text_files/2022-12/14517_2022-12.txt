FIELDSTONE tracked three wide, bid entering the far turn, led turning for home, drew off in upper stretch, and was driven into the final sixteenth. SEEKING
SPLENDOR laid off of the pace along the inside, pursued two wide and around the far turn, stayed on between horses in upper stretch, and reached place
at the sixteenth pole. PATH TO SUCCESS pressed two wide, bid for the lead along with an outer foe into the far turn, but gave way to that rival in upper
stretch, and lost place a sixteenth from hom. MOUNT KENYA laid off of the pace four wide, came into the lane in the five path, but failed to change leads
while lacking a bid. SERGEANT RECKLESS stalked along the inside, but faded approaching the three furlong pole. FLAT OUT AMERICAN set the pace
along the inside, but was headed by a pair of outer bidders entering the far turn, and weakened approaching the five sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
LA FEME JOLIE pressed two wide around the turn, bid entering the lane, inched an advantage from her inner game counterpart in upper stretch, and held
determinedly to the wire. MISS PRIORITY rushed forward after breaking a step slowly, set the pace along the inside, dug in in the two path to resist LA
FEME JOLIE's bid at the quarter pole, shifted down to the rail while getting headed in upper stretch, yet fought on doggedly thereafter, but failed to regain
even terms. MACEE stalked along the inside, failed to slip inside of the leading pair while blocked at the quarter pole, altered course outside of those foes at
the three sixteenths pole, but lacked a kick to produce a bid in the final furlong, and chased the leaders home. SWEET VIDALIA laid off of the pace in the
five path, and failed to factor. THE GREY BEAUTY chased three wide into the turn, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
KEEPCALMCARRYON laid off of the pace along the inside under a snug hold turning into the backstretch, improved inside of rivals into the far turn, tracked
from the two path around that bend, tipped outside of the clear leader while inching closer entering the lane, swept past that foe leaving the three sixteenths
pole, and drew off. CARTIER CAT tracked two wide and between horses, chased the clear leader from the four path as that one's closest pursuer around
the far turn, got outkicked by an inner rallying rival nearing the lane, kept on while hanging on his left lead, then changed over at the furlong grounds before
completing a bid for place nearing the final sixteenth. HE'S GOT THIS tracked three wide, bid chased mildly to bid for place between horses at the furlong
grounds, but was outkicked. CLARESTOWN pressed two wide, tugged clear entering the backstretch, managed a clear margin around the far turn, but
offered little resistance to KEEPCALMCARRYON's bid at the three sixteenths pole, and faltered. TEXAS BLUEBONNET was brushed by rivals on either
side at the start, tracked along the inside, but was shuffled back behind a tiring UNCLE NICK down the backstretch to trail at the half mile pole, then gained
subtly around the far turn, shifted out in upper stretch, and came up empty. SOLID COUNTRY GOLD raced at the rear two wide, then four wide around the
far turn, but made little impact. UNCLE NICK set the pace along the inside, but failed to keep pace with an outer rival entering the backstretch, chased
before weakening approaching the half mile pole, was through entering the far turn, then eased through the lane.

Footnotes
A RUNNIN AFLEET broke a step slow at the start, stalked three wide, bid turning for home, vied with an inner CCED FOR STEPH before wrestling an
advantage at the furlong grounds, and edged clear through the final sixteenth. DOLLY'S GUITAR trailed in the four path into the turn, gained four wide
turning for home before fanning to the seven path entering the lane, then stayed on willingly while hanging on her left lead to reach place at the wire. CCED
FOR STEPH popped open the gate when an outer rival broke through it, but remained in place, set the pace along the inside into the turn, clung to an
advantage from a trio of bidders at the five sixteenths pole, sparred with the eventual winner through upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, but was
headed at the furlong grounds, gave way entering the final sixteenth, and was caught at the wire for place. WHAT CAN I SAY took contact from an outer
rival while breaking a step slow at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path while among foes around the turn, inched closer to bid for show entering the
lane, but was outkicked by an outer rival for that position in upper stretch, and kept on. REALITOS stalked along the inside, but failed to respond to coaxing
while yielding turning for home. ASPIRATIONAL lacked speed in the two path, trailed turning for home, shifted three wide, and failed to threaten between
horses. DORGENOIS's hind legs slipped from underneath him before bumping an inner rival soon after the start, tracked four wide, ranged up to threaten
turning for home, but floated to the six path entering the lane, failed to change leads while between horses in upper stretch, and came up empty. COPPER
MOON broke through the gate pre-race, dropped his rider while failing to escape her grasp, was remounted and reloaded without further incident, then
pressed two wide into the turn, but weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
STROBE set the pace while well in hand around the turn as an outer rival applied pressure, shook free of him on his own power entering the lane,
responded readily while roused at the three sixteenths pole, kicked away, and was ridden out before being put to wraps nearing the wire. OMAHA RED
tracked along the inside, chased the top pair from the two path around the turn, tipped three wide at the three sixteenths pole, and claimed place from an
inner faltering rival a sixteenth from home. HIGHER STANDARD pressed the eventual winner from the outside, around the turn, but swiftly failed to keep
pace entering the lane, lost place to an outer rival while fading in the final furlong, yet saved show. SURFER DUDE saved ground off of the pace, but to no
avail. COLTONATOR raced at the rear in the three path, came into the lane in the five path, and failed to make an impact.

Footnotes
JACK BOB AND LARRY broke slowly and lagged well behind into the turn, swung out to the eight path while picking up stride in upper stretch, then flew in
the final furlong with a clear BLUE CHEESE to catch, surged up to that foe nearing the wire, and prevailed at it. BLUE CHEESE broke a step slowly at the
start before being put to a bit of tight quarters among foes in the opening furlong, raced far back in the two path, shifted five wide entering the lane while
commencing a rally, swept past the leaders to draw clear at the furlong grounds, but was nailed by an outer on-charging foe at the wire. FORTY THREE
saved ground off of the pace, gained two wide and between horses to take aim on a clearing outer rival in midstretch, then chased that foe home evenly
while getting outkicked. KINGOFBROKENHEARTS chased the clear leader from the two path, bid outside of him in upper stretch, led briefly before being
outkicked by an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and yielded between foes late. WRONGWAYHIGHWAY chased in the three path, came into the lane in
the four path before being outkicked by an outer rival in upper stretch, then kept on while hanging on his left lead. TWO B tracked along the inside, shifted to
the two path turning for home, but tired while hanging on his left lead. HOME VISIT bobbled and bumped an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in the
four path, came into the lane in the five path, and made little impact. KAHAAL bumped with an outer rival at the start, sped clear soon after, showed the way
while his margin diminished nearing the lane, then was overtaken in upper stretch, caved on his left lead, and was eased through the final furlong. A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE OPENING STAGES RESULTED IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
MY LIL DUDE set the pace along the inside, vied with an outer rival around the far turn, sparred as another foe joined the fray entering the lane, dueled
tenaciously with that bidding foe through the final furlong, and narrowly prevailed. I DON'T VENMO came out at the start, tracked two wide and between
horses around the first turn, shifted out to the four path to press outside of the top pair around the far turn, bid entering the lane, dueled through midstretch,
but failed to kick away from an inner game rival in the final sixteenth, and hung. CAJUN CRAZY broke outwardly, stalked four to three wide and outside of
the top flight, vied with the pace setter while a path away from that one around the far turn, battled between horses entering the lane, but yielded to them
leaving the furlong grounds. CAJUN CONNECTION tracked along the inside, pursued from the pocket into the far turn, but faded in upper stretch. MAIN
DUDE came out a beat slow while leaning inwardly at the start, laid off of the pace along the inside, took the far turn in the four path, and failed to factor.
LIKE THIS bumped the outer part of the gate before being floated outwardly and into a rival's path at the start, pursued from midpack in the three to two
paths, but gave way. OWEN THE ICE MAN broke a step slowly before being bothered by an inner rival at the start, then got outrun.

Footnotes
ONE TIME MO nudged an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, saved ground before tipping two wide and between horses in upper stretch,
rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds while in pursuit of the clear leader, took aim on that foe soon after, bid entering the final sixteenth, and edged
ahead. AIN'T BROKE prompted the pace along the inside before allowing an outer rival to set the pace around the first turn, backed off and shifted outside
of that foe at the seven furlong pole, but got keen in the process, pressed while still pulling entering the backstretch, tossed her head rankly at the five
furlong pole, gained an advantage with three furlongs to go, drew clear turning for home, held sway through midstretch, but was caught by an outer rival in
the late stages. JUDY'S WAY stalked along the inside while a bit off of the rail, shifted course outside of the top pair entering the backstretch, chased the
clearing leader while gaining place in upper stretch, but was outkicked by an inner rival for that position at the furlong grounds. MARINA'S GOLD trailed in
the three path, improved between horses in upper stretch, and stayed on. WAYWARDNESS bumped with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the pace in
the three to four paths around the first turn, and faded. JUST PASSING THRU laid off of the pace along the inside, shifted out entering the backstretch,
searched for outer racing room at the half mile pole, then took the far turn in the four to five paths before tiring. FREE LOVE prompted the pace two wide
before clearing an inner rival nearing the backstretch, got headed by that rival at the three furlong pole, and weakened turning for home.

Footnotes
NON VIOLENCE was bumped by rivals on both sides at the start before being pinched back, tracked from the four path, ranged up in the five path entering
the lane to take aim on the clearing leader, and swept past that foe at the furlong grounds. ONE MORE LAUGH broke out and bumped a foe, set the pace in
the two path, drew clear entering the lane, but offered little resistance to NON VIOLENCE's bid in midstretch, and proved second best. CHARMONTE saved
ground off of the pace, split foes two wide in upper stretch to claim show at the furlong grounds and held that position from an outer rival late. ROSE
PALACE bumped an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide and between horses, tipped four wide entering the lane, but lacked the needed kick to bid.
BLAME THE TOLL broke a step slowly, trailed around the turn, cut the gap in midstretch while shifting four wide, and improved between horses late.
PLEASE BE KIND was bumped and crowded between horses at the start, lacked speed in the five path, came into the lane in the six path, but failed to rally.
BALI DOVE (FR) stalked along the inside, but only managed to chase in upper stretch before fading through the final furlong. TERRANOVA chased outside
of the leader and from the three path, but weakened between horses in upper stretch. SWEETASBAILY was also bumped by rivals on both sides when put
to crowded quarters at the start, and got outrun.
