ACE NINE NINE was four wide into the first turn, pulled four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn, shook clear leaving the turn and dropped to the
inside, then remained clear to prove best under left handed crop urging. TRENDING UP stalked the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn
with the winner but could not match strides with that rival while finishing willingly to the wire, second best. HASHTAG WINNING was reserved early five
wide, then advanced three wide on the far turn, came four wide into the lane and had a mild late rally but needed more, bested rest. FIRE DOWN BELOW
was allowed to settle early but lacked a solid rally. LORD WINSALOT set the pace on the inside and gave way. STRAIGHT UP GUY was settled early on
the inside and tired.

Footnotes
AMAZINGMAE stalked the early pace and made a four wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the turn and quickly drew clear by the furlong marker, then
remained clear to the wire to prove best, driving. MRS BELL was reserved early on the inside, came wide into the lane and closed well to be clearly second
best. ELEGANT TASTE was well placed on the inside, swung out four wide leaving the turn and had no kick, bested rest. RENT CONTROL dueled for the
lead on the inside and made a two wide bid nearing the quarter pole and weakened. JO AMY dueled for the lead three wide and faltered in the drive.
