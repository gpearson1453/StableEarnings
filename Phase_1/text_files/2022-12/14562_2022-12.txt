Footnotes
YES I'S A MILLER tracked pace from inside, angled out and split horses far turn in a game effort in the drive to prevail on the wire. BELLE OF ST. JOHN
went up outside to the lead, stayed clear to far turn, hooked in the stretch and outgamed to the wire while second best of the rest. SHES A THREAT was
unruly in the gate prestart, raced evenly along for show spot in the stretch run. MY ANGELICA forced out start, chased leader to quarter pole but leveled off
in the stretch run. ZAWADI bore out start, in a drive at the half with no response from the far turn. ETELKA trailed to the half and only passed one in the
stretch run. LIEUTENANT KITTY raced off rail run early on while never threatened throughout.

RIGHT NOW off tardy inside with a steady advance to far turn, rallied in earnest to be up in time while all out. REINA BELLA off rail run while never far back,
dueled far turn, cleared in the stretch run but wore down at the wire. CEE MINUS outside run to far turn, rallied into stretch for show spot. ELLIE DELI
tracked inside to far turn, angled out past the quarter pole but flattened out in the stretch run. GAMBI darted over at the start, inside run to far turn with no
late bid in the stretch. PINK ROBE quick to the front, pressed to far turn but gave way in the stretch run. ONTOTHENEXT off rail run first turn, angled to rail
while never a threat. SPUNK had an outside trip and never factored throughout. QUEEN OF CHILL rushed wide first turn but was through at the half and
galloped past wire while far back.
