SHIP THE GOODS chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, found a
hole on the rail to kick clear through and held that margin to the wire. DREAM KNIGHT stalked the pace setters on the outside through the opening quarter
of a mile, began a five wide bid coming around the turn and gained ground to the finish. GROVELAND raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the three path and gained ground steadily in late stretch. RICHIESONAROLL dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued
to battle from the three path coming around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. DROPKICK MURPHY dueled on the outside in the early going,
pressed the pace from the four path around the bend and faded in the lane. KINGFISH STEVENS raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the five path and never threatened. THREE FOLD dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to
battle from the two path around the turn and tired in the stretch. JAY BIRD trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground and made no bid.

and drew off in the final furlong. DIXIEMAGIC dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, battled from the two path around the turn, could
not go with the winner in late stretch and chased that rival home to hold second. KING SPARROW dueled on the inside up the backstretch and around the
turn, was outkicked by the winner in the stretch and kept on to the wire and missed second. BELMAR SUMMER raced off the pace between horses in the
early going, came around the turn in the two and three path and gained ground mildly in the stretch. COCO SHELL raced at the back of the pack on the
inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. OKLETSGO trailed the field up the backstretch, navigated the
turn from the three and four path and was empty from there. HONEYBUNNYBOOBOO raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around

Footnotes
OPUS FORTY TWO chased the leaders up the backstretch, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn, quickly took command and drew off in
the stretch. FREE SHOT raced off the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, began to improve position while saving ground around the
turn and continued to gain ground down the lane. ONE TOUGH DAME pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path
around the turn and kept on to the wire. PATIENCE WORTH raced in the middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, saved ground around the turn,
veered out and bumped with ROYAL DAME in upper stretch and improved position in the final furlong. ROYAL DAME raced off the pace on the inside up
the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, was bumped by PATIENCE WORTH in upper stretch and finished evenly from there. HUMOR SENSE
tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, swung wide into the stretch, steadied when PATIENCE WORTH veered
out and faded in late stretch. WHITE HOT GOLD settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path
around the turn, steadied entering the stretch and weakened in the final furlong. SONG OF AMERICA led the way on the inside through the opening quarter
of a mile, battled from the two path coming around the turn and tired in the lane. DESTINY COCO quickly dropped back to trail well behind the field coming
up the backstretch and was outrun. A STEWARDS INQUIRY AS WELL AS RIDERS OBJECTION WAS MADE INTO THE INCIDENT IN UPPER
STRETCH. THE RIDER OF HORSE FIVE, ROYAL DAME, CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST HORSE FOUR, PATIENCE WORTH. UPON REVIEW, HORSE
FOUR, PATIENCE WORTH WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR INTERFERENCE AND PLACED SEVENTH.

SUPER CHOW led the field up the backstretch, opened up while racing in the two and three path around the turn, swung wide coming off the turn, dueled in
upper stretch and dug in gamely to pull clear again while drifting out late. HANDSOME PLAYBOY raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the
opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole, dueled with the eventual winner in upper stretch and
could not go with that rival late, chasing him to the wire. DREAMING OF KONA bumped with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, recovered to chase the
leader up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on the finish. SHAQ DIESEL raced off the pace on the inside in the early going,
saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane. APOCALYPSO bumped with the horse to his outside at the start, settled in the
middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and had no kick. KNOX raced in the middle of the pack between
horses early, came around the bend in the two path and faded in the stretch. LOVE ME NOT raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the
opening quarter of a mile, angled in to save ground around the turn and offered no bid.

Footnotes
A WESTERN YARN dueled on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path coming around the second
bend and dug in gamely in the stretch to hold the win. PIKE PLACE bumped lightly with the horse to his outside at the break, recovered to duel for the lead
while saving ground around the first turn, continued to battle on the inside while racing up the backstretch and around the far turn and raced gamely in the
lane, the best of the rest. CLASSIC CREATION raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the run up
the backstretch, improved position while racing in the three path around the far turn and kept on to the wire. SUMMER BEE saved ground around the first
turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and gained ground
late from there. TUDDENHAM MILL (IRE) raced off the pace on the outside through the opening half mile, angled in to save ground around the turn and
finished evenly. WILD GUESS bumped mildly with the horse to his inside leaving the gate, raced in the three path around the first turn, stalked the pace
setter on the outside up the backstretch, came around the far turn in the two path and was outkicked in the final furlong. NOW AND LATER trailed the field
from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, made up some ground while racing in the two path around the second bend and never
threatened. E MINOR was reluctant to load, raced wide around the first turn, settled at the back of the pack from there, navigated the far turn from the two
path and was empty in the lane. SLICK EVANS saved ground around the first turn, raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save
ground around the far turn and flattened out from there. DUKE OF GLOUCESTER raced in the four path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the three and four path and faded in the stretch.
