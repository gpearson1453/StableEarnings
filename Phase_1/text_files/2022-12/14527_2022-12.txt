Footnotes

in the two path through the opening half mile, began a bid while racing in the four path around the turn, and dueled down the lane, drifting in and racing in
tight quarters, to narrowly miss. INDIAN BUZZ saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the
second bend, could not go with the top two in the stretch and kept on to the wire. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT saved ground early, trailed the field up the
backstretch, navigated the far turn from the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. BANDITOFTHEPRAIRIE hopped up mildly leaving the gate,
saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the inside, saved ground around the far turn and faded in the
stretch. SHOO SHINE led the way from the two path through the opening half mile, dueled while saving ground around the far turn and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
COX CANYON raced at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and
drew off while drifting out in the final furlong. CONRADO brushed with the horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the pack on the
inside for the run up the backstretch, moved up while saving ground around the turn and chased the winner home in the stretch. MIND FLAYER chased the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path and kept on in the lane, just missing second. DISCREET MAGIC brushed
with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to lead the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while racing in the two path around the turn
and weakened between horses in the stretch. UNXPECTED TIGER raced off the pace in the early going, saved ground around the bend and made no bid.
WHISKEY RICARDO trailed the field on the outside racing up the backstretch, dropped back further while saving ground around the turn and was never a
factor.

Footnotes
ALIZEE stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, challenged from the four path coming around the turn, kicked clear in the
stretch and drew off to the wire. PRETTY RACHEL led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn, was caught in
upper stretch and chased the winner to the finish. IDEAL BREEZE pressed the pace on the outside early, dueled from the tree path around the turn and
kept on to the wire. TRUE ATKA raced off the pace on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two and three path and finished
evenly. SHE DAZZLE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path and was outkicked
in the lane. DR. ANN raced off the pace on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. HUSH Y'ALL trailed the field up the
backstretch, raced in the two path and three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and was empty from there.

Footnotes
RISK VS REWARD chased the leader up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, challenged approaching the quarter pole, drew off down
the lane and was geared down at the wire. MONEY SONG led the way up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, could not go with the winner in the
stretch and chased that rival home, the best of the rest. GRUNDER'S CALL bumped mildly with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to stalk the
leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the two path around the turn and kept on to the finish. GRAND PLAYER raced in the
middle of the pack between horses up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path and gained ground mildly in the stretch. ROWDY JESS raced
at the back of the pack early, navigated the turn from the two path and improved position in the lane. LIL BULL raced in the middle of the pack on the
outside through the opening stages, came around the turn in the four path and was outkicked from there. EXCELLENT MARK raced in the middle of the
pack on the inside up the backstretch, continued around the turn in the two path and flattened out in the lane. TRUSTED ADVISOR bumped lightly with the
horse to his outside leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and never threatened.
WILD ENOUGH trailed the field on the inside early, saved ground around the turn and made no bid. NEGLIGENCE raced off the pace on the outside up the
backstretch, navigated the turn from the three and four path and was empty in the stretch. PRETTY DUDE raced off the pace between horses in the early
going, came around the turn in the two path and never fired. IMPERIAL BIRD raced at the back of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to
save ground around the turn and was not a factor.
