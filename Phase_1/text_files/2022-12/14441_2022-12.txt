Footnotes
KEEN LADY tracked three wide, pressed down the backstretch, assumed command at the quarter pole, drew off in upper stretch while resisting the rider's
urging to change leaders, then continued to widen under strong driving pressure. SURREY stalked while close up along the inside, chased while shifting off
of the rail nearing the lane, and kept on to gain place from an outer weakening rival leaving the furlong pole. JACKIE FLASH set the pace while remaining
multiple paths off of the rail as rivals pursued from both sides, came under coaxing with a half mile to go as the eventual winner presented outside pressure,
proved no match for that foe nearing the quarter pole, shifted out multiple paths entering the lane, and weakened. LA CHAPEAU was last away after
breaking a step slowly, then showed little.

Footnotes
THINKITASADONATION set the pace in the two path, showed the way before drawing clear entering the lane, and held sway safely under driving pressure.
TOTAL DISCRETION bumped an outer rival at the start, tracked from off of the pace along the inside, chased from just off of the rail in upper stretch, then
stayed on while hanging on his left lead through the final furlong, then split foes two wide in the late stages to reach place. LATTE DOLCE pressed the
leader from the three path, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, sustained her chase thereafter, but lost place to an inner rival late. FIBRILLATOR
chased in the three to two paths while tucking down behind the leaders turning for home, then lacked a bid while hanging on her left lead. CAVIAR
RESOLUTION tracked in the four path, but lacked a rally. ZEEROCK took a bump from an inner rival at the start, lagged behind to the turn, and was outrun
before narrowing the gap on the rest late.

Footnotes
DONYA KNOW IT stalked outside of the pace setter early on, moved to press that foe entering the turn, bid turning for home, assumed command leaving
the quarter pole, drew off under a moderate drive, and was put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. H. T. XENA laid off of of the pace four wide, then stayed
on outside of foes to reach place late. SHANIAH chased from off of the pace three wide and between horses, gained place in midstretch, but was outkicked
by an outer rival in the late stages. MA CHERIE stalked along the inside, but lacked a kick along the rail to surpass an outer rival in upper stretch, and kept
on mildly. PROUD VALENTINE pursued the leaders two wide and between horses, trailed around the turn, and made little impact. MISS G G set the pace,
showed the way from a pressing outer rival around the bend, but proved no match leaving the quarter pole, and weakened between horses in midstretch.

Footnotes
THE GRAY BLUR tracked along the inside, drifted out coming to midstretch while taking aim on the clear leader, grinded away through the final furlong as
that foe tired, bid entering the final sixteenth, and drove clear. ROCKDALE stalked inside of the leader while in the three path around the first turn, forged an
advantage at the five furlong pole, showed the way in the two path around the far turn as his outer counterpart sustained pressure, yet shook clear entering
the lane, drew off in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong, and was worn down leaving the sixteenth pole. EAST LEX leaned out at the start, raced at
the rear in the three to two paths, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly. SERMONONTHEMOUNT was brushed by rivals on
either side at the start, stalked the leader from the four to six path around the far turn, but failed to keep pace with the top pair down the backstretch,
required hard urging to keep pace around the far turn, but yielded on his left lead in upper stretch, drifted in slightly in midstretch, and was eased up through
the final sixteenth. FEELING DANGEROUS trailed in the four to three paths, and never got involved. CAP ROCK MINER set the pace while remaining in the
five path around the first turn, got headed by an inner rival with five furlongs to go, pressed that foe from the four path entering the far turn, but weakened
entering the lane, and caved.

Footnotes
GOLD PUNCH sped clear, showed the way along the inside, drifted out a few paths at the three sixteenths pole before being steered back inwardly leaving
the furlong grounds to deter a rail bidder, and held sway through the late stages. TAMBOURINE STAR was bumped by rivals on both sided while being put
to crowded quarters, smartly hustled forward for position, slipped to an inside tracking position entering the turn, then sustained a grinding charge from
between horses through midstretch, shifted in and across a rival's path inside the final sixteenth, and reached place at the wire. GEORGE ALLEN tracked in
the three path, tipped to the five path in upper stretch, stayed on to bid for place nearing the wire, but missed. GRADED VISION stalked along the inside,
changed leads at the three sixteenths pole while in pursuit of the clear yet drifting leader, attempted a bid inside of that one in midstretch, shifted course
outside of that wandering foe inside the final furlong, but drifted further than intended, and was outkicked for place by rivals on either side approaching the
wire. COFFEE COUNTY bumped an inner rival at the start before shying in the aftermath, raced far back in the two path, shifted to the four path in upper
stretch, and stayed on willingly among rivals late. BANKROLL chased two wide, failed to progress in the four path in upper stretch, then was herded
outwardly by an inner foe at the sixteenth pole, and faltered between horses. HELAIRE bumped an outer rival at the start, trailed along the inside, saved
ground, gained along the rail in midstretch, but was steadied when shut off by an outer rival in the closing stages. CUSTOM BLUE GRASS chased from
midpack two wide, but failed to sustain position while drifting to the four path entering the turn, then gave way in the six path through the lane. COURTMAN
lacked speed in the five path and between horses around the turn, and failed to factor. HARD FOUR was bumped and crowded between horses at the start,
got hung in the six path while off of the pace around the turn, came into the lane in the seven path, and faded. CHROMPTON needed rider correction to
keep from lugging out down the backstretch, faltered far back three wide entering the turn, and was done early.

Footnotes
BRON AND BROW set the pace, inched clear around the turn, opened up turning for home, held sway under moderate hand urging through midstretch, and
was wrapped up with a sixteenth to go. HOORAY AUSTIN saved ground off of the pace, improved inside of rivals turning for home, sustained his charge to
gain place at the three sixteenths pole, and stayed on to prove second best. BINDING AGREEMENT settled far back in the two path, altered course to the
seven path in upper stretch, and rallied to reach show in the final sixteenth. WISE ANCHOR chased the clear leader two wide from the outside, failed to
keep pace turning for home, lost place to an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole and tired. HALF AGAIN tracked three wide, but gave way. COACH
KENNY lacked speed in the three path, fanned to the eight path in upper stretch, but failed to factor. SCHNELL got hung five wide whilst midpack around
the turn, shifted to the nine path in upper stretch, and gave way. ZION was off slowly while rank at the start, and got outrun. NO PEDIGREE chased from
midpack four wide and between horses, but weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
VARMLANDER set the pace inside of a pressing rival while a bit off of the rail, dug in to resist a rail bidder's challenge in upper stretch, shifted in slightly and
put that foe to tight quarters leaving the furlong grounds before shaking clear nearing the final sixteenth, and held sway from her outer rallying entry-mate
late. BLAME DAY chased two wide and from behind the leading pair, shifted outside of them entering the lane, drifted to the five path while hanging on her
left lead at the quarter pole, sustained a grind before changing over nearing the furlong grounds, gained place entering the final sixteenth while taking aim
on her clear entry-mate, but was kept at bay by that rival through the late stages. WHITE CHOCOLATE stalked while close up along the inside, attempted a
bid for the lead inside of the leader in upper stretch, but steadied when put to tight quarters by that foe leaving the furlong grounds, lost place soon after,
and kept on. HUGHES CLUES laid off of the pace in the two path, inched closer in upper stretch, shifted out to the five path nearing the sixteenth pole, and
willingly split rivals to reach a minor share. MUNNDIVA tracked three wide and between horses while in the four path around the turn, got floated to the five
path by an inner foe at the quarter pole, and faded. MY AUNT SNOOKIE prompted the leader from the outside, but was outkicked by a rail bidder in upper
stretch, and yielded between horses at the furlong grounds. CORNER KICK tracked in midpack in the five path, got floated to the six path at the quarter
pole, and lacked a bid. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF raced far back two wide, and made little impact. CATHERINE BLAZE was restless in the gates awaiting the
start, then hopped at the break, and trailed throughout while outrun.

Footnotes
JUST ANOTHER WIN chased from midpack three wide, gained between horses around the turn to bid turning for home, changed leads at the three
sixteenths pole, dueled with an inner rival through the final furlong, and prevailed. SHEEZA PRIORITY set the pace along the inside, clung to an advantage
from a trio of bidders turning for home, gamely repelled a pair of them in upper stretch while hanging on her left lead, sparred with an outer bid-sustaining
rival through the final furlong, but was bested. B B GUN BULLSEYE stalked along the inside, then chased the top pair home. HOT PATOOTIE raced
forwardly two wide and between horses, checked among rivals approaching the nine sixteenths pole, steadied again at the three furlong marker, shifted
outside of the leading quartet in upper stretch, and sustained a mild grind through the late stages. MY ROYAL PRINCESS laid off of the pace four wide,
gained swiftly to bid at the five sixteenths pole, vied entering the lane, but flattened out at the quarter pole, and yielded on her left lead. BEANIE prompted
the pace two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but gave way in midstretch. SADIE'S PORT was herded outwardly by inner rivals at the start,
laid off of the pace in the three to four path around the turn, and lacked a bid. I'D BE RICH veered out to open space at the start, raced in midpack along the
inside, yet made little impact. BLESS D'SOUTH broke a step slowly before being floated out by an inner rival and steadying at the start, trailed, and never
got involved. BAD GAL RIRI raced far back in the four to five paths around the turn, came into the lane in the seven path, and was outrun.
