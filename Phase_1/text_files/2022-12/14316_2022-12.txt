Footnotes
MEG AND CLAIR tracked along the inside, shifted out entering the lane to take aim on the leader from the four to five path in upper stretch, bid leaving the
furlong grounds, led entering the final sixteenth, and narrowly held from an inner bidder to the wire. CRAFTY PRINCESS laid off of the pace along the
inside, was coaxed along in the two path nearing the far turn, then sustained a rail rally through the lane to bid in the final sixteenth, but just missed.
ALLSTAR MAGIC vied for the lead inside of a rival while remaining a bit off of the inner railing, gained an advantage with nine sixteenths to go, showed the
way before inching clear entering the lane, but met the eventual winner's outer bid soon after, got headed leaving the furlong grounds while hanging on her
left lead, and yielded between horses in the final sixteenth. KAITLYN'S COURT tracked four wide while hung in the five path around both turns, then yielded
in the six path entering the lane. STAR'S DREAM set the pace outside of a vying rival while kept in the three path by that foe, relinquished the lead
approaching the far turn, then weakened when floated to the five path entering the lane by an inner bidder. I DONT KNOW EITHER lacked speed two wide,
lagged behind around the far turn, and surpassed a tired foe. LAKE RUNNER broke out, stalked the top pair from the four path while between horses, and
weakened entering the lane.

Footnotes
KISLOVODSK pressed two wide, bid entering the turn, forged an advantage nearing the three furlong pole, but failed to clear his inner counterpart entering
the lane as that foe maintained inside position, then shifted in slightly leaving the quarter pole, brushed and put that rival to tight quarters through upper
stretch, and drew clear at the furlong grounds. BUCKY BIK COIN set the pace inside of a prompting rival to the turn, got headed with three furlongs to go,
yet sustained rail position inside of his outer counterpart entering the lane, took brushes from his outer counterpart while put to tight quarters by that foe
through upper stretch, then failed to keep pace through the final furlong. RAMMER JAMMER was prominent along the inside early on, but chased an outer
pair nearing the turn, then stayed on through the final furlong. SUMMER LOVER broke a step slowly, raced off of the pace in the two path, shifted out
entering the lane, and ran on willingly. CAT FIVE stalked two wide, chased under urging around the turn, but tired through the final furlong. CURLIN EDGES
laid off of the pace in the four path, and made little impact. NORWOOD lacked speed in the three path, but was uncomfortable between horses around the
turn, and was outrun. THE RIDER OF BUCKY BIK COIN CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF KISLOVODSK FOR INTERFERENCE IN UPPER
STRETCH; FOLLOWING THE OBJECTION, KISLOVODSK WAS DISQUALIFIED AND PLACED SECOND.

Footnotes
BOX OF PICTURES was hustled out of the gates, raced close up inside of a pair of rivals, slipped through and bid at the three furlong pole, gained an
advantage at the five sixteenths pole, shifted out to the five path entering the lane to float her outer counterparts out many paths, drove clear in upper
stretch, and inched further away through the final furlong. MAESTRIA emerged from between horses to set the pace inside of a pressing rival, but remained
a path off of the inner rival, sparred between bidders at the three furlong pole, but was headed at the five sixteenths marker, got floated to the six path
entering the lane by her inner counterpart as that foe forged an advantage, then yielded to her in upper stretch. WENDY WILECAT chased under urging
while off of the pace along the inside, and improved along the rail in the final furlong. IRONIT prompted the pace three wide, but was floated to the seven
path entering the lane, and weakened while hanging on her left lead. PAT HAND GIRL showed little.

VIM AND VIGOR pressed two wide, bid for the lead at the quarter pole, sparred with the early pace setter through midstretch while forging an advantage
leaving the furlong pole, and edged clear in the final sixteenth. CLASSIC KING settled off of the pace along the inside after a flat-footed beginning, improved
to a two wide tracking position down the backstretch, ranged up outside of the top pair around the far turn to be within striking range turning for home, but
drifted out in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, leveled off and chased the clearing leader through the late stages, yet kept on to reach place
nearing the wire. MISCHIEF'S MACHINE set the pace, dug in to resist a pair of bids with a quarter mile to go, battled with the eventual winner before getting
headed leaving the furlong grounds, then yielded to that foe, and was caught at the wire for place. DRILLING REPORT was antsy in the starting gate
awaiting the break, stalked outside of the top pair around the first turn, tucked behind them down the backstretch, pursued from the pocket around the far
turn, but lacked a bid, and gave way. HALEYS SAILOR raced at the rear two wide, and failed to factor. SILENT TAP leaned out at the start, lacked speed in
the four path, and was outrun.

PROMISE OF HOPE set the pace inside prompting foe while remaining a path off of the rail, shook free of him when let out a notch leaving the furlong
grounds, inched clear under confident urging through midstretch. RUBY FOO stalked outside of the top pair and from the four path around the turn, then
chased the clearing leader through the lane while claiming place leaving the furlong pole. IT TAKES HEART broke in and bumped a rival at the start, chased
along the inside, failed to gain under strong urging turning for home, yet sustained stride to improve along the fence in the final furlong.
THISONESFORLOVE was bounced around between a pair of rivals at the start, trailed in the three path, shifted to the vie path in upper stretch, and lacked
a bid while hanging on her left lead. MOR LIVELY took a bump from an outer rival at the start, pressed the pace setter from the three path, bid at the five
sixteenths pole, but quickly failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart entering the lane, chased through midstretch, lost place at the furlong grounds
while giving way, and weakened between horses in the late stages.

STIFF DRINK lacked speed four wide, shifted to the six path entering the lane, rallied with a grinding charge while hanging on his left lead, bid entering the
final sixteenth, and got up at the wire. CAJUN CONNECTION tracked in the two to three paths around the first turn, ranged up three wide around the far turn
to bid with a quarter mile to go, vied in upper stretch while hanging on his left lead, led leaving the furlong pole, met an outer bid in the final sixteenth while
still remaining on his wrong lead, and got caught at the wire. LIKE THIS set the pace inside of a pressing rival, dug in to resist another foe's bid nearing the
lane, clung to a margin in midstretch, but was headed inside the final furlong, and yielded late. AMERICAN DOLLARS stalked two wide before tucking
around the first turn, but came under strong urging entering the far turn, chased around that bend, then kept on while pursuing from behind the leaders in
the final sixteenth. ANDERS SMILE broke half a beat slow, recovered to press the pace three to two wide around the first turn, but was outmoved by an
outer bidder turning for home, and weakened through the lane. REGAL KINGDOM was last away, then outrun along the inside.

SUTHERLAND prompted the pace two wide, led at the three furlong pole, drove clear in upper stretch, inched further away in the final furlong, and held
sway from an outer rallying rival late. TWIRLING ROSES tracked four wide, came into the lane five wide, and rallied to reach place at the sixteenth pole.
MARITAL BLISS took a bump from an inner rival at the start, stalked in the two path, tipped outside of the top pair entering the lane, but only managed to
chase, bid for place entering the final sixteenth along with an outer rival, and was outkicked soon after. WISE ANCHOR set the pace inside of the eventual
winner, got headed with three furlongs to go, chased through upper stretch, but faltered in the final sixteenth. CONSTITUTIONAL LAW trailed two wide, and
made little impact. GRAVY HOUND stalked three wide, got floated four wide entering the lane, then yielded between horses in upper stretch. APACHE
TEARS bumped an outer rival at the start, then was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
THEBOYZGALAXY was clear in midstretch, and lasted from an outer rival. FOR REAL ALICE rallied in the final furlong to produce a late bid, but narrowly
missed. COMMERCIAL FLASH was outkicked for place in the final sixteenth. POINT OF VICTORY chased. NEW YEAR'S PARTY failed to factor. KICK N
KISS failed to threaten. GILDED APPLE made little impact. SASSY MALLORY was never involved. FOG OBSCURED THE VIEW OF ALL OF THE RACE,
EXCEPT THE FINAL SIXTEENTH.
