Footnotes
MAGICAL ANNA dueled outside with a narrow lead, repelled a challenge then edged away through the final furlong while kept to her task. BLUNT FORCE
dueled along the rail early, moved outside on the turn, loomed a stretch threat but could not get by the winner. STARSHIP BLANCA stalked the dueling
pacesetters chasing wide then went evenly late. BIG ANDY dropped back racing wide and was never a factor. MRS. CREWS raced off the pace three wide
down backstretch and faded. GLOWING STAR trailed saving ground and was never in contention. SALLY O'PRADO raced within range to the far turn then
gave way readily.

POWWA OF LOVE raced off the pace inside, moved up on the turn, bid two wide, took over turing for home, drew off and widened under urging. BOSS
CARA chased four wide early, then three wide, came three wide into the lane and rallied outside for second. ALLPAIDUP was reluctant to load, chased
three wide, raced between horses into the stretch and rallied mildly for third. SEVEN YEARS LATER bobbled at the break, set the pace on the inside,
dueled with the winner passing the quarter pole and faded. FROSTED WILD RIDE chased two wide, then inside on the turn and tired. ROMANTIC
COMEDY was steadied at the start and outrun.

OSPREY lacked speed inside, angled out rallying on the turn and was up in the final stages in a determined effort. HARD WEST bid three wide to the front
at the quarter pole, moved clear but was nailed nearing the wire. SATCHEL DE RITCHES forced the pace in the two path then inside and weakened slightly
late. GENGHIS dueled along the inside to the stretch and faltered. LONG TERM THINKING rushed to contention four wide down the backstretch then
proved empty in the stretch. JARLIAN broke alertly then dropped back wide and was no factor. PYLON flashed speed inside then was finished after a
quarter mile. DIZZY GILLESPIE broke in a complete tangle losing any chance at the start. The stewards posted an inquiry into the start of the race.

close up, went after the winner into the stretch but was no match. COUSIN BOB lacked speed outside, advanced wide on the final turn, closed strongly and
was up for the show. FIRE'S FINALE far back early, moved along the inside and finished well. RONIN WARRIOR chased very wide in midpack and lacked a
response. NIANGUA dropped far behind then passed tiring rivals. SOMEBODY saved ground within range for half a mile then gave way. TACTICAL PLAN
stalked the winner four wide down the backstretch and faltered. BOB IN OUR MIDST prompted the pace for half a mile and stopped. AWE MUN dropped
back at the start and trailed throughout.
