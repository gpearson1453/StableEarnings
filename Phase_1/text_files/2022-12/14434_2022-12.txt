and yielded to the winner late. SCATALICIOUS was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. MYREEBEN
HARBOR broke out, lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and failed to gain late. SHES A KILLA QUEEN bobbled at the start, settled off the
leaders from the inside and gradually weakened. HENRIETTA MAE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not threaten. WEST
COAST ANDY was away in good order to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole and weakened thereafter.

Footnotes
MR. STANG was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, drifted in through the closing yards and drew clear. CAPITAL
EXPENSE set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drifted out late and yielded to the winner. AXEL
STEEL chased the leaders while racing three-wide, steadied in the closing yards and lost best chance. BOTERO lacked early foot, raced three-wide through
the turn, angled out further into the stretch and finished with some late run. SMOKEN SHADOW was off slow, raced unhurried early, saved ground through
the turn and did not threaten. SMILING GOODBYE settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and failed to rally. PERFECT FANNY
raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. BODENHEIMER was off slow, rushed up to vie and weakened after
going a half. CODY'S CHOICE showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and did not reach contention. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED
AN INQUIRY CONCERING THE STEADYING OF AXEL STEEL INSIDE THE SIXTEENTH POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS CONCLUDED
THAT CAPITAL EXPENSE HAD DRIFTED OUT TO CAUSE THE INFRACTION AND WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM SECOND AND PLACED THIRD.

to the wire. DON'TPASSTHEPEPPER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the second turn, reached a striking position but
could not gain on the winner late. MISS AGGIE BLING chased the leaders while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. IF YOU WANT IT settled off
the leaders from the inside and finished evenly late. SASSY CAT broke sharply to dispute the pace while racing three-wide and gave way after going a half.
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. ALL NATIVE showed no early speed, raced
three-wide through the second turn and did not threaten. GOLD INCLUDED was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and did not

Footnotes
TAKING CHARGE DESI settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the fore with a sixteenth to run and drew clear. HIGH
GUNNER was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, angled out into the stretch, reached the leaders with a furlong to run but could not match strides
with the winner late. I'LL TAKE THE SOUP was away in good order to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the three-eighths marker and
gave way through the final furlong. BELLE MY BELLE raced off the pacesetters from the inside throughout and finished evenly in the drive. SIGNATURE
COLORS chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going a half. WHAT A WAY TO GO was off slow, lagged early, raced four-wide
through the turn, moved between foes with a furlong to run and finished with a belated bid. MINING CRYPTO chased the leaders from between foes and
weakened after going a half. FINE POINT ASSAY was void of early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a factor. MUNNINGS TALE raced off
the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and gradually weakened. UNUSUAL DANCER lacked early foot, raced six-wide through the turn and
did not threaten. C'MON LETS SWITCH showed brief speed and weakened. DOWNTOWN CUTIE was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
BOLD INTENTION was away in good order to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin into the lane and drew off with complete
authority. MIDNIGHT BABY settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and finished with good energy. HUGHIE'S HOLIDAY
chased the leaders while racing three-wide, angled out nearing the three-sixteenths pole and failed to gain late. PAYNT THE KITTY was off slow and rider
lost iron, regained stirrup soon after, raced unhurried early, moved eighth-wide through the turn and finished with a belated bid. SWEET LADY LANA was
forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed closing response. IT'S CURLIN TIME showed no early speed, saved
ground throughout and was not a factor. RATTLEME pressed the pace from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. TAM TRICKY settled off the
leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn and weakened. SHE'S NOT TO BLAME was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn, angled
out further nearing the three-sixteenths pole and did not offer a bid. MISYA GIRL raced off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and
weakened. NIP NAP was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the turn and weakened.

CLEOPATRA'S STRIKE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, gained command into the lane, opened a clear
margin and held sway to the wire. CASHANOVA settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, could not reach the winner in the
drive but finished with good energy to hold the place. BOB'S ALL IN lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn, angled out in mid-stretch and
finished evenly. ZUMURUDEE showed no early speed, saved ground through the second turn, remained inside for the drive and finished with a belated bid.
FULLBRIDLEDPHANTOM chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. UPO raced off the pacesetters early, moved
three-wide through the second turn and finished evenly. PEACE OF EKATI lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the second turn and was not a factor.
LOLLY EXPRESS was void of early speed, raced off the rail through the second turn, angled out further into the lane and did not offer a bid. MOONLITE
GRAHAM set a pressured pace from off the rail, opened a clear margin nearing the eleven-sixteenths pole and gave way after going three-quarters. FIRE
WHEN READY chased the leaders while racing five-wide and weakened after going six furlongs. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
