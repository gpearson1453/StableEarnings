Footnotes
GRAM'S GAL contested the early pace then chased through the backstretch, raced close two deep on the turn, took the nod nearing the eighth pole, drew
clear past the pole and was kept alert to widen. TOUGH ONE chased, rounded the turn in the three path, left the turn in the five path and finished well to
take second under the wire. HOLY PINK closed to a slim lead nearing the seven sixteenths pole and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the
quarter pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the turn, was met toward the head of the lane, flattened mid-stretch and was nipped from second at the
wire. AMERICAS WOMAN chased inside, rounded the turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. BALLYMENA chased, rounded the turn near the rail
then flattened leaving the eighth pole. SUPERSNAKE gave chase outside and rounded the turn about the five path. NINE MAST gave chase through the
backstretch then faded in the four path of the turn. The Stewards reviewed, then dismissed a claim of foul for alleged interference in the vicinity of the eighth
pole, against the rider of Gram's Gal, lodged by the rider of Holy Pink.

Footnotes
TOUT ENSEMBLE tapered in and raced with the pace two deep, took the lead at the nine sixteenths pole and came under pressure leaving the three
eighths, contested the edge in the two and three paths of the far turn, dueled clear in the upper stretch then widened the final sixteenth. JACCACI tapered to
the inside and set the early pace, was met at the nine sixteenths pole and gave close chase from that point, contested at a close disadvantage nearest the
rail on the far turn but dropped back past the eighth pole and settled for second. I LOVE MARIA broke a step slow then saved ground on the opening turn,
eased out leaving the half mile pole, picked up the chase from the three eighths, raced in the three path of the far turn and came along for third the final
strides. GILDED QUEST steadied lightly leaving the gate then raced inside through the first turn, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the
far turn about the four path and flattened later yards. LINDA'S TAJ stalked from the three path the first turn, picked up the chase toward the three eighths
pole, rounded the far turn near the rail then flattened in the lane. RIGHT TO ASSEMBLE rounded the opening turn in the four path, gave chase from the
three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, her rider lost his whip leaving the eighth pole and she gave way at that time. VARSITY KICKLINE

Footnotes
I'M THE MONEY MAN rated close in the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the half mile pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then dug in
under steady encouragement to take the nod in the final jump. ZIGGY STARDUST took the lead two deep into the first turn and rated the pace, came under
pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, dug in under steady stretch handling but was caught under the wire. DENIZETTI
stalked the pace in the three path, challenged at the three eighths pole and raced close off the rail on the far turn, but flattened later yards. TOBI WAN
KENOBI rounded the first turn in the six path, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn, angled to the six path
into the stretch and improved position. DE'S CASTLE had the lead in the front stretch then stalked from the five eighths pole, picked up the chase leaving
the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn and weakened in the lane. KAYLEE'S SPITFIRE rounded the first turn in the four path, picked up
the chase nearing the three eighths pole, raced in the three path of the far turn then weakened. GRUMPY'S BUDDY raced off the rail on the first turn, gave
chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the four path and weakened in the lane. WINDSOR'S STAR raced inside on the first turn, gave
chase from the seven sixteenths pole but faded in the four path of the far turn. DON'T GET CAUGHTUP became anxious in the gate, saved ground on the
opening turn and was not a factor. LITTLE ROO ROO rounded the first turn in the five path, left the turn outside and showed little response from the seven
sixteenths pole.

LATE IN THE GAME settled off the pace about the three path, left the second turn outside and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded
the far turn in the three path and dug in to take over later yards. MISSIONSNINETYNINE rated the pace inside, came under pressure when met into the
backstretch and dueled at mostly even terms, recovered the edge at the five sixteenths pole, dueled clear past the quarter but was caught flattening stride
later yards. FREEDOM RIDER stalked from the two and three paths, challenged at even terms into the backstretch, contested with a slim lead between calls
from that point but dropped back past the quarter pole and weakened in the lane. SHANGHAI CANDY settled back off the rail early on, picked up the chase
from the seven sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn in the five path then passed rivals widest. NIGHT BOSS stalked the early pace, picked up the chase
from the half mile pole but weakened off the rail on the far turn. PURPLE SHIRT clipped the heels of POLITICAL DECISION soon after the start then saved
ground and showed little response through the backstretch, while the latter had his heels clipped soon after the start then settled off the rail and was through
early.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY SQUALL was hustled to the front leaving the half mile pole and rated the pace, came under pressure at the five sixteenths pole, raced at the rail
on the turn and dug in under steady handling to hold on. EMBERLY chased through the backstretch, rounded the turn off the rail and finished well.
TIMETOGETUP chased toward the inside, angled to the six path from the mid point of the turn and finished well; outside. CEDAR'S WISH chased inside,
rounded the turn at the rail and ran evenly in the lane. ALL CAPS broke awkwardly then gave close early chase, rounded the turn in the four and five paths
and ran evenly in the lane. WINDSOR'S PLAY chased through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn and showed little in the lane. SLEWING was
shuffled back at the start and never factored. AIM'S JUBILEE chased then faded in the eight path of the turn. SHENANDOAH CAT bobbled at the break
then mostly saved ground. CHARITABLE ANY gave chase outside then weakened in the six path of the turn.

Footnotes
SULEMAN rated close off the rail, bid nearing the seven sixteenths pole and took the lead passing the five sixteenths, dueled clear midway on the far turn
and held on well with steady handling. CAIRO BOOGIE settled close inside, bid nearing the three eighths pole and raced off the rail on the far turn, then
dueled through the stretch for second. RICKYS REVENGE rated close inside, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and dueled to a brief lead at the five
sixteenths, dropped back at the rail midway on the far turn then flattened the final sixteenth. DOMINANT FACTOR rated a slim lead, was met at the nine
sixteenths pole and gave chase from that point but dropped back past the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. THATZA ALPHA stalked the
pace about the four path, closed to a brief lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole, but was caught at the three eighths and faded into the far turn.
CHESAPEAKE CHARLIE settled off the rail, picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole but flattened in the three path of the far turn. LIGHT WORK
rounded the first two turns about the six path, left the second turn outside and showed little response. CITIZEN'S FIRE saved ground. KID BOURBON
settled off the earlier pace in the three path, started a five wide bid toward the seven sixteenths pole then weakened into the far turn. CHAMPAGNE JAM
saved ground well off the pace, was taken up at the five sixteenths pole and walked off.
