the turn, moved out to two to three wide in upper stretch but was no match for the winner. BULLETSREVENGE was placed close up on the inside racing
evenly. BORK was last away spotting the field several lengths but made a late rally to improve position. WIN IN THE CITY raced in the middle of the pack in
the three path and passed tiring rivals. LOOKIN FOR LARRY vied for the lead from the two path and gave way. DOUBLE BOGEY was in the middle of the
pack in the two path and weakened. LUCKY BIG DADDY was through early. BLUE RIDGE RED hopped at the start and was never a serious threat.

rail bid going into the final turn, moved out to three wide in upper stretch and fought gamely to the wire. FUHR MEO was forwardly placed to the final turn
made a mild bid going into the stretch but was out finished. ARCTIC GUITAR was placed close up on the inside to upper stretch and weakened. SANDY'S
WAGER was allowed to settle and improved position. VANCOUVER SNOW saved ground to no avail. ZEEROCK never a factor. THURSDAY MORNING

PRIZELESS settled in mid pack early from the three path, when asked made a two wide bid on the turn and engaged leader at the eighth pole and took
command at the sixteenth pole and drew off. WILD BERT raced in the middle of the pack from the four path through the turn then made a three wide bid in
upper stretch to prove second best. SCRAPPY ARTIE was in the middle of the pack on the inside and made a rail bid in upper stretch and fought gamely to
the wire. JUSTIN SPEIGHT took a clear lead through the turn then was engaged at the eighth pole and gave way. SLITHER had an awkward start and was
not a threat. GOLD MERRITT chased the leader from the two path to the turn and tired.

THE BOSS SOSS went to a clear lead throughout and drew off in the stretch. MY LIL DUDE was placed close up in the two path, was no match for the
winner but held on to the place. RACY BILLE stalked the pace from the three path through the final turn then made a four wide rally to just miss the place.
SONYA KNOWS BETTER raced in the middle of the pack from the inside and passed tiring rival. BUCK'S GLORY was forwardly placed through the final
turn and gave way. SNAKEBIT was unhurried and improved position. TENSAS ALL OURS was not a factor. EASY EDDIE A was not a threat.
