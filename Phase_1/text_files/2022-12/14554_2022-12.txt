took over but outgamed in the late going in a good effort. FUTURE VICTORY no speed to far turn, ran late going with a late burst for show. RUNAWAY
HARRY inside speed +first turn, backed off half, stayed game late going. CHEYENNE'S COLONEL saved ground to far turn, angled out stretch, hung late
going. BIG PAPER no speed throughout, closed the gap in the stretch run no threat. HAIG POINT tardy start, raced along back to the stretch, no real threat.
SARGEANT BARGER speed between horses to the half, dueled inside to stretch, empty. SOROS bobbled start, dueled to deep stretch, stopped readily
late. CARMEL BAY bit slow at the start, never factored thereafter. AEROBALLISTIC good position off rail to the half, faded back readily.

chased leader to turn, weakened back for the show spot. LA CUMPARSITA no speed to turn, floated widest into stretch to improve late. EASY IS GOOD
trailed to the stretch, improved position while never a threat. PAPPYSAYSYES raced evenly along with no late response when needed. SHE RANUP THE
AMEX inside run while evenly to the stretch run with nothing left late. WARIS never a real menace. KAIYAS SONG reluctant to load, brief speed but could
not keep up, faded back. LUCKYWISE broke well, never menaced at any pole. EXPECT THE BOSS awkward start, no speed from inside to turn, no late
response. STORMY NILE inside run to the turn, angled out stretch with no late gain.

Footnotes
OMA THE GREAT quick to the front, well handled to set all pace, stayed well clear when needed into the stretch run. COLONEL GRACE bounced around
early, recovered with good position to far turn, rallied well to be along for place spot. OFF THE CHARTS checked early first turn, raced back to far turn,
rallied for show spot. GIRLS HOUSE off rail run through first turn, rallied along while evenly in the stretch run. SAKONNA broke tardy from the gate, lagged
back, rallied widest to improve while no real threat. SHRIMPIE secured perfect position to the stretch with no late kick when called upon in the stretch.
MILLIONDOLARMONKEY good spot to the half, lost position far turn with no response thereafter. CORTADO raced evenly with no response when called
upon. MARTIQUE MISS chased outside to far turn but used up with nothing left in the lane. MISS BRIGHTSIDE never a menace throughout. LIKE N'
EAGLE broke awkwardly and never close thereafter.
