COMMANDER FLYNN set the pace along the rail, kicked clear nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and widened while ridden out.
ST IGNACIO was bumped hard soon after the start, raced off the pace four wide, advanced five wide around the far turn, was bumped nearing the
three-sixteenths marker and ran on to gain the place. RANSEUR was off a half-step slowly, steadied off heels soon after, raced well back five wide,
advanced four wide around the far turn, lacked room nearing the quarter pole, bumped near the three-sixteenths pole, shifted further out in upper stretch
and stayed on to gain the show. MY EAGLE SOARS raced five wide in midpack and was one-paced through the lane. POKER NITE AT TOMS was bumped
between foes soon after the start, raced two and three wide and never threatened. HOLLYWOOD CLOSEUP chased the pace two wide and lacked a
closing bid. UWHARRIE was bumped between foes at the start, prompted the winner in the three path around the first turn and two wide around the far turn
then weakened through the lane. BLUE COSMO chased the pace from the rail, continued on the left lead in the lane and came up empty. ADORIAN broke
out and bumped foes at the start, chased the pace three wide between foes and retreated around the far turn. SPY TOWN was fractious in the gate, was
bumped hard between foes at the start, became keyed up and pulled his way forward four wide between foes around the first turn, bid outside down the
backstretch and faltered around the far turn.

Footnotes
SILKY WARRIOR (IRE) rated in the four path, was coaxed while swinging out to seven path entering lane, tipped outside of a drifting leading rival passing
the eighth pole, and rallied to nail that foe at the wire. DUBSTEP stalked the pace from the two path, angled out to the five path and was roused to bid
around the far turn, took the lead while drifting out to the eight path in upper stretch, started to drift back in passing the eighth pole, but was nailed by a late
surging outside rival at the wire. HOLY BERRIES bumped with an outer rival at the start, chased in the three path, was driven around the far turn and shifted
out to the six path entering the stretch, and kept on to secure show honors. DREAM OF CHANGE (IRE) bumped with an inner rival leaving the gate,
prompted the pace in the four path, was ridden from the five path into the lane, but faded. SHE'S OUTTA HERE set the pace in the three path but yielded
from said position turning into the stretch. CHALLENGE PRINCESS was unhurried along the inside but never threatened. HARDSPUN WOMAN had a slow
start and was always behind in the two and three paths.

Footnotes
ENGLISH BOB pressed the pace two wide, took over nearing the five-sixteenths pole, drew clear in upper stretch, drifted out under right-handed urging
throughout the stretch run and held clear. ADIOS PAPA CHICO hit the starting gate, veered out and bumped foes at the start, angled out nearing the turn,
advanced four wide around the turn and finished willingly outside. VANISHING INTEREST stalked the pace three wide, had aim in upper stretch but evened
out in the final furlong. ETRETAT was bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace and passed tiring rivals in the lane. GAMBLING HOLIDAY was
bumped at the start, chased the pace two wide and lacked a closing bid. DON'T ANSWER was pinched back at the break, trailed in the two path, angled out
in the stretch and improved position. FIRST PLACE G chased the pace three wide and had no response. MOONCAPTURE set the pace along the rail,
yielded to the winner near the five-sixteenths pole, continued on the left lead in the lane and retreated under minimal urging. ERSKINE raced off the pace
five wide, had no response and was eased through the lane.

Footnotes
NIKEE KAN hopped out of the gate at the start and raced prominently to the outside of SIX FEET APART in the three path, was cued to bid midway around
the turn, took the lead while in the four path in upper stretch, opened up slightly passing the eighth pole, and held sway. LIONESSOFBRITTANY stalked
along the inside, was hustled around the turn while angling out to the five path going into the stretch, and chased home the winner to finish with place
honors. SASSY BEAST tracked the pace in the four path, was ridden around the turn and swung out to the six path entering the lane, and kept on down the
center for show honors. SIX FEET APART set the pace in the two path, was coaxed when headed midway around the turn, but yielded in upper stretch.
SHE'S CLASSY bumped with an inner foe at the start, rated from the four path, tucked in to the two path around the turn, but flattened down the lane.
DANCING DOLL trailed from the rail into the turn and never threatened. THISMIGHTBETHEONE bumped with an outer foe at the start, chased in the two
path but backed up around the turn.

LOVE HER LOTS settled off the pace while racing four wide, advanced three wide around the far turn, took over nearing the eighth pole and drew off under
a drive. FISH MOONEY set the pace along the rail, dropped back inside around the turn, angled four wide in upper stretch and re-bid for the place. UNION
DOLLY pressed the pace in the four path around the first turn, bid between rivals nearing the far turn, dueled inside around that bend, battled past the
eighth pole then weakened. LAMASCO raced up close two wide while hard held, settled back down the backstretch, raced in the three path around the far
turn and churned on for a minor award. CAPSTONE GIRL was pulling in the five path rounding the first turn, took the lead nearing the three-eighths pole,
set the pace two wide around the far turn and tired in the lane. AMAZIN QUEEN raced off the pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and never
threatened. GRANDMA'S PUDDING trailed inside early, went five wide around the far turn and failed to menace. COCONUT BEACH was soundly bumped
entering the first turn, saved ground in midpack, raced in the four path around the far turn and lacked a rally. OCEAN AIR was soundly bumped entering the
first turn, chased the pace three and four wide and faded in the lane. QUARIA THUNDER was outrun while racing three and four wide. PER RULING FROM
THE FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, LOVE HER LOTS WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

furlong and held sway. JOURNEYTOTHEMOON trailed from the three path early, moved up between foes rounding the far turn, swung out to the six path
entering the lane, and rallied down the center to get up for place. DONTMESSWITHTESS set the pace in the three path, was asked from the two path
around the far turn, dug in before yielding to the eventual winner passing the eighth pole, and was caught by an oncoming outer foe late to finish with show
honors. FLYING BLACK stalked in the three path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but evened out passing the eighth pole. FRANKIE'S GIRL
rated along the inside, was hustled while tipping out to the four path going into the stretch, but was one paced. SWEET PEARL chased the pace from the
five path, was under a drive while losing ground from said position around the far turn, and was no factor. SCENIC VIEW tracked the pace from the five path
but was tired going into the lane. CURRENT SITUATION raced prominently from the four path, was asked around the far turn, but was empty at the top of
the stretch.

Footnotes
BLACK BELT stalked the pace three wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened while drifting out a bit under
right-handed urging. EXPRESSMAN had his head turned at the start then was soundly bumped soon after, advanced four wide around the turn, had aim
outside of the winner turning for home but was clearly second best in the lane. DESERT RULER had early speed inside, was wrangled back down the
backstretch, raced two wide around most of the turn, swung out near the quarter pole, bumped THE SKIPPER TOO turning for home, continued on the left
lead in the lane and gained the show. THE SKIPPER TOO lacked early speed, advanced four wide around the turn, was bumped turning for home and
flattened out. CHROME REPUBLIC raced well back in the two path, angled out in upper stretch and passed tiring rivals. LOOSE GOOSE broke out and
bumped TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE into EXPRESSMAN at the start, chased the pace two wide and faded through the lane. GLIDER prompted the pace from
the rail and retreated through the lane. TALLAHATCHIEBRIDGE was bumped between foes at the start, raced four wide and never threatened. F FIVE
bobbled at the break and never factored while racing five wide. KISSALOT set the pace in the two path and faltered in the lane.

Footnotes
BIZ BIZ BUZZ rated in the three path, was coaxed while looking for room in the six path turning into the stretch, found a gap passing the eighth pole and
rallied between rivals to win. ADIOS GARY chased in the five path, moved up around the turn and was cued to bid from the six path into the stretch, ran on
to take the lead passing the eighth pole, but was caught by a late charging foe to finish with place honors. PUTIN ONLINE raced from off the pace in the
four path, was roused from the six path around the turn, and kept on from the seven path in the stretch to secure show. BELLA FUTURE trailed along the
inside into and around the turn, angled out to the eight path for a clear stretch run, and was gaining late. TORETTO raced prominently between foes, was
short of room in the five path turning into the lane, and weaved through traffic while staying on in the final furlong. JET WINGS set the pace along the inside
but yielded going into the final furlong. EXCHANGE DAY stalked in the four path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but faded. HEALS THE
SOUL tracked along the inside but was short of room and blocked through the stretch. BIG DADDY DAVE prompted the pace in the two path, was hustled
around the turn, but gaveway from the three path in the stretch.

Footnotes
CRICKET WEST stalked the pace in the clear two wide, took over nearing the quarter pole, kicked clear in upper stretch and widened under a drive. BELLA
MIURA saved ground off the early pace, checked near the three-quarter pole, advanced three wide between foes around the far turn, angled back in in
upper stretch, angled back out leaving the eighth pole and surged between foes to gain the place late. RIA FORMOSA raced well back two wide, advanced
three wide around the far turn, rallied through the lane and was up for the show late. LOVE UNLIMITED raced in range two and three wide, moved into
second leaving the eighth pole but was outfinished for the minor awards. KATZ THAT GAL raced off the pace three and four wide, bid nearing the quarter
pole but flattened out in the final furlong. KILKENNY BELLA raced off the pace two wide, went five wide around the far turn and passed tiring rivals. STARE
IF YOU MUST trailed inside early, went two wide around the far turn and never threatened. DISCO QUEEN chased the pace two and three wide and faded
in the drive. RAIN OF BLESSING failed to menace while racing three wide. FLAT OUT COOL played no factor while racing four wide. KAREN'S REVENGE
set a clear pace inside and retreated from the quarter pole. AMORE MOON was outrun while racing two and three wide.
