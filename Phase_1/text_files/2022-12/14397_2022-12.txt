Footnotes
SIXTH ANNIVERSARY stalked three wide into the first turn, settled near the rear into the backstretch, offered an early move at the half mile marker to take
closer order to the leaders racing in between rivals, under a strong hold waited behind horses looking for running room at the five sixteenths marker, found a
seam in the four path in upper stretch, split rivals quickly to lead and was kept to the task to hold safe at the line. MISTER MESEEKS hesitated at the start
to trail the field in the early stages, was unhurried racing down the backside, began to find her best stride gaining momentum midpoint on the far turn,
angled out for clear run widest in the six path at the top of the lane and closed well through the stretch to best the rest in the end. SMART SKY pressed the
frontrunner down the backstretch, was roused to keep up to the leader on the far turn, was still in contention at the top of the lane racing four wide, levelled
out on the wrong lead in mid stretch but still had more in reserve compared to others to finish up to collect the show award. MORE GELATO was under
restraint inside travelling in the first turn, began to relax behind the frontrunning leader at the half mile pole, saved ground through the final turn and raced
evenly inside down the lane for a minor share. BIG INVESTMENT stumbled at the break, recovered quickly to lead while somewhat headstrong into the first
turn, dictated the pace down the backstretch, opened up on the field through the far turn, continued to be the leader at the eighth pole and faltered late on
the rail to be off the board. POPTHECHAMPAGNE RO had a good tracking position in the second flight outside with a half remaining, was ridden to go after
the leaders three wide in the far turn, could not close the gap to threaten when five wide entering the stretch and faded at the furlong marker.
THUNDERHEAVYRAIN tracked three wide into the first turn, was taken a hold off nearing the three quarter pole when it appeared something was amiss,
lost contact to the field with three furlongs to go, was eased into the stretch walking across the finish line.

Footnotes
SPEEDY ESSA pressed the pace two wide and between runners into the turn, dispatched the inside pacesetter and dueled inside a foe from the
three-eighths, took command a furlong out and was soon clear, lugged out a bit, just lasted under steady handling. CHERRY GARDENS broke inwardly a
bit, lacked room in behind and inside early then was allowed to settle, moved out to enter the turn two wide, continued shifting out four deep past the quarter
pole and eventual swinging six wide into upper stretch, was flying late but just missed. ASHLEE'S RING was in tight as a rival shifted in front steadying ever
so slightly on heels at the five and one-half, stalked in behind two wide into the turn, moved out four wide by the quarter pole and asked for more now within
striking distance, evened out in the stretch. MRS. C brushed with a rival at the start, tracked in behind early then moved out and advanced outside the
leading pair three to four wide, bid for the lead taking a narrow advantage at the three-eighths, dueled through upper stretch then weakened. MACHINA
settled toward the rear shifting in, saved ground early on the turn while beginning to advance and moving out three wide turning for home, gained mildly.
SERENADE BAY brushed with a rival at the start, moved forward four wide to pursue the pace, shifted in at the top of the stretch while weakening. TAKE
CHANCES bumped with a rival at the start, raced three wide on the turn, went evenly and made no bid. MERITAMEN bumped with the aforementioned foe
at the start, moved closer up the backstretch racing five wide, gradually dropped back and failed to rally. MISS MOLLY LALOU chased five to six wide and
failed to threaten. PRINCESS DIDI raced off the inside part of the track and was not a factor. SPIRIT BELLE went straight to the front and shifted in when
clear dictating terms, faced pressure into the turn, gave way soon after.

NOW IS A BREEZE bobbled at the start, had a good position on the fence watching the contesting foursome entering the turn, waited patiently inside at the
five sixteenths marker, slipped up the fence at the quarter pole, took control at the top of the lane, opened up in mid stretch and won comfortably going
away. DARK DAHLIA had a short lead five wide down the backstretch, did all the work putting away multiple inside challengers throughout the turn,
surrendered the lead to the winner at the top of the stretch and still ran on determinedly to be second best all alone at the finish. DREAMS AND SCHEMES
settled near the rear in the beginning, began to offer a run behind the front pack three furlongs from home, was nudged on for a little more at the quarter
pole, angled out five wide turning for home and closed well to capture the show money right at the wire. PROUD SPEAKER was allowed to settle down the
backside seeing the field, rallied on the rail midpoint on the turn, showed good late energy on the fence in upper stretch and just lost out in the narrow photo
for third at the finish. APRIL DE VELP engaged for the top spot inside just off the fence running on the turn, could not quicken enough racing between the
top two finishers when they turned for home and weakened in the final sixteenth. JAB pressed the issue dueling up front three wide between foes
throughout the turn, was still involved four wide with a chance for a share at the top of the lane and tired with horses on either side at the furlong marker.
ENGLISH SHIRL pressed four wide into the first turn, was the first to give way in the pace battle at the three eighths pole, had little left at the top of the
stretch and was empty running to the wire. MASON'S MUSIC settled near the rear in the beginning, could not keep up running four wide on the turn and lost
touch with the field through the stretch.

Footnotes
SUGAR IS GOLDEN rated inside just off the pacesetter racing in behind, moved out from two to four wide coming past the quarter pole, bid in upper stretch
taking the lead outside the eighth pole, drifted out under left-handed urging, was clear and just held. KERICS BEAUTY raced outside about mid-pack,
moved out from four to six wide on the turn, was bumped lightly at the top of the stretch and moved out a further path, gained steadily late but missed.
MUSKOKA SUMMER was forced out at the break, settled toward the rear racing off the inside, came out nine wide in upper stretch, was gaining late.
KNOW HOW (GB) raced up close three to four wide, ran on. SPOOKY SPICE stalked from outside, took closer order to press three to four wide into the
turn, took the lead by the quarter pole, lacked the needed late kick. SACRED DANCER tracked mid-pack inside, moved out two to three wide coming to the
quarter pole, lacked room briefly in behind runners at the top of the stretch, found room between and then finished up mildly inside rivals. UMNEYAAT was
in tight past the nine-sixteenths in behind runners, went three then five wide on the turn, ran evenly. REMEMBERING RHODA saved ground inside, altered
out at the furlong marker for room, needed more. INDIAN MUSIC broke out just a bit, set the pace racing well removed from the rail in the three path, moved
in a bit on the turn while challenged from outside rivals, came up empty. ASHBURY bobbled just slightly at the start, moved forward and chased three wide
on the turn, came out and bumped a rival turning for home, failed to rally. NORTHERN PASSAGE chased briefly from between runners, retreated. SWEET
EDITION lacked early speed, raced five to six wide on the turn and was not a factor. CHARLOTTE'S SILVER was in tight behind runners past the
nine-sixteenths, was never near enough to threaten racing off the inside throughout.

Footnotes
DRAGON'S BREW had a good spot on the rail just behind the pacesetter tracking on the turn, was patiently ridden inside waiting to pounce at the quarter
pole, split rivals in the two path when they turned for home, rallied for the lead at the sixteenths pole and was edging away at the wire. EMICRACK (CHI)
took control from the start, continued to dictate the pace comfortably on the turn, was collared by the winner at the sixteenth pole and gave way stubbornly
late nearing the finish line. DILETTANTE was headstrong early chasing the frontrunner, relaxed nicely to track the leader racing throughout the turn, was
asked to keep up and position at the top of the stretch, could not find more to threaten the top two through the lane and narrowly held for the show award.
FORESTER'S TURN stalked all alone while under a good hold at the three furlong pole, advanced around rivals midpoint on the turn and showed good late
interest outside closing well in the lane to just miss out for third place in a tight photo. LENNY K travelled in midfield three deep down the backstretch, put in
a mild run three wide with three furlongs from home, had a chance for a share of the prize in upper stretch but stalled at the furlong marker. MASTER SPY
was situated near the back of the pack entering the turn, was ridden for more at the three eighths marker, angled outside to the six path for the drive and
could not get involved in the stretch run. MR CROWLEY settled in middle of the pack between rivals at the half, lost ground to the leaders on the rail with
three furlongs from the prize and had little run to offer inside through the stretch. DOWNY BOY was unhurried at the start to trail in the beginning, had little
response when urged three wide on the turn and made little impact down the lane. WENJACK had a stalking trip near the rear on the rail down the
backside, saved ground racing on the turn and could not be a factor running to the finish line.

Footnotes
DIAMOND CRUSH was allowed to settle off the early leaders, went four then five wide on the turn coming six wide into upper stretch and launching a rally,
drifted in a bit but struck the lead outside the eighth pole, was quickly clear and held well. DE JORIA tracked inside a rival but off the fence, edged closer
through the turn, lacked room briefly past the quarter pole in behind the leader and inside a foe, moved to the rail at that juncture, bid inside nearing the
furlong marker but was only second best. SHE MAKES A POINT raced mid-pack just off the inside, was ridden along past the three-eighths, moved out from
two to five wide near the quarter pole, was gaining steadily late to get up for show. LADY BREW edged closer racing outside a foe two to three wide on the
turn, moved out four to five wide in upper stretch making a mild bid nearing the eighth pole, finished up evenly and lost third late. FOXY DIVA was unhurried
early, swung eight wide, gained too late. QUINTE ROAD was ridden along racing just off the inside heading into the turn, came out seven wide in the stretch
and kept on late to improve. TOTALLY IN CHARGE moved forward inside foes late up the backstretch, came out turning for home then tipped out a bit
further for room, steadied on heels at the eighth pole and ran on. INTO TOURING raced in the back half of the field, went two wide on the turn, finished up
with mild late interest inside rivals past the eighth pole. I'M INTO MISCHIEF stalked from outside, advanced three wide on the turn, made a mild bid in upper
stretch, was brushed and forced out and steadied nearing the furlong marker and not persevered with thereafter. SPANISH BEAUTY sped clear while in
hand, began backing up on the turn, was overtaken in upper stretch racing just off the rail, moved out a bit further approaching the eighth pole and
weakened. WELL ACTUALLY chased mid-pack going three to four wide on the turn and dropping back, faded.

Footnotes
TITO'S CALLING raced six wide into the first turn to avoid traffic, trailed while in hand down the backside, began to rally midpoint on the final turn, angled
out six wide turning for home, was full of run and drew away nicely in the end. AHA MOMENT was pushed out six wide into the first turn, settled in mid pack
down the backstretch four wide outside horses, began to circle foes five wide on the far turn, loomed in the five path at the top of the stretch and ran on well
to a solid finish considering the circumstances she had to overcome. BEDAZZLE ME tracked on the rail into the first turn, had a good spot inside behind the
pacesetter down the backstretch, waited on the fence in the final turn, finally found running room two wide at the eighth pole and determinedly between foes
ran on to capture third money late. ALEXANDROVA trailed the field in the beginning, advanced inside at the half mile marker, waited on the rail behind rivals
on the far turn, rallied up the fence at the top of the lane, shifted out four wide at the eighth pole and burst between horses late for a minor share. SMOKEN
CHLOE took command into the first turn, set the fractions down the backside, was headed outside at the quarter marker, battled gamely on the rail until the
sixteenth pole and gave way in deep stretch. GREAT KATE steadied five wide when in a tight spot entering the first turn, had good position tracking the
leader outside at the half, made an early move three furlongs from the wire to press for the lead, contended in the three path in upper stretch and tired the at
the furlong marker. VICTORIOUS TAPIT chased the leader in the two path in the early stages, was ridden between horses to keep up with the lead at the
three eighths pole, gave way two furlongs from home, was shuffled back to last turning for home and was not a factor running to the finish line. ESME was
steadied behind horses on the first turn, travelled in the middle of the pack at the half mile marker, was asked to keep pace with rivals on either side three
furlongs to go, had little response and could not get involved in the stretch.

MISS SPEEDY raced forwardly between rivals early then dueled inside a rival but off the fence as the inside runner dropped back, edged clear from that
one taking command three furlongs out, was clear into upper stretch, held while being kept to the task. OWEN'S TOUR GUIDE advanced outside five wide
on the turn, continued to gain steadily and slowly through the lane but missed. CALLE OCHO rated in behind at the back racing off the inside, shifted out
gradually through the turn while beginning to advance coming six deep into upper stretch, gained on the top pair in upper- to mid-stretch then evened out.
TRADING BAY rated in behind inside, switched outside a tiring rival entering the turn, went two wide on that bend, improved position in the stretch.
GLORIANNIA moved out seven wide turning for home, failed to rally. AUBRIETA chased four wide through the turn and failed to rally. NO WHAMMIE was
urged at the break, showed brief speed inside, dropped back and faded. HAI BOBBI moved forward outside to force the pace three wide, dueled into the
turn, came up empty.

Footnotes
ZISISIT (IRE) had a good spot tracking inside with a half mile remaining, was shuffled back while surrounded by rivals to be last at the quarter pole, found a
seam angling out five wide in upper stretch and was full of run between foes to get up at the wire in a well timed finish. INTRO was situated in midfield down
the backside between horses, was forced to start her run four wide between runners to keep position racing on the far turn, bid for the top spot at the quarter
pole, opened up on the field at the furlong marker and was caught in deep stretch just missing out on the win. MARDENE settled close to the back with four
furlongs from the finish, began to rally four wide picking up runners with three eighths from the line, loomed six wide turning for home but needed more late
to threaten the top two finishers. HIGH TREASON stumbled at the start to trail the field down the backside, was coaxed to go on five sixteenths from the
finish line, angled out widest in upper stretch in the eight path and showed good late energy to close in to garner a minor share. SHEZ A SEALY settled near
the rear down the backside, offered an early move three furlongs from the prize circling runners five wide, poked her nose briefly in front at the quarter
marker and stalled at the furlong pole. SMILES FOR DAVID was pinballed at the break, travelled in the middle of the pack between foes with a half
remaining, was ridden hard in tight surroundings on the far turn, steadied briefly two furlongs from home losing momentum and was not a factor late.
MARALINGA broke out at the start, was well in hand mid pack down the backside, advanced smartly on the fence three furlongs from the finish, shifted off a
tiring leader two wide with a quarter to go and finished evenly to the wire. ROYAL CHROME took command from the beginning, set all the fractions until the
two furlong marker when collared outside by multiple runners and backed through the field on the fence down the lane. TRILLING SONG broke inwards to
begin, chased the pacesetter into the first turn, pressed the issue with runners on either side with a half left to run, gave up the chase midpoint on the far
turn and retreated five wide at the top of the stretch. GENEVA advanced around horses six wide into the first turn to track down the backstretch, took closer
order three deep at the half mile pole, was roused midway on the far turn to keep position between competitors, could not respond and stopped seven wide
in upper stretch. BLUEBERRY FIELDS travelled near the back of the large field on the rail in the early stages, saved ground through the far turn while on
hold behind challengers, had a clear run turning for home inside and had no finish to give in the late stages of the race.

Footnotes
IL MALOCCHIO settled off the leaders racing three to four wide, advanced on the far turn still three to four wide, took the lead outside the three-sixteenths,
drew off under a drive and held safe. SILENT CAUSEWAY settled off the pace two to three wide early, came out on the far turn, was six wide past the
quarter pole, battled with a rival for the place and secured that position. STREGA moved up outside a rival stalking the pacesetter two to three wide through
the first turn, advanced to take a brief lead outside the quarter pole, was no match for the winner and lost place late. GOLDEN VISION was unhurried inside
early, swung six wide and improved position. TALK TO YA LATER was in a bit tight heading into the first turn, raced four to five wide throughout and went
evenly. SWINGING MANDY was coaxed forward and took the lead early on the first turn moving in about the two path, extended the advantage soon after
dictating terms, weakened thereafter. LADY MOONSHINE moved in from three to two wide on the first turn racing mid-division, steadied on heels slightly
entering the far turn, went two to three wide on that bend before angling six deep into upper stretch and ran on. NOVEMBER FOG stumbled at the start but
quickly recovered, saved ground on the first turn, switched out and went two to three wide on the far turn, ran on. LORENA moved clear and shifted in
leading the field to the first turn, was overtaken and settled in to track inside, came up empty.

Footnotes
TEMPEREYA set the fractions for all the race, was headed outside at the top of the lane, dug in determinedly to repel the first challenger in upper stretch
and stubbornly prevailed late to hold off the closer for the dead heat win. WHO SAYS started to advance around runners comfortably four deep at the half
mile marker, was in contention in the four path when they hit the stretch and wore down her foes in the last eighth to get up at the line to dead heat for the
victory. TARA LUNA had a good position on the rail watching the lone frontrunner down the backside, took up the chase when they hit the three furlong
pole, bid two wide at the top of the lane, fought on stubbornly with horses on either side through the stretch and gave way just a touch late to be on the
losing end of a three horse photo at the wire. AMI'S LINK began to creep closer to the leaders on the rail entering the final turn, was asked to go challenge
the frontrunners at the quarter pole inside, had a strong chance for the prize at the furlong marker three wide, lost her path in the final sixteenth which could
have been the difference in her placings in the end. TEXT ME UP was under a snug hold behind horses down the backstretch, tried to offer a rally on the far
turn but had to put on the brakes momentarily due to traffic nearing the three furlong pole and was one paced on the fence to the wire. BEQUIA was in a
good spot rating comfortably while well in hand with a half left to run, clipped heels when in tight near the three eighths marker almost unseating her rider,
recovered to loom five wide at the top of the stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. BUTTERED TOAST was unhurried in the early stages to trail the field
and could not get in touch with the field in the late stages of the race. SHANGHAI SHAMROCK chased the frontrunner for the first half, was ridden to go
after the pacesetter outside three eighths from the line, could not quicken with other runners and retreated in upper stretch. ERASMO'S GIRL was taken up
briefly nearing the three furlong marker to avoid a rival that clipped heels and could not regroup enough in time to challenge down the stretch.

Footnotes
FRESH DREAMS settled mid-pack, made a sweeping move outside five then six wide on the turn to take the lead about the quarter pole, continued past to
be clear in upper stretch, held while being kept to the task. LITTLE FIRE settled inside off the pace, came out three wide in the stretch, rallied for second.
CRUMLIN BIRD bumped a rival after the start, raced up close between foes in the second flight, went three wide on the turn dropping back, found room in
upper stretch, drifted out late and got up for show. PIERIAN was bumped after the break, raced near inside off the leaders in about the two path, advanced
past foes into upper stretch but lost place and show late. FIVE DAYS IN MAY settled at the back, swung ten wide then continued to drive out through the
stretch while gaining mildly. REIGN BY REIN stalked from outside the second flight four wide through the turn, ran on. EVER SO D'WILD settled outside
four to five wide through the turn, shifted eight deep into upper stretch and ran on. NICE COMPANY moved forward inside to press then take the lead at the
three-eighths, raced just off the rail on the turn, weakened when headed. ERRATIQUE raced toward the back early, shifted seven wide into the stretch,
needed more late. MI TORMENTA was off the pace toward the rear near inside, came out five wide for the drive, failed to threaten. LET'S HAVE FUN got
away alertly and set the early pace, was overtaken into the turn racing two to three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
RACE FOR PINKS started looping horses with a four wide run midpoint on the turn, bid six wide in upper stretch and was full of run the final eighth while
kept to the task to draw away for the victory. CHAIRMAN BOB was void of any early speed to trail the field down the backstretch, started to gain interest
picking up the bit with five sixteenths to go, angled out eight wide with run turning for home, split foes at the eighth pole and closed with a flurry finding his
best stride in the stretch. FIELDER was under a snug hold on the rail four furlongs from the finish, continued to wait inside throughout the turn, had clear run
on the fence at the quarter pole, slipped up inside at the furlong marker and just lost out holding for the place award. SPEEDY BOLT chased the pacesetter
in the early stages, was shuffled back some losing a couple of placings inside through the turn and determinedly rebid showing good late energy to get up
for a minor share. AWESOMECREST settled in midfield on the rail down the backside, angled out eight wide when they straightened out for the drive and
was gaining in the stretch but could not threaten the leaders. MARTEN RIVER led the field down the backstretch, continued to set the pace on the turn, was
collared outside with an eighth remaining and tired in deep stretch losing multiple positions. EXPLODE travelled near the back in the early stages, was
nudged along for more on the turn, could not gain on fellow rivals and showed no interest in the stretch. TALL WATER was ridden hard four wide between
horses midway on the turn while in mid pack, angled out to the nine path in upper stretch and could not get involved racing to the finish. BROWNING
ISLAND waited behind foes throughout the turn on the rail and could only find enough in the stretch to pass tired runners to the wire. BEN LOMOND stalked
near the back of the pack down the backside, put in a mild turn of foot midpoint on the turn, was widest in the ten path for the stretch drive and could not
make any impression down the lane. BIG WARDEN was in range of the leaders three wide on the outside on the turn, with a quarter to run was asked for
more run, offered no response and faltered with foes on either side at the eighth pole. GOLDMINE CAT tracked on the rail watching the frontrunner down
the backside, was roused to keep his position at the three furlong pole, could not hold onto that spot and weakened in the six path in upper stretch. TRICKY
MAGICIAN made an early move to advance between rivals four furlongs from home to chase the pacesetter on the turn, was ridden to keep position at the
quarter pole and was empty for the stretch drive stopping in the final eighth.
