Footnotes
DR. FORMAN stalked the early leaders off the inside, ranged up four wide to challenge four wide turning for home, took over, shook clear nearing the
furlong marker, responded when challenged late and just held the runner up safe late in the waning strides. NEWS BOX behind the pace while racing
outside, also came four wide into the stretch, late bid outside the winner, inching closer late to miss. COAL TRUTH last to leave, moved up then settled off
the pace and the inside, asked along midway on the turn, closer three wide turning for home, closest with a sixteenth to run, flattened out in the late going.
KEESAWAH void of early foot, angled out to be four wide exiting the turn, improved upper stretch with some mild interest, no real threat to the top three.
FOREVAMO lacked early foot, three wide through the turn, lacked a serious response through the stretch. ATRAS vied early off the inside, held a narrow
advantage late in the turn, faltered when headed by the winner entering the stretch. CRIMSON ZIP set or forced the pace for a half and stopped. GOLD
VERMILION was finished after a half, trailed home.

Footnotes
CHOCTAW ZIP broke out, was straightened and raced off the pace outside, began to advance midway on the turn, continued to advance well out in the
strip, late surge to be up in time in finishing with good late energy. WATCH THIS BIRDIE broke alertly to show the way, relinquished the advantage before a
quarter, chased that rival into the turn inside. STUCK N SNOW moved up to take command after a furlong, took over after a furlong, dueled through the turn
in the two path, gradually weakened final furlong. JIM NED lacked speed, came three to four wide exiting the turn, improved position without posing a threat.
WICKED PRINCE forwardly placed four wide backstretch, three wide through the turn while well within striking distance, came up empty for the drive.
SHAKE UP was finished early. K J'S LEGACY broke back. OUTLAW RUN hesitated at the start to spot the field several lengths, encountered traffic into the
turn, continued to trail and was not a factor through the stretch. FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

LOVE MY JIMMY broke alertly, set the pace inside, asked along into the lane, drew out steady under a continued hand ride to win ridden out. VIOLENT
GIGI forwardly placed from between horses backstretch, chased the winner into the stretch, proved no match for that one in the run to the wire, held sway
for the place. HOT PASTRAMI last to leave, void of speed, swung five wide exiting the turn, finished willingly down the middle of the strip to be gaining for
the place. DRENA'S STAR back off the pace and the inside, steered out a bit when going evenly past the furlong marker, continued one paced to the wirfe.
ACOSTA failed to menace while racing off the inside. DRILL'S LI'L MAN closest to the winner the opening quarter along the inside, gave way after a half.
OTIS OTIS OTIS tired while racing three wide.

Footnotes
BIG SUCCESS shuffled back to trail after the start, swung six wide into the lane, rallied midtrack, steered in late, bid, up final strides. BELLAMYS ROAN in
the second flight early, advanced and challenged three wide turning for home, well clear a furlong out, could not contain the winner. MAHOMEY in mid pack
off the inside, angled out four wide turning into the stretch, staged a mild rally to annex the show, not a threat to the top three. AFLEET SKY in a bit tight at
the break, within striking distance, raced outside, lacked a winning response. GOODNIGHT ARCHIE with the early pace along the inside, weakened after a
half. MARVELOUS THUNDER broke alertly, set the pace in the two path for four furlongs, faltered when headed. BUDDY REAUX void of speed, improved
position without posing a serious threat just off the inside. HOLDING PATTERN void of speed, in traffic late in the turn, picked off a couple of tiring rivals
while never a threat. DOC IRWIN last away, remained back in failing to threaten. J'S LITTLE MAN saved ground to no avail. BETTYS CASH in mid pack,
raced four wide through the turn, tired through the stretch. MO CHOCTAW faded while racing four wide.

Footnotes
SPURRIER stalked the early pace outside, three wide bid into the lane, long drive, wore rival down under firm handling. THE BOOKKEEPER lacked early
foot, swung out four wide turning for home, rallied well wide and finished willingly to be up for the place in the final jump. LARK'S MISCHIEF dueled up front
while racing off the inside, disposed of the other speed turning for home just as the winner was coming alongside, dueled with that one past the furlong
marker then gave ground grudgingly, nipped at the wire for the place. SEAS OF NORMANDY in mid pack early, came three wide out of the turn, went one
paced to the wire in failing to threaten the top three. J J'S JOKER also in mid pack early, improved a bit the middle part while four wide exiting the turn,
weakened through the lane. RUNNINGFORCASH void of speed, swung six wide into the lane, passed a couple of tiring rivals while never a threat.
COWBOY VALUES in the second flight just off the inside, had little left for the drive. JUILLIARD remained back in failing to threaten three wide. SIX WHIPS
last away, moved up a bit early, began to tire in the turn. CHICAGO'S GRAY dueled up front early inside, stopped turning for home, jugged under the wire.

Footnotes
IMPROBABLE JOURNEY broke alertly, rated in the run up the backstretch under a kind hold, shook well clear when straightened for home, steady handling
to the wire. IGNITIS lacked speed while racing outside, four wide through the turn, rallied while remaining well out in the strip to be clear for the place, no
real threat to the winner. DON'T FORGET in mid pack off the inside, worked way toward the inside by late in the turn in some traffic, finished up best of the
rest. YOU VEE CEE off the pace and the inside, came three wide into the lane, went evenly through the lane in lacking a closing punch. TAPIT'S SPIRIT
prompted the issue for a half while off the inside, came three wide for the drive, lacked a closing punch. TANGO CHARLIE forwardly placed toward the
inside early, bothered then steadied with four furlongs remaining, continued to save ground through the turn then tired a bit through the lane.
UNCAPTURED SKY went one paced throughout in lacking a closing response. TWISTED DIXIE rank, bothered rival start, failed to menace after swing out
five wide turning for home. NAMESAKE off a step slow, trailed early, was four wide exiting the turn, remained back. GEAUX YOSHKA was always outrun.
TOTALIZER was finished early. SKELLY steadied when bothered at the start, rushed up through traffic to press the winner into the turn, stopped after a half.
FRACTIONS AND FINAL ALL HAND TIMED DUE TO POWER FAILURE. ORIGINAL HAND TIMES WERE CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
FLASH OF MISCHIEF stalked the two leaders in the run up the backstretch, asked for some run midway on the turn, reached the front three wide turning for
home, drew out quickly under a single crop nearing the furlong marker, geared down late in a sharp effort. KAVOD dueled up front when racing in the two
path, continued to alternate up front through the turn, proved no match for the winner, edged clear for the place. CHATTALOT dueled up front while racing in
the three path, also proved no match for winner while between the top two into the lane, saved the show. BOLDOR made little impact with a three wide trip.
BAYTOWN BEAR bothered then was checked up at the start, trailed, four out to five wide through the turn, showed some modest interest while remaining
well out in the strip. LONG RANGE TODDY in the second flight early, fell back in some traffic a half mile out, saved ground through the turn, lacked a bid
through the lane. ONE FOR RICHIE broke in, bothered foe, race four wide most of the way, faded through the stretch.

Footnotes
WINTERS LION broke alertly, showed the way into the first turn in the two path, continued to set the pace the middle half mild, shrugged off the runner up
entering the stretch, drew well clear while being kept to task. RUNGIUS pressed the winner from the outside and in the three path early, continued to prompt
up the backstretch, crept a bit closer late in the final turn, proved no match for the winner through the lane, clearly second best. EMPIRE'S BEST settled off
the pace and the inside, four wide through first turn, three wide through the second when asked second turn, no threat to the top two through the stretch,
fully extended to hold the show. WILD SEAN off a step slow, raced back early inside, launched a middle move along the inside to be closest into the far turn,
failed to sustain that advance in the drive. BOUGIE JOE in the second flight early, had little for the drive while racing toward the inside. MILLERS RITE in
mid pack, angled out to be four wide into the lane, brushed with PARKWAY and came up empty for the stretch run. PARKWAY broke back, four wide into
and through the first turn, continued outside, four to five wide second turn, failed to rally. DELUCA off slowly, raced back and just off the inside, was never a
factor in remaining back. ROCKING ROCKET off a step slow, fell back to trail, far back, jogged in. FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
LOVELY RIDE broke on top, set an uncontested early pace, continued to rate in the run up the backstretch when still clear, asked along a bit into the lane,
steadily increased that advantage under a right handed crop to the wire. COACH closest to the winner while crossing off the inside late first turn continued to
pursue the middle half, asked for run second turn, moved slightly closer under that pressure soon after, proved no match in the drive. WILL'S SECRET
settled off the pace inside, continued to save ground through the final turn, little in the way on any late gain while holding the show. LE DA VIDA (CHI) also
settled off the pace when going evenly, three wide through the final turn, lacked a closing response when under pressure through the lane. LISETTE off a
step slow, failed to make an impact while off the inside. SEMBLE JUSTE (IRE) lacked speed outside, four wide through the final turn, had nothing for the
drive. FINAL WAS HANDTIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
MRS. BEANS never far back outside, ranged up into a challenging position through the turn when five down to four wide, put a head in front nearing the
furlong marker, drove clear. GOLDEN HORNET with the pace from the start, headed late in the turn, continued to vie into the lane, came back in stubborn
fashion to gain the place. B SUDD in mid pack while racing toward the rail, crept in closer in some traffic late in the turn, finished up with mild interest
interest to annex the show. GIVE IT EVERYTHING in the second flight inside the winner, advanced with that one to move closer through the turn then
flattened out in the drive. BANDIT POINT fell back to trail after the start, swung out to be four to five wide into the lane, closed with good energy widest while
too late. BROKEN RIB also devoid of early foot, angled five wide into the lane, improved position while also too late. AMERICAN XPERIMENT forwardly
placed while three to four wide through the turn, weakened through the stretch. AMONGST FRIENDS went one paced while racing off the inside. BEN
DIESEL broke in, raced in mid pack, four to five wide turn, failed to rally. BLAME ELI bothered, off slowly, remained back. DIAMOND CITY set or forced the
pace, stopped through the stretch.
