INCESSANT chased the early speed, rallied at the quarter pole and drew even, drew clear in the stretch, driving. SPECIAL BEACH was away alertly and
set the pace, was hooked at the quarter pole, could not match strides late with the winner but held place. AFERDITA was bumped at the start, saved ground
and finished willingly on the inside. ANNMARIA tracked four wide and went evenly late. BLAZING ZENNA was never far back, swung five in the stretch and
lacked a late response. CHARITY STRIPE showed little and trailed.
