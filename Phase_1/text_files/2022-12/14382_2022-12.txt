raced in the middle of the pack, then made a four wide bid going into the final turn but faltered. SILVER CHALICE was fractious in the gate, saved ground
throughout, made a mild bid on the final turn and weakened. OMG UR KIDDING ME was always back. TOUGH START was in the middle of the pack and
not a factor. MIDNIGHT HUNTER stalked the pace around the first turn from the two path but was through early.

forwardly placed in the three path, had to steady before the quarter pole, made a rebid from three wide move into the stretch but couldn't catch the winner
but proved second best. KING OF THE COURT raced five wide early then dropped in four wide going into the turn but gave way in the stretch. COLONEL

bid in the stretch and finished well. DANCIN WITH ANGELS vied for the lead from the two path and weakened. MISTS OF TIME was void of speed and not
a threat. GUITAR DOCTOR had the early speed from the three path and tired.

Footnotes
WISE VERDICT raced near the back around the first turn then steadily advanced down the backstretch, navigates through traffic on the final turn, slips
between horses in mid stretch while closing willingly and drew clear. VENN was steadied early before the first turn then saved ground down the backstretch,
angled out four wide at the five sixteenth pole to rally to be up for the place. MUNQAD stalked the pace from the two path, went three wide in the second
turn, engaged the leader at the sixteenth pole and was out kicked late. CITY PARK was allowed to settle to the final turn then went four wide on the final
turn for a late rally. ENTERTAINMENT was hustled to a clear lead through the final turn then was headed at the sixteenth pole and weakened.
UNFATHOMED was within striking distance in the three path to the final turn then moved three wide on the turn but failed to sustain bid.
SPEAKTOMEOFLOVE raced in the middle of the pace on the inside, made a three wide mild bid on the final turn and faltered. CUCINA was roused early to
track the leader and retreated. FAR BEYOND was not a threat. HAIL STATE saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
FISH N CHICK was hustled along from the two path then took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and was much the best. RACHIE RACH sprinted to the
early lead, was headed at the five sixteenths pole and couldn't match strides but prove second best. ENDURING PEACE tracked the leaders from four wide
to the turn and finished evenly. ZEATRICAL was bumped at the start, made a rail bid going into the turn and flattened out. TAY TAY'S BABY drifted in at the
start, raced near the back down the backstretch and made a late run on the turn to improve position. PRAYERS SAVED stumbled at the start, settled in the
middle of the pack to the turn then made a rail bid into the stretch and tired. MY SWEET SOPHIA had to check early and was never a factor.
ACHANCETOWIN broke in slightly at the start and bumped inside rivals, was forwardly placed in the three path through the turn and gave way. CHARLIE'S
PEAK was bumped at the start, settled in the middle of the pack and retreated.
