Footnotes
LEAVE IT prompt the pace from the outside of foes while racing three wide and finished strongly to edge clear under strong handling. ALLERGIC TO LOGIC
pressed Gee Etta early on, dropped back near the three past the three eighths pole, moved up again from the outside of foes in the stretch run while racing
five wide and finished well to narrowly get up for the place position. GEE ETTA showed good early foot from the inside to set a pressured pace and gave
way grudgingly in the final stages. FI FI D'ORO was off slowly, chased the pace from the inside while being coaxed along early and had no late run in a
even finish. HOT LIL MESS settled off the early pace, raced towards the inside and lacked a closing bid. NOWORRIESTODAY dropped back early on to
race off the early pace, was six to seven deep into the upper stretch and never threatened. FRACTIONS PROVIDED AND FINAL TIME CHANGED

Footnotes
I WIN LIKA GIRL showed good early foot from the outside to set the early pace along the rail and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand ride. MISS
CONTINENTAL chased the early pace from the outside of foes and was no match for the winner in the drive. MISS TRICKY INDY was coaxed along early
from the inside and weakened through the stretch run. GAS WAR was off slowly, moved up four wide near the quarter pole and flattened out in the drive.
JUSTCAUSEICAN was off a step slow, raced near the back of the pack early on, moved up two to three wide around the turn, raced five wide near the three
sixteenths pole and never was a serious factor. DROP TOP was off step slow, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and never menaced.

BRODIE BABY rated along to race in hand early, made an early bid near the five eighths pole from the inside of foes and finished well to be well clear under
a steady hand ride. IMPEACHING stalked the early pace, took aim while racing three wide to the outside of Brodie Baby but was no match in the drive.
SHORT POCKETS was allowed to settle early on, raced from the inside near the quarter pole, angled out and made a late gain to improve position.
AWESOME SUNSET was forwardly placed to lay up close early on, raced near the inside around the far turn, angled to race well off the inside in the stretch
run and weakened the final eighth of a mile. LATENITE SLEWZY was allowed to settle off the early going, moved up seven wide into the upper stretch,
shifted in through the drive and had no late rally. ZIVA DA'VID showed good early foot from the inside and tired readily. FETCHING FURY raced far back
and never threatened.

the early going, raced along the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. CHICAGO CAT was off slowly, raced four to five wide around the far turn and

CHEESE TRAY vied for the early lead from the inside and held gamely in the drive to prove best under strong handling. DELBERT TOO vied for the early
lead while racing between, raced three to four wide around the far turn, angled in the drive and kept on to the wire. ALL CHROME settled off the early going,
moved up six wide near the quarter pole from the outside of foes and moved up through the drive. ATTILIANNO was unhurried early, moved up from the
outside through the upper stretch and flattened out. JET N G raced a bit rank early, coaxed along from the back of the pack, angled widest through the
stretch run and had not enough. MCTHANKS was coaxed along while racing three wide between rivals and weakened in the drive. SUNSCREEN dropped
back early and failed to respond.
