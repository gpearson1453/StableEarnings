PRECIOUS PRIDE raced off the early pace, raced near the rail into the upper stretch and made a late gain to improve position. TURN ON ARCH was off a
step slow, settled off the early going, raced three to four wide around the far turn and raced evenly with no late run. EMOTION N DEVOTION pressed the
early pace while racing between and faded. LIL MISS CASSIE was off slowly, raced near the inside around the far turn into the stretch and never

pressure while racing from the outside of foe. LAUGH OF THE PARTY showed good early foot to the pace from the outside of foes, dug in late and just
missed in a game effort. RYDERS UP stalked the pace, raced four wide around the far turn and kept on willingly to the wire. W F IRON MAIDEN settled off
the early pace, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and raced evenly late with no closing run. EL OCHO settled off the early going, angled wide through
the upper stretch and had no late rally. EL RAFA Q dropped back early, raced six wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a bid. OJO FELIZ was
slow early on, raced three wide past the five sixteenths pole, angled six wide and never threatened. F J COLIMA pressed the pace from the inside and
