Footnotes
Through a thick fog, KID BILLY chased five then four wide just off the pace, tucked to the two path advancing on the front into the turn to knock heads with
FACTUALLY CORRECTED three furlongs from home, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, continued the duel through the length of the stretch gamely
taking narrow command a furlong out and holding it to the finish to prevail. FACTUALLY CORRECT showed the way three to four paths off the inside until
tucked inside through the turn dueling from the three-eighths through to the finish in game fashion but was ultimately bested at the end. DR. KRAFT chased
two to three wide down the backstretch and then along the inside through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper
stretch, ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors. MAKER'S CANDY chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then
three wide through the turn, went three wide into upper stretch and kept on to the finish. FOUR EYES broke out at the start bumping TUNNEL VISION and
PETROLO against pressure outside from ON THE LEDGE, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then two to three wide through the turn, went
six to seven wide for home and stayed on one paced to the wire. TUNNEL VISION bumped between foes at the start, chased two to three wide until tucked
inside through the turn, went five wide for home, made no headway. ON THE LEDGE broke in at the start bumping a pair against pressure from FOUR
EYES inside, chased along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went four wide for home and weakened. PERFECT
OUTCOME chased four to five wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, made no impact. PETROLO bumped between foes at the start, chased four
then three wide, spun just off the inside for home, tired.

Footnotes
UNION LAKE assumed a forward position proceeding along the backstretch after the field had been sent on its way, went on to vie from path as one of the
middle members of quarter during the run around the bend, challenged in earnest turning for home, forged to the front for good in midstretch, then steadily
kicked clear. ROSSA VELOCE gained the lead early, was along the inside route forced to fend off as many as three other rivals for the opening half, came
up to the quarter pole engaged in a one on one battle with the winner, gave in to that foe's pressure during the ensuing furlong, held on well to secure
second. SNICKET taken in hand to avoid contact with an incoming VIOLENT VIXEN at the break, worked out a tuck into the two path by the half mile pole,
patiently bode its time from the top of the turn to its end, cut the corner into the stretch, was along for the show. PATTY H disputed the pace from path four
as the widest of four for a half, folded. ROYAL MEGHAN saved ground until the quarter pole, was gradually maneuvered into the path four during the initial
half of the stretch run, shifted back towards path two afterwards, had no rally. VIOLENT VIXEN checked after coming in at the break, contended the pace
from path two between rivals for about a half before giving way. Dense fog obstructed viewing of the race.
