Footnotes
COUNTESS OF CAIRO tracked the leaders from the inside, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-sixteenths marker, vied with UNA PALABRA and held
that rival safe late. UNA PALABRA was bumped at the start then reserved just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn, offered a bid from
between rivals in mid-stretch, vied with the winner but could not get by that rival late. EDDIE'S ON PATROL was bumped at the break, showed no early
speed, moved five-wide through the turn, reached the leaders with a furlong to run and gave way late. WE WANT ANOTHER was away in good order to set
a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the half and gave way after going three-quarters. SWISS WHISKEY was bumped at the start, lacked early
foot, saved ground through the turn and did not threaten. ISLAND BEAUTY broke sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and weakened after
going six furlongs. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

with that rival, opened a clear lead with furlong to run and held sway to the wire. MS PARKSIDE was checked at the start, raced unhurried early, moved
six-wide through the turn and finished with a late bid. WITH THATBEINGSAID settled off the leaders from the inside, remained inside for the drive and failed
to gain late. SPEEDY GIGI pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the three-eighths marker and gave way in the drive.
RED NOON RISING showed no early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished evenly late. DYNAMIC MIMI was forwardly placed early, moved
five-wide through the turn and weakened. APART OF MY CHARM was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. LUTES
LIL GIFT chased the leaders while racing four-wide, steadied nearing the sixteenth pole and gave way.

Footnotes
NO PEOPLE pressed the pace of MANDONA from the inside, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off as a handy
winner. MANDONA set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-sixteenths pole, was no match for the winner in
the drive but clearly second best. COCORITA was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached a contending position and
finished evenly late. LADY COMMISH was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. IMPULSUS was never far
back, raced five-wide through the turn and lacked the needed rally. FULLY COMPLIANT lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and was not a
factor. BIGMONEYHUNNY raced just off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the turn and failed to menace. LIP'S OF WINE raced off the leaders
early, moved eight-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. BARBARIUS settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide through the turn and weakened.
TALKINGNONSTOP showed no early foot, saved ground through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
GOOD BYE CHARLIE was away in good order to duel for the lead with TIM'S BUDDY from the inside, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run and drew
off with complete authority. TIM'S BUDDY broke sharply to duel for the lead while racing three-wide, could not match strides with the winner but finished well
to hold the place. FASCINATED was reserved just off the leaders from the inside, moved up for a striking position but failed to gain late. KHAIKY'S
COMMAND chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way through the final furlong. DEMOCRAT settled off the leaders early, moved five-wide
through the turn and finished evenly. FIGHT ME raced off the pacesetters from the inside throughout and was not a factor. MAHI MAHI showed no early
speed, raced four-wide through the turn and did not menace. READY TO FORGIVE was void of early speed, raced six-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid. FOREVER GOLD lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and did not threaten.

Footnotes
RONALD R (IRE) was bumped at the start then allowed to settle, raced five-wide through the second turn, responded to steady urging and was up in the
closing yards. PISTOL POWER sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace, was well rated through the back-stretch, remained in control
through mid-stretch but could not resist the winner late. BOURBON TAN was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the second turn,
angled out into the stretch and finished willingly. OSTINI was bumped at the start, settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn and
finished evenly late. ROBS LUCKY SPIRIT raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second turn, angled out further in mid-stretch and
failed to menace. ITS FIVE SOMEWHERE lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the second turn, angled out further into the stretch and did not offer a
bid. CATS TOUCH was forwardly placed early, saved ground through the second turn and weakened. MONUMENTAL SEVEN pressed the pace while
racing three-wide and weakened after going three-quarters. HERBIE was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, saved ground through the second
