ACT LIKE A LADY was well placed early, rallied on the far turn and slipped through on the rail, drew clear in the stretch and remained clear late under firm
handling. FLECK was unhurried early and trailed, rallied in the stretch four wide and closed fast. GALILEO'S AFFAIR had good position throughout on the
inside and finished willingly in a good effort. UNTAPPED ENERGY pressed three wide, rallied at the quarter pole and drew close, needed more late.
SUNDRENCHED never far back, lacked a late response and went evenly. PUBLICIST set the pace for three quarters, then weakened. RIVA BELLE was
was no threat.

Footnotes
HAPPILEA was away alertly and quickly made the lead, repulsed a bid at the quarter pole, opened up in mid stretch and remained clear late under firm
handling. RIVERBOAT GAMBLER was well placed on the inside, angled out three wide in the stretch and rallied late to be gaining. LAZARUS PROJECT
was unhurried early, rallied late and closed a gap. LAUTREC had good position on the inside and had mild bid. MAKING ME CRAZY allowed to settle, failed
to menace. SAINT GOAR chased the winner until mid stretch, then tired. ASTRO JAK tracked three wide and gave way.

late response. GAIL'S DANCER was unhurried early, and was no threat. SO GO MY LUCEILLE dueled on the lead from the inside and was through after a
