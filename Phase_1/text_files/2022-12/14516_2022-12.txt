WON DAY was rushed up to take the lead from under pressure, inched away on the turn and drew off in the stretch. DEAL ME A PENNY tracked the
leaders from four to five wide on the backstretch then moved in to two to three wide on the turn and made a late rally from between rivals to prove second
best. SHEZA SALTY GAL was hustled along to press the leader early then was forwardly placed around the turn, went three wide in upper stretch but never
made a serious bid. BRAVE CITY GIRL was roused up the rail early to vie for the lead for three eighths and weakened. GLADS LOVE CAT saved ground
but was not a threat. BRIDLED UP was void of speed and not a factor. ARROGANT GIRL was placed off the pace from four wide and failed to menace.

Footnotes
DREAMER'S DISEASE went to the front to set all the pace from the inside and drew off in the stretch. LUCK OF THE DRAW tracked the leaders from three
wide down the backstretch made a bid on the turn but was no match for winner. WILD BERT saved ground through the final turn then moved out to two to
three wide in upper stretch and moved up for the show. TURN ON THE MAGIC was hard to load then hopped leaving the gate, settled in the middle of the
pack around the first turn then moved up the rail on the backstretch, made a rebid in the stretch on the rail to improve position. INTIMIDATION broke
through the gate and lost rider before the start then raced near the back around the first turn made a mild bid on the backstretch and passed tiring ones in
the drive. ENTERTAINMENT was position off the pace in the two path to the final turn and tired in upper stretch. AMERICAN CODE raced near the back but
was not a threat. MAGAWILDTIME was not involved.

Footnotes
DOUBLE TRAP was four wide into the first turn then tracked the leader down the backstretch, was coaxed at the quarter pole and engaged the leader at the
three sixteenths pole and drew clear late under heavy urging. SILVER CHALICE was rushed to a clear lead to the middle of the final turn then was headed
at the three sixteenths pole and fought gamely to the wire to prove second best. TIME TO MOVE was forwardly placed while saving ground to the final turn
then moved out three wide at the three sixteenths pole to make a late rally for the show. COLE'S SENSATION was unhurried early around the first turn then
made a middle move from three wide down the backstretch and faltered. DARK MATTER stumbled going into the first turn then settled near the back down
the backstretch but failed to menace.

and dueled to the eighth pole and drew clear in upper stretch. MEAN AMERICAN tracked the leaders from off the rail to upper stretch moved out to four
wide in upper stretch for a late run to be up for the place. A WISH FOR MADELYN had an awkward start and settled at the back around the firs turn moved
up four wide down the backstretch and around the final turn then went five wide in upper stretch to be up for the show. EMMAS RULER raced in the middle
of the pack from the inside to upper stretch made a late rally between horses in late stretch and just missed the show. CZAR'S BALLERINA broke in and
settled near the back through the final turn then moved out to four to five wide at the sixteenths pole to improve position late. CHARGED TEMP went to a
clear early lead to the first turn then was pressured down the backstretch, dueled around the final turn and gave way. BEAUTIFUL ENDING was placed off
the pace around the first turn then vied for the lead down the backstretch and led between calls, dueled around the final turn and tired. TRINITY HOPE was
near the back while racing three wide but was not a threat.

TRIPLE L'S CUTTER was rushed up to take a pressured lead to the final turn then inched away at the quarter pole and pulled away in upper stretch to
probe she was much the best. IM SINGLED UP was hustled along to press the pace from the two path to the quarter poled and proved to be the best of the
rest. MEGANS MILLIONS chased the leaders from three wide but was no match for the top two. DANCING TRICK remained back. SWEET OLIVE was
unsettled in the gate, broke alertly but was out run.
