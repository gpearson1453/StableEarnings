Footnotes
SUMMER SHANDEE rated in the four path early, was coaxed midway around the far turn and swung out to the seven path going into the lane, rallied down
the center and swept past the pacesetter inside the final sixteenth to win. PIPITO set the pace from the two path, was cued to open up from said position
turning into the lane, responded well but began to shorten stride inside the final furlong, and was caught by a late surging outer rival inside the final sixteenth
to finish with place honors. SUN VIKING was unhurried in the four path early, was ridden between rivals going into the lane, and evened out in the final
furlong for show. SILENT CHAOS chased in the five path, was ridden three wide around the far turn, tipped back out to the five path entering the lane, but
flattened. BYE BYE DAVID trailed mostly from the two path before angling out to the eight path at the top of the stretch, and was no factor. J P CORNETTA
prompted the pace along the inside early around the first turn, took back to stalk down the backstretch, but faded from the rail in upper stretch. CHARMING
CHARLIE tracked in the four path but dropped back around the far turn.

Footnotes
GHOSTLY NIGHT chased along the inside, moved up from the rail into the turn and bumped an outer SOPHIA'S STORM twice while making a bid nearing
the five sixteenths pole, opened up from the two path under rousing in upper stretch, and was much the best. PERFECT PROVISION broke out at the start,
raced prominently under a hold from the five path, loomed up to bid four wide around the turn, but was outkicked by the winner in the stretch, and was
second best. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE prompted the pace in the three path, lost ground under coaxing while floating out to the six path going into the lane,
but held on to show. PROVOCATIVA trailed along the inside going into the stretch and never threatened. SOPHIA'S STORM set the pace in the two path,
was bumped twice by an inner GHOSTLY NIGHT nearing the five sixteenths pole, and was tired turning into the lane. BULLET ON TAP rated from the six
path but never menaced.

Footnotes
J P HELLISH stalked the pace three wide, took the lead three deep nearing the five-sixteenths pole, vied outside of LINDY LYON to midstretch and drew
clear under left-handed urging. INDY LYON bumped with GLOBES at the start, raced off the pace inside, bid between foes nearing the five-sixteenths pole,
was in tight at the rail in upper stretch, angled out nearing the sixteenth pole and held second. CHESS'S DREAM settled off the pace in the two path, edged
closer three wide around the far turn and was along for the show. MIDNIGHT HURRICANE was in range while racing four wide and lacked the needed rally.
GLOBES was bumped at the start, raced three wide and never threatened. K. C. CHIEF set the pace inside, gave way near the five-sixteenths pole,
steadied near the quarter pole and retreated inside.

Footnotes
WALL STREET TRADER set an open uncontested pace in the three path, extended that advantage from the five path going into the stretch, was much the
best and clear handily. ROD TWO ROD chased in the four path, was ridden from the two path into the stretch, and kept on to get place honors. AZTEC
broke out at the start, stalked in the five path, was driven from the six path into the stretch, and evened out to finish with show honors. RED HURRICANE
was held up in the six path early but flattened out from the four path in upper stretch. KARNAK broke out at the start, trailed from the five path into the
stretch, and never threatened. DOMINICAN ICE broke outwards leaving the gate, tracked from the six path but was no menace.

Footnotes
FLIP MY ID set the pace in the two path and held sway under a drive. WALKS LIKE A LADY stalked the winner from the rail, tipped out in upper stretch and
finished willingly to narrow the gap. TIZMET raced off the pace four wide, never threatened the winner, won the show battle between foes and was vanned
off. I SAID HEY was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and was one-paced through the lane to lose third late. CUPID AUSTIN raced well
back three wide, swung widest in upper stretch and could only gain slightly. GAM GAM JOANN broke inwardly and bumped at the start, saved ground and
never threatened. FUNNY ENOUGH prompted the winner in the three path and faded in the lane. SIDNEY SUE was outrun inside. MAMA LONGLEGS was
rank at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
CLOUDY BAY was unhurried in the four path around the first turn, tipped out to the six path down the backstretch, moved up under rousing while swinging
out to the eight path going into the stretch, drifted out into the final furlong and rallied to get up in the final sixteenth. SHE'S A JOY pressed the pace from
the five path early, took the lead passing the half, was roused from the five path into the stretch, responded well but began to shorten stride inside the final
furlong, and was caught by a late surging outer foe to place. QUEEN DEYMAR brushed with an inner rival at the start, rated in the four path, was urged from
the eight path into the stretch, drifted inwards in upper stretch, and ran on for show. NAA DUDETTE tracked from three wide around the first turn, was out in
the seven path down the backstretch, shifted in to the three path entering the lane, and evened out passing the eighth pole. CLOUD STORAGE got bumped
between foes at the start, raced in midpack from the three path, was ridden from the six path into the lane, but was one paced. ELISSA JOE stalked in the
four path but was tired entering the stretch. MOONLIGHT VISION was three wide around the first turn, raced prominently from the six path down the
backstretch, but faded turning into the lane. SLENDER SLIPPER broke out and brushed an outer rival, was steadied between foes around the first turn and
into the backstretch, and never factored. KINDNESS IS FREE set the pace in the two path early, lost the lead passing the half, and dropped back early
around the far turn. REASONABLY LOVELY trailed throughout.
