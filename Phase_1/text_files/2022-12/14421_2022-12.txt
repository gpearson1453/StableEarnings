Footnotes
LINGFIELD PARK set a pressured pace on the inside, then drew away in the furlong grounds to prove best, driving. FOLE'S NOTION was settled early,
made a middle move up the inside to move into contention, then swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid but flattened out, second best. SIR
REX was four wide i9nto the first turn, then chased the pace five wide and came six wide into the drive, jumped shadow at the sixteenth marker and then
finished willingly but lacked the needed kick while besting the rest. CRISPER was reserved early, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out five wide
leaving the turn and had no rally. ZILLION was rated along the inside, then split rivals and was bumped between rivals leaving the ten sixteenths and was
three wide on the turn and weakened in the drive. TUCKERTON BAY lacked a solid rally. UNCLE YUDI was five wide into the first turn, then was six wide
on the backstretch and lacked rally. LONG TOM was void of early speed, came widest into the lane and had no response. NAZARENO chased the pace
between rivals and tired. FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY pressed the pace three to four wide and tired.

SERENE WARRIOR stalked the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, took over leaving the turn, then hung once in front but did hold on to prove
best under a drive. FOLK HERO set the pace on the inside, then was headed leaving the turn, dug in gamely in the drive and was coming back but missed.
LAUGH IT OFF tracked the pace, came four wide into the lane and finished willingly but lacked the needed kick. RAISETONEW HEIGHTS had no rally
while besting the rest. PEACHES AND SPICE had no speed and failed to menace. SPECIAL FREEDOM failed to respond.

OVER AND THUNDER set the early pace while clear off the inside, then drew off on the turn and then coasted home under a hand urging to prove much
the best. JACK GAVE BACK tracked the pace three wide, then was four wide on the turn and was no match for the winner while staying on for the place
award. PRATT was allowed to settle early, saved ground by the half mile marker and eased off the inside on the turn and lacked the needed late rally while
saving the show award. SWEEPIN HARD was reserved early, swung out six wide for the drive and had no rally. MR. AGRO was well placed on the inside
and tired. STUD PUPPY chased the pace three wide and stopped.

Footnotes
AGAINST THE ODDS tracked the pace three wide, made a four wide bid leaving the turn, took over nearing the furlong marker and drew clear to prove
best, driving. SCREEN STAR was off slow, advanced on the inside on the turn, swung out five wide leaving the turn making a bid, but could not get to the
winner, second best. CRYPT was allowed to settle on the inside, then was along for the show award. NOBLE ENDEAVOR pressed the pace and made a
three wide bid on the turn and weakened. DROSSELMOON set a pressured pace on the inside and weakened. DAYTIME LOVER chased the pace four
wide and tired. HOORAY FOR HARVEY got out badly on the turn and was not a threat while wide.
