Footnotes
HARD MISSION had a hesitant start, raced in midpack from the two path, shifted out to bid three wide around the far turn, tipped out to five path entering
the stretch, took the lead passing the eighth pole, and held on. SMOOTH MOTION stalked from the two path early, was cued to bid two wide around the far
turn, sustained that bid and dueled with the eventual winner to the wire but lost the bob to finish with place honors. PEOPLE FORCE bumped an inner rival
just after the start, recovered well to set the pace from inside, was coaxed from said position midway around the far turn, yielded to a pair of outside rivals
passing the eighth pole, and just held on to show. NIKKI NOOTS rated in the two path, was ridden along while swinging out to the four path going into the
stretch, and kept on but just missed getting up for show. GINGERSNAP JACK tracked the pace from inside but flattened down the lane. BLUE COSMO
hopped at the start and raced from wellback in the two path, floated out to the five path entering the lane, drifted in, and was no factor. SERGEANT
SINATRA prompted the early pace from the three path but gaveway turning into the stretch. IMDABESTINTHEWORLD trailed from the three path early and
was never a threat. HOLLYWOOD HERO chased from the four path but was done rounding the far turn.

Footnotes
STANDUP tracked the pace in the three path, split foes nearing the eighth pole, took over nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear. THE PREDICAMENT
dueled three wide between foes, led to the sixteenth pole and settled for the second best late. LOYAL LOUIE raced off the pace between foes, went mostly
in the three path around the turn, swung eight wide near the quarter pole and rallied widest. CLOUD PLAY raced off the pace two wide and had a mild
stretch rally. PIPITO dueled two wide between foes to midstretch then weakened. OLD TOWN ROAD hit the starting gate, chased the pace five wide,
continued on the left lead in the lane, made a bid in midstretch but tired in the final furlong. TORETTO was up close four wide between foes, angled seven
wide leaving the quarter pole and faded in the lane. SARAWAT was outrun inside. PERFECT PICTURE dueled along the rail and retreated through the
stretch. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF LOYAL LOUIE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE NEAR THE HALF-MILE
POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
ATTHECROSSROADS was prompted along from the inside, bid from said position around the turn, took the lead while floating out to the three path at the
top of the stretch, and drew clear. DEFENDED set the pace from inside, was coaxed while being floated out to the four path turning into the lane, was no
match for the winner, but held on to place. CHARLIE'S WISH pressed in the two path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, but finished evenly for
show. ALTERNATE ROCK trailed from the five path into the turn, ranged up six wide midway around the turn, tipped out to the seven path into the lane, but
was one paced. KIKILOVE was held up from the two path, had to momentarily steady going into the turn, and was no factor. OH DARLIN stalked from three
wide early, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but was tired. OLGA broke out at the start and tracked from four wide going into the turn, but was
empty at the top of the lane.

Footnotes
CLASSIC CAR WASH was up close while racing two wide, was shuffled back early on the turn, swung five wide leaving the three-eighths pole, made a
quick bid outside, angled back in near the quarter pole and drew off under left-handed urging. DREAM ON BABY dueled two wide down the backstretch,
drew clear in two path around the turn, could not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch but stayed on to hold the place. THE KHOZAN ONE raced in
range four wide, was in tight near the quarter pole, swung out soon after and lacked the needed rally. FIFTY ONE FIFTY raced well back in the five path and
passed tiring rivals. CAJUN OCCASION tracked the pace three wide, checked near the quarter pole and had no further bids. GOLDEN TALENT vied inside
down the backstretch, chased in the two path around the turn and retreated through the lane. CROWN IN CHARGE was outrun inside. EASY AS A. B. C.
was outrun while racing very wide. AN OBJECTION LODGED BY THE RIDER OF THE KHOZAN ONE AGAINST THE WINNER FOR ALLEGED
INTERFERENCE NEAR THE THREE-EIGHTHS POLE WAS NOT ALLOWED.

Footnotes
LUCKY PERIDOT was bumped between rivals and had to steady going into the first turn, rated from the four path, was roused to bid three wide turning into
the lane, and drew clear in the final furlong. BASILIA set the pace from the two path, was hustled along while cutting the corner entering the lane, yielded to
the winner but held on for place. NANA FANNY trailed from the two path early, shifted out and chased the eventual winner from the four path around the far
turn, tipped out to the seven path going into the stretch, but finished evenly for show. LOOKINLIKEAQUEEN stalked while three wide early, moved up to
press two wide down the backstretch, was ridden between rivals into the lane, but faded. ELUSIVE MOLLY chased between rivals, was driven along while
swinging out to the six path into the lane, but was no factor. PASSION PLUS stalked along the inside but gaveway around the far turn.

Footnotes
ROYAL MAHOGANY sprinted clear soon after the start, set the pace in the two path and held safe under left-handed urging. GRAND VALLEY chased the
winner in the three path, narrowed the gap through the stretch and just held off a foe for the place. BADBADBOBBY raced off the pace in the three path,
angled in near the quarter pole then surged late between the top two to just miss second. DOCTOR RON bumped with WATCH THE MUSIC at the start,
chased the pace from the rail, angled three wide near the quarter pole and lacked the needed rally. ON JET HEIR failed to menace while racing four wide.
NO MAN LEFT BEHIND played no factor while racing four wide. WATCH THE MUSIC was bumped at the start, steadied near the seven-sixteenths marker,
saved ground around the turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
ANNA'S DREAM set the pace from the two path, tucked in around the turn, opened up when cued turning into the lane, and held that advantage. ADIOS
BABY stalked from the three path, took aim from the outside of a pair of rivals turning into the stretch, hooked up with an inner rival for minor rewards in
upper stretch, and got the bob for place. GITANA bumped with an inner rival at the start, prompted the pace from the three path, was driven from the two
path into the stretch, and lost a duel with an outer rival to finish with show honors. LET'S BE HONEST bumped with an outer foe at the start, raced from
wellback in the four path, was ridden from the six path into the stretch, but finished evenly. FOXY LADY was held up in the two path, was coaxed from the
rail around the turn, floated out to the five path going into the stretch, but was tired. BION MAGIC chased in the five path but was no threat. DIVINE
ENCOUNTER rated from inside but backed up around the turn.

Footnotes
KAHIKO quickly angled to the rail, raced in range inside, advanced inside down the backstretch, tipped three wide leaving the quarter pole, moved to the
front in upper stretch, battled outside FAST AS FLIGHT and edged ahead under a drive. FAST AS FLIGHT stalked the pace two wide, took the lead near
the quarter pole, was quickly confronted by the winner in upper stretch, battled on inside of that foe but was second best late. MISS BONNIE T raced two
wide in midpack, could not quicken with the top two in the lane but stayed on well enough to gain the show. BRAMBLE BAY was bumped at the start, raced
off the pace two and three wide between foes, continued on the left lead in the lane and lacked the needed rally while still between rivals. FRIPPET chased
the pace two and three wide and was one-paced in the lane. STARSHIP NANA saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and passed tiring
rivals. POR QUE NO was sent early, set the pace in the two path around the first turn and at the rail around the far turn and gave way near the quarter pole.
STARSHIP NTERPRISE was outrun inside. GOOD FIGHT was bumped at the start, raced off the pace two and three wide and never threatened. OCEAN
SAFARI failed to menace while racing three and four wide. EMPRESS ELLIE played no factor while racing two and three wide.

Footnotes
MARIA'S HONOR broke out and bumped an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace from the three path, took over the lead around the far turn, was cued
to open up from the two path entering the lane, and went clear. BELLA MIURA rated from the two path early, was shuffled back while looking for room
heading into the far turn, was roused while shifting out to the eight path in upper stretch, and rallied down the center to get up for place. KILKENNY BELLA
stalked while three wide, took aim from the four path entering the lane, and kept on for show. RIA FORMOSA raced in midpack while four wide early, floated
out to the six path while under urging entering the stretch, but evened out late. FLAT OUT COOL trailed from the three path to the half mile marker, moved
up between rivals when coaxed around the far turn, but finished evenly in the stretch. STARE IF YOU MUST was held up while five wide around the first
turn, was driven from the six path into the lane, but was one paced. AMORE MOON chased from inside, was ridden from the three path into the stretch, but
flattened. DISCO QUEEN was bumped by an inner foe and had to steady going into the first turn, cut the corner around the far turn into the lane, but was no
factor. SWEET BRODY was bumped by an inner foe and squeezed at the start, raced from off the pace in the four path but was no threat. RANSOMS
REWARD set the pace from the two path but gaveway turning into the stretch. HOLIDAY PRINCESS tracked between rivals early but was empty at the top
of the lane.
