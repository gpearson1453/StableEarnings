HERE'S PERFECTION tracked the leader for a half along the inside, eased out and split foes nearing the furlong grounds, clear, held the next two safe late
under firm handling. THE X FACTOR last away, moved out, pressed outside, between foes into the lane, fell back a bit in upper stretch, set down, finished
willingly to be getting to the winner, proved game for second. KEEN CONTENDER trailed early while well off the inside, closer three wide through the turn,
also lost a bit of ground into the lane, widest to the wire, also closed some ground on the winner late while being outkicked for the second spot. ROWDY
DAISY broke well from the outside, cleared to the rail before a furlong, faltered when confronted in upper stretch. DOOZY BATZ moved out a bit after the
start, inched a bit closer into the turn, gave way from between horses and was eased through the stretch.

Footnotes
DARK TIMBER broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in hand, continued to rate kindly through the turn, remained clear down the stretch under a
moderate hand ride to win ridden out. ST ANDREWS in the second flight early, moved closer when knifing between horses late in the turn, could do little
with the winner through the stretch, clearly second best. HANKS lacked speed inside early, advanced in the two path late in the turn, continued with mild
interest to be along for the show. OTTOMAN EMPIRE closest to the winner in the two path up the back stretch, continued to pursue that one through the
turn then weakened in the drive. RUM 'N TONIC within striking distance while three wide, came up empty for the stretch run. HAPPY BOY ROCKET broke
slowly, moved off the inside, three wide into the lane, lacked a closing kick. DRIFTER in mid pack along the inside, moved out three wide for the turn, also
found lacking through the lane. PENETRATOR bumped at the start, raced back off the pace and the inside, four wide into the lane, failed to rally as well. D
T'S DREAM broke out, bothered rivals, raced forwardly, retreated. JIM AND JIM off a step slow, failed to menace. TOUCH CODE broke slowly, was never
close. ZAP MOTION pinched, off slowly, was finished after a half.

Footnotes
COLOSI settled off the pace along the inside, inched closer far turn, steadied in traffic soon after, dropped inside, steered back out when straightened for
home, wore down leader to be edging clear at the wire. LEADER OF MEN broke alertly, set the pace along the inside, continued to show the way into the
lane, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, remained clear for the second spot. FLATOUT WINNER pressed the runner up off the inside, remained closest
to that one through the second turn, finished up best of the rest. FREDONIAN within striking distance while racing three wide, had little left for the drive.
FLOWERS FOR LISA outrun into the first turn while four wide, angled in a bit to save some ground onto the backstretch, remained in the two path through
the second bend, lacked a rally. EAGLE PASS made little impact while racing three wide.

Footnotes
SINNER'S SIN dueled up the backstretch on the outside, put a head in front late in turn, put his early rival away soon after just as he was being joined by
the runner up entering the stretch, brushed past the furlong marker, found more late to be edging away late under a solid effort. TOWN BRANCH in the
second flight early outside, three wide through the turn, ranged up outside the winner turning for home, dueled, brushed with that one midstretch, outkicked
in the late going, clearly second best. ATLANTIC DANCER floated out break, devoid of early foot in falling back to trail, angled out three wide late in the
bend, showed some belated interest down the lane to be up late for the show. EV'S SHERMAN in mid pack off the inside, came four wide for the drive when
making a mild gain, closest to the top two with a furlong to run, nipped late for the show. UNSTABLE PRINCE lacked speed off the inside, three wide turning
for home, in traffic, in tight midstretch, improved slightly when clear. PATROLMAN saved ground to no avail. WITHOUT A SONG dueled up front along the
inside, faltered entering the stretch. FAST LANE came out just after the start, raced in mid pack up the backstretch toward the inside, faded through the
stretch.

Footnotes
DRIVEN ONE broke on top, set the pace inside, shrugged off his nearest pursuer by late in the final turn, drew out through the stretch under steady right
handed encouragement. WARTIME HERO never far back off the inside, came three wide out of the final turn, chased the winner in vain past the furlong
marker to prove no match, remained clear for the place. PRIMER DIMER closest to the winner off the inside, continued to pressure that one up the
backstretch, lodged a brief bid far turn, could not sustain that advance stretch, finished up best of the rest. RYE HUMOR lacked speed off the inside, came
three wide for the drive when put to pressure, failed to muster any late gain to finish up evenly. OPTIMUS KAT in mid pack while racing out in the strip,
floated out four wide into the lane, also went one paced to the wire in lacking a closing punch. EGOMANIAC void of speed, remained back while toward the
inside into the far turn, lacked room and steadied late in that bend,improved a bit when clear for the drive, no real threat. TANGO KILO shuffled back to trail
just after the start,continued back the middle half while saving ground, moved out picked off some tiring rivals down the stretch while not a serious threat.
GEORGIA DEPUTY came out slightly to help tighten up TANGO KILO, raced three wide much of the way in a nonthreatening trip. ARRIVAL dropped inside
to save ground first turn, moved a bit closer with a mild middle move before a half then began to tire late in the final turn. CASH ROCKET in the second
flight early inside, gave way through the stretch. BELIEVEINHOLIDAYS came in early to held tighten up TANGO KILO, raced four wide through the turns,
backed up and was well beaten. ONE MILE FRACTIONAL SPLIT HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

HIT SHOW unhurried early outside, four wide when advancing second turn, dueled into and through upper stretch, kicked clear the final furlong.
INVULNERABLE carried out start, straightened to set the pace, briefly raced on equal terms with the winner upper stretch, proved no match late while
holding sway for the place. PROTEGE broke in to help force back RECKER POING, straightened to press the runner up, had little for that one or the winner
through the lane, comfortably saved the show. DAY TRADE broke out, lacked speed while saving ground early, steered out three wide turning for home,
went evenly through the stretch. GIROOVIN broke out to help force back RECKER POINT, mid pack, closer just before a half, stopped when in tight then
checked up three furlongs out, fell back to lose all chance. RECKER POINT forced back start, trailed well back, never a factor. WRITTEN DANCE forwardly
placed while racing three wide, gave way suddenly far turn, eased stretch, walked off. HAND-TIMED FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
PRETTY BIRDIE broke alertly, showed the way up the backstretch in hand, continued to rate on the engine through the turn, extended advantage when
straightened for home, maintained daylight late under steady handling. SARAH HARPER in the second flight off the inside, raced three wide through the
turn, slowly getting to the winner while well out in the strip, clearly second best. CARRIBEAN CAPER behind the pace just off the inside, continued in the
two path late in the turn, in some traffic soon after, modest late interest to be up for the show late. I'M THE BOSS OF ME prompted the winner from the
outside for three furlongs, fell back a in upper stretch, finished up evenly. ARI OAKLEY behind the second flight along the inside, continued behind the
winner turning for home then also was found lacking in the late going. NOVEL SQUALL off a bit slow, made little impact while racing toward the inside. RED
HOT MESS also off slowly, remained back throughoiut. QUICK MUNNY finished early, trailed home.

Footnotes
DISC JOCKEY took control after the start, angled toward the inside, rated in the run up the backstretch, continued to show the way in the two path into the
lane while responding when challenged by the runner up, headed by that one in upper stretch, battled back and was edging away late. WINTERWOOD
allowed the pace to go early while three wide, continued to settle in the three path, advanced into contention late second turn, challenged into the lane, put a
head in front nearing midstretch, outgamed the final sixteenth. BARBER ROAD lacked speed inside, moved out, steered out a bit while asking for run three
wide late in the final turn, proved no match for the top two. MALIBU S S broke alertly, raced within striking distance while inside, continued to save ground,
came up empty for the drive. U S NAVY CROSS broke out, lacked speed inside, was never a threat. STORMY PATTERN pressed the issue from the
outside for five furlongs, retreated in the run to the wire. CATDADDY bothered to be away slowly, trailed throughout and was never a factor. HAND-TIMED
FINAL TIME CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
BAL HARBOUR broke on top, set the pace in the two path early, saved some ground through the second turn, asked along into the stretch, clear, drifted a
bit a sixteenth out, held the runner up safe late under firm handling. LAST SAMURAI off a bit slow, settled mid pack, asked along far turn, angled three wide
into the lane, steadily gaining on the winner late. SCARLET FUSION four wide in the first turn when off the pace, continued outside, four to five wide second
bend, mild interest to be up late for the show. RUN CLASSIC pressured the winner to that one's outside, moved a bit closer second turn, weakened through
the stretch, caught late for the show. KING FURY lacked speed while outside, failed to respond in the drive. LOGICAL MYTH forwardly placed outrun
outside, four wide first turn, again late in the second turn when asked for run, gave way in the drive. SILVER DUST restless in the gate prior to the start,
broke in the air, moved up, rank into the first turn, again before a half, stopped. FINAL WAS HAND TIMED DUE TO TIMER MALFUNCTION.

Footnotes
SULWE lacked early foot well wide, raced four to five wide turn, late surge while remaining well wide through the lane, up in the final jump. ONE WAY OR
ANOTHER broke toward the front, 2nd flight outside, took over in the three path turning for home, shook well clear but could not contain the winner to be
nailed in the very late going. CHAI TEA lacked early foot, remained unhurried early turn, steered toward the inside for the drive, rallied up the rail to be clear
for the show. TAPIT RIGHT in tight start, steadily advanced through the turn while angling out three wide, roused in upper stretch, flattened out in the late
going to finish up evenly. CHOCTAW CHARLIE lacked speed just off the inside, dropped inside when advancing late in the turn, also flattened out in the
final furlong to lose a couple of positions. RUN FEARLESS lacked speed in the two path, steered out for room stretch, improved position.
TWENTYTWENTYREDO broke back, continued to be devoid of speed, steered out very wide when straightened for home, improved position. LIGHTNING
HART narrowly set a lively pace along the inside, faltered when headed entering the stretch. MOCHA KISS settled in mid pack, came four wide for the drive,
had little for the run to the wire. WICKED STREET in the second flight, three wide exiting the turn, tired. WAR MUSIC dwelt at the start to spot the field
several lengths, far back, never a factor. DERBY DAY LASSIE slipped while breaking to the outside to bother TAPIT RIGHT, pressed the pace for a half and
stopped. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
