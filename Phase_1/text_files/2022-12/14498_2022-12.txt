Footnotes
TRY TO CAPTURE was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, reached the fore inside the furlong marker and drew off with
complete authority. ABRAAJ MIRAGE lacked early speed, saved ground through the turn and finished with good energy. NEW EVERY MORNING broke
sharply to press the pace while racing three-wide and gave way in the drive. LAST RENEGADE showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn
and found his best stride late. KIND OF GALLANT was away in good order to dispute the pace from the inside, opened a clear margin nearing the
five-sixteenths pole and weakened through the final furlong. MINDSHARE broke in the air, raced six-wide through the turn and did not reach contention.

Footnotes
SONNY SMACK was bumped at the break then reserved just off the leaders early, angled out into the stretch and was up in the closing yards. TARTINI
pressed the pace while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter, opened a clear margin with a furlong to run but could not hold the
winner safe late. MY INDY was bumped at the break, showed no early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn and finished with good late energy.
STITZY broke sharply to set a pressured pace from the inside, steadied nearing the three-sixteenths pole, angled out and gave way in the drive. AX MAN
was forwardly placed early, moved three-wide through the second turn and weakened. COURAGEOUS lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the
second turn and failed to rally. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY AND THE RIDER OF STIZY LODGED AN OBJECTION AGAINST SONNY
SMACK CONCERING THE STEADYIING OF STIZY AT THE THREE-SIXTEENTHS POLE AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO CHANGE.
THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
HAPI HAPI raced four-wide through the first turn, was carried out and bumped by PAINT ME LUCKY nearing the quarter, exchanged bumps with that rival
through the stretch and was up in the closing yards. PAINT ME LUCKY sprinted clear at once, was well rated through the back-stretch, drifted out to bump
the winner nearing the quarter, exchanged bumps through the stretch and could not hold the that rival safe late. CLUB MESQUITE was forwardly placed
early, moved three-wide through the second turn and failed to gain in the drive. WE'RE JUST SAYIN raced five-wide through both turns, settled off the
leaders early, angled in with a furlong to run and did not threaten. BLAME IT ON KITTY showed no early speed, raced four-wide through the second turn
and was not a factor. HYDROGEN was away in good order to chase the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going three furlongs. HEY
SEQUOIA was void of early foot, raced off the rail through the second turn and did not menace. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AND INQUIRY
CONCERNINIG THE BUMPING THROUGH THE STRETCH OF HAPI HAPI AND PAINT ME LUCKY AND AFTER REVIEWING THE FILMS MADE NO

Footnotes
ROWANGOESHOLLYWOOD sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and drew off with complete authority. FEARLESS FACTOR
was reserved just off the leaders early, saved ground through the turn, angled out approaching the stretch and failed to gain on the winner in the drive.
METAROSE chased the leaders while racing four-wide throughout and lacked the needed closing response. LADY JADE settled off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn, angled out nearing the quarter and finished evenly. KID CAT was void of early speed, raced three-wide through the turn
and was not a factor. WORKIN NINETOFIVE raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the turn, angled out further nearing the quarter and
did not threaten. WAHASHA showed no early speed, raced off the rail through the turn and did not menace. JAZZY EINSTEIN lacked early speed, raced
three-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. KEEPINMYPROMISE chased the leaders while racing four-wide and weakened after going a half.

SHORT RIB pressed the pace while racing four-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-eighths marker, opened a clear margin nearing the
quarter and drew off through the lane while being ridden out. SILENT DECLARATION pressed the pace from the inside, angled out nearing the quarter, was
no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. ROMEO'S GLORY settled off the leaders from the inside and finished evenly late. DOUBLE
THE GOLD was forwardly placed early, moved five-wide through the turn and finished evenly late. SYZSLAK was void of early speed, raced off the rail
through the turn and was not a factor. MORE ACTION lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. JUST PICK IT UP set a
pressured pace from between foes, steadied nearing the three-eighths pole and weakened. LAZARUS COME FORTH raced just off the leaders early,
moved three-wide through the turn and weakened. RI' PIN SNAP checked soon after the start, lagged early, raced three-wide through the turn and did not
offer a bid.

Footnotes
VERY SCARY bobbled at the start, dueled for the lead while racing three-wide, opened a clear margin nearing the five-eighths pole and was ridden out to
the wire. BARBIE WARS hopped at the start and was bumped, lacked early speed, raced five-wide through the second turn, could not gain on the winner in
the drive but finished well to gain the place. GOLDEN SUN DROPS pressed the pace while racing four-wide, stayed on well in the drive and gave way.
PRINCESS OF MALIBU settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the second turn, reached a contending position and failed to gain late. REAL
GOOD VYBZ checked after the opening quartet, raced just off the leaders from the inside throughout and lacked the needed closing response. FIRST
IMPRESSION settled off the leaders early, moved three-wide through the second turn, offered a bid nearing the quarter and weakened. KEEPMEINPOWER
lacked early foot, raced eight-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. TED'S CANDY GIRL was void of early speed, saved ground through the
second turn and did not offer a bid. IMPECCABLE TASTE was bumped at the break, raced five-wide through the first turn, showed no early foot, raced
three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. FLY ROBYN FLY was away in good order to duel for the lead from the inside, weakened after the
opening quarter and was eased through the lane. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
