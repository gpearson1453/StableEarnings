Footnotes
DULCE AMBICION had a slow start and trailed from the two path around the first turn, shifted out down the backstretch, moved up while five wide around
the far turn, tipped out to the seven path going into the stretch, bid for the lead in the final furlong, and drew clear. BLACK ICE stalked between rivals,
shifted out around the far turn, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and chased home the winner to place. NAA DUDETTE raced from wellback in
the two path, was coaxed through an opening along the inside turning into the lane, and kept on in the stretch for show. BREAKING BULLET led from the
two path, opened up when roused turning into the stretch, but yielded in the final furlong. DIXIE GROOVE prompted the pace from the four path but backed
up around the far turn. GO MIKA pressed the pace from two wide, was bumped by an inner foe and had to checkout of it inside the final furlong, and
flattened. IRON LOTUS chased from inside, was driven between rivals into the stretch, drifted out and bumped an outer rival inside the final furlong, and
weakened. LA PALMA rated from the four path but was empty going into the stretch. ROYAL JUBILEE tracked the early pace from five wide but never
menaced.

Footnotes
KENTUCKY PRIDE set a rated pace in the two path, dug in inside of PERFECT KIMBERLY S when that foe reached even terms rounding the far turn,
dueled to the wire and narrowly prevailed. PERFECT KIMBERLY S stalked the winner in the three path, reached even terms outside of that foe around the
far turn, battled to the wire and lost the bob. KARENVILLE settled off the early pace while racing three wide, edged closer two wide around the far turn,
tipped back out in upper stretch and had a mild gain. THRILLING BABY saved ground off the pace and rallied inside. HOT BODE settled off the early pace
while racing three wide, advanced five wide around the far turn and evened out in the lane. NO NANNETTE NO failed to menace while racing two wide.
ROSA STAR chased the pace two wide around the first turn and four wide around the far turn and was one-paced in the lane. SWEET ACTRESS saved
ground off the pace, went four wide around the far turn and never threatened.

Footnotes
SOVEREIGN OF SPEED set the pace from the three path, was cued to open up while cutting the corner turning into the lane, and was much the best.
FISHING FOR FUN pressed the pace from the two path, was roused from the three path into the lane, had no chance with the winner but held on for place.
CHIQUIRIN trailed along the inside early, moved up while swinging out to the six path turning into the stretch, and kept on for show. LOVE IN PARADISE
stalked the pace from the three path but was one paced through the lane. TWELVE O'CLOCK rated from the four path early but finished evenly through the
stretch. CATCHING MAGIC raced in midpack from the four path but was empty in the stretch. CUPID'S GHOST chased from the five path but was tired
going into the far turn.

Footnotes
LEOPARDI prompted the pace three wide, took over in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. CAPTURETHELAUGHTER bumped twice with MOMENT
OF ZEN the first time through the stretch, raced off the pace two wide, advanced four wide around the far turn and ran on for the place. MR. CELLULAR
tracked the pace in the two path, bid inside of foes nearing the eighth pole but was outkicked. TRAPPE THE WIND set the early pace in the two path,
settled back down the backstretch, went in the three path around the far turn and stayed on for a minor share. MOMENT OF ZEN was bumped twice early,
raced off the pace four and five wide, made some gains around the far turn but faded in the drive. TAKEMYSHOT advanced four wide around the first turn
to take the lead, cleared off down the backstretch, set the pace in the two path around the far turn and tired in the lane. MORE THAN GRAY was off a step
slow and was outrun inside.

TAPTHESPEEDOFSOUND stalked while three wide, was cued to bid going into the far turn, took over and opened up at the top of the lane, and held sway.
CHESS'S DREAM rated in the three path, swung out to the six path entering the stretch, and ran on down the center for place. UNCLE ARMANDO broke
slow and trailed while two wide early, was ridden along from the three path entering the stretch, drifted in before the eighth pole, and kept on from the inside
for show. TIZ A GIANT tracked from inside, was roused while shifting out to the five path entering the stretch, but finished evenly. ADVANCE CASH dueled
for the lead while two wide but yielded at the top of the stretch. K. C. CHIEF dueled for the lead from inside, had to steady at the top of the stretch, but
gaveway. METEORITO raced in midpack while two wide early, was roused into the far turn, was pulled up midway around the far turn, and was vanned off.

JOLLY MISS JILL set a pressured pace in the two path, angled to the rail in upper stretch and drew off under a drive. BROWN EYED BEAUTY was up close
inside down the backstretch, swung out entering the turn, chased in the four path around most of the turn, drifted out near the quarter pole and stayed on to
gain the place. CAJUN FANTASY angled out early, chased the pace five wide around the turn, angled in near the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in
the lane and finished evenly to gain the show. SASSY BUT PRECIOUS lagged inside for a half and rallied belatedly along the rail. FORTUNA BELLE
pressed the winner in the three path and weakened through the lane. TURN ON THE CHARM failed to menace while racing two wide. PROVOKE ME
played no factor while racing four wide. LOVE MAMI LOVE was outrun while racing two wide. BEAUTIFUL ASTRAY was outrun inside.

Footnotes
DOO WOP DON was squeezed, steadied, and possibly clipped heels in the opening quarter, dropped back to trail from the five path, tucked inside around
the turn, was ridden through an opening three wide into the stretch, bid for the lead passing the eighth pole and drew clear. GET SET rated from inside, was
coaxed around the turn, shifted out to the six path turning into the lane, and ran on but was second best. URANIUM set the pace from inside, opened up
from the two path turning into the lane, but yielded in the final furlong to show. DOMINICAN ICE bumped with an outer rival multiple times in the first quarter
mile, tracked from the two path, shifted inside in upper stretch, but flattened. SENSEI LAWRENCE tracked from the four path, took aim from the five path
entering the lane, but faded. STARLITE WALKER stalked from the three path, bumped and bothered an inner rival approaching the half, and was no threat.
POSEIDON'S SON was bumped between rivals multiple times and squeezed out going into the turn, and was unable to challenge.

final furlong, and held sway. SILENT CHAOS trailed from the four path around the first turn, moved up while three wide rounding the far turn, took aim from
the three path into the stretch, bid passing the eighth pole but was repelled to place. ANOTHER DUKE raced from wellback in the four path, was hustled
from the six path into the stretch, and ran on down the center for show. CHARMING CHARLIE bumped with an inner rival at the start, chased in the four
path, was ridden from said position into the lane, but finished evenly. EYES OF CHAMPION was bumped on both sides leaving the gate, raced from off the
pace in the two path, was short of room and shuffled back to last around the far turn, shifted out to the seven path in upper stretch, and was gaining late.
BYE BYE DAVID raced in midfield from the five path, ranged up while four wide around the far turn, but evened out in the stretch. BIRDNOTE rated from the
four path but flattened down the lane. TOSCANITO led while two wide around the first turn, cut the corner into the lane, but yielded in the final furlong.
GOLDEN INDY was steadied into the first turn, raced in midpack from the two path but was never a threat. PANORAMA TRUCK bumped an inner foe at the
start, tracked in the three path but gave way at the top of the stretch. J P CORNETTA bumped with an outer foe at the start, stalked along the inside but
backed up around the far turn.
