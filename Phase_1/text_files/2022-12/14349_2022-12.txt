Footnotes
NEW YORK SUPREME broke a bit awkwardly then was hustled and brushed with an opponent, contested the pace on the inside of two foes, was guided
with some extra left-rein pressure leaving the backstretch, vied in the two path around the turn, shook clear late on that bend, responded well when set
down in upper stretch, drifted out while shortening stride late and held under steady urging. FLATTERING GAL displayed good speed, disputed the pace
between horses, vied in the three path while still between foes on the turn, dropped behind the winner late on that bend, remained on her inside lead until
outside the furlong marker then swapped to the proper lead, kept on in pursuit of the winner in the final furlong, was carried out late and missed while clear
for the place. BONANA FANNA FOE was pinched back while in tight between foes early, dropped from the three path to the rail early on the turn, moved
back to the three path late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch, remained on her inside lead in the drive and lacked the needed response while able
to get the show. TONIGHT WE LOVE was taken in hand when foes came down from the outside early then was coaxed along off the pace, rounded the turn
in the two path under strong encouragement and failed to rally. FROSTY INVASION broke in and brushed the gate, steadied some while put in tight against
the rail early, moved off the inside under urging, went three wide on the turn, dropped to the rail at the quarter-pole, shifted out nearing the furlong marker
and failed to respond. WARSALM came inward and put foes in tight early, dropped back while urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn and
came up empty. MADAME ROSE was carried in early, pressed the pace on the outside of two foes, vied in the four then five path on the turn, dropped back
near the five-sixteenths and retreated.

Footnotes
SHE'S A BLACK BELT established the front and crossed to show the way in hand along the inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through
the turn patiently handled, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, got roused at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive under threat from flanking
challengers and just lasted on the wire. PRAIRIE FIRE chased inside briefly early on before tipping three wide at the nine-sixteenths, tucked back inside into
the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and
just missed at the end. BIG Q coaxed from the gate, chased two then three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch
and missed. GREATEST LOVE chased two to three wide down the backstretch and then four wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths,
angled six wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid but was outkicked. DAT DARES GOLD coaxed from the gate, chased three wide under coaxing
from the three-eighths and weakened in the stretch. AFLEET DIVA four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued four wide for
home, weakened in the drive.

Footnotes
DRAKE'S PASSAGE was hustled from the start then urged along on the outside, chased four then three wide on the turn, gained to take the lead nearing
the five-sixteenths, dropped to the two path while shaking clear at the quarter-pole, responded well in the stretch and held under strong urging. BOURBON
CHASE settled off the pace, was urged along while saving ground on the turn, chased the winner under a drive in the stretch and was second best. WANNA
WINNA settled under some urging, went four wide on the turn, pursued the winner under a drive into the final furlong and weakened while able to get the
show. ZAPRUDER settled off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, shifted from the three path to the five path while gaining on the turn, held a
reasonable striking position under a drive into upper stretch, chased into the final furlong and flattened out then missed the trifecta. INSPECTOR moved in
leaving the chute, was well placed towards the front, chased along the rail on the turn, made a bid at the five-sixteenths, shifted three wide while losing
touch with the winner into the stretch and tired. MORETHANAFEELING tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased three wide around the turn, dropped
back late on that bend, spun four wide into the stretch and capitulated. SHARPAZ lost his footing and bobbled some at the start, bumped with MAMA
BANNED ME early then had that foe clip his heels, went to the front while in hand, vied in the two path on the turn, lost the lead to the winner approaching
the five-sixteenths and faded. MAMA BANNED ME bumped with the hindquarters of SHARPAZ early then was turned out, clipped the heels of that foe and
unseated the rider.

DIVINE WINE came away in tandem with a foe at the rear of the field, angled out early, moved up outside the half-mile pole, issued a challenge in the four
path around the turn, took the lead in upper stretch, disposed of the runner-up under steady urging into the final sixteenth then was placed under lighter
encouragement while best. MOSTLY HARMLESS was well placed just off the pace, moved out near the half-mile pole, made a bid with seven-sixteenths to
run, vied in the three then two path around the turn, took the lead outside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and was
outfinished while well clear for the place. FULIGNI settled off the pace, chased while moving from the two path to the four path around the turn, spun five
wide into the stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. BOXED IN AND BORED showed speed from the outside post then set the pace, moved from

Footnotes
LOST IN ROME was restless in the gate then had his head turned at the start, settled on the outside, was asked five wide on the turn, rallied outside in
upper stretch, closed well to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, fought outside of two foes from that point to the wire, came in ever so slightly late and
got up to prevail. O'TROUBLE went to the front, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the lead under a drive into
upper stretch, regained a narrow advantage into the final furlong, led past the sixteenth-pole but was denied while able to get the place. EASY DAY was
hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside, vied in the four then three path around the turn, took a short lead into upper stretch, lost the
advantage back to the runner-up into the final sixteenth, fought between foes in the final sixteenth, was taken up while being outfinished late and missed
while well clear for the show. RUNABOUT was urged along off the pace, went four wide on the turn and came up empty. STYNER was hustled from the
start, showed speed then pressed the pace, vied between foes in the three path on the turn, dropped back outside the quarter-pole and tired. F F ROCKET
moved out while urged along off the pace, rounded most of the turn in the two path then shifted three wide and capitulated. NUTSIE stumbled at the start,
raced at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, saved ground into the stretch and was no factor. TRIGGER PULL was urged along
off the pace, went four to five wide on the turn and failed to respond.
