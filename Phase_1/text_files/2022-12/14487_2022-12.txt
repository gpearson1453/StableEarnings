Footnotes
COUGER set the pace while racing keenly, continued better settled on the lead in the two path on the far turn, kept on inside in the lane and held sway
under a drive from midstretch. PRANCIPANTS stalked the leader around the clubhouse turn and while pulling down the backstretch, lost a bit of ground on
the leader as the rider tried to settle him, took closer order on the pacesetter into the second turn, stalked in the three path around the bend, came three
wide into the lane, chased on willingly while drifting out but could not get to the leader. WATCHIN THE WHEELS chased inside around the clubhouse turn,
chased the leading pair down the backstretch, tracked that pair in the four to five path on the far turn, came into the lane in the four path, proved no match
for the top two, weakened late but held the show. BOWS N LACE was positioned two wide in the rear flight around the first turn, raced inside of
LINDALOUIMAGE in the rear flight into the back straight, continued unhurried from there, trailed in the two to three path on the far turn, swung out to the five
path into upper stretch for the drive and lacked the needed rally. LINDALOUIMAGE raced three wide at the rear around the first turn, chased toward the rear
down the back straight, raced in the five path on the far turn while still toward the rear, began to empty out near the five sixteenths, floated into the six path
into the lane and continued to weaken.

Footnotes
BORN AGAIN GEORGE was prompted to a forward placing along the inside to track just off the leaders racing into the turn, advanced inside those foes
nearing upper stretch to wrest the advantage while tipping a bit off the inside and made the balance of the pace under firm handling. EASTER MUSIC was
rated from out of striking distance tracking the leaders along the inside racing into the bend, angled closest to the rail entering upper stretch and was going
well late inside the winner. CHOPPER sprinted clear of the field from the outset while angling to the inside, dictated the pace on a clear margin through the
bend, tipped out to the three path racing into upper stretch and yielded to the top pair in the last furlong. GREELEYS ICE was roused from the break
pursuing the pacesetter near the inside into the bend, shifted out racing into upper stretch and gave out between foes nearing the furlong marker. HIGH
HERO tracked the leaders from well out of striking distance four wide through the backstretch into the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch but
offered no rally. APPLICANT settled between foes in the last flight in the opening stages and faded racing into the turn. OLSON, restless in the gate prior to
the start, was slow to gather stride and proved no factor. BOOM FIVE THOUSAND refused to break when the stall gates opened but walked off under his
own power. FOLLOWING THE RACE THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START BUT TOOK NO ACTION.

RENTAL POOL tracked the leader inside of CAIRO SUMMER through the clubhouse turn, tracked NOCTURNAL MISSION down the back straight,
encroached outside that foe two wide past the three eighths, loomed into the lane, drifted out in upper stretch, responded when ridden past the furlong mark
and drew away while drifting out a few more paths. NOCTURNAL MISSION was sent for speed inside, set the pace, hugged the rail around the far turn, was
engaged by RENTAL POOL past the three eighths, clung to a narrow lead inside into the lane, proved no match for that foe past the furlong mark, drifted
out a few paths late but held on for place. CAIRO SUMMER tracked the leader outside of RENTAL POOL around the clubhouse turn, settled back to track
the leading pair down the back straight, saved ground on the far turn while well behind the leading pair, came into the lane in the four path, chased on with
interest while no match for the leaders and narrowly missed the place. HARD LIKE HOLLY settled in second last well behind the leading trip, raced in the
four path on the far turn, floated out near the center of the track into upper stretch and chased on only evenly under a drive. BEZEL SET settled at the rear,
raced in the two path on the far turn, came into the lane in the three path, offered no rally and was allowed to trail home through the final furlong.

Footnotes
CARTE BLANCHE was urged to the lead along the inside racing to the first turn, pulled against rating dictating the pace through the backstretch, responded
when prompted to widen his margin racing into upper stretch and held sway to the end under pressure. KRAMDEN tracked the pacesetter inside foes to the
backstretch, tipped outside a rival racing into the far turn, shifted out to the four path in upper stretch and continued with a solid response to edge a rival for
the place honors on the wire. TWO COOKIE RULE tracked the leaders three wide between foes into the backstretch, angled nearer the inside racing into
the far turn, then kept on with interest near the inside to just miss for second. YAK was settled last while angling to the inside racing to the backstretch,
switched outside rivals after a half, raced four wide through the far turn, then was fanned to the five path in upper stretch to gain some position but made no
impression on the leaders. RIVER FINN was urged between foes into the first turn to prompt the pacesetter into the backstretch, continued in pursuit of that
rival to the second bend and steadily faded racing through far turn. BOURBON DELIGHT, caught four wide racing into the first turn, continued in that path to
the backstretch and dropped out early. ADDED TIMES FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
MINISTRY OF ART prompted the pace outside of STORM'S REFLECTION, prompted between that foe and TEA AFTER BALLET down the back straight,
pressed two wide around the far turn, came three wide into the lane, vied outside of the pacesetter, took over in the final sixteenth and held off WELLER
ROGUE. The latter was hard to settle at the rear, continued patiently down the back straight, rallied in the three to four path on the far turn while racing a bit
keenly, sustained his rally three to four wide between horses in the lane and gained well to the finish. RIP IT RYAN was restless in the gate, chased midfield
around the first turn, continued inside of CAPTAIN CARNEGIE down the backstretch, chased between horses on the far turn, took closer order in tandem
with CAPTAIN CARNEGIE from the three eighths, swung four wide into the lane, sustained his rally, but was outkicked late for the place. STORM'S
REFLECTION was urged for speed inside, set the pace while prompted by MINSTRY OF ART, continued on a pressured pace in the two path on the far
turn, was driven inside in upper stretch, continued to vie inside of MINISTRY OF ART to the sixteenth, flattened and drifted out late.
CLASSOFSIXTYSEVEN settled near the rear, rallied while saving ground around the far turn, swung three wide into the lane, angled out further from there,
and passed tiring horses. TEA AFTER BALLET advanced three wide on the first turn to attend outside the leading flight, continued to attend the pace to the
five eighths, settled back to track the pace inside around the far turn, proved no match for the leaders from upper stretch, and flattened in the lane.
CAPTAIN CARNEGIE tracked the leading line through the clubhouse turn, settled back to midpack for the backstretch run, continued midpack three wide on
the far turn, began to improve in tandem with RIP IT RYAN near the three eighths, swung six wide into the lane and flattened out. DARE GOES DA DEVIL
raced toward the rear inside of FUTURE VISION around the first turn, advanced inside foes to chase the leading trio down the back straight, chased while
saving ground around the far turn, began to flatten out approaching the quarter and had no more in the lane. FUTURE VISION raced toward the rear outside
of DARE GOES DA DEVIL around the first turn, continued toward the rear down the backstretch, raced in the six path on the far turn, swung toward the
center of the track into the lane and came up empty. OFF TO THE BEACH chased outside of CAPTAIN CARNEGIE around the fist turn, raced at the rear of
midfield outside of RIP IT RYAN down the back straight, flattened out and trailed in the six path on the far turn, came into the lane three to four wide and had
no response when driven in upper stretch.

Footnotes
PLUS CHIC broke sharply, angled to the inside dictating the pace on a narrow margin under light rating racing to the turn, held sway just off the rail racing
into upper stretch and responded to firm encouragement to maintain her advantage. KEEPMEINTHE MOMENT, pulling a bit along the inside tracking just
off the pacesetter racing through the backstretch, tipped out racing into upper stretch while being prompted to advance but proved only second best. GO
MADI GO was settled last, then angled to the rail midway through the backstretch, saved ground through the turn and was making steady progress to close
the gap inside the winner in the closing stages. WAY TOO SMARTE was settled well off the leaders in the opening stages while shifting off the inside,
angled five wide racing into upper stretch and made an effort to improve position. SHARP HERO tracked the leaders between foes in second flight racing to
the turn, shifted out three wide racing into upper stretch and faded in the drive. STOPSHOPPINGAMY tracked the pacesetter three deep as part of the
second flight racing to the turn and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
GITA'S LAD was nudged along to show early pace, cleared to the inside into the first turn, was engaged outside by STALLONE into the backstretch, lost the
lead to that foe near the three quarters, regained it near the five eighths, saved ground on the lead on the far turn while still pressured by STALLONE,
cleared past the five sixteenths, drove further clear through midstretch and held sway. BABA'S BOY chased inside around the clubhouse turn, continued
inside of FIRST MASAMUNE down the back straight, rallied in the two path on the far turn, sustained his rally up the inside into the lane, drifted out a bit late
but continued to improve to the wire. FIRST MASAMUNE tracked the leading pair around the clubhouse turn, was joined to the outside by CARLOS L. and
SEMINOLE BEACH into the backstretch and then passed by those foes, settled back to chase midfield, was pushed along in the six path on the far turn,
swung out near the center of the track into the lane, and rallied under a drive to prove best of the rest. STALLONE tracked the leader around the clubhouse
turn, engaged outside of GITA'S LAD into the backstretch, wrested a narrow lead near the three quarters, was overtaken by GITA'S LAD near the five
eighths, continued to prompt outside that foe until proving no match near the quarter, came three wide into the lane and flattened out. ANDREW THE
GIANT settled near the rear around the clubhouse turn, raced three wide with the rear group down the back straight, was pushed along in the two to three
path on the far turn and began to improve, came two wide into the lane, drifted out a bit and kept on mildly. GOING WITH STYLE settled at the inside of the
rear flight, raced near the rear in the two path on the far turn, came into the lane inside and chased on mildly. SEMINOLE BEACH chased around the first
turn, improved between horses into the backstretch in tandem with CARLOS L, chased the leading pair down the back straight, was pushed along in the five
path on the far turn but began to flatten, was driven four wide in the lane but had no more. SCAT SHACK raced two wide in the rear flight, continued toward
the rear between horses on the back straight, raced at the rear in the three path on the far turn, went to a drive in upper stretch and did not rally. CARLOS L.
chased outside of SEMINOLE BEACH through the first turn, was keen three wide into the backstretch, chased the leading trio down the backstretch,
emptied out in the four path on the far turn and was allowed to trail home.

Footnotes
WILDWOOD BYE was caught in close quarters at the start while getting away last, settled inside foes racing through the backstretch, gathered momentum
entering the turn, swung out five wide racing into upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest the advantage in time under firm handling.
STORMY EMPIRE angled inwards in the opening stages to track off the first flight between foes racing through the backstretch, was prompted to advance
while shifting out four wide racing into upper stretch, bid for command leaving the furlong marker to strike the front between calls late but couldn't contain the
winner. MAUREENLOVESFRANK was urged inside foes while shifting a bit off the rail disputing the pace through the backstretch, edged clear to a narrow
advantage midway through the turn, was roused to resist several challenges racing past midstretch but yielded to the top pair late. CATCHUSIFYOUCAN
tracked just off the first flight inside foes racing through the backstretch, tipped out nearing upper stretch to bid for command between foes but was
outkicked. AVASARALA was urged three wide between foes from the outset pressing the pace into the turn and gave way into upper stretch. JOLIE RULER
tracked off the second flight five wide in the opening stages, was fanned to the seven path racing into upper stretch and passed some tiring rivals late. IGGY
BIGS tracked off the first flight four wide between foes on the backstretch but steadily faded racing into the turn. CHROME ATTACK flashed brief pace four
wide in the opening quarter but gave way racing into the turn. RACEDAY ATTIRE urged between foes from the outset pressing the pace through the
backstretch into the turn, was spent after a half. TAP'S LULLABY was a step slow into stride and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
MY LADY SLEW broke inward but nonetheless sharply, was placed on the lead, set the pace in the two path on the turn, swung three wide into upper
stretch, was engaged by RUNNERS HEAT at that point but shook clear of that foe nearing midstretch while under a drive, and ran on safe to the wire while
kept to the task. MUD HUT chased the leading trio, improved to track the leading pair while positioned three wide on the turn, floated six wide into the lane
and continued to chase the leaders, kept on under a drive and got up for the place late. RUNNERS HEAT was sent three deep but outsprinted by MY LADY
SLEW to the lead, tracked that pacesetter outside of SEQUAYA down the backstretch, continued to track the pace while positioned two wide on the turn,
swung four wide into the lane and bid outside of MY LADY SLEW, loomed in upper stretch, proved no match approaching the furlong mark and flattened
out. MAIDEN ROCK raced near the rear inside, was pushed along in the two path past the three eighths, improved while drifting out in upper stretch, leveled
out late and salvaged a share of fourth. MORNING LINE NEWS chased inside of GOSHEN GIRL early, continued midfield in the three path on the turn,
drifted out in upper stretch, and kicked on belatedly to get on even terms with MAIDEN ROCK at the wire. QUEEN EKATI settled near the rear between
horses, inched up in the four path on the turn, swung six wide into the lane, was forced out further as MORNING LINE NEWS drifted out, and passed
outside tiring horses. SEQUAYA was hard hustled between horses but outsprinted to the lead, tracked the leader inside of RUNNERS HEAT, saved ground
while chasing around the turn, came into the lane inside and flattened. AIR WALKER took up hard in the opening strides as a result of MY LADY SLEW
breaking inward, settled along the rail, was driven inside in upper stretch, improved to midfield and flattened out late. FROST WARRIOR settled near the
rear, raced in the three path on the turn, came two wide into the lane and lacked the needed response. GOSHEN GIRL chased outside of MORNING LINE
NEWS early, was pushed along midfield in the five path on the turn, floated seven wide into the lane and came up empty. DRAGONFLY KISSES raced near
the rear three deep early, weakened in the six to seven path on the turn, floated into the lane near the center of the course and had no more.
