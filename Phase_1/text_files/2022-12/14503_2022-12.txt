Footnotes
IMAGISM quickly took control, widened in the stretch and remained safe while kept to her business. TREASURE SEEKER lacked speed, advanced near the
inside and closed well for the place. ONLY GIRL saved ground early, moved wide on the turn and continued willingly. ANGELOFTHEGALAXY raced in
closest pursuit of the pacesetter then faded in the stretch. ESCANDALO was urged off the leaders wide and gave way readily. CHARLY'S CHOO CHOO
broke sluggishly and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LONDONDERRY raced off the rail, off the pace, advanced on the far turn, swung wide, rallied outside in the stretch drive, surged outside rivals in deep
stretch and got up at the wire for the win. NOT A TRACE set the pace racing a bit off the inside, dueled with LADY FOX midway on the far turn, dug in
gamely inside of that rival in the stretch drive, battled on determinedly to the finish and held second. LADY FOX stalked close up two wide, bid on the far
turn, dueled outside of NOT A TRACE, dug in gamely through the stretch run and was outfinished late. BOOM BOOM GIRL tracked close up on the inside,
chased on the far turn and lacked a winning bid. ISABELLA SMILE raced off the pace inside, chased three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane
and lacked a rally. CREEDIBILITY stalked four wide, chased three wide on the far turn and faded. NOT IN THE MOOD stalked three wide and gave way. A
Jockey's Objection by the rider of LADY FOX against NOT A TRACE was dismissed.

THE BIGGEST ONE dueled outside through the opening quarter, shook loose on the turn, drifted out but remained clear driving. CLASSY SADIE well
placed behind the dueling leaders, bid into the stretch then flattened out. LULINDA'S HEART lacked speed, advanced inside and finished willingly. GAVICHI
dropped back in the two path and lacked a response. DON'T TELL FRANKIE lagged far behind then passing fading rivals in the stretch. SWEET LILLY
FACTUM chased wide throughout and weakened steadily. SEA FRET dueled along the rail to the three eighths pole and stopped.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT set the pace on the inside, opened up on the far turn, widened, was geared down in the final furlong and galloped home. MANI
PEDI stalked two wide early, then inside, chased the winner on the far turn, never threatened and remained clear for the place award. ABHAILE raced three
wide early, stalked three wide, chased two wide on the far turn, finished evenly and just held on for third. FRISKY FEELING was reluctant to load, outrun
early, advanced at the quarter pole, closed belatedly outside and just missed for the show spot. VALERIE FIRST tracked on the inside, chased and faded.
CANOOCHEE was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside and did not factor. MARIANNA QUEEN raced off the rail, off the pace, chased three wide on the
far turn and gave way.

ALL HAIL MO urged close up between rivals, pursued on the turn then wore down the pacesetter and edged clear. TRUE PHENOMENON raced outside in
the second flight and finished willingly. LOVE THE HUSTLE lacked speed then advanced outside with some late energy. THENDARA'S LOST sprinted to
the front early, led to the stretch then gave way. BOOK AND CANCEL hustled close up inside then began fading on the turn. HIP HOP HOORAY dropped
back early and lacked a response. LEAPING FOR CANDY broke slowest, was put to urging and always outrun. CULPA BLANCO lagged far behind
throughout. HEAD AND THE HEART dropped back after the start and stopped abruptly.

second. WHERESTHEPASSION raced two wide off the pace, moved up two wide on the turn, rallied between rivals in the stretch and was outfinished for
the place spot. CONNECTING stalked the early pace, chased two wide on the turn and weakened. WEGOTTAGUY vied in the early stages, then tracked on
the inside, chased on the turn and lacked a rally. ROCKIN FREEBEE raced off the pace inside, two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SOUTHERN

BABY FADE angled to the two path initial quarter, saved ground on the turn, angled out in the stretch and prevailed following a long drive.
HAPPYBIRTHDAYCOREY hustled to a clear advantage, was collared into the stretch, fought gamely and just missed. THE FURMANATOR very wide down
the backstretch, began advance on the turn, rallied into the stretch, loomed a threat with a gradual gain. SNAPPY RIDE very wide just off the pace early
then faded on the turn. ANNA VOLANTE stumbled badly at the break, rushed up inside, was in tight near the far turn and faltered. PROSPECTIVE CANDY
raced in closest pursuit of the pacesetter then was finished after half a mile. FASHIONATTA settled three wide within striking range then stopped.

PEACH PERFECT well placed outside the dueling leaders, bid on the final turn, collared the pacesetter and drew away late under moderate urging. SWEET
TALKED vied outside with a narrow lead, shook loose near the three eighths pole, was collared by the winner, resisted but tired in the final furlong. CLOSET
SHOPPER dropped far behind, moved wide on the final turn, rallied mildly and was just up for the show. MEMENTO MI saved ground throughout and
lacked a rally. IRIE EMPRESS dropped back early, raced wide, made a brief bid on the final turn then faded. SUPER DUPER FLY dueled along the inside
to the final turn and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
EL HERMANO saved ground close up, angled out rallying at the quarter pole, rallied and drew off in the final eighth. FRENCH TOAST dueled outside, was
clear briefly at the quarter pole then proved no match for the winner. AMOUNT settled inside, advanced on the final turn and was up for show. BIG
BEAUTIFUL WALL dropped back early, moved wide then flattened out in the stretch. JUST NOD AND SMILE lacked speed, chased very wide on the final
turn and was no threat. GRIT'N'GRIND trailed for five furlongs then some late energy along the inside. MY TRAIN moved closer under rating after a quarter
mile then faltered. SPEIGHTSTER RED moved just off the leaders four wide and faded. LOOK OUT LAMBO lacked speed, moved very wide on the final
turn and was no factor. STILL HAVING FUN prompted the pace to the stretch and gave way. OUTRAGEOUS BET dropped back early and raced far behind
throughout.
