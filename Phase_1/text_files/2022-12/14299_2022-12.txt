Footnotes
JUST WATCH ME NOW showed early speed, pressed the moderate fractions to the turn, assumed command nearing the quarter marker, drew clear
approaching mid-stretch, had the margin cut into a bit in the late stages by the oncoming runner-up and kept to task to prevail. THE CALABRESE KID
bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, chased from the rear to the turn, steadied in tight quarters approaching the three-furlong marker, saved
ground to the top of the lane, advanced in upper stretch and made a good late rally to secure second. REALLY EASY was asked to show early speed and
contested the moderate pace to the turn, lost position nearing the quarter marker, chased JUST WATCH ME NOW to mid-stretch, weakened in the final
stages and held for third. VIVA LEON JODIDO stalked the early pace, took up while in tight nearing the turn, was shuffled back and came three then four
wide nearing the quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. AFRICAN PRINCE chased from the rear, lacked speed
around the turn while three wide and was not a factor in the drive. ONE BROAD STREET hit the gate leaving the break and was away a step slowly,
advanced nearing the turn and tracked the pace three deep approaching the top of the lane, could not sustain that run in the drive and tired. LORD FISC
raced close to the early pace, lost position while two wide on the turn, dropped back leaving the turn and gave way.

Footnotes
LA PRIMER ESTRELLA showed good early speed from the inside, set the contested pace to the turn, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker while
pressured, shook free in upper stretch, pulled away in the final stages and was hand urged to the wire. LOOKIN AT SWEETIE hopped then broke in at the
start and was away slowly, chased three then four wide on the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but finished well in the late stages and was up
for place in the final strides. GETAWAY CHARM pressed the moderate early fractions, kept pressure on the pacesetter to the quarter marker, was outrun in
upper stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was clear for third. ACHROMATIC stalked the early pace, lost ground while two wide on the turn, chased to
mid-stretch and gave way. BIG STORM KITTY tracked the early pace, raced four wide outside of rivals on the turn and tired. GRANOLA GIRL stalked the
early pace, raced three wide along the turn and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
TRAVEL THE MAP away in good order and established the early lead, set a pressured pace through the backstretch run, was well rated while carving out
decent fractions to the second turn, turned away TRINIDAD in upper stretch and drew away in the late stages in a good debut. CALCULATED SPIN stalked
the early pace, saved all of the ground to the second turn, lost position nearing the top of the lane, ran evenly to mid-stretch, was no match for the winner in
deep stretch and ran on in the final stages to secure second. TRINIDAD raced close up to the pace, came three wide along the first turn, advanced along
the backstretch run and pressed the pace to the second turn, kept pressure on TRAVEL THE MAP to the quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch,
weakened in the late stages and was edged for third. KIT KAT MAN was away slowly, settled off of the decent early pace, came two wide along the second
turn and lacked a late rally. TACOMA SOUND stumbled leaving the start and was away slowly, was allowed to settle, improved position three wide on the
far turn and did not offer a late response in the drive. CUT ACROSS SHORTY showed early speed, pressed the decent fractions to the half-mile marker,
lost ground on the second turn and gave way. NORTHERN JEWEL hesitated at the start and spotted the field leaving the break, trailed through the
backstretch run, lost contact on the second turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
AUSTRIAN NAVY was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the moderate pace to the quarter marker, battled with DESERT SMOKE to mid-stretch,
wore down that foe inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. CLOCHARD STREET settled off of the early moderate fractions,
raced two wide between foes along the turn, swung three wide for the drive, advanced nearing mid-stretch, finished well in the final stages, could not reel in
the winner in deep stretch and was up for place. WICKED SUNSET raced up close to the early pace, tracked the pace from the inside to the quarter marker,
swung three wide for the drive, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and dead-heated for show. DESERT SMOKE drifted in at the start and impeded ST.
ANNIE'S INDY, showed good early speed and set the moderate early pace, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, battled with AUSTRIAN NAVY to
mid-stretch, could not hold that rival off inside of the furlong marker, weakened in deep stretch and dead-heated for third. TAKES A VILLAGE tracked the
early pace, raced three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive and did not produce a late response. FOCUS FIRST bobbled leaving the start and
was away a step slowly, chased the pace to the turn, saved ground to the top of the lane and lacked a late rally. ST. ANNIE'S INDY was bothered leaving
the start when DESERT SMOKE drifted in, chased from the rear to the turn, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, swung six wide for the drive
and tired in the late stages. THE STEWARDS CONDUCTED AN INQUIRY INTO THE START INVOLVING ST. ANNIE'S INDY AND DESERT SMOKE. IN A
UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT DESERT SMOKE DRIFTED IN AT THE START, IMPEDED ST. ANNIE'S INDY AND COST
THAT RUNNER THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BETTER PLACING. DESERT SMOKE WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THIRD AND PLACED SEVENTH.

Footnotes
BLAZE OF DREAMS was off a step slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, improved position along the turn while two wide, swung five wide for the
drive, closed well in mid-stretch, confronted SYNNIN AND WINNIN nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled with that game rival to the wire and determinedly
won the nod. SYNNIN AND WINNIN took back off of the early pace and stalked the moderate fractions into the turn, advanced three wide nearing the
quarter marker, took a narrow lead nearing the furlong pole, met the bid of BLAZE OF DREAMS nearing the sixteenth-marker, dueled with that foe to the
wire and was gamely bested, while clear of the rest for second. HEZA VALENTINE was away a step slowly and was allowed to settle, raced two wide into
the turn, improved position in upper stretch, was not able to impact the top pair in the final stages but finished well and was up for third in the final strides.
MANY AMBITIONS chased the pace to the turn, raced along the rail then tipped out two wide nearing the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive and
did not offer a late rally. AWESOME MOVE was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the moderate pace between rivals to the quarter marker,
battled for the lead to the furlong grounds and weakened. BLUE SILVER was away alertly and showed good early speed to dictate terms to the turn, set a
pressured pace to the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. RANCHO RED tracked the early fractions from the second flight,
raced three wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and gave way.

Footnotes
UNWHIRLED was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide outside of rivals along the first turn and into the backstretch run, was roused leaving the
three-furlong pole, assumed command leaving the second turn, drew clear nearing mid-stretch and pulled away under a hand ride in the final stages. ON
VACATION was allowed to settle, was roused three wide on the second turn, improved position in upper stretch, was not able to make headway on
UNWHIRLED in the drive but stayed on in deep stretch to secure the place. PEACEHAVEN hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, recovered to
settle in the second flight through the backstretch run, made an inside rally nearing the quarter marker, chased the leaders to mid-stretch, was outfinished in
deep stretch, just missed for second and was clear for third in the final stages. COUNCILWOMAN JILLY broke alertly and was forwardly placed into the first
turn, prompted the solid fractions through the backstretch run, assumed command on the far turn, could not keep pace with UNWHIRLED in upper stretch
and weakened in the final furlong. BIG JOLT was allowed to settle, raced three wide along the first turn, lost position nearing the second turn, came three
then four wide to the top of the lane and did not threaten. CAL ROUGH settled off of the early pace while in the second flight, saved ground through the
backstretch run, came in tight on the second turn, took up midway through the bend, was shuffled back approaching the quarter marker and lacked a late
rally. BEA MISCHIEF lacked early speed and was a bit rank into the first turn, trailed through the backstretch run, raced three wide to the quarter marker,
swung five wide for the drive and was not a factor. NASHIRA'S FIRE stalked the early solid pace, advanced two wide on the far turn and vied for the lead
nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. HEAVEN'S GHOST was sent after a good start, set a pressured pace through the
backstretch run, was overtaken nearing the second turn, lost contact nearing the top of the lane, was eased through the stretch run and walked off under her
own power.

Footnotes
MEMO DADDY (CHI) was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the backstretch run, angled in approaching the second turn, came two wide while
advancing to the quarter marker, mounted an inside rally in upper stretch, assumed command leaving the furlong marker and held in a drive over the
oncoming runner-up. OUR SILVER OAK rated off of the solid early pace, saved ground to the second turn, was roused three wide leaving the quarter
marker, loomed in upper stretch, vied for the lead nearing the furlong pole, was outfinished in the final stages and stayed on late to be second best.
JEFFNJOHN'STHUNDR was unhurried in the early stages, raced four wide into the backstretch run, trailed to the second turn, came two wide to the quarter
marker, swung widest into upper stretch and mounted a six wide rally for the drive, could not reel in the top pair in deep stretch and was well clear for third in
the late stages. MOHAWK KING (IRE) was sent to the early lead, raced off of the rail while setting solid fractions through the backstretch run, dictated terms
to the quarter marker, drifted out a bit at the head of the lane and came two wide into the drive, could not keep pace with MEMO DADDY inside of the
furlong marker and weakened. PAPAPIFAS tracked the early pace from the second flight, raced three wide into the second turn, swung five wide for the
drive, lost ground nearing mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. NOLDE raced close to the early pace, stalked the pace three wide into the backstretch run,
kept close attendance to the pacesetter to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PASSARANDO was away a step slowly and was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground while making a steady advance along the backstretch and into
the second turn, loomed in upper stretch, angled out nearing the furlong pole, came within aim of CHASE THE CHAOS just inside of the sixteenth-marker
and made a strong late run in deep stretch to prevail. CHASE THE CHAOS was allowed to settle, raced two wide along the first turn, was roused leaving the
three-furlong marker and loomed four wide approaching the top of the lane, overtook the pacesetter just inside of the furlong pole, was confronted in deep
stretch by PASSARANDO and could not hold that foe off in the final stages and held safely for second. O B'S steadied at the start and spotted the field
leaving the break, was unhurried in the early stages, saved all of the ground to the second turn, rallied in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the
sixteenth-marker, was outkicked by the top pair in the final stages and kept on to be clear for third. HAPPY DOES settled off of the early pace while traveling
in the second flight, saved ground to the second turn, advanced in upper stretch and was outkicked in the drive. CLOVISCONNECTION showed good early
speed from the inside and established the pace into the first turn, set solid fractions through the backstretch run, drew clear nearing the quarter marker,
extended the lead to mid-stretch, tired readily in the final stages and was overtaken inside of the furlong marker. ITS THIEVERY was allowed to settle, came
in tight along the first turn, raced three then two wide along the second turn and did not threaten in the final stages. WOUND UP was away a step slowly,
settled off of the solid early pace, raced two wide along the second turn, swung six wide for the drive and did not offer a late rally. SEA DOG was forwardly
placed in the early stages, was a bit rank into the first turn, advanced along the backstretch run and pressed the solid pace to the second turn, dropped back
in upper stretch and faltered. CHUCKANUT BAY raced three wide into the first turn while in the second flight, came five wide along the far turn, swung
seven wide for the drive and tired in the final furlong. SMOKIN' HOT showed early speed and stalked the pace three wide into the first turn, raced close up
to the sold pace to the second turn, lost ground nearing the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and gave way in the stretch run.

Footnotes
CHILLY WILLY broke well and made the lead without being pushed, grabbed the rail path while being dogged to the outside by SGT POWELL then was
also joined by CHROME'S ORBIT passing the quarter pole, the three of them fanned into the stretch together, had something left when called upon and
edged clear in the final stages. SGT POWELL hustled to the lead, took a position on the flank of CHILLY WILLY, shadowed that one through the turn, was
joined by CHROME'S ORBIT to his outside on the turn for home, held that one off but was outfinished by the winner while clearly second best. RUNNING
ON FIRE prominent early while under restraint, was held up a bit going into the turn, had to wait for running room while staying to the inside turning for
home, found a seam in mid-stretch and finished strongly to gain third. SMILE AND PROFILE was off slowly, fell far behind, then rushed up to join the field
within a furlong, moved over to the inside approaching the turn, was idling behind horses to mid-stretch, swerved out into the path of ONE BIG SMILE when
going for an opening, then swerved back inside, nearly clipping heels with CHROME'S ORBIT, from there managed to run straight but evenly to the wire.
CHROME'S ORBIT was close early, stayed in the three path through the turn, made a bid for the lead with a quarter mile to go but weakened in stretch.
ONE BIG SMILE broke out and bumped TOP WOLF after the break, moved away from the rail , was rank while in tight between horses into and through the
turn, swung out to the four path for the run home, was forced to check when SMILE AND PROFILE swerved into his path in mid-stretch and came up empty
from that point. THEUNTOUCHABLEONE broke alertly, raced mid-pack during the early stages, stayed clear of traffic while racing in the three or four path,
made steady forward progress through the turn, loomed a threat nearing the quarter pole, altered course in deep stretch to avoid a swerving rival and
flattened. TOP WOLF fell back after the break, was asked to join the pack down the backstretch, got boxed in and had to steady at the three furlong pole,
swung out to the five path for the stretch then did not have much to offer late. START THEM UP broke a step slow then was outrun early despite the rider's
urging and trailed the field throughout. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE STRETCH RUN. IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION, THE
STEWARDS DISQUALIFIED SMILE AND PROFILE FOR INTERFERENCE AND WAS PLACED SEVENTH.
