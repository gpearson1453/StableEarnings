late stretch run but was not enough. CALLINGINTHENIGHT raced in the middle of the pack around the first turn then was allowed to settle while saving
ground made a rebid at the eighth pole and passed tiring rivals. TOO MUCH CROWN raced near the back around the first turn then moved up from four
wide on the backstretch, was three wide into upper stretch but failed to menace. ANDIAMO GIACOMO was forwardly placed to the five sixteenths pole and
dropped back. BOURBON ST TAPPIN was unhurried around the first turn then moved between horses into the second turn and faltered.

eighth pole and drew off. LOUIS LE GRANDE was placed close up on the inside through the final turn then split horses in early stretch but was no match for
the winner. BODE'S LIGHT stalked the pace from the two path to the final turn moved three wide on the turn and fought gamely in the stretch drive but was
out kicked. BIG RESULTS was six wide into the first turn and was unhurried around the turn, moved up from two to three wide around the final turn moved

Footnotes
CASEYS MEMORY was allowed to settle through the first turn and down the backstretch then moved up going five wide in upper stretch to just be up.
CLEAR HUMOR stalked the pace from the three path, was three wide in upper stretch and dueled with the JAZZY JUSTIN to the wire and was out finished
by the late closer. JAZZY JUSTIN was placed off the pace to the final turn then moved up to take the lead at the eighth pole, dueled to the wire inside of
CLEAR HUMOR and was out kicked by the late closer. LOVETHATCAUSE saved ground to the final turn and moved between horses then made a rail bid
in the stretch but lacked the late kick. SPEEDY FELLAR was unhurried around the first turn then settled near the back down the backstretch went four wide
at the three sixteenths pole and closed well. FRANK THE MAYOR was not a threat. MASTERLY was forwardly placed around the first turn while saving
ground and retreated on the backstretch. PARLAY PETE was rushed to the early lead then vied for the lead down the backstretch and gave way in early
stretch. FEARLESS WILL vied for the lead around the first turn then took a brief lead at the five sixteenths pole and stopped.

Footnotes
SADIE'S RANSOM broke out and bumped MAYWON at the start then rushed up to duel for the lead from the inside to the quarter pole, inched away and
drew off to prove much the best. OUR CLOVER GAL broke out at the start then dueled for the lead from between horses to the quarter pole but was no
match late for the winner. VALID BREAK dueled for the lead from three wide to the quarter pole and weakened but was able to hold on for the show. FIRE
VISION chased the leaders throughout. MAYWON was bumped by SADIE'S RANSOM at the start then was hustled up the rail and raced evenly.
BALTIMORE BABE failed to menace. MORO MOLLY was always back. MORO DRAMA QUEEN broke in at the start but was never involved.
