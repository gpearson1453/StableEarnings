Footnotes
BUSY PAYNTER pressed the pace from outside to the lane, took over in upper stretch and kicked clear from MY SPY, then drew away in the final furlong.
FAMILY TRIPS bumped leaving the gate, stalked the top pair early, entered the lane two wide, drifted out and bumped WHERE'S FRANKIE past the
three-sixteenths pole and rallied for the place. WHERE'S FRANKIE broke a step slow on the outside, stalked outside a rival then spun three wide into the
stretch, got bumped by FAMILY TRIPS past the three-sixteenths pole and kept on for third. FULL OF GRACE was off slow in the beginning, angled down to
the inside and saved ground off the pace, earned a minor award but never threatened. MY SPY set the pace under pressure on the inside, maintained
command two wide to the stretch, gave up the lead in upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong. CA DREAMER lost her action and bumped inner rival
at the start, trailed three to four wide around the turn and failed to menace. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF CA DREAMER AND RULED
THAT SHE WAS AWARDED A FAIR START AND LOST HER ACTION LEAVING THE GATE AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER. THERE WAS ALSO A
STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE STRETCH RUN BETWEEN FAMILY TRIPS AND WHERE'S FRANKIE AND RULED THAT ALTHOUGH FAMILY
TRIPS DRIFTED OUT AND MADE CONTACT WITH WHERE'S FRANKIE IT DID NOT WARRANT A CHANGE IN THE ORDER OF FINISH.

Footnotes
BIG SHAMROCK brushed at the start, traveled in mid-pack early, closed in two wide then a bit off the rail into the stretch, bid inside the leaders cleared past
the three-sixteenths pole, then held safely through the final furlong. GLORIOUS SPRING was off a bit slow, saved ground near the back around the turn,
rallied along the fence and gained the place. SHE'S BULLETPROOF settled off the pace, went two wide then near the inside on the turn, angled out in the
stretch and finished willingly for third. BUSKER ALLIE was off slow to begin, trailed two then three wide on the turn, angled out in the lane and produced a
mild rally for fourth. GIANNA'S WILD CAT bumped in the beginning, was closest in pursuit up the backstretch, bid outside into the turn, four wide into the
stretch, fought to midstretch and weakened. WRONG TURN CUPID stalked the top pair from outside, rounded the bend four wide and flattened in the
stretch. BABY KRISTEN set the pace up the backstretch, met the bid from outside rival into the bend, led three wide into the stretch, lost command past the
three-sixteenths pole and gave way. SPANISH CHANNEL got sandwiched leaving the gate, took the turn four wide and never responded to urging.
STRAWBERRYONTOP broke in and bumped rival, chased two to three wide on the turn and had little left for the drive.

Footnotes
ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) set the pace under pressure from outside, cleared into the turn, opened up around the bend, roused with three-sixteenths
remaining and remained well clear to the wire under hand urging. STOP AND A TRES chased two to three wide, tipped out in the lane and finished
determinedly to best the others. TAKE CHARGE CURLY got crowded between rivals early, raced on the inside then eased off the rail around the turn,
steered out in the stretch and summoned a mild rally to gain the show. LAMPY tracked three deep into the turn, spun four wide into the stretch and could not
rally. BIG STICK coaxed between rivals then ceded the early lead, chased on the inside through the turn and lacked a rally. GOTCHA LOOKIN broke a step
slow, tracked four deep then five wide into the lane and could not rally. EXTRA INNINGS pressed the pace from outside early, could not keep up with the
winner on the turn, chased two wide into the lane, drifted in and fought the rider a bit when being corrected and weakened. MO CAPTAIN had his path taken
early and dropped back, rounded the bend four wide and was not a factor. PAT CAN'T COUNT tossed his head and came away very slow, trailed two wide
into the lane and could not make an impact. THE STEWARDS REVIEWED THE START OF PAT CAN'T COUNT AND RULED THAT HE COST HIS OWN
PROBLEMS AT THE START AND IS CONSIDERED A STARTER.

Footnotes
PRACTICAL MOVE raced up close between rivals into the first turn then dropped back a bit to a stalking position, launched a bid inside CARMEL ROAD at
the five-sixteenths pole, took over with a quarter mile remaining, shook free at the eight pole and drew away under right handed urging. CARMEL ROAD
sped to the front and led a bit off the rail into the clubhouse turn, showed the way clear up the backstretch, challenged by PRACTICAL MOVE at the
five-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead in upper stretch, stayed alongside to midstretch, lost touch into the final furlong but was clearly second best.
FORT BRAGG had to check out of a tight spot early, went two wide into the first turn then drifted out to the four path while at the back, moved closer three
deep on the far turn, could not sustain the momentum in upper stretch and churned on to hold the show. TALL BOY bumped leaving the gate, stalked on the
inside, swung out at the five-sixteenths pole and could not rally. ARABIAN LION was up close three deep into the first turn, closest in pursuit up the
backstretch, lost positions while coaxed along on the far turn in the two path, then faded in the stretch run.

Footnotes
TROJAN WAY dueled for the lead from inside then cleared on the backstretch, led a bit off the rail into the lane, drew away under urging in upper stretch
and held safely in the end. SHEZ OUR ARCH settled in the two path early, angled in on the far turn, summoned a mild rally for second but could not
threaten the winner. PARCO dueled for command from outside on the first turn then pressed around the bend, was closest in pursuit into and around the far
turn, spun three wide into the lane and never produced a bid. SUPERCENTS settled inside, angled five wide on the far turn and kept on to round out the
superfecta. COMPTONS HOUSE was off slow and broke out, tucked inside at the back, went two wide into the far turn, eased out and came four wide into
the stretch, steered out further in the lane and improved position. CLEARANCE showed early speed three deep then drifted out and bumped rival on the first
turn, tracked three deep into the second bend, drifted out and bumped rival leaving the far turn and tired. MARGOT went four wide into the first turn outside
a rival, moved down to the two path, continued two wide into the lane and failed to menace. ITALIAN LOVE SONG was a bit rank early into the first turn
while three wide, steered down to the rail around the bend, raced inside rivals into the second bend, dropped back and tired. AWSOME DONNA got carried
wide and bumped on the first turn, started to weaken after the halfway point, eased into the stretch and down the lane and walked off.

Footnotes
KEEP YOUR COIL bumped leaving the gate, stalked two wide leaving the backstretch, angled in on the turn, rallied inside the leaders and took over past
the eight pole and drove clear. KAELY'S CANDY bumped at the start, set the pace inside a pair of rivals, cleared two wide into the stretch, relinquished the
lead past the eight pole and stayed on to save the place. ENSLEYS DREAM attended the pace three deep early, spun four wide into the lane, lacked the
needed late kick and was denied the place honors. LUCY L bumped in the beginning, settled inside, came two wide into the stretch, moved out in the drive
and summoned a mild rally. BONITA LEONA sat off the pace, went three wide into the turn, swung seven wide leaving the bend and kept on to improve.
ROSES R BLUE was fractious in the gate, came away slow, traveled four wide into the turn, angled down to the two path, weaved through traffic in the lane
and improved position. NAP TIME chased three wide into the turn, drifted five wide into the stretch and could not rally. SHVERE ARBETER bumped leaving
the gate, lost his path early and dropped back, went three wide into the turn, exited the bend five wide, was bothered from inside and steadied in upper
stretch and could not rally. TRIP TO FREEDOM pressed the pace from between rivals, came three wide into the lane and weakened. BLAME IT ON ROSE
stalked four wide into the turn, got floated six wide into the lane, was forced to check between rivals in midstretch and faded.

Footnotes
SETTECENTO pressed the pace from outside, dueled around the far turn, led into the stretch, disposed of QUICK INTRO outside the three-sixteenths pole,
then met the challenge from SO I'M TOLD and held gamely to the wire. SO I'M TOLD rated three wide early, took aim three then two wide into the stretch,
bid from outside with three-sixteenths to go but could not get by. SIPPIN N KISSIN chased three wide around the first turn, between leaving the backstretch,
entered the lane four wide, rallied outside the top pair in the final furlong but failed to find the needed late kick. SITTIN ON GO broke a step slow, trailed into
the first turn, pulled on the first turn and earl on the backstretch, exited the far turn three wide, moved out in the lane and improved position. QUICK INTRO
took control early from inside, dueled around the far turn, lost command leaving the bend, fought to upper stretch and weakened in the final furlong.
HOODLUM rated two wide then moved inside, asked two wide into the stretch and weakened. ECONOMICAL tracked four wide around the first turn, went
two then three wide on the far turn, moved out in the stretch and failed to menace. CARELESS KITTEN chased five then four wide on the first turn, three to
four wide on the second bend and had little left for the stretch run.

through the turn, angled out midstretch and gained ground on the winner late. TIGER SPICE set the pace under pressure from outside, dueled along the rail
through the turn, lost command at the three-sixteenths pole and flattened to third. SHANGHAI SUNRISE chased two wide into the turn, between rivals then
four wide into the lane and weakened. LA AGUILILLA stalked on the inside, eased off the rail and entered the lane three wide and never responded to
urging. SQUARE TOMATOES bumped at the start, stalked the top pair from outside, traveled three deep on the turn then came five wide into the stretch
and tired. FLYING TO THE LINE bumped leaving the gate, raced at the back outside rival then came three wide into the stretch and had little left for the

Footnotes
DOC ADAMS chased two wide early, raced along the rail into the far turn, angled out around the bend, closed well from outside and drove clear in the final
sixteenth. BEEF WINSLOW vied between around the first turn then rated outside the pacesetter, applied pressure leaving the backstretch, vied between on
the far turn, led into the stretch, kicked clear in upper stretch and got run down in the final sixteenth. DURANTE showed early speed four deep into the first
turn then dropped back to stalk, bid three deep on the far turn, could not keep up with the leader in upper stretch and stayed on to hold the show. FINNEUS
bumped leaving the gate, was along the three path on the first turn off the pace, had to check between runners at the five-eighths pole, angled six wide
leaving the far turn and finished willingly to round out the superfecta. NILES CHANNEL vied for the lead into the first turn, cleared into the backstretch, got
pressured nearing the far turn, fought with outer rivals to the stretch and flattened in the late stages. SHOW TIME bumped at the start, saved ground near
the back to the stretch and could not rally. SHORTMAN was off slow and lost path to begin, went three to four wide around the first turn, traveled four deep
into the second bend, came six wide into the stretch and failed to menace. HIGH HEATER tracked three wide early, continued off the rail to the far turn,
came four to five wide into the stretch and never threatened. NO HANG CHARLIE vied three deep on the first turn, dropped back to stalk the leader outside
a rival, lost ground through the far turn, eased in the final furlong and walked off. SAVILE ROW was off slow to begin, raced wide through the first turn,
widest up the backstretch, came four wide into the lane, had little left and was eased to the wire and walked off.
