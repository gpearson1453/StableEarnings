Footnotes
WILDWOOD DREAMER pressed the early pace from the inside, took command through the far turn and drew off to be well clear under steady pressure
while racing near the rail. J J'S SOLUTION settled off the early going to race near the back of the pack early on, moved up five to six wide into the upper
stretch and made a good late rally to get up for the place position. DASH TO THE CASH settled off the early going, angled widest through the lane to race
from the outside and moved up late to improve position. KISS N BIZ prompt the early pace while racing three deep from the outside of foes and weakened.
SMOOTH ATTACK showed good early foot to set the early pace while racing between rivals and weakened the final eighth of a mile. NAGY AND DA
BEARS raced mid pack early on, was near the inside around the far turn, angled out and had no late rally. ROCKET MAN ATTACK stalked the pace, raced
three wide past the quarter pole and was empty in the drive.

the far turn, shifted out four wide through the drive and finished gamely to the wire. PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN settled to race mid pack early on, moved up
four to five wide around the far turn and made a good late gain deep stretch while racing from the outside of foes. ROCKET HOTSHOT was slow early,
raced along the rail into the upper stretch, waited for racing room near the three sixteenths pole, found room and had no late run with an even finish. LOOK
AWAY race mid pack early on, was near the inside around the far turn and lacked a bid. SPALDING STROLL stalked the pace while racing four wide from

Footnotes
DUST DANCER dueled for the early lead from the outside of foe and finished well to get up under strong handling. DEMAND RANSOM stalked the place
near the inside, raced four deep near the three sixteenths place and got up for the place position late. COMING UP ACES settled off the early pace, made
an advance through the far turn, raced two to three wide between rivals in the stretch and finished willingly to the wire. SENOR MIKE dueled for the early
lead from the inside and weakened the final eighth of a mile. DEORA STORE was off slowly, void of early speed and moved up late while racing five wide.
EMPTY HOLSTER race mid pack early on, was five to six wide into the upper stretch and lacked a bid. CYCLONE ATTACK chased the early pace while
racing three wide and tired.

pressed the early pace from the outside of foe and kept to finish willingly to the wire. TU ROYAL showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside
and gave way grudgingly. DOMINIQUE was reluctant to load, raced off the early pace, was six deep near the three sixteenths pole, shifted in through the
stretch and kept on to the wire. ARRINGTON raced mid pack early on, was two wide past the quarter pole and flattened out. LIL CARRIE D rated along
early on, raced four wide around the far turn and had no final winning bid. JOYZELLA raced with the second flight early on, was three to four wide in the

Footnotes
SIVAKO was bumped at the start, rated along early on, raced near the inside nearing the quarter pole, shifted four wide and finished well to draw clear
under steady handling. FEVER NATION showed good early speed along the inside, pressured into the far turn and was no match for the winner late.
SLAVA UKRAINI was reluctant to load, raced two deep past the quarter pole, raced five wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. ALL
ABOUT CROGE pressed the early leader from the outside and weakened in the drive. STAR NATION was reluctant to load, raced near the back early on,
moved up five wide in the stretch and improved position. BORN ON FIRE was bumped at the start, raced near the inside in the stretch run and raced evenly
with no closing bid. RUSSIAN HAMMER was bumped, took up at the start, raced off the early pace, fanned wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally
while racing from the outside. EL MUCHO was bumped, squeezed back at the start, raced three deep near the quarter pole, angled out to race wide through
the upper stretch and never threatened. AMERICAN MOON was reluctant to load, bumped at the start, raced with the second flight and never threatened.
JAKES CHANNEL dropped back early, raced near the inside and never was a factor. RICKY'S BEST took up at the break, raced far back and never
threatened.

willingly to the wire. BALADINE dropped back early, moved up from the outside and close din belatedly. HURTS SO BAD raced mid pack early, was three to
four wide in the lane and made a mild late gain. LAKE MILLS was unhurried early on, raced six deep near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally.
BASEBALL POLITICS stalked the pace and faded while racing along the inside. CHEEKERS was reluctant to load, chased the pace from the inside and

RUNNERS HEAT pressed the early leader from the outside and just got up under all out pressure. MUD HUT showed good early speed to set the pace
along the inside and finished gamely to the wire. QUEEN EKATI raced off the early pace, moved up four to five wide in the stretch and improve position.
FRIEND stalked the pace, raced five deep near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. BELLS OF JOY chased the pace from the inside and had
not enough in the drive. MORNING LINE NEWS settled off the early pace, raced six to seven wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. MAIDEN
ROCK raced mid pack early on, was near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid. NOT TO BE DENIED dropped back early and
failed to respond. AIR WALKER was off very slow and trailed.
