marker and edged away late. CAUSES TROUBLE stalked the pacesetters, bid three wide at the quarter pole, dueled in upper stretch, dug in gamely outside
in the final furlong and came up second best. SHARP SENSATION vied three wide for the early lead, dueled between rivals in upper stretch, stayed on and
earned the show spot. ALMOND CIDER vied inside for the lead, dueled into the stretch, dug in and weakened late. ALIGNMENT was outrun early,
advanced on the turn, checked when lacking room at the quarter pole, then closed well late inside. SIR CUPID was outrun early, advanced on the turn and
closed belatedly. FULL CONTACT raced off the rail, off the pace and failed to threaten. GERRYS MAGIC MAP vied between rivals for command, chased on

moved closer outside before half a mile, continued willingly but could not get by the winner. SAINT MARCO moved strongly along the rail into the far turn,
was taken up sharply, angled out and lacked further response. SOUL PROVIDER prompted the winner for half a mile and faltered. AUSTIN WHYLIE
dropped far behind, bore out on the final turn and trailed then was eased in the late stages. The stewards posted an inquiry into the incident at the far turn,
An objection by the rider of the third finisher against the rider of the winner for interference into the far turn was denied.

Footnotes
I CROSS MY HEART raced off the pace inside, advanced two wide on the turn, angled inward in upper stretch, rallied on the rail, closed willingly, charged
to the front past the sixteenth marker and drew clear. JEZEBEL JADE raced off the pace inside, advanced on the turn, came three wide into the lane, rallied
outside and finished well for second. EMPRESS DEONA dueled two wide for the lead, took over on the turn, drew clear, dug in, weakened in the final
furlong and held on for third. OFFALY FAST chased two wide and closed belatedly on the rail in the stretch. OUR UPTOWN GIRL raced off the pace,
advanced three wide on the turn and lacked a stretch rally. AKEMI dueled inside of EMPRESS DEONA with that pair opening up on the field, chased that
rival on the turn and faded. XENATOWN raced two wide off the pace and did not factor. DEBBIE'S SURPRISE chased on the inside, chased on the turn
and gave way. TIZITA raced inside and was outrun.

SNOW FORECAST stalked the loose leader in the two path, took over into the stretch and quickly drew away while kept to her task. SIZZLING ROMA
outrun early, advanced on the turn and closed well while no match for the winner. LOVE ON FIRE raced off the pace just off the inside and continued well.
REITERATE urged just off the pace three wide and weakened slightly late. WALK ME HOME dropped back early, moved inside on the turn passing rivals
but was no threat. NOTHINS FREE hustled close up inside then began fading on the turn. BOCA ROYALTY trailed early then passed rivals without
menacing. IMPERIAL MOON set a clear pace along the inside and stopped through the stretch. MAGICAL ANNA was in tight at the break then raced wide
and faded. B B'S ROCKET lacked speed and faded steadily inside. FAST INTENTIONS chased four wide down the backstretch and gave way readily.

PASSIONATE DREAM tracked on the inside, then two wide, bid two wide on the far turn, led into the lane, responded when roused and drew clear in the
final furlong. TEMPTED TO TOUCH stumbled at the start, trailed the field, made a strong four wide run on the far turn, bid at the quarter pole, dug in gamely
but second best. FLIGHT raced off the pace inside, moved up three wide on the far turn, rallied between rivals in upper stretch and was outkicked.
SIRENETTA raced four wide early, settled off the rail, off the pace, chased the leaders on the far turn and tired. OLD HEAD raced five wide early, angled in
on the first turn, set the pace in the two path, shook free, dueled inside on the far turn and tired. ELEVENMONTHSLATER steadied behind OLD HEAD on
the first turn, vied inside, then tracked inside, chased on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
LONG LEGGED BOY pursued the pacesetters inside, angled out near the five sixteenths pole and drew off under a drive. CUMULUS outrun early,
advanced wide and was up for the show late. IT'S A PITY chased leader outside, took over at the quarter pole then weakened in the stretch. HOLY PANTS
stumbled at the start, rushed to a clear advantage then proved empty in the stretch. FRUGAL JUDE lagged far behind then passed fading rivals. PER KEY
D P saved ground off the pace and weakened steadily. DESPEIGHT FORTUNE lacked speed racing wide and was never in contention.

the pacesetters outside then closed well with steady gain just missing. TEXAS TANGIE saved ground off the leaders and rallied late to gain the show while
no threat. EXPECTATIONS MET pursued the winner outside, held a narrow lead at the quarter pole then weakened. CHERU chased three wide down the
backstretch and lacked a rally. CAPE NEDDICK broke slowest and dropped far behind and was never a factor. AZTEC BAY lacked speed and gave way
readily. BOUNTY KILLAH raced very wide and stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
BRETT'S WORLD stalked close up three wide, then pressed the pace, took over entering the far turn, pulled away, responded when roused and was ridden
out through the lane. HOLDTHEFLIGHT raced off the pace, moved up outside past the half mile marker, went four wide on the far turn and rallied for
second. CURLIN'S THRILL raced off the pace, advanced three wide on the far turn, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. IT'S GAME TIME
raced off the pace, advanced on the far turn, raced inside in the stretch and bested the others. HIBACHI raced three wide early, then stalked outside, bid
three wide on the far turn and weakened. DECKOLOGY tracked on the inside, chased inside on the far turn and faded. COLONEL JUAN stalked close up
between rivals, chased on the far turn and gave way. DISTRACTANDATTACK stumbled badly at the start causing the rider to briefly lose the irons,
recovered, then was outrun, dropped far back and jogged home. STORMY BONNIE set the pace on the inside, stopped on the far turn and jogged home.
After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, the race was declared official.
