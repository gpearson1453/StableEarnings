Footnotes
IDRATHERBEBLESSED off a bit slow, began a three wide advance into the far turn, took over entering the stretch and drove steadily clear. CAMBIASO
lacked early foot, rallied three wide into the stretch, ran on to finish clear for the place, no real threat to the winner. BREAD WINNER broke back, lacked
early foot just off the inside, advanced while steering out four wide midway on the second turn, chased the winner past the furlong maker, flattened out and
was caught for the place. PRINCE OF ROSES chased the leader off the rail, dropped to the inside midway on the final turn, came up empty for the drive.
JOHNNY'S MOMENT remained back in lacking a closing response. RANSAM PAYNTER sprinted well clear soon after the start, extended advantage
backstretch, stopped second turn.

Footnotes
NINJA WARRIOR broke out to help tighten up SUMMER IN MALIBU, was straightened to clear before a quarter, saw that advantage shrink through the
turn, regained a daylight advantage with straightened for home, won geared down late to be ridden out. OLLIEMEISTER lacked early foot, three wide and in
some traffic late in the turn, rallied well wide through the stretch to finish willingly, clearly second best. COLD AS HELL chased the winner in the two path,
remained closest to that one through upper stretch, no match for that one or the runner up late. BRAWNDO in the second flight while racing three wide,
came up empty for the drive. PISTOL OR SHOTGUN in mid pack while inside, continued to save ground through the turn, failed to muster a rally when
called on for the drive. SUMMER IN MALIBU squeezed back to be off slowly, moved closer four wide through the turn, had little left. CATHEDRAL BEACH
broke in to contribute to SUMMER IN MALIBU being squeezed, fell back to trail after the start, was never close and showed little.

Footnotes
REUP behind the lead pack outside, closer four wide turn, hooked up with the runner up for an extended stretch duel, wore that foe down under steady
handling. ATTA PARTY with the pace from the start, vied between rivals through the turn, shook off those rivals as he was being joined by the winner, raced
on equal terms with the winner inside that one past the furlong marker, gave ground grudgingly to the winner, clearly second best. HEART HEADED ARKY
behind the first flight up the backstretch four wide, continued to lay off that group through the turn, one paced stretch to finish up best of the rest. ALL IN
GOOD TIME with the pace along the inside, weakened through the stretch. FETCHS BRAHM off a step slow, outrun early, four wide through the turn,
improved position down the stretch while not posing a serious threat. ROYAL DE BE in mid pack inside, steered out a bit midway on the turn, went one
paced through the stretch in lacking a closing. TOMMY TRI off a step slow, trailed for over a half, passed some tiring rivals while also not a serious threat.
COLONEL BARTON moved up to contest the pace while three wide for a half, gave way from between rivals turning for home. PERIPATETIC off slowly,
remained always back. DABOOGEYMAN off a step slow, was finished early. PREACHER'S PET in mid pack early, dropped inside turn, backed up through
the lane.

Footnotes
GET THROUGH lacked early foot while three wide first turn, continued outside and advanced four to five wide into the lane, lugged in while rallying
midstretch, was straightened and finished up with good determination to be in time. ABSOLUTE COURAGE broke on top, angled toward the inside into the
first turn, continued to show the way middle half, turned back a couple of rivals turning for home to be clear again, could not contain the winner while inside
that one at the wire. CYCLONE forwardly placed early inside, moved out a bit and advanced to challenge outside the leader and between horses second
turn, failed to sustain that effort through the stretch. JEDREK void of speed while three wide first turn, raced three wide through the second turn, displayed a
modest amount of late interest to improve position, missed the show. MAJESTIC FLAG steadied into the first turn behind the pace, three wide and
advanced to briefly challenge late in the final turn, hung in the drive. BOURBON ON FIRE void of speed, in some traffic while remaining back turning into the
stretch, failed to rally when clear for the drive. KOSELIO in mid pack, tired after six furlongs along the inside. FIVE O FOX broke out, four wide in the first
turn when with the leader, continued well wide, pulled up far turn, walked off.

Footnotes
MACHO RONNIE broke alertly, cleared toward the inside, pace, shrugged off closest pursuer turning for home, drew off, ridden out. LORD M moved up to
chase the winner up the backstretch and into the turn, moved a bit closer late in the turn then proved no match through the stretch, clearly second best.
BOTANY well back off the pace, raced four wide through the turn, rallied mildly to be in time for the show. SUPER GEEK broke back, raced in the two path
when well off the issue through the turn, split foes nearing the furlong grounds, improved position. RISKY SITUATION in mid pack early, moved closer in
some traffic through the turn then flattened out in the drive. SERBIAN SAILOR void of speed, saved ground through most of the turn, angled out three wide
entering the stretch and improved position. DEPART mid pack while well wide up the backstretch, six wide into the bend, worked way down to the four path
with a quarter remaining and began to tire.. TALE OF TRUTH dwelt at the start to spot the field a few lengths, raced five wide through the turn and had little
left. WARNING LABEL within striking distance three wide, backed up in the drive. MORNING DRIVE dwelt at the start, remained back. DRIVER forwardly
placed early, began a steady retreat before a half. LOU'S ARROW lacked speed outside, five wide and between foes into the turn, steadied when in tight,
fell back and trailed home.

Footnotes
TIPSY GAL cleared after the start, set all the pace toward the inside, not threatened through the lane under token encouragement. LA MORENA lacked
speed, raced three out to four wide through the turn when advancing through the turn, proved game for the place, no threat to the winner. STANLEY
MARKET in the second flight outside, three wide through the turn when moving a bit closer, chased the winner upper stretch, outkicked for the second spot,
return bleeding. CHASING SHADOWS last to leave, angled out four wide turning for home, staged a mild rally out in the strip to improve position. DORITA'S
HEART lacked speed toward the inside, floated out five wide turning into the stretch, also improved position with some mild interest. CARELESS HEIRESS
in mid pack just off the inside, steadied in some traffic midway on the turn, went evenly when clear for the drive. SIMONA'S CHOICE remained back in
lacking a response. HOUSE WRECKER chased the winner for a half and gave way. DAWNLAND away well, raced briefly forward, stopped in the turn,
jogged in far back.

Footnotes
KATTATH pressed the issue for over five furlongs, outside bid three wide midway on the final turn, took over turning for home, spirited duel the final furlong,
dug in late to prevail in game fashion. CARNIVORE unhurried in the early going while saving ground, moved out, advanced three to four wide second turn,
challenged outside the winner nearing midstretch, dueled to the wire, outgamed in the final strides. EXTRAVAGATE void of speed, advanced four and five
wide second turn, could do little with the top two the final furlong, well clear of the others. BRESLAU with the pace off the inside, vied between foes when
holding a narrow advantage, weakened in the drive. CENTURION angled in a bit first turn to race in the two path, continued back, two path again second
turn, improved position. COASTAL CHAOS turned in a one paced effort from the two path. PAID IN FULL narrowly showed the way early, vied inside the
middle half mile, gave way. TROUBADOUR in mid pack early, faded while four wide through the final turn. AIN'T THAT A KICK off slowly, was finished
early.

Footnotes
ASH FLAT in the second flight outside, closer four wide turn, set down into the stretch, closed with good resolve to be up in time. VULCAN dueled up front
off the inside, shook clear in the turn, maintained a daylight advantage past midstretch, nailed in the final strides. AMERICAN PURE in mid pack outside,
four to five wide out of the turn, closed some ground late outside the top two but was left with too much to do. BEER CHASER lacked speed, steered out
from well back to be widest for the drive, also found best stride too late. EMERALD EXPRESS off a step slow, raced back, four wide through much of the
turn, improved upper stretch, came up flat late. MANUELITO turned in a one paced effort while racing toward the inside. RIBBONS AND MEDALS in mid
pack off the inside, four wide in traffic late in the turn, lacked rally when clear. FREUDIAN FATE prompted the issue from the two path and the second flight
early, tired in the drive. CHAPEL BARN dueled up front inside the winner for three furlongs, gave way. THAT KHENNY five wide trip was never close.
ROLLING FORK remained always back. ANGKOR staged a steady retreat three wide.

Footnotes
SUNNY ISLE BEACH allowed the pace to go early, continued to race unhurried up the backstretch toward the inside, closer, waited in traffic midway on the
final turn, steered out three wide, challenged into the lane, edged clear, held late. LET'S DUET void of speed, asked along, angled out in some traffic four
wide turning for home, finished willingly to be well clear for the second spot. PRETTI XTREME void of speed, continued back, advanced in the two path
through some traffic second turn, clear into the lane, mild rally to finish up best of the rest, no match for the top two. ENCHANTED NILE in the second flight
just off the inside, moved to challenge in the second turn, flattened out in the drive. I FEEL THE NEED off a step slow, void of speed, angled out three wide
turning for home, showed some belated interest to improve position. LANDSLID bumped at the break, mid pack off the inside, fanned six wide into the lane,
also improved position with some mild late energy. HOPING FOR A RING in mid pack while racing in the three path, encountered some traffic far turn, failed
to produce a rally when clear for the drive. WATERWORKS pressed the leader off the inside and between horses early, put a head in front midway on the
final turn while continuing between horses, faltered in the drive. MO CLASSY second group while four wide into the first turn, four wide again second, had
little left for the drive. PYRAMID PRINCESS off a step slow, bumped, remained back. COMEDY ACT set or forced the pace along the inside, gave way.
LEGENDARY GIFT five wide into the first turn, finished after a half.
