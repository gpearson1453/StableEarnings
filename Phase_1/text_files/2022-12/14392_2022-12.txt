Footnotes
FLAME RIDER sped clear and showed the way up the backstretch, led two wide around the turn, drifted into the lane, continued to drifted further through
the drive while comfortably entering the final furlong and held safely. MENTIROSA chased along the inside into the turn, angled out and raced three to four
wide into the stretch, summoned a mild rally to earn the place but could not reach the winner. LET HIM DO settled off the pace, took the turn three then four
wide, drifted inward in the lane and kept on to gain the show. HUMBLEBUMBLEFUMBLE got bumped hard from outside in the beginning, raced off the
pace, angled in on the turn, steered out in the stretch and failed to threaten. MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING veered in and bumped inner rivals at the start, stalked
three wide into the turn, steered to the rail around the bend and weakened. EARLY RELEASE broke a slow, got bumped and impeded at the start, trailed
four wide into the turn, came five wide into the stretch and never got involved. QUARTER- AND HALF-MILE TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

turn, chased five wide into the bend then angled down to the three path, moved closer between rivals on the backstretch, coaxed outside a rival two wide on
the far turn and lacked a late bid. IVORY SKY tracked six wide into the first turn then moved into the five path, left the backstretch four deep, remained wide

DANZING ROAD stalked the leader from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, switched to the outside of the top pair in the lane, engaged the duo
past the eighth pole and drove clear. MERCY NOW got bumped at the start, chased early then bid three deep and four wide on the turn, lugged inward and
took over at the three-sixteenths pole, relinquished the lead back to DADS WISH near the eighth pole, had the rider lose his whip outside the sixteenth pole
and finished willingly for the place. DADS WISH took control early, led in the two path around the turn while being pressured, was overtaken in upper
stretch, regained the lead with a furlong left to run but faltered late and was able to hold the show. ANACARAVA (IRE) settled inside, angled out on the turn
and came four wide into the stretch, put in a late run and earned a minor award. RUNAWAY SALLY broke out and bumped rival, tracked three wide through
the turn and lacked further response. ONLY LIGHTNING dropped back early, went five wide into the turn, moved into the four path then lugged out into the
stretch and was not a factor. PAT'S LUCY broke a step slow, tracked two wide then along the rail and faded. HARD BUT SMART broke a step slow, raced
near the back early, went three then four wide on the turn and came up empty in the lane.

Footnotes
HIGHLY DISTORTED bumped leaving the gate, chased three then four wide on the turn, rallied three deep in the furlong grounds, took a narrow lead at the
sixteenth pole and dug in to hold the runner-up at bay. ALEXANDER'S DREAM chased on the inside then two wide into the stretch, rallied inside a pair of
rivals and could not get by HIGHLY DISTORTED in the final sixteenth. SWAMP'N AIN'T EZ hopped at the start then went up to clear the field, crossed over
into the two path, led three wide into the lane, continued clear into the final furlong and yielded in the final sixteenth. UNCLE WILBUR bumped leaving the
gate, tracked outside a rival out of range, entered the stretch four to five wide and failed to threaten. DERBY STORM trailed near the inside early on, went
two wide into the turn, angled out leaving the bend and was not a factor. COUNT TOLSTOY sat off the pace three wide and lacked a rally.

NICE GUY CLAY broke inward to bother rival, pressed the pace between early, took over into the turn, led three wide into the stretch, moved clear of
CHIPPER in the lane and drew away. CHIPPER stalked the pace on the inside, angled four wide around the turn, put in a mild bid from outside but was no
match for the winner. FIREMAN DAN stalked off the rail, rounded the bend to wide, moved out in the lane and kept on for third. SUPER CLASSIC raced
near the back early on, took the turn three wide and improved position. MITICO took control early from inside, lost the lead into the turn, stayed alongside
the leader through the bend, then weakened down the lane. GRANADA FLAVOR was off slow and bothered leaving the gate, trailed up the backstretch,
went four wide into the turn, exited the bend seven wide and was not a factor. HOOP DREAM was up close early outside the top trio, lost ground and came
six wide into the lane and weakened. MAYNARD attended the pace three deep, chased three then four wide around the turn and faded.

GILMORE steadied between rivals early then was rated two to three wide, bid outside the leader with three furlongs remaining, took over midstretch and
kicked clear to win going away. ROLL ON BIG JOE sped to the front and moved into the two path, padded lead in the middle stages, met the bid from
GILMORE at the three-eighths pole, dueled into the stretch, relinquished the lead midstretch and stayed on to secure second. MONGOLIAN ALTAI was off
slow to begin, tucked inside on the first turn, went three wide into the far turn, came five wide into the stretch, lugged in and bumped LOCO LUNA in the final
sixteenth and gained the show. EXCEL CALCULATOR was off slow to begin, trailed two wide early, rounded the far turn five then four wide, drifted in and
out in the lane and was along for a minor award. LOCO LUNA forwardly placed in the early going three wide, came four wide into the stretch, got bumped at
the sixteenth pole and flattened. ICE STORM chased four wide on the clubhouse turn, stayed four wide into the second turn, angled in a few paths then
steered back out into the stretch and lacked further response. DONTTESTYOURLUCK chased three wide into the first turn then started to climb around the
bend and into the backstretch, went four wide into the second bend then angled down to the two path and failed to menace. BLUEGRASS LUTE stalked on
the inside, moved out and entered the lane two to three wide and came up empty. LORD MO chased five wide around the first turn, started to drop back
approaching the half-mile pole, eased into and around the far turn, coasted through the stretch and walked off.

Footnotes
TALKATIVE GAL was closest in pursuit from outside, took aim three wide into the stretch, took over past the three-sixteenths pole and drew off to win going
away. ARDIS set the pace up the backstretch, led along the rail then two wide into the drive, challenged in upper stretch and clung to a narrow lead at the
three-sixteenths pole, then relinquished command to TALKATIVE GAL and stayed on for a clear second. EVERLYS GIRL tracked the pacesetter three wide
into the turn, came four wide into the stretch and never found the needed response. SANGRE AZUL chased on the inside into the turn, eased out to three
path leaving the bend, moved out further in the stretch and lacked a late bid.

Footnotes
FAIZA got bumped from outside at the start, stalked three wide early, bid four deep on the far turn and three deep into the stretch, brushed with inner rival at
the quarter pole, took over shortly after, drifted in while battling with PRIDE OF THE NILE and gamely prevailed. PRIDE OF THE NILE stumbled badly,
broke in and bumped, raced along the three path settling off the pace, moved into range in the middle stages, angled in and launched a bid from inside on
the far turn, took over into the stretch, came out and bumped DOINITTHEHARDWAY at the quarter pole then bumped again with that rival at the
three-sixteenths marker, fought gamely inside FAIZA through the final furlong but could not get by. UNCONTROLLABLE got bumped on both sides at the
start, angled to the inside racing at the back early, saved ground around the far turn, steered out in the lane and gained the show honors.
DOINITTHEHARDWAY dueled for command inside CLASSYMADEMOISELLE early, moved out on the backstretch then inched ahead, held command
through the far turn then vied between leaving the bend, relinquished the lead entering the stretch, got bumped on both sides at the quarter pole, bumped
with PRIDE OF THE NILE at the three-sixteenths marker and weakened in the late stages. BLESSED TOUCH hit the gate at the start, tracked four then five
wide on the clubhouse turn, traveled three wide into the second bend, moved out to the five path then raced four wide into the lane and lacked the needed
response. CLASSYMADEMOISELLE went up to duel for command from outside, kept the pressure on up the backstretch, vied three deep at the
five-sixteenths pole, chased the leaders three wide into the stretch and faded through the lane. THERE WAS A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INVOLVING THE
INCIDENT AT THE QUARTER POLE AND FOLLOWING A REVIEW RULED THAT ALTHOUGH PRIDE OF THE NILE CAME OUT AND MADE CONTACT
WITH DOINITTHEHARDWAY, IT DID NOT WARRANT A DISQUALIFICATION AND NO CHANGE WOULD BE MADE.
