Footnotes
BENOIT went three to four wide into the first turn then tracked the leaders from three wide on the backstretch, was four wide into the upper stretch and
drove clear under light urging. MOR BIG LEE pressed the pace from the two path, took the lead at the quarter pole then was headed at the sixteenth pole
and proved second best. MANGUM was positioned off the pace and off the rail, was coaxed at the quarter pole but was no match for the top two and gave a
game effort. A MILLION STARS was allowed to settle around the first turn then moved up slightly on the backstretch but had no late bid. A'DEBRIS set a
pressured early pace from the inside to the quarter pole and tired in the drive. GRAEME'S DEAL was outrun.

turn to take the lead at the three sixteenths pole and drew off. DOUBLE PRIORITY stalked the pace from the three path, was coaxed at the three eighths
pole going four wide on the final turn and got up late for the place. MONITOR MILLS was hustled to a clear lead to the final turn then was caught at the
three sixteenths pole and tired. MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT was bumped by WAR ZONG at the start, unhurried to the final turn made a three wide bid for a
late rally. PROUDTOWN raced in the middle of the pack on the inside and passed tiring rivals in the stretch. C. F. CONGRESS was placed in the middle of
the pack from three wide to the final turn made a bid on the turn but faltered. LOWER CRETACEOUS tracked the leaders from the two path for a half and
slowly retreated. A STAR IS BORN NOW went four wide into the first turn while racing wide throughout and was never a threat. WAR ZONG broke out and
bumped MISCHEVIOUS ROBERT at the start, then chased the leaders for a half and stopped, walked off.

Footnotes
CATINANDSCATIN went to the clear lead and set the pace throughout to prove much the best. BELLA'S GATSBY settled in the middle of the pack from
three wide around the first turn then moved up from four wide on the backstretch, dueled around the final turn, drifted in during the stretch drive and held the
place. MIDNIGHT OIL tracked the leaders from the inside to the final turn then dueled around the final turn, was in tight in mid stretch but fought gamely to
the wire. SWEET PRESENT was void of the early speed to the final turn made a three to four wide bid to give a late effort. SHOETRICK was off the pace in
the three path and retreated. WHEELS TURNING was allowed to settle but was never a threat. LONG WARRIOR was close up in the two path to the three
eighths pole and stopped. JOCKEY OF MIDNIGHT OIL CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST JOCKEY OF BELLA'S GATSBY FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE IN
THE STRETCH, AFTER A STEWARDS REVIEW THE CLAIM OF FOUL WAS DISALLOWED.

CASHEW stalked the pace from the three path was coaxed to talk the lead at the quarter pole, was three to four wide in upper stretch and drew off. CABO
SUNSET saved ground through the final turn moved out to two wide in upper stretch, moved out to three wide at the sixteenth pole moving between horses
to prove second best. SARATOGA KAREN was void of the early speed, steadily advanced from the two path, was four wide at the sixteenth pole to improve
position. TIME TO SLEEP had a pressured lead to the quarter pole and gave way. MY LITTLE GUERA pressed the pace from the two path for a half and
weakened. MISS MIRACLE GIRL was placed off the pace but was not a threat. ST MARIA was four wide into the first turn and was always near the back.

in the two path, went four wide in upper stretch for a late rally and missed the place. TIME TO CLOSE was checked shortly after the start then made a rail
bid and faltered. TALKATIVE was near the back to the turn made a three wide bid on the turn while steadily gaining and missed the show. BELL PEPPER
