BARISTA VIXEN was rated along in the early stages, moved up two wide near the quarter pole and finished well to edge clear while racing four to five wide
under strong handling. MS STRONG HEART showed good early speed to set the early pace, was collared nearing the eighth pole and kept on while racing
from the inside to be second best. MY DIXIE LASS stalked the early pace, raced from the inside near the three eighths pole, was four deep near the three
sixteenths pole and had not enough for the top pair. TWEET AWAY ROBIN broke in the air, tracked the top pair down the backstretch, raced four wide near
the quarter pole and raced evenly with no final run. MIKEY'S JEWEL was void of early speed, raced four wide into the upper stretch and never threatened.
COLLIN'S GREY LADY tracked the pace while racing two wide, hard ridden nearing the three eighths pole and tired.
