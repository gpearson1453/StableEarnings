Footnotes
ONEMORANDTHECHECK angled in nearing the first turn, prompted the pace two wide for a half, made the lead, shook clear under left handed urging in
mid stretch and lasted under a hand ride. FLOCKED set the early pace along the inside, kept pressure on the winner into the far turn, steadied a bit past the
five sixteenths pole then came on again two wide in a game effort. BLUNDER well placed, offered a mild bid three wide on the far turn then leveled off.
ZINFATUATION failed to menace. BUILT LIKE TARZAN checked inside the winner nearing the first turn and was through after a half.

the pace until deep stretch, drifted out to the five path under left handed urging and just missed hanging on. SKY never far back, was forced inward near the
sixteenth marker and was steadily gaining ground late. A SMILE A DAY stalked the pace outside in the six path, moved closer on the turn, drifted into the
two path in deep stretch and was outfinished. BLONDE BY NATURE failed to menace. SIERRA DIAMOND chased the pace along the inside into the

Footnotes
ELLIOT THE DRAGON stalked the pace four wide, responded readily when set down, made the lead near the furlong marker and proved best under left
handed urging. TEAM LEYENDECKER unhurried early, closed with a burst of speed in the six path through the stretch and got up for second.
CONDEMNATION never far back, offered a mild bid three wide into the stretch and was outfinished. JEBIP raced widest and closed some ground late in the
middle of the racetrack. GIV'EM THE BIZ away alertly, set the pace until mid stretch then weakened. KEEPING SCORE trailed into the stretch, swung wide
and passed tiring rivals. WILLIE JONES with the second flight two wide, lacked the needed response. MUCHO PRIMO pressed the pace two wide then
along the inside into the turn and was through after a half. SCORZA was no factor. WILDCAT BILL was through early. COUNTRY RUCKUS had brief
speed.

GLIMMERGLASS broke in full stride to set all the pace and widened through the stretch to win as much the best while being ridden out. KERRI'S MIRACLE
chased the winner and was no match while well clear for second. I'M JAC'D passed tiring rivals. NICKATYE chased the winner three wide and weakened in
the stretch. SHANGHAI ROYALTY had good early speed outside then faded. TITEBLUEJEANS had brief speed. BRICK OF HEARTS was outrun.
MOTOWN HARBOR was through early.
