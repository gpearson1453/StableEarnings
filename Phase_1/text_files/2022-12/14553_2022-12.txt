off the early pace, raced near the rail past the quarter pole and raced evenly late with no closing run. EXECUTIVE ACTION settled off the early going,
moved up three wide past the five sixteenths pole, was six to seven deep into the upper stretch and had no late rally. WIND RIVER chased the early pace
while racing three wide and gave way. POPS AWESOME dropped back early, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and had no late rally. TOOL
TIME raced mid pack early on, was near the inside around the far turn through the stretch and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
QUEEN OF LOVE showed good early foot to set the early pace from the inside and held gamely to be clear late under steady handling. LILA'S LUCKY
LADY stalked the pace while racing from the outside of foes, moved up through the far turn and finished second best while racing five deep. GOLD
INCLUDED was off a step slow, raced near the back of the pack early on, moved up five wide near the quarter pole and improved position in the drive. BIG
CYN settled off the early going, raced near the rail around the far turn into the upper stretch and had no late rally. Y NOT SIZZLE tracked the early leader
from the outside and tired readily.
