Footnotes
RANSOMS REWARD raced in the two path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far turn, dueled down the stretch while drifting out significantly and just got the bob for the win. REDZILLA raced in
the three path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, navigated the far turn from the four path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and dueled down the lane, drifting some and just missing. BLACK KARMA raced off the pace on the outside through the
opening half mile, saved ground at the back of the pack coming around the second bend and gained ground quickly through the final furlong. SHE IS
ROYALTY raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, saved ground around the final turn and gained
ground through the stretch, just missing third. BYZANTINE EMPIRE led the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled
from the rail around the second bend and weakened in the lane. WICKED SAUCY raced in the three path early, chased the leader up the backstretch,
challenged from the two path coming around the far turn and tired in the stretch. CASARENA HOTTIE trailed the field throughout and despite saving
ground, was never a factor.

PRETTY'N AWESOME pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, challenged from the two path coming around the turn and drew off in the lane.
STORMIN' AMANDA veered out leaving the gate, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the two and three path around the bend and gained
ground late. BEAST BUNNY led the way on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, gave way in upper stretch and
weakened late. UNCAPTURED DREAMS hopped up leaving the gate, settled well off the pace in the middle of the pack for the run up the backstretch,
saved ground around the turn and finished evenly. K D STRONG was pinched back at the break, raced at the back of the pack early, saved ground around
the turn and made no bid. DESTINY COCO trailed well behind the field throughout, saved ground and was never a factor.

Footnotes
GOLDEN TONE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the five path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and
gained ground to pull clear late. PARTNER'S HOPE led the way on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and was caught
late while drifting near the wire. I'LL FINISH pressed the pace on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, dueled from the three path around the
turn and was outkicked in the lane. THAT'S MY BOI TOY raced in the middle of the pack between horses in the opening stages, began to move up while
saving ground around the turn and continued to gain ground mildly from the rail late. THEJIGISUP raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch,
began a bid from the four path coming around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. TITHED trailed the field on the inside early, navigated the turn from
the two path and never threatened. ANY MINUTE chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and faded in the lane.

the outside up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path, dueled down the stretch and pulled clear late. WHISKEYMAC was bumped
soundly by the horse to his outside at the start, recovered to lead the field while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, continued to
show the way while racing in the two path around the bend, dueled in upper stretch, was caught and kept on to the wire. RED OCTOBER raced in the three
path early, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack on the outside, came around the far turn in the two path and gained ground while drifting
late. JAY BIRD raced in the four path around the first turn, chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the four
path and flattened out in the lane. THE SWAYZE EXPRESS saved ground around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the run up
the backstretch, came around the second bend in the two path and never threatened. BALLINDINE raced in the middle of the pack between horses through
the opening half mile, saved ground around the far turn and was empty in the stretch. MIRO trailed well behind the field the entire way around the oval,
