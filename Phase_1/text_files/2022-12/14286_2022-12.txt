Footnotes
STIMULUS MAKER , along the inner rail stalking the pace down the backstretch, eased out to the three path on the turn, gained a short lead outside foes in
upper stretch and drove clear. ARISTOCAT showed speed along the inner rail, battled with the winner in the stretch and faded late. BETTHEOVER raced in
the two path inside horses around the turn, found room along the inner rail in the stretch and passed tired foes. ITS OVER prompted the pace outside
ARISTOCAT around the turn and gave way in upper stretch. NOTION TO TAPIT offered a mild four deep move leaving the turn and failed to sustain the bid.
CAIRO BOOGIE , never a factor, saved ground around the turn and drifted out in mid stretch. ICHIGO was outrun. ORO GRIS , in the three path chasing
the pace on the turn, gave way in the stretch. GARITOFF raced in the three path on the turn and faltered.

JOHNNYFRENCHFRI sped clear early, dictated the pace off the inside, responded when set down in upper stretch and held firm while kept to task.
FREDDYNESS stalked the winner three wide, was under a hustling ride past the five sixteenths, kept on willingly through the final furlong and out finished
READ THE SPEC to his inside. READ THE SPEC , away alertly, raced three wide outside rivals early on, dropped in under pressure mid turn, edged up
entering the lane then flattened out late. GREAT DAYS AHEAD , in tight at the break, angled in early and settled, came out around the turn, circled four
wide making some headway into the lane, failed to kick on in mid stretch and faded. SMART AND FAST saved ground and inside a pair of foes early, was
shuffled back entering the turn and failed to recover. SMALL BUT FEISTY broke a bit slowly, moved up between runners nearing the five furlong marker,
failed to go on around the turn and faded.

Footnotes
OUR HOISTED MAST got into a battle to the inside of TOM TERRIFIC early on and alternated for command, wandered outward a bit when put to pressure
entering the lane, corrected and carried the duel to mid stretch, spurted clear soon after and widened while kept alert. TOM TERRIFIC , bumped at the
break and was off a step slow, recovered and accelerated between foes to join the winner from his outside, was floated out a bit while sparring into the lane,
remained in touch to mid stretch, gave way grudgingly and dug in for the place. BOONDOGGLE settled in a perfect spot just off the dueling leaders, tracked
from the outside mid turn, ranged up five wide into the stretch, briefly threatened past the three sixteenths then hung late. CONFUSION BABY BOY drafted
back towards the rail early on, remained inside into the lane and came back a bit late. SHOULDA HAD IT pulled her way along between rivals early,
dropped in and edged up mid turn, came back out to pursue in upper stretch then faded. JETTIN OUT , off the pace, raced four wide into the lane but
needed more between rivals in deep stretch. SMILE BRYAN came out at the break and bumped with a rival, raced well back early while under coaxing,
came five wide for the drive but lacked a solid finish. EXCALIBUR , four wide outside foes heading to the half mile marker, remained three to four wide and
failed to make and impact.

Footnotes
BLAZE ON prompted the pace outside LIL SPINNER, secured command in upper stretch, went clear, drifted in despite left hand urging near the sixteenth
pole and prevailed under pressure. ELLIE VICTORINA , inside horses around the turn, raced in the two path through the stretch and split rivals near the
sixteenth pole when rallying. LIL SPINNER , under urging soon after the break, set the pace along the inner rail, lost the advantage in upper stretch and
faded late. LOVE NOTION , bumped and caught in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, saved ground on the turn, eased out for the drive and finished
willingly. BOSSYNESS , four wide turn, gave way. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN , in tight quarters leaving the starting gate, raced near the inner rail on the turn
and failed to rally. BUTTERMILK GIRLZ bore out leaving the starting gate then was outrun. BREEZY LEIGH bore in leaving the starting gate, chased the
pace in the three path to the stretch and stopped.

GOLDEN EFFECT , off a step slow, regrouped and pulled her way forward between rivals, set up shop outside the leader while in hand, applied more
pressure mid turn, took over soon into the lane, kicked clear after being roused, remained on her left lead till deep stretch then was fully extended to hold
sway. RED QUEEN gained a forward spot early while saving ground, saw the leaders get away a bit leaving the far turn, came under a ride past the three
eighths, shifted out in upper stretch and closed steadily. SWEET TALIA , off the pace while saving ground, swung out four wide entering the stretch and
churned on. ESPERANNNA took over early and was nursed on the lead about two wide, dropped in leaving the far turn then was engaged past the three
eighths, dueled into the lane then weakened through the final furlong. IMAGINE VICTORY lagged back, saved ground into the stretch and failed to menace.
ABIDALE , urged along off the rail, failed to keep pace into the turn, raced outside a rival mid turn and faded. NOTION INTERRUPTUS , sluggish away, was
outrun. CHICA RABIOSA gave some early pursuit four wide and retreated.

Footnotes
LUNAR ICE bore out leaving the starting gate, stalked the pace in hand behind horses for five furlongs, swung to the four path when commencing his bid at
the head of the stretch, swept to command in upper stretch and pulled away under urging. ISABELLA'S GLORY lacked speed behind rivals, moved to the
five path turning for home and gained the place. VICTORIAN RIVIERA disputed the pace in the two path between horses and weakened late. LADY
MOSLER hugged the inner rail, disputed the pace to upper stretch then gradually weakened. COFFEE BEAN , four deep chasing the pace for five furlongs,
was fanned seven deep turning for home and gave way. TOUSSAUD'S RANSOM , bumped leaving the starting gate, hugged the inner rail on the turn and
dropped back through the stretch. KERFORD'S COMMISH , in the three path prompting the pace for a half mile, faltered in the stretch run.

Footnotes
ITALIAN DRESSING edged up in hand past the five eighths and tracked the leader, moved to challenge after a half, dueled under confident handling past
the five sixteenths, secured command entering the lane, responded when set down soon after and powered away under a drive as much the best.
CANADIAN GINGER stalked towards the rail, shifted out three wide entering the lane, straightened and gave willing pursuit while just saving the place.
BREVIARY lagged well back through the opening half mile, came under pressure and circled five wide into the lane, closed belatedly and just missed
second. MY BOSS LADY settled in the clear, moved up a bit leaving the far turn, was put to a strong ride soon after, came four wide for the drive but was
out kicked between foes. UNREQUITED LOVE cleared early and set the early pace about two wide, was joined by the winner with three furlongs remaining,
sparred to the head of the lane then gave way through the final turlong. TOWERING GAZE , towards the inside, was outrun.

BLAMEITONTHEFUN saved ground on the turn stalking the pace, eased out to the two path turning for home, closed between horses and led late. SAINT
MARCO prompted the pace outside ONLY CHILD, drifted out entering the stretch and gave way grudgingly. ON THE ENGINE chased the pace three wide
around the turn, was floated out turning for home and weakened the final furlong. ONLY CHILD set the pace along the inner rail and weakened. CASH KID
hugged the inner rail on the turn, swung to the six path in upper stretch and was not a factor. NEVERFOLD , three deep on the turn, was not a factor.
MANKLIN CREEK , outrun, raced along the inner rail in the stretch.
