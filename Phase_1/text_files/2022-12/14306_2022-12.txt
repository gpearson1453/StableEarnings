Footnotes
BIG FRANK never far back, rallied four then three wide through the stretch to make the lead inside the furlong marker and edged clear late under mild
urging. STOP MAKING SENSE chased the pace for six furlongs, drew on even terms for the lead, battled until deep stretch and finished gamely for second.
VALHALLA AIR BASE vied for the lead along the inside into the stretch, angled out four wide past the furlong marker and finished determinedly. SOUPER
PRONTO set the pace along the inside until mid stretch then was outfinished. MINE NOT MINE failed to menace. EASTON ROCKS was no factor. STAYIN
OR STRAYIN was a forward factor into the far turn then stopped. LEND AMERICA was outrun and also stopped.

RAISON KARTER close up from the start, advanced steadily four then three wide to make the lead on the far turn then widened the balance of the trip
under right handed urging to win as much the best. JUSTIN'S QUEST had speed from the start, loomed boldly three wide nearing the quarter pole and
finished second best. UNCAPTURED PULSE made the lead soon after the start, set the pace into the far turn, kept on but was outfinished. BOURBON
WISDOM failed to menace. PATIO PARTY pressed the pace along the inside into the far turn then faded in the stretch. CANDY KINGDOM saved ground
early, and passed tiring rivals two wide through the stretch. NOT YET CHARLIE close up, dropped back on the second turn then came on again late inside.
HIATUS stalked the pace two wide into the stretch then gave way. MONEY FOR MISCHIEF was outrun. OWN THE TOWN was through after a half.

urging. FIRSTHAND JUSTICE never far back, rallied determinedly along the rail into the stretch and finished second best. ROMANTIC COWBOY away
alertly, set the pace until deep stretch then was outfinished two wide. MOBIL SOLUTION never far back, swung wide and finished evenly in the seven path.
AUTHENTIC COWTOWN vied for the lead along the inside, moved closer on the far turn then failed to sustain that bid. MANGA MAN was squeezed at the
start, swung wide and passed tiring rivals. RELISH THE RIDE chased the pace for six furlongs then faded. SHANGHAI PRINCE checked along the inside
into the clubhouse turn then was no threat. HITE had brief speed. SPEEDY MOBILE was through after a half. PAT'S KARMA pressed the pace into the far
turn then gave way. POWERFUL PHIL had speed from the start along the rail, checker entering the second turn then lost momentum.

RUNLIKEJACKIEO allowed to settle, closed willingly along the inside through the stretch and finished second best. SOMUCHSUGAR stalked the pace from
the inside early, shifted out to the four path then went evenly. MOBIL CHIC wide early, failed to menace. CROSSED UP trailed into the stretch then passed
tiring rivals. THE LAST APPLE had good early speed then faded. CONSECUTIVE RUN was no threat. HOSANNA was no factor. CLIFTONS BALLERINA
was hustled along the pressure the winner two wide early then stopped in the stretch.
