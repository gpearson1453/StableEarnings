Footnotes
COMET CAUSEY raced in the two path around the first turn, dueled on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and battled the length
of the stretch to just hold the victory. ONE MARK dueled on the outside through the opening half mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn
and dug in gamely in the lane but just missed. STORM BAYOU saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the backstretch,
continued around the far turn in the two path and improved position mildly in the stretch. EFFORT N RESULTS raced in the two path early, settled in the
middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, navigated the far turn from the three path and finished evenly. MASTERCLASS saved
ground through the opening quarter of a mile, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, came around the second bend in the three path,
swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there. ELLIOT raced in the three path at the back of the pack around the first turn and up the
backstretch, dropped back to trail the field coming around the far turn and was not a factor. DUE TO A TIMING MALFUNCTION, THE MILE SPLIT IS
UNAVAILABLE. THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

RIO HATO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter
pole and kicked clear in the lane. CLOWN OIL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, came around the turn in the two path and gained ground
late. LEA COSTA ME chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the four path around the turn and kept on to the wire.
CHA CHING CHARLIE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn and was outfinished in late stretch.
WHO'S ON THE RUN raced off the pace between horses early, saved ground around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane while never
threatening. HOLLYWOOD PRINCE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled while saving ground around the turn and faded in the stretch.
FEISTY TOWN raced at the back of the pack early, came around the turn in the two path, swung wide entering the stretch and was empty from there.
EIGHT MAKAR dwelt leaving the gate, trailed far behind the field and was never a factor. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON
REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE EIGHT, EIGHT MAKER, HAD A FAIR START AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

Footnotes
ANTONIOS MARK raced in the three path around the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid
from the three path coming around the far turn and pulled clear in the final furlong. OL' MCCLINTOCK raced in the four path around the first turn, stalked the
leaders on the outside up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the two path coming around the second bend and kept on to the wire. SWEET
MONEY led the field on the inside around the first turn and up the backstretch, gave way while racing in the three path around the far turn and came on
again in the stretch to finish evenly. GEORGE WHO pressed the pace from the three path through the opening half mile, dueled from the two path around
the second bend and weakened in late stretch. SEVENTH ST DIAMOND saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of
the pack between horses, came around the far turn in the two path and offered no bid. SMARTSREALGOOD raced in the two path early, settled off the
pace for the run up the backstretch, continued around the far turn in the three path and was empty in the stretch. SENSE OF URGENCY tracked the field
while saving ground around the first turn and up the backstretch, began to lose ground while racing on the rail around the far turn and tired further in the
lane. SHAME ON SAM hopped up leaving the gate, trailed the field the entire way around the oval, raced in the two path and was not a factor.

on the rail up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch and was caught late. SAMBAS MARK
settled in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, blew the turn, drifting out to the eight path entering the stretch and
gained ground from there. TATAS JOE MARK raced in the middle of the pack on the inside up the backstretch, began to improve position while racing in the
four path around the turn and continued to improve position to the wire. FLAGS FINALE dueled up the backstretch, continued to battle while saving ground
around the turn and weakened in the stretch. ARTFUL CRITIC was bumped by the horses to his inside leaving the gate, raced off the pace up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and passed tiring horses in the lane. LAUGHTEN raced in the middle of the pack through the opening
quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the two path and finished evenly. SHAME ON ZCUINTLE raced off the pace up the backstretch, swung out to the
five path for the run around the turn and improved position mildly in the lane while never threatening. KING BRYCE bumped with the horses to both sides
leaving the gate, was shuffled to the pack of the pack in the opening stages, made up some ground while racing on the rail around the turn and flattened out
in the final furlong. ROMP N ROLL veered in and bumped with the horses to both sides at the start, settled in the middle of the pack between horses for the
run up the backstretch and faded in the stretch. F J COLIMA raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the four path
and was empty in the lane. BABY GABE dropped back to trail well behind the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was simply outrun.
