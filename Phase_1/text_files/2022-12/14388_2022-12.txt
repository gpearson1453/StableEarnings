CRUZ IN THE CASTLE took over and tapered to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the
far turn and held on under steady stretch handling. MIZZEN stalked two deep, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole and contested at a close
disadvantage off the rail on the far turn, dug in to clear second late strides and was gaining on the winner. IMAGINE VICTORY settled inside, bid leaving the
three eighths pole and raced near the rail on the far turn, then flattened late yards. SKYFLY raced off the pace in the three path, gave chase from the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and showed little in the lane. UNEXPECTEDLY raced well off the early pace inside then eased out into the
backstretch, bid toward the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path and showed little more. GOLDEN ACCOUNT rounded the opening
turn in the three path, left the turn outside and picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, but faded past the five sixteenths. WATERLOO ROSE

pole, rounded the far turn near the rail, eased out into the lane and finished well. CEDARS BULLS EYE settled off the pace in the four path the opening turn,
