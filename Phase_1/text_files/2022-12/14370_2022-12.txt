Footnotes
MIRACLE SILVER rated close off the rail, challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole and dueled at even terms two deep on the far turn, took the nod
leaving the eighth pole and dug in determinedly to hold off JAMMIN JIMTOWN, who raced off the pace in the four path the first turn, rounded the second
turn in the five path, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole, raced close four wide on the far turn and was outfinished in the duel through the stretch. ONE
TWO KID rated close inside, gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn off the rail and came along for third inside the sixteenth pole.
MASAI MAN rated a short lead inside, came under pressure leaving the seven sixteenths pole, contested even terms at the rail through the far turn but
weakened toward mid-stretch. POSITIVE PHIL came away a bit rank and rounded the first turn about the three path, raced in the six path the second turn,
challenged from the seven sixteenths pole, raced close three wide on the far turn but showed little in the lane. RIGHTEOUS MAN settled off the pace about
the three path, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but showed little response. OFFICER APPEAL stalked the early pace then faded through the
second turn.

SUE LOVES BARBADOS rated close then challenged toward the seven sixteenths pole, contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the far turn but dug
in under determined handling to take the nod in the final yards. DEBIT CARD rated a slim lead inside, came under pressure toward the seven sixteenths
pole, contested the edge nearest the rail on the far turn, was steadily handled leaving the turn but grudgingly ceded the final yards. HAPPY CHARLIE
rounded the first turn about the four path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then dueled through the stretch for
third. VIOLENT ROCK stalked the earlier pace about the three path, gave chase from the seven sixteenths pole, raced near the rail on the far turn then
outfinished in the stretch duel for third. STEAL THE CASH raced off the rail on the first turn, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the
far turn about the three path and showed little in the lane. BENNY THE BOOK stalked inside, gave chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn at
the rail and showed little more. NORDIC RHYTHM raced well back.
