Footnotes
DIVINE CROSS stalked the pace on the outside, bumped twice with ALLAMERICANBEAUTY near the half-mile pole, chased three then four wide around
the turn, gained to take a narrow advantage in upper stretch, drifted in outside the eighth-pole, responded well outside the next two in the final furlong and
narrowly prevailed under strong urging. LA GROTTE was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked in the two then three path
on the turn, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch, drifted in some outside the eighth-pole, fought on well inside that foe in the final furlong and
just missed while able to get the place. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT was taken in hand early then rated on the inside, lost position while crowded along the rail
from the seven-sixteenths to the three-eighths, saved ground into the stretch, chased the top two under a drive to the wire and lacked the needed kick while
far clear for the show. ALLAMERICANBEAUTY broke in and bumped hard with a foe then was bumped hard from the outside, moved to the outside then
advanced, bumped twice with DIVINE CROSS near the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn, was taken up off heels while lugging in at the
three-eighths, continued to lug in under extra right-rein pressure, dropped to the two path approaching the quarter-pole and came up empty. HERECOMES
SCARLETT veered in at the start then bumped hard with a foe, chased the pace down the backstretch, went around most of the turn in the two path, shifted
three wide late on that bend, floated five wide into the stretch and tired. GERMANY JAYVO was bumped hard on both sides and bounced around at the
start, dropped well behind while racing greenly early, saved ground on the turn and trailed.

Footnotes
VALENZAN DAY was hustled from the start, pressed the pace on the outside, took the lead in the three then four path around the turn, shook clear outside
the quarter-pole and drew away under steady urging. BOBBY THE TANK was coaxed along just off the pace, went two to three wide on the turn, was asked
at the five-sixteenths, chased the winner into upper stretch and proved no match while able to get the place. VICTIM OF THE NITE broke a step slow then
was hustled, raced outside under coaxing, was urged four then five wide on the turn and came up empty while best of the rest. GOING IN STYLE broke out
a bit but was quickly corrected, moved up with five furlongs to run, drafted inside on the turn, dropped back behind a tiring foe late on that bend, shifted
three wide outside the quarter-pole and had nothing left. ROL AGAIN DANCER lost his footing some at the start, was hustled to the front, showed the way
under some pressure, lost the lead in the two path before the three-eighths and faded. FLASHY ALEX ducked in at the start, dropped well behind the rest of
the field, went three then four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, drifted in nearing the furlong marker and was no factor while not persevered
late for fifth place owner purse money.

BANTERRA four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, advanced to take command swinging five to six wide into upper stretch, drew
clear under a drive kept to task. PEBBLE LANE chased five wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, improved
position to secure the place honors while never threatening the top one. LOCKBOX broke in at the start trading a bump with DISRUPTION, who broke
outwards, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and kept on to preserve the show
honors. SECURITY CODE lunged at the start getting away last, raced six paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through
the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and passed tired rivals in the stretch. DISRUPTION broke out at the start
bumping with LOCKBOX, who broke inwards, chased two to three wide under coaxing from midway on the turn, went five wide into upper stretch and
weakened. HIGHWAY HARMONY three wide in pursuit, got ridden along three furlongs from home, continued three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
SINFUL DANCER was well placed just off the pace on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, squeezed through inside of a foe
while crowded against the rail in upper stretch, gained to make a bid coming to the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling. ONE WHIRLWIND RIDE
pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path around the turn, took the lead into upper stretch, led under a drive to the sixteenth-pole but was
caught while just able to hold the place. EMINENCY was urged along off the pace, went to three wide on the turn, had the rider lose his crop while angling
out in upper stretch, gained under a vigorous hand-ride to make a bid into the final furlong, fought on even terms into the final sixteenth but just missed while
narrowly able to get the show. AMEDEUS MUSIC broke a step slow, was urged along on the outside, went six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the
stretch, rallied outside into the final furlong and closed well to just miss the trifecta. CAN'T BEAT ME bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along off the
pace, went three to four wide on the turn, rallied in upper stretch, closed well into the final sixteenth, steadied behind the leaders while posing a major threat
into the final sixteenth, altered closer to the inside shortly thereafter and finished with good energy but missed the superfecta. GINNSU WARRIOR settled
on the outside, was urged five wide on the turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed kick. GOLQUIST bumped with a foe at the
start, showed the way down the backstretch while under pressure to his outside, vied inside to the two path on the turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch
and gave way. KINGSTOWN chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and tired. HE'SGOTTASHORTFUSE
established position just off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and came up empty.
