Footnotes
BIG GIFT was crowded leaving the break and away a step slowly, was unhurried through the first half-mile, roused four wide nearing the quarter marker,
drifted in a bit and brushed with PRANCIN N THE PARK in upper stretch, straightened for the drive and drew away in the late stages to be much the best.
PRANCIN N THE PARK crowded BIG GIFT at the start, raced three wide into the first turn, rated off of the moderate pace through the backstretch run,
advanced three wide on the second turn, brushed with BIG GIFT in upper stretch, was no match for the winner in the final furlong and was best of the rest.
SPORTS FOR WOMEN was allowed to settle, saved ground into the second turn, was not able to impact the top pair in the drive, passed tiring rivals in the
final sixteenth and was up for show in the final strides. IRISH SONG LEADER rated off of the early pace, mounted a two wide bid nearing the quarter
marker, steadied in upper stretch when BIG GIFT drifted in, could not keep pace in the drive and was just edged for show in the final strides. PRAY FOR
SNOW contested the moderate early pace with TIZ SO SPECIAL, tracked that rival to the half-mile marker, assumed command along the second turn and
vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, steadied in tight quarters at the top of the lane and tired in the final stages. TIZ SO SPECIAL showed early
speed, contested the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost position nearing the second turn and lost contact nearing the top of the lane.

Footnotes
ROISTER broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, was well handled while dictating terms through the backstretch run, extended the lead nearing the
quarter marker, drew clear approaching mid-stretch and kept to task in the late stages. HULA KING was crowded by OBVIOUS at the start and was off a
step slowly, tracked the early pace three wide into the first turn, ran in pursuit of ROISTER along the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the second
turn, came six wide into upper stretch, could not make headway on the winner in the drive and was best of the rest. MR BOTANICALS was allowed to settle,
advanced two wide on the second turn, mounted a three wide bid into upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and held well for show. FLY BUDDY FLY
tracked the early pace from the second flight, saved ground to the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. OBVIOUS
crowded HULA KING at the start, was a bit keen in the early stages, attended to the decent fractions to the half-mile marker, lost position on the second turn
and gave way. TAM'S TIME was unhurried, lost contact nearing the quarter marker and was not a factor.

ZHIVAGO was sent to dispute the early pace, set decent fractions while pressed to the quarter marker, shook clear in upper stretch and held safely in the
late stages over the oncoming runner-up. PERFORMATIVE broke in at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the decent early pace, advanced three
wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in deep stretch while green and on the left lead and was gaining on ZHIVAGO late to be second
best. HOT ROD JIMMY stalked the decent early fractions from the second flight, advanced four wide on the turn, was outkicked in the drive and stayed on in
the final stages to secure third. STORMY JOE showed early speed, pressed the decent early pace to the quarter marker, chased ZHIVAGO to mid-stretch,
weakened in the late stages and was just edged for show in the final strides. MIQUEAS lacked early speed, raced two wide on the turn and finished evenly
in the drive. SUN AND SURF was away a step slowly, was outrun in the early stages, was pulled up midway through the turn and was vanned off.

LOUIE showed early speed, pressed the solid pace outside of MISTER MIDAS along the turn, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, could not match strides
with IN HONOR OF AUTISM in the final sixteenth and was second best in the end. MISTER MIDAS was asked to show early speed, set decent early
fractions while pressed through the turn, held STRUT ON LOUIE at bay to mid-stretch, weakened in the final furlong and was clear for third in the late
stages. TALK ABOUT AUTISM stalked the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not sustain that bid in the drive and flattened. JERRY JEFF
WALKER chased the solid early pace, advanced four wide on the turn, drifted in upper stretch and tired in the drive. DOGE OF VENICE chased from the
rear, raced two wide to the quarter marker and did not produce a late rally.

Footnotes
SNOW HILL rated off of the decent early pace, was well positioned through the backstretch run, slipped to the inside along the far turn, advanced in upper
stretch, was full of run nearing mid-stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong pole and drew clear in the final stages. RELUCTANT settled in the
second flight in the early stages, was well placed while two wide into the second turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well in the final furlong, was no
match for the winner in the late stages and was up for place in the final strides. AIRKITA saved ground into the first turn while tracking the early pace, ran in
pursuit of FLAPS UP to the second turn, rallied three wide nearing the top of the lane, vied for the lead in mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final furlong and
was just edged for second in the final strides. FUNKY GREY was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the loose pacesetter through moderate fractions
to the second turn, vied for the lead in upper stretch, took a narrow lead to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the late stages and weakened. CHELINA
broke out at the start and crowded NAUGHTY FLIRT at the break, settled off of the pace while in the second flight, was steered three wide on the second
turn, came four wide for the drive and finished evenly in the final furlong. VALDINI broke a step slowly and was allowed to settle, saved ground into the first
turn, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch and lacked a late kick in the drive. DARK INTENT broke out at the start
and was away slowly, was unhurried, improved position along the backstretch run, raced two wide to the quarter marker and lacked a late response. RIVER
AVENUE was hard to load, lost the rider before loading and ran off, was crowded at the start and away slowly, lacked early speed, saved ground to the
quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive and did not threaten. NAUGHTY FLIRT was shuffled at the start and away slowly, settled three wide along the
first turn, lost position along the backstretch run and was not a late factor. FLAPS UP broke alertly, showed early speed and established the pace into the
first turn, opened to a long lead along the backstretch run, came back to the field nearing the quarter marker, was collared in upper stretch and faded in the
late stages.

CHASE THE CHAOS rated off of the solid early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run while tracking the pacesetter, loomed nearing the quarter
marker, made a quick move to assume command in upper stretch, drew clear approaching the furlong pole and drew off under hand urging in the final
sixteenth. HAPPY DOES hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, was unhurried in the early going, raced three wide into the backstretch run,
improved position nearing the half-mile marker, mounted a four wide bid on the far turn, was no match for the winner in the drive and ran on to be second
best. TRAVEL THE MAP was away slowly and spotted the field in the early stages, was allowed to settle while saving ground along the first turn, improved
position nearing the half-mile marker, raced two wide to the quarter pole, swung three wide for the drive, could not impact the top two late and stayed on to
secure third. SMOKIN' HOT was sent in the early stages, kept close attendance to the solid pace through the backstretch run, advance to duel with
ABINADI to the quarter marker, could not keep pace with CHASE THE CHAOS leaving the second turn and weakened in the final furlong. SUBURBAN
PRINCE was forwardly placed into the first turn, stalked the solid early fractions to the half-mile marker, lost ground three wide on the far turn and gave way.
STRENGTH OF AUTISM settled off of the solid early pace, lost position on the second turn and did not threaten. ITS THIEVERY was allowed to settle,
saved all of the ground, dropped back leaving the three-furlong marker and was not a factor. ABINADI broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set solid
fractions through the backstretch run, dueled with SMOKIN' HOT to the quarter marker, was overtaken leaving the second turn and tired in the drive.

Footnotes
ALWAYS SEEKING tracked the quick early pace, improved position while saving ground on the turn, mounted an inside rally in upper stretch, took a narrow
lead nearing the furlong pole, determinedly kept to task in the final furlong and held sway in the late stages over the oncoming runner-up. LADY'S SERMON
rated off of the quick early pace, raced three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive, advanced nearing mid-stretch, closed well in the final
sixteenth, could not get by the determined winner in the final strides and was second best. ZAZEN was shuffled at the start and was away slowly, pulled on
the rider to be forwardly placed into the turn, pressed the quick fractions while three deep nearing the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch, was
outkicked in the late stages and stayed on to secure the show. BLUE WILDCAT showed early speed, disputed the quick pace with CALLMEMARTHAJANE
through the turn, drifted out leaving the quarter marker to leave the rail open in upper stretch, battled for the lead to the furlong pole, weakened in the late
stages and was edged for third in the final strides. GRAZEN IN THE SUN bobbled at the start, hit the gate and was away slowly, lacked speed while saving
ground on the turn and offered a mild late rally. CODE RIBBON was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide while trailing along the turn, swung widest
for the drive and finished evenly. CALLMEMARTHAJANE was sent in the early stages, engaged with BLUE WILDCAT and dueled with that foe through
quick fractions to the quarter marker, lost position nearing the furlong pole and faded late. CAUSE SHE'S A LADY chased the quick early pace, lost position
two wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
O'NEILL'S LEGACY broke sharply then was hustled to gain a clear early lead while setting comfortable fractions, was challenged by CRYSTAL PROOF
nearing the quarter pole, engaged that rival to deep stretch then gained the upper hand late and prevailed. STOIC LUNA was bumped by CRYSTAL
PROOF at the start and spotted the field a few lengths, recovered quickly and made slow but steady forward progress through the turn, was set down with a
quarter mile to go and finished resolutely to gain second in the final strides. CRYSTAL PROOF broke out and bumped hard with STOIC LUNA after the
break but was quick into stride and took up a tracking position behind the pacesetter down the backstretch and into the turn, moved up to challenge
O'NEILL'S LEGACY for the lead near the quarter pole, dueled for a little over a furlong and weakened in the late stages. ASHLEY'S RAINBOW off a step
slow, raced near the rear of the pack early, steadied slightly entering the turn, launched a bid from the three furlong marker and finished with some interest
but had too much ground to make up. GET'EM TIGER broke well and was in good position early, saving ground through the turn, had a mild response when
asked but was unable to quicken enough to pose a threat in the stretch. LADY IN A HURRY last away from the gate, chased the field to the turn, came
under heavy pressure with three eights of a mile to go but could not muster the needed response. PHANTOM INDIAN raced near the back of the pack in the
early going while racing wide, lugged in heading into the turn, bothering ASHLEY'S RAINBOW, attempted a bid from the seven sixteenths but quickly
flattened out. MARY MARGARET outrun throughout, kept to task and managed out beat one at the wire. DRESS REHEARSAL came away well at the start,
was in good position for a quarter mile but began to lose ground on the turn and never mustered a rally.
