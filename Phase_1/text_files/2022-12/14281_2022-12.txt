Footnotes
PINCH ME A PENNY tracked the top pair from the four path, bid at the five sixteenths pole, tucked down to the three path entering the lane while sparring
with an inner DORGENOIS, wrestled an advantage in the skirmish in upper stretch, and drove clear after flopping back to his left lead entering the final
sixteenth. DORGENOIS set the pace inside of a pressing rival while remaining a path off of the rail, met a challenge from PINCH ME A PENNY at the five
sixteenths pole, dug in to resist that foe's bid entering the lane, dueled gamely while hanging on his left lead thereafter, but yielded a sixteenth from home.
BLINDEDBYTHEGEES stalked along the inside, then chased evenly while hanging on his left lead. REALITOS pressed the leader from the three path, but
was outmoved by an outer bidding foe at the five sixteenths pole, slightly took back entering the lane when that rival shifted down across his path, and
yielded. MOKINGS lacked speed in the four to five paths, and failed to factor. SWIFT N TRAFFIC laid off of the pace in the two path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
JAZLA sped clear, showed the way in the two path, inched a wider margin in upper stretch, then held sway from a chasing rival after flopping back to her left
lead entering the final sixteenth. LEXINGTON DIVA stalked along the inside, took aim outside of the clear leader in upper stretch, but only managed to grind
into her advantage through the final furlong. HIGHER NOTE pursued the clear leader two wide, but yielded place to her inner chasing counterpart entering
the lane, gave way while hanging on her left lead, yet managed show. LENNI BE LUCKY broke outwardly causing her to bump and push out an outer rival
at the start, laid off of the pace two wide, emerged from between horses entering the turn to track from the three path, shifted to the four path entering the
lane, and chased the leaders home while not threatening. MISS TONALIST broke a step slowly at the start, lagged behind the field in the four path, then
stayed on in the six path through the lane. THIRSTY SISTER lacked speed in the three path, and made little impact. GIGLIO was bumped and pushed
outwardly by an inner foe at the start, took the turn in the four path while off of the pace, and faded. MUCHO MACHO BABY began to shuffle about right
before the gates sprung causing her to hop into the outer part of the stall and come out multiple lengths slow, then laid off of the pace along the inside, and
tired.

Footnotes
GLENN'S JUMPER quickly sped clear after breaking a tad inwardly, showed the way unencumbered in the two to three paths around the turn, and ran on
under driving pressure while drifting out through the late stages. TWO DOT laid off of the pace three wide, smartly tucked from the four path to the two path
at the five sixteenths pole rather than remaining outside of rivals, claimed place from an outer tiring foe at the three sixteenths pole, and held that position
late. FIFTEEN LOVE BACK lacked speed two wide, came into the lane in the four path, drifted outwardly in upper stretch, and stayed on in the eight path
through the final furlong to miss reaching place. THE GRAY BLUR saved ground far back, and chased along the rail. I'LL RAISE YOU chased the clear
leader from along the inside, tipped to the three path to be outside of that foe turning for home, but came into the lane in the four path, failed to change
leads in upper stretch, lost place to an inner rival at the three sixteenths pole, and weakened. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU stalked two wide, but was floated
to the four path by her inner chasing counterpart at the five sixteenths pole, and faded.

GUITAR WOMAN stalked two wide around the first turn, bid inside of the kept-wide leader at the five furlong pole, showed the way while tucking to the rail
entering the far turn, drew clear with five sixteenths to go, and inched away from a chasing rival through the final furlong. MO SMOKING tracked along the
inside, tugged to a stalking position entering the backstretch, claimed place while taking aim on the clear leader leaving the five sixteenths pole, but failed to
keep pace through the lane while drawing well clear of show. TAP IRON FIST trailed in the two path, gained inside of rivals turning for home, claimed show
from outer foes entering the lane, but drifted out in upper stretch, and failed to threaten the top pair. AGAMI tracked in the five path, but tired. HIGHLY
WICKED pressed the leader from the four path around the first turn, backed off to stalk entering the backstretch, but weakened in the three path around the
far turn. NICELY UNIFIED broke in, moved forward to set the pace while shifting out to the three path around the first turn, got headed by an inner foe with
five furlongs remaining, sustained pressure entering the far turn, but weakened turning for home. SIKARA SIKARA brushed the gate at the start, laid off of
the pace in the four path, and never got involved.

Footnotes
BATUCADA bobbled slightly while floated a bit out and off a beat slow at the start, settled off of the pace three wide, ranged up to around the far turn to take
aim on the clear leader turning for home, bid leaving the quarter pole, sparred through upper stretch, drove clear leaving the furlong grounds, and edged
away. ALL ABOUT ME set the pace while a bit off of the rail, enjoyed a clear margin around the far turn, dug in to resist BATACUDA's bid entering the lane,
dueled before getting headed nearing the furlong grounds, failed to keep pace leaving that juncture, and held place. TWO MINUTE DRILL stalked two wide,
chased the clear leader around the far turn, got outmoved by an outer foe entering the lane, yet kept on to sustain a chase thereafter, attempted a re-bid for
place in the closing stages, but did not have enough. BEYOND DOUBT laid in midpack along the inside early on, but failed to sustain that position down the
backstretch, raced off of the pace in the two path around the far turn, shifted out to the four, then five, path in upper stretch, and chased evenly. TAYLORS
TAP tracked two wide, moved forward while tucking to an inside stalking position down the backstretch, but only managed to chase the clear leader around
the far turn before fading through the lane. TATTERED HEART bobbled out while off a step slow at the start, laid off of the pace in the two path, tugged in
the bit while under a snug hold nearing the backstretch, and failed to get involved.

Footnotes
STAR MOMENT bobbled a bit and leaned out multiple paths while regaining balance, tracked four wide, loomed a danger while producing a bold bid outside
of the top pair leaving the three furlong pole, assumed command with five sixteenths to go, drew clear under no urging in upper stretch, but tired in the final
furlong, was roused to stay on task as an outer foe closed in inside the final sixteenth, and lasted to the wire. OLIVIA G laid off of the pace in the two to
three paths around the turn, shifted out to the five path in midstretch, rallied while cutting the clear leader's margin in the final sixteenth, but ran out of
ground late. PURSUIT L'HARMONIE broke sharp, vied for the lead two wide, but was outkicked and swiftly proved no match for an bidder approaching the
five sixteenths pole, chased that foe through midstretch, but lost place to an outer rival in the late stages. MIA ANTONIA hopped while breaking a step slow
at the start, trailed in the two path, swung out to the six path in upper stretch, and moved up. BITSY PERFECTMATCH broke a beat slow, chased from
midpack along the inside, took the turn in the two path, came into the lane in the three path, and lacked a bid. R T'S GEM stalked the top pair approaching
the turn, but faded turning for home. MADISON'S SCREEN rushed to vie for the lead along the inside, but offered little resistance to the eventual winner's
bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, gave way entering the lane, brushed the inner railing inside the quarter pole, and weakened.

Footnotes
NO PEDIGREE vied two wide and between horses in the scramble for the early lead, battled inside of a trio of foes around the turn after an inner rival
faltered, shook clear of those foes in upper stretch, and held sway under driving pressure. FORESTDUNGONE pressed five wide early on, vied four wide
while still in the five path around the turn, but briefly failed to keep pace with inner rivals entering the lane, kept on to duel for place through midstretch, and
edged that position late. BIG BELLA BROWN vied for the lead three to two wide and between horses, but failed to keep pace with her inner counterpart in
upper stretch, sparred for place with an outer rival and an inner bidder entering the final furlong, but was bested by the prior in the late stages. AFLEET
ASCENT hopped slightly at the start, laid off of the pace three wide, swung six wide entering the lane, and moved up while hanging on her left lead. SABER
RUN tracked along the inside, then two wide into the turn, tipped three wide entering the lane, chased while attempting a bid for place inside of a pair of foes
entering the final furlong, but flattened out late. ADIEU LE CHAT rated at the rear along the inside, then improved in upper stretch two wide while hanging
on her left lead. C'MON VE took a bump from an inner rival soon after the start, raced at the rear two wide, shifted six wide in midstretch, and failed to
factor. NOSY BANKER bumped an outer rival soon after the start, vied along the inside of a quartet of hounding rivals, but faltered entering the turn, and
faded through thelane. PEPPER JACK prompted the pace four wide and between horses, vied three wide around the turn, but faded turning for home.
