Footnotes
LIONISTIC dueled on the lead throughout and prevailed under firm handling. PACIFIC COAST dueled with the winner throughout and held grudgingly to just
miss. INDY PRINCESS KOKO allowed to settle early, had a mild bid four wide while no threat. GOOD ALTERNATIVE raced mid pack and saved ground in
the stretch. BEAV'S BOO had good position early, lacked a late response and went evenly. CAUSE OF LOVE was no factor. SPEEDY FIRE had brief foot
and was through early.
