Footnotes
REY O REYES took the lead approaching the three quarter pole and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure nearing the quarter pole,
widened at the rail on the far turn, drifted into the stretch and was steadily handled to hold on well. EISELE saved ground on the first turn, picked up the
chase leaving the three eighths pole and raced in the three path of the far turn, angled to the seven path approaching the head of the lane and got up for
second mid-stretch. LIL TOUGHMAN raced well back inside on the opening turn, picked up the chase leaving the half mile pole and rounded the far turn
near the rail, eased out mid-stretch and came along for third late yards. JOHNNY SWISH stalked from the three path the first turn, gave chase leaving the
three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path then flattened stride. RAYO NEGRO rated just off the early pace inside, gave chase into the
backstretch, raced near the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. SALTY J J rounded the first turn in the three and four paths, showed little response
through the backstretch then faded on the far turn. SKIP THE BULL rounded the first turn in the five path, gave chase past the half mile pole but weakened
on the far turn. FIT BUT FAT drifted on the opening turn and was not a factor. HENRY STANDINGBEAR rounded the first turn about the six path and was
not a factor.
