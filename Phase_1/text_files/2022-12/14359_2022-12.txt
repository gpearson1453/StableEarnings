Footnotes
EXECUTIVE ACTION pressed the pace of CORN POP while racing four-wide, moved up to engage that rival with a quarter to run, vied and edged away
through the closing yards. WIND RIVER was reserved just off the leaders early, moved four-wide through the turn, angled out further into the stretch and
finished with a steady bid. CORN POP was away in good order to set a pressured pace, responded when challenged by the winner nearing the quarter, vied
and gave way late. SILVER KING BAIN pressed the pace of CORN POP from the inside and gave way through the final furlong. HANKY PRANKY showed
no early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and was not a factor. GUARDSMAN PASS dropped far back early and did not offer a bid.

Footnotes
HI YAH pressed the pace while racing five-wide, moved up to take command nearing the three-sixteenths pole and drew off as a handy winner. DEBS WILD
broke sharply to set a pressured pace while racing three-wide, was no match for the winner in the drive but held on well to save the pace. MISTER
MAFIOSO pressed the pace of DEBS WILD from the inside and gave way gradually. SMOKIN' GOOD TIME settled off the leaders early, moved four-wide
through the turn, angled in with a furlong to run and finished evenly. WESTERBERG steadied nearing the nine-sixteenths marker, moved four-wide through
the turn and failed to rally. BIG JACK was away in good order then settled off the leaders throughout and gradually weakened. HARBOR THUNDER was off
a step slow and lagged throughout. THE RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
MR. WHO sprinted clear at once, saved ground while setting the pace , responded when challenged by MORE OVER (GB) nearing the quarter, re-cleared
and held sway to the wire. RIVER ROSE was reserved just off the leaders early, angled out nearing the quarter and failed to gain on the winner late. MOVE
OVER (GB) chased the leaders while racing three-wide, moved up to offer a bid nearing the quarter and failed to sustain his rally. PALACE PRINCE settled
off the leader from the inside and finished evenly in the drive. BERNALINHO chased the leaders while racing four-wide and gave way after going five
furlongs. REALLY SLOW showed no early speed, raced three-wide through the second turn and was not a factor. HEY SEQUOIA lacked early foot, saved
ground through the second turn and did not reach contention. WEAR THE CROWN raced off the pacesetters early, moved three-wide through the second
turn and weakened. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

HE'S A CANDY MAN was away alertly to set a pressured pace, opened a clear margin nearing the seven-sixteenths marker and drew off as an easy
winner. BEAUTIFUL MESS lacked early foot, raced five-wide through the turn, was no match for the winner in the drive but clearly second best. ANGELA'S
ANGEL was void of early speed, raced four-wide through the turn and finished with some late run. SIX SHOTS OF T was forwardly placed early, moved
four-wide through the turn and gave way in the drive. CAANFOOLERY chased the leaders while racing three-wide and weakened after going a half.
RENEGADE WARRIOR was void of early foot, raced five-wide through the turn and did not threaten. GLORY CITIZEN showed no early speed, raced
six-wide through the turn and did not offer a bid. CONSUMING showed brief speed and weakened.

OUR EMPIRE sprinted clear at once, raced off the rail while setting the pace and held MISAWA safe in the drive. MISAWA chased the winner while racing
three-wide throughout, could not reach that rival in the drive but finished well to hold the place. MUSICAL GEM was reserved just off the leaders from the
inside and failed to gain in the drive. IMISSBAYMEADOWS was forwardly placed early, moved four-wide through the turn and finished evenly. SHORT RIB
settled off the leaders early, moved six-wide through the turn and raced evenly throughout. W. WHITEHOUSE was void of early speed, raced seven-wide
through the turn and was not a factor. MYBESTISYETTOCOME raced off the pacesetters early, moved six-wide through the turn and failed to rally. MORE
ACTION lacked early foot, raced three-wide through the turn and was not a factor. THIRSTY KISS was pinched back at the start and lagged throughout.
