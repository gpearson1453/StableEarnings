Footnotes
DON'T TELL GRANDMA drew clear and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, contested the edge
nearest the rail on the far turn and dug in determinedly to hold off the game stretch challenge of MISS COREY, who rated close inside on the first turn,
started a bid toward the three eighths pole and contested at a close disadvantage two deep on the turn and remained a game stretch factor. HEIDI T settled
off the rail the first turn then eased out into the backstretch, picked up the chase nearing the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the five path but
showed little in the lane. WATERLOO ROSE raced well back inside early and could only improve her position. LOOKIN BACK rounded the first turn in the
three path then faded through the backstretch. SELENA SING tapered in to stalk off the rail, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole but faded toward the
five sixteenths.

Footnotes
GATITA SUAVE took the lead two deep approaching the first turn and rated the pace, came under pressure toward the three eighths pole, raced at the rail
on the far turn and was all out to hold on. SWEET FACTOR was bumped at the break then stalked from the two and three paths, bid leaving the three
eighths pole, rounded the far turn near the rail and dug in gamely, though, missed the nod. COWGIRL SHINE stalked in the four path the first turn, gave
chase from the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn in the three path, relented second inside the eighth pole and flattened the final sixteenth. CONCERT
HALL settled back inside on the opening turn then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward the seven sixteenths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn
and showed little in the lane. GOLDEN SALLY ducked in and made contact with Sweet Factor leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the three path,
picked up the chase from the seven sixteenths pole then flattened off the rail on the far turn. BEETHOVEN FRIEZE showed little response through the
backstretch. BEAUTIFUL MICHELLE mostly saved ground. BLUE AGAVE rated close inside and raced at near even terms into the backstretch, but dropped
back at the three eighths pole and faded readily.

eighths pole and improved steadily in the four path of the far turn, dug in from the head of the lane and dueled for second later yards. MAKE THE WAY
CLEAR settled off the rail on the first turn, bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and rounded the far turn about the three path, then relented in the stretch

back toward the three eighths pole and weakened off the rail on the far turn. DIVINING DANCER exchanged contact with VALIANT GABE leaving the gate
and saved ground racing well back. The latter exchanged contact with Divining Dancer leaving the gate, rounded the first turn in the four path, gave chase

Footnotes
HONEYQUIST took a quick lead and moved to the inside to rate the pace, came under pressure leaving the three eighths pole, raced near the rail on the far
turn and held well under steady stretch handling. JUBA'S NOTION rated close inside, picked up the chase toward the three eighths pole and raced in range
at the rail on the far turn, but couldn't improve in the stretch. NO LOVE FOR JUBA settled back inside on the first turn, bid leaving the three eighths pole,
rounded the far turn near the rail and ran evenly in the lane. LORD OF CORK rounded the first turn about the four path, picked up the chase toward the
three eighths pole, raced off the rail on the far turn then flattened in the lane. NEVERPOPTHECORK was shuffled back at the start and rounded the first turn
about the three path, left the turn outside, picked up the chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole and raced in the four path of the far turn, then weakened.
BELLA MELA stalked the early pace two deep, gave chase leaving the first turn but faded through the backstretch. AREYOUGONNAKISSME rounded the
first turn in the three path, gave chase leaving the turn but faded through the backstretch. PINNACLE REEF rounded the opening turn about the five path,
left the turn outside and gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, but weakened approaching the far turn. STRONG WILLED was never a factor.
