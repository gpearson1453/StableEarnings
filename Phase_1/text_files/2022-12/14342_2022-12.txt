RED REVOLUTION settled close up outside, bid to the front at the top of the stretch and drew away under moderate urging. MEGA CHARLIE controlled the
pace, was challenged at the quarter pole, relinquished the lead but continued willingly. PREDOMINATE dropped back early, chased inside and closed well
while no threat. FIRE'S FINALE trailed briefly then rallied mildly inside rivals through the stretch. THRILLS AND CHILLS prompted the pace outside for five
furlongs and weakened. MARGIN OF AIR raced off the pace three wide and faded steadily. JONNY QUIST stopped after a quarter mile and lost contact
with his field.

half a mile and continued well for the place. SOVEREIGN CHANGE raced in closest pursuit of the winner, bid at the quarter pole then proved empty late.
HORSE BE WITH YOU lacked speed along the inside, swung extremely wide into the stretch with a mild bid. TEMPESTUOUS urged close up early then
weakened steadily. MUSK chased in the two path early and lacked a rally. JOHNNYPUMP lagged far behind then caught a stopping rival. SINGLINO raced
wide within striking range then stopped after the half.
