Footnotes
UNION LIGHTS settled off the pace, moved in outside the five-eighths, advanced closer late on the backstretch, drafted inside on the turn, was given his
cue inside the five-sixteenths, rallied three wide into upper stretch, gained the lead inside the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. LEFTY'S
WAR was slowest into stride, angled out at the rear then was hard ridden on the outside, moved in late on the backstretch, dropped from the three path to
the two path at the three-eighths, shifted four wide into the stretch then came out nearing the three-sixteenths, remained on his inside lead in the drive and
got up for the place. NORTH POLE bumped lightly with a foe at the start, disputed the pace on the inside of a foe, vied near the rail on the turn, was asked
late on that bend, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and weakened but was clear for the show. TIGER TOWN BOY bumped lightly with rivals
on both sides at the start, was urged along off the pace, moved out outside the five-eighths, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch,
bumped with a foe near the three-sixteenths, raced between horses into the final furlong and lacked the needed response. GROWTH MINDSET established
a forward position inside of a foe early, was carried in outside the five-eighths then switched out, chased four wide around the turn, dropped to the two path
coming to the quarter-pole and tired. PAPI ON ICE made light contact with a foe at the start, moved out inside the three-quarter pole then came under
urging, went five wide on the turn, spun six wide into the stretch, bumped with an opponent near the three-sixteenths and failed to threaten. SEAN THE
HAMMER broke out at the start, went to the front from the outside, moved in inside the three-quarter pole, contested the pace on the outside of a rival, vied
in the three path around the turn and capitulated. TIZA BROWN was urged along on the inside, steadied against the rail at the three-eighths, saved ground
into the stretch and was no factor. GRAND AGAIN was carried in while showing speed inside the three-quarter pole then dropped back, fell further back into
the turn and retreated.

Footnotes
VENTI VALENTINE settled on the outside, was asked in the four path on the turn, gained to make a bid near the five-sixteenths, took the lead into upper
stretch, fought outside of the runner-up into the final furlong, disposed of that foe coming to the sixteenth-pole and proved much the best under steady
urging. KNOW IT ALL AUDREY was hustled from the gate, settled in a good position off the pace, was coaxed along passing the half-mile pole, went
around most of the turn in the two path then dropped to the rail, made an inside bid coming to the quarter-pole, fought with the winner into the final furlong
and proved no match while well clear for the place. SPUNGIE moved out while urged along off the pace, went five wide around the turn and came up empty
while best of the rest. LET HER INSPIRE U tracked the pace on the outside, was given her cue in the three path on the turn, made a bid at the
five-sixteenths, dropped back in upper stretch and capitulated. MASHNEE GIRL was hustled to the front, showed the way down the backstretch, was asked
in the two path on the turn, lost the lead at the quarter-pole and gave way. FIGHT ON LUCY was squeezed back while in tight between foes early, moved
out at the rear, was coaxed along on the outside, dropped in late on the backstretch, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.

Footnotes
SAINT EROS GIRL five then four wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide for home, rallied to issue a challenge through
the final furlong taking narrow command a sixteenth out, then dug in gamely to prevail at the end. ALPINE QUEEN hustled from the gate, showed the way in
hand three then two wide through swift splits safely in command, got let out cornering just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under growing threat to the
outside and was collared a sixteenth from home, fought on to the finish to be betsed by neck. MIA BEA STAR broke out at the start trading a bump with
CHARLEY RUDE then got forced to steady conceding two to three lengths in position, chased just off the inside down the backstretch and then along the
inside through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch kicked on belatedly closing well to secure the
show honors at the finish. CHARLEY RUDE broke in at the start trading a bump with MIA BEA STAR, chased four paths off the inside until tucked inside
through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and tipped out to the four or five path straightened
away, then ran on one paced to the finish. TRUE EMPRESS three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled seven wide into upper
stretch and offered no response. DEVILLY chased five to six wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and tired.
SURCHARGE chased just off the inside under coaxing from three furlongs out, spun two to three wide for home, tired in the stretch.

Footnotes
SHERIFF BIANCO was hustled from the gate, chased the pace on the outside then four wide on the turn, gained five wide to take the lead into upper stretch
then kicked clear, drifted in coming to the furlong marker and held under steady urging. KING ANGELO was hustled from the start, showed speed between
horses then chased the pace, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch, pursued the winner in the drive and finished with
good courage for the place. TWELTH MAN came away a step slow, was urged along on the outside, gained five to six wide on the turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, pursued the winner into the final furlong and flattened out while well clear for the show. PRISONER bumped with a rival at the start
then was hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, lost the advantage in the two path into upper stretch and gave
way. VIDAL pressed the pace on the outside under urging, vied in the three path around the turn, passed the five-sixteenths on even terms for the lead,
came out in upper stretch and tired. MAURITIUS bumped with a rival at the start, was taken in hand while in a bit tight early, settled off the pace, was taken
in hand again near the nine-sixteenths, went three wide while roused on the turn and failed to rally. JESTER'S SONG came outward while off a step slow
then was hustled, was urged along off the pace, dropped from five to four wide around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
TAPIT TRICE broke a beat slow getting away last, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper
stretch, rallied and had the leader come out in front at the three-sixteenths and the eight pole and altered out slightly in response, latched on and got
bumped inside the eighth pole as SLIP MAHONEY came out under a left handed crop, got bumped again a sixteenth from home when head to head as that
rival came out under a left handed stick once more, seized narrow command undeterred and gamely prevailed on the wire. SLIP MAHONEY prompted the
leader from the outside four then three wide advancing to take command with seven-sixteenths to go, briefly tussled with SUMMER CAUSE before
establishing sole command through the latter portion of the turn, spun two to three wide for home, dug in under left handed crop coming outwards at the
three-sixteenths and eighth pole, had the aforementioned foe latch on outside and came out twice more under a left handed stick to bump that rival inside
the eighth pole and a sixteenth from home, got headed nearing the finish while battling on but was ultimately bested at the end. SUMMER CAUSE coaxed
from the gate, raced just off the inside in close aim of the front, tucked inside through the turn and was heads apart for command from the seven-sixteenths
to near the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages while along for the show honors clear of the rest.
MERCANTE chased three to four wide down the backstretch before being tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five
wide into upper stretch and weakened. GOOD RAPPORT chased inside briefly before tipping two then three wide down the backstretch, went back inside
through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five wide into upper stretch and tired. MY IMAGINATION stumbled at the break veering
inwards when recovering and was corrected, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired. WINNING
CONNECTION showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from a trio and then a pair, yielded with seven-sixteenths to go, retreated
through the turn and went seven wide into upper stretch, then folded in the drive. ABSTRACT three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the
seven-sixteenths, went three to four wide into upper stretch and trailed.

forward position early, moved out inside the three-quarter pole, ranged up four wide on the turn, made a bid near the five-sixteenths, led briefly into upper
stretch then lost the advantage to the winner and proved no match while able to get the place. LIFETIME OF CHANCE was coaxed along towards the front,
dropped back with five furlongs to run, went three wide on the turn, was driven six wide into upper stretch and narrowly earned the show.
PLAYINGWITHMATCHES drifted out some leaving the chute, showed the way down the backstretch, vied in the two path while challenged on the turn, lost
the advantage into upper stretch and weakened then just lost the show. BUSTINO SANTINO leaned in at the start then bumped with a foe, moved up under
urging, chased inside through the turn, angled out in upper stretch and came up empty. ZAPRUDER jostled with a foe just after the start, was urged along
off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, came five wide into upper stretch and failed to threaten. JACKSON HEIGHTS bumped with a rival at the
start, raced at the rear, moved from the rail to the three path around the turn and was no factor. VACATION DANCE chased the pace on the outside, made
a bid leaving the backstretch, vied three wide on the turn and capitulated. INCANTATION broke near the back of the field, was urged along well off the pace,

Footnotes
SARATOGA BANKER showed the way in hand three then two wide under pressure from a pair early on and then CAMM' DUKE through the turn, came
under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three wide for home, edged clear under a drive kept to task. TWO CHUCKLES lunged at the start getting away
last, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven to eight wide into upper stretch and closed well to just get up for the place honors in
the final jumps while never threatening the winner. CHASIN' YOU coaxed from the gate, chased two to three, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and
angled in to take the inside route into upper stretch, then offered up a mild kick through to the finish and was nailed for the place honors on the wire. CAMM'
DUKE broke out at the start under hustling, pressed the pace of SARATOGA BANKER from the outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the
five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch, got shaken off straightened away and weakened in the final furlong. SOMAMA BEACH broke in at the
start, chased six then five wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no late headway. M. C. DOUBLE
R coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued in the two path into upper stretch and tired. LIOTTA
hustled from the start, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and tired. JOYFUL GHOST
hustled from the gate, chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and tired. HOT ROD LINCOLN
chased three to four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and tired.
