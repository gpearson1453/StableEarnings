LIAM'S BLUE MOON stumbled while breaking alertly, hustled to the front, repelled challenges, moved clear and lasted. SENSIBLE JIM pursued outside, bid
on the final turn then made a gradual late gain. DEPLANE trailed early inside, angled out in the stretch and closed well. STEVIE T lacked speed, failed to
respond and flattened out in the stretch. LOUIE'S LAW saved ground within range, moved closer before the half inside and faded. EMPEROR'S CAUSE
chased in the two path and weakened steadily. C C GOLDRUSH flashed speed outside then stopped losing contact with his field.

Footnotes
BROADWAYCHARLYROSE raced off the pace on the inside, stalked the leader on the turn, rallied outside that rival entering the stretch, dug in gamely
outside, wore down EQUISTAR at the sixteenth marker and pulled away late. EQUISTAR showed good early speed and opened up to set the pace,
responded when roused turning for home, dug in gamely, then was no match for the winner and clear for the place spot. HOP ON ME was fractious and
reluctant to load, raced off the pace inside, chased inside on the turn and rallied mildly inside for third. TIPSY GIRL raced off the pace, moved up three wide
on the turn and flattened out in the lane. ARROGANTE was outrun. PRIZE DEBATE stalked the pace, chased between rivals on the turn and gave way.

half a mile then proved no match for the winner. COMMISSIONER DAVE lagged far behind then advanced inside to gain the show. MY BROTHER NEIL
prompted the pace three wide then proved empty in the stretch. WILL TAKE CONTROL saved ground close up for three quarters and faltered. AMERICAN
FORCES raced along the inside and gave way readily. MR. BRIGGS dueled briefly inside then stopped after half a mile. LAWLESSNESS raced in midpack
and faded readily. D BLACK MAMBA lacked speed and stopped abruptly losing contact with his field.

on the turn, split rivals into the stretch, loomed a threat but could not get by the winner. EMPRESS ARIANA stalked the pace outside, moved closer on the
turn then flattened out. WARRIOR'S RANSOM lacked speed racing four wide, remained wide and failed to rally. MADELINE'S GROGU broke a step slowly,
rushed up inside then gave way in the stretch.

Footnotes
THIS ROUND'S MINE stalked close up two wide, made a strong bid on the turn, took charge, drew clear, drifted out a bit and held well under urging.
VITAEMI set the pace on the inside, responded when challenged, dug in gamely through the lane and battled to the end. HIGHTIME VALENTINE raced
three wide off the pace, came five wide into the lane and rallied mildly outside. STARSHIP ROGUE raced off the pace inside, chased on the turn, continued
inside in the stretch and lacked a rally. MINDING MILLIE raced two wide off the pace, came two wide into the lane, lacked a rally and finished evenly.
EXCITABLE LADY raced off the rail, off the pace, came three wide into the lane and finished evenly. WHYISSHESOOLUCKY raced off the pace inside,
continued on the rail in the stretch and failed to threaten. JET FORCE stalked the pace, chased on the turn and faded.

Footnotes
JUMP SHOT hustled to clear lead inside, repelled a challenge, widened in midstretch and held on gamely. FLOAT ON stalked the pace outside, went after
the winner on the turn, then made a gradual gain while finishing willingly. PORTAL ONE raced between rivals off the pace then flattened out in the stretch.
GOLDEN SPOKE saved ground off the pace and continued well while no threat. NIMBLE BEAST lunged at the start then was taken up soon after, raced
wide and faded. YES IT'S ROO was taken up off heels into the far turn and no factor. AHSAD was in tight between rivals into the far turn and had no further
response. OFF THE MEDS dropped back after the start and trailed throughout.
