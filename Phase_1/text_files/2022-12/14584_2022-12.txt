Footnotes
NO ME DIGAS checked into the first turn on the inside, then was in tight on the backstretch by the half mile marker, then settled into stride on the turn and
eased off the inside and made a three wide bid by the quarter pole, then hit the front in the furlong grounds and prevailed late to prove best, driving.
SECRET SANCTUARY was six wide into the first turn, then was rated along five wide, made a three wide move on the turn and took over leaving the turn,
then dug in gamely when confronted by the winner and battled on but missed late. SEE OUT vied for the lead and made a inside bid on the turn but
weakened in the drive, held show award. I'M NOT A BABY was allowed to settle early, advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out in the lane and
finished with interest but needed more, missed show award. FIRE AT MIDNIGHT was allowed to settle early, then was five to six wide by the quarter pole
and improved late. OBOY vied for the lead three wide and weakened. DEVIL'S CANYON was off slowly, then chased the pace between rivals, made a bid
on the turn but tired. BYRON'S GOLD was void of early speed and lacked a solid rally. POSITRACTION was settled back early, three to four wide on the
turn and was not a threat. DESTINY JOY chased the pace four wide and stopped.

DIVISIBILITY set the early pace, drew cleafr on the turn and then came off the inside leaving the turn and drew off, then was given one pop right handed
with the crop, then was ridden out and wrapped up late to prove much the best. LIL SPINNER chased the early pace between rivals, then dropped to the
inside on the turn, angled out in the lane and finished well to be clearly seciond best. IMAGINETHEODDS tracked the early pace and made a mild bid on
the inside on the turn, but lacked a late response while besting the rest. ELLIE VICTORINA was rated along early and made a mild bid four wide on the turn
but was empty in the lane. LOVE NOTION was bumped at the start, stalked the winner three wide and weakened. ALWAYS FORWARD was off a step slow
and squeezed back at the start, then was not a threat. LUNITA was bumped at the start, chased the pace three wide and tired. BUTTERMILK GIRLZ

DANCER'S MELODY was off a step slow, chased the pace and made a four wide move on the turn, came five wide into the lane and closed on the outside
to wear down rival to get up to prove best under a drive. SHACKLEFORD COUNTY stalked the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn, gained
the lead leaving the furlong marker but could not hold off the winner late, second best. DOMINEER set the early pace and was headed nearing the furlong
marker and faded. MS. MALEVOLENCE was settled early and raced wide on the turn and had no response. THEA'S THEME was settled early and saved
ground and was not a factor.

QUICK TEMPO dueled for the lead on the outside, made a bid nearing the quarter pole to shake clear, then drew off leaving the turn and widened the
margin to prove much the best, mild urging. BIGMANCAN was reserved early, saved ground on the turn and then rallied well for the place award on the
inside. KOZY'S WILDCAT dueled for the lead on the inside, then shifted off the inside leaving the turn and proved to be no match for the winner and lost the
place award late. THE SICARII bobbled at the break, regrouped and was reserved early, two wide on the turn and angled out in the lane, belated rally.
GIRLS LOVE ME was settled early, then was four to five wide on the turn and weakened. VALIANT VINNY chased the pace on the inside and weakened.
WILD BEHAVIOR stalked the pace three wide and was ridden along on the turn and then was empty in the drive. MONTAUK DADDY stumbled at the start,
chased the pace three wide and tired.

Footnotes
TIZ NO CLOWN stalked the early pace four wide, made a three wide bid on the turn to loom boldly leaving the turn, then had a long drive with LOST
WEEKEND, was bumped by that rival nearing the sixteenth marker and then prevailed late to prove best under a drive. LOST WEEKEND dueled for the
lead on the inside, made a bid leaving the turn and drifted out, then bumped the winner and had a long drive with that rival, dug in gamely but missed. BYK
did not break sharp, then rushed up the inside but was blocked at the half mile marker, waited on the inside and was shuffled back on the turn, then finished
well on the inside to best the rest. FEELING WOOZY was settled back early, came six wide into the lane and had a belated rally. ICE COLD FROSTY
passed the tiring rivals. JOHNNYFRENCHFRI dueled for the lead two wide and then weakened in the drive. EL TOLU chased the pace three wide and
weakened. MCCRAKENS GHOST chased the early pace in between rivals and tired. JOHN HALL chased the early pace and stopped.

Footnotes
BELLA BETTINA was off a step slow, settled back on the inside, lacked room and had to steady around the three eighths marker, then found room and
advanced on the inside by the quarter pole, angled out leaving the turn and closed full of run to edge away late under a drive. CAUSE TO DREAM pressed
the pace three wide, made a two wide bid leaving the turn and dropped to the inside while clear, but could not hold off the winner late, second best. POET
IN MY HEART chased the early pace, then tracked the front runners on the inside on the turn, shifted out three wide leaving the turn, then lugged in by the
furlong marker and finished evenly, bested rest. POLISH COOKIE was reserved early, came wide into the lane and had a belated rally. MERGER OF
EQUALS chased the pace and was three to four wide on the turn and had no rally. KOBE'S GIRL set a pressured pace along the inside, then dueled for
command by the quarter pole, angled off the inside leaving the turn and weakened. ROSELEE lacked a solid rally. YIRA failed to menace. DAYS
REMEMBERED showed brief foot and weakened. HARPER'S DO was wide on the turn and not a threat. STRUTTIN chased the pace and tired. Due to fog
notes were done to the best of ability as it was difficult to see.
