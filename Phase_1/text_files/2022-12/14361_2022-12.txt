Footnotes
CHELSEA DAGGER tracked three wide at the half mile marker, was nudged along outside to get going five sixteenths from the finish, rallied four wide at the
top of the lane, found his best stride late and was edging away crossing the finish line. JACKIE'S PRIDE dictated the pace down the backstretch, repelled a
brief challenge outside midpoint on the turn to open up mildly turning for home, was caught in deep stretch by the closing winner but held well to hold for
place besting the rest. ROOKIE RADAR chased the pacesetter early on, was taken back off the engaging leaders to a tracking position on the rail running
on the turn, waited inside to rally at the top of the lane, shifted just outside with an eighth to go and could not gain on the top two to the wire. ADELAIDE
COURT pressed the frontrunner just outside throughout the turn, battled between challengers in upper stretch and faded at the furlong marker to settle on
the fringes. AMMUNITION raced between rivals in the trailing group at the half, was hustled with runners on either side with three furlongs remaining to no
avail and was ridden hard to the wire making little impact on the leaders through the lane. EXCEED travelled at the back of the pack on the rail, saved
ground racing inside through the turn and could not get involved in the stretch drive. PASSTHEPUDDINPLEAZ settled near the rear three deep outside of
runners down the backside, offered a brief rally at the quarter pole while widest and tired in mid stretch to be a non factor.

Footnotes
ADMONISH was in a bit tight at the start, settled near mid-pack saving ground on the rail, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out at the top of the
stretch, struck the lead nearing the sixteenth pole and drove clear under steady handling. JOLENE JOLENE raced up close tracking inside on or just off the
rail, moved out three wide coming past the quarter, took over by the three-sixteenths, was clear briefly then challenged by the winner and outkicked by that
one. COURTINGCOURTNEY was forced in at the start then mildly encouraged forward but lacking significant early speed, raced two to three wide on the
first turn off the pace, swung eight wide turning for home, drifted in a bit in the lane, was best of the rest. REINS OF PURPLE settled off the pace outside
three to four wide early, moved out from four to five wide on the far turn, came into upper stretch seven deep, drifted in a bit and ran on. MOON POOL was
unhurried at the rear racing inside, still last but one coming to the quarter pole while moving out, swung six wide into the stretch, kicked on mildly. CALL ME
KITTY stalked up close outside three to four wide, moved out a bit late on the far turn still just off the leaders but lacked the needed late kick. TENPENNY
NAIL broke inwardly, raced mid-pack two to three wide early, lost some ground three to four deep on the far turn, failed to rally. CLIFF'S HEAD moved clear
and shifted in to set the pace, faced pressure from an outside rival up the backstretch racing just off the rail, shook free of that one entering the far turn, was
collared by the top of the stretch and came up empty. PRACTICAL GIZMO was forwardly-positioned early, allowed a rival to go on with the lead, moved up
outside that one heading up the backstretch three wide to press, faded. LUNATICA raced at the rear and was never a threat.

Footnotes
UNILATERAL trailed the field in the beginning, took closer order to the pack with a half mile to run, circled three wide with three eighths to go, loomed boldly
five wide for the stretch drive and was full of run to the wire taking over at the sixteenths pole to inch away at the finish. BATTLE OF YORKTOWN tracked
just off the fence outside in the early stages, contested for the front while widest three deep entering the final turn, assumed command at the quarter marker,
dug in stubbornly in the lane and was caught by the closing winner giving away grudgingly the last sixteenth. FACTOTUM took command from the start on
the rail, battled when challenged outside on the far turn, fought determinedly on the fence through the stretch and gave way to the top two in deep stretch to
settle for the show award. KODIAK MAMBA (IRE) stalked three wide into the first turn, settled near the rear running down the backside, was roused
between horses at the three eighths marker, angled out to the five path for the stretch run and had good late energy to close in for a minor share.
BODACIOUS BIZ had a good tracking position inside running well in hand down the backstretch, was asked to quicken with the leaders into the final turn,
offered little effort and finished evenly on the wrong lead through the stretch. AHMAS raced four wide into the first turn, settled in the middle of the pack
down the backside, put in a mild run three furlongs from the wire to be in the mix for a small share four wide at the top of the lane and stalled between foes
the final eighth. QUIET REBEL travelled in midfield inside early on, was shuffled back on the rail at the half, lost ground to his competitors racing on the
fence through the far turn and could not make an impression running to the finish. TARA TATTOO hesitated a touch at the start, chased the frontrunner
under a good hold down the backstretch, pressed between foes at the half, battled for the top spot with rivals on either side on the far turn, gave way two
furlongs from home and stopped in mid stretch.

Footnotes
AIRY FAIRY gained forward position from the start, was in a bit tight in behind runners two to three wide heading to the turn, moved nearer the rail early on
the turn, bid inside in upper stretch taking command by the eighth pole and drew clear. MUMBLEBEE moved clear to set the pace racing just off the rail,
was overtaken in mid-stretch but held the place. BORN TO BE GOOD came out a bit at the start, raced off the pace near mid-pack about two to three wide,
angled seven wide turning for home, was gaining too late and missed second. PIPESTONE was urged at the break, chased three wide into the turn, failed
to rally for the drive. ROSE RING stalked from just off the leaders, went five wide on the turn, ran on but missed the superfecta. ROYAL CITY REIGN raced
mid-pack about four wide on the turn, came out nine deep turning for home and ran on. WEST PAW saved ground on or just off the rail racing off the pace,
ran on mildly. STORMY SUZIE swung ten wide into the stretch and failed to menace. CLASSIC QUEEN was reserved in the early going, swung eleven
wide, was never near enough to threaten. GORMLEY GIRL chased from inside, steadily retreated. TAPITURE WAY was in a bit tight after the break, failed
to threaten. STORM GAUGE chased from outside three to four wide, dropped back and faded.

Footnotes
TICKLE HER TOE chased five wide leaving the chute, battled outside for the lead on the turn, began to creep away from his pace rival in mid stretch and
finally was drawing away nearing the wire. BEN'S SUNNY ISLAND broke well to set the pace just up front down the backside with multiple challengers
threatening, continued on the lead fighting for the top spot on the rail throughout the turn, stubbornly fought on the fence in upper stretch but needed more
late. GAV'S DREAM GIRL tracked two wide in the beginning, had a good position inside just behind the dueling frontrunners with three eighths to go, shifted
out three wide at the eighth pole and was closing in but could not threaten for the win or place at the wire. MY GIRL HOOTER contested the pace two deep
in the front foursome at the half mile marker, was shuffled back losing some position entering the far turn between runners, regrouped to rally at the quarter
pole and levelled out slightly in mid stretch to hold for a small reward. DELIGHTFUL DREAMER stalked close to the back of the pack in the beginning, was
ridden for more three wide midway on the turn, began to pick up rivals two furlongs out and passed tired foes outside down the stretch. CARLA'S HONOR
had a brief run passing horses with a half remaining, stalled while widest four deep midpoint on the turn and offered only an even finish to the wire.
INSPECTOR RELOAD stalked in the middle of the field between rivals at the half mile marker, could not keep pace with the pack while being urged on the
turn and had little energy racing to the finish line. ORIGINAL ME settled near the back down the backside and could not get interested racing through the
turn. ABSOLUTE JEWEL was up close to the pace early on, had to be steadied briefly losing her inside path running down the backside, offered a three
wide run between foes with three eighths remaining, gave way four wide at the top of the stretch and faltered at the furlong marker. HALO STYLE was
unhurried early on, advanced mildly on the rail through the turn and could be a factor inside running down the lane.

Footnotes
VEERY moved forward with moderate encouragement early, set the tempo racing off the rail, drew away when asked, was mildly ridden late. VALLEY GIRL
raced off the pace going two to three wide on the turn, came out four wide for the drive, was no match but second best. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD was off the
leaders inside, moved out past the five-sixteenths, split rivals in upper stretch, evened out. HIT AND RUN brushed with a rival up the backstretch, went four
wide on the turn about mid-pack, swung out six wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly. LOAD ABROAD chased from between runners mid-pack, went two to
three wide on the turn, failed to rally. D'S SOUL chased four wide, weakened. SPARKLE SAMMY chased from inside, weakened. IMA DAREDEVIL brushed
with a rival up the backstretch, was caught five wide on the turn, was forced seven wide into upper stretch, had no late bid. MY FINAL TRICK chased
outside the eventual winner three wide, came up empty.

Footnotes
TAKOTA broke in at the start, between runners was patiently handled while on hold entering the turn, was coaxed for run at the five sixteenths pole,
responded well to bid four wide at the top of the lane and was full of run late to win opening up on the field in the end. ARRA GO WAN broke sharp to lead
them all down the backstretch, continued to dictate the pace running on the turn, was headed outside by the eventual winner in mid stretch, ran on gamely
to the finish but was just second best today. GIZMO'S B F F tracked the leaders on the rail entering the turn, advanced smartly up the fence two furlongs
from the prize, was in with a chance when they turned for home and chased willingly inside through the lane settling for the show money. DANGER tracked
in the three path midfield with horses on either side at the half mile marker, was steadied sharply racing in tight surroundings with seven sixteenths
remaining, recovered to contend four wide at the top of the stretch and tried to reel in the leaders but to no avail in the late stages of the race. HELLO
FRIENDS stalked near the back of the field just off the fence in the early stages, started to gain momentum midway on the turn and found her best stride in
the final furlong running well between competitors to the finish line. IMA BEAST tried to press the issue with the pacesetter running just outside through the
turn, could not match strides with the outside rallying winner three wide at the quarter pole and retreated at the furlong marker. BILLYJANE settled in mid
pack four deep down the backside, was pushed out mildly by a steadying rival at the three eighths pole, was roused two furlongs from home, angled to the
six path in upper stretch and could not get into contention through the lane. STERLING SPEED trailed the field on the rail down the backstretch, saved
ground inside through the turn and never was a presence running through the stretch.
