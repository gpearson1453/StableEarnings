Footnotes
KOOL KATHMANDU lunged some while breaking on even terms for the front, displayed good speed from the outside, controlled the action in the two path
around the turn, responded well when roused near the quarter-pole, drew off under two pops of the crop in upper stretch, raced under a solid hand-ride from
the furlong marker to the sixteenth-pole then was eased up while much the best. FAST BOAT TO SKYE broke out and bumped hard with a foe, bumped
lightly with a rival shortly thereafter, moved out then chased the pace, went around the turn in the four path, pursued the winner into upper stretch and
proved no match while clear for the place. VENGE was bumped hard at the start then dropped back while taken up some, went two then three wide around
the turn, shifted four wide at the quarter-pole then moved in around the three-sixteenths and was along for the show. PAXSATIONAL climbed badly for
several strides outside the five-eighths, was urged along on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch and failed to threaten.
CLUBHOUSE bumped lightly with a foe after the start, was sent hard then chased the pace, shifted out at the half-mile pole, went three wide on the turn,
moved to five wide into the stretch and tired. LOGIN REQUIRED broke a step slow then bobbled some and dropped back, angled to the rail early, moved up
with a half-mile to run, saved ground around the turn and came up empty.

Footnotes
SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN coaxed from the gate, raced five paths off the inside down the backstretch detached at the tail of the field, came under light
coaxing half a mile from home and tucked three wide through the turn, advanced and went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge
through the final furlong taking command with seventy yards to the finish, then edged away to prevail. GAME THEORY showed the way in hand three then
two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home, dug in under a drive and was collared seventy yards from the finish, held on
to preserve the place honors on the wire. SWEET MIA chased two to three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four wide into upper stretch,
ran on to miss for the place honors. CHAYSENBRYN coaxed from the gate, chased three then two wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, angled
five wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CHLOE ROSE chased three to four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five to
six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MON PETIT CHOU coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside, tipped out three then four
wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went six wide into upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
CEES GET DEGREES came away in front, disputed the pace on the outside of a rival, vied in the three path around the turn, shook clear into upper stretch,
drew off under a drive into the final furlong and proved much the best while kept to the task. COUSIN ANDREW dropped back under urging near the
five-eighths then moved out, angled in late on the backstretch, traveled around the turn in the two path, gained late on that bend, swung five wide into the
stretch and safely secured the place. UPPER LEVEL broke in then bumped lightly with a foe, contested the pace on the inside of the winner, vied inside to
the two path on the turn, dropped back into upper stretch then moved out and weakened while clear for the show. JET SPEED was ridden along off the
pace, dropped back four then five wide on the turn and lacked the needed response. HOLEY MATRIMONY broke a half-step slow, settled on the outside,
was roused five then six wide on the turn, came seven wide into the stretch and failed to respond. HATCH brushed with a foe at the start, chased the pace
towards the inside, went two then three wide around the turn, was driven four wide into the stretch and capitulated. OUTASITE broke through the front of the
gate prior to the start, bumped lightly with a foe at the break, steadied briefly early, moved up under urging, went three then four wide on the turn, dropped
back six wide into the stretch, drifted in around the furlong marker and faltered.

Footnotes
SILVER SKILLET was hustled to the front, showed the way under some pressure to her outside, moved clear outside the half-mile pole, extended the
advantage in the two path around the turn, was roused in the three path into the stretch, drew off under a very mild hand-ride into the final furlong and won
handily while geared down. LAVON settled at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, hugged the fence from that point to the wire
and earned the place while no match for the winner. THE SPLENDID ONE chased the pace on the outside, went five to six wide on the turn and missed the
place while clear for the show. LA CONQUISTADORA pressed the pace on the outside, dropped back nearing the half-mile pole, went four wide on the turn
and tired. MISS BARB climbed some outside the three-quarter pole, was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and was no factor.
MISS FASHIONISTA was urged along on the far outside, dropped from six to four wide around the turn, floated back to six wide into the stretch and showed
little. MISCHIEVOUS MOLLY dropped off the pace, came up empty in the three path on the turn and faltered.

Footnotes
LORD GATLING pressed the early pace, dropped back nearing the nine-sixteenths, went two to three wide for most of the turn, shifted four wide late on that
bend, gained five wide into the stretch, took the lead at the three-sixteenths, fought outside of the runner-up in the final furlong and narrowly prevailed.
GOOD SKATE pressed the early pace on the outside, took the lead with five furlongs to run, vied in the two then three path around the turn, drifted out while
losing the advantage to the winner into upper stretch, fought on well inside of that opponent to the wire but just missed while clear for the place. FUNNY
JOKE was hustled from the gate, moved out while off the pace, was asked to advance outside the half-mile pole, went three then four wide for most of the
turn, moved to five wide outside the quarter-pole and earned the show while no match for the top two. SALUTE TO AMERICA broke in some then brushed
with a foe, was urged along at the rear, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. PRINTRACK
brushed with a rival at the start, set the pace under pressure to his outside, lost the lead at the five-eighths, vied inside on the turn, dropped back into upper
stretch and tired. CATCHING CUPID broke out then hit the gate and was last to commence, raced on the outside while coaxed along, went four then five

SWEET SURPRISE eight paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked four wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, went
seven wide into upper stretch, rallied angling inwards to take command just inside the eighth pole, dug in tussling with the runner up before gamely
prevailing at the end. MY SWEET WIFE coaxed from the start, dueled four then two wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun three wide for home,
was in the midst of taking command when headed by the aforementioned foe just inside the eighth pole, fought on to the finish to be along clear of the rest
for the place honors. FLASHNDYNAMITE dueled six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coaxed along from the
three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch, inched away under a drive to the eighth pole, yielded just inside that station and weakened in the
late stages. VIENNA CODE five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at the
three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. JANE GREY bobbled at the break, raced seven paths off the inside down the
backstretch and then four wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and tired. FIRENZE FREEDOM took the overland route nine to ten
paths off the inside down the backstretch and then five wide through the turn, went seven wide into upper stretch and made no impact. CHOOSE
HAPPINESS stumbled at the start, chased four then three wide down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn, went four wide into upper
stretch and trailed throughout.
