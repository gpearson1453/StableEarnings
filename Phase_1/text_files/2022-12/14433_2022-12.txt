Footnotes
JACK LUVS NOVA raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two and three path, began a bid nearing the quarter
pole, gained ground outside and pulled clear late. ROAD BIBLE led the field up the backstretch, continued to show the way while saving ground around the
turn, was caught in upper stretch and kept on to the wire. MR LIGHTNING BOY chased the leader through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground
around the turn and finished evenly. NO COMMISSION hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never
threatened. AS DE ORO COCO raced off the pace on the outside early, navigated the turn from the two path and tired in the lane.

Footnotes
CHUCKY dueled on the outside up the backstretch, edged clear while racing in the two path around the turn, dueled down the lane and got the bob for the
victory. LITIGANT had his head turned and was held for a moment at the break, resulting in a slow beginning, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved
ground around the turn, offered a bid approaching the quarter pole and dueled down the lane to just miss. UNCLE ANDREW chased the leaders up the
backstretch on the inside, came around the turn in the three path and finished evenly. ROOKIE SALSA raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the turn from the four path and improved position mildly in the lane. SEVENTY SEVENTYCAT raced at the back of the pack on the outside
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and never threatened. CALL BROS dueled on the inside up the backstretch, began to drop back while
racing in the two path around the turn and tired further in the stretch. DOUBLE DAVID tracked the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, raced in the four path around the turn, swung wider still entering the stretch and faded from there. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE
START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HORSE SIX, LITIGANT, DID NOT HAVE A FAIR BEGINNING AND WAS DECLARED A NON
STARTER FOR WAGERING PURPOSES ONLY.

Footnotes
PEEP'S DAY tracked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn and dueled down the stretch to get the head bob
for the win. CHILD PROOF chased the frontrunner on the inside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the two path, and dueled to the wire, narrowly
missing. O ANNIE settled in the middle of the pack on the inside for the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching
the quarter pole and gained ground late. WICKLOW GAL bumped with the horse to her outside leaving the gate, raced in the middle of the pack early,
continued around the turn in the three path and improved position in the lane. ELARY led the field on the inside up the backstretch, continued to show the
way while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the stretch. THE MONEY MACHINE bumped and was shoved back at the break, raced off the
pace in the opening stages, came around the bend in the two path and made a mild improvement of position through the final furlong. HAPPY UNION raced
at the back of the pack on the outside early, began to move up while racing in the four path around the turn and flattened out in the stretch. COLLECTIVE
GOLD stalked the pace setter on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and faded in the lane. AFTER NOON KISSES raced
at the back of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and tired in the stretch. MILK MONEY hopped up
slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and never factored.

Footnotes
ALYANAABI was sent to the early lead while saving ground around the first turn, continued to show the way racing up the backstretch, dueled around the far
turn and in upper stretch and pulled clear in the final furlong. STREET GLIDE raced in the three path early, stalked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn and chased the winner home. DIAL HIM UP raced at the back of pack in the three path
through the opening half mile, continued around the far turn still in the three path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late to the
wire. BUSTIN UP bobbled slightly leaving the gate, recovered to chase the pace setter on the outside around the first turn and up the backstretch, navigated
the far turn from the two path and finished evenly. LORD OF THE NILE saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader on the inside up the
backstretch, challenged from the rail coming around the second bend and weakened in late stretch. STEALTH MISSION raced in the four path around the
first turn, settled in the middle of the pack on the outside for the run up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the far turn, dueled in
upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile. RAGING WHIRLWIND saved ground around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the
middle of the pack on the inside, raced into mild traffic on the rail nearing the quarter pole and flattened out from there. CALZONE raced in the two path
between horses through the opening half mile, navigated the far turn still in the two path and showed no kick. LANCELOT LYNK raced in the two path
around the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, came around the second bend in the three path and made no bid.
OZAH trailed the field from the four path around the first turn and up the backstretch, angled in to save ground around the far turn and was empty in the
stretch.
