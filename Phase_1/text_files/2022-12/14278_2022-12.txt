Footnotes
LILY POO got floated out a bit early then crowded between rivals at the half-mile pole, angled out into the turn and rallied four deep around the bend, dug in
late outside WUDI and proved best in the end. WUDI broke inward then moved clear and crossed over, pressured by outside rivals at the half-mile pole,
coaxed along through the turn holding a short lead, inched clear at the top of the lane, drifted out in deep stretch and yielded to LILY POO in the late stages.
SWEET TROUBLE tossed her head then drifted out early, went up to press the pace from between rivals, fought through the turn, lost touch with the winner
with three-sixteenths remaining and flattened to third. ITZEL broke a step slow, went up to press three deep, fought to the quarter pole then failed to kick on
with the leaders leaving the bend, drifted in the stretch and weakened. MIDNIGHT VOW broke a step slow on the outside, trailed along the rail into the turn,
moved out and came three wide into the stretch and was not a factor. NICELY CURVED had her path taken by WUDI at the start, raced near the back off
the rail, angled in on the turn and failed to menace.

Footnotes
ZOOKEEPER cleared early in the two path then moved inside, opened up on the backstretch, coaxed on the far turn and urged right handed leaving the
bend, remained comfortably in front with a sixteenth remaining, grew weary late but was able to hold on. RICH GOLD was off slow to begin, trailed on the
inside to the far turn, steered out with a quarter mile remaining, exited the far turn four to five wide, closed fast through the final furlong and drew alongside
ZOOKEEPER late but ran out of time. TOP OF MY GAME unhurried in the two path outside a rival, tipped three wide near the quarter pole and four wide
into the stretch and gained the show. LITTLEBROTHERJOEY stalked two wide throughout and lacked a rally. TALTARIATE settled along the rail, tipped the
two path at the quarter pole and lacked further response. SUBURBAN PRINCE was washy approaching the starting gate, off alertly then climbed a bit
before settling into a stalking position on the inside, steadied inside LITTLEBROTHERJOEY near the quarter pole and faded in the lane.

Footnotes
TOP GUN CLASSIC broke out then dropped back to last, trailed outside a rival into the turn, was on the move four, five, then six wide on the turn, engulfed
the top pair with a sixteenth to go and drove clear. STOP AND A TRES away quickly from inside, went up to duel with LAMPY for command, vied with a pair
of rivals then fought with ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) and lost command past the quarter pole, battled back and regained the lead in upper stretch, inched
ahead at the eight pole, led the way into the final sixteenth but was no match for TOP GUN CLASSIC in the late stages. ARGENTINA CRIES (IRE) was
reluctant loading into the gate, drifted in and bumped rival in the beginning, stalked outside a rival three wide into the turn, bid outside the top pair then took
over past the quarter pole, dueled with STOP AND A TRES into the lane, lost the lead in upper stretch, stayed on in the final furlong and held the show.
DORADUS chased on the inside, angled out on the turn and came four wide into the lane and showed a mild response to round out the superfecta.
DRUIDIC got bumped on both sides leaving the gate, stalked two then three wide around the turn and weakened. LAMPY bumped with DRUIDIC twice in
the beginning, went up to grab the lead then dueled outside a rival, vied between foes to the five-sixteenths marker, could not go on with the leaders with a
quarter mile remaining and faded in the lane. HOT ROD JIMMY raced near the back in the early going, rounded the bend two wide and failed to menace.

PRESS ON vied between rivals to the turn, dueled on the inside around the bend, carried a short lead into the final sixteenth and dug in to prevail. TOM'S X
S was off slow to begin, advanced two then three wide on the turn, tipped out in the lane, surged late outside the top pair and missed.
BILLBERNJOEJOHNICK vied three deep up the backstretch, dueled outside PRESS ON around the turn, battled head to head down the lane and finished
gamely between rivals near the wire but lacked the needed late punch. JOHNNY PAYCHECK got crowded between rivals nearing the half-mile pole, stalked
two to three wide into the stretch and could not produce a bid. ORTH stalked the pace on the inside, had to check into the turn then again early on the bend,
tipped two wide around CHIEF COUNCIL and could not rally. CHIEF COUNCIL vied for the lead inside a pair of rivals then steadied early on the turn,
dropped back around the bend and faded.

Footnotes
ANACAPA sped to the front and moved inside, set the pace under pressure in the middle stages, shook free on the far turn and drew away into the stretch,
padded the lead into the final furlong and was geared down late. SMOOTHLIKEBUTTAH was off slow to begin, unhurried at the back on the inside, moved
out on the backstretch and went three deep into the far turn, advanced and came four wide into the stretch, showed late run and whittle the gap on the
winner in the final furlong. SPEED LANE bobbled a bit at the start, went up to press the pace from between rivals, lost contact at the three-eighths pole,
chased three wide into the lane, flattened but was able to finish a clear third. TROUVILLE chased three to four wide around both turns and weakened.
AQUA JULIA showed early speed four then three wide around the clubhouse turn, pressed three deep then chased the leader past the half-mile pole,
dropped back on the far turn and had little left for the drive. ROSE DAWSON stumbled leaving the gate, pulled three wide around the first turn, chased
between on the backstretch, lacked room at the quarter pole and steered to the inside, tried to rally up the fence but was stopped again in upper stretch and
could not regain momentum. TAYET stalked along the inside early, tipped out and took aim two wide leaving the far turn but faded in the drive.

Footnotes
GALLOVIE (GB) pressed the pace from outside, kept the pressure on to the top of the stretch, took over after crossing the eighth pole and put away inner
rival, drifted out in the late stages and lasted over the late rush from DENDERA at the wire. DENDERA got a bit crowded at the start, settled on the inside,
rounded the far turn two wide, angled out in the lane, surged late and missed. STORMING LADY bumped leaving the gate, tracked between rivals in the two
path to the stretch, put to right handed urging in the lane but finished evenly late. LOUD LOUD MUSIC bumped with STORMING LADY in the beginning,
raced in range along the rail, saved ground to the stretch and lacked a late bid. SO MUCH HAPPY sprinted to the front and moved inside, set the pace
under pressure from GALLOVIE (GB), clung to a narrow advantage in upper stretch, relinquished the lead past the eight pole and flattened. VAROMA
brushed at the start, trailed on the inside early, raced outside a rival into the second bend, angled in at the three-sixteenths pole, drifted out in the lane and
failed to threaten. IMPERIAL CREED saved ground throughout and never made an impact. NORTHERN GEM tracked three deep around the first turn,
remained three wide then lost ground on the far turn and chased two wide into the drive and faded. ROSES AND CANDY brushed with VAROMA at the
start, stalked in the three path then three deep on the far turn and faded.

Footnotes
CHOLLY chased off the rail then angled in on the turn, launched a bid from inside and took over late on the bend, cleared at the top of the stretch,
challenged by the runner-up late and gamely prevailed. BAJAN BASHERT broke a step slow, angled to the inside from off the pace, gained through the
turn, tipped out into the lane, rallied from outside and could not get by. NYVAN was closest in pursuit in the early stages, went two wide into the turn then
angled out while gaining on the leader, chased CHOLLY four wide into the lane, bumped at the top of the stretch and faltered in the furlong grounds. LOVE
OUR FAMILY chased four wide into the turn, five wide exiting the bend and lacked the needed response. MISS OBEY came away slow, sat off well off the
rail, went three then four wide on the turn and improved position. SASSY NATURE sped clear and crossed over, led comfortably into the turn, held a
diminishing lead approaching the quarter pole, offered no resistance to CHOLLY late on the bend, bumped with outer rival at the top of the lane and gave
way. SPEAKING SPANGLISH hit the gate and broke a step slow, trailed four wide into the turn, moved down to the two path around the bend and failed to
menace. SMILING AMY broke a step slow, traveled in mid-pack up the backstretch, took the turn four then three wide and came up empty. TURQUOISE
BIKINI was off slow and had to take up at the start, went two wide into the turn, raced near the inside into the stretch and was not a factor.
