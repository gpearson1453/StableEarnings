Footnotes
CROSSING IRIS tracked along the inside, gained place from outer rivals entering the lane, shifted outside of the well clear leader in upper stretch, rallied as
that foe began to tire entering the final furlong, then drove past him with seventy yards to go, and drew clear. BUCK DOLL TAYLOR lunged in and bumped
the gate as well as an inner rival at the start, recovered and rushed to vie after a quarter mile, drew clear entering the turn, opened up turning for home,
maintained a wide margin into the final furlong as an outer CROSSING IRIS gave chase, but was worn down by that foe in the final sixteenth. INSPECTOR
ED bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced at the rear two wide, came into the lane in the five path, stayed on between horses in the final furlong, and
reached an outer rival for show late. HARPES HILL set the pace along the inside early on, but failed to keep pace with an outer rival entering the turn,
chased around the bend before drifting to the six path entering the lane, yet ran on after changing leads, but was caught by an inner rival for show in the
closing stages. ALL TOGETHER chased from the two path, shifted to thef our path entering the lane, but drifted inwardly approaching midstretch, and tired.
TUCKER THE GRUMP brushed an outer rival at the start, saved ground towards the rear, but failed to improve between horses in midstretch. CHIPEEE
chased in the four path, fanned to the seven path entering the lane, and weakened. CHAD'S FLASH bobbled and bumped with an outer rival at the start,
lacked speed in the five path around the turn, came into the lane in the eight path, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
NORAH G stalked the top trio from the five path entering the lane, inched closer to vie leaving the three furlong pole, sparred with an inner NEW DESTINY
in upper stretch while forging an advantage, disposed of that one entering the final sixteenth as an inner rival challenged, and held. EVERLYN'S ANGEL
tracked along the inside while just off of the rail, came into the lane in the four path, shifted in approaching midstretch to attempt a rail bid, then grinded
away to offer a challenge inside of the leader in the final sixteenth, but was kept at bay. NEW DESTINY set the pace inside of a pair of rivals nearing the
turn, battled as another foe joined the fray around the turn, dueled with that one while being headed in upper stretch, but yielded to her and a rail bidder
nearing the final sixteenth. SHES A LUCKY REBEL vied for the lead two wide, then from between horses around the turn, but gave way in midstretch.
HOPEITSMYLUCKYDAY lacked speed in the four path, came into the lane in the six path, and failed to factor. STAR MOMENT prompted the pace three
wide, vied between horses around the turn, but weakened in upper stretch. PARAMOUR was outrun.

Footnotes
BEVERLY PARK set the pace, inched a clear margin while in hand around the turn, then drew off under mild coaxing through upper stretch before being put
to wraps entering the final sixteenth. POPULIST stalked three wide around the turn, vied for place turning for home, secured that position coming to
midstretch, and failed to threaten the leader thereafter. CRYPTOZONIC raced at the rear two wide, then between horses around the turn, shifted outside of
rivals in midstretch, and stayed on for a minor share. D TWO tracked along the inside, but lacked a bid before fading. OPTIMAL COURAGE splayed his
front feet at the start causing him to break a step slowly, raced far back three wide, and moved up. GLENN'S JUMPER acted up just before the start
requiring help from the assist starter, broke multiple lengths slow, pursued from off of the pace four wide while under steady coaxing around the turn, then
failed to sustain progress while lugging inwardly in midstretch. JEB'S LUCKY EIGHT saved ground at the rear, but to no avail. INDIA INK pressed two wide,
chased around the turn, then yielded between horses in upper stretch. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
MEDLEY set the pace inside of a prompting foe, disposed of that one before meeting challenges from a pair of rivals nearing the lane, yet repelled those
foes entering the final furlong, and shook free. SHELLI'S ANGEL broke a beat slow, laid off of the pace in the two path, moved between horses into the far
turn before brushing her way three wide leaving the three furlong pole, ranged up to bid along with her outer counterpart turning for home, but was
simultaneously repelled, battled with that one for place while brushing her again in the final furlong, and prevailed. VALE MALE broke a step slowly at the
start, tracked three wide, got brushed while floated four wide by an inner foe at three furlong pole, sustained progress to bid along with that one turning for
home, but was repelled coming to midstretch, dueled for place while again brushing with that one in the final furlong, but was bested. SKY HIGH SUSAN
trailed in the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and improved. MISS KENNEDY stalked along the inside, chase the leaders while
getting outmoved by outer rivals around the far turn, and faded. LADY CHURCHILL prompted the pace two wide, but weakened between horses turning for
home. THE RIDER OF VALE MALE CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF SHELLI'S ANGEL FOR INTERFERENCE IN THE VICINITY OF THE
THREE FURLONG POLE; BUT THE OBJECTION WAS DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
BRITAIN'S KITTEN tracked along the inside, shifted off of the rail while pursuing the clearing leader turning for home, tipped outside of him in upper stretch,
grinded away while being herded out by that drifting rival through midstretch, sustained a bid to challenge in the final sixteenth, and forged an advantage at
the wire. SUTHERLAND prompted the pace inside of a rival before decidedly switching outside of him nearing the backstretch, pressed before vying around
the far turn, cleared nearing the lane, then gradually, yet steadily, drifted out through midstretch while an outer BRITAIN'S KITTEN pursued, met that foe's
bid a sixteenth from home, and got caught at the wire. LIFE IS A BANQUET vied for the lead two wide before clearing an inner rival around the first turn, but
was headed by that foe approaching the final five sixteenths, and gave way in upper stretch. UN OJO shied mildly from an inner foe soon after the start,
pursued from off of the pace two wide, but was done early.

Footnotes
KUPUNA tracked two to three wide around the first turn, moved forward to press the leader from the three path down the backstretch, gained an advantage
while well in hand leaving the three furlong pole, cleared nearing the lane before shifting to the five path entering it, held sway from a group of chasers
through upper stretch, and edged away through the final furlong. BRIGHT SPARK rated at the rear along the inside, fanned out to the seven path leaving
the quarter pole, ten stayed on while hanging on his left lead to reach place at the sixteenth marker. RICKY BOBBY laid off the pace in the three path, got
floated to the six path by an inner BRIGHT SPARK entering the lane, then stayed on late while chasing that foe home, and reached show nearing the wire.
GUNTOWN stalked three to two wide around the first turn before losing status as the leader's closest pursuer entering the backstretch, chased the top pair
around the far turn, attempted a bid inside of the leader in upper stretch, but yielded at the furlong grounds. GLOBAL SENSATION set the pace, felt
pressure from the eventual winner down the backstretch, got headed at the three furlong pole, yielded to that foe turning for home, then weakened inside of
rivals at the furlong grounds. FRENCH COMPOSER stalked along the inside while under a snug hold around the first turn, then chased around the far turn
before fading turning for home.

AMBER CASCADE stalked along the inside, smoothly tipped outside of the leader entering the far turn to bid with three furlongs to go, led turning for home,
then drew off under driving pressure. SPARTAN QUEEN settled off of the pace four wide, inched closer in the four to five path around the far turn, then
sustained her rally to reach place approaching the wire. LOVIN' ON THE RUN set the pace along the inside, but was headed by that eventual winner
approaching the five sixteenths pole, yielded to that foe in upper stretch, and lost place in the closing stages. GHOSTLY GIRL laid off of the pace two wide
before tucking to the rail entering the backstretch, saved ground around the far turn, and ran on for a minor share. NANCY SPAIN settled far back two wide
and between horses, shifted out to the five path entering the lane, and moved up. VIVACIOUSLY tracked in the four to three path around the first turn while
outside of the loose horse, backed off entering the backstretch, but came under coaxing two wide at the nine sixteenths pole, chased among foes around
the far turn, and failed to menace. OH POLLYANNA checked behind the loose horse entering the first turn, saved ground off of the pace, awaited racing
room around the far turn, and made little impact. BADGELAND trailed three wide, and was outrun. SHE'S JERSEY TUFF pressed two wide, but yielded
entering the far turn, and weakened between horses while drifting tot he four path at the five sixteenths pole. COMPARATIVE bobbled before ducking
inwardly and tossing her rider at the start, pursued from midpack without causing much interference before bearing to the outer fence into the far turn, and
was gathered by an out-rider in upper stretch before walking off.

Footnotes
A MO REAY brushed with an inner rival at the start, tracked two wide, pursued the clearing leader from the three path around the far turn, took aim on her
from the four path entering the lane, ranged up to bid approaching midstretch, and drove clear entering the final sixteenth. FREE LIKE A GIRL pressed
outside of the leader, led into the far turn, cleared around that bend as A MO REAY pursued, dug in approaching midstretch to resist that foe's bid, but was
outkicked leaving the furlong grounds, gave way through the final sixteenth, yet saved place at the wire. TROBAIRITZ laid off of the pace along the inside,
ranged up in the four path around the far turn before coming in the lane in the six path, yet only managed to chase the leading inner pair through midstretch,
closed in on place late, but came up just short to reach that position. BLISSFUL broke a bit out at the start, stalked along the inside, but was outmoved by a
pair of outer rivals entering the far turn, shifted of of the rail to surpass a tiring foe entering the lane, but failed to menace from the inside thereafter. ELLE
OF THE BALL set the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the far turn, and weakened turning for home. DRESSED broke a beat slowly while
bumping with an outer foe and taking back from tight quarters at the start, then was outrun.

Footnotes
JACK HAMMER prompted the pace two wide, dueled around the turn while forging an advantage came into the lane in the five path, wandered about while
maintaining a margin from his inner game counterpart through midstretch, and drove clear through the final sixteenth. Z RESURRECTION set the pace
inside of the eventual winner, sparred while getting headed at the three furlong pole, battled on gamely through midstretch, but gave way at the sixteenth
pole. KING'S LUTE tracked along the inside, shifted outwardly in upper stretch while vying with an outer rival for show, and secured that position at the
furlong grounds. CALICOCO chased two wide, fanned to the six path entering the lane, and gave way. STIFF DRINK acted up in the starting gates, lagged
behind in the three path, swung to the seven path entering the lane, and moved up. RANCH WATER raced far back in the four path, and was outrun.
FLASH N CLASS lacked speed in the three path, and faded.

Footnotes
FOREST CHIMES tracked in midpack in the two path, tipped outside of the leading trio and to the five path turning for home, ranged up while drifting to the
six path entering the lane, sustained a bid to sweep past the leaders at the three sixteenths pole, and drew off thereafter. GRAPES FOR ELOISE tracked
three wide and from the four path around the turns, bid in upper stretch as an outer FOREST CHIMES loomed a danger, got outkicked by that foe at the
three sixteenths pole, then kept on to secure place in the final furlong. WATCH THIS MUNNY tracked along the inside, then chased along the rail to reach
show late. OATH OF ALLEGIANCE stalked the clear leader from the three path, but was outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, got put to tight
quarters among the leaders leaving the quarter pole, lost position in the after math, yet kept on thereafter to miss reaching show. WINDY BAY set a clear
pace in the two path, shifted out when confronted by outer rivals leaving the quarter pole, but proved no match for her widest challenger at the three
sixteenths pole, and gave way. LADY WITH A CAUSE broke a step slowly, trailed into the far turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch, and moved up
outside of rivals. MO SHIRO leaned in while off a beat slow at the start, raced far back two wide, floated to the seven path in upper stretch, and lacked a
rally. CATHERINE BLAZE saved ground far back, but to no avail. SHE'S LOOKIN LUCKY lacked speed in the three path, and faded in the four path around
the far turn. GRACEFUL UNION bobbled and shied from an inner rival, laid far back in the four to three paths, and weakened.
