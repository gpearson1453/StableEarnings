FIGHTING FORCE pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, kicked clear near the eighth pole and
drew off to the wire from there. CATCHING FISH dueled on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, dropped back to chase the leaders while
saving ground around the turn and ran on again to improve position in the stretch. BAZOO dueled between horses up the backstretch, continued to battle
from the two path coming around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. ESPECIALLEA raced off the pace early, saved ground around the turn and
never threatened. JAG trailed the field throughout, saved ground around the bend and was empty.

the stretch. WIND TRYST chased the leaders on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and kept on to the wire.
FIRST FAITH pressed the pace on the inside in the early going, gave way while racing in the two path around the turn and finished evenly from there. MY

INVADER trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and made no bid. A PERFECT SET raced into mild traffic in the early

Footnotes
GIRLS IN CHARGE chased the leader up the backstretch, continued pursuit of that rival from the two path around the turn, challenged in upper stretch,
pulled clear and held that margin to the finish. SNACKSTER raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, navigated the turn from the three path,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. JLO CAN DANCE veered in leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the inside for the run
up the backstretch, came around the turn in the two path and improved position in late stretch. CHECK THE GRADE showed the way up the backstretch,
extended her lead while saving ground around the turn and weakened in the final furlong. NURSE JUDY raced in the middle of the pack on the outside
early, continued around the turn in the three and four path and faded in the lane. PINO IN A PURSE raced off the pace between horses through the opening
quarter of a mile, came around the turn in the two and three path and made no bid. PURE ELEGANCE raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the
opening stages, navigated the turn from the four and five path, swung wider still into the stretch and was empty from there. LUCKY LIZZIE trailed the field
on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and was not a factor.
