Footnotes
SMART SKY took command leaving the chute, put all outside speed challengers away through the turn to open up on the pack turning for home and drew
away easily through the stretch to win unchallenged down the lane. ARAMOS settled in midfield just off the fence down the backside, was roused midpoint
on the turn, rallied with a quarter left angling out to the three path for the stretch drive, could not threaten the long gone frontrunning winner but ran on the
be a clear second. UNXPECTED TIGER travelling in the middle of the pack saving ground early on, took closer order to the leaders with three eighths
remaining, had to tap on the brakes momentarily inside at the five sixteenths marker, angled out for clear run in the four path at the top of the lane and
offered a good finish to be alone in the third spot at the wire. RARE DISCOVERY broke out at the start, was void of any early speed and trailed down the
backside, began to gain momentum four wide outside rivals two furlongs from the prize and passed tired horses racing to the finish. UGOTAFRIENDINME
tracked just off the dueling trio four wide at the half, engaged three wide outside at the three eighths marker, faded with two furlongs left to run and faltered
inside at the furlong marker. HEY LUIGI forced the issue two wide between runners into the turn, then was urged to keep up with five sixteenths to go and
retreated in upper stretch. MANETKA pressed between rivals two wide at the half, gave way with runners on either side at the three furlong pole and was
empty for the stretch drive.

Footnotes
SWATH moved forward inside to take the lead nearing the five-eighths pole and was soon clear, faced some outside pressure into and on the turn, moved
clear yet again, held sway while being kept to the task. ALL TIME CLASSIC was a touch fractious in the gate then broke very awkwardly, bobbling a bit, and
spotting the field about eight lengths, trailed up the backstretch, advanced inside foes on the turn, came out for room in upper stretch, had aim on the leader
but could make no headway late. ANSELMO raced up close between runners four to five wide on the turn and encouraged along past the three-eighths,
shifted in at the top of the stretch, kept on late to get up for show honors. ALPHA BETA GAMA was prominent early, steadily dropped back into and on the
turn three to four wide, swung eight wide into upper stretch and came again but just failed to get third. THE COACHMAN was on the lead early then ceded
that to the eventual winner content to press three deep, came out five to six wide by upper stretch and weakened. WHY NOT BOURBON was a bit reluctant
to load, moved closer outside five to six wide on the turn, lacked the needed late kick. MIDNIGHT SAINT raced off the inside in the four to six path through
the turn and failed to menace. SCARBOROUGH BLUFFS raced inside off the pace and was not a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY INTO THE
START NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.

GRACEFUL FIGHTER was squeezed at the break, settled near the back into the first turn four abreast, began to rally three wide outside rivals at the three
eighths pole, shifted out in the five path for the drive and wore down the game frontrunner nearing the wire for the victory. BLASITO dictated the pace up
front in the early stages inside, relinquished the top spot at the quarter pole racing on the rail, resurged in mid stretch to take control and stubbornly battled
with the closing winner on his outside to the wire just missing in a gutsy effort. KEYSER had a good tracking position inside watching the contesting leaders
throughout, waited on the far turn to offer a rally, was urged for more run two furlongs from the wire, could not quicken in upper stretch with the leaders and
was not a threat to the top two while holding safe for the show award. RIVER OF BABYLON was steadied momentarily on the rail into the first turn, settled
inside near the back with a half left to run, was shuffled on the rail to trail three furlongs from home, regrouped outside at the quarter marker, closed outside
in the six path turning for home and ran on for a minor role at the finish line. BOSTON BAY was brushed on the break, tracked in the two path in the second
flight down the backstretch, contended four wide at the top of the lane, was steadied briefly between rivals nearing the eighth pole and was one paced
afterwards to the finish. SEATTLE POINT broke out at the start, pressed the leader at the half mile marker, took command outside at the quarter pole, gave
way between rivals to lose the lead with a furlong left to run and faltered in deep stretch. PREETZAH'S STAR settled at the rear between rivals down the
backstretch, was asked to go on inside at the three furlong marker, offered little effort and was not factor in the stretch stretch. RIDERS CLAIM OF FOUL #7
BOSTON BAY ON #6 GRACEFUL FIGHTER NEARING THE EIGHTH POLE RESULTED IN NO CHANGE

Footnotes
SIR SEAMUS moved clear to set the pace near the inside, was given moderate urging in upper- to mid-stretch and held safe. THE GREAT OZ settled off
the pace, went about three wide into the turn, angled eight wide turning for home, was gaining but too late. CITRUS BOY stalked outside the eventual
winner going three to four wide on the turn, ran on evenly. PERFECT CRIME settled into stride in the back half of the field, advanced inside foes late on the
turn, angled six wide into upper stretch and ran on. U S ARMY CORPS settled toward the rear racing off the inside, went about in the three to four path
through the turn and into upper stretch, ran on with mild late interest. LENNY K unhurriedly brought up the rear racing near the inside, kicked on mildly. MY
SILENCER pursued from outside the second flight, went four to five wide on the turn, came out seven wide in upper stretch and weakened. SALVATOR
MUNDI chased the eventual winner, dropped back two to three wide on the turn, was in a bit tight coming out of that bend and racing wider, continued to
weaken.

Footnotes
AWESOME TREAT broke sharp from the outside to clear to the rail while in hand with five eighths from the line, continued to set the pace unchallenged
through the turn, was roused turning for home and drew away nicely in mid stretch to hold safe in the end. LADY BREW tracked on the rail into the turn, was
nudged to go after the frontrunning winner at the quarter pole, had a chance for the top prize turning for home, could not reel in the loose leader in upper
stretch but stubbornly battled on holding the place share in the end. SPIDER BELLE trailed the field in the beginning, began to lengthen her stride at the
three eighths marker, advanced smartly on the fence two furlongs from the finish and battled inside down the stretch just missing out on the place award at
the finish. MAGIC RIDE travelled near the back in the beginning, was coaxed four wide with three furlongs remaining to begin picking up rivals outside on
the turn, angled out to the five path for the stretch drive and had late energy to close in for a small share. CURLIN CANDY tracked the leader in the two path
down the backside, was roused midpoint on the turn to contend four wide at the top of the stretch and stalled at the furlong marker. BAYOU BELLE bobbled
at the start, settled in midfield in the two path down the backside, trailed the field on the turn and passed tiring competitors down the stretch. TWISTER
ALERT settled in the middle of the pack on the fence at the half, was ridden for more with runners on either side at the quarter pole and could not get
interested running down the stretch. RETAIL THERAPIST tracked three wide at the half mile pole, chased three wide midpoint on the turn, gave way four
wide two furlongs from the finish and made no impact down the lane.

Footnotes
MR SPEED came in a bit at the start, tracked from inside, moved out a couple paths turning for home, took over past the furlong marker, went clear, drifted
out late and held. STANLEY HOUSE was in a bit tight just after the start, settled off the pace switching out, entered the turn about four wide, fanned eight
wide to be widest at the top of the stretch, was gaining but too late. ALPHA MEISTER raced off the pace and just off the inside, came out late while rallying
through traffic in a good late effort. TOWN'S WARRIOR bumped with a foe at the start, was about mid-division near the inside, angled six wide turning for
home, was best of the rest. YORKVILLE prompted the early pace from outside, went two to three wide on the turn, weakened some. MIDNIGHT
MOONSHINE was in a bit tight at the start, went four to five wide on the turn, moved seven wide into upper stretch, ran on mildly. MESA SPIRIT raced up
close three to four wide, came up empty. ERNIE'S MARTINI bumped with a rival at the start, raced toward the back and inside, came out in the stretch, was
never near enough to threaten. KINETIC STONE moved forward inside to force the pace, came up empty. CRUMLIN LAD pursued three to four wide and
up close early, steadily retreated.

seven path at the top of the lane and wore down the loose pacesetter at the wire to share the victory after a mile and a half. ENGLISH CONQUEROR was
situated on the fence in midfield four furlongs from the prize, had to wait on the rail entering the final turn, angled out at the quarter marker to be six wide for
the drive to the line and determinedly with runners on either side battled in deep stretch just miss out on the top two placings in the end. NOVO SOL (BRZ)
travelled well in hand in the middle of the field rating comfortably down the backstretch for the final time, advanced nicely up the rail with a quarter mile to
the finish to be in the mix at the top of the stretch, battled on between foes at the furlong marker but needed more late to threaten the top spots in deep

wide turning for home to be in with a chance for a small share and stalled between foes in mid stretch. SEVENTYSEVEN STONE stalked close to the back
of the field in the early parts of this race, put in a mild run between rivals with a half mile left to go and could not get interested behind horses in upper
stretch to be involved late. PRIDEOFDISTINCTION was situated near the back in the early stages, stalked three wide on the second turn, took closer order
four wide with a half remaining, angled out seven wide at the top of the lane and was one paced to the wire. ELUSIVE KNIGHT was unhurried trailing the
field the first time around, continued to lag at the back of the pack down the backside for the final time, and showed some late interest to pass tiring
challengers running to the finish line. MEGAYACHT settled in mid pack in the two path after a mile, was ridden with runners on either side three furlongs
from the finish, angled out to the five path for the stretch run and could not make a late charge running to the wire. ANGELOU broke out at the start, tracked
just behind the leader for the first mile, was urged to go after the frontrunner at the quarter pole, had little response and retreated through the field down the
stretch. YA BEAUTY (GB) settled near the back of the pack in the early stages of the race, saved ground throughout, took closer order to the field on the
final turn inside and could not make an impression down the stretch. BRITISH ROYALTY was close to the pace tracking two wide down the backside for the
final time, began to give way while under a drive with three furlongs remaining and retreated between foes at the quarter pole.

outside three to four wide, was in range turning for home but had no late kick. HENLEY'S JOY raced outside a foe two wide at the rear, came out in the
stretch then altered out further for room in mid- to late-stretch. RONDURE bumped a rival at the start, raced three to five wide mid-pack, failed to rally.

Footnotes
KIDDIE HOLIDAY broke inwards on the start, tracked with foes on either side in mid pack going into the far turn, was in tight surroundings at the quarter
pole, shifted out to the four path for clear running room at the top of the lane and when roused responded well to win convincingly to draw away at the finish.
HELL BENT tracked just off the fence racing down the backstretch, contested for the front three wide outside horses on the far turn, offered a strong bid in
the three path between rivals turning for home and stubbornly fought on the be second best in the end. FORESTERS PRINCESS took closer order to the
leaders in the second flight tracking inside at the half mile marker, was in a good spot on the rail watching the co leaders battle through the far turn, shifted
out in the two path at the top of the lane for a run and could only finish evenly behind runners to the wire. ARGENTIUM dictated the pace on the rail into the
first turn, gave way to a tracking position inside down the backstretch, engaged for the lead between foes at the three furlong pole, took command at the
quarter marker, and faded the final sixteenth to settle on the fringes. BROKEN PROPOSAL settled near the rear inside into the first turn, shifted out down
the backside three wide outside foes at the half, was ridden into the far turn for more, offered little response and was not a factor racing widest in the stretch.
SILENT LUCIDITY pressed the issue just outside into the first turn, took command into the backstretch, was headed outside with three eighths to the wire,
fought on until upper stretch and faded at the furlong marker. SUPREMEACTION trailed the field throughout and could not get involved in the stretch drive.

Footnotes
MARISA'S MISSION was forced in and steadied slightly heading into the first turn racing in the two path, continued to track in behind up close off the
leaders, moved out four wide coming to the quarter pole, struck the front at the three-sixteenths, drew clear and held well. TIMESKIP steadied when in tight
early into the first turn, saved ground inside, moved out a path on the far turn, came out further for the stretch run, was second best. DUKE OF CARTHANIA
bumped with a rival at the start, raced off the pace between runners two to three wide early, moved out at the three-eighths, was five wide coming past the
quarter pole and under urging, proved best of the rest. HALLIE'S HERO was forced in and placed in tight quarters into the first turn then took back and
altered outside the leader, stalked that one early, edged closer to apply pressure about the five- and one-half, made a mild bid at the top of the stretch but
had no extra. COMBATIVE moved clear and shifted in to set the pace, faced some pressure up the backstretch and turning for home, weakened. MOON
OVER MONTANA raced about mid-pack three to four wide throughout, ran on evenly. READY HERO moved out off the inside and advance three to six
wide on the far turn, evened out thereafter. SHANGASSAH raced at the back about three to four wide early, continued from the back three wide on the far
turn, failed to menace. MR. DAZZLE pursued from just off the leaders three wide, dropped back and faded. GLOVANNA bumped with a rival at the start,
raced on or just off the rail while toward the back, was not a factor. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY AS WELL AS AN OBJECTION BY THE RIDER
OF TIMESKIP AGAINST MARISA'S MISSION ALLEGING INTERFERENCE, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN.
