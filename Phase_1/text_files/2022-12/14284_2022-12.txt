Footnotes
BARBARA ROHLOFF was urged along the inside to gain the advantage from the outset, dictated the pace on a narrow advantage into the turn, held sway
on a clear margin past midstretch and was kept to firm right handed pressure. MISS MIA, forwardly placed three wide racing on terms with the leaders into
the turn, continued with a steady effort pursuing the winner to the end but proved only second best. CHI TOWN HEAT, urged between rivals prompting the
pacesetter through the backstretch into upper stretch, faded leaving midstretch. HAPPY QUEST was eased off the pace after the opening furlong, switched
outside a rival racing into the turn, angled to the four path in upper stretch and continued evenly to late stages. PRINCESS RULER broke awkwardly, was
settled last to upper stretch and proved no threat. PRINCESS TONI was settled out of striking distance off the inside racing to the turn and offered no rally.

Footnotes
MY LADY SLEW was keen between horses and took the lead past the five eighths opened up on her own initiative while saving ground around the turn,
opened up further in the lane under a drive midstretch and held command to the finish. BALIMOS tracked the pace three wide, swung into the six path to the
lane, proved no match for MY LADY SLEW when driven but chased on a clear second best. PRETTY IN PRADO was sharp early and led in the opening
furlong, raced at the inside of the tracking flight past the five eighths, hugged the rail around the turn, swung three wide into the lane, could not match the
leading pair down the lane but kept on willingly and held the show. AMARI S. chased near the rear of the main group four wide, continued to chase four
wide around the bend, swung into the lane in the seven path for the drive and drifted out several more paths in upper stretch, chased on mildly while
gradually angling in a few more paths and narrowly missed the show between horses. EVIE JEAN soon trailed, began to rally up the rail around the turn,
swung out to the eight path in upper stretch, kept on with interest but narrowly missed the show. SURE SHOT ANNIE chased inside early and two wide on
the turn, was driven two wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. BUMPER GIRL stumbled at the start, tracked between horses early, was pushed
along between horses on the turn well behind the leader, was driven inside in upper stretch, proved no match for MY LADY SLEW and weakened.
LALUCHADORA chased near the rear of the main group three wide, settled back in the three to four path behind the main group on the turn, swung into the
lane in the eight path and had no rally. SUCCESSFUL LADY was hard to settle between horses at the rear of the main group, was pushed along between
horses on the turn for a brief three wide bid on the turn, but emptied out under a drive in the lane.

Footnotes
HELA was urged between rivals disputing the pace from the outset through the backstretch, dueled inside a rival on the turn, shook clear racing into upper
stretch and was kept to energetic handling to widen the advantage late. DEMAND RANSOM broke sharply, was eased off the leaders in the opening
furlong, was prompted to advance outside a rival on the turn, shifted three wide racing into upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for the
place honors late. DUST DANCER was urged three deep on the backstretch pressing the pace, dueled outside the eventual winner on the turn into upper
stretch and gave way. COMING UP ACES settled outside foes in the last flight racing to the turn, then continued evenly in the four path racing through the
stretch. MISTER CHARMING was settled off the second flight along the rail in the opening quarter, tipped off the inside racing into upper stretch but offered
no rally. SKIP AWAY CARTER settled between foes in the last flight and dropped out early. B G ATTACK flashed brief pace inside foes contesting the lead
but gave way abruptly racing into the turn.

Footnotes
USA USA USA settled at the rear, was nudged along inside of MAZLAN into the turn, got around the weakening RAIN ATTACK past the three eighths while
racing in the four path, continued to improve in tandem with MISS HIGH N MIGHTY approaching the quarter, swung out six wide into the lane, sustained a
rally, quickened sharply when driven near the sixteenth and got up in time. WILDWOOD DREAMER was restless in the gate, broke out and bumped MOM'S
KINGDOM in the opening strides, tracked the leading pair early, bid two wide on the turn, engaged her near the three eighths, vied with that foe around the
rest of the turn and into upper stretch, dispatched with that foe for good past the sixteenth but could not hold off USA USA USA late. MOM'S KINGDOM was
bumped by WILDWOOD DREAMER in the opening strides and bumped into WHITE CASHEL as a result, was sent for pace, led outside of TENSE near the
five eighths, briefly kicked clear of that foe into the turn, vied inside of WILDWOOD DREAMER from the three eighths into the lane, continued vying inside
that foe to the sixteenth and weakened late. TENSE broke sharply and was clear in the opening furlong, was headed by MOM'S KINGDOM past the five
eighths, prompted the pace inside to the half, steadied into the turn when MOM'S KINGDOM came in on her, tracked the leading pair in the three to four
path on the turn, could not reel the leading pair in under a drive in the lane, and kept on mildly. MISS HIGH N MIGHTY was rank between horses early,
chased toward the rear in the five to six path on the turn, bid in tandem with USA USA USA approaching the quarter, swung seven wide into the lane, could
not match USA USA USA from upper stretch, and ran on mildly past tiring horses. MAZLAN settled in the rear flight, raced in the three path on the turn,
swung six wide into the lane, was driven between horses, drifted in, and passed tiring horses. JEMEZ FALLS settled behind the chasing flight, was urged for
a bid in the four path on the turn and improved position though did not get in touch with the leading trio, and flattened in the lane. WHITE CASHEL was
bumped by MOM'S KINGDOM in the opening strides, chased the leading trio three wide early, settled back well behind the leading trio in the two to three
path on the turn, mustered no rally on the leading trio in upper stretch and weakened. RAIN ATTACK was pushed along early, raced at the inside of the
chasing line, weakened in the two to three path on the turn, stopped in upper stretch, slowed to a walk late but crossed the wire unassisted and walked off
the course.

Footnotes
KRAMDEN was urged inside a rival prompting the pace into the first turn, conceded the lead into the backstretch, pressed the issue nearing upper stretch,
then edged forward to go clear leaving midstretch while being kept to firm encouragement. BEHAVIN MYSELF was urged forcing the pace outside the
eventual winner on a narrow advantage into the backstretch, dueled for command outside that foe nearing upper stretch but proved only second best. WILD
FOX broke very slowly after turning his head just before the start, switched outside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch, was prompted to advance
four wide into the far turn, continued three deep in that path into upper stretch to gain terms with the leaders midstretch but lacked the needed final kick.
BAREFOOTBOOTLEGGER hopped at the start, then angled to the inside to track just off the second flight racing into the first turn, steadily advanced
nearest the rail into the second bend, saved ground to upper stretch and finished evenly through the lane. BUXTERHOOTER tracked off the first flight near
the inside to the first turn, tipped off the inside on the backstretch tracking the leaders between foes in second flight into the far turn, but faded in the drive.
GAGOOTS tracked off the second flight between foes in the opening half, switched out nearing the far turn conceding position, then continued four wide
through the stretch while making an effort to regain some position late. IRISH MAJOR settled inside foes in the last flight racing to the backstretch and failed
to mount a serious challenge. RIVER CACTUS tracked outside foes behind the second flight racing to the backstretch and steadily faded into the far turn.
WILLING TO SPEED tracked the leaders three wide in second flight to the backstretch, continued in that path to the far turn and gave way after six furlongs.
DOM CAETANO (ARG) proved no factor.

Footnotes
PAPA'S LUCKY SEVEN soon trailed, regained touch with the rest of the field past the five eighths, rallied inside foes into the turn, shifted out and continued
to improve in the three path around the far turn, swung six wide for the drive, sustained his rally, took the lead past the sixteenth pole and cleared late. HIGH
BROW tracked the leader around the clubhouse turn and down the backstretch, raced between horses from near the five eighths, bid outside the leader
near the three eighths, vied in earnest from near the quarter pole past the furlong mark, took the lead, but was caught inside the sixteenth mark and chased
on a clear second best late. FORWARD CURVE quickly cleared, continued clear on the lead down the back straight, saved ground around the far turn, was
engaged by HIGH BROW past the three eighths, disputed the pace from near the furlong mark, was driven into the lane while continuing to vie, but flattened
out past the furlong mark. SPALDING STROLL settled at the rear of the main pack, continued toward the rear down the backstretch and in the three to four
path around the far turn, came three wide into the lane, and chased on mildly past tiring horses while never threatening the top three. GATE CREW chased
between horses around the first turn, chased midpack into the backstretch, advanced to join inside the tracking flight past the five eighths, tracked the
leading pair in the two path on the far turn, came two wide into the lane and weakened. PINEDALE chased inside around the first turn while a bit hard to
settle, settled back toward the rear of the main pack into the back straight, was pushed along into the far turn, went to a drive in the three path near the three
eighths, floated into the seven path into the lane and offered no bid. AHEADOFTHEGAME broke inward, chased three wide around the first turn, ran keenly
into the backstretch, tracked three wide around the back straight and around the far turn, floated six wide into the lane and emptied out.

Footnotes
CAT ATTACK broke sharply, was urged along the inside setting the pace on a comfortable margin to the backstretch, tipped off the inside on the far turn
maintaining that margin and was kept to firm encouragement through the closing stages to remain clear to the wire. SUMMER DAY was rated between foes
just off the second flight racing to the first turn, angled to the inside entering the backstretch, was prompted to advance inside foes racing into the far turn,
shifted out three wide in upper stretch and continued willingly in that path to close the gap while prevailing for the place honors. TRAIL RIDGE ROAD
tracked the pacesetter inside rivals as part of the second flight racing to the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn to upper stretch while being prompted
to advance but lacked the needed final bid. WHITE LIES tracked the leaders three wide between foes in second flight to the backstretch, conceded some
position after a half, but continued evenly between foes into the stretch to regain some position in the closing stages. MY MORNING GAL, off last, was
reserved along the inside to the backstretch, saved ground gaining some position racing into upper stretch but lacked the needed final kick. GHAALEB THE
GREAT, caught four wide racing into the first turn while being prompted to a position in the second flight, continued in that path to upper stretch, steadily
faded nearing midstretch and was vanned off the course after the race when failing to return to be unsaddled. BEYOND PROPER settled outside a rival
dropping of the second flight racing to the backstretch and offered no rally. I LUV THIS BAR was prompted to a forward placing between rivals tracking the
pacesetter in second flight to the backstretch, was urged to close the gap on that rival after a half but gave way between foes nearing upper stretch.

Footnotes
CHRISTMAS PRESENT tracked the leading pair, inched forward into the turn to attend outside of SHANGHAI SILVER, tracked the leading pair again while
positioned three wide near the three eighths, shifted four wide into upper stretch, ran on relentlessly between horses in the final furlong, was carried out by
SHANGHAI SILVER as that one drifted out, bumped DEORA STORE late and brushed several times with that foe, and got the bob in the end between
horses. SHANGHAI SILVER was reluctant to load, prompted the pace outside of VALLEY VISTA, engaged that foe in a duel while racing two wide near the
three eighths, continued the duel through upper stretch, dispatched VALLEY VISTA past the furlong mark despite drifting out, fought on inside of
CHRISTMAS PRESENT and DEORA STORE but lost the nod at the wire. DEORA STORE was bumped by FINAL CALL in the opening strides, chased
three deep down the back straight, continued midfield in the four path on the turn outside of MR. SPRINGTIME, swung six wide into the lane, rallied well
outside horses, was bumped by CHRISTMAS PRESENT to his inside late and brushed several times with that foe, continued to battle on and just missed.
VALLEY VISTA was sent hard for pace between horses, set a pressured pace inside of SHANGHAI SILVER, dueled inside that foe from the three eighths
through upper stretch, and flattened inside past the eighth pole. ART HEIST was herded out by FAMA Y DINERO in the opening strides, chased inside of
MR. SPRINGTIME and DEORA STORE early, settled back past the nine sixteenths, raced in the five path on the turn, came seven wide into the lane and
passed tiring horses. MR. SPRINGTIME was bumped by SHANGHAI SILVER in the opening strides, chased between horses, raced rank into the turn,
chased in the three path inside of DEORA STORE, came two wide into upper stretch, chased on to midstretch and flattened. FAMA Y DINERO broke out,
tracked inside the leading pair early, settled back along the inside on the turn to midfield, chased on inside to midstretch and weakened late. FINAL CALL
broke out and bumped DEORA STORE in the opening strides, soon trailed, raced in the five path on the turn, came into the lane six wide, drifted out toward
the outside of the track despite a right-handed crop and never threatened.
