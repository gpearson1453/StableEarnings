Footnotes
BALIMOS, bumped, then squeezed between rivals at the start, settled last to the backstretch, shifted out advancing to contention four wide through the far
turn to upper stretch and produced a steady late response to wrest a narrow advantage in time under firm encouragement. PRETTY IN PRADO was urged
to the lead along the inside dictating the pace on a narrow advantage, continued gamely holding sway through the far turn past midstretch but couldn't
contain the winner. MIZZEN MILLIONS broke outwards bumping the eventual winner, was righted, then urged between foes prompting the pacesetter to the
far turn, then to upper stretch but weakened late. TANGO CITY gained a position tracking just off the leaders along the inside to the far turn, shifted out
three wide nearing upper stretch to lodge a brief bid in that path entering the lane but flattened out late. EVIE JEAN was reserved off the second flight racing
to the far turn, tipped out three wide racing into the lane and continued with an even effort. KENKEAD tracked the leaders along the inside to the backstretch
but retreated early. SURE SHOT ANNIE was urged in brief pursuit of the leaders four wide through the first turn, then three deep on the backstretch and
emptied out racing through the far turn. WHITE CASHEL exchanged bumps with the eventual winner at the start, was righted to briefly contest the pace
between foes racing to the backstretch but was spent early.

Footnotes
FLYING BUSINESS was hustled clear along the inside soon after the break, held sway on a comfortable margin into the turn, then past midstretch and was
kept to some right handed encouragement. TIME BREAK tracked the pacesetter between foes in second flight racing into the bend, continued with a steady
effort into the stretch and proved best of the others while never menacing the winner. SILVERA tracked the pacesetter four deep as part of the second flight
in the opening stages and continued evenly in that path into the lane. LA GUERRERITA was settled off the second flight raced five wide on the backstretch,
angled inwards to race between foes through the stretch but had no rally. SUMMER LOVIN, off a step slowly, settled along the inside in the opening quarter,
swung outside foes on the turn gathering momentum and made some belated progress five wide in the closing stages. IRISH HALO settled between foes in
the opening stages, saved ground through the turn but never proved a serious threat. HOPPESTRY tracked the pacesetter between foes, then along the
inside as part of the second flight racing into the bend and steadily faded nearing the lane.

Footnotes
FRISCO LINE tracked the pacesetter from just out of striking position racing a bit off the inside into the turn, advanced to wrest the advantage despite the
pacesetter shifting into his path and went clear late under firm encouragement. PO BOY was urged clear of the field outside foes in the opening furlong,
angled to the inside nearing the turn holding sway on a clear margin, set the pace to upper stretch, drifted out into the winner's path midstretch and proved
no match for that foe late while proving best of the others. DEORA STORE settled between foes in the opening stages, was prompted to advance racing
into the bend, steadily gained position three deep racing through the turn, was carried out avoiding FAMA Y DINERO nearing midstretch but continued with
interest to edge a rival for a share on the wire. SHANGHAI SILVER, reluctant to load, tracked the pacesetter outside the eventual winner through the
backstretch into the turn, advanced in tandem with that rival three deep into upper stretch but flattened out late. BETTER THINK TWICE settled outside foes
in the last flight on the backstretch, angled to the inside racing into upper stretch but offered no rally. FAMA Y DINERO was urged to gain a position along
the inside tracking just off the second flight racing into the bend, drifted out in upper stretch momentarily impeding a rival and quickly emptied out. KNIEVEL
was caught in tight quarters at the start while getting away a step slowly, saved ground to upper stretch but offered no rally.

Footnotes
SASSY KATIE was urged along the inside contesting the pace inside foes into the first turn, lost the advantage midway through the backstretch, kept on
with a steady effort disputing the issue inside foes through the far turn to upper stretch, then shook clear through the closing stages to prove best under
energetic encouragement. LORRAINE'S LEGACY, in touch with the first flight between foes racing into the first turn, was eased just off the leaders to track
those rivals between foes on the backstretch, shifted out three deep racing into the far turn to press the issue in that path into upper stretch but proved no
match for the winner late. LIL CARRIE D, off a step slowly, tracked off the first flight outside a rival in the three path to the backstretch, shifted four wide
entering upper stretch and continued with interest to edge a rival for a share. J Z'S FINE WINE angled inwards tracking off the first flight racing to the far
turn but had no closing bid. VOSTRA stumbled at the start, settled outside foes racing to the backstretch, continued widest into the far turn and soon gave
way. TAVERN, restless in the gate prior to the start, reared at the break losing position to the field and never regained contention. CANDY LOOKER was
urged three deep into the first turn forcing the pace outside rivals to gain the advantage midway through the backstretch, dueled between foes through the
far turn and gave out abruptly in upper stretch.

Footnotes
COAL TOWN ROAD, forwardly placed stalking a rival's pace through the backstretch, advanced to wrest the advantage racing into the bend, held sway on
a clear margin through the turn, dug in while shifting to the inside when challenged in upper stretch and gamely held the bid of SMOOTH ATTACK to the
end under firm encouragement. The latter, forwardly placed three deep racing through the backstretch, made a steady advance in that path to challenge the
winner in upper stretch, continued willingly to contest the issue to the end but was just outkicked. WICKED SUPRISE sprinted to the lead along the inside
through the backstretch, dueled for command inside the eventual winner into the turn, couldn't maintain terms with the top pair racing into upper stretch but
lasted for a share. ANUNKA tracked off the first flight inside a rival in the opening stages, switched off the inside to race in the three path through the turn to
upper stretch but had no closing bid. UNCLE DICK settled well off the leaders along the inside racing to the turn, shifted out in upper stretch and gained
some position between foes late. ELECTRIC CHARGE, off slowly, settled into stride inside rivals racing into the bend, then tipped out in upper stretch to
pass between some tiring rivals while never proving a real threat. PERFUMER, off a step slowly, raced outside foes to the turn and never gained contention.
TRYGVE tracked the leaders outside a rival as part of the secondf flight in the opening quarter, angled inside racing into the turn but steadily faded late.

Footnotes
SHI O'SHI was urged between foes to wrest the advantage after the opening sixteenth, dictated the pace racing well off the inside into the turn, shifted to
the three path racing through the stretch but maintained a safe margin under right handed pressure. KITTEN ROCKS came through close quarters at the
start, was urged to a forward placing between rivals tracking just outside the pacesetter racing into the turn, couldn't gain terms with the winner but held a
rival for the place honors. ALMAFUERTE broke sharply, tracked the pacesetter four wide as part of the second flight racing into the turn, continued in that
path through the stretch while being roused to close the gap but was just outkicked for a second. FANCY EMPRESS, a bit slow into stride, settled last on
the backstretch, saved ground on the bend, then came around a rival racing into upper stretch to gain some position in the closing stages. ARCH FLYER
broke inwards into the path of KITTEN ROCKS, was reserved between foes off the second flight racing three deep between foes into the lane but offered no
closing bid. APRIL'S GEM was urged along the inside pursuing the pacesetter through the backstretch into the turn and steadily faded into upper stretch.
HER GOLD MINE tracked off the second flight racing five wide into the turn and steadily retreated into upper stretch.

Footnotes
PINBALLER, reluctant to load, broke readily, was urged along the inside to contest the pace in the opening stages, tipped outside the leader nearing the half
mile marker, continued to make a steady gain nearing upper stretch to challenge for command nearing the furlong marker and wrested a narrow advantage
in time under stout pressure in a prolonged drive. K C'S FIRST B M W was urged away to a clear advantage from between foes in the opening stages,
angled to the inside dictating the pace on a clear margin into the turn, grudgingly dueled for command inside the winner past midstretch but couldn't contain
that foe while prevailing for the place honors. C F V RED NOVA tracked the leaders four wide through the backstretch, made a steady advance to striking
distance three deep nearing upper stretch and continued willingly in that path to close the gap while prevailing for a share. KEEP ATTACKING was rated
between foes through the backstretch, switched outside foes on the turn while being prompted to advance, was fanned five wide into upper stretch and
continued with interest to close the gap on the leaders to the end. JOHNNY UP settled last racing to the turn, switched outside rivals on the bend, was
fanned six wide nearing upper stretch, then shifted inside rivals to gain some position between foes in the closing stages. HURTS SO BAD tracked off the
leaders three deep between foes in the opening stages, angled to the inside racing through the turn, then shifted out four wide in upper stretch and steadily
faded leaving the furlong marker. KANITHAPPEN made brief pursuit of the leaders inside foes on the backstretch and steadily faded racing into the turn.

Footnotes
GAGOOTS was reserved outside a rival dropping well off the leaders racing to the first turn, steadily gathered momentum to advance between foes into the
second bend, was held up momentarily avoiding tight quarters, then altered course to advance on the leaders five wide nearing upper stretch, circled foes to
wrest the advantage in upper stretch and went clear under firm encouragement. NOT VERY GENTLE was rated well off the leaders along the inside to the
backstretch, saved ground racing into the far turn gaining position, tipped out to split foes three wide and continued with a steady effort to prevail for the
place honors late. BEHAVIN MYSELF was urged between foes forcing the pace into the first turn, then outside a rival gaining a narrow advantage racing
into the far turn, couldn't contain the winner in upper stretch but continued with a grudging effort to contest second to late stages. IRISH MAJOR settled last
racing to the backstretch, switched outside foes gathering momentum on the far turn, was fanned six wide into upper stretch to gain some position late but
made no real impression on the leaders. HATCHET CREEK was urged to the lead along the inside racing into the first turn dictating the pace on a narrow
advantage, dueled for command inside a rival through the backstretch to upper stretch and gave way in late stages. DELFT BLUE, urged to terms with the
first flight three wide between foes into the backstretch, was eased off the pace after the opening quarter while shifting to the inside nearing the second
bend, switched out on the far turn to lodge a brief bid three deep between foes but came up empty in upper stretch. WILLOW RIDGE was urged to terms
with the leaders four wide racing into the first turn, dropped back from that position entering the backstretch, was prompted to lodge a brief advance while
caught four wide leaving the midway point of the far turn and emptied out into upper stretch.
