POSITIVE POWER tracked on the inside, then two wide, angled out midway on the far turn, rallied outside of BABY GUNDIN turning for home, gradually
wore down that rival and edged away late. BABY GUNDIN stalked the pace, bid two wide on the far turn, took over soon after, led into the stretch, dug in
gamely in the stretch drive and then yielded. TIZ A SHARPIE raced two wide off the pace, advanced inside on the far turn, angled out, rallied mildly and
earned the show spot. JUST STAY HOME raced off the pace, advanced between rivals on the far turn and closed mildly outside. WORLD PARTY raced off
the pace inside, angled out and passed tired rivals. ONE WILD WOMAN raced four wide early, then vied two wide for the lead, dueled inside on the far turn
and faded. SUGAR STREAK vied inside for the lead, then chased and gave way. WONDER CITY raced five wide early, then stalked two wide, chased and
faded. LULA'S ROADRUNNER raced three or four wide off the pace and gave way.

ONE MORE SCOOP broke slowest, rushed to contention, angled three wide on the turn, bid to the front in the stretch and edged away. WIZKY'S ON THE
BAY lacked speed, raced wide throughout and closed well for the place. BLACK LIGHT vied outside, shook off a challenge at the quarter pole and
continued gamely. PERFECT SILENT CAT dropped back early, moved inside on the turn then flattened out late. GREMLIN alternated for the advantage
along the rail and was finished after half a mile. WISPERING SPRINGS raced wide within striking range then gave way. JUST JEREMY flashed speed
between rivals then stopped abruptly.

Footnotes
HALLIGIRL dueled three wide for the lead, shook free on the turn, kicked clear in upper stretch, then dug in gamely inside and held on late. SWEETER was
off slowly, outrun early, advanced on the turn, steadied while lacking room at the quarter pole, rallied on the rail, angled out past midstretch and closed well
late in the two path. SCARF raced off the pace between rivals, advanced on the turn, came five wide into the lane, rallied outside, closed late and was
outkicked for second. CICI UNIFIED a bit reluctant to load, then fractious in the gate, dueled inside for the lead, dueled on the turn and tired. SO SWELL
raced off the pace inside, angled out at the top of the lane and closed mildly. BOHEMIA BABE dueled between rivals for the early lead, dueled on the turn
and faded. THEFABULOUS MOOLAH stalked close up outside, chased four wide on the turn and faded. MISBEHAVING LADY the gate did not open with
the rest of the field, then she hit the gate when it opened, raced three wide off the pace and did not factor. LA ALTENITA tracked the dueling leaders, moved
up three wide on the turn, then gave way. After a Stewards' Inquiry into the start, MISBEHAVING LADY was declared a non-starter due to the gate
malfunction.

Footnotes
SCOOP DAWG settled off the pace, swung wide and split foes rallying into the stretch then drew away under mild coaxing. SALTIN' THE RIM fanned very
wide into the first turn, remained wide and finished willingly. HORNBEAM far behind early, angled inside rivals late narrowing the gap while no threat.
TOUGH WORKOUT stalked the loose pacesetter, took over on the final turn then weakened. WHATA GUY angled inside early, moved to contention on the
final turn then faded. TRUE DAKOTAN dropped far behind then passed rivals without menacing. OUTWORKNFORAKISS saved ground in traffic down the
backstretch and was outrun. SINGINTHRUTHESTORM dropped back outside and lacked a rally. TWO COLOR MAP hustled to a clear advantage for half a
mile then gave way. PELLEGRINI chased in midpack early and weakened steadily. CURLIN LANE was urged from the outset inside but stopped abruptly.
VICTORY IS OURS raced within striking range briefly then stopped.

ridden out and geared down the final yards. RUNNINGFORHOME raced three wide early, stalked close up three wide, chased the winner on the far turn,
lacked a bid and remained clear for place honors. FEARLESS FLY tracked on the inside, advanced on the far turn, rode the rail into the stretch and finished
evenly. MY MAN ELVIS raced off the pace, off the inside, was asked on the far turn and failed to respond. WILD UNION stalked close up two wide, then
chased two wide and faded. LEGAL GUMP raced off the pace and was outrun.

COACH, battled heads apart outside of that rival through a long stretch drive and gamely prevailed late. PRACTICAL COACH vied between rivals for the
lead, took over nearing the far turn, dueled inside on the turn, dug in gamely inside of MR. DODA in the stretch run, battled heads apart with that rival and
yielded grudgingly late. ABSENTEE stumbled after the start, raced two wide off the pace, advanced four wide on the far turn and rallied mildly outside. THE
KING CHEEK vied three wide for the lead, chased on the far turn and weakened. GIGGING raced off the rail, off the pace, went three wide on the far turn
and lacked a rally. COBBLE ROAD was off a bit slow, raced off the pace inside, saved ground on the far turn and had no rally. GOLDEN JUAN vied inside
for the lead, chased inside on the far turn and faded. KODAPENDENT dropped back early on and was outrun.

SPLICETHEMAINBRACE settled outside, bid three wide on the turn and was up in a stretch-long battle following a long drive. MEMORY BOUQUET
pursued the loose pacesetter, was collared by the winner at the top of the stretch and, battled gamely to the wire. MR. HUSTLE lacked speed, rallied wide
and finished with good energy. FINAL SHOT chased close up inside then came up empty in the stretch. SPIKEZONE hustled to the lead inside, led to the
top of the stretch and weakened. REDEEM EDDIE dropped back along the inside and was never in contention. ALPHA CHI RHO broke sluggishly and
trailed far behind throughout.

Footnotes
WILLY MC stalked the pace four wide, bid to the front at the three eighths pole and pulled away under moderate urging. THE METHOD saved ground
throughout and continued well to earn the place. WE BE THERE settled off the leaders, moved wide throughout and was up for the show. MR. EINSTEIN
broke slowest, moved to contention before the half then moved wide in the lane. KITH set pressured pace inside and began tiring on the final turn. LOAD
UP MOE lagged far behind then offered some late energy. GUSHING OIL prompted the pace outside and was finished into the far turn. TWO PRINCES
dropped far behind and was never in contention. SHOWING OFF pressed the pace three wide and gave way in the stretch. ORBERT dropped back early
and was always outrun.
