Footnotes
BORN HAPPY had a good tracking position in the second flight watching the three frontrunners do battle into the turn, waited behind the dueling leaders five
sixteenths from the finish, found a seam in the five path at the top of the lane and wore down his rivals in deep stretch for the victory. FORITTABLE took
command after the start, continued up front while pressed outside down the backstretch, surrendered the lead five sixteenths from the finish, stubbornly
re-rallied at the eighth pole and finished well to comeback and capture second money. MIA AND ME tracked on the rail behind the contesting threesome
into the turn, advanced inside three eighths from the line, had to tap on the brakes briefly midway on the turn, rallied up the fence in upper stretch and
closed late to get up for the show award. RED ZEPPELIN was in the middle of the pace battle down the backside, poked his head in front racing midway on
the turn, was collared by rivals on either side with a sixteenth remaining and faded in deep stretch losing the show award. DOMINANT DESTROYER trailed
the field at the half mile marker, raced off the fence at the rear throughout the turn, was behind runners looking for room at the top of the stretch and had
clear run down the lane but could not offer a finish. ONLY LOVE broke outwards at the start, stalked five deep down the backside, advanced four wide
outside foes on the turn, loomed in the six path turning for home and stalled outside at the furlong marker. QUICK RELOAD broke slow at the start,
recovered to engage for the lead three deep at the half, began to give way four wide midpoint on the turn and retreated in upper stretch.

Footnotes
BET settled three wide early in the back half of the field, moved out a bit and advanced four wide up the backstretch into the far turn applying more pressure
three furlongs out, took command outside the three-sixteenths, was clear by mid-stretch, held sway. COLEYVILLE was in a bit tight after the break, settled
into stride at the back racing near inside, moved out on the first turn and was widest up the backstretch six deep, exchanged a bump and steadied slightly
near the nine-sixteenths, fanned eight wide into the stretch under a drive, kept on slowly gaining to get up for place over CORRELATE, who settled just off
the leaders three wide, was mid-pack up the backstretch, continued three to four wide on the far turn coming five deep into upper stretch, kept on well but
was outfinished for second. D'S BEN was coaxed clear and shifted in to the two path to dictate terms, was pressured into the far turn, kept on till late in the
stretch and yielded grudgingly. FIRST SPRING was taken back and shifted in early racing near the rail, moved out going three wide on the far turn, came
into upper stretch five to six deep and ran on. JUNGLE FIGHTER broke outwardly just a bit, shifted in and raced on or just off the rail through the first turn
about mid-pack, lost some ground two then three wide heading into upper stretch, failed to rally. FIFTH SEASON tracked from inside, moved a bit closer
along the rail nearing the quarter pole to be within striking distance, faltered and faded. ENGLISH CLASSIC was caught four wide on the first turn, bumped
with a rival near the nine-sixteenths while advancing five wide, asked for more midway on the far turn while reaching near striking distance, came out a bit
further for the drive and flattened out. BLOCKBUSTER switched out and stalked the leader up close three wide, dropped back and faded.

SOCIETY JOE was steadied on the rail entering the first turn, tracked the engaging leaders down the backside, waited behind the dueling frontrunners on
the far turn, shifted out for a run at the five sixteenths marker, bid four wide at the top of the lane and got up right at the wire to win the photo. JEGOS FIRE
was situated near the rear well in hand in the beginning parts of the race, advanced comfortably inside picking up runners with a half left to run, rallied up
the fence turning for home finding his best stride late only to lose a close photo to his stablemate at the finish line. GIANT CRITIC tracked two wide into the
first turn, took closer to the pacesetter at the half, pressed for the lead outside midpoint on the far turn, determinedly fought on between runners dueling for
the top spot in upper stretch but needed more late to threaten for the win in the end. DR. SHANE took command from the start, dictated the pace down the
backside, was pressed outside with three eighths remaining, battled between foes in upper stretch and gave way late just holding on for a small share. I'M
DASHING trailed the field at the half mile marker, began to gain momentum three wide three furlongs from the finish, angled out from behind runners five
wide at the furlong pole and was closing in but ran out of room at the wire. MAXIMUS MOMENTUS settled in midfield all alone watching the contesting
leaders down the backstretch, was roused to go after the pacesetters with three eighths remaining, offered little response and was empty for the stretch
drive. SELF INFLICTED travelled near the back of the pack in the early stages, was asked for more run between rivals on the far turn, could not get involved
with a quarter left to go and made no impact through the stretch.

Footnotes
SPRING MOUNTAIN was bumped lightly in the run to the first turn, took the lead after the opening furlong, moved clear and shifted in on that bend while
setting the pace, was briefly pressured midway up the backstretch but quickly moved clear again, widened into upper stretch while drifting out a bit, was kept
to the task. PINK GELATO was in just a hair tight and brushed lightly at the start, settled off the pace two to three wide early, bided time on the far turn three
then four wide, swung six deep into stretch now under a drive, was second best. COLLABORATIVE tucked in to track the pacesetter on the first turn, was in
second heading for home chasing the eventual winner, evened out. KILLARY brushed lightly with rivals at the start, settled at the back near but off the inside
early, still raced well back two to three wide on the far turn, angled seven wide into the stretch and ran on mildly late. STRONGER TOGETHER eased back
and shifted inside a foe early going four wide on the first turn mid-pack just off the leader, continued four wide on the far turn floating eight wide into upper
stretch, failed to rally. TREBUCHET was lightly brushed at the start, settled at the back while switching out, raced three wide into the far turn, fanned nine
deep for the drive, made no bid. MOMENT OF PEACE moved out five wide into the first turn then back in a bit in pursuit of the leader, took closer order up
the backstretch briefly ranging up alongside the leader near the five-eighths, began to drop back three to four wide on the far turn and came up empty.
ROBITAILLE bumped with a rival and was a bit rank in the early going, moved in to track in behind two to three wide, had no late bid. SNOOKERED broke
in a bit, saved ground, was never a threat.

Footnotes
I'M EXCEPTIONAL broke in at the start, was eager under a hold to lead them into the first turn, opened up on the field through the backside, repelled an
early bid outside midway on the final turn and drew away in mid stretch to win going way comfortably at the wire. INTRO settled near the rear behind foes
down the backstretch, offered an early move angling out four wide outside of runners to rally around horses into the far turn, threatened the loose
frontrunner with five sixteenths to go, could not match strides with that winner at the top of the stretch and ran on well to best the rest at the finish.
CEE'NCEESGREYTNESS travelled in the middle of the pack three deep at the half mile marker, rallied three wide between foes into the far turn, could not
gain on the frontrunning winner at the quarter pole and raced evenly in the stretch to settle for a clear third. SET SAIL CARLIN chased the pacesetter five
wide entering the first turn, was roused seven sixteenths from home to keep pace with rallying challengers, could not respond and was shuffled back to trail
at the quarter marker, angled out widest at the top of the lane and rebid to get up late for a minor share. HARD ROCK WARRIOR was allowed to settle
trailing in the early stages, began to pick up horses three wide midpoint on the far turn, angled out to the four path for the stretch drive to contend for a minor
placing and stalled in the final sixteenth. DREAMINGOF JEANNIE tracked on the rail in hand into the first turn, advanced inside with a half from the finish,
lost ground on the fence through the far turn and was not a factor in the stretch run. LEMON DROP FOX tracked between rivals in mid pack at the half mile
pole, put in a mild run three wide outside foes with three eighths remaining and faltered in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SILENT MIRACLE moved forward between runners three wide into the turn, moved out five wide by the latter part of that bend, came into upper stretch six
wide, bid nearing the sixteenth pole and edged past. MACLIN bumped a rival lightly at the start, stalked up close three to four wide, bid at the top of the
stretch taking a narrow lead, was outfinished for the top prize but second best. HUNGRY WOLF moved forward inside to take the lead in the early going, set
the pace, was challenged turning for home, yielded only grudgingly. LITTLE DOMI chased from inside, angled five wide past the quarter pole, got the nod
for the super over. STREET SERENADE , who was off the early pace, saved ground through the turn, improved position. HEMLO GOLD broke awkwardly
and was taken up and back at the rear early, rallied inside. SO CALLED VACATION bumped with outside then inside rivals lightly at the start, chased briefly
from outside, dropped back heading to the turn, went five then six wide on that bend, ran on evenly in the stretch. JIM'S HOPE was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace and wide, came out seven deep in upper stretch, ran on. STEPHEN B GOOD bumped lightly at the start, advanced four wide between
runners chasing four then five wide on the turn and not too far off the leader, flattened out in the drive. BARWICK pressed the pace two to three wide, came
up empty. QUIET VISTA bumped a rival at the start, failed to make a bid.

Footnotes
REPEAT THE HEAT tracked inside entering the backstretch, shifted out to be three wide at the half mile pole, rallied three wide with five sixteenths to the
wire, took control outside two furlongs from the line and drew off when roused at the furlong marker. MUSKOKA GIANT advanced smartly up the fence
commencing at the three furlong marker, slipped inside at the quarter pole to contend turning for home, shifted just outside off a tiring runner with an eighth
to go and finished up well to collect the place award at the wire. SHAMATEUR had a good tracking position outside watching the engaging leaders at the
half, could not quicken enough racing four wide with the rallying winner midpoint on the far turn, chased in vain in upper stretch and lost out in the battle for
place. PEMBERLEY was situated close to the back running inside with a half remaining, began to gain on rivals on the rail through the final turn, shifted out
to the five path for the stretch drive and showed some late energy to pass tiring challengers getting up for a minor share in the end. GIANT ONE dictated the
pace down the backside, was collared outside by the winner at the quarter marker, offered little resistance and weakened inside down the lane. ICE ROAD
settled three wide near the back in the beginning, took a little closer order to the leaders down the backside stalking mid pack, was asked with three eighths
remaining and could not reach contention in the late stages of the race. LESLIE CHOW hesitated at the start to trail the field in the early stages, was on hold
three wide with three furlongs left to run, roused for more run midpoint on the far turn, offered little response and could not be a factor in the stretch drive.
DISSECTOLOGIST chased four wide on the first turn, pressed the pacesetter on the outside down the backstretch, was urged between rivals to keep up
midway on the final turn, gave way at the quarter pole and retreated in deep stretch. MIDNIGHT ARKLE travelled four wide in midfield into the first turn, was
unhurried between foes to be near the back at the half, shifted in the the fence on the final turn and could not get interested inside down the lane.

Footnotes
MALIBU SECRET settled into stride willingly positioned just off the leaders stalking, went four wide on the turn, came out five wide turning for home, struck
the lead past the three-sixteenths, moved clear and held safe. POUND GREEN lacked early speed racing off the inside, shifted seven wide coming past the
quarter pole, gained on the leader in upper- to mid-stretch but made no headway late while clearly second best. STORMY SOUL moved clear and set the
pace while shifting in, raced on or just off the rail while challenged through the turn, could not kick on with the top two but fought on to preserve show honors
from CORDUROY ROAD, who brushed lightly at the start, moved forward inside then switched outside the aforementioned, pressed that one into the turn,
contended for the lead leaving that bend, was outkicked and outfinished for third. DIXIE GIANT settled mid-pack off the leaders near but off the rail, came
out five wide turning for home, ran on. BAY OF RUM chased outside early, came into upper stretch six wide, failed to rally. DOT'S VISION exchanged some
brushes at the start, raced inside early in the back half of the field, failed to menace. MESA SKYLINE exchanged a brush at the start, raced inside a foe but
off the rail, was never a threat. MAMBOINTHEFOREST raced outside a rival at the rear, was not a factor.

Footnotes
CHAIRMAN BOB was allowed to settle near the rear down the backside, began to rally three wide midpoint on the turn, angled out for clear run in the five
path in upper stretch and was full of run to the wire to just get up in a well timed stretch finish. BIG EXECUTIVE tracked on the rail into the turn, shifted
outside for run five sixteenths from home, was coaxed for more angling out five wide at the top of the lane, took over control nearing the sixteenth pole and
was caught by the closing winner right at the wire. EXECUTIVE GIANT was off poorly to start, trailed the field while unhurried in the beginning stages of the
race, angled out six wide for the stretch drive and found his best stride late and closed well to get up for third nearing the wire. CEREBRO chased the early
pacesetter three wide, contended four wide turning for home, battled until the eighth pole and faded very late losing positions in deep stretch. I'M A CHI
TOO settled near the back on the rail in the beginning, saved ground travelling inside through the turn and passed tired runners up the fence in the stretch
run. ONE PUNCH CHARLIE stalked two wide in mid pack keeping the leaders in range on the turn, angled out five wide for the drive and had little to offer
for the run to the finish line. JIBARO was the frontrunner down the backside, continued to be up front on the turn, was collared in mid stretch and tired the
final sixteenth. HIGHLAND SOCIETY travelled in midfield in the early stages, was ridden hard for more run five sixteenths from the line and could not get
involved between runners through the stretch drive. COMMANDER TOM tracked on the rail at the half, could not keep pace with the leaders throughout the
turn and faltered between rivals at the furlong marker. BOUND LUCKY chased the the frontrunner just outside on the far turn, began to tire at the top of the
lane, stopped in mid stretch and galloped across the wire.
