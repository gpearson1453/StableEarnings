Footnotes
COMMAND A PREMIUM showed speed from the break and established the early lead, was well rated through modest fractions in the early going, came
under pressure on the second turn, repelled foes in upper stretch and drew clear to the furlong grounds, kept to task under hand urging in the final sixteenth
and drew away. DANNY MICHAEL lacked early speed, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the second turn, mounted a four
wide rally in upper stretch, could not impact the winner in the final furlong and finished well to be second best in the end. TAM'S TIME was allowed to settle,
mounted a four wide rally on the second turn, swung five wide for the drive, could not reel in the runner-up in the final stages and closed well late to get up
for third. STAY LIT was unhurried, advanced in upper stretch, was gaining in the final furlong but did not offer the needed late response. BARBARIAN
tracked the moderate early fractions, came three wide into the backstretch run, stayed within aim to the quarter marker, was outrun in upper stretch and
gave way. MADE THE TEAM settled in the second flight, advanced two wide on the far turn, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain
the effort in the drive and flattened out. ATLANTIC FROG was forwardly placed, came under a snug early hold, lost position on the second turn and tired in
the drive.

Footnotes
BOURBON GLAZE was forwardly placed in the early going, assumed command along the first turn, set moderate fractions while well handled through the
half-mile marker, was confronted by BIG GIFT nearing the quarter marker, dueled inside of that rival to mid-stretch, determinedly dug in in the final sixteenth
and was unyielding in the final strides. BIG GIFT was allowed to settle, was steered outside of rivals along the backstretch run, was roused two wide nearing
the quarter marker, confronted BOURBON GLAZE, dueled outside of that rival to deep stretch and was gamely bested in the final strides, while well clear of
the rest. DALLAS ALICE showed early speed, ceded the lead into the backstretch run, tracked the moderate pace from the inside, was outkicked in the
drive and was clear for third in the final stages. IRISH SONG LEADER stalked the early pace, raced three wide along the second turn and faded in the drive.
NIGHT CRUISER tracked the moderate early fractions, advanced nearing the second turn, lost ground on the far turn and gave way. PRAY FOR SNOW
was crowded by IRISH SONG LEADER at the start and was away a step slowly, was a bit rank into the first turn, saved ground while off of the pace to the
second turn and tired in the drive. LILY PAD LAKE was unhurried, raced three wide into the backstretch run, could not keep pace in upper stretch and was
not a factor.

Footnotes
NAUVOO showed speed and established the early lead, was well rated while setting decent fractions through the backstretch run, drew clear nearing the
quarter marker, was kept to task in mid-stretch and drew away under a hand ride in the final stages. MONEY MUNCHER settled in the second flight, shifted
out in upper stretch, gained ground nearing the furlong marker, was not able to impact NAUVOO in the final stages, found his best stride late and was up for
second in the final strides. BIG DIFFERENCE stalked the early pace, raced three wide into the backstretch run, lost ground nearing the second turn, could
not make headway on NAUVOO in the drive, was edged for second in the final strides and was well clear for third. APLOMBADO settled off of the early
pace, saved all of the ground to the second turn and finished evenly. MOONLIGHTNWINE tracked the solid early pace, lost ground to NAUVOO while
chasing that rival along the second turn, was asked for run in upper stretch and faded late. OAKDALE ROAD broke out at the start, was a bit rank in the
early stages, lacked early speed, advanced four wide on the second turn, swung five wide for the drive and did not threaten. HADLEES HONOR raced three
wide into the first turn while off of the pace, advanced approaching the second turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch
and was not a late factor.

NAUGHTY NADINE (GB) rated off of the early pace, was well placed through decent early fractions, advanced along the second turn, came in tight a bit
nearing the top of the lane, angled three wide for the drive, came within aim nearing mid-stretch, overtook WORK TO LIVE inside of the furlong marker and
kept to task in the late stages to prevail. WORK TO LIVE stalked the early pace from an inside position, advanced two wide on the second turn, assumed
command in upper stretch, could not hold off NAUGHTY NADINE inside of the furlong grounds and stayed on well in deep stretch to be second best. SHE'S
A BIT SASSY shuffled at the start and was away a bit slowly, was unhurried through the first half-mile, saved ground while trailing nearing the top of the
lane, closed well in the final furlong, did not impact the top pair in deep stretch and was well clear for third in the end. AMIKO CHOW (IRE) was allowed to
settle, raced three wide into the backstretch run, slipped to the inside along the second turn, improved position in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. THE
ARCADIAN WAY was asked to show early speed, cleared the field into the first turn and dictated early terms, came under pressure nearing the quarter
marker, was not able to keep pace in upper stretch and gave way. RUN FOR MY HONEY stalked the early pace, raced three wide from the second flight
into the backstretch run, came four wide to the second turn, lost ground in upper stretch and tired. LAST INNING was forwardly placed in the early stages,
stalked the decent fractions through the backstretch run, dropped back on the second turn, was eased through the stretch drive and walked off under her
own power. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
DASHING DEMI was unhurried, advanced along the backstretch run, came in tight and lacked room nearing the quarter marker, found room and advanced
in mid-stretch, came within aim of GOLD RUSH GAL in deep stretch and surged in the final stages to prevail. GOLD RUSH GAL stalked the early pace,
made a steady advance along the backstretch run, came within aim nearing the quarter marker, battled with LADY BLACKBIRD in upper stretch, took a
narrow lead to the final furlong, was all out to hold off DASHING DEMI in deep stretch, was caught by the winner in the final stages and was clear at the end
for second. SHAMAN'S PRODIGY settled off of the decent early fractions, advanced three wide on the second turn, swung four wide for the drive, was
outkicked in the final furlong and made a late push to secure third in the final strides. LADY BLACKBIRD showed early speed leaving the break and set a
pressured early pace, carved out decent fractions to the second turn, was confronted in upper stretch and dueled to the furlong grounds with GOLD RUSH
GAL, could not match strides in deep stretch, weakened in the final stages and was just edged for third. MISTICAL SURPRISE was forwardly placed in the
early going, raced three wide into the backstretch run, challenged the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was turned away in upper stretch and gave
way. FLIPLIT was allowed to settle, raced two wide along the second turn and lacked a late rally.

Footnotes
STRUT ON LOUIE was forwardly placed in the early going, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, determinedly held foes at
bay in deep stretch and held on in the final strides. JERRY JEFF WALKER bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, chased from the second flight,
came three wide to the quarter marker, closed fast in deep stretch, came within aim in the late stages, drifted in a bit in the final strides and just missed for
the win, while earning the nod for second. IN HONOR OF AUTISM tracked the early pace, lacked room nearing the top of the lane, shifted out in upper
stretch, dove back inside inside of the furlong marker, closed with a rush in the final stages and just missed for the win and place, while securing the show.
MISTER MIDAS stalked the early pace, gained ground three wide on the turn, battled with STRUT ON LOUIE to mid-stretch, was outfinished in the final
sixteenth and was just edged for the minor awards. EL CAPRICHO lacked early speed, trailed to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch and found
his best stride late. DOGE OF VENICE chased from the rear early on, advanced two wide on the turn, was gaining in the final furlong but was unable to
produce the needed late response. PROSPECT OF RAIN chased the early pace, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten. ZACCHEUS
showed good early speed, set a pressured pace to the turn, was confronted nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch, was eased through
the final furlong and walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
JERSEY BIRD broke alertly and showed good early speed, set a pressured pace to the quarter marker, drew clear nearing the furlong marker, held
PURPLE NIGHT at bay in deep stretch and held in a drive over the quickly oncoming runner-up. PATSY MONTANA ducked in at the break and was a bit
green in the early stages, chased from the inside on the turn, advanced in upper stretch, made a bold late rally along the rail in deep stretch, could not reel
in JERSEY BIRD and was up in the final strides for second. PURPLE NIGHT raced close to the early pace, stalked the pace three deep on the turn, lost
ground to JERSEY BIRD in upper stretch, re-rallied in the late stages, could not reel in the winner and was just edged for second in the final strides while
well clear of the rest for third. RED HARBOR was a bit slow into early stride, chased the pace four wide on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch and made a
mild late rally. TAMA SETS DA PACE hesitated at the break and was away a step slowly, chased three wide on the turn and lacked a late rally. AUTISM
EXCELLENCE was prominent early on and pressed the pace to the turn, kept close attendance to JERSEY BIRD to the quarter marker, lost ground in
upper stretch and faded in the drive. TOP HAT TIGRESS tracked the early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and
weakened. CAUSEWAY GIRL chased from the second flight in the early stages, came in tight and was shuffled back on the turn and did not produce a late
rally. FRANKLY ALL GOOD lacked early speed, trailed to the turn and was not a factor. FREED BY MAGIC tracked the pace from the second flight, came in
tight nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and gave way.

Footnotes
EAST RAND settled in the second flight in the early stages, was roused four wide on the second turn, closed determinedly in the drive, overtook UNION
DANCE in deep stretch and held in a drive over the quickly oncoming runner-up. OTTAWA FIRE (IRE) was unhurried in the early stages, raced three wide
into the backstretch run, came in tight behind tiring rivals on the second turn, shifted out in upper stretch, closed with a rush in the final furlong, just missed
for the win and was up in time to secure second. UNION DANCE rated off of the fast early fractions, advanced three wide on the far turn, reeled in the
pacesetter in mid-stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong marker, could not hold off EAST RAND in deep stretch and was outfinished for second,
while clear of the rest for third. JACKS OUTLAW showed early speed, tracked the quick pace to the half-mile marker while closest to the loose pacesetter,
came within aim in mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final sixteenth. SYNC settled in the second flight, saved ground to the second turn, lost position in
upper stretch and was not a factor. MOUNT PELLIAR was unhurried in the early stages, advanced along the backstretch run, raced two wide along the
second turn and did not threaten. DIAMOND BLITZ showed good early speed and established the early advantage, set quick fractions while on a long lead
through the backstretch run, kept to task along the second turn, was tiring in upper stretch, could not hold off oncoming rivals inside of the furlong marker
and tired late. SKY DINSKI was allowed to settle, saved ground to the second turn, came three wide to the quarter marker, swung widest for the drive and
lacked a late response.

WHOA BUDDY hustled from the rail, stalked the leading pair to the head of the stretch, swung out for room approaching the furlong grounds and responded
to strong right handed urging to get up in time. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET broke a bit behind the leading pack but steadily made up ground down the
backstretch and through the turn until he was heads up with DARKSABER passing the quarter pole, took the lead in the final sixteenth but could not hold off
the winner. DARKSABER broke quickest from the gate and went straight to the lead, was challenged turning for home by GENTLEMAN'S SECRET, battled
to deep stretch and gave way late. KNOCKOUT BERT made light contact with GENTLEMAN'S SECRET after the break, then bobbled a couple of strides
after than, recovered and raced wide down the backstretch and into the turn while advancing towards the leaders, was set down passing the three-furlong
pole, entered the stretch still wide and was in contention to deep stretch but could not make up the needed ground. BERNIE'S BIG BOY tracked the early
pace, lost ground two wide on the turn, was asked to keep pace in upper stretch but could not offer the needed response. HULA KING broke well and was in
the early mix down the backstretch, was in tight between rivals at the seven-sixteenths then steadied passing the three furlong pole, lost momentum nearing
the top of the lane, swung four wide for the drive and offered a mild late rally. EMERALD MAGIC fell behind early, moved over to the rail to save ground
approaching the turn, was impeded a bit when HULA KING steadied leaving the three-furlong marker, angled back to the rail for the stretch run and was not
a factor.
