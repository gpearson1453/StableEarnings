Footnotes
SHARP CHARLIE sprinted to a clear lead to set all the pace and drew off in the stretch. OGA BEAR vied for the lead from three wide but was no match for
the winner. SONG SPECTACULAR was placed off the pace then went four wide on the turn to make a late run to be up for the show. MIZSPELT raced near
the back, made a rail bid on the turn moved out to the two path at the sixteenth pole to improve position late. CORN SOUP settled in the middle of the pack,
made a mild bid on the turn and went four wide in upper stretch while racing evenly. HALF A BUCK was void of speed and passed tiring rivals. SUNSET
WAR was hustled along early to press the pace from the two path and tired. BIG RUSSSS was rushed up early and dropped back after three eighths.

Footnotes
FLOWER CAT was rushed up to vied for the early lead from the two path then made a rebid at the three sixteenths pole to be up in the final jumps. HEZA
SEXY ZONG sprinted to the lead from the inside then had a stretch battle and gave way grudgingly. STYLING HOOK broke in and bumped SNUFFY at the
start then settled near the back on the backstretch, went three wide on the turn to be best of the rest. VIKING LEGACY saved ground and passed tiring
rivals. BOSS MAN ZONG broke out and bumped SNUFFY at the start then was hustled along and tired. SNUFFY was fractious in the gate and void of early
speed, went four wide on the turn but had no impact. TYLER'S SENSATION broke out at the start, was forwardly place from three wide and dropped back.

from the two path to upper stretch and fought gamely to the wire. SCREENPLAY dueled for the lead for the first half from the inside then inched away to
take a clear lead but was caught in the final yards. PAYNT BATTLE was allowed to settle off the rail then went four wide at the five sixteenths pole for a late
rally and flattened out. FLIT N FLOT TIME was unhurried around the first turn while racing four to five wide then circled the field on the final turn but was not
