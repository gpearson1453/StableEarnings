Footnotes
VALIANT DEFENDER was allowed to settle around the first turn then made a middle move up the rail on the backstretch, went four wide in upper stretch to
close willingly. MATH MAN was placed off the pace to the final turn, made a three bid on the final turn then engaged the leaders at the eighth pole and was
out finished. NUGGET OF GRACE stumbled at the start then was hustled to the lead to set most of the pace, was headed at the quarter pole and weakened
in late stretch. HESACALENDARBOY tracked the leader from the two path to the five sixteenths pole and engaged the leader to the eighth pole and tired.
UNBRIDLED PULPIT was allowed to settle near the back to the final turn then made a mild bid to improve position. COUNTRY CUT was forwardly placed in
the two path to the five sixteenths and dropped back. ONE HITTER was not a threat.

Footnotes
DEBONNAIRE DUDE was rushed up to track the leader through the final turn then engaged at the eighth pole and took the lead in the final sixteenth and
drew off. LIKEN IT settled in the middle of the pack from the two path through the final turn then moved out to three wide to make a late run to prove second
best. LUNAR LIGHT was allowed to settle around the first turn and down the backstretch then went four wide on the final turn, moved out into upper stretch
to make a late rally. WILSON TO LOCKETT saved ground throughout, then made a mild rail bid on the final turn and faltered. JAKE THE BAND MAN went
to a clear lead to the eighth pole then dueled for a sixteenth in the stretch and tired. GRAB THE MUNNY went four wide into the first turn then stalked the
pace from three wide down the backstretch and weakened. WHENTHEDOVESCRY was always back.

Footnotes

early pace then went three wide on the turn and moved out to four wide in upper stretch to be up for the show. MCKAY was rushed up and engaged the
leader at the three sixteenth pole then dueled to the sixteenth pole and weakened. FLAT OUT FABIO failed to menace. MALIBU MONEY was not a factor.
MACER THE RACER tracked the leaders from the two path and retreated. MR. NUMERO UNO was not a threat.
