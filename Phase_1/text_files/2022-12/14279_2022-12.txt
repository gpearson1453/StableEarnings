Footnotes
MYLIES STAR raced within striking distance, had an outside trip, made a wide bid and got up in time. BAILEY'S CHARM raced within contention, came
around the final turn three wide, made a late bid and finished willingly. SABERFIGHT went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and lacked a late kick.
ASHLEY'S GIRL void of early speed, came around the second turn on the outside, improved position, but was no factor. GALAXY AFFAIR pressed the
pace, faded and was no threat late. SHOTGUN ANNIE always raced near the back and showed little. MISS YELLOW MEADOW was an early factor,
dropped back and was outrun.

COROT pressed the pace from the inside and took the lead at the five sixteenths pole and drew off. CURTIN'S UP was hustled along from five wide on the
backstretch then continued forward from the three path but was no match for the winner. LUKE'S CAJUN STAR raced in the middle of the pack from the two
path and improved position. SUCH was void of speed early and passed tiring rivals. INVINCIBILITY went to the front to take a brief lead then chased the
leader to upper stretch and gave way. TALE OF A STORM saved ground to no avail.

Footnotes
AZTAR was rushed up to take the lead from the inside to set all the pace was kept to task and held on for the win. JAMAICAN ME stalked the pace from the
two path made a two wide bid on the final turn and just missed the win. JAYS HOLIDAY was unhurried through the early stages, then made a three wide bid
going into the turn and proved best of the rest. JOSAN raced in the middle of the pack from the inside made a rail rally through the final turn and faltered.
JIMMIE'S HALO raced near the back to the final turn then was asked in the turn tom make a move and improved position. NINEJUANJUAN CALL raced in
the middle of the pack to the final turn then made a rail bid and passed tiring rivals. BRYKEN N MITCHELL was hustled along to vie for the lead from the
two path and weakened after a half. DUKE OF BLUE RIDGE was forwardly placed in the three path to the final turn and dropped back. WOOD RIVER was
close up early while saving ground but gave way after a half.

Footnotes
NOT SO SWEET went to a clear lead to set all the pace and proved much the best. TENSAS VIRGINIA stalked the pace from three wide and made a late
run for the place. COLD AS YOU was last away, made a rail bid through the turn, moved between horses in mid stretch and finished well. GIRL IN BLACK
stumbled at the start, saved ground through the turn then angled out four wide to improve her position. SEGOVIANA raced back early made a three wide bid
but failed to menace. SHE WANTS HALF hopped at the start, then was hustled along to track the leaders, gave way in the stretch and was vanned off.
SARAH ADRIANA chased the leaders early and tired. STOP THE FRIEND was not a threat.
