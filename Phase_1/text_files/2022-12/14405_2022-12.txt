Footnotes
TREPAT was off a step slow, quickly recovered to set the early pace while racing from the inside of foe and drew off to be well clear under a steady hand
ride. BLAME THE BOURBON prompt the early leader from the outside and was no match for the winner while continuing to race from the outside. READ
THE SPEC stalked the pace early on, raced three wide near the quarter pole and had no final winning bid. GREAT DAYS AHEAD raced mid pack early on,
was near the rail past the five sixteenths pole, angled to race six deep and raced evenly with no closing run. HOPE HE'S FAST was rated along from the
inside to race in hand early and weakened in the drive from the inside. COUNTRY CHARLIE was slow early on and never threatened. I ONCE STOOD
ALONE dropped back early, lost ground and raced far back to never threaten.

Footnotes
ROYAL CRUSADER rated to race in hand early, asked while making a two wide bid near the three eighths pole to take command and raced well clear in the
drive under steady pressure. EKATI'S VERVE stalked the early pace, made a three wide bid near the quarter pole to challenge the leader but was no match
for the winner in the drive. MAMAIGOTTHIS was slow early, made an advance from the outside while racing four to five wide around the far turn and
flattened out in the drive while racing from the outside. UNIDENTIFIED MAN showed good early foot to set the early pace along the inside and gave way.
MINECRAFTER settled off the early pace along the inside and lacked a bid. RESIDENT LIBERAL dropped back early, moved up two wide between nearing
the three eighths pole and was empty. WORLD OF FOOLS was forwardly placed to lay up close from the outside of rival and stopped.

under strong encouragement. SUPREME LAW showed good early speed from the inside to set the early pace and gave way grudgingly late. FRIGHTLAND
was bumped at the start, raced three deep around the far turn, angled to outside to race well off the inside in the drive and moved up. ROCK THE BOAT
was bumped at the start, raced four wide near the quarter pole and kept from the outside. MANOLITO stalked the early pace, raced along the inside around
the far turn and had no final winning bid. ORO DE MORO MORO was off a step slow, move up five to six wide in the lane and close belatedly to improve
position. BOWIE TWO STEP pressed outside of foe, raced four wide into the upper stretch and weakened. ELUSIVE AGENT was bumped soundly at the
start, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. MONSTER MASON broke sharply to the inside, bumped rival, angled in, raced
from the inside into the upper stretch and never threatened. YOUNG TURK was shuffled back at the start, raced four to five wide around the far turn and
