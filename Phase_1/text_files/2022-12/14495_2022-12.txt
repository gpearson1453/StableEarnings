Footnotes
SMARTY ALEX tracked two wide, then from between horses around the far turn, found traffic while shifting out entering the lane, altered course to the
seven path in upper stretch for clear sailing, then rallied in pursuit of the newly leading GOOD OLD CHARLIE in the final furlong, edged up to that foe in the
closing stages, and narrowly prevailed at the wire. GOOD OLD CHARLIE chased outside of the top pair while in the four path and under consistent coaxing
entering the backstretch, got outmoved by an outer pre-mature bidder entering the far turn, tipped outside of that new leader in upper stretch, ranged up to
produce his own bid approaching the furlong grounds, led at that juncture, but flopped back to his left lead while embracing for crossing over track marks left
from the starting gate in the final sixteenth, was confronted by an outer rival in the process, and got caught on the wire. GUITARTUITION PLZZ stalked
along the inside, got outmoved by wider foes around the far turn while awaiting racing room, relegated to trail turning for home while staying committed to a
rail charge, managed to slip through in upper stretch, and finished up willingly. MARTINIZED settled off of the pace in the five path, rallied entering the far
turn to produce an early bid for the lead outside of the top pair at the three furlong pole, gradually drew clear of them nearing the lane, but failed to change
leads in upper stretch as an outer foe took aim, got headed by that foe approaching the final furlong, and yielded between horses. SCORING DRIVE vied for
the lead inside of a rival while a path off of the rail, got headed by an outer bidder at the three furlong pole, and weakened in upper stretch. BATTLE OF
WILL set the pace outside of a vying foe and in the three path, but proved no match for an outer bidder at the three furlong pole, and weakened between
horses entering the lane.

Footnotes
TAKE THE CHARGE opened up around the first turn, relaxed well while getting a breather into the far turn as rivals inched closer, yet readily responded to
rousing with a quarter mile to go, drew away again entering the lane under driving pressure, and was put to wraps at the sixteenth pole. COUNTERSPY
tracked three wide, chased under strong urging around the far turn, then reached place late while not threatening the winner. RIVER BOY tracked in the
three path, inched closer to the rating leader entering the far turn, but failed to keep pace entering the lane, then lost place to an outer rival nearing the wire.
KLIMTOMANIAC laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed, took the far turn two wide, and made little impact. BIG BEEMSTER lost his footing and
bobbled leaving the gates, lacked speed two wide, then faded along the inside turning for home.

Footnotes
CO CONSPIRATOR set the pace inside of a pair of lightly pressing foes down the backstretch, inched clear while in hand around the far turn, then drew off
in upper stretch, but tired in the final furlong, yet safely lasted from an outer rival to the wire. CRIMINAL DEFENSE settled off of the pace in the three path,
shifted four wide in upper stretch, rallied to gain place at the furlong grounds, sustained his charge to gain on the clear leader late, but ran out of ground to
reel him in. MAGAZINE STREET stalked the top trio from the inside, failed to progress despite rider's urging around the far turn, shifted out three wide in
upper stretch while inside of CRIMINAL DEFENSE, ran on to attempt a bid for place coming to the furlong grounds, but was outkicked by that rival at that
juncture. OVERTHOUGHT pressed the pace two wide and between horses, but failed to sustain pressure around the far turn, and gave way. ANICLUDE
pressed three wide, chased around the far turn, and tired. UNORTHODOX was outrun.

FINE COTTON bumped an outer rival at the start, stalked in the two path and behind the pace setter while under a snug hold around the first turn, patiently
bided time in the pocket around the far turn, smoothly split the top pair two wide at the quarter pole, gained command at the three sixteenths marker, and
kicked clear. TALES OF HOME took a bump from an inner rival at the start, pressed the pace three to two wide around the first turn, vied around the far
turn, led turning for home, but was outkicked by an inner bidder at the three sixteenths pole, and was second best. LOTSANDLOTSOFGOLD rated at the
rear two wide, circled rivals with a four wide rush around the far turn to bid entering the lane, but failed to keep pace with an inner pair while hanging on his
left lead leaving the quarter pole, changed over at the three sixteenths marker while vying for show with an inner foe, and prevailed for that position.
LEXINGTON DIVA tracked three wide, but was outmoved by an outer rival turning for home, vied for show with that foe through the lane, but was bested.
SPIRITCATCHER laid off of the pace along the inside, trailed turning for home, swung out to the six path entering the lane, but lacked a bid. LITTLE FAIRY
was a bit antsy in the starting gates, set the pace along the inside, but was headed at the five sixteenths pole, and gave way in upper stretch.

Footnotes
SAENZ set the pace along the inside, drew clear while well in hand leaving the quarter pole, was roused to widen at the three sixteenths pole, and was kept
to task under moderate urging. TATTERED HEART tracked from off of the pace in the two path, tipped out to split foes three wide entering the lane, and ran
on to prove second best. SHE'LL NEVER KNOW broke a bit outwardly at the start, laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out to the five path in upper
stretch before altering to the eight path at the furlong grounds, and moved up. ARKLAHOMA SOUL chased two wide, tipped three wide turning for home,
but yielded while getting floated four wide at the quarter pole, and kept on. HIGH FASHION LADY was herded outwardly at the start by an inner rival, trailed
along the inside, came into the lane in the three path, shifted to the rail in midstretch, but lacked a bid. SWEET SLEW pressed the eventual winner from the
outside, but yielded entering the lane, and weakened between horses while hanging on her left lead in midstretch. FABULOSITY stalked along the inside,
but faded.

Footnotes
TITLED LADY sped clear, showed the way in the two path, mild a mild challenge from an outer CHARRIERE turning for home, yet shook free entering the
lane, drew clear, and held sway while hanging on her left lead under driving pressure. CHARRIERE was brushed by rivals on either side at the start, stalked
three wide while taking the turn in the four path, ranged up to attempt a bid turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the leader leaving the quarter pole,
and was second best. LADY DREAMER stalked while forward in the two path, aimed between the top pair in the three path around the turn, then only
managed to chase them through the lane while best of the rest. ICICLES tracked two wide, tucked behind the leader entering the turn, but only managed to
chase from the rail while green to change leads in upper stretch, and faded. WAIT ON ME laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted to the six path in
upper stretch, but lacked a bid. SENSE OF HEART leaned out at the start, trailed in the four path around the turn, and never got involved. DIVINA DULCE
was outrun along the inside.

Footnotes
GREYS THE BOY laid off of the pace three wide, gained in the four path around the turn, sustained progress to bid at the three sixteenths pole, then drove
past the leaders at the furlong grounds, and drew clear. BOSS' DIALIN IN pushed open the starting gate pre-race, leaned forward without completely
leaving in, then was reloaded, raced forwardly two wide, tucked to the inside entering the turn, chased from behind traffic in upper stretch, altered course
three wide at the furlong grounds after the winner kicked clear, and stayed on well to claim place nearing the final sixteenth. CLOUD WITHOUT REIN broke
through the gates and lost his rider, but failed to slip his grasp and run-off, also reloaded without further incident, sped clear early on, set the pace before
meeting an outer challenge in upper stretch, fended off that foe through midstretch, but offered little resistance to an outer bidder at the furlong grounds then
was outkicked for place soon after. SUPREMELY stalked two wide, bid in upper stretch, vied into midstretch, but was outkicked at the furlong grounds, and
yielded. MASK PATROL broke a step slowly, lacked speed in the three path, shifted to the six path in upper stretch, and chased evenly. G'S MILLION
chased three wide early on, but weakened around the turn. YODASON broke through the gates pre-race, dropped her rider, and jogged for about a furlong
while being corralled by the outrider, came back to be reloaded without more trouble, then tracked along the inside, and faded around the turn.
TRYSTINTHENITEAWAY broke slowly, and got outrun along the inside. ICE AXE broke a step slow at the start, and showed little.

Footnotes
LT. BONURA tracked in midpack in the three path and between horses, toiled while hanging on his left lead through midstretch, changed over in the five
path inside the final furlong, rallied with multiple lengths to find in the final sixteenth, yet surged late to narrowly prevail at the wire. MR. PRIORITY laid off of
the pace in the five path, came into the lane in the seven path, rallied to bid for the lead leaving the furlong grounds, gained an advantage at the sixteenth
pole as an inner rival fought on, but was caught at the wire by an outer on-charging foe. I'LL RAISE YOU tracked along the inside, aimed between horses in
upper stretch, sustained a split while hanging on his left lead to bid along with an outer rival nearing the final sixteenth, but was outkicked at that juncture,
fought on gamely thereafter, but was bested. PERFECT PERIGEE settled far back along the inside, split foes two wide at the three sixteenths pole, gained
behind the leading group in midstretch, shifted outside of them entering the final sixteenth, and ran on. C'MON VE lacked speed two wide, fanned to the
nine path in upper stretch, and stayed on without menacing. GALLANT STAR broke slowly, lagged behind in the four path, them moved up in the center of
the track inside the final furlong. REECE'S PRIORITY sparred for the lead two wide, failed to keep pace while in the four path at the quarter pole, then
weakened between horses in midstretch. QUEST FOR AVETTE battled for the lead inside of a vying foe, shook free at the quarter pole, held sway through
midstretch, but faltered a sixteenth from home. PRAY IDE SING stalked the embattled leading pair from the four path, came into the lane in the six path, and
gave way. KNOCKALITTLELOUDER lacked speed four wide, and faded. LOVEU AND PROUDOFU chased in the two path, and weakened around the turn.
