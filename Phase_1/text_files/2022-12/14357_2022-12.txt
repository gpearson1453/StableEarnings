Footnotes
WOLF EYES trailed into the far turn, circled rivals willingly, drew on even terms for the lead in upper stretch, dug in under left handed urging and got up in
the final strides. GOLDEN TEMPLE pressed the pace two wide for four and one half furlongs, made the lead, set the pace into the stretch, dug in gamely
when joined by the winner but finished second best. ROAD TEST stalked the early pace, moved closer three wide into the far turn then failed to sustain that
bid. HOMEROOM ANGEL failed to menace. MANHATTAN LADY had speed for a half then faded. STYLISH ASH sped to the lead soon after the start, set
the pace for four and one half furlongs, remained close into the stretch then faltered. TUDOX RUE MAJESTIC had good early speed near the inside and
was through after a half.

COWGIRL KIMMIE pressed the pace three wide, took over at the three furlong marker then widened the balance of the trip to win as much the best.
CHARGAREE never far back, had a mild late rally in the three path and finished clear for second. MISS OVER THERE pressed the early pace two wide and
was outfinished inside rivals. SHE'S NOT BLUFFING raced wide and went evenly in the seven path. GO STELLAIRE trailed early, swung wide and passed
tiring rivals in the middle of the racetrack. JOYFUL NOISE had brief speed. PROUD MAID MARIAN was no factor. LA MUNECA away alertly, set the pace
along the inside into the turn then folded.

STORM OF NINETEEN stalked the pace three wide through the turn, made the lead entering the stretch, set the balance of the pace and won under strong
handling. DANZA MAGIC allowed to settle, rallied through the stretch in the four path and finished well clear for second. MISS ELLIE pressed the pace two
wide into the turn, drew on near even terms for the lead between horses two wide then failed to sustain that bid. THE BOOK OF RUTH rushed to the lead
soon after the start, set the pace along the inside for a half then weakened. AUGMENTING ASSETS passed tiring rivals. QUEENIE ROSE unhurried early,
moved up inside rivals on the turn then came up empty. UPTOWN MILLIE failed to menace. BIKINI SO TEENY had brief speed. DIMPLED trailed.

Footnotes
EXCEEDING pressed the pace three then two wide, matched strides the length of the stretch and proved best in a stiff drive. SCARRAZANO trailed outside,
the rider lost his whip at the quarter pole, rallied in the six path under a hand ride and got up for second. SILENCING pressed the pace two wide into the
turn, gained a slight lead, battled the length of the stretch and just missed hanging on. YEARS AGO close up two wide between rivals, was in tight at the
nine sixteenths then the seven sixteenths pole, swung out for the drive and closed a gap late. ALSANAH also in tight at the nine sixteenths pole, was
through early. VERY WEALTHY broke in front, set the pace into the turn then gave way in the stretch. LITTLE EMPIRE was squeezed along the rail nearing
the nine sixteenths pole causing her rider to check hard losing her action and unseated her rider. THE STEWARDS POSTED THE INQUIRY SIGN AND
AFTER REVIEW DISQUALIFIED YEARS AGO FOR INTERFERENCE ON THE BACKSTRETCH AND PLACED HER SIXTH.

Footnotes
SHELLEY'S GEM dueled for the lead two wide into the turn, surged well clear rapidly, set the balance of the pace and prevailed under a strong hand ride.
BACKSPLASH never far back, rallied determinedly inside and got up for second. BLUSHING BETTY close up inside, shifted out to the six path and finished
determinedly. GENERAL GINNY went evenly. L. A. STAR had good early speed and weakened on the turn. QUEENOFCATNIPHILL was no factor.
BAREBACK FUN battled with the winner along the inside into the turn then was used up.
