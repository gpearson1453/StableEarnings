Footnotes
BAKER BLOCK raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, gained ground
and pulled clear late. GET EVEN dueled between horses through the opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle while saving ground around the bend,
was caught in upper stretch and chased the winner home. NOT A DANCE raced off the pace early, navigated the turn from the four path, began a bid
approaching the quarter pole and improved position in the lane. WOOTDAREITIS tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, raced in the two
path around the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. MINISTER QUINN dueled on the outside in the early going, battled from the three path around the
bend and faded in the lane. AGENT MULGANNON veered out leaving the gate, trailed the field up the backstretch, came around the turn in the three path
and made no bid. EDMUND FITZGERALD chased the leaders on the inside through the opening stages, began to drop back while saving ground around
the turn and continued to tire in the stretch.

Footnotes
I'M A CUTIE pressed the pace between horses up the backstretch, took command while racing in the three path around the turn and drew off down the lane
to win handily. G G'S DARK STAR raced in the middle of the pack on the outside early, navigated the turn from the three path and improved position in the
stretch while proving to be no match for the winner. BELLA ROMANCE stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the
four path and finished evenly. LA BRODY raced off the pace through the opening quarter of a mile, continued around the bend in the two path and passed
tiring horses in the lane. SASSY CHARLEE led the field on the inside up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the turn and faded in the stretch.
EXPECT A CIRCUS stumbled and nearly lost her rider a furlong into the race, dropped back to race off the pace up what remained of the backstretch,
navigated the turn from the two and three path and showed no kick from there. WIN OR CELLAR raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, came
around the bend in the two path and tired in the stretch. TWIN BRIDGES hit the gate hard leaving it, trailed the field up the backstretch, saved ground
around the turn and was empty in the lane.

Footnotes
LETS TAKE IT IZZY chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the three path coming around the turn, kicked clear in upper
stretch and held that margin to the wire. WORKING OVERTIME reared up leaving the gate, settled off the pace on the outside for the run up the
backstretch, came around the turn in the four path and gained ground late. VOODAYO raced in the middle of the pack on the inside early, began a bid from
the five path nearing the quarter pole and kept on to the finish. MONIQUES DAREDEVIL was bumped and forced out by the rival to her inside at the break,
raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, navigated the turn from the six path and improved position in the final furlong. ISLA
BONITA tracked the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the bend and faded in the lane. ANNIE UP BUCK raced at the back of
the pack between horses early, came around the turn in the three path and made no bid. TAKESTWOTOWIGGLE veered out sharply and bumped with the
horse to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled from the two path around the bend and tired in the stretch. CALL
HER JOEY bobbled slightly leaving the gate, trailed the field throughout, raced in the two path and was not a factor.
