Footnotes
GRIDDY UP GIRL laid off of the pace in the four path, inched closer to track outside of the top pair with a half mile remaining, gained around the far turn to
sweep past the leader at the quarter pole, then drew clear in upper stretch. TAKEOVER TIME stalked outside of the leader and from the four path around
the first turn, but was outkicked by an outer rival while simultaneously bidding turning for home, and held place late. TAZZHER stalked along the inside, but
came under a strong drive entering the far turn, failed to respond around that bend, but shifted out in upper stretch, and managed to stay on between horses
in the final furlong, yet ran out of ground to reach place. ONECALLTHATSALL laid off of the pace two wide, shifted out to the five path in upper stretch, and
ran on. REINA ACES was a bit antsy pre-race, set the pace in the three path, shifted down to the two path approaching the far turn, but was headed by a
pair of outer bidders leaving the quarter pole, and weakened through the lane. ONE MO TO GO broke slowly, pulled while keen behind rivals approaching
the first turn, checked to trail the field entering the backstretch, and was outrun thereafter.

Footnotes
CAVE CREEK tracked along the inside, bid for the lead inside of the pace setter via a vacated rail, forged an advantage nearing the furlong grounds, and
edged clear. SERIOUSLY SASSY dueled for the lead inside of a rival while remaining a path off of the rail entering the turn, clung to an advantage turning
for home as another outer rival menaced, but left the rail open allowing for CAVE CREEK to slip through in upper stretch, failed to go on with that one
entering the final furlong while hanging on her left lead, yet managed place thereafter. FORBIDDEN FRUIT stalked the top pair from the four path, bid
leaving the five sixteenths pole, but flattened out in midstretch, and lasted for show. QUINN ELLA laid off of the pace in the three path, shifted out five wide
in upper stretch, and offered a mild grind. MELODY ROSE failed to keep pace with the rest of the group in the opening furlong, lagged behind in the three
path around the turn, shifted ground to the eight path in upper stretch, and cut the gap. PRINCESS STELLA (IRE) vied for the lead outside of the pace
setter and from the three path, sparred around the turn before an outer rival joined the fray, but gave way between horses in upper stretch.

Footnotes
REVERENT sped clear early on, enjoyed a wide lead in the two path around the turn, held sway after a chasing foe narrowed the gap entering the lane,
then drew off again through the final furlong while hanging on his left lead. ONDATRACKPIMPERNEL chased the clear leader from the three path around
the turn, inched closer entering the lane, but only offered a meager bid in upper stretch, failed to keep pace approaching midstretch, gave way, yet saved
place from an outer rival late. AUTUMN'S SO FLASHY tracked along the inside, failed to progress in upper stretch before altering course outside of the top
pair nearing the furlong grounds, kept on in pursuit of a tiring rival for place in the late stages, but just missed reeling that one in on the wire. DIGNIFIED N
KRAFTY brushed an inner rival at the start, then was jostled hard and pinched back between horses soon after causing his rider to lose her irons and trail
the field in the aftermath, gained inside of foes nearing the half mile pole, shifted out to the five path approaching the three furlong pole as his rider regained
her irons, sustained progress outside of the top trio turning for home, but flattened out while hanging on his left lead in upper stretch. MINE YOUR BIZ took
a mild brush from an outer rival before bumping and sharing blame in causing tight quarters for that foe soon after, lacked speed towards the rear two wide
into the turn, shifted out in upper stretch, surpassed a wandering foe while hanging on her left lead in midstretch, and sustained improvement in the final
furlong. BROTHER JEFF leaned in at the start, saved ground far off of the pace, but to no avail. ALL OUT WAR got bounced around and squeezed back
between horses soon after the start, trailed three wide into the turn, and was outrun. PUNCHIE was herded inwardly by an outer foe and bumped an inner
rival soon after the start, tracked three wide while taking the turn in the four path, chased from between horses turning for home, gave way in upper stretch,
and drifted out while weakening. A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REVIEWING THE START RESULTING IN NO CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL ORDER OF
FINISH.

Footnotes
AARON'S SPIRIT set the pace in the two path, then drew off through the lane via driving pressure. SPECIAL OPERATOR settled off of the pace in the two
path, awaited racing room leaving the quarter pole, shifted out to the five path to split rivals while commencing a rally at the three sixteenths pole, gained
place at the furlong grounds, and chased the clear leader home. TOP NOTE stalked along the inside, tipped outside of the leader entering the lane to take
aim, but failed to keep pace in upper stretch, lost place to an outer rival at the furlong grounds, and kept on well. GALLANT BUCK stalked the pace setter
from the three path, pressed around the turn, failed to keep pace three wide and between horses at the quarter pole, and yielded among rivals in midstretch.
BACK BEAT trailed in the three path, and never got involved. MORO MAFIA tracked the top pair in the four path around the turn, then tired once floated to
the six path at the three sixteenths pole.

Footnotes
MAD ADAM tracked behind the leaders and in the two path, split them three wide to bid at the half mile pole, led entering the far turn before assuming
command approaching the final three furlongs, and drew off under driving pressure in upper stretch. MOSH PIT laid off of the pace in the three path, tucked
to the rail at the five furlong pole, tipped back two wide while splitting foes turning for home, bid for place inside of OGRE'S LION KING while shifting
outwardly in upper stretch, and secured that position at the furlong grounds. OGRE'S LION KING settled far back along the inside, shifted to the three path
at the five furlong pole, split rivals at the five sixteenths pole to gain place entering the lane, but drifted out leaving the quarter pole as an inner rival
threatened for that position, and was outkicked nearing the furlong grounds. EXCLAIM bumped with an outer rival at the start, lagged behind early on,
gained five wide and outside of rivals around the far turn, but flattened out without reaching contention in upper stretch. COSTELLO'S KITTEN bumped with
an outer rival at the start, vied along the inside, but proved no match for an outer bidder entering the far turn, lost place entering the lane and weakened in
upper stretch. DIALED A DAME made contact with an inner rival at the start, laid off of the p ace in the four path, and failed to factor. PLEASANT VISION
bumped with an inner rival while breaking on top, set the pace outside of that foe, but was headed by rivals on both sides entering the far turn, and
weakened approaching the three furlong pole. MO VODKA prompted the pace setter from the outside while staying a path away from them, which allowed
him to be outmoved by a foe splitting rival nearing the far turn, then weakened between horses turning for home.

Footnotes
HIDDEN CONNECTION stalked the top pair from behind them and in the two path after a bit of a flat-footed beginning, loomed a danger from between
horses turning for home, bid in hand in the three path entering the lane, changed leads and kicked clear at the three sixteenths pole, then widened under
driving pressure before drifting out leaving the furlong grounds, and was put to wraps entering the final sixteenth. IT'SFIFTYSHADETIME bobbled a bit at
the start, lagged behind around both turns, moved out to the six path in upper stretch, yet shifted while commencing a rally leaving the three sixteenths pole,
and progressed to gain place from an outer rival at the sixteenth pole. HANNAH'S HAVEN pressed three to two wide, led at the three furlong pole, dug in to
meet the eventual winner's bid entering the lane, but proved no match at the three sixteenths pole, chased, then lost place to an inner rival a sixteenth from
home. FLATTER ME SILLY laid off of the pace in the three to two paths around the first turn, pursued from between horses down the backstretch, fanned
out to the seven path in upper stretch, and stayed on willingly to miss reaching show. MICROCAP tracked in the two path, ranged up three wide around the
far turn, but was outkicked while floated four wide entering the lane, and gave way. RUSSIAN MAFIA laid off of the pace in the four to five paths, and failed
to factor. PURRFECT set the pace inside of a pressing rival, got headed at the three furlong pole, and weakened at the five sixteenths pole. XTREMA
tracked along the inside, but faded turning for home.

Footnotes
CHARLIE'S TOWN veered in towards open space at the start, set the pace inside of a pressing foe, and drew off in upper stretch under driving pressure
before being ridden out handily late. STEALING APRIORITY tucked two wide and between horses in midpack into the turn, shifted out to the five path in
upper stretch, and rallied to reach place at the wire. HEARTTHROB HALO took a nudge from an outer rival at the start, tracked along the inside, ranged up
outside of the top pair turning for home, but failed to keep pace with the clearing leader before gaining place at the furlong grounds, but was caught at the
wire for that position. MAGNOLIA RIDGE broke slowly and raced far back early on, gained in the five to six path around the turn, but leveled off while
hanging on her left lead. ROCK STAR ALEX rated far back in the three to four paths, swung to the eight path entering the lane, and moved up. WESTERN
STAR lacked speed two wide and between horse, then improved among foes late. JUJU NINETEEN laid off of the pace in the three path around the turn,
floated to the six path in upper stretch, and failed to factor. CALLEN FEELS GOOD broke slowly but evaded trouble by doing so, then saved ground off of
the pace, but to no avail. OURQUICKDRAWMCGRAW pressed two wide, but weakened in upper stretch. K T'S JILTED GROOM hopped while spotting the
leaders many lengths at the start, and was outrun. HALF A DOODLE chased in the four path, then faded in the five path around the turn.
