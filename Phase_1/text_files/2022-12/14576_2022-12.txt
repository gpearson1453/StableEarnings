up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second turn, was caught in upper stretch and chased the winner home. DIAL HIM UP raced in the

outside late. LORD OF THE NILE raced in the four path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, navigated the far turn
from the three path and finished evenly. POSEIDONS MYTH raced in the two path early, continued up the backstretch off the pace on the inside, came
around the far turn still in the two path and made no bid. ANDY WALKS WITH ME raced in the two path through the opening quarter of a mile, chased the
leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the two path and faded in the lane. BEN RUMSON raced in the two path

LADY FRIJOLES was reluctant to load, broke well to lead the way up the backstretch, dueled from the three path around the turn, dug in in the stretch and
pulled clear. ACACIAHELPME raced in the middle of the pack on the inside through the opening quarter of a mile, saved ground around the turn and gained
ground in late stretch. BEAUTY QUIST pressed the pace on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the bend in the three path and kept on to the
wire. BOW DRAW chased the leader on the inside in the early going, challenged from the two path headed into the turn, dueled in upper stretch and
weakened in the final furlong. CLAY'S MOON STONE raced off the pace on the outside up the backstretch, came around the turn in the four path, swung
wide into the stretch and was outkicked in the lane. DAILY BRIEFING raced off the pace between horses through the opening stages, navigated the turn
from the two path and never threatened. STYLE trailed the field throughout, raced in the three path around the turn and made no bid.
