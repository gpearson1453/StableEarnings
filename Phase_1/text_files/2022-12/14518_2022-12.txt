Footnotes
PSYCHEDELIC set a clear uncontested pace along the inside down the backstretch and into the far turn, was cued from the two path turning into the
stretch, responded well and maintained a clear advantage to the wire. TURF ACCOUNTANT had a slow start and rated from the four path early, was ridden
from the five path into the stretch, and ran on for place. ALWAYS ROYAL chased along the inside, swung out to the six path going into the stretch, and kept
on to get up inside the final furlong for show. BET THE HOWES tracked the pace from the three path, was coaxed from said position turning into the stretch,
but flattened. GO MIKA stalked the pace from the two path, was asked going into the far turn, but was tired entering the lane. SHE'S RED HOT trailed
throughout from the two to three path. DUE TO A TIMER MALFUNCTION THIS RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

Footnotes
GRAND BEY stalked the duel two wide, angled widest in upper stretch, closed outside, was up near the sixteenth pole and edged away under left-handed
urging. MARLEY LUCK pressed the pace in the three path, took the lead leaving the eighth pole but was unable to hold off the winner in the last sixteenth.
NATIONAL UNITY set the pace in the two path, led past the eighth pole and held well enough for the show. CHRISTENSEN saved ground in range, bid
inside of the pacesetter nearing the eight pole but weakened through the final furlong. CLASSY BOY trailed in the two path. PER RULING FROM THE
FLORIDA RACING COMMISSION, GRAND BEY WAS DISQUALIFIED FOR POSITIVE TEST.

Footnotes
EASY AS A. B. C. set the pace from inside, opened up when cued from the three path going into the stretch, was much the best, and was wrapped up late.
MOUSEFAST was bothered by an outer rival at the start and had to steady early, tracked the pace between foes into the turn, was ridden from the five path
going into the lane, and finished evenly for place. SEAX raced from off the pace in the five path going into the turn, swung out to the seven path going into
the stretch, and passed tiring rivals to get show honors. ALDO'S DREAM prompted the pace from the three path into the turn, but faded from said position in
the stretch. DISCREETLY THRIFTY trailed into the stretch, and never threatened. ANDYLITHIC broke inwards at the start bothering an inner foe, was in
tight along the inside around the five eighths pole, and was empty going into the stretch. ZACH AND JILL chased from the four path into the turn but was no
menace.

Footnotes
SPICY GINGER pressed the pace in the three path, took over near the five-sixteenths marker and readily drew off while ridden out. AVE FENIX settled off
the pace while racing four wide and ran on to gain the place without threatening the winner. MARTHAMAYWHOVIER prompted the pace from the rail, could
not keep pace with the winner in upper stretch and held on well enough for third. WILDCAT STAR was fractious in the starting gate, set the pace in the two
path and tired in the lane. DELTA RED failed to menace while racing two wide. SONGTELLER chased the pace three wide and came up empty in the lane.
LADY LOOKOUT trailed inside.

Footnotes
MO HAWK set the pace along the inside, was cued from to open up from the two path turning into the stretch, responded well but began to shorten stride
inside the final furlong, and just held on. JOURNEYMAN trailed from the four path early, angled out and moved up from the five path around the far turn,
tipped out to the six path going into the stretch, and rallied in the final furlong to get place honors. PRINCIPLED STAND (GB) was hard held while prominent
from the three path early, was roused from the four path turning into the stretch, and kept on to hold show. BORDER TOWN had an awkward start and rated
from the two path early, was coaxed while shifting out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and stayed on down the center. UNCLE CURLY stalked the
pace in the four path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but flattened. EXTRASEXYBIGDADDEE chased the pace from the three path but faded
in the stretch. DOMINATE THEMOMENT raced from off the pace in the two path, swung out to the eight path going into the lane, but was no factor.
INHALATION (GB) tracked the pace along the inside but dropped out around the far turn.

DEVIL'S CAY set a pressured pace along the rail and drew off under a drive. FIFTY ONE FIFTY tracked the pace four wide, bid nearing the quarter pole,
was no match for the winner in the lane but stayed on to be clearly 2nd best. DREAM ON BABY pressed the pace two wide between foes, could not keep
pace with the winner nearing the quarter pole and held third. WINOOSKI was outrun inside. BREAK THE ICE had early speed outside, chased in the two
path around the turn and retreated through the lane. CHANGEORDERSONNY played no factor while racing two wide. DONTONIO was never involved.
TRIPLE START prompted the pace three wide, dropped back and switched leads late on the turn, was pulled up in deep stretch and walked off.

swept past a pair of inner rivals inside the final sixteenth to win. LEGENDS CAN'T DIE set the pace in the two path, was cued when headed by an outer foe
along the rail around the three eighths pole, dug in and held off that foe from the two path in the stretch, but was caught by a late charging outer foe in
closing stages to finish with place honors. PACO'S PICO bumped with an outer rival at the start, prompted the pace from the four path into the turn, was
cued to bid from two wide near the three eighths pole, sustained that bid while being ridden back out to the four path at the top of the lane, but evened out
inside the final furlong for show. CATTIN raced prominently from the three path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but was one paced. PALACE
KITTEN was bumped by an inner rival and had to steady at the start, rated from the three path, tucked inside around the turn, but flattened in the stretch.
SHIVAREE bumped an outer foe at the start, chased from the five path but never factored. HAMMER LANE had an awkward beginning and was in tight
early, trailed from the four path and never threatened. DR POST was hustled along from the three path and never menaced. SECRET ALLIANCE got
bumped by an inner rival, raced from wellback along the inside and was done early.

Footnotes
FULL DISCLOSURE dueled two wide to deep stretch and inched ahead late. MEETMEINKINGSTON dueled inside of the winner to deep stretch and gave
way grudgingly. CITY MISCHIEF stalked the pace three wide, had aim four wide in upper stretch but could not gain on the winner. NOT PHAR NOW tracked
the pace two wide, tipped three wide in upper stretch, was in somewhat tight through the stretch and was outdueled for the show. ENBARR was shut off and
forced to check soon after the start, raced well back in the two path, angled out in the stretch and rallied belatedly. KING CAB slammed into the starting gate
and was off well last, advanced four wide around the turn, continued on the left lead in the lane and evened out. DETROIT CITY had some early speed
inside, steadied entering the turn, was shuffled back inside around the bend, swung out in upper stretch and never threatened. ALWAYS HOPEFUL
bumped with DR. DUKE at the start, checked about a sixteenth into the race, raced three wide and was no menace. DR. DUKE was bumped at the start,
raced off the pace two wide, swung five wide in upper stretch and lacked the needed rally. ROMAN POET had only brief speed inside.

Footnotes
SMOOTH RICO bumped with an outer rival at the start, dueled for the lead while two wide, took control and was cued to open up from the four path entering
the stretch, responded well while drifting in, and held sway. MR. AMERICAN got bumped by FAR FROM HOME at the start and then again by said foe
shortly thereafter, raced from off the pace along the inside, was roused from the four path turning into the lane, and rallied between rivals inside the final
furlong to get up for place. BERNARDO'S LEGACY prompted the pace while four wide, was ridden from said position into the lane, and kept on in the
stretch to hold on for show honors. MIDNIGHT GETAWAY bumped with an inner rival at the start, raced prominently while three wide, lost ground early
around the turn, tipped out to the five path going into the stretch, and finished evenly. BLUE MAVERICK chased in the five path, was driven from the six
path into the stretch, but flattened. REDISUR got bumped on both sides at the start, rated in the three path, swung out to the seven path going into the
stretch, and was no threat. COSMIC SPECULATION dueled for the lead from inside but gaveway in the final furlong. FAR FROM HOME bumped an inner
rival twice leaving the gate, tracked the pace from the three path, was cued from inside entering the lane, was short of room and in traffic passing the eighth
pole, and failed to factor.
