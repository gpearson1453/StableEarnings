Footnotes
DUNDER BOSS stalked the pace, circled the turn three wide, swept to command in upper stretch then pulled away while kept to her business. FIVE STAR
FRAN saved ground around the turn stalking the pace, was taken to the three path entering the stretch and gained the place. CAMI RACHELLE set a
pressured pace along the inner rail and gave way. HELLA ELLA lacked speed, hugged the inner rail around the turn, swung to the five path in upper stretch
and passed tired horses. GOLDEN BLOSSOM prompted the pace outside the winner to the stretch and gave way. JIMMYDABOOK , two wide chasing the
pace around the turn, gave way. LET'S MAKE A ZEEN was outrun. SUPER JO JO , unhurried down the backstretch, was not a factor.

Footnotes
BACKATYA broke well and took command inside rivals, set a rated and pressured pace while about two wide, moved clear around the far turn, widened
without much asking around the turn, responded to right handed asks and opened up in mid stretch, continued to wide under solid hand urging past the
sixteenth marker then was geared down in the final strides. FORTH settled off the early pace, angled out leaving the far turn, came three wide for the drive
and churned on willingly to the inside of ADDY'S LADDY T N T and out kicked that one for the place. ADDY'S LADDY T N T , hard ridden while saving
ground and edging up mid turn, shifted out four wide for the drive, gave willing chase past mid stretch then flattened out very late. AMICALOLA FALLS
forced the early pace between rivals, dropped back leaving the three eighths and came up empty. BOWIE TWO STEP rated outside early, made a mild run
three to four wide past the five sixteenths, had aim into the lane, failed to kick on and faded. SPRITZER , four wide outside rivals while in range to the turn,
gave chase through the turn, shifted in a bit for the drive and gave way. ETCHED IN STONE , sluggish away, lost contact early and eased eased late.

Footnotes
HONOR YOUR MOTHER settled off the pace while about four wide, came under ride leaving the three eighths pole, shifted out a bit entering the lane,
closed steadily under left handed encouragement and forged past the embattled leaders in deep stretch to prove best. MERAVIGLIOSO , four and three
wide tracking the pace, was pushed along mid turn, moved up and took a slim lead between rivals in mid stretch, held a slim lead while emerging in a duel
to the inside of MISS CASEY, kept on gamely but could not fend off the winner's charge. MISS CASEY , off last after hesitating at the break, rushed up five
wide entering the turn and established a stalking position, kept on under coaxing and ranged up outside rivals to challenge in mid stretch, fought valiantly
outside MERAVIGLIOSO past the sixteenth pole then gave way grudgingly between foes. FORTUNATA ITALIA broke inward and bumped with a rival at the
break, regrouped and settled towards the inside, came off the rail and was put to asking around the turn, swung five wide into the stretch and closed
willingly. LITTLE BIT OF THAT broke sharp and took control early, set the pace about three wide into the turn, came in some when clearing and was nursed
along around the turn, kept on under pressure past the three sixteenths, failed to contain rivals leaving mid stretch and gave way. TAM CHAR was sent up
between foes early, chased three to four wide from the three eighths and churned on to bridge the gap. NOTION INTERRUPTUS broke a step slow, lagged
back while towards the inside, came off the inside mid turn, swung six to seven wide for the drive but lacked a serious response. ILLUSION OF HOPE
saved ground, moved up a bit past mid stretch then flattened out. SHINELIKEADIAMOND flashed speed, dropped back off the leaders leaving the far turn,
came three wide for the drive and faded. PLEASE MARRY ME stalked towards the inside, failed to keep pace under pressure mid turn, came two wide for
the drive and weakened. SALAMINA lacked speed, swung out in upper stretch but failed to menace.

path turning for home, gained a short lead inside the winner in upper stretch and finished willingly. MOSLER SAFE circled foes on the turn, was four deep
entering the stretch and offered a slight rally. STRONGER THAN DEX showed speed in the two path entering the turn, faded in the drive. CENTAVO
bumped with the winner leaving the starting gate, entered the stretch in the two path and failed to be a factor. THRUSTER hugged the inner rail on the turn,
swung to the five path in upper stretch and was not a factor. SUPERSTITIEUX , no factor, raced very wide for the drive. DEJOHN , wide on the turn, was
not a factor. NEVER SILENCED raced in the three path on the turn and was not a factor. SUNDAY MISCHIEF showed speed along the inner rail and

Footnotes
JACKSON'S DIXIE rated forwardly while four wide nearing the half, edged up and bid three deep to take over three furlongs out, spurted clear under some
hand urging mid turn, repelled an outside challenge from ME DARLIN KATHLEEN nearing mid stretch, kicked away under a drive then held firm while
steadily hand ridden the final seventy yards. HAPPY TIME broke slowly, was urged off the pace and off the rail leaving the far turn, came three wide into the
lane, advanced between runners leaving mid stretch, shifted in and kept on willingly to nab the place at the wire. ME DARLIN KATHLEEN , between rivals
while not far back, took closer order past the five sixteenths, angled out four wide with momentum into the stretch, threatened the winner past the three
sixteenths, failed to match strides soon after and gave way grudgingly. BALI HAI , inside rivals while chasing leaving the far turn, worked outward under
pressure to be five wide into the lane, straightened and kept on with interest. BABKA , four wide outside rivals leaving the far turn, was under asking mid
turn, shifted out wider for the drive and came up empty. SISTER SPIRIT prompted the pace, bid between foes to challenge after a half, pursued to the
winner while saving some ground into the lane, failed to kick on leaving mid stretch and weakened. CARMEL SUNRISE , off the pace, angled four wide
nearing the quarter pole and failed to respond. WAVERLEY saved ground while chasing the early pace, dropped back leaving the far turn, raced two wide
into the stretch and continued a retreat. EXCLUSIVE ROSE took over inside rivals leaving the chute and cleared, set the pace towards the rail, gave little
resistance when hooked near the three eighths and faltered. WILD N' SASSY drifted out at the break, corrected and dropped back sharply, saved ground
into the lane and failed to kick in.

Footnotes
AUSPICIOUS LAD , taken to the inner rail leaving the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and steadily drew off through the stretch while kept under
encouragement. FEDERAL OFFENSE , three deep stalking the pace around the turn, finished willingly. FRENCHBORO , well placed behind horses around
the turn, swung out in upper stretch and was not a threat. HELLMAN raced in the two path between horses around the turn and gave way through the
stretch. BALTIMORE BULLEIT raced in the two path between horses on the turn, angled out for the drive and was no factor. GOD IS LOVE , outrun, raced
along the inner rail on the turn. THE LAST SCIP bobbled on the winner's heels near the five eights pole, hugged the inner rail on the turn and gave way.
BODE LYNX , four wide on the turn, retreated through the stretch.

Footnotes
PROPER ATTIRE quickly went clear then dropped in several paths in the opening sixteenths, set a rated pace towards the inside, moved away past the five
sixteenths, was put to firm asking leaving mid stretch and held firm. AWESOME VIEW chased outside a rival early on, advanced to the inside of BEHIND
THE COUCH in mid stretch and kept on gamely to earn the place. BEHIND THE COUCH edged up three wide nearing the half mile marker and tracked the
winner, came under a ride past the five sixteenths, gave hard chase past mid stretch then gave way grudgingly. MY BOSS LADY broke slowly, steadied off
heels early, angled out, raced four wide under a hustling ride into the lane and churned on without threatening. LITTLE MS SCARLET was checked sharply
when trying to advance along the rail in the opening furlong, dropped back several lengths, angled three wide but came up empty. MADERA , in close near
the five eighths, came wide for the drive and failed to menace. CANADIAN GINGER checked and altered in when the winner was being angled in nearing
the five eighths, made a mild inside move after recovering, chased to mid turn then gave way. MRS. DEL dropped back inside.

Footnotes
CASH KID lacked speed, swung to the six path entering the stretch, bore in when challenging for the lead outside GIVE IT A GO approaching the eighth
pole, dueled with that one and narrowly prevailed. GIVE IT A GO moved up inside horses entering the far turn, moved to the three path approaching the
stretch, bid for the lead in upper stretch and dueled inside the winner in the drive. UNCOMMON VALOR , rank at the break, worked between horses on the
far turn and rallied. CODIGO , caught behind a wall of horses leaving the far turn, swung to the eight path in upper stretch and passed tired foes. ONLY
CHILD showed speed along the inner rail and weakened in the stretch. SO THERE showed speed in the two path and tired. I'M NOT SLOW , four wide both
turns, was fanned five wide entering the stretch and weakened. PURSUING PACE broke slowly, raced in the three path between horses the far turn, floated
to the four path turning for home and gave way. MANKLIN CREEK lacked speed and was not a factor. NEVERFOLD gained a three wide lead on the far
turn and gave way.
