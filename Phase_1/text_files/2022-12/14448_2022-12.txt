Footnotes
RED HOT LASS tracked three wide to turn, dueled, took over, clear, lasted. ALMADRINA (GB) unhurried early, angled wide into stretch, finished well too
late. DEEP DISH awkward start, rushed to contend to the stretch, faltered late. DIFFERENTBUTOK inside trip throughout with no late kick in the late going.
MERRY OF SOUL broke sharp, lagged back, closed gap in the stretch too late. PELLETIER broke slow, roughed up into the first turn and never menaced
thereafter. STORMY WAGER inside speed dueled to the turn, gave way with little resistance. LAKE BARKLEY no speed throughout with nothing left in the
stretch run. JOY ENAMORADA dueled from two path early on with a steady retreat back. MISS GETTY UP through early from inside dropped back readily.
SMILE AT THE STORM raced erratic throughout while always far back, hard to handle.

Footnotes
RAVELLA sped from two path to the front, roused quarter pole, well clear. ROSIA BAY good position to far turn, split horses with a late run for place.
FIDDLE close up early on, lost position to far turn, came again for show. AWESOME ALLY VEE taken back from the gate, lagged back with a gain stretch.
SWEETS MAKER no speed to the far turn, mild gain in the final stages. OFF THE CHARTS slow into stride, never improved much throughout. REVERB
outside chase to far turn, could not go on and faded readily. MEGAN'S NOEL never menaced throughout. SUCH SOUNDS stalked pace pace from inside to
the half, gave way readily. SPIRIT DANCE raced back with a middle move to far turn, faded readily. MY SWEETNESS never menaced. ANYQUIST tracked
between horses to the half with nothing left in the drive. THE FINAL TIME WAS CHANGED DUE TO THE FINISH BEAM BEING MISPLACED.

Footnotes

in the stretch, flattened out for place spot. ROLLESTON inside speed to turn, off rail in the stretch run for show spot. CLAIRARIFIC between horses up
close, bid into turn, flattened out stretch. DEAR BEAU (IRE) no speed to turn, widest run in the stretch to improve late. GIRLS HOUSE raced evenly with no
late response when needed. HONEYCOMB raced evenly along to turn, flattened out in the stretch run. PUGLIA failed to contend. TIME FOR CUPID dueled
to the quarter pole, gave way readily in the lane. SHE'S A KEEPER close up with a bid into turn, could not go on and faded back. QUIET PRETTY KITTY
broke awkward from the gate and never a menace throughout.
