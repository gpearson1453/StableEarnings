Footnotes
CHROME FINISH tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, asked through the far turn and finished well to get up under strong handling while
racing three to four deep. SUTTON VALLEY was quick to begin to set the early pace, had a clear lead near the eighth pole, dug in inside the sixteenth
marker but was wore down in a game effort. WHAT'S MY CATEGORY settled off the early pace to race mid pack early on, moved up four to five wide in the
drive and closed in well late on the top pair in a willing effort. MR BOLDACIOUS was off slowly, raced near the back of the pack after the slow start, moved
up from the inside around the far turn, raced near the rail in the drive and made a good late bid. U U STAR stalked the top pair from the inside and
weakened i the stretch run. DREAMERS REWARD was unhurried early to race in hand, raced five to six wide into the upper stretch and had not enough.
WINNERS WIN dropped back early, raced three wide past the quarter pole and lacked a bid.

Footnotes
LTL BEAR SALOON was quick to begin to set an unpressured early pace, ridden along through the far turn and drew off to be well clear while under strong
handling. SAILOR SPEED tracked the early leader while racing just off the inside, ridden along near the three eighths pole but was no match for the winner
in the drive. ONCE A GIANT stalked the pace along the inside, hard ridden through the far turn and had not enough for the top pair while racing near the
rail. LUDO settled off the early going, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and lacked a rally. BLACK IRISH broke awkwardly, angled in soon after
the start, raced near the inside throughout and had no late run. STILL THE ONE raced mid pack early, was five wide into the upper stretch, lost ground and
raced far back.

Footnotes
SOUTH HOUSE showed good early foot while racing three wide to the outside of foes while setting the pace and drew off to be well clear under strong
handling. HIGHWAY QUEEN chased the early leader from the inside and finished second best. LOOP THE LOOP lunged at the start, raced near the inside
around the far turn through the stretch and moved up to improve position. FALL CAMPAIGN was forwardly placed to lay up close, raced in a bit tight near
the three eighths pole and weakened while racing four wide. SEEKING THE THRONE was off slowly, raced three wide around the far turn and never
menaced.
