Footnotes
SHES THE NORTH chased the pace from the six path, was ridden in the five path turning into the lane, rallied while four wide inside the final furlong, and
got up in closing strides. MOSLER'S IMAGE bumped slightly with WICKED MERCURY leaving the gate, stalked in the three path, was roused from the two
path going into the stretch, bid to the inside of a trio of foes in the final furlong, and ran on to get place honors. WICKED MERCURY bumped slightly with
MOSLER'S IMAGE at the start, rated from the four path, loomed up from the six going into the lane, and kept on while five wide in the final furlong for show
honors. MACHISIMA set the pace in the three path, was roused when headed from said position turning into the stretch, responded well and dug in before
yielding in the final sixteenth. KENTUCKY PRIDE raced off the pace in the four path, was driven from the five path into the stretch, shifted in while looking
for room passing the eighth pole, but was no factor. HARDLY SOCIAL trailed from the six path into the stretch and was no menace. EMIRATES AFFAIR
was keen from the four path around the first turn, raced prominently from said position, was cued to bid turning into the stretch, but was outrun late. TIMES

Footnotes
ALLAGASH RUN pressed the pace in the three path, took over nearing the five-sixteenths marker, drew off in upper stretch and held well clear while ridden
out. LAST DREAM bumped at the start, saved ground off the pace, angled out in upper stretch and ran on for the place. TACTICAL FORCE raced off the
pace two wide, angled in in upper stretch and was along for the show. BREEZY CONNECTION chased the pace two wide, angled four wide near the
quarter pole and faded. WARP SPEED BEAST set the pace in the two path and gave way near the five-sixteenths marker. UNCLE MARK bumped at the
start, raced in range three and four wide and came up empty in the lane. DEVIL'S MYTH hit the starting gate then was pinched back soon after the start,
raced four and five wide and never threatened.

Footnotes
STRASBOURG bumped with CHIQUIRIN out of the gate, tracked along the inside, tipped out to the five path under rousing going into the stretch, bid
passing the eighth pole and drew clear. THE TWINS SNEAKERS had a slow start and raced from wellback in three path early, swung out to the eight path
under urging entering the stretch, and rallied down the center to get up for place. FISHING FOR FUN stalked the pace in the two path, shifted inside in
upper stretch, and evened out for show. MUNDO MIX set the pace just off the rail along the inside, was ridden from the four path into the lane, but faded
passing the eighth pole. CHIQUIRIN bumped with STRASBOURG at the start and was hustled along from a tracking position in the four path, was coaxed
from three wide around the turn, floated out to the seven path into the lane, but flattened. LOVE ME ARCHIE was always behind in the three to five paths.

Footnotes
JRUE BREEZE stalked the pace in the clear in the three path, took the lead near the quarter pole, dueled outside of PAPA KATZ from there while sticking
on the left lead and narrowly prevailed. PAPA KATZ pressed the pace two wide, bid between foes nearing the quarter pole, continued on the left lead in the
lane, battled on gamely inside of the winner under hand urging and just missed. CORPORATE AFFAIR set the pace along the rail, could not match strides
with the top two in upper stretch, angled out nearing the eighth pole and held clear of the rest. TRAPPE THE WIND failed to menace while racing four wide.
MORE THAN GRAY trailed inside.

Footnotes
ISLAND SWAGGER set the pace in the two path, was coaxed from the four path while being challenged by an outside IMPOSTER SYNDROME turning into
the stretch, dug in and took a slight bump from said foe going into the final furlong, fought on and held sway. SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR bumped with
PEOPLE FORCE just after the start, chased in the five path, shifted inward to the two path passing the eighth pole and rallied to get up for place. PEOPLE
FORCE bumped with SOUPERSILVERDOLLAR after the start, trailed from the three path early, moved up going into the far turn, was ridden from the five
path into the stretch, and ran on for show. RULE IT tracked in the four path, swung out to the seven path turning into the lane, and kept on. IMPOSTER
SYNDROME raced keenly from the five path early, bid while in hand from said position around the far turn, was roused from the seven path into the stretch,
floated inwards and brushed the eventual winner passing the eighth pole, and flattened out late. HOLIDAY FANTASY rated along the inside but faded in the
stretch. CATALINA EXPRESS prompted the pace in the four path but gaveway around the far turn. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

THENORTHREMEMBERS settled off the pace inside, angled four wide in upper stretch, closed between rivals, took the lead near the sixteenth pole and
inched ahead. DUCHOSSOIS saved ground in midpack, bid at the rail in upper stretch, led to the sixteenth pole and gave way grudgingly. HEAT OF THE
NIGHT steadied early, raced off the pace three and four wide and rallied to gain the show in the final strides. KITTEN'S SPA raced in range three and four
wide, bid in upper stretch and flattened out late. KING THEO failed to menace while racing two wide. DAZZLING TRUTHS chased the pace three and four
wide and lacked the needed rally. PRINCE AMADEUS had his head turned at the start, advanced inside while keen around the first turn, bid in the three
path rounding the far turn but weakened through the lane. INCITATUS set a clear pace in the two path and faltered in midstretch.

Footnotes
OLIVIA DARLING was sent from the gate to lead from the two path, was cued to open up turning into the lane, responded well while drifting out slightly late,
and held clear. SCARLET STRIPE stalked in the four path, loomed up under rousing to take aim from the five path entering the lane, and ran on to secure
place. AMERICAN TAP chased in the five path, was roused while angling out to the seven path going into the stretch, and finished evenly for show honors.
DOLL BABY was coaxed along from the six path into the turn, swung out to the eight path going into the stretch, and flattened. BLUSTERY rated in the
three path, cut the corner entering the lane, but faded. POIEMA pressed the pace from the five path into the turn but gaveway between rivals going into the
stretch. MISZLO trailed throughout.

Footnotes
SWEET ENOUGH (GB) led early, settled back in the two path rounding the first turn, saved ground in range from there, tipped out in upper stretch, moved
to the front nearing the sixteenth pole and quickly drew clear. TRAFFIC SONG hit the starting gate, moved three wide to the lead early on the first turn,
cleared off and angled in down the backstretch, led past the eighth pole, was no match for the winner late but stayed on to hold the place. LADY DAY (FR)
saved ground in range, tipped out near the eighth pole and ran on between foes for the show. MY CANDY GIRL was bumped at the start, raced off the pace
two wide, angled to the rail in upper stretch and improved position inside of foes. BEECHNUT TROPHY raced in range two and three wide, swung five wide
turning for home and was one-paced through the lane. SONAR was bumped at the start, raced three and four wide and never threatened. MISS BONNIE T
raced off the pace four wide, made a middle move outside, bid nearing the five-sixteenths marker but faded in the lane. STARSHIP NTERPRISE was
bumped between rivals at the start, raced well back inside and made little impact. ROSEBUD'S HOPE stalked the pace three wide, came up empty in the
lane and was eased late. STARSHIP NANA had her head turned at the start, raced well back two and three wide, swung seven wide in upper stretch and
had no closing bid. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

Footnotes
THRILLING BABY rated in the six path, followed the advancing move of KESTENNA from the five path around the far turn, was driven back out to the six
path going into the stretch, rallied to bid outside of said rival passing the eighth pole, and swept past in the final sixteenth to win. HOT BODE tracked along
the inside, made progress along the rail around the far turn, ran on to bid from the two path passing the eighth pole, and got up late for place. KESTENNA
(GB) broke outwards and bumped into CAPRIDREY out of the gate, chased in the five path, moved up to bid four wide around the far turn, was roused to
lead while going back out to the five path entering the stretch, and kept on but was caught by a pair of rivals inside the final furlong to finish with show
honors. CAPRIDREY got bumped around hard between foes leaving the gate, raced off the pace in the five path, swung out to the eight path going into the
stretch, but was one paced. BEAUTIFUL STAR raced prominently between rivals early, was hustled from the six path turning into the lane, but flattened.
ROSA STAR prompted the early pace from the four path but faded in the stretch. SWEET ACTRESS bumped with CAPRIDREY at the start, was behind
while angling out to the eight path in upper stretch, and never threatened. CALIFORNIA GIGI raced in midpack from the four path, steadied slightly
approaching the far turn, tucked in to the rail around the far turn, but was no menace. PERFECT KIMBERLY S set the pace in the two path but gaveway
entering the lane. KARENVILLE stalked in the five path early but was empty going into the stretch. KARENVILLE WAS VANNED OFF.
