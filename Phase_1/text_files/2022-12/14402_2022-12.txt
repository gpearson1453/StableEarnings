Footnotes
TRABIESO AVELITO was forwardly placed in the early going, encountered traffic in the first furlong, stalked the moderate pace, raced two wide on the turn,
advanced in upper stretch, overtook HOLYJAZZ inside of the furlong marker and kept to task in deep stretch to prevail. INDIANERA raced in traffic in the
early stages, checked nearing the five-furlong marker, steadied entering the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch,
could not reel in the winner in the final stages and finished well to earn the place. TIZ A THRILL was prominent in the early going, stalked the moderate
pace three deep on the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and was just edged for second while holding for third. TOM'S MOON
tracked the early pace, raced two wide to the quarter marker, advanced in the drive but could not produce the needed late response. HOLYJAZZ was sent
to the early lead, cleared the field and moved to the rail in the opening furlong, set moderate fractions through the turn, extended the lead nearing the
quarter marker, came under pressure in mid-stretch, was overtaken inside of the furlong pole and gave way. FRISCO KID chased the early pace, lost
position while two wide on the turn and lacked a late rally. HAKUNUI chased the early moderate pace, slipped to the inside along the turn, was not able to
keep pace in upper stretch and weakened. THERE WAS A STEWARDS INQUIRY INTO THE FIRST FURLONG OF THE RACE. IN A UNANIMOUS
DECISION, THE STEWARDS RULED THAT HOLYJAZZ INITIATED CONTACT ON TRABIESO AVELITO WHO IN TURN IMPEDED INDIANERA. THE
STEWARDS DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT DID NOT AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE AND DECLARED THERE WOULD BE NO
CHANGE. A JOCKEY'S OBJECTION WAS ALSO LODGED BY THE RIDER OF INDIANERA, WHICH THE STEWARDS DISALLOWED.

Footnotes
ROUSING JEWEL was brushed leaving the gate by MAJESTIC OOPS, stalked the moderate pace to the turn, advanced three wide on the turn, assumed
command nearing mid-stretch, shook free from ELECTRIC LETTUCE inside of the furlong marker and held in a drive at the end. ELECTRIC LETTUCE took
back in the early going to stalk the moderate fractions, advanced along the rail nearing the quarter marker, continued that bid in upper stretch, vied for the
lead nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with ROUSING JEWEL in deep stretch and was second best. HOW ABOUT A FRESCA rated off of
the early pace, raced two wide on the turn, swung six wide for the drive, closed in the final furlong, was not able to impact the leaders in deep stretch and
was up for third in the final strides. MAJESTIC OOPS broke in at the start and brushed ROUSING JEWEL, settled off of the early pace, saved ground
through the turn, swung five wide for the drive and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. BET DE VRON showed early speed, set a pressured pace to the
quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch and faded in the final stages. JUANA GALLO pressed the moderate early pace, kept close attendance to the
pacesetter to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
TALK ABOUT AUTISM was close up to the early pace, pressed the pacesetter to the quarter marker, battled with FASTTRAINTOTEXAS to mid-stretch,
shook free from that rival and kicked clear in the final stages. ZHIVAGO was forwardly placed in the early stages, raced a bit in tight entering the turn,
stalked the moderate pace to the quarter marker, was outkicked in the drive and stayed on to secure second in a blanket finish for the minor awards.
PERFORMATIVE tracked the moderate early pace, advanced along the inside nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch, re-rallied in deep
stretch and just missed for second, while earning the nod for third. FASTTRAINTOTEXAS broke alertly and established the early lead, set moderate
fractions while pressed through the turn, battled with TALK ABOUT AUTISM to mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and was just edged for the minor
awards. SUN AND SURF stalked the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, could not keep pace in the drive and gave way. SLIGHTLY DIRTY was
unhurried early on, raced three wide on the turn and did not threaten. CORK MASTER lunged at the break and was away a step slowly, lacked early speed,
raced two wide on the turn and did not factor.

Footnotes
SUNNY SPOT was well placed in the early stages, raced along the inside into the second turn, angled out and mounted a three wide bid nearing the top of
the lane, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, made a grinding rally to overtake BRONZE WARRIOR in deep stretch and kept to task in the final
stages. BRONZE WARRIOR tracked the moderate early pace, raced in pursuit of HUNTERS GHOST to the half-mile marker, confronted that rival nearing
the quarter pole, battled to mid-stretch, took a narrow lead nearing the furlong marker, was outkicked in the final stages by SUNNY SPOT and held for
second. HUNTERS GHOST showed early speed and was sent to the early lead, cleared the field into the first turn and set moderate fractions to the second
turn, came under pressure from BRONZE WARRIOR nearing the quarter marker, battled with that rival to mid-stretch, could not match strides with SUNNY
SPOT in deep stretch and held safely for third in the end. WALKING BOSS was unhurried early on, made a steady advance into the second turn, swung
widest for the drive and closed willingly in the final stages. MAGIC TIGER settled off of the early pace while in the second flight, raced three wide along the
first turn, mounted a three then four wide bid nearing the top of the lane, could not sustain that bid in the drive and flattened. MORE POWER TO HIM was
allowed to settle, raced three wide along the first turn, maintained position to the second turn, swung five wide for the drive, lost ground in upper stretch and
improved position in the final stages. GORDY'S BOY was forwardly placed in the early stages, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, lost
ground two wide on the second turn, could not keep pace in upper stretch and weakened in the drive. POUR ON THE COLE was unhurried, raced two wide
along the far turn and lacked a late rally. TWIRLING DERBY settled off of the early pace, lost position on the far turn and was not a factor.

Footnotes
ARMOUR PLATE was unhurried in the early stages, saved ground to the top of the lane, made a quick move in upper stretch, split foes nearing the furlong
marker, confronted ROYAL JESTER in deep stretch, battled against that foe and made a late surge in the final strides to prevail. ROYAL JESTER tracked
the quick early pace from the second flight, raced two wide to the quarter marker, loomed in upper stretch, assumed command inside of the furlong marker,
met the late bid of ARMOUR PLATE in deep stretch and was just edged in the final strides for the win and was second best. GOVERNOR ARTHUR settled
off of the early fractions, raced three wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive, advanced in upper stretch, closed fast in deep stretch and was clear for
third in the final stages. MARQUE IT UP broke alertly and took back off of the quick early pace, tracked the speed four wide on the turn, chased to
mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. RHODIUM RUNNER was forwardly placed in the early going, tracked the quick pace from the inside to the quarter
marker, advanced in upper stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong grounds and flattened in the late stages. EL CHARRO CHAMP chased the rapid
pace while outside of rivals, came five wide into the drive and did not produce a late response. UNUSUAL CODE lagged in the early stages, trailed to the
top of the lane and was not a factor. INTO BOURBON was hustled to the early lead, set fast fractions while prompted to the quarter marker, shook free from
the pressing rival in upper stretch, was confronted by ROYAL JESTER nearing the furlong grounds, could not hold off that rival and faded in the late stages.
POLACCO showed early speed and prompted the quick early fractions, could not keep pace in upper stretch and tired in the drive.

RACHEL'S COACH engaged with DR LOW KEY in the early stages and pressed that rival to the turn, dueled through quick fractions to the quarter marker,
battled to mid-stretch, shook free inside of the furlong marker and held sway in the late stages. J D'S RUDE BOY was allowed to settle, improved position
two wide on the turn, made a steady bid into upper stretch, could not reel in the winner in the late stages but finished well and was second best in the end.
DR LOW KEY broke alertly and established the early lead, was pressed to the turn by RACHEL'S COACH then dueled with that rival through quick fractions
to the quarter marker, battled to mid-stretch, weakened in the final stages and just held on for third. BOY CHARLEMAGNE lacked early speed, advanced
two wide on the turn, swung three wide for the drive, closed willingly in the drive and just missed for third. CURVY CURLS tracked the quick pace from the
second flight, raced two wide to the quarter marker and lacked a late rally. GUNNIN FOR GOLD was away a step slowly, rushed up to be prominent into the
turn, pressed the quick pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and faded. NO ICE NO GLASS chased from towards the rear, raced three
wide along the turn, swung four wide for the drive and did not threaten. RAYS REGAL lacked early speed, trailed to the top of the lane, was not able to
threaten in the final stages but did show good late interest. G'S LAST CHANCE showed early speed and chased the quick pace to the turn, dropped back
nearing the quarter marker and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
MAGICAL LADY settled off of the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, continued a steady bid in upper stretch while four wide, made a grinding
advance inside of the furlong marker while on the left lead, came within aim of the leaders in deep stretch and was up in the final strides to prevail. MISS
ARROWHEAD tracked the moderate early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, came within aim of JAYCEE nearing mid-stretch, confronted that game
foe inside of the furlong marker, battled with that rival and took a narrow lead to deep stretch, was confronted by MAGICAL LADY in the final strides and
was nipped on the line for the win, while just holding for second. JAYCEE broke alertly and established the early lead, set moderate fractions to the quarter
marker, held foes at bay to mid-stretch, was confronted by MISS ARROWHEAD inside of the furlong marker, met that bid to deep stretch, gamely battled in
the final stages against the top pair and was bested in the final strides, while clear for third in the end. CLOCHARD STREET chased the early pace, came
four wide on the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final stages. TROPICANA GIRL tracked the early pace, saved ground while close
up on the turn, chased to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. NAN ELIZABETH chased from towards the rear, raced three wide on the turn, swung five wide
for the drive and improved position in the final stages. ARISTEIA settled in the second flight, came two wide to the quarter marker and finished evenly in the
drive. BIG CHICK was allowed to settle, improved position two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive and offered a mild late rally. DANGEROUS
ILLUSION settled in the second flight, saved ground to the top of the lane and did not threaten. STEIN'S GIRL lacked early speed, raced three wide along
the turn, swung six wide at the top of the lane and lacked a late rally. PULPIT SINGER showed early speed and was forwardly placed into the turn, stalked
the pace to the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
LIL MIRACLE MAN broke alertly and was sent to the early lead, set moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the
quarter marker, repelled JOHNNY DAR in upper stretch, drew clear to mid-stretch and pulled away in the final stages. YOU KIDDING ME settled in the
second flight, raced two wide along the far turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, finished well and was up for second in the final strides. JOHNNY DAR was
forwardly placed in the early stages, stalked the moderate fractions through the backstretch run, confronted the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, was
turned away in that effort, chased LIL MIRACLE MAN to mid-stretch and was outfinished in the final sixteenth, while just holding for third. GABBY HAYES
stumbled leaving the break and was away a step slowly, was allowed to settle in the early stages, advanced nearing the second turn, raced four wide to the
quarter marker, ran evenly to mid-stretch, made a mild late bid and just missed for the minor awards. NIGHT PROOF tracked the early pace, raced three
wide into the backstretch run, maintained position while two wide on the second turn and was outkicked in the drive. RIO KING stumbled at the start and
was off a step slowly, was allowed to settle, raced three wide into the second turn, swung four wide for the drive, improved position inside of the furlong
marker and challenged for third in deep stretch. BEROLIJEAN (FR) lacked early speed, raced two wide along the second turn, improved position in upper
stretch but did not threaten. TALISKER BAY lacked early speed and was not a factor. AUSPICIOUS STYLE stalked the early pace while outside of rivals,
raced four wide into the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the second turn, was outrun in upper stretch and faded in the final furlong. MIDNIGHT
METAL was prominent on the run into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace through the backstretch run, saved ground to the top of the lane and gave
way in the drive.

NEVER FOR MONEY took back off of the fast early pace, advanced on the turn to stalk the pacesetter to the quarter marker, overtook
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER leaving the turn, drew clear nearing mid-stretch and was ridden out under a hand ride in the final stages. GETTIN SIDEWAYS
lacked early speed, raced three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive, finished well in the final furlong, was no match for the winner in deep
stretch but kept to task in the end to secure second. TIGER QUEEN tracked the quick early pace, raced two wide along the turn, gained ground in upper
stretch, came within aim nearing the furlong marker, could not keep pace with NEVER FOR MONEY in the late stages, was edged for second in deep
stretch and held for third. MARILYN'S SMILE was allowed to settle, advanced along the rail leaving the turn, could not sustain that bid in the drive and
missed for third. PERSUASIVE LIPS was unhurried in the early stages, raced two wide along the turn, swung four wide for the drive, came in tight in upper
stretch, found room late and improved position in the final sixteenth. KITTY'S CANDY settled off of the fast early pace, made a steady bid along the turn and
into upper stretch but did not offer a final response. WARM SUMMER stalked the pace to the turn, advanced three wide nearing the quarter marker, lost
position in upper stretch and gave way. DRESS REHEARSAL chased the fast early pace, lost ground along the inside on the turn and weakened.
REDSTWIRLINGDANCER was hustled after an alert beginning and sped to the early lead, set fast fractions to the quarter marker, was overtaken by
NEVER FOR MONEY in upper stretch and faded in the final stages. DAMN THE TORPEDOES hopped at the start and was away a step slowly, chased
from the second flight to the turn, advanced four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that run in the drive and tired.

Footnotes
ROYAL 'N RANDO settled off of the early pace, was well placed through the backstretch run, was steered four wide along the second turn to follow KINGS
RIVER KNIGHT, chased that rival to mid-stretch, overtook the runner-up inside of the furlong marker and determinedly held that one at bay in the final
stages. KINGS RIVER KNIGHT settled off of the early pace while not far back, raced three wide along the first turn then was steered outside of rivals along
the backstretch run, advanced four wide on the second turn, assumed command in upper stretch, was overtaken by ROYAL 'N RANDO inside of the furlong
marker and was second best in the end. SECRET CLUB was unhurried in the early going, improved position two wide on the second turn, swung four wide
for the drive, was no match for the top pair in the drive but ran on in the final sixteenth to secure third. HOUSE OF LORDS was allowed to settle, saved all of
the ground to the second turn, encountered traffic in upper stretch, found room in the final furlong and lacked a late kick. J T'S WATCH bobbled at the start
and was away a step slowly, settled in the midflight while not far back, saved ground to the second turn, came in tight nearing the quarter marker, was
outrun in upper stretch and lacked a late response. ANITANEWMERCEDES was hard sent to be prominent in the early stages, stalked the moderate pace
through the backstretch run, vied for the lead nearing the quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and was empty in the drive. SHOTGUN EXPRESS
(IRE) was forwardly placed and tracked the moderate early fractions, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the far turn, lost
ground in upper stretch and tired in the final stages. DERECHO DANDY was asked for early speed and established the early lead along the first turn, set
moderate fractions through the backstretch run, came under pressure nearing the quarter marker, stopped in upper stretch, was eased through the lane and
walked off under his own power.

Footnotes
TIZ AN EDVENTURE allowed to settle from the break, was always travelling comfortably in the early stages, stayed in the clear to the far turn, started a bid
with three furlongs to run, responded when called upon at the head of the stretch and powered to the wire to win going away. NATURAL COLOUR (GB)
taken in hand and raced mid-pack through the early stages, started to creep forward passing the five-furlong pole, waited for running room from the
seven-sixteenths pole to the head of the stretch, ducked to the inside near the eighth pole and finished well up the rail to gain the place.
CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE was squeezed after the break and fell back to last early, saved ground while remaining at the rear of the field into the far turn,
moved out into the two-path to start a sustained bid from the three-furlong pole, found clear running turning for home and closed stoutly to gain third.
SHEZAGHOST got a clean break and hustled to take command early, led the field down the backstretch while getting some pressure from NORTHWEST
FACTOR to her outside, was set down with three furlongs to go, battled gamely down the stretch and weakened just a bit in sight of the wire. NORTHWEST
FACTOR broke well and was able to angle over from the outside, pressed SHEZAGHOST from the seven-eighths, moved to challenge that rival passing the
quarter pole but was unable to pass that one and weakened in the late stages. LA VIKINA veered in a couple strides out of the gate, causing NATURAL
COULOUR (GB) to shift into COWBOY'S DAUGHTER's path which in turn forced CLOCKSTRIKESTWELVE to have to take up, used the opened space to
seize the rail for the run into the first turn, shifted out for the run down the backstretch, had no room to run through the turn, found a path on the rail as the
field turned for home and finished with some interest but needed more. SUGAR FIX was not asked for speed leaving the gate, raced with the forward group
while under moderate restraint, got jostled a bit then was let run from the half mile pole and looked to be a threat but was unable to sustain the bid. STRIKE
AT DAWN bothered some by the chain reaction to the outside, lacked early speed, moved off the rail in the first turn, raced near the rear but clear of traffic
down the backstretch, angled back over to the rail into the far turn, was hard ridden from the seven-sixteenths pole but was unable to make up any ground.
COWBOYS DAUGHTER was bumped at the start as part of the chain reaction started by LA VIKINA, saved ground but stayed towards the rear of the field
to the far and was never a factor while being outrun. TARANTA (IRE) gained a forward position early while four wide through the first turn, was within
striking distance of the early leaders to the far turn, then was passed by horses despite the best efforts of the rider and fell back through the field and was
outrun from that point.

PAPA TIGER stumbled at the break but recovered quickly and sped away from the gate opening a clear lead on the field, maintained a clear lead while
setting quick fractions through the turn, responded when roused at the head of the stretch and held the closing runner-up at bay in the final stages. IDIOT'S
GOLD broke alertly and grabbed the inside position of a trio chasing the lone pacesetter, moved closer through the turn, launched a serious bid from the
quarter pole and finished well but was unable to collar the winner. ACCLIDER came away from the gate a bit awkwardly and spotted the field several
lengths at the start, got boxed in through the turn and steadied in traffic near the five-sixteenths pole, swung four-wide into the stretch found some clear
running down the lane and was rapidly gaining ground at the wire. IMPRESSIVE CURLS got away well from the gate, contested the early pace for a furlong
then settled into a stalking position, was asked to go after the leader from the three-furlong marker, entered the stretch with some momentum but failed to
change leads and tired with a furlong to go. GALLAND DE BESOS fell well behind the pace from the start, chased the field into the turn, awaited room
behind a wall of horses, swung five-wide into the stretch, then angled out even further, bothering a tiring WAY TO HOT and once clear found his best stride
but had too much ground to make up. HAVAKASH READY showed good speed from the break, tracked the pacesetter on the outside of a group of three,
loomed a threat turning for home but ran out of steam in mid-stretch. VINNIEBOB was away in good order, raced mid-pack to the turn, was asked for more
three furlongs from home and made a brief move forward but could not sustain it and was done by mid-stretch. TIGERAD broke slowly, then fought the rider
a bit falling well behind the field, moved to the rail through the turn and summoned enough of a late run to pass a few down the lane. SIXTYFOUR G T O
outrun early, fell to the rear of the field before the turn, came under a hard ride from the five-sixteenths pole, swung out seven-wide into the stretch, steadied
in mid-stretch when WAY TO HOT swerved to avoid GALLAND DE BESOS and was ridden out to the wire. SHANAGOLDEN was outrun from the start, was
asked to keep up, steadied off of the swerving GALLAND DE BESOS and was never a factor. WAY TOO HOT close up after a furlong, was losing ground
going into the turn, swung six-wide into the stretch, had to steady when GALLAND DE BESOS swerved into his path and could not recover. ARTISTIC
SERVE was hard ridden from the break angled to the rail and was under constant handling through the turn, tired passing the quarter pole and was not
persevered with late.
