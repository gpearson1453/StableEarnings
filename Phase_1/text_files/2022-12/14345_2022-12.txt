Footnotes
THEJIGISUP raced off the pace on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and kicked clear
in the lane. RISK VS REWARD chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the three path, challenged
entering the stretch, was carried out when IMPERIAL BIRD drifted into his lane and kept on to the wire. IMPERIAL BIRD led the way up the backstretch,
raced in the two path around the turn, dueled in upper stretch, and finished evenly while drifting out through the final furlong. COMPASS CAY raced in the
middle of the pack on the inside in the early going, came around the turn in the two path and finished evenly while never threatening. EXCELLENT MARK
trailed the field up the backstretch, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch and showed no kick. TEDDY'S HONOR raced off the
pace on the outside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the two path and made no bid.

Footnotes
STYLE hit the gate leaving it, dropped back to trail far behind the field racing up the backstretch, began a bold bid from the two path coming around the turn
and gained ground quickly in the stretch to kick clear. MACHTENHAIRONFIRE chased the leaders between horses through the opening quarter of a mile,
raced in the four path around the turn and kept on to the wire. I'M A CUTIE dueled on the outside up the backstretch, inched clear while saving ground
around the turn, led the field into the homestretch and was caught late. GLITTER BAY raced off the pace on the inside in the early going, navigated the turn
from the two path and gained ground mildly in the lane. BARBARA dueled on the inside up the backstretch, gave way while racing in the three path around
the turn and was outkicked in the stretch. PRETTY DEVIL raced in the middle of the pack in the opening stages, dropped back while saving ground around
the turn and was empty from there. DAHGO raced off the pace on the outside early, angled in to save ground around the turn and made no bid.

Footnotes
ROUNDABOUT saved ground around the first turn, tracked the leader on the inside up the backstretch, continued to save ground around the second bend,
began a bid approaching the quarter pole, pulled clear and held that margin to the finish. SYLLABUS raced off the pace on the outside around the first turn
and up the backstretch, navigated the far turn still in the two path and gained ground on the outside late. SHEMIGHTDANCESALSA bumped with the horse
to her inside leaving the gate, saved ground around the first turn, chased the leader up the backstretch, moved up to challenge from the three path headed
around the second bend, dueled in upper stretch and gave way in the final sixteenth of a mile. LIZQUEENFLUERDELIS bumped with the horses to either
side and was squeezed back leaving the gate, trailed the field on the inside through the opening half mile, began to move up coming around the far turn,
veered out the seven path entering the stretch and continued to improve position from there. SHES SKY HIGH raced in the three path around the first turn,
stalked the leader on the outside up the backstretch, continued around the far turn still in the three path and finished evenly. BYZANTINE EMPIRE led the
way from the two path around the first turn and up the backstretch, dueled on the inside racing around the second bend and faded in the final furlong.
MORENA DANCER raced at the back of the pack on the outside through the opening half mile, came around the far turn in the three path, bumped with
HURRY UP DEAR near the quarter pole and never threatened. DON DIVA bumped lightly with the horse to her outside at the start, saved ground around
the first turn, settled off the pace on the inside for the run up the backstretch, lost ground on the field while racing on the rail around the far turn and was not
a factor. HURRY UP DEAR raced in the two path around the first turn, continued up the backstretch in the middle of the pack, bumped with MORENA
DANCER and stumbled approaching the quarter pole, lost her rider, was caught by outriders after the wire and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS
MADE INTO THE INCIDENT AT THE QUARTER POLE. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
