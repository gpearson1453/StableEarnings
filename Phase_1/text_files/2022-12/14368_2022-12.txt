Footnotes
SWAN LAKE vied for the lead from the three path around the first turn, took control of the pace along the inside down the backstretch, was cued to open up
turning into the lane, responded well and held sway. COMMANDER FLYNN tracked in the three path, was roused from the four path around the far turn,
took aim from the three path turning into the lane, and chased home the winner to place. CHACHARERO trailed from the three path around the first turn,
shifted out to the five path and moved up down the backstretch, was coaxed around the far turn, and kept on in the stretch to get up for show. SPY TOWN
was fractious in the gate, raced from off the pace in the three path, was ridden between rivals entering the lane, but finished evenly. ARTICO was unhurried
along the inside early, was driven along while swing out to the four path at the top of the lane, but drifted in passing the eighth pole and was one paced.
COLLISION rated in the three path early, floated out to the six path into the lane, but was empty. REMEMBER SON broke out and bumped an outer rival at
the start, was rank from the two path into the first turn, prompted the pace from said position, but gaveway turning into the stretch, and was vanned off.

Footnotes
GILLIGAN set a clear pace in the two path and held clear under a drive. CHIQUIRIN raced off the pace two wide, angled to the rail near the quarter pole and
rallied inside. STRASBOURG was reluctant to load, raced off the pace three wide and was along for the show. HIDDEN WARRIOR chased the pace inside,
tipped two wide near the quarter pole and lacked a closing bid. FISHING FOR FUN prompted the winner in the three path and retreated under minimal
stretch urging. CONGRATS AGAIN was sluggish early, raced four wide around the turn and never threatened. CATCHING MAGIC was outrun inside.

Footnotes
TRUCE OF GOD prompted the pace in the four path, bid three wide around the turn, took over and was cued to open up from the four path entering the
stretch, and was much the best. CATATUMBO LIGHTNIN set the pace from inside, was coaxed and lost the lead while cutting the corner into the lane, and
held on to place. SEAX broke out and bumped an outer foe, raced from off the pace in two path, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, and finished
evenly to show. ANTILLEAN broke out and was bumped between rivals at the start, rated in the four path, tucked in around the turn and was driven from the
two path into the lane, and improved position. MOUSEFAST broke in and bumped an inner foe leaving the gate, pressed in the three path, was roused
between rivals around the turn, but yielded turning into the stretch. GO GREEN chased in the four path, was hustled from the six path into the stretch, but
was empty. GO GO GREEN was bumped between rivals at the start and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
KIZZY broke awkwardly, raced off the early pace while racing three wide, tucked in two wide late on the first turn, advanced two wide between foes around
the far turn, tipped out in upper stretch, kicked in and was up late. FRENCH FRANC (FR) set a pressured pace inside, shook clear in upper stretch and led
until deep stretch. STELLARATOR saved ground off the early pace, went three wide around the far turn, swung wider in upper stretch and ran on for the
show. TRUE BLUE PEARL was off a step slow, raced off the pace two and three wide and rallied belatedly. STRONG EMBRACE prompted the pace three
wide, reached near even terms around the far turn but weakened in the lane. LUNA ANTONIA was in range while racing two and three wide and faded in
the stretch. SOUPER DUPER READY bumped with TAKE THE PODIUM at the start, chased the pace inside and lacked a closing bid. TAKE THE PODIUM
was bumped at the start, saved ground well back, swung out in the stretch and never threatened. DUBSTEP pressed the pace two wide between foes and
retreated through the stretch. UKIYO was rated back soon after the start, angled four wide nearing the first turn and stayed wide while making little impact.

Footnotes
CONCRETE GLORY set the pace from inside, was cued to open up from the two path turning into the lane, responded well and was much the best.
CACTUS JACK hopped at the start, pressed the pace from two wide, was roused into the turn, floated out to the four path into the stretch, and ran on but
was second best. SIXTY ONE tracked in the four path, was coaxed while shifting inwards to the rail into the turn, cut the corner turning into the lane, and
finished evenly for show. UNCAPTURED KING trailed from the two path into the turn, was ridden from the five path into the stretch, but never factored.
EXAMINER had an awkward start, chased in the four path, swung out to the eight path turning into the lane, but never threatened. VINNIE VAN GO stalked
from the three path, drifted out to the seven path going into the stretch, but was empty.

Footnotes
FAVOR vied for the lead under coaxing along the inside early, was driven along when headed by BLUEFIELD midway around the turn, rebroke from the two
path at the top of the lane, and edged clear. BLUEFIELD stalked behind the leading duo in the three path, moved up to bid from three wide around the turn,
sustained that bid and was driven from the five path into the stretch, but was repelled approaching the eighth pole to finish with place honors. STARSHIP
NALA rated in the four path, was roused around the turn, tipped out to the five path entering the lane, but evened out in the final furlong, and just held on to
show. EASY COME EASY GO trailed from the three path and was hustled into the turn, swung out to the seven path turning into the stretch, and passed a
pair of tiring rivals. SONAR chased in the two path but flattened down the lane. QUINOA TIFAH vied for the lead from the four path, pressed the eventual
winner from two wide into the turn, but gaveway entering the stretch.

off the pace, tipped out in upper stretch and rallied between foes to gain the show. OGLALA raced well back three and four wide and rallied belatedly.
TAMARINDO lacked early speed while racing two wide, inched closer three wide around the far turn, swung widest in upper stretch and rallied belatedly.
KHOSEA failed to menace while racing two and three wide. SPEED SALSA played no factor while racing three and four wide. BRITTIZ pressed the pace
two wide, took the lead nearing the quarter pole and tired in the final furlong. MILES OF SMILES was outrun while racing two wide. BRAVO ZULU set the
pace along the rail and retreated through the lane. ROUGH ENOUGH chased the pace two and three wide and came up empty in the lane. LITTLE BELITA

from the two path into the turn, swung out to the seven path into the stretch, but was no factor. MISS MCBRIDE chased along the inside but never
