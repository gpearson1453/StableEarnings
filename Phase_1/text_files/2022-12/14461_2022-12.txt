Footnotes
JAYJAYDEE set a pressured pace on the inside, then turned back the bid by the quarter pole and shook clear leaving the turn, then remained clear to prove
best under a drive. SIR ROCKPORT was rated along early, saved ground on the turn, swung out four wide leaving the turn and made a bid, but could no
gain on the winner while being second best. ROCKET BLAST tracked the pace three to four wide and had, angled out leaving the furlong marker and had
no kick while on the left lead. BAILEY pressed the winner early and made a three wide bid on the turn to duel for command by the quarter pole but faded in
the drive. KING'S HOUSE lacked a rally. The rider on ROCKET BLAST filed a OBJECTION for interference leaving the turn, after the STEWARDS reviewed
the replays the race was left as is.

Footnotes
MEMPHIS MAFIA was reserved early on the inside, eased off the inside on the turn, circled the field six wide leaving the turn and closed well on the outside
to get up late under a drive. SHATTER ME stalked the pace and made a four wide bid leaving the quarter pole, kept gaining late but was outfinished by the
winner while getting up for the place award. STARSHIP REINA pressed the early pace and made a three wide bid on the turn and drew clear leaving the
turn, but proved to be not enough as caught late and losing the place award on the wire. BRITESIDEOFTHEROAD chased the pace and saved ground on
the inside and offered a mild late rally. RAECHEL'S RISK was settled early and was five wide on the turn and lacked the needed rally. NORA RADD set the
early pace on the inside while in the two path, then weakened in the drive. POLISHED GAL lacked a solid rally.

HERE'S WALDO was away alertly to set the pace on the inside, was well handled and kicked clear leaving the turn and then kicked away late to prove best
under right handed crop urging. DEB'S GUNFIGHTER was rated along early and saved ground throughout, finished well on the inside to gain the place
award. KAZ SUGAR BANK prompted the winner three wide, made a bid on the backstretch and on the turn but could not get to the winner and lost the palce
award late. ECONOMIC POWER stalked the pace moving to the outside on the first turn, made a four wide bid on the turn but hung in the lane. MUCHO
MACHO EDDIE chased the pace three wide and weakened. AWESOME LAUNCH was five wide on both turns and had no rally. COMBATING was fractious
in the post parade, failed to menace. BLUEBERRY MASH was not a factor. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

RUN LAURA RUN broke outwardly at the start, set a pressured pace early in the two path, then drew clear on the turn and by the furlong marker, then held
sway late under left handed crop urging. SHOYYOOKH stalked the pace and was three wide on the turn, came four wide into the lane and rallied well late to
just miss. SAKARI pressed the early pace on the inside, then rated off the pace on the turn, angled out when leaving the turn and was slowly gaining late
but needed more. SHASHKA chased the pace three wide and weakened. BO RUNKLE chased the pace four wide on the turn and came five wide into the
lane and had no response. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.

was reserved early, advanced two wide on the turn, then finished well in the lane gaining th place award on the wire. KAZ PALACE was bumped leaving the
five eighths, then was rated to settle into stride and drop to the inside, advanced on the rail on the turn, tipped out four wide leaving the turn and making a
bid, raced erratic and then steadied at the sixteenth pole and hung late, lost place award on the wire. SLIPPERY WHEN WET was reserved early, advanced
three to four wide on the turn but had no late kick. UPSTATE AND BACK passed the tiring rivals. LORD UHTRED was allowed to settle on the inside and
had no response. NEON SIGN prompted the pace three wide and weakened. BRENTFORD stalked the pace four wide and stopped. The rider on KAZ

Footnotes
SEA PINES showed good speed two wide, then drew clear on the turn and then drew out in the lane under mild pressure to prove much the best.
HIGHWAY QUEEN was settled early on the inside, advanced on the turn on the inside, angled off the inside leaving the turn three wide and chased the
winner home to be clearly second best. LADY BERNADETTE chased the early pace and made a mild bid four wide on the turn but flattened out, bested
rest. LOOP THE LOOP was reserved early, angled out in the lane and had a belated rally on the outside for the minor rewards. CAPE COD SALLY tracked
the pace on the inside and weakened. LIL H failed to menace. SCARLET LILY pressed the winner early on the inside, then was two wide on the turn and in
between rivals by the quarter pole and weakened. FALL CAMPAIGN broke in the air and was not a factor.

Footnotes
MAGICALLYDELICIOUS was allowed to settle early, saved ground on the turn, angled out leaving the three sixteenths and closed well to get up in time,
driving. HIPNOTIZADA was away alertly to set a pressured pace on the inside, shook clear leaving the turn but was not enough as was caught late.
SLEEPY N JOYFUL was allowed to settle early, came five wide into the lane and had no kick while besting the rest. SUSIKIN pressed the pace three wide
and came four wide into the lane and weakened in the lane. LIMONATA lacked a rally. TIMES CHANGED FOLLOWING REVIEW.
