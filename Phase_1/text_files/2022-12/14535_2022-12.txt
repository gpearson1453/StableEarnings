Footnotes
REMEMBER SUE stalked the early pace from the inside, advanced nearing the second turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker, came within aim in upper
stretch, battled with MISS FLAWLESS in mid-stretch, shook free from that rival, kept to task in deep stretch and held on over the oncoming runner-up. MISS
EVER READY allowed to settle, was roused three wide on the second turn, mounted a four wide bid in upper stretch, closed well in the final sixteenth, came
within aim of REMEMBER SUE in deep stretch and just missed for the win, while besting the rest. MISS FLAWLESS (FR) forwardly placed into the first turn,
attended to the moderate pace to the half-mile marker, overtook the pacesetter nearing the quarter pole and took command nearing the top of the lane,
battled with REMEMBER SUE inside of the furlong grounds, could not keep pace in deep stretch and held safely for third in the end. FOCUS FIRST rated
off of the moderate early pace, advanced along the inside on the second turn, continued that bid approaching mid-stretch and was outkicked in the final
stages. BENSON assumed command in the early stages, set moderate fractions while well rated through the backstretch run, was overtaken nearing the
quarter marker, chased to mid-stretch and tired. CLASS CODE three wide into the first turn, stalked the moderate fractions to the second turn, dropped back
nearing the top of the lane and gave way.

Footnotes
TIZ A TIGER pressed the solid early pace to the turn, maintained position while vying for the lead nearing the quarter marker, took a narrow lead in upper
stretch, battled with KIND BUT SHE LIES in the drive and determinedly held sway in the final sixteenth. LADY BLACKBIRD broke out at the start and was
off a step slowly, advanced three wide on the turn, mounted a four wide rally leaving the turn, closed with a rush in deep stretch, could not reel in TIZ A
TIGER in the final stages and was up for place in the final strides. KIND BUT SHE LIES broke alertly and established the early lead, set solid contested
fractions to the quarter marker, battled with TIZ A TIGER leaving the turn, stubbornly yielded in the final stages and was just edged for second while holding
for third in a blanket finish for the minor awards. CLUBHOUSE WAVE forwardly placed in the early going, came in tight nearing the turn, ran between horses
while close to the pace nearing the quarter marker, slipped to the inside for the drive, was outkicked in the final sixteenth and just missed for the minor
awards. DADDYS NINA tracked the quick early pace, made a three wide move nearing the quarter marker, lost ground in upper stretch and weakened.
LASSAROCK was a bit slow into stride early on, improved position three wide on the turn, was gaining in the stretch run but needed more in the final
stages. CONNIE'S PROMISE broke in at the start and was away a step slowly, contested the early pace, came in tight nearing the turn, was shuffled back
leaving the three-furlong marker, gave way nearing the top of the lane and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
HUNTERS GHOST broke a step slowly and was allowed to settle in the early going, advanced four wide on the turn, swung five wide for the drive, closed
with a rush in the final furlong, overtook MARQUE IT UP inside of the sixteenth-marker and drew clear in the final strides. MARQUE IT UP broke alertly and
showed good early speed, set quick fractions to the quarter marker, spurted clear nearing the furlong marker, raced on the left lead in deep stretch, could
not hold off HUNTERS GHOST inside of the sixteenth-marker and held for place in the final strides. CONTINENTAL UNION tracked the quick early
fractions, raced two wide along the turn, lost ground in upper stretch, rallied in the final stages and held safely for third, while just missing for second.
HARBOR KITTY chased the quick early fractions, saved ground along the turn, ran in pursuit to mid-stretch and lacked a late rally. THAT'S BIND BABE
stalked the quick early pace, advanced four wide on the turn, lost position in upper stretch and finished evenly in the final furlong. RHODIUM RUNNER
chased the quick early pace, raced three wide along the turn, swung five wide for the drive and offered a mild late rally. GENTLEMAN'S SECRET showed
early speed and was forwardly placed heading to the turn, advanced two wide nearing the quarter marker, chased MARQUE IT UP to mid-stretch and
weakened in the final stages. EL CHARRO CHAMP stalked the early pace, advanced three wide on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and gave way.
EMERALD MAGIC lacked early speed, saved ground along the turn while trailing and was not a late factor.

Footnotes
MY DOMINATOR was allowed to settle in the early going, saved ground on the turn while advancing, tipped out in upper stretch, loomed nearing the furlong
marker, assumed command inside of the furlong pole and kept to task in the late stages. ARMOUR PLATE took back off of the quick early pace, advanced
two wide on the turn, continued that bid into upper stretch, shifted outside of rivals inside of the furlong marker, could not reel in the winner in the late stages
and finished well to secure second. AFFECTIONTO AUTISM was forwardly placed in the early stages, came under a snug hold and had the bridle slip
nearing the turn while close up, raced three wide to the quarter marker, advanced to vie for the lead in mid-stretch, could not keep pace with MY
DOMINATOR in the final stages and held for show. ROYAL JESTER chased the quick early pace, saved ground along the turn, rallied in upper stretch and
finished evenly in the final sixteenth. EXCESSIVE CAT broke alertly and showed good early speed, set quick fractions while pressed to the quarter marker,
battled to the furlong marker and weakened in the late stages. TIZ VICIOUS lacked early speed, mounted a three wide on the turn, rallied four wide in upper
stretch, was gaining in the late stages but lacked the needed late response. LYING GHOST chased the quick early pace, lost position while two wide on the
turn and weakened in the drive. QUIET CHARM was hustled in the early stages and pressed the solid early pace, kept pressure on the pacesetter to the
quarter marker, dropped back in upper stretch and tired.

Footnotes
PATSY MONTANA tracked the moderate early pace from the second flight, saved ground to the quarter marker, rallied in upper stretch, switched leads
nearing the sixteenth-marker, made a late surge in deep stretch to reel in ABOVE THE STARS and was up in the final strides to prevail. ABOVE THE
STARS broke alertly and showed good early speed, set moderate fractions to the quarter marker, drew clear nearing the furlong pole, was all out in deep
stretch to hold off PATSY MONTANA and was nailed on the wire for the win, while holding safely for second. DALLAS ALICE tracked the early pace,
advanced nearing the quarter marker, chased ABOVE THE STARS to mid-stretch, finished well in deep stretch, could not match strides with PATSY
MONTANA in the final stages and held safely in the end for third. PRETTY THIRSTY stalked the early pace, mounted a four wide bid on the turn, found her
best stride in the final furlong but lacked the needed late response. NIGHT CRUISER lacked early speed, improved position three wide on the turn,
continued that advance to mid-stretch and passed tiring rivals in the final furlong. PURPLE NIGHT chased the pace from the second flight, advanced three
wide on the turn, lost position nearing the furlong pole and gave way. THIRSTY DATE bobbled at the start and was off a step slowly, chased the pace to the
turn, raced two wide to the quarter marker and weakened. ITS MY PARTY had her head turned at the start and was away slowly, trailed to the quarter
marker and was not a late threat. I'M GONNA SHINE lacked early speed, saved ground to the quarter marker and did not factor. FREED BY MAGIC
showed early speed and stalked the pace to the turn, dropped back while three wide nearing the quarter marker and tired.

Footnotes
BIG SPIN rated off of the early pace, saved ground along the first turn, came in tight and waited for racing room nearing the quarter marker, navigated traffic
in the stretch run while advancing, made a late surge along the rail in the final sixteenth and kept to task to prevail. GABBY HAYES was away a step slowly
and was unhurried, raced three wide into the backstretch run, advanced three wide on the second turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, closed
well in the final furlong, vied for the lead in deep stretch, was outclosed by BIG SPIN in the final strides and kept on to secure second. ZIPPY BABY showed
early speed and prompted the moderate pace to the second turn, challenged the pacesetter nearing the quarter marker, assumed command leaving the
second turn, was set down for the drive, held foes at bay to deep stretch, was outfinished by the top pair and held safely in the end for third. YOU KIDDING
ME allowed to settle, raced three wide into the backstretch run, swung widest for the drive, ran evenly to mid-stretch and found her best stride late. LOOKIN
TO EXCEL was forwardly placed into the first turn, tracked the moderate pace between rivals to the second turn, raced evenly to mid-stretch, came in tight
and encountered traffic in the final furlong and finished evenly in the final sixteenth. ASANO'S BACK tracked the early pace, raced three wide along the first
turn, maintained position through the backstretch run, improved position three wide on the second turn, could not keep pace in the drive and was outkicked
in the final stages. SPROSTON tracked the moderate fractions from the inside, lost position on the second turn and gave way in the drive. JOHNNY DAR

Footnotes
LUCKY LAD broke alertly and established the early lead, set fast pressured fractions to the quarter marker, shook free from the pressing rival in upper
stretch, was challenged late by IDIOT'S GOLD, kept to task under firm left-handed urging in the final strides and held on for the win. IDIOT'S GOLD stalked
the rapid early pace, raced two wide along the turn, ran evenly to mid-stretch, closed well inside of the furlong marker to challenge LUCKY LAD, could not
reel in the winner in the final stages and was second best. DAD BOD chased the solid early pace, advanced along the rail on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch, was outkicked in the final stages and held safely in the end for third. IMPRESSIVE CURLS raced in the second flight in the early going, came
three wide to the quarter marker, swung four wide for the drive, passed tiring rivals in the final furlong and mounted a mild late rally. GALLAND DE BESOS
was forwardly placed in the early stages, pressed the solid pace to the quarter marker, lost ground to LUCKY LAD in upper stretch, chased that rival to the
furlong marker and weakened in the final stages. TIGERAD was crowded by THE SANDY SURPRISE leaving the start and was off a step slowly, chased
from the inside on the turn, improved position in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. TALBOT BAY chased the quick early pace, raced outside of rivals on
the turn and lacked a late response. THE SANDY SURPRISE crowded TIGERAD leaving the break and was off a step slowly, chased the solid early pace
to the turn, lost position while two wide nearing the quarter marker and did not threaten. WAKES AND WEDDINGS ducked out leaving the break, spotted
the field several lengths in the early stages and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
LONG LANCE settled off of the quick early pace, raced two wide along the turn, mounted a four wide rally in upper stretch, responding to steady urging in
the drive, closed determinedly in deep stretch to overtake HEAVENLY PRINCE and kept to task in the final strides to prevail. HEAVENLY PRINCE tracked
the quick early pace to the turn, raced three wide to the quarter marker, advanced in upper stretch, battled with TOOK CHARGE to mid-stretch, took a
narrow lead nearing the sixteenth-marker, could not hold off a determined LONG LANCE in deep stretch and bested the rest. TOOK CHARGE broke alertly
and showed good early speed to dictate terms to the turn, set quick fractions to the quarter marker, battled with HEAVENLY PRINCE while holding foes at
bay to mid-stretch, could not keep pace in the final sixteenth and just held on for third in the final strides. RAGER lacked early speed, saved ground along
the turn, came in tight and waited for racing room leaving the quarter marker, improved position in the drive, closed willingly in the final sixteenth and just
missed for third. BOBBY'S ALIBI was allowed to settle, raced two wide to the quarter marker, swung five wide for the drive, was gaining in the late stages
and challenged for show in the end. IRREFUTABLE bumped with BETTOR TRIP NICK leaving the break, stalked the quick pace from the inside on the turn,
came in tight in mid-stretch and finished evenly in the final stages. BETTOR TRIP NICK broke out then bumped with IRREFUTABLE and was away a step
slowly, rushed up to be forwardly placed into the turn, stalked the quick pace to the quarter marker, dropped back in the drive and faded in the late stages.

THATSABADBOY broke alertly and was prominent in the early stages, ceded the lead to MACHO CHROME nearing the backstretch run, stalked the solid
fractions to the half-mile marker, overtook MACHO CHROME in upper stretch, drew clear inside of the furlong pole and pulled away under hand urging in
deep stretch. MACHO CHROME was forwardly placed into the first turn, assumed command approaching the backstretch run, set solid fractions to the
second turn, was overtaken by THATSABADBOY leaving the quarter marker, was no match for the winner in deep stretch and held well in deep stretch for
second. SKY DINSKI hopped a the start and was off a bit slowly, was unhurried through the early stages, saved ground while advancing on the second turn,
improved position in upper stretch, was outkicked in the drive and was clear for third in the end. WELLSWORT (IRE) raced five wide into the first turn,
improved position along the backstretch run, loomed four wide nearing the quarter marker, could not sustain that bid in the stretch run and flattened in the
final stages. DRAW THE FOUL stalked the early pace, lost position along the backstretch run and weakened. NUESTRO ENGREIDO showed early speed,
prompted the solid fractions to the half-mile marker, raced three wide to the quarter pole, could not keep pace in upper stretch and gave way. CAT GAMER
hopped at the start, raced four wide into the first turn, stalked the solid pace through the backstretch run, lost position three wide nearing the quarter marker
and tired in the stretch run. THE LONNA RANGER bobbled at the start and was away a step slowly, raced in the second flight while three wide on the first
turn, dropped back approaching the half-mile marker, trailed into the stretch run and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF was unhurried in the early going, raced two wide along the turn, was steered outside of rivals nearing the top of the lane, circled
the field while six wide in upper stretch, was full of run inside of the furlong marker, assumed command inside of the final sixteenth and edged away in the
late stages. I'M DR. O rated off of the fast early pace while racing in the second flight, improved position while along the rail nearing the quarter marker,
came within aim approaching mid-stretch, was outkicked by LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF in the final sixteenth and ran on to secure the place. LOVE CANDY
was allowed to settle, improved position two wide on the turn, swung four wide for the drive while making a steady gain, was outfinished in deep stretch and
kept on to secure the show in the final strides. LOVE'EM N LEAVE'EM was sent to the early lead, set a pressured pace to the turn, set quick fractions to the
quarter marker, battled with AUTISM BLUE to mid-stretch, could not keep pace with LMLOOKNFORMISCHIEF in the final sixteenth, weakened and was
just edged for the minor awards in the final strides. CHIEF WILD EAGLE chased from the second flight, loomed along the rail on the turn, ran evenly to
mid-stretch and lacked the needed late response. C'MON MAN lunged at the start, was off slowly and spotted the field leaving the break, saved ground
along the turn, swung five wide for the drive and showed good late interest in the final sixteenth. DR PESCADO chased the fast early pace, raced four wide
to the quarter marker, lost position in upper stretch and lacked a late rally. AUTISM BLUE contested the early pace, raced three wide while disputing the
quick fractions to the quarter marker, battled for the lead to mid-stretch and gave way in the final furlong. STORMY SAMURAI showed early speed and
disputed the solid early pace, raced between rivals while contesting the pace to the quarter marker, lost a bit of ground in upper stretch then came in tight
nearing the furlong marker, took up in mid-stretch and lacked a late response.

Footnotes
PETE'S INFERNO unhurried early, bided his time through the first quarter, was asked to pick it up passing the seven-sixteenths pole, had clear run turning
for home and ran on well to wear down the early pacesetter. TWO TWELVE broke sharply and opened up a clear lead on the field while under a snug hold,
came into the stretch still well clear of the rest, responded when asked at the furlong pole but was unable to fend of the late rushing winner, while besting
the rest. DIZZY DAZMURA came away from the gate a bit awkwardly then fell back to last in the early going, was wide and had only one beaten passing the
three furlong marker, swung seven wide into the stretch and mustered a strong rally to gain a minor placing. RHONDA'S COOKIN did not display any early
speed, steadied near the half mile pole, saved ground through the turn, had only one beaten at the halfway point but rallied from there and was just
outfinished for third. NATALIA showed some early interest while very wide and on the outside of the trailing group in the early stages, swung five or six wide
into the stretch and while not able to muster a rally. AMAZING FLYER broke slow and was bothered by WITCHES DANCE after the break, fell back to last
early, attempted to rally near the seven-sixteenths pole but could not make an impact from that point. TRUE COMFORT got away from the gate in good
order and was content to track the early leader to the turn, was asked to go after that one passing the quarter pole but never found another gear and was
passed in the late stages. MORO FIRST CLASS showed some good speed from the break to gain a tracking position down the backstretch, had to be
asked some to keep position through the turn, was floated six wide into the stretch and gave way. WITCHES DANCE broke in at the start and eventually
into the path of RHONDA'S COOKIN' and AMAZING FLYER, steadied briefly early then made a mid-race move to get into contention approaching the
quarter pole but tired and had nothing to offer for the stretch run. JAN'S MIGHTY RIVER lost the rider and ran off in the post parade, broke alertly, showed
brief speed but was outrun after the first quarter mile, fell far back and was never a factor.
