coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in dismissing the challenge from CHATEAU straightened away, then gamely
fended off SHERIFF BIANCO with ease to the finish. SHERIFF BIANCO three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, continued three
wide into upper stretch, offered up a tepid bid late but was ultimately repelled to the wire. CHATEAU coaxed from the start, pressed the pace from the
outside four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. WAR
STOPPER chased along the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid. IN DREAMS chased
just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths, spun two to three wide for home, weakened. MORE GRAYTFUL chased along the inside under
coaxing from the three-eighths and tired. OUTLAW KID four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn, came
under coaxing at the three-eighths and made no impact. ALOGON broke in at the start, chased just off the inside under coaxing from the three-eighths and
tired. Please note that due to a technical glitch with NYRA TV broadcast operations a head on replay from the quarter pole through to the finish line was
unavailable.

Footnotes
DRAFTED four paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch from the tail of the field, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under coaxing at
the three-eighths, went six wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong and was just up in the shadow of the wire by a
whisker to score. LITTLE VIC away well to the front briefly, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into
upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes splitting rivals to take command near the sixteenth marker, dug in under late threat and was nailed on the
wire. MORELLO bobbled awkwardly at the start getting away last, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide
into upper stretch, dug in heads apart for command a furlong out, then ran on to preserve the show honors. BEZOS showed the way in hand just off the
inside, tucked inside through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late
stages. THREE TWO ZONE inside briefly, chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch
and kept on to the finish but was outkicked.
