JOE'S HAD ENOUGH bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside, began to move up approaching the half
mile pole, raced in the three path around the turn, swung wide into the stretch, drifted at the top of the lane and drew off in the final furlong. COCO SHELL
trailed the field early, began to move up coming around the turn, entered the stretch in the five path and improved position to the wire. FINAL EPISODE
dueled on the outside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the bend and was outkicked in the lane. DIXIEMAGIC bumped with
the horse to his outside at the break, tracked the leaders up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the turn and weakened in the stretch.
IMAGOODFELLA was reluctant to load, broke well and stalked the leaders on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, navigated the turn from the
three path and faded in the stretch. KING SPARROW bumped with the horse to his inside at the start, recovered to duel from the rail up the backstretch and
around the turn and tired from there.

Footnotes
BINOCHE brushed mildly with the horse to her inside leaving the gate, chased the leader between horses up the backstretch, began a bid from the three
path coming around the far turn and drew off in the lane. SUNSHINE GIRL raced in the middle of the pack on the outside through the opening quarter of a
mile, navigated the turn from the two path, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and improved position in the stretch. THAT'S MY CAT tracked the pace
setters on the inside in the early going, raced in the two path around the turn and finished evenly. SARA KALI stumbled at the break, recovered to lead the
field up the backstretch, continued to show the way coming around the bend, blew the turn, drifting out to the six path entering the stretch and weakened in
the final furlong. THE MONEY MACHINE brushed with the horse to her outside at the start, settled off the pace for the run up the backstretch, came around
the turn in the three path and was empty in the lane. FULL TIME STRUTIN hit the gate hard leaving it, raced off the pace on the inside early, navigated the
turn from the three path and made no bid. ANNA'S IMAGE trailed the field the entire way around the oval, saved ground and was not a factor.
