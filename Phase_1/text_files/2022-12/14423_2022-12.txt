OKIE FREEZE dueled on the inside up the backstretch, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, kicked clear entering the stretch and drew off
to the wire. JEWEL OF NAVARONE chased the leaders on the inside up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn, began a bid passing the quarter
pole and kept on to the wire. SILVER DADDY raced at the back of the pack on the outside in the early going, angled in to save ground around the turn and
gained ground late on the rail from there. JON L hit the gate leaving it, trailed the field on the inside through the opening stages, navigated the turn from the
two path and improved position mildly in the lane. COMING ABSTRACTION raced at the back of the pack between horses through the quarter of a mile,
came around the turn in the three path and never threatened. LONESTAR CHROME tracked the leaders on the outside up the backstretch, began to drop
back while racing in the four path around the turn and flattened out further in the lane. LUCK IN MY EYES raced off the pace on the outside early, continued
around the turn in the four path, swung wider still entering the stretch and was empty from there. ROWDY MAMBO dueled for the lead on the outside up the

WENDY'S SONG led the field on the inside racing up the backstretch, continued to show the way coming around the turn in the two path and drew off to the
wire. NOT NOW VICTORIA chased the leader on the outside through the opening quarter of a mile, raced in the three path around the turn and kept on to
the finish. HALEY WHO trailed the field on the outside early, began to move up headed into the turn, raced in the three and four path from there and
continued to gain ground in the lane. MIDNIGHTONTHENILE raced in the middle of the pack on the outside up the backstretch, angled in to save ground
around the turn and finished evenly. K P HARRY KITTY raced off the pace on the inside through the opening stages, came around the turn in the two path
and showed no kick. MORATTA raced at the back of the pack on the inside early, ran into traffic and steadied slightly near the half mile pole, saved ground
around the turn and made no bid. LA DIVINA GUERRERA dwelt at the start, trailed the field throughout and never factored. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS
MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, IT WAS DETERMINED ALL HORSES HAD A FAIR BEGINNING AND NO CHANGES WERE MADE.

SHAKE RAG stumbled leaving the gate, raced off the pace on the outside early, began a bid approaching the three eighths pole, entered the stretch from
the six path and gained ground on the outside to get up for the win late. ELI DANCER tracked the leaders between horses up the backstretch, raced in the
four path around the turn, challenged approaching the quarter pole and dueled down the stretch to just miss. REAL ME dueled between horses through the
opening quarter of a mile, continued to battle from the two path around the turn, and dug in gamely in the stretch, finishing strongly. RAPPERS THIEF
dueled on the outside up the backstretch and around the turn, entered the stretch in the three path and dug in gamely to the wire but was caught late.
WILDSTARINTHESKY dueled for the lead on the inside up the backstretch, dropped back slightly while saving ground around the turn and kept on to the

Footnotes
LENA'S GOLD chased the leader on the outside up the backstretch, began a bid from the two path coming around the turn and kicked clear in the final
furlong. LA CHEVA sprinted to a clear early lead, dueled while saving ground around the turn, could not go with the winner in the homestretch and chased
that rival to the wire. BUNKER DOWN hit the gate and veered in at the start, settled at the back of the pack on the inside for the opening quarter of a mile,
saved ground around the turn, began a bid approaching the quarter pole and gained ground late. POW WOW tracked the leader on the outside up the
backstretch, raced in the four path around the turn and finished evenly. ARTFUL ROSE bumped with the horses to both sides leaving the gate, settled off
the pace in the early going, navigated the turn from the three and four path and improved position mildly in the lane. BELLA BRISA bumped to the horses on
either side at the break, recovered to chase the leader between horses up the backstretch, raced in the two path around the bend and weakened in the
stretch. LANKY LOU bumped soundly with the horse to her inside at the start, raced at the back of the pack between horses early, came around the turn in
the five path and made no bid. STELLA WHEAT veered out and bumped with the horses to her outside leaving the gate, recovered to stalk the pace setters
up the backstretch, saved ground around the turn and tired in the lane. INDY GAL DORO raced off the pace on the outside early, came around the turn
wide, entered the stretch in the seven path and was empty from there. ICY REBEL was bumped and took up sharply leaving the gate, trailed well behind the
field throughout, never factored and walked off. A STEWARDS INQUIRY WAS MADE INTO THE START. UPON REVIEW, NO CHANGES WERE MADE
TO THE ORDER OF FINISH.
