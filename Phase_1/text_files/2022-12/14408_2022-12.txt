NELL'S BELLS raced evenly through the FAR turn rallying five wide to engage in upper stretch being carried out near the eighth pole drifting inside near the
sixteenth pole while drawing clear late. FRAGRANT prompted the pace through the far turn taking a narrow lead into upper stretch angling out to tighten
rival near the eighth pole being carried in by said FOE soon after ceding the issue while saving place. LITTLE FOUR rallied on the far turn vying near mid
track in upper stretch losing path as rival angling out near the eighth pole then was carried inside by a pair of rivals late. ICY RAIN slow early saved ground
to vie along the rail in upper stretch before weakening late being put in a touch close nearing the wire. IRON BERTIE pressed the pace through the far turn
wearing out in upper stretch. CLIMATE reared high at the break never recovering. DIALED ME PERFECT hustled along raced four and five wide to the far
turn tiring there. JANSELLE sent hard pressed the pace from the inside down the backstretch before wilting on the far turn. OBJECTIONS FROM THE
RIDER OF LITTLE FOUR AGAINST ICY RAIN AND ICY RAIN AGAINST THE RIDER OF FRAGRANT FOR INTERFERENCE DURING THE STRETCH
RUN WERE DISMISSED BY THE STEWARDS.
