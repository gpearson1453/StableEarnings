Footnotes
BELENTIME was allowed to settle early, made a three wide move on the turn between rivals, then loomed boldly leaving the turn and hit the front nearing
the furlong marker and edged clear to prove best under a drive. CHROME DIXIE prompted the pace three wide and made a two wide bid on the turn to take
over leaving the five sixteenths, then dueled with the winner leaving the turn and ran on gamely but was out kicked, second best. MYSTIFIED was five wide
on the first turn, chased the pace four to five wide and came six wide into the lane and was along for the show award. FACTOTUM was rated early and
made a mild bid on the inside on the turn and weakened. HE CAME TRUE was well placed towards the inside swung out four wide leaving the turn and was
empty. KEEPING IT COUNTRY set a pressured pace on the inside and gave way. ADY'S MUNNY stalked the pace four wide and tired. TIMES CHANGED

the furlong marker and kicked clear to prove best, driving. BRACES was bumped at the start, reserved early, saved ground on the turn and finished well on
the inside to be clearly second best. CAPTAIN CARDO pressed the pace and made a three wide bid on the turn to take over, but was confronted
immediately by TURNS leaving the turn and then faded the final furlong, lasted for the show award. BOSSY CAT was allowed to settle on the inside, swung
out three wide leaving the turn, angled out by the furlong marker for racing room and had no kick. BOOM BOOM KABOOM set a pressured pace on the
inside and weakened. PEAKY BLINKERS chased the pace three wide and tired. PRINCIPALITY was not a factor.

HOT N SPICY LOVE was allowed to settle early, made a inside middle move on the backstretch to move into contention, then eased off the inside and
made a three wide bid on the turn to take over leaving the five sixteenths and was clear leaving the turn, then remained clear to prove best, driving.
COUSTEAU vied for the early lead on the inside, then cleared leaving the five eighths marker, then was headed on the turn and kept on to be clearly
second best. LOST MY VOWCHER was reserved early, made a move on the turn to move into contention but had no late kick. HOLD THE IRISH was four
wide into the first turn, chased the pace on the outside and had no rally. CAN'T PASS IT UP was reserved early, advanced on the turn and had no late rally.
FIFTY SHEAS OFGREY vied for the lead on the outside and tired. UNCLE JEROME tracked the pace four wide and stopped. BOURBON FRONTIER was
well placed two wide and stopped, pulled up by the quarter poll, bled, walked off. The final margins were made up by the writer of this chart due to the photo
finish camera going down during the race due to a power outage.

Footnotes
DON'T TALK set the early pace in the two path, drew clear on the turn and then remained clear to prove best under a drive. MISCHIEF MELODY tracked
the winner two to three wide and ran on to the wire to be clearly second best. WIN FOR LAILA was allowed to settle early, made a mild bid on the turn and
came four wide into the lane and flattened out, held show award. CEREAL I D was reserved early, made a inside move on the turn and had no late kick,
missed show award. MISS CONVEYOR was off a step slow, raced wide on the turn and passed the tiring rivals. RIPPA was reserved early, dropped to the
inside on the turn and had no rally. THATSJUSTLOVELY tracked the pace on the inside and weakened. GOLD DOLL was settled early and was four wide
on the turn and weakened. LILYSGOTACLUE chased the pace four wide and weakened.
