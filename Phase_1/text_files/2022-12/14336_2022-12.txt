Footnotes
CUSTOM GUITAR was void of the early speed started to make a move on the turn going three wide then moved out to five or six wide in upper stretch to
just get up. IN FOR A PENNY tracked the leaders from the three path then made a three to four wide rally and just missed. MOODY RAFAELA was placed
off the pace in the four path then made a two to three wide bid on the turn to take the lead at the eighth pole but was nailed in the final yards. ROARING
QUINN was forwardly placed on the inside to upper stretch and weakened. ABSOLUTELY MINDY raced back while racing wide throughout and failed to
menace. JUDGE THIS TRIP hustled to the lead from the inside held that position to upper stretch and tired. SATISFY U saved ground to no avail. CHARLIE
SKY raced in the middle of the pack early but was never a threat.

Footnotes
SASSY SUE'S BAND was placed off the pace on the inside to the final turn then made a move between horses to collar the leader at the end of the bend to
take the lead at the eighth pole and drew clear. MO BELLA was hustled along to take the lead into the first turn, set most of the pace, was collared at the top
of the stretch and proved second best. EL CALIENTE LADY raced near the back to the final turn then made a four wide bid and was a game third.
ANOTHERINTHEFIRE raced in the middle of the pack from off the rail to the final turn then angled out in upper stretch and improved position. HIGH VALUE
TARGET was positioned close up in the two path to the final turn and tired. THINKING OF HER raced back through the first turn and down the backstretch
then made a three to four wide bid on the turn and passed tiring rivals. APRIORITY LADY was off a step slow, lugged out slightly in the first turn and was
never a serious factor. WHO DAT GREY went six wide into the first turn then stalked the pace down the backstretch from the three path and weakened.
TAKENFORGRANTED saved ground and not a threat. LA SMOOCHIE broke well then tracked the leaders from the inside, stopped and was distanced.

Footnotes
HOT STOVE LEAGUE was placed off the pace in the early stages then made a move going into the second turn to take over at the quarter pole and held
on. MIAS MOONBEAM was last away then steadily advance down the backstretch moving between horses, angled out three to four wide in upper stretch
and narrowly missed the win. WITT'S TAQUITO was hustled to the lead from the inside, to set most of the pace under pressure to the quarter pole and tired.
TOUGH COMPANY was placed in the middle of the pack on the inside to the final turn then made a rail bid on the final turn to improve his position in the
drive. ALWAYS A CATCH raced in the middle of the pack while racing evenly. OUTLAW X. was in the middle of the pack around the first turn then made a
mild bid going into the backstretch and faltered. DISIDE raced near the back from three to four wide, and was widest of all in the stretch. DREAMS OF
VALOR was always back and not a threat. GUITARZAN popped the gate open prior to the start, then was fractious in the gate, pressed the pace for a half
and was through.

QUIET AS MIDNIGHT was pushed out slightly going into the first turn then settled near the back entering the backstretch, steadily advance from the three
path through the final turn then engaged leader at the eighth pole and battled to the wire to win the nod. PINK HIGGINS dueled for the lead all the way and
lost the nod. TOP HONORS was hustled along to duel for the lead from the two path to the three sixteenths pole and weakened. NERKY ROSE was placed
off the pace while racing evenly. RED OCTOBER saved ground to the middle of the backstretch, made a two wide bid but was not a threat. CALL ME
FIREY hopped at the start then floated out going into the first turn and was never a factor. DONOVANS WARRIOR dueled for the lead from the inside for a
quarter, was through early and was distanced.
