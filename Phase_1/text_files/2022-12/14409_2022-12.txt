Footnotes
BLOW SUM SMOKE void of speed, began to advance in the far turn, came four wide into the lane, continued to advance while well out in the strip, up in
time. NAVAGATIONALBEACON dueled up front closest to the inside, continued to alternate through the turn closest to the inside and into the stretch,
headed, regained the advantage in game fashion, could not contain the winner while holding the place in a continued determined manor. SWEETNESS TO
closest to the dueling leaders up the backstretch. GUEST IN MY HEART went one paced along the inside. SHE'S HAMAZING back off the pace and the
inside, three wide turn, shifted out widest when straightened for home, managed only an even finish the final furlong. MISS DUTTON off a step slow, not a
threat while racing off the inside. MISS RITA alternated up front outside the runner up, gave way turning into the stretch. HALF SCOUT fell back to trail,
never a factor.

Footnotes
CALIPARI off step slow, fanned six wide into the lane, rallied willingly down the middle of the strip to win going away. PIKACHU broke with the leaders,
shuffled back soon after, behind the first flight into the turn, angled out a bit to be three wide when advancing turning for home, bid inside the winner, proved
no match for that one late, clearly second best. STRICKLAND off a step slow, lacked speed toward the inside, rallied for the show. JOE BILL lacked speed,
raced three wide through the turn, displayed some mild interest to improve a bit. DRAG MALIBU set or forced the pace three wide, held a short advantage
late in the turn, faltered in the drive. TEQUILA REVOLUTION within striking distance well off the inside, four wide turn, came up empty for the stretch.
CUNNING broke alertly, with the pace along the inside, gave way in the drive. CLASSIC SHINE brushed the gate to be off slowly, well back off the pace four
wide, not a threat through the lane. CASTLEBERRY with the pace for four furlongs between rivals, stopped in the drive.

Footnotes
SOARING BIRD broke on top, showed way into first turn, headed just before a half, regained the advantage far turn, came out a bit to float outer rivals
exiting that bend, long drive, edged away late under pressure. RUNWAY MAGIC forwardly placed into the first turn, in tight then steadied midway on that
bend, pressed then challenged between rivals late backstretch, long, extended duel outside the winner, outkicked. TIZHOTNDUSTY stalked the early pace
off the inside, four to five wide when advancing late in the final turn, could not match the top two through the lane, clearly best of the rest. PRINCIPE
GUILHERME lacked speed, saved ground throughout to no avail in an even effort. EGO failed to menace while racing in the two path. CAN'T HUSH THIS
pressed the pace off the rail, four wide into the lane, gave way.

Footnotes
WESTHEIMER STREET broke in, within striking distance outside, asked a bit then advanced four to three to challenge by late in the turn, gained the
advantage into the lane, held the runner up safe the late going under steady handling. TIME ANDBEYOND cut off start, moved up to midpack, swung four
wide into the lane when advancing, challenged outside the winner inside the furlong grounds, not enough in the late going, well clear for the place. CAMPISI
bothered at the start, moved up to the second flight, came in the two path for the drive, finished up best of the rest. LAKE HAMILTON bothered to be off
slowly, back off the pace, steered three wide out of the turn, went even through the stretch in lacking a closing response. LOBO IRISH broke back, lacked
speed, steered out four wide exiting the turn, angled in past the furlong marker when improving position, flattened out a bit in the late going. SEEKING
CHROME bothered at the start, void of early speed, picked off a couple of tiring rivals to improve position, no real threat. RIDGEPOINT ROAD lugged in at
the start, was straightened to contest the pace for a half along the inside and began to weaken. BRADFORD off slow then steadied, remained back and was
never a factor. FINISHWHATUSTARTED with the early pace, faltered in the drive. RUDIANO asked for run when forwardly placed up the backstretch,
stopped late turn.

Footnotes
HELLORHIGHWATER took control into the first turn, set all the pace in the two path, turned back closest rival up when straightened for home and drew off
while being steadily handled. CELERITY broke back, lacked speed, advanced through the second turn, steered out to be three wide into the lane, finished
willingly to be up late for the place. ZOFFA settled off the pace, dropped to the inside late backstretch, advanced along the rail to challenge the winner
midway on the second bend, failed to sustain that effort through the lane. GUARD lacked early early foot, saved ground most of the way, failed to seriously
threaten with some modest late interest. TWITTY CITY raced well back off the early pace, moved closer while four wide turning for home, flattened out in
the drive. SMOKIN BOOTS last away, lacked speed while racing in some traffic midway up the backstretch, failed to a rally when clear. LOOKIN HIGH
within striking distance early, was finished after a half. GOLD BUCKLE pressured the winner for over four furlongs and stopped.

Footnotes
ATKINS pushed far into the gap at the break, steadied to race well back early, began to move into the turn, came four wide for the drive, closed with good
energy to win going away. RUNNIN' BLOCK in mid pack while racing in the two path, asked for some run late in the turn, closer midstretch, could not match
the winner late, up in the final strides for the place. YACHT ROCK (IRE) with the pace while between horses for a half, shook off the other speed to be clear
into the lane, proved no match for the winner late, caught for the runner up position in the late going. SANTINO'S FANTASY pushed into the gap, steadied,
void of speed, moved out, four wide rally to improve position. G T FIVE HUNDRED four wide up the backstretch outside, four wide into the turn, improved
through the bend to be closest to the leader into the stretch, flattened out through the stretch. STORM APPROACHING flashed some brief speed between
horses, began to fade before a half. FLOOR IT forced into gap after the start, took up, trailed, angled five wide into the lane, finished with some belated
energy to improve position. EL MONGO lugged in badly at the start to wipe out inner rivals, raced near the back and lacked a rally inside. TALK TO TOKEY
with the pace for a half along the inside, gave way. UPTOWN SOCIAL pressed the issue for four furlongs as well, four wide turn, backed up through the
stretch. MALORIE'S BIG BOY was finished early three wide. FOLLOWING A STEWARDS' INQUIRY REGARDING THE START, NO ACTION WAS
TAKEN.

Footnotes
KLASSY BRIDGETTE off a step slow, raced back early, in the two path when making a mild advance through the turn, continued to rally through traffic to be
up time inside the next two at the wire. FLYIN BESSIE behind the first flight while saving some ground in the turn, shifted out for the drive, late bid while
three deep at the wire, finished well only to miss. D'ORO STREET broke on top, with the pace while three wide up the backstretch, put a head in front turn,
extended that advantage into the stretch to be clear, caught late while between the top two at the wire. PATE in mid pack just off the inside, came four wide
for the drive, rallied late, not enough while widest of the first flight at the wire. UNSTABLE PRINCESS void of speed inside, continued to save ground
through the turn, rallied up the rail to improve position. ARMY KITTEN lacked speed, improved while not a serious threat just off the inside. STELLAR LILY
with the pace for three furlongs along the inside, gave way. ROMAN GODDESS tired while three wide. SWEET SHUGS off slowly, moved up to mid pack,
five wide into the lane, lacked a closing response. THORN CROWN with the pace while between foes for three furlongs, gave way. UNIFIED GURL off slow,
remained always back. MOR HAPPY HOURS trailed throughout in showing little.

Footnotes
MY SIXTH SENSE took control after the start, set an uncontested pace in the two path, continued to show the way by daylight second turn, responded when
confronted by the runner up when straightened for home, held that rival at bay through the stretch under steady handling while displaying good resolve.
KEYSTONE FIELD lacked early foot while racing four wide through the first turn, continued outside and moved closer while in the four path second turn,
tried the winner from the outside upper stretch, could not get by, clearly second best. ALEJANDRO lacked speed toward the inside, two path second turn,
improved position into the lane, proved no match for the top two, held sway for the place. SEARCH ENGINE in the second flight along the inside, saved
ground to no avail. LEBLON in the second group in the three path, moved closer before a half, lacked a further response to be found lacking in the drive.
MAJOR GENERAL in the second flight while outside, three wide most of the way, in traffic midway on the second turn, tired in the drive. ZOOMER remained
back in lacking a rally. MOWINS finished early, far back.

Footnotes
ALBIZU lacked early foot toward the inside, three out to four wide turning fore home, brushed with AIR COMBAT nearing and past the furlong marker,
finished with good energy to be up in time. CAIRAMA moved up to vie soon after the start, dueled into the turn, put a head in front nearing the furlong
marker, led late, could not contain the winner, held the runner up fashion to gain the nod at the wire. EDGE TO EDGE broke alertly, set or forced the pace
while off the inside, narrowly showed the way into the lane, headed in midstretch, was also not able to match the winner late while slowly getting back to the
runner up. AIR COMBAT in mid pack while outside, four wide through the turn when within striking distance, lacked a winning response. SPANKSTER
forwardly placed early inside, in the two path into the lane, went evenly late in also lacking a closing punch. LEAGUE OF LEGENDS void of speed, four to
five wide turning for home, improved upper then also flattened out in the late going. NO SHIRT NO SHOES prompted the issue in the two path, in some
traffic late in the turn, tired. FORE LEFT lacked speed, made little impact after being three to four wide turn. CHIPOFFTHEOLDBLOCK pressed the issue
from the outside early, four wide into the turn, was tiring when three late in the bend. MOJO MAN in some traffic early, fell back and was never a threat.
DEFLATER off a step slow, was never involved.
