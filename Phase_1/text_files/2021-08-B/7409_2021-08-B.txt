holding place. ALLOUTPATRICIA had an awkward start, recovered quickly with a rail trip for show spot. HAMPTON SPRING chased top pair to the half,
retreated from that point. ABOGADA never menaced.

deep stretch, short lead, gave way readily. CACAHUETE close up throughout, bid in stretch, faltered late. GOT THE NOTION speed to the front, led to the
quarter pole, weakened in stretch. BUSHROD in contention for three quarters, gave way readily. PEAR LEMONADE never a menace.

CHECK OUT LINE quick to the front, stayed clear and ran off much the best. CAT'S RHYTHM took up chase after a half, settled for place best of rest.
HEAVENLY MINE inside trip to far turn, leveled off in the stretch for show spot. PUNAHELE brief speed inside gave way. SECRET FORMULA bore out
start, raced evenly to far turn with no gain in the drive. MAYBETHEDAY reared in the gate, lost all chance and declared a non-starter. ROCKY PARADE
never a factor. After a stewards review of the start, MAYBETHEDAY was declared a non-starter after the stewards reviewed the replay because it was
deemed she was compromised at the start after rearing up badly just as the gate sprung.

Footnotes
MYOSITIS MYSTIQUE shuffled back early, outside run to quarter pole and ran past the field with authority. TRUST IN ME wide run from gate, good
position, game in stretch but outkicked. APPEALING JULIA chased leader to turn, took over into stretch, faltered late. SAMOA inside speed throughout,
could not keep up in the drive. QUEEN OF CORONA tried to keep up to the turn, leveled while no threat. THREE BIRDS broke slow, rushed up inside to
turn but was used up and faded. LADY CHANDLER never a menace while far back.
