SERIOUSLY SASSY sprinted to the front, drove clear, led throughout and held on well. OH MY OH pressed the pace, forwardly placed throughout, couldn't
catch the leader, but proved best of others. RUNAWAY HENNY void of early speed, had an outside trip, made a bid five wide and proved no match for the
top two. BELLA BELLE lacked early speed, raced evenly near the back and lacked a bid. MINJI was an early factor, faded and was no threat late.
INNERVOICE raced near the back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

STAR BANJO raced within striking distance, saved ground around the second turn, made a late rail bid and was going away at the end. FANCY THIS went
to the front, drove clear, led until deep in the home stretch, proved no match for the winner late, but was a clear second. STEPPIN' OUTONHER unhurried
in the beginning, came around the final turn on the outside, made a mild bid, but was no match for the top two. HANSEN'S HOLIDAY void of early speed,
had a wide trip and was never a factor. KING ZIPPY raced within contention, pulled up around the final turn and was vanned off. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.
