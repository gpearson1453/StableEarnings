DREAM ON BROTHER cleared rivals on the backstretch, continued to stay clear entering the turn, entered stretch clear and held sway under steady urging.
HACK had to steady early in the race and dropped back to last, stayed along the inside on the backstretch and through the turn, slip thru the rail at the top of
the stretch and put in a solid rally to get up for second. BOUNTY HUNTER chased winner along the inside on the backstretch, continued to save ground on
the turn, entered the stretch in the two path and kept on while saving show. LOVE YOUR LIFE chased leader two wide on the backstretch, entered turn two
wide, entered stretch in the four path and in range of the leader, failed to have enough response in the lane to improve position. COIL TO STRIKE tracked
pace off the rail in the two path, continued off the rail on the turn and into the stretch, lacked needed response in the lane when failing to improve.
NATHANSMIMSY bumped at the start and crowded and bumped multiple times early on the backstretch by outside rival, tracked pace three wide entering
the turn and into the stretch in the four path, and began to fade approaching the final sixteenth. HARPER'S GEM broke in and bumped rival at the start,
drifted in and bumped same rival multiple times early, tracked leader four wide on the turn and came up empty after the wide journey.
