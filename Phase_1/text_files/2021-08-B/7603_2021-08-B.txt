Footnotes
LEADVILLE was slow in the early stages, made a steady advance to the leaders around the far turn, raced six wide into the upper stretch and finished well
to edge clear late under strong handling. KATZUMOTO stalked the early pace from the outside, moved up four wide near the quarter pole, raced five deep
in the drive and finished second best. MINOSO was forwardly placed early on, raced near the rail around the far turn, was two to three wide through the lane
and kept on to the wire. CINDERELLAS PRINCE settled off the early going, moved up six wide near the three sixteenths pole and had not enough late.
FOSTER BOI stalked the early pace, raced three to four wide and had no final winning bid. ARNO'S MANE MAN was unhurried early, raced two wide in the
stretch, lacked room deep stretch and showed late interest. PROJECT LEADER was quick to begin to set all the pace from the outside, was clear nearing
the eighth pole and faltered in the latter stages. THAT'S BIND BABE raced in tight at the break, settled to the middle of the pack early on, raced near the
inside around the far turn, angled out wide through the stretch and had no late rally.

TRINA showed good early speed to set all the pace, dug in inside the eighth pole and held gamely to be clear under strong handling. THIS IS THE ONE
tracked Trina while racing just off the inside down the backstretch, raced two to three wide through the drive and couldn't get by the winner to finish second
best. BUYBACK stalked the top pair early on, raced four wide near the three sixteenths pole and kept on to the wire. GRINNINGEARTOEAR was slow early
on, coaxed along while racing four deep around the far turn and had no final winning bid. QUEEN HELENE was allowed to settle early, pulled up nearing the
upper stretch, collapsed after being pulled up, got up under her own power, bled profusely out her nostrils and was vanned off.

IZ INVINCIBLE stalked the early pace, moved up four wide through the stretch run and just got his final strides under all out pressure. MANY ROSES
showed good early speed to set all the pace, dug in late and just missed in a game effort. BRONZE WARRIOR stalked the early pace, raced along the
inside near the quarter pole through the stretch and had not enough for the top pair. HYDROGEN settled off the early going, raced towards the inside down
the backstretch, moved up four wide into the upper stretch and had no late rally. START A RUNNIN pressed the early leader down the backstretch and gave
way the final eighth of a mile. HOT SEAN dropped back early, raced five wide into the upper stretch, raced widest through the lane and failed to respond.

RAMONCITA LIGHT showed good early speed to set all the pace, raced well clear into the upper lane and held gamely under a strong hand ride. AROUSE
N GO was unhurried early, moved up five wide near the three sixteenths pole and closed in well late. HEAT SEEKING LETA was slow early on, moved up
around the far turn, angled out six wide into the upper stretch and made a good late gain. PEARL DRAGON stalked the early pace, raced three wide in the
lane and had not enough in the drive. THRILL'S LEGACY was rated down off the early leader from the inside early down the backstretch and weakened a
bit the final eighth of a mile. SOMARA was allowed to settle early, raced six wide into the upper stretch and never was a factor. AFTER SUNDOWN was
allowed to settle to the middle of the pack and failed to respond. GARDEES WORLD stalked the early pace, raced four wide around the far turn, was seven
deep into the upper stretch and drifted out wide deep stretch. THUNDER WOMAN settled to the middle of the pack early, raced towards the inside and had
