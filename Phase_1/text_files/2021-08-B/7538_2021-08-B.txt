Footnotes
LIFE MISSION well placed and outside, moved up to gain a short lead three wide through the turn, dueled inside the furlong marker with MOJO MAN, then
drove clear of that one late. MOJO MAN stalked the pace on the inside, bore out slightly through the turn, gained a short lead at the furlong marker, then
dueled and was no match for the winner. MORE THAN GOOD allowed to settle, looped up three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane
and closed well for the show. FAST FIRE allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and lacked the needed late kick.
TOWN CLASSIC allowed to settle, looped four and five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and passed tiring rivals. MISSIN THE BIG DOG
mid pack and inside, saved ground through the turn, got through inside of rivals and weakened the final furlong. NEWSTOME well placed and inside, raced
boxed through the turn, waited, then weakened in the stretch. SAMEDI NIGHT allowed to settle, moved up four wide through the turn, then had no stretch
rally. TRINGALE set the early pace on the outside, lost some ground through the turn, then had no stretch rally.

Footnotes
SIGNS OF GREATNESS well placed and outside, gained a striking position on the two path through the turn, bid between rivals into the stretch, shook
clear, then drew off and was kept to the task. BREZNO allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, closed
fast and edged up for the place. CHARLIE CHARLIE well placed and inside, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals and evened out
the final furlong. DONALD sprinted to a clear lead soon after the start, stayed on when challenged into the stretch, then weakened late and held a share.
SWEET N SILVER ran evenly. INDIAN TANGO hopped at the start, passed tiring rivals. SAVE THE DRAMA stalked the pace on the outside, held position
three wide through the turn, bid on that path and weakened in the lane. I'M A COOL MAN mi pack, gained position three and four wide through the turn, bid
four wide into the lane and had no rally. DEEP THINKER (IRE) ran evenly for a half and faded.
