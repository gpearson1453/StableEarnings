Footnotes
ROMAN PHAROAH was sent along early to set all the pace from the outside, was pressed by Soviet midway down the backstretch, opened up a clear
margin around the far turn and held gamely under a steady hand ride. TOIL AND TROUBLE stalked the early going along the inside down the backstretch,
moved up near the rail approaching the quarter pole, raced three to four wide in the stretch run and finished second best. GRAVES MILL ROAD stalked the
early pace, moved up five wide into the upper stretch and had not enough in the drive for the top pair. GRAPHYTE settled off the early pace, raced towards
the inside around the far turn through the stretch and had no final winning bid. SOVIET was off a step slow, made quick move down the backstretch to press
the leader and faded while racing off the inside in the drive.

Footnotes
STITZY raced up close in the early stages, took command midway down the backstretch, was challenged by Sierra Hotel nearing the sixteenth pole, dug in
and held gamely to prove best under strong handling. SIERRA HOTEL showed good early speed to lead in the early stages, rated off Stitzy down the
backstretch, moved up three to four wide to challenge the leader but couldn't match strides in the latter stages to finish second best. I'M AN EIGHT stalked
the early pace, moved up near the rail near the quarter pole and had not enough for the top pair in the drive. OUTRUN THE POSSE raced up close early,
moved up four wide near the three sixteenths and had no late rally. NORCO was allowed to settle early on, raced widest through the stretch run and had not
enough. TWO CHANCE was slow early, raced towards the inside and had no response. BORN FORCE raced three to four wide through the upper stretch
and failed to respond. BLUEGALE raced five deep into the upper stretch and never menaced.

START SINGING raced up close in the early stages, moved up three wide into the upper stretch and held gamely late to be clear under strong
encouragement. AMARETTO DI AMORE broke to the inside, pressed early on, dropped back around the far turn, raced in tight quarters near the three
sixteenths pole, angled out and finished well late to just get up for the place position. SENSE OF FLURRY settled off the early going, moved up four to five
wide through the stretch run and finished willingly to the wire. MY EAS Z RIDER was off a step slow, raced towards the inside and never was a factor.
ANNIE M showed good early speed and weakened the final eighth of a mile. OH SO BLEU stalked the pace, raced five wide into the upper stretch and
never was a factor. CHAPLAIN dropped back early and failed to respond.

not enough late. PRANKED was unhurried early, raced four wide near the quarter pole and had not enough in the drive. SARJENALLI showed good speed
from the inside and gave way the final eighth of a mile. FIVE ROSES LUNA stalked the pace, raced towards the inside and had no response. MO CLARE'S

WHISKEY PLANK showed good early speed from the inside to set all the pace, dug in through the lane and held gamely under strong handling. TOUR THE
WORLD was slow in the early stages, moved up six wide into the upper stretch and finished well through the stretch run to just get up for the place position.

tired while racing three to four wide. DIDJADOIT was off a step slow, raced near the rail in the stretch and had no late rally. OXWOOD raced five wide
around the first turn, was four wide near the three sixteenths pole and never threatened. MY VOW IS COURAGE failed to sustain a bid. R DEJA VOO raced
