Footnotes
SASSY SUE'S BAND pressed the early pace, took command around the second turn, pulled away and proved the best. RECKLESS SERGEANT raced
within contention, came around the first turn on the outside, made a bid leaving the final turn, proved no match for the winner, but was best of others. EM'S
MISS PRADO unhurried in the beginning, raced outside around the first turn, showed late interest, but was no match for the top two. TRACK QUEEN void of
early speed, improved position, but was no factor. LOOKING HOT raced in the middle of the field and put forth an even effort. CLASSIC SCALE always
raced near the back and showed little. ABSOLUTELY MINDY sprinted to the front, drove clear, moved to the rail and was finished early. RACE WAS HAND

Footnotes
STRONG BEAUTY vied for the early advantage, raced three wide around the turn, dueled down the lane and drove clear before wire.
CRESCENTCITYPRETTY dueled for the early lead, saved ground, was outfinished for the win, but held on for place. SNOWBALL lacked early speed, made
a late bid, five wide and was outfinished for second. DANCE AWAY challenged for the early lead, forwardly placed throughout and lacked a late kick.
INAWIC pressed the early pace, weakened and finished evenly. QUIKFAST N AHURRY raced evenly near the back and was never a factor. OUR LOST
LOVE raced in the middle of the pack, came around the turn four wide and faded. MISS PAT'S GIRL trailed throughout and showed little. RACE WAS
HAND TIMED.
