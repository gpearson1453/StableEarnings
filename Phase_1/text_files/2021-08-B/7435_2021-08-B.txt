THE LAST FLING tracked the early pace and made a three wide move on the turn to take command past the quarter pole, then drew off in the stretch to
prove much the best under a drive. PRIME N PROPER was allowed to settle early and made a mild bid four wide on the turn, but flattened out while being
second best. SENORITA EMMA was reserved early, then was five wide by the quarter pole and came six wide into the drive to be along for the show award.
SHES MY TREASURE was reserved early and was three wide by the quarter pole and offered no late rally. MOREINTHEHAMPTONS chased the early
pace two wide and lacked a rally. WANTING stalked the early pace on the inside and weakened. EYESEEYOU set the early pace then stopped.

C J S SUZIE BYU chased the early pace five wide, made a four wide bid on the turn and drew off in the stretch to prove much the best under a drive.
ROYAL TO BE pressed the early pace three wide, made a two wide bid on the turn to duel for command but proved to be no match for the winner in the
lane while clearly second best. FOUND MY MAN chased the early pace from between rivals, then came three wide into the drive to be along for the show
award, bested rest. MAGNIFICENTREVENGE chased the pace on the inside but offered no rally while passing the tiring rivals. GLOWED was bumped at
the start, then was settled early, came five wide into the drive but offered no rally. GIRLYSGOTTHELOOKS was void of early speed, came wide into the
drive and had no rally. AZIPASS set the pressured pace from the inside and weakened. YESTERDAYS KISSES chased the pace four wide and weakened.

Footnotes
MAJOR SPARKS was taken back early, then moved out and made a five wide move on the fat turn, then went on even terms for the lead by the furlong
marker, then drew clear to prove best while being ridden out. CLEARING WAIVERS was four wide into the first turn, prompted the pace three wide down the
backstretch, made a three wide bid to take over leaving the quarter pole, but could not go with the winner the final furlong while being clearly second best.
JOLTING JOE was off slowly, then was five wide into the first turn, then tracked the pace four wide down the backstretch, then was bumped soundly leaving
the quarter pole, then had no late gain while being best of the rest. TRUMPS REVENGE was rated along the inside, then made a bid approaching the three
eighths pole on the inside, but there was no room so had to steady, then was boxed by the quarter pole, forced way out leaving the turn bumping a foe, then
had no rally. NOT VERY GENTLE was allowed to settle early, came four wide into the drive but had no rally. DON'TSHOWWEAKNESS was three wide into
the first turn while not cornering well while setting the pace, then was in the two path down the backstretch then gave way in the lane.

GOLDENITE was sent to vie for the lead along the inside, made a bid by the quarter pole and came off the rail when leaving the turn and drew clear by the
furlong marker, then held sway late to prove best under a drive. FEBRUARY SON was well placed towards the inside and two wide, then eased out four
wide leaving the five sixteenths and came four wide into the stretch to have aim on the front runner, then was gaining late but could not get to that rival while
finishing willingly. VAIL OF HONOR was reserved early and advanced on the inside on the turn, then had a good finish on the inside but needed more.
MAKAI vied for the lead three wide and weakened. RUFFLED WATERS was settled back early and advanced on the inside on the turn, angled out in late
stretch while offering a belated rally. THE BLUE DRAGON was allowed to settle five wide on the backstretch but offered no rally. BERN N ASH was
reserved early, then was six wide on the backstretch and lacked a rally. CONTRACTOR BILL tracked the pace four wide down the backstretch and tired.

CURRENT CLIMATE was bumped at the start, then chased the pace four wide, made a four wide sweep on the turn and hit the front leaving the turn, then
drew clear smartly to prove best under a drive. TEN AT TWELVE pressed the early pace and made a three wide on the turn, but proved to be no match for
the winner while finishing willingly to be second best. HONEST INTENTIONS was bumped at the start, chased the pace and made a three wide bid on the
turn, angled out for racing room when leaving the turn but came up empty in the drive, bested rest. MOCHA broke in and bumped a foe at the start, then
chased the pace five wide and offered no rally. GOODBYE GREELEY was allowed to settle early, came three wide into the drive and weakened. IN THE
KEY was outrun early then passed the tiring rivals. ITSY BITSY BETTY set a pressured pace on the inside and faltered. DEBENTURE was reserved while
five wide and then was flour wide by the quarter pole and stopped.

driving. FREEDOM BOUND was reserved early, then advanced on the inside while in hand on the far turn, was boxed and awaited room by the quarter

pace on the inside then weakened in the drive. BERNADETTE THE JET was well placed on the inside on the first turn, then moved off the rail entering the

settle early, then chased the pace three to four wide to the turn and weakened. LAS RAMBLAS was reserved early, came wide into the stretch but had no
