DAY THE MUSIC DIED hugged the inner rail while pressed down the backstretch, edged away to a clear lead on the far turn and lasted under a brisk hand
ride. MO ZONE saved ground around the first turn, swung out entering the backstretch, advanced four deep approaching the far turn, had aim on the lead
entering the stretch, closed and just missed. EXTRA MEDIUM , three wide the first turn, moved up between horses on the far turn and gave way in the
stretch. THE QUANTICO KID , along the inner rail while stalking the pace down the backstretch, was under urging entering the far turn and gave way. WILD
ABOUT DEB prompted the pace outside the winner and faltered leaving the far turn.

Footnotes
CORAL SUMMER bobbled at the break, edged up early off the rail, stalked three wide through the backstretch run, chased the dueling leaders four wide
into the lane, leveled off under left handed asking past the sixteenth marker and forged ahead in the final strides. HICKORY MADE rated close up while
saving ground, eased out near the three sixteenths, bid three deep soon into the lane, battled on a slim lead while between rivals past the sixteenth pole,
kept on gamely but just could not contain the winner. CAN I EVER , unhurried early, angled out leaving the far turn while gathering some steam, circled five
wide into the lane and steadily gained. JOYCE G. prompted the pace two wide, drew alongside leaving the far turn, dueled to about mid stretch then faded.
VERYAN sped to command along the rail, set the pace under some rating, dug in when joined leaving the far turn, sparred to upper stretch then weakened
late. MAGIC MELODY stumbled at the break, raced three wide past the half mile marker and gave way. SALAD DAYS saved ground off the pace, lost
contact with the field after a half mile, was eased through the lane and walked off.

switched to her correct lead past the sixteenth pole and dug in under a drive to prove best. SQUARE PENNY bobbled at the break, stalked inside, eased out
into the lane, ranged up to loom past the sixteenth marker, kept on willingly but was denied. JANIESSWEETMELISSA broke inward and was off slow,rushed
up inside to clear,could not contain the winner into the lane and faded. EGG NOG , jostled around early, steadied near the three eighths, raced between
foes into the lane but came up empty. LADY PERRY , four wide, was not a factor. DIGGIN FOR DOUGH was bumped around early.

GOLDEN G , shuffled back soon after the break, rushed up three deep leaving the turn, secured command in mid stretch, drew clear and his rider dropped
his whip near the sixteenth pole. PAID HOLIDAY sprinted clear entering the turn, hugged the inner rail and weakened late. COUNT THE SHELLS , two wide
chasing the pace around the turn, lacked the needed late response and angled out in deep stretch. JUST GO WITH IT chased the pace and failed to be a
menace. TRUE SHIPMAN was not a factor.

Footnotes
SPARKLE SPRINKLE had speed four deep, shook clear leaving the far turn, moved away two wide into the lane, drifted in towards the rail, kept on under
left handed rousing and proved best. MOODY WOMAN had speed three wide between foes, steadied back a bit into the turn, regrouped to advance three
wide into the lane and held well to save the place. MAGIC IN ME drafted back early, circled four wide while making a run into the lane then flattened out
late. I'M A LIL BOSSY had speed between foes, dropped in and chased along the rail mid turn, stayed in range to upper stretch then gave way. I B NASTY
flashed speed and vied inside a trio early on, dropped back leaving the far turn, angled out, bumped with a rival in upper stretch then needed more between
runners. LADY ZETA broke a bit slowly, hustled up inside, eased back a bit into the turn, angled out then bumped with I B NASTY in upper stretch. BOAT
MONEY failed to keep pace inside.

Footnotes
DEGAS hugged the inner rail setting a pressured pace, was under urging in the stretch and drew out. POINT DRIVEN lacked speed, circled the far turn
three deep and rallied outside rivals. NO MORE TALK , three deep the first turn, chased the winner, was two wide the far turn and tired in the drive.
VICTORY ELEMENT , three wide the first turn, was well positioned down the backstretch and weakened in the stretch. SPITBALL raced inside horses and
was not a factor. ROOKIE SALSA raced along the inner rail both turns and retreated. COZZE CAT showed speed between horses and gave way leaving the
backstretch.

BULL SHARK came out at the break and bumped with a rival, corrected and moved up inside to track, got through along the rail into the lane, quickly
spurted clear and widened under steady pressure. IT'S SIZZLING TIME , three deep chasing the early pace, circled four wide into the lane and kept on
willingly to nab the place. UNCLE ROAMIE had speed two wide while taking outside pressure, shook clear mid turn, drifted out a bit when collared into the
lane then faded late. DIALING DIXIE broke in a tangle, dropped off the pace, circled five to six wide and rallied. AW ITE , hustled up early, vied three wide
outside UNCLE ROAMIE, pursued into the lane and gave way grudgingly. INSPIRING JUSTICE , bumped at the break, rushed up between foes soon after
and chased, failed to quicken leaving the far turn, dropped in and saved ground and failed to generate a solid stretch run. ON THE LAM , bumped at the
break, was outrun into the turn then had belated action.

Footnotes
EDICT lacked speed, moved up along the inner rail through narrow quarters on the far turn, eased out in upper stretch, closed outside DON'T DARE ME
and drove clear late. DON'T DARE ME stalked the pace, gained a three wide lead mid way on the far turn, angled to the inner rail at the head of the stretch
and held on gamely. ZIP THE LIP stalked the pace down the backstretch, was four deep entering the far turn and weakened in the stretch. LIFESPAN
hugged the inner rail on the first turn, raced three wide the far turn and was not a factor. KING SHAWN set the pace, raced in the two path on the far turn
and gave way. INJECT THE LIGHT was not a factor.
