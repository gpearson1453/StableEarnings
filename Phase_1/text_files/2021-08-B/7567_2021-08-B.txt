DEAN VERDILE forced the issue from outset, three across around the turn, kicked loose some and was under the whip for the score. TENENCY well placed
four wide, three path midway on the turn, angled wide and finished well. RORY MOR in hand along the rail into the turn, appeared to be blocked nearing the
quarter pole, waited, eased out into the lane and finished well. LOVER'S LEAP three path up the backstretch, angled wide in the lane and lacked a rally.
BOBCAT vied for the lead from between around the turn, chased in the lane and tired. MASSEY HALL broke awkwardly, rushed out to contest the lead
along the rail to the lane and gave way.

well. RENNINAS ROSE broke slow, saved ground, altered out for room nearing the sixteenths pole and finished with interest. HERE COMES MEG forced
the issue, between into the lane, battled some and weakened. CURIOUS MIND set the pace along the rail while pressed and tired inside. SMOKIN ZIVA
two path on the turn trailing, angled out and failed to gain.
