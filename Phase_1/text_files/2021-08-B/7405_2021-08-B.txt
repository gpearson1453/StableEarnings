BAD PAY stalked the pace on the outside, moved up to gain a clear lead through the turn, then drew off in the lane and lasted under steady pressure.
BROKEN LOVE allowed to settle, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, closed well and missed. GUCCI GAL never far
back, held position on the two path through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, then lacked the needed late kick. NEEDSGRASS broke
in, bumping a rival at the start, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch and weakened the final furlong. SILVER
DESTROYER broke out, bumping at the start, was well placed and outside, held position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the stretch and
weakened. LISTO SHARP bumped by both sides at the start, was never involved. RED ROCKET GIRL set the early pace inside and faded through the turn.

Footnotes
K'S LITTLE BILL allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, angled out for clear racing room, made a
steady gain and drove clear late. CATHMOR mid pack, saved ground through the turn, came through inside of rivals into the stretch, gained a short lead,
then was no match for the winner, while clearly best of the rest. POLLARD STAR allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid on
that path into the stretch, angled in and edged up for the show. MIDNIGHT PUNK chased the pace, held position on the two path through the turn, bid three
wide into the lane and flattened out. TENENCY allowed to settle, looped up three wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and evened out.
BOWMAN stalked the pace on the outside, bid outside of that one into the lane and weakened. FOLTYNEWICZ set the pace on the inside and faded the
final furlong.
