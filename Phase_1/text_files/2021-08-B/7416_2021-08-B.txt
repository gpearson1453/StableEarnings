Footnotes
MAMBACITA was four wide into the first turn, then was well rated four wide down the backstretch, made a four wide bid on the turn and drew off when
roused by the three sixteenths, then was ridden out to prove much the best. QUEEN CHARMAINE was a bit rank on the first turn, stalked the slow pace
three wide by the five eighths pole, then made a two wide bid on the turn to gain a short advantage by the five sixteenths pole, but proved to be no match for
the winner in the stretch while moving to the inside, second best. BEYONDSPOTLIGHT stumbled at the start, then settled five wide down the backstretch,
made a five wide bid on the turn to be in contention, moved in by the quarter pole and weakened. LIGHTUPJUSTICE chased the slow pace on the inside,
then was shuffled back entering the turn, then swung out wide for the drive and passed the tiring rivals. IMA BARREL RACER was allowed to settle early,
made a three wide bid on the turn and swung out five wide for the drive but came up empty. ARLADINI set a slow pace on the inside and stopped.

QUALITY STEP vied for the lead on the inside then made a bid entering the far turn to gain a short lead, shook clear leaving the turn, then held gamely to
prove best under steady left handed crop urging. MUTAKATIF (IRE) stalked the front pair three wide to the three eighths pole, then made a three wide bid to
press the pace, then moved in to be two wide by the furlong marker and was gaining late but was denied late. PEEKACHO vied for the early lead three
wide, then moved in to be two wide to the top of the stretch, swung out three wide and kept on to hold on the show spot. EGO was allowed to settle towards
the inside, angled out around the five sixteenths pole to make a five wide bid, mild late rally. NEPAL UP chased the pace on the inside but lacked the
needed rally. CODE RUNNER was four wide into the first turn, then chased the pace four wide and came up empty in the drive.

THEDEVILSALGORITHM was rated along the inside, then advanced on the turn, had to move out leaving the five sixteenths bumping AZZARO STEEL and
forcing him out, for racing room as the pace setter was stopping in front of him, then was three wide entering the stretch, angled in for racing room by the
three sixteenths pole, closed well up the inside to prove best under a drive. AZZARO STEEL was allowed to settle early on the inside, then advanced two
wide on the turn, was bumped by the winner and forced out approaching the quarter pole, came five wide into the drive and closed well but was outfinished
by the winner. COMPASS POINT was allowed to settle early and made a four wide move on the turn and took over leaving the turn to be clear by the
furlong marker, but was caught in deep stretch, bested rest. BABY VINCENT stalked the early pace four wide and made a three wide bid on the turn but
flattened out in the drive. OVERJOY stumbled at the start, then raced five wide by the quarter pole but lacked a rally. HAZEL RAH dueled for the lead two
wide and was roused on the turn and weakened. MISCHIEVIOUSBUD dueled for the lead on the inside and stopped. THERE WAS A STEWARDS
INQUIRY AND THE JOCKEY ON #3 AZARRO STEEL CLAIMED FOUL VERSUS THE #5 THEDEVILSALGORITHM FOR THE RUN AROUND THE

Footnotes
VENICE BEACH vied for the early lead four wide, then made a bid to draw clear on the turn and move towards the inside, then remained clear by the
furlong marker, then was getting tired late but held on to prove best under a drive. CIBOLO was allowed to settle early, then advanced on the turn and came
five wide into the stretch, then switched leads leaving the furlong marker and closed the gap fast late. MISTER MACHO was fractious in the gate, chased
the pace and made a three wide move on the turn but finished evenly, bested rest. PABLO'S SUN was reserved early and advanced five wide on the turn
but needed more in the drive. WHAT NOW DARRELL was reserved early and came wide into the drive to have a mild late rally. CAST IRON ALEX was off
slowly, then was reserved early, swung out five wide for the drive and had a belated rally. MALIBU CLASSIC passed the tiring rivals. AIR PAYNTER broke
in the air, failed to menace. CORNER TAP was reserved early, came into the stretch four wide, lugged in by the furlong marker and had no rally. BONNIE
BILL chased the early pace on the inside and tired. LEO'S ROAR vied for the early lead in between horses, then dropped back and checked by the furlong
marker and stopped. JACK D vied for the early lead on the inside and stopped.
