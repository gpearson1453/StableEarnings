Footnotes
PREACHER BROWN was unhurried early, moved up two wide, pushed to duel into the stretch and edged clear driving. HE BE DANGEROUS disputed the
pace from the rail to the second turn, resisted the winner to upper stretch then was outkicked but not threatened for second. BLUE SUNSET dueled outside
of HE BE DANGEROUS and three wide to the second turn, was still a factor to the stretch then was outrun to mid stretch and weakened. DUTCH
COLONEL was chasing the leaders from the inside for a half mile then lacked a closing response. SPEEDY TOM also chased the pace, was fanned four
wide to the stretch and also did not rally.

MERGIE TROID was unhurried early, pushed up closer on the backstretch, rallied three wide to the stretch then collared WINNING SOUND in mid stretch
and drove clear. MADAME JEANETTE had no speed, settled to the second turn, was two wide to the stretch then could not impact the winner while besting
the others. COASTAL STARLITE trailed to the second turn, was two then three wide to the stretch but finished evenly in the drive. WINNING SOUND
pressed the pace to the backstretch, got the lead from CLEM JUICE and led to the stretch, could not stall the winner and weakened. CLEM JUICE was
hustled to the front, got passed on the backstretch then saved ground to the stretch but did not rally.

HAWK'S RISING was unhurried for a half, bid inside rivals nearing the far turn, was squeezed when in tight and steadied an eighth of a mile out, shifted out
for the drive and closed with a rush to prevail. LONO set all the pace inside to the stretch, responded to mid stretch but was nailed on the line by the winner.
WORKING was settled for a half mile, bid three wide to the stretch but came up empty in the drive. GOLDEN FLAME broke slowly, hustled to stalk the
leader from the rail to the stretch then tired.
