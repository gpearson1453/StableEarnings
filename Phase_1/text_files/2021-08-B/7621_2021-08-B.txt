Footnotes
EPIMYTHIUM came out a bit into his stablemate at the start, tracked from midpack while shifting off of the inside around the first turn, tipped four wide into
the backstretch, produced a five wide blitz around the far turn to sweep past the inner leaders at the quarter pole, forged an advantage from ZOFFA in upper
stretch, and edged clear of that rival through the final furlong. ZOFFA settled off of the pace along the inside, moved early down the backstretch to a stalking
position into the far turn, split foes two wide around that bend to bid for the lead as outer foes did the same turning for home, but was outkicked by
EPIMYTHIUM entering the lane, and proved second best. AWESUMMER lied off of the pace three wide around the first turn, saved ground further behind
the leaders around the far turn, then stayed on through the final furlong to split foes a sixteenth out to claim show. TIZ LIFE stalked three wide, bid for the
lead four wide and between horses approaching the quarter pole, but was outkicked by her outer counterpart entering the lane, chased through midstretch,
but lost show passing the sixteenth pole. COCHISE was off slow and lied at the rear of the field two wide around the first turn, tracked intently while well in
hand from the two path around the far turn, shifted four wide turning for home for clear sailing, but only produced a mild kick. DESTINED FOR HONOR lied
off of the pace two to three wide around the turns, and failed to factor. INDIAN SPRINGS set the pace along the inside, met a trio of bids around the far turn,
and gave way to those foes passing the quarter pole. MY PAL JOHNNY pressed the pace two wide, but weakened between horses passing the five
sixteenths pole. KISS OF CAIRO was off slow and trailed throughout.

Footnotes
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER pressed the pace two wide, bid for the lead at the five sixteenths pole before forging an advantage entering the lane with KING'S
OVATION menacing outside, shifted from left handed urging into that foe's path approaching the final sixteenth, grazed that foe's shoulder while causing
that one to shy, then drew clear to the wire. KING'S OVATION tracked three wide, came under a drive into the far turn, sustained chasing position entering
the lane as HE'SMYHONEYBADGER took over, ranged up to that foe passing the furlong pole to attempt a bid, but shied when brushed by that rival at the
sixteenth marker, lost his momentum and failed to match strides thereafter. RAM tracked along the inside, secured pocket-stalking position into the far turn,
shifted two wide entering the lane, but only managed to chase the leaders home while passing a tiring foe for show. WARRIOR IN CHIEF set the pace while
staying a bit off of the inner railing, met HE'SMYHONEYBADGER's bid around the far turn before being headed by that foe entering the lane, then yielded
through the final furlong. SITTIN ON GO lagged behind and was outrun. THE RIDER OF KING'S OVATION CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF
HE'SMYHONEYBADGER FOR INTERFERENCE IN DEEP STRETCH, BUT IT WAS DISSALLOWED BY THE STEWARDS.

Footnotes
MILITARIST settled off of the pace two wide, smoothly split foes three wide entering the lane, produced a good kick to drive past the leader at the furlong
grounds, and drew clear under light hand urging. HAWK OF WAR broke inwards, trailed the field around both turns, shifted five wide in upper stretch, and
rallied outside of foes to prove second best. OPTIMUS KAT pressed two wide, bid for the lead turning for home, forged an advantage entering the lane, but
was swiftly outkicked by MILITARIST passing the furlong pole, tired thereafter, but just saved show. FIELDSTONE tracked along the inside, improved to a
stalking position just behind the leaders into the far turn, patiently awaited racing room turning for home, shifted three wide entering the lane while aiming to
split horses, but lacked an opening and steadied hard when stymied approaching the furlong grounds, then kept on thereafter, but missed reaching show.
AGENT PETER GRAVES set the pace along the inside, but was headed entering the lane, and gave way in midstretch. WENTRU stalked three wide, but
faded when floated four wide turning for home.

MR. BOUMA dueled for the lead two wide, forged an advantage from his inner counterpart in upper stretch, cleared passing the furlong pole, then tired late
as that foe produced an outside re-bid, and just held. BIG COUNTRY dueled for the lead inside of MR. BOUMA, got headed by that foe in upper stretch,
switched outside of that foe approaching the final sixteenth after that rival cleared, came again late as the leader tired, but missed. BLUNDER shifted off of
the rail and outside of the dueling leaders passing the seven furlong pole, stalked those foes from the outside, but came under a drive to inch closer into the
far turn, but failed to progress through the lane while staying well clear of the rest of the field. WICKED GENIUS settled off of the pace four to five wide, and
stayed on through the lane to claim a minor share. BEACH HOLIDAY tracked four wide, chased under urging around the far turn, and failed to threaten the
leaders. CRAZY GENIUS was keen to place early on before tucking to the rail around the first turn, settled off of the pace along the inside, came under
urging into the far turn while tipping two wide, but failed to make an impact. JOLLY TOMMY stalked along the inside, but came under a drive into the far
turn, and faded turning for home. LEVY was bumped by an inner foe into an outer foe at the start, trailed the field, steadied between horses into the far turn,
then was outrun. THE RIDER OF BIG COUNTRY CLAIMED FOUL AGAINST THE RIDER OF MR. BOUMA, BUT IT WAS DISALLOWED BY THE

Footnotes
LONG MONDAY prompted the pace two wide, vied into the far turn, drew off approaching the five sixteenths pole, and safely held a clear margin through
the late stages. PRINCESS D'ORO stalked along the inside, claimed place turning for home from between horses after LONG MONDAY scooted away,
then chased that foe through the lane and just held place from SEAWARD late. SEAWARD settled off of the pace two wide, got caught five wide around the
far turn, then stayed on through the final furlong with a late kick, but missed reaching place on the wire. MOANA'S TALE saved ground off of the pace, but to
no avail. CASH REFUND (GB) tracked two wide and from between horses, shifted three wide at the five sixteenths pole to attempt to rally outside of the
leaders, but lacked a kick and failed to make an impact. SEQUAYA set the pace inside of a pressing LONG MONDAY, but proved no match for that foe
approaching the five sixteenths pole, and gave way through the lane. CROWELLA tracked three wide, but faded while being floated four wide at the five
sixteenths pole. HELLCAT WARRIOR trailed throughout and was outrun.

Footnotes
LA LA LAND (IRE) prompted the pace two wide, vied around the far turn, drew clear in upper stretch, and held sway to the wire. HARD STRIKE saved
ground at the rear of the field, improved turning for home before shifting two wide in upper stretch, rallied while aiming to bid for the lead inside of LA LA
LAND (IRE), but altered course outside of that foe at the furlong grounds, then chased well. HARD KNOCKING stalked comfortably along the inside, swung
to the four path entering the lane to bid outside of foes, but only managed to chase the leader through midstretch, then was outkicked by an inner foe for
place at the sixteenth pole. UNION SOLDIER tracked two wide and from between horses, but failed to menace while catching a tiring foe for a minor
placing. BOSS IS A PAL set the pace inside of a pressing LA LA LAND (IRE), but was headed by that foe entering the lane, and weakened in midstretch.
ENRAGED tracked three wide, but faded turning for home. SKY TEMPLE settled off of the pace two wide, attempted a four wide rally around the far turn,
but failed to factor.

Footnotes
DAME CINCO dueled for the lead two wide and drew off passing the quarter pole. BEES AND HONEY tracked two wide and from between horses, then
produced a late kick to reach place on the wire. SOVEREIGN APPEAL dueled for the lead inside of the eventual winner, but proved no match at the quarter
pole, then got nailed on the wire for place. LEGENDARY GIFT stalked three wide, then chased the leader through upper stretch before fading.
BUONGIORNO BEE failed to factor. LETS GO ALL THEWAY saved ground off of the pace, advanced to a stalking position into the far turn, but faltered
through the lane. STREET MISSY lied off of the pace four wide, and faded around the far turn. ANGELS OVER ME was outrun. APART OF MY CHARM
was pulled up around the far turn, and got vanned off.
