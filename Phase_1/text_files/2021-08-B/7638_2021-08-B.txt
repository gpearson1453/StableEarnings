Footnotes
MARTINI'NMOONSHINE coaxed from the gate, established the front and showed the way in hand along the inside settling into a comfortable rhythm
through sensible splits uncontested, came under pressure for the initial time three furlongs from home, first by ROYAL SPIRIT before being joined also by
SPEAKING SCOUT through the latter portion of the bend, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, cut the corner into upper stretch, edged away
under a drive holding well to the finish kept to task. SWEEPING GIANT three then two wide through the first turn, tracked the front two to three wide from
mid pack, came under encouragement at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ROYAL SPIRIT coaxed from the
start, raced forwardly placed in closest aim of the leader while just off the inside, advanced on the front with three furlongs to go and pressured the leader
through the latter portion of the turn between foes when joined to the outside by SPEAKING SCOUT, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under
a drive keeping on to the finish to preserve the show honors. SPEAKING SCOUT coaxed from the gate, raced three wide through the first turn before
settling three wide in pursuit from just off the pace, advanced outside and offered up a bid placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths threatening through the
latter portion of the turn, continued three wide for home and weakened in the late stages. DAUNT two to three wide in pursuit from near the rear of the field,
came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and made late gain while never threatening to the finish. SPIN WHEEL
broke a beat slow without incident, went two then three wide through the first turn before settling two to three wide at the tail of the field, came under coaxing
three furlongs from home, angled out six to seven wide at the head of the stretch and offered up some late foot while never threatening. ELECTABILITY
tracked the pace along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun three wide for home and offered no response. DOCTOR DAVIS pulled on
the bit against the rider's restraint rating unkind and racing keen off the heels of the leader through the first turn and down the backstretch until settling when
given some rein with some space between himself and the rear end of MARTINI'NMOONSHINE five furlongs from home, came under coaxing midway on
the far turn, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
JACK CHRISTOPHER broke sharply and showed good speed, pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, took over when set down
into the stretch then kicked clear, powered away under the crop into the final sixteenth then was placed under a brisk hand ride to the wire while much the
best. HOIST THE GOLD was urged along off the pace, chased in the two path early on the turn, shifted four wide outside the five-sixteenths, turned into
upper stretch under a drive and earned the place while no match for the winner. BE BETTER was urged along towards the rear, went two to three wide on
the turn, turned into the stretch under a drive, drifted out in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole and lacked the needed response while along for the show. BACK
TO NORMAL was hustled to the lead, set the pace under pressure from the winner to his outside, vied along the rail on the turn, was roused outside the
quarter-pole, lost the advantage into upper stretch and tired. DR. PERRY was last to commence, raced near the back while ridden along, saved ground on
the turn and failed to threaten. STEINBECK was hustled from the start then ridden along on the outside, dropped back while four then five wide on the turn,
floated seven wide into the stretch then drifted further out around the three-sixteenths and faltered. ILLUSTRIOUS was ridden along on the outside, dropped
back passing the half-mile pole, went three then two wide on the turn and was no factor.

Footnotes
KITTEN BY THE SEA broke out at the start and was corrected, raced three then two wide through the first turn and settled tracking the leader in closest aim
from the two path, came under coaxing nearing the quarter pole, took over command at that station and spun two to three wide into upper stretch, dug in
under threat from flanking challengers and held gamely to prevail. LOVE AND THUNDER (IRE) three wide through the first turn, settled under a hold rated
three wide down the backstretch, remained on hold and was nudged out slightly three then four wide through the far turn and had WINDFALL PROFIT get
the jump on her circling outside through the latter portion of the turn before taking over her lane four wide, got forced to pause in behind that rival briefly
before tipping five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive rallying to steadily gain through to the finish but missed at the end. WINDFALL PROFIT away
to an awkward beginning leaving the gate near the rear of the field, raced off heels early when a bit eager before settling just off the inside near the rear of
the field, tipped three wide into the far turn before commencing a four to five wide bid from the three-eighths circling rivals before tucking four into upper
stretch and forcing LOVE AND THUNDER to pause in behind and alter out, rallied to issue a challenge through the stretch to the finish fighting on to the
wire and was along for the show honors. VIVIDLY (GB) brushed the off side stall at the start and bobbled, tracked the pace along the inside coming under
coaxing near the quarter pole, angled out four wide into upper stretch, offered up a mild bid closing in late when lacking room nearing the finish being forced
to pause before finishing tepidly handled under the wire. GOLDEN PLUME broke in brushing the near side stall at the start, saved ground in pursuit from
mid pack, got let out spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid a furlong out, then kept on along the inside but was outfinished in the
late stages. SPARKLING SKY brushed the near side stall at the start, tracked from just off the pace along the inside patiently handled until set down taking
the inside route into upper stretch, then weakened in the drive. PRINCESS FAWZIA established the front shortly after the start and showed the way in hand
along the inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, took the inside route into upper stretch and was displaced at that station and weakened.
SECRET TIME (GER) came under a firm hold and raced just off the inside just off the pace until given some rein to work with five and a half furlongs from
home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and weakened.

Footnotes
VIADERA (GB) was taken under light restraint early then well placed on the inside, moved up into the pocket behind the leader midway down the
backstretch, drafted behind that foe early on the far turn, shifted three wide outside the quarter-pole, was roused into the stretch, rallied on the outside to
make a bid outside the furlong marker, took the lead approaching the sixteenth-pole and just held under strong urging. HIGH OPINION saved ground while
reserved towards the rear, was roused outside the quarter-pole, moved into the two path in upper stretch, dropped back to the rail outside the furlong
marker, rallied against the fence, closed well to make a bid outside the sixteenth-pole, kept coming determinedly to the wire and just missed while able to
get the place. KALIFORNIA QUEEN (GER) went around the first turn in the two path, was reserved under a snug hold, raced three then four wide on the
final turn, was roused into the stretch, chased the vanguard on the outside, gained with good courage late and got up for the show. TAMAHERE (FR) was
coaxed leaving the gate, showed good speed on the inside of PLATINUM PAYNTER, moved clear in the two path around the opening bend, showed the
way through quick fractions, vied in the two path on the far turn, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive, led while put to a
right-handed crop into the final furlong, was collared by the winner nearing the sixteenth-pole, battled between foes late and was outfinished then just lost
the show. NEW YORK GIRL (IRE) was last to begin, traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled on the outside at the back, moved closer with a
half-mile to run, went two then three wide on the far turn, was given her cue at the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the
needed kick. PLATINUM PAYNTER was asked leaving the gate, showed good speed while speeding away from the rest of the field in tandem with
TAMAHERE, backed off the pace in the three path on the opening turn, tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty under encouragement on the far
turn and dropped out.

Footnotes
WHITTINGTON PARK hustled from the gate, established the front with six furlongs to go and showed the way in hand from the two path, tucked inside
through the turn and was patiently handled, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, received one tap on the right side shoulder and went clear being
given a trio of light taps to the right shoulder from the eighth pole to near the sixteenth marker and was in hand to the finish prevailing comfortably on the
wire. BOINTHEBACK broke in at the start and was corrected, chased three to four wide just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun
three wide for home, proved no match for the top one while keeping on clear for the place honors. WICKED BOBBY shied in at the start in reaction to the
aforementioned foe breaking inwards, chased four wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, continued four wide for home and weakened while just
preserving the show honors at the end. SOMETHING MAJESTIC broke in at the start bumping KOOSMAN, came under hustling and chased along the
inside placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, cut the corner into upper stretch and weakened in the drive. ERIDROMOS broke in at the start forcing
BRADY'S LEGACY to steady in behind, showed the way early on until displaced with six furlongs to go and chased three then two wide in close aim, came
under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. KOOSMAN bumped at the start by SOMETHING MAJESTIC,
who broke inwards, chased just off the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun three wide into upper stretch and tired. BRADY'S LEGACY got
steadied at the start when ERIDROMOS broke inwards taking over his lane and conceded four lengths to the front, chased briefly two to three wide and
pulled on the bit climbing and facing kickback and had the rider guide him to the outside in the clear five to six paths off the rail, continued to pull and stride
greenly into the turn and was given some rein to work with while taking a scenic four wide trip through the bend, continued four wide into upper stretch and
was unable to make an impact. MIRACLE NICKY away to a hesitant beginning conceding three to four lengths to the front, came under hustling and chased
three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, went two to three wide at the head of the stretch and made no impact.

Footnotes
BIG PACKAGE settled on the outside under some urging, was taken in hand while behind a foe leaving the backstretch, went three then two wide on the
turn, was roused while swinging five wide into the stretch, rallied outside under a right-handed crop, had the rider put away the crop while gaining fast
outside the sixteenth-pole and got up under a strong hand ride in the final strides to prevail. CHRISTOPHER tracked the pace on the outside then in the
three path on the turn, was given his cue at the five-sixteenths, gained to take the lead into upper stretch, led under the crop until the final strides but was
denied while able to get the place. COLTON'S COMMAND broke a step slow, settled at the rear of the field, dropped from the two path to the rail on the
turn, was asked while cutting the corner into the stretch, rallied through a hedge opening into the final furlong and finished with good courage to garner the
show. MAMBA ON THREE broke out at the start, settled just off the pace, went three then four wide on the turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, chased
under a drive in the stretch and was out-kicked. GINS AND TINS settled towards the rear, raced inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path,
shifted three wide at the quarter-pole then was asked once straightened for the drive, chased behind foes under urging into the final furlong, moved out
outside the sixteenth-pole, came between foes late and lacked the needed kick. AFTER FIVE was well placed just off the pace on the inside, drafted along
the hedge on the turn, was asked at the quarter-pole, chased under the crop into the final furlong and was also out-kicked. CHARMED (GB) displayed good
speed, showed the way while off the inside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked coming to the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in
upper stretch, fought on into the final furlong then gave way. SHIRAZ tossed his head just before the gate opened and was off a tad slow, raced on the
outside under urging, went four then five wide on the turn, was roused for more around the five-sixteenths, spun six wide into the stretch and failed to
respond.

Footnotes
GAMINE broke out brushing the off side stall at the start, knocked heads briefly with ESTILO TALENTOSO and steadily floated outwards to be five paths off
the inside down the backstretch under prompting from that rival to the outside, tucked to the two path into the turn and was under a firm left grip, head
cocked to the infield, came under light coaxing with five-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, drifted out despite a right handed crop
through the stretch to the finish five to six paths while holding well and safe to the wire. LAKE AVENUE coaxed from the gate, raced four paths off the inside
early on just off the top pair, tucked inside with half a mile remaining and rode the rail through the turn patiently handled until set down spinning just off the
inside for home, dug in under a drive running on to chase the winner home willingly along for the place honors. CE CE three to four wide in pursuit, came
under coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, swung four wide into upper stretch and kept on to secure the show honors in the final jumps. SCONSIN four
paths off the inside in pursuit down the backstretch, tucked to the two path through the turn coming under encouragement with five-sixteenths to go, angled
five wide at the head of the stretch and stayed on one paced to the finish. ESTILO TALENTOSO hit the off side stall at the start and came under hustling to
briefly knock heads with GAMINE to her outside six paths off the rail before easing off a bit to apply pressure prompting that rival with five and a half furlongs
to run, tucked three wide into the turn and continued to press the issue through the turn, continued three wide into upper stretch, got shaken off near the
eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. TRUTH HURTS brushed the off side stall at the start, then got pinched out soon after the start as the field
floated outwards under pressure from the drifting GAMINE from the inside stall, chased four paths off the inside before tucking to the two path nearing the
half mile pole, came under coaxing three furlongs out two to three wide, went six wide into upper stretch and weakened. CASUAL coaxed from the gate, got
briefly floated out by GAMINE before altering in behind that rival to chase just off the inside, came under coaxing tucked inside at the three-eighths, spun
three wide for home and weakened.

Footnotes
YAUPON came away in good order then showed good speed while hustled, set the pace under pressure to his outside, came under coaxing along the rail
on the turn, was asked for his best in the two path into the stretch, dueled inside of FIRENZE FIRE under a left-handed crop, had that foe savage him badly
in the face starting just before the sixteenth-pole and ending about forty yards from the wire with a bump then gamely prevailed. FIRENZE FIRE displayed
good speed, pressed the pace on the outside, passed the half-mile pole under coaxing, drew even with YAUPON in the two path on the turn, was asked for
his best while three wide into the stretch, dueled outside of YAUPON under a right-handed crop, began to savage that foe badly coming to the
sixteenth-pole, continued to savage that opponent while the rider attempted to reach up and pull him off using the right rein, lost momentum in the process,
had the jockeys hand slip off the rein multiple times while trying to gather it up, was finally able to grab the rein about forty yards from the wire while bumping
at that juncture and just missed. CHANCE IT came away in good order, showed speed inside of two foes then was well placed just off the pace, chased
inside for most of the turn then moved to the two path, was driven three wide into the stretch, pursued the top two under a drive in the lane and was
outfinished but narrowly earned the show. MIND CONTROL settled just off the pace, chased inside of DOUBLY BLESSED while three wide on the turn,
came four wide into the stretch under the crop and weakened. WHITMORE settled at the rear, dropped from the two path to the rail while falling well behind
on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, moved out under a drive at the furlong marker and lacked the needed response then pulled up in distress on
the gallop-out and was vanned off. MISCHEVIOUS ALEX settled towards the rear on the inside, saved ground on the turn, was roused into the stretch and
failed to rally. DOUBLY BLESSED settled just off the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, was driven five wide into the stretch and tired.
LEXITONIAN stumbled very badly at the start and was off slow, spotted the front many lengths, angled out at the rear early, was urged along at the back,
went three to four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and had nothing left.

Footnotes
JACKIE'S WARRIOR bobbled slightly at the start, raced two to three wide in pursuit in closest aim of the leader prompting that rival early on before being
shaken off into the turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and continued two to three wide into upper stretch closing in on the front, took over
narrow command three-sixteenths from home, dug in under a drive in stark contrast to his main rival who was tepidly handled and gamely prevailed at the
finish. LIFE IS GOOD established the front and showed the way in hand five then four wide down the backstretch before continuing four wide through the
turn, slipped away midway on the turn and was patiently handled through the latter portion of the bend, went four wide into upper stretch, got displaced from
the front at the three-sixteenths while remaining overconfidently handled, got placed to coaxing at the eighth pole and was shown the crop to the off side
through to the finish getting bested on the wire. FOLLOWING SEA three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into
upper stretch, proved no match for the top pair while keeping on for the show honors. DRAIN THE CLOCK bobbled at the start, chased along the inside
under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened. NEWBOMB two to three wide in pursuit down the backstretch,
went three to four wide through the turn coming under a ride at the three-eighths, took the inside route into upper stretch and made no impact. JUDGE N
JURY four to five wide in pursuit, got ridden along three furlongs from home, went eight wide at the head of the stretch and folded.

Footnotes
LETRUSKA came away in good order then went to the front, showed the way in the two path through quick fractions, responded well when asked at the
quarter-pole then came under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, switched to a left-handed crop outside the furlong marker, drifted out outside the
sixteenth-pole then was swapped back to a right-handed crop and held sway under strong handling. BONNY SOUTH saved ground on the first turn, settled
well off the pace, was urged three wide on the far turn, gained passing the five-sixteenths, turned into upper stretch under a drive, rallied into contention,
moved out under a left-handed crop into the final furlong, raced directly inside of two foes while behind the path of the leader into the final sixteenth and
finished willingly but missed while just able to get the place. ROYAL FLAG went two to three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear of the field, was
roused with a half-mile to run, raced three wide early on the final turn, angled five wide just inside the three-eighths, gained passing the five-sixteenths,
rallied on the inside of DUNBAR ROAD into the final furlong and also finished willingly but just missed the place while narrowly able to get the show.
DUNBAR ROAD was forced in at the start while last away, saved ground around the opening bend, settled at the rear while off the rail on the backstretch,
commenced a rally in the three path early on the far turn, moved out four then five while gaining late on that bend, rallied six wide into the stretch, closed
well into the final furlong, drifted out under a left-handed crop in the vicinity of the sixteenth-pole then was switched to a right-handed crop and just missed
the trifecta. SWISS SKYDIVER showed speed on the inside of foes, was eased back off the pace while along the rail midway through the opening bend,
traveled down the backstretch in a nice position just behind the leader, saved ground on the far turn, was put to a drive in upper stretch, chased under the
crop into the final furlong and had nothing left. AS TIME GOES BY broke in then was asked, moved from the rail to the two path early on the first turn, was
rated just off the pace, came under urging in the four path on the far turn, chased into upper stretch and came up empty. HARVEY'S LIL GOIL was hustled
from the break, went four wide on the first turn, settled nicely on the outside, gained to make a four wide bid under urging on the final turn, turned into upper
stretch under a drive, dropped back into the final furlong and capitulated. MISS MARISSA was hustled from the start, went three wide on the first turn,
tracked the pace on the outside, came up empty on the far turn and retreated. GRACEFUL PRINCESS was reluctant to load, went four wide on the first
turn, settled on the outside, dropped back under urging near the nine-sixteenths and faltered then returned bleeding from the nostrils and was confirmed to
have bled by the state veterinarian.

GUFO brushed the off side stall at the start and settled along the inside at the tail of the field through the first turn and past the stands the initial time,
remained inside through the clubhouse turn before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch, steadily gained to mid pack now three wide before
tucking to the two path nudging JAPAN to his inside into the far turn briefly before tipping back to the three path put to coaxing nearing the five-sixteenths,
got the jump on JAPAN to the seam he initially sought out, spun three wide into upper stretch and got leaned on in behind by JAPAN and denied the move
taking command at the three-sixteenths, dug in under a drive under growing threat to the outside and rebuffed the challenge to prevail gamely on the wire.
JAPAN (GB) settled just off the inside tracking the front from mid pack through the opening mile, got nudged briefly inside near the three-eighths and tipped
back to the two path put to coaxing when attempting to outpace GUFO for first run at the leaders, spun just off the inside for home just off the hind end of
GUFO and attempted to lean out straightened away and was denied the move being brushed just off the three-sixteenths, altered out to the four path near
the eighth pole roused, closed well outside under an off side crop but was ultimately repelled at the finish. CROSS BORDER settled four paths off the inside
near the rear early on and went three wide through the first turn before moving past the stands the first time also three wide, tucked to the two path through
the clubhouse turn before making his way on hold five then four paths off the rail down the backstretch, tucked three wide into the far turn getting placed to
coaxing three furlongs from home, cornered three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild bid through the final furlong to get up in the last strides for
the show honors. ROCKEMPEROR (IRE) saved ground early on through the first turn and through the stretch the initial time before tipping out three to four
wide into the second turn, chased five then four wide down the backstretch and continued four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing with
five-sixteenths to go, went four wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and stayed on one paced to the line. TRIBHUVAN (FR) lightly coaxed from the
start, realized CHANNEL MAKER was intent on the front and eased off along that rival's inside into the first turn tipping to the two path through that bend,
tracked the leader in closest aim just off the inside from that point onwards applying little pressure save through his presence to the outside until put to
coaxing five-sixteenths from home, took over command at the quarter pole and spun just off the inside for home, got collared at the three-sixteenths and
weakened in the final furlong. CHANNEL MAKER came under hustling from the gate intent on the lead and settled showing the way under rating in the two
path through the first turn and through the stretch, tucked inside into the second turn and rode closest to the rail down the backstretch and into the far turn
as the pace began to quicken, came under challenge to the outside and got placed to coaxing with five-sixteenths remaining, cut the corner headed for
command into upper stretch, dug in prominent to the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. MORETTI coaxed lightly from the gate, chased three to
four wide from near the rear, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, went four to five wide through the far turn growing detached at the tail of the
field, went five wide for home and was eased home to the finish.

ESSENTIAL QUALITY bobbled slightly at the start then bumped lightly with KEEPMEINMIND, established a forward position early, was carried out after
passing the wire for the first time, went around the opening bend in the two path while MIDNIGHT BOURBON moved clear in front, settled kindly in second
position, moved closer midway down the backstretch, passed the seven-sixteenths under coaxing, was given his cue with three furlongs to run, spun three
wide into the stretch under a drive, took a slim advantage while carried out some near the three-sixteenths, dueled outside of the runner-up under a
right-handed crop in the final furlong and prevailed under strong handling. MIDNIGHT BOURBON went to the front, came outward after passing the wire for
the first time, moved clear along the rail on the first turn, showed the way through sensible fractions, saw his lead diminish while given a breather midway
down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, was asked at the five-sixteenths, spun into the two path under heavy pressure entering the stretch, was
headed while drifting out at the three-sixteenths, dueled inside of the winner under a left-handed crop into the final sixteenth, fought under a strong hand ride
from that point to the wire and just missed while well clear for the place. MILES D was carried out some after passing the wire for the first time, went three
wide on the first turn, settled on the outside, came under urging in the three path on the final turn, was roused for more inside the five-sixteenths then driven
four wide into the stretch, moved out under the crop around the three-sixteenths, pursued the leaders into the final furlong, drifted in near the sixteenth-pole
and narrowly earned the show while no match for the top two. KEEPMEINMIND bumped lightly with foes on both sides while off a step slow, raced under
restraint in the two path through the first turn, tugged at the bit while rated under a hold, moved closer midway down the backstretch, rounded the far turn in
the two path, was asked at the five-sixteenths, chased into upper stretch and lacked the needed response then just missed the show. KING FURY was
taken back early, went around the first turn in the two path, settled at the rear, moved closer with a half-mile to run, shifted from the inside to the two path on
the far turn, was roused at the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch under a drive and failed to respond. MASQUEPARADE went two to three wide on the
first turn, settled comfortably on the outside, traveled three wide on the far turn, was roused near the five-sixteenths then driven four wide into the stretch,
drifted in outside the furlong marker and came up empty. DYNAMIC ONE broke a step slow while bumping lightly with KEEPMEINMIND, saved ground
while a bit keen under restraint through the opening bend and early on the backstretch, was rated off the pace, advanced closer around the nine-sixteenths,
raced inside while let out on the far turn then was roused at the five-sixteenths and also failed to respond.

Footnotes
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS broke out a step at the start bumping SHE'S ON POINT, established the front soon after and showed the way in hand along the
inside through sensible splits settled into a comfortable rhythm patiently handled until roused spinning three then two wide into upper stretch, edged clear
under a drive to inside the eighth pole and held well to the finish to prevail. TALES OF MAKENNA broke in a step at the start trading a bump with SPANISH
DREAMER, raced along the inside through the first turn before tracking the front two to three wide down the backstretch from near the rear of the field,
tipped three to four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered up a good finish
to close in stoutly late but ultimately had too much to do. SPUN FOR LU LU spun out four then three wide through the first turn, chased three to four wide
coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and advanced four wide through the far turn culminating in a swing six wide into upper stretch, ran on through
to the finish readily along for the show honors. CONSTITUTIONALRAGE grew rank off the heels of rivals nearing the first turn and spun three to four wide
into that bend before settling two to three wide in pursuit out of the turn and down the backstretch in mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths,
swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to offer up a bid a furlong from home, then flattened out in the late stages. LOVE'S MISERY coaxed from the
gate, raced three wide forwardly placed through the first turn and tucked to track along the inside from a loose pocket, came under coaxing nearing the
quarter pole and swung three wide for home, then weakened in the stretch. GRACE IN MOTION coaxed from the gate, raced along the inside early on
through the first turn before tipping two to three wide down the backstretch, went two to three wide into the far turn and altered out as DANCING FIREFLY
got out from along the inside nearing the three-eighths and in turn forced TESSLER to alter outside her as well, got put to coaxing at that juncture, continued
four wide at the top of the stretch and improved position to the finish passing tired rivals. SISTER LUCK three then two wide through the first turn, tracked
two to three wide in closest aim of the leader through the opening half mile, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch
and tired. TESSLER just off the inside through the first turn, chased three wide and was forced to alter out four to five wide when put to coaxing nearing the
three-eighths as GRACE IN MOTION altered three to four wide due to pressure from DANCING FIREFLY getting out to their inside into that turn, swung six
wide into upper stretch and tired. DECREED two to three wide in pursuit, got coaxed along at the three-eighths, angled out five wide into upper stretch and
tired. SHE'S ON POINT bumped at the start by HOME FOR CHRISTMAS who broke out a step at the start, raced three wide through to near the quarter
pole coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. SPANISH DREAMER broke out a step at the start
trading a bump with TALES OF MAKENNA, chased along the inside under a ride from the seven-sixteenths, spun three wide for home and made no impact.
DANCING FIREFLY coaxed from the start, chased along the inside from just off the pace, was along the hedge nearing the far turn when attempting to get
out, had the rider apply a firm left grip and was taken in hand under a hard hold losing position, got out despite the correction first two then three wide
forcing GRACE IN MOTION to her outside to alter and TESSLER to that rival's outside to follow suit, dropped to the rear of the field and went six wide into
upper stretch and tired.
