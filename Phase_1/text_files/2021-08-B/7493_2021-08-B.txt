away later yards. ADDY'S LOVE engaged in close chase through the backstretch, raced off the rail on the turn then closed steadily to take second the final
yards. SILKEN BELLE took the lead leaving the half mile pole and set a pressured pace, rounded the turn at the rail, was caught leaving the sixteenth pole
and flattened later yards. DIMITRI'S ROMANCE raced briefly close early on, ran in the three and four paths of the turn and finished evenly. Bayou Bougie

Footnotes
SPRITZ OF SPRITE raced with the pace inside while alternating the lead with Grandma Schnur, recovered the advantage nearing the quarter pole,
contested the edge at the rail on the far turn, drew clear into the lane and held well under steady encouragement. SPEEDING TICKET saved ground off the
pace, started a bid leaving the seven sixteenths pole and improved off the rail on the far turn, left the turn three wide, dug in under steady encouragement to
take second inside the sixteenth pole and finished well. CHERISH YOUR DREAM settled off the pace inside then eased out into the backstretch, picked up
the chase approaching the three eighths pole, rounded the far turn about the three path and improved steadily to take third later yards. GRANDMA
SCHNUR raced with the pace two deep then took the lead leaving the nine sixteenths pole, came under pressure at the three eighths, was headed into the
far turn and raced close through the turn, but weakened the final furlong. SWEET PIPER settled off the pace in the three path the first turn, bid leaving the
three eighths pole, dropped back past the five sixteenths, raced at the rail on the far turn and showed little further. UNEXPECTEDLY exchanged light
contact with COFFEE AND HER leaving the gate and rounded the opening turn about the four path, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran in
the four path of the far turn and showed little further, while the latter, exchanged light contact with Unexpectedly leaving the gate, ran in the three and four
paths the first turn, gave chase leaving the seven sixteenths pole but weakened approaching the five sixteenths.

Footnotes
PETES PRIDE stalked inside, bid toward the three eighths pole and took the lead at the rail approaching the quarter, dueled clear midway on the far turn
and was steadily encouraged through the lane. GLORIOUS MYSTERY rated a short lead inside, came under pressure approaching the three eighths pole,
was caught toward the quarter, dropped back midway on the far turn but came on again through the stretch to take second later yards. NINE MARTINIS
stalked from the three path, bid toward the three eighths pole and raced close three wide on the far turn, but was outfinished for second in a later duel.
INFINITE REWARD saved early ground then eased outward into the backstretch, bid past the seven sixteenths pole, raced in the four path of the far turn
and finished evenly. UPSY DAISY DO saved ground through the first turn, picked up the chase from the three eighths pole, ran at the rail on the far turn and
showed little further. EARNED THE SHOT raced off the pace in the two and three paths the first turn, eased out into the backstretch but showed little
response. BEYOND PRETTY saved ground. ESTHER'S FORTUNE was not a factor. HOUSE OF LOVE raced off the pace in the three path the opening
turn then faded past the three eighths pole. COOL MO broke a step slow, appeared a bit rank and was sluggish into stride.

TWEET THIS settled off the early pace in the three path, bid leaving the three eighths pole and took the lead two deep at the quarter, drew clear
approaching the top of the stretch and was steadily handled to widen. REATA'S CASTLE took over nearing the three quarter pole and rated a slim lead
inside, dug in to the challenge of Sonde St Blues leaving the three eighths pole, was caught at the quarter, dropped back at the rail approaching the head of
the lane, came under steady stretch encouragement but just lasted for second. HENRY STANDINGBEAR saved ground off the pace, bid leaving the seven
sixteenths pole and angled outward on the far turn, entered the stretch in the seven path, steadily improved to take third the final yards and just missed
second. LUFTY'S KISSES raced off the pace toward the inside, bid nearing the five sixteenths pole, rounded the far turn just off the rail but lost some
ground toward the head of the lane and flattened stride. NAUTICAL WARRIOR rounded the opening turn in the four path, entered the backstretch outside,
gave chase leaving the three eighths pole, ran in the seven path of the far turn and showed little more. SONDE ST BLUES raced with the pace two deep,
challenged nearing the three eighths pole but dropped back between horses toward the five sixteenths and faded at the rail on the far turn. IN THE GOSPEL
rated close to the early pace inside, was eased outward into the backstretch and faded past the three eighths pole. LUCKY PENGUIN raced well back in the
three and four paths the first turn and was not a factor. NAZCA MYSTERY bobbled leaving the gate, rounded the first turn about the three path and was
through early.

Footnotes
BINN GOODE came away a step slow and rounded the opening turn about the five path, left the turn outside, started a bid toward the seven sixteenths pole
and steadily progressed in the five path of the far turn, then dug in from the head of the lane to get up later yards. FLASHY READY RICK drew clear and
angled to the inside to show the way with a long lead, was steadily encouraged leaving the quarter pole then caught flattening stride later yards. GRECIAN
ADMIRAL saved ground off the pace the first turn, started a bid approaching the five sixteenths pole and improved in the six path of the far turn, then dueled
for third inside the sixteenth pole. RUM RUNNER RED settled off the early pace about the three path then eased outward into the backstretch, bid toward
the three eighths pole, closed in the five path of the far turn then flattened in the lane. ADIOS SEE YA raced in the five path the first turn and entered the
backstretch toward the outside, gave chase nearing the three eighths pole, came through the far turn about the four path but showed little more. GET LIT
saved ground racing well back on the first turn, started a bid toward the five sixteenths pole, came through the far turn in the three path and showed little
more. THE SEVEN FIVE settled off the pace about the three path the opening turn, gave chase toward the seven sixteenths pole, though, flattened stride in
the three path of the far turn. YOUREOUTOFCONTROL stalked off the rail the first turn then faded through the backstretch. MELTECH broke through the
gate prior the start, rounded the first turn in the two and three paths and showed little response through the backstretch. TANELEER raced off the pace
inside, checked in tight at the rail past the five sixteenths pole then faded on the far turn.
