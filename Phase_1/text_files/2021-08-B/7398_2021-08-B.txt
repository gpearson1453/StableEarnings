Footnotes
OUR CARAVAN in hand along the two path, gained on that path into the last turn, three path around, angled inside into the lane, quickly found the front and
then drifted in late while clear for the win. INTERNET OF THINGS in hand along the two path, quickly moved to the front midway on the last turn, was
hooked and then took up late when the winner drifted out and then finished second best. VOUCH fractious loading in the gate, in hand four wide early,
gained on that path around the last turn and finished with interest. WHAT R U DOING NOW took back at the start, lagged, three path into the last turn, four
wide out of it and failed to threaten. OXLEY GAP broke sharply, set quick early fractions while being pressed and then was done on the last turn. FLORIDA
ENDEAVOUR saved ground on the turns, angled out in the lane and tired. WHERE YA GOIN OWEN hopped at the start, four wide on the turns and tired.
ENCRYPTION KEY forced the issue and was done on the final turn. Stewards inquiry was posted concerning the stretch run, resulted in no change.
