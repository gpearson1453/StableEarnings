CREME DE BALI challenged for the early advantage, forwardly placed throughout, dueled down the stretch with SEEKING SAWYER and was just up.
SEEKING SAWYER pressed the pace, moved up three wide around the turn, dueled down the lane, was outfinished for the win, but proved best of others.
SILENT TAP vied for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and couldn't keep up with the top two late. LINC'S BOY void of early speed and was
never a threat. FIREINTHESTORM raced within striking distance, saved ground around the turn and lacked a finish. RACE WAS HAND TIMED.

D TWO brushed at the start, pressed the pace, dueled down the stretch and prevailed for the win. SIGUR ROS raced within contention, saved ground
around the turn, dueled down the stretch and was outfinished for the win. HALFMOON REEF raced near the back in the early part, came around the turn on
the outside, dueled, racing wide and was outfinished by the top two. I'M LOOKING UP sprinted to the front, drove clear and lacked a late kick. C'MON VE
challenged for the early lead, saved ground around the turn and faded. WONDER RUN raced evenly near the back, came around the turn on the outside
and was no factor. TOP BRASS void of early speed and showed little. ROCK N SAKE broke out, brushed rival and was never a threat. RACE WAS HAND

MCLEAN pressed the pace, took the advantage around the turn and pulled away down the lane. ONWARD vied for the early lead, forwardly placed
throughout, proved no match for the winner, but was a clear second. CROOKS REBEL raced within striking distance, came around the turn on the outside,
made a wide bid and got up for the show. HONUS went to the front, saved ground and weakened. THATS IT IMLEAVING void of early speed and was
never a factor. MORE THAN BLESSED always raced near the back and was outrun. RACE WAS HAND TIMED

an outside trip, made a steady gain and got up for the show. MERLIN'S SISTER raced in the middle of the field, made a mild bid and missed the show
position. ZIONICA went to the front, drove clear, saved ground and faded. BACKGATE BELLE raced near the back, improved position, but was no factor.
WIND ZEE raced within contention, saved ground around the second turn and faded. SHARPERTHANME void of early speed and was never close.
