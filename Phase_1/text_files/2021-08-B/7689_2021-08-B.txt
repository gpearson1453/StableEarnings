SQUAD UP well placed and outside, gained a striking position three wide through the turn, bid on that path into the lane, made a steady gain and drew off
late. ETTAPLACE set the pace on the inside, stayed on when challenged at the furlong marker, then weakened late and held the place. SAILOR'S SALUTE
allowed to settle, saved ground through the turn, angled widest in the stretch and had a mild gain for the show. TUDOX ROADSTER stalked the pace from
between rivals, held position on the two path through the turn, bid on that path and weakened in the lane. DINNER FOR TWO was a brief factor and faded
inside.

Footnotes
BETTYS BOMBER mid pack, moved up two and three wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane, made a steady gain and drove clear late. SILVER
DOLLAR CITY tracked the pace, saved ground through the turn, angled out to bid three wide into the stretch, shook clear, then drew off and was no match
for the winner late. HEY SACH well placed and outside, held position three and four wide through the turn, bid four wide into the lane and lacked the needed
late kick. THREE O ONE allowed to settle, saved ground on the two path through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and got up for a share. SEMI
AUTOMATIC allowed to settle, moved up up two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane and had a mild gain. PATHWAY TO VICTORY
allowed to settle, looped two and three wide through the turn, bid three wide into the lane, angled out and improved position. NOT QUITE WRIGHT mid
pack, looped five wide through the turn, fanned widest into the lane and ran evenly. WILD CHASE showed little. SURPRISE KICK set the pace just off the
rail, lost some ground through the turn, then had no stretch rally. HUNTIN' THE RUT vied for the early lead on the inside, came through inside of rivals and
faded in the stretch. DONALDSON stalked the pace on the outside and faded three wide through the turn.
