SUBZERO PLUS stalked the early leader, was a factor on the turn and with the lead from the four path at the top of the stretch drew off. BLONDE
ATTITUDE showed speed from the outside and had a clear lead on the turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and was no match for the winner.
ORBITING THE SKY was off slow, saved ground on the turn and was up for show. PASTEL EMILY was up close and hustled along on the turn but from the
three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. OUR PETUNIA was away alertly and roused on the turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch
had no response.

SUPER GARNER broke inward, had a clear lead on the turn and from the three path through the stretch proved best. WHAT'S ON TAP was off the pace,
had a mild gain on the turn and from the eight path at the top of the stretch rallied late. GROUNDHOG DAY was in range and moved up on the turn but from
the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. TALE OF VIENNA was bumped at the start and raced evenly on the turn but from the six path at the top
of the stretch was all out. YES PLEASE was unhurried early and was hustled along on the turn but from the seven path at the top of the stretch was no
threat. BADJEROS BOY was off slow and closed the gap on the turn but had no impact. MIA'S EXTORTIONIST was in touch and roused on the turn but
had no response. THOR'S THUNDER stalked the early leader but chased on the turn and dropped back through the stretch. A CLAIM OF FOUL BY THE
RIDER ON TALE OF VIENNA AGAINST SUPER GARNER FOR ALLEGED INTERFERENCE AT THE START WAS NOT ALLOWED.

unhurried early, gained ground on the far turn and from the six path at the top of the stretch finished well. LENCHES GIMME set the pace and had the lead
on the far turn but was headed at the top of the stretch and gave way. BLONDILIKESTODANCE settled off the pace and moved up on the far turn but
leveled off in deep stretch. JACK'S MEMORY was in touch and saved ground on the far turn but had no rally. TACKLE THE NORTH was in mid pack and
had a good position on the far turn but from the four path at the top of the stretch weakened. SILENT CHARITY was off the pace and raced evenly on the far

SEAU was off slow and in tight on the turn, angled out in upper stretch and drew clear. AWESOME MINER forced the early pace, had a slim lead on the
turn and from the three path at the top of the stretch held place. STRATEGIC VISION set a pressured pace and dueled on the turn but had nothing left.
DRENA'S BULLET was in range, roused on the turn and from the five path at the top of the stretch was up for a share. FOUR KNIGHTS had no speed and
raced evenly on the turn but from the five path at the top of the stretch needed more. BANGOR RIDGE was in touch and a factor on the turn but from the
four path at the top of the stretch faded. DUKE OF MIAMI was off the pace and showed little in a dull effort.

evenly. TRICKERATION was well back, trailed the field on the turn and passed tired foes through the stretch. MY GINNY BEAR set the pace and dueled on
the far turn but from the three path at the top of the stretch had nothing left. LETTER ROLL was off the pace, showed little and from the six path at the top of
