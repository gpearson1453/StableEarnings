Footnotes
SHIPS JEWEL dueled early, edged clear on on the turn and held sway in the stretch. ATLANTIS ALANA leaned out at the start, chased the pacesetter and
stayed on willingly in the stretch. CHARM AND SARCASM settled while three wide, moved closer on the turn and managed a mild four wide rally in the
stretch. LITTLE LOVE SHACK was bothered at the start and passed tired ones. PAPA'S SECRET never menaced. CALIFORNIA DREAMER raced
forwardly while three wide and weakened. SWANKY LISA was always outrun. HOLIDAY ROMANCE retreated. POLAR'S GRACE took no part.
