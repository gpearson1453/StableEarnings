the pace, hustled up three to four wide at the quarter pole, remained in pursuit for the leader, edged up closer but could not reach. SUPER DUDE was

ground into the lane and stayed on for show. MR. BIG NEWS rated in range through early stages, roused three wide midway around the turn, hustled up
into the lane but had no late kick. PIT BOSS settled near the inside, shifted out four wide in the lane and lacked a needed rally. CARAMEL CHIP settled

IN SKY WE TRUST lacked early kick and raced behind the speed, was ridden along two to three wide around the turn, went four to five wide into the lane,
gathered momentum under steady urging and kicked clear. BROTHER SATCHMO sped to the lead at the start, held firm inside around the turn, cut the
corner into the lane, stayed on with response but could not hold off the bid from the winner. JOHN THE BEAR raced three wide in range around the turn, ran
on four wide into the lane and sustained a steady bid for a share. FLANK SPEED was forwardly placed in opening stages, went three wide into the lane then
flattened in the final sixteenth. STREET SILENCE raced in range inside around the turn, switched out two wide then weakened in the lane. LOVIELEE raced
off the pace, went wide into the lane and had no response. TEMPTING MOMENT showed brief response then faded.

EQUAL JUSTICE was forwardly placed and stalked the pacesetter through early stages, was ridden along trying to reach the leader around the far turn,
advanced to challenge HERCULES HARBOR for the late lead, dug in gamely and won the nose bob. HERCULES HARBOR set the pace through the
backstretch and held firm around the turn, continued on top with a furlong left to run, came under attack from EQUAL JUSTICE in late stages, fought back
gamely and lost the nose bob. HELLFIRE BOB was allowed to settle out of the gate, continued unhurried through the backstretch, picked up the pace three
to four wide into the lane, sustained a steady bid and gained a share. TOP BOMB tracked in range through early stages, went five to six wide into the lane
and had no late response. LUIS TWO GUNS stalked inside through early stages, cut the corner entering the lane and steadily faded.

DREAMING OF GERRY raced off the clear top two leaders through early stages, picked up the pace late on the turn, launched a four wide at the head of
the lane, responded gamely, quickly gained the advantage, angled in two wide and finished well clear. COOL COMEDIAN raced off the clear top two
leaders, saved ground and picked up the pace late on the turn, tipped two wide heading into stretch run, stayed on with response but had to settle for
second best. FLYING WITH ANGELS got in tight quarters between foes and steadied in early stages, raced off the pace, hustled up five wide into the lane,
showed response and got up late to capture show. LIDSTROM tracked the early pacesetter, advanced to engage OUT WORK'N near the quarter pole, was
no match when the winner kicked by shortly after, evened out in late stages and lost show. OUT WORK'N sped to the lead at the start and set the clear
pace, hustled up two wide nearing the upper stretch, got collared for the lead and weakened. MOHAAFETH raced off the pace, went wide into the lane and
never menaced. ON A WHIM steadied shortly after the start, lacked speed, saved ground and had never threatened.

TURNSTONE settled nicely and rated off the top flight, launched a four wide bid at the head of the lane, dug in under steady pressure, gained the
advantage from RAVIR in the final sixteenth and finished clear. RAVIR stalked the top flight near the inside in early stages, was ridden up two wide late on
the far turn, gained control over the lead, stayed on with response on top but could not hold off the bid from the winner. BIG BAD DIVA prompted the pace,
edged by in hand to take a slim lead late on the turn, got collared by RAVIR at the head of the lane then stayed on two to three wide for a share. STAR
RULES wad unhurried through early stages, hustled up three to four wide into the lane and lacked a needed rally. GIDGET set a pressured pace, got
collared late on the far turn then retreated.
